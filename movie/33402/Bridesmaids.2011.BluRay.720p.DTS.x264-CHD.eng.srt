2
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,302
- I'm so...
- I'm so glad you called.

3
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,343
I'm so glad
you were free.

4
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,304
God,
I love your eyes.

5
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,725
Okay, now what?

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,516
Cup my balls.

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,397
- Okay, yes.
- All right. I can do that.

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,858
- Oh! There it is.
- There we go.

9
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,939
That feels good.

10
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,310
You know what to do.

11
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,572
Okay, you know what?
Slow it down, slow it down.

12
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,529
Okay.
Slow it down.

13
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,368
There we go.
How's that?

14
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,293
That's good, nice and slow.
See? Doesn't that feel good?

15
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,585
Yeah.
No, I want to go fast.

16
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,504
You want to go fast?
Fast.

17
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,251
Yeah. No...

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,677
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.

19
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,095
Oh, Yeah.

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,342
Yeah.

21
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,926
Okay.
You know what?
I think...

22
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,852
I think maybe
we are on different
rhythms here.

23
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,735
I was having a nightmare.
I was so scared.

24
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,322
Good morning.

25
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,905
You look beautiful.

26
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,327
No, I'm sure
I look terrible.

27
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,370
I just woke up.
Are you kidding?

28
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,244
I'm sure I'm a mess.

29
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,499
You slept over.

30
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,248
I did.

31
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,921
I thought we had
a rule against that.

32
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,122
Oh.

33
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,083
I'm kidding.
Oh.

34
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,542
That was funny.
I'm kidding.

35
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,503
You're funny
in the morning.

36
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,179
I like hanging out
with you.
Oh. Yeah.

37
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,679
I love hanging out with you.
I think we get
along really well

38
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,433
and you're so sexy.

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,355
I know.

40
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,728
I just have a lot
coming up at work

41
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,485
and I don't want
to make promises
I can't keep.

42
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,365
You know what I mean?
I know you do.

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,408
Yeah.
We're on the same page.

44
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,454
I'm not looking for
a relationship right now,
either. Let's just say that.

45
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,373
Whatever you wanna...
I can do...

46
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,373
I'd rather just...
I like simple...
I'm not like other girls.

47
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,547
I'm not like,
"Be my boyfriend!"
Unless you were like, "Yeah!"

48
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,624
Then I'd be like,
"Maybe."

49
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,002
Mmm. But let's not.

50
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,133
I don't want that either.

51
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,396
Wow, this is so awkward.
I really want you to leave,

52
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,275
but I don't know how to say it
without sounding like a dick.

53
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,049
Come on!
Hands behind your heads!
Let's go! Sit-ups!

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,595
You're looking
like pieces of bacon
on a plate.

55
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,593
It's disgusting!
I smell the fat!

56
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,258
- He scares me.
- Me, too.

57
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,468
But he's
an excellent motivator.

58
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,765
That's true.

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,812
What are you looking at?

60
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,057
Oh, Shit, he sees us.
Oh, God.

61
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,897
Hey! Hey!

62
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,856
If you want to
take this class,

63
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,029
you're going to
have to pay for it

64
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,114
like the rest
of these bitches!

65
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,285
What, are you dancing?
In the park...
Dance class?

66
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,242
You are not dancing.
You are not
dancing in the park!

67
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,247
- Go, go, go, go!
- Freeloaders!

68
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,495
I'm coming over there.

69
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,118
- Is he coming?
- I'm coming after you!

70
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,579
Sorry, Rodney.
We're on a budget.

71
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,006
- Oh, come on!
- It's only 12 bucks!

72
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,591
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,256
Come on!
You fucking freeloaders.

74
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,677
We are out
of our minds.
I know.

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,758
That's okay.
I'm so glad that
we got to do this.

76
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,059
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

77
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,685
Mmm. I've been
in Chicago a lot.

78
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,768
I know.
Sleeping at Dougie's house.

79
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,474
Well, it's just
closer to work.

80
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,062
How is it going
with him anyway?

81
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,019
I don't know.
I mean, it's fine,

82
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
but I just feel
like he's been
distant lately.

83
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,857
And I don't know...

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,408
He calls me
"dude" a lot.

85
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
That doesn't mean anything.

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,074
I think everything is fine.

87
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,621
I don't know.
Anyway,

88
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,453
what did you
do last night?

89
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
Umm...

90
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,952
What did you
do last night?

91
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,961
You are not
telling me something.

92
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,380
I hung out with
Ted for a little bit.

93
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,384
I knew it!
We had fun.

94
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,548
It was fun.
Here's what I
don't like about it.

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,935
You hate yourself
after you see him,
every time.

96
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,220
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

97
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,772
and it's almost
like you're doing it

98
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,357
because you feel
bad about yourself.

99
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,149
He called me late,
and we hung out.

100
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,855
It wasn't a big deal.
And you know what?
It was fun.

101
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,323
Ew! You had
sex with him.

102
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,662
We had an
adult sleepover.

103
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,370
Ooh. Did you let him
sleep over in your mouth?

104
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,503
Annie!
I'm sorry!

105
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,499
You're unbelievable.
He kept putting
it near my face.

106
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:56,966
They do that,
don't they?

107
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,175
Why do they do that?
Let us offer.

108
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,502
If we don't offer...

109
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,595
Please.
You're supposed
to slap it away.

110
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
I couldn't.

111
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,554
You don't want to
look right at it.

112
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,847
No.

113
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,976
It's too aggressive.
It's like...

114
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,432
"Hello."

115
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,561
That's my impression.

116
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,608
Those are the balls?

117
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,276
Yeah.
I'm trying to make it round,

118
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,986
but I can't
because I have elbows.

119
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,695
He is so hot, though.

120
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,033
Look, I know
you say he's cute
and all that stuff,

121
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,079
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?

122
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,157
You're a total catch,
and any guy

123
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,284
would be psyched
to be your man.

124
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,712
You should just
make room

125
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,252
for somebody who
is nice to you.

126
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,333
You know what?
He's honest!

127
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,168
He told me that
we are what we are

128
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,045
and we're just having fun.
And I like that.

129
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,348
He also told you that
you need dental work.
He's an asshole.

130
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,221
I don't need dental work.

131
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,893
You're right.

132
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,186
There is nothing
wrong with my teeth.

133
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,188
You are so beautiful.

134
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
Will you marry me?
Yes.

135
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,651
I love you.

136
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,496
I don't want to
go to work today.
Mmm-mmm.

137
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,664
Let's see how many
times Terry's called me.

138
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
Oh! Only 15!

139
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,371
You know what, Terry?
I don't want

140
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,248
to pick up your
monkey lamps.
Sorry!

141
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,416
Monkey lamps?

142
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,375
Ugh. I cannot wait
to never work for
a psychopath again.

143
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,967
Oh! Annie!

144
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,013
I'm sorry. I should
have gone down Mason.

145
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,675
Well, I'm the genius
that opened a bakery
during the recession.

146
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,098
They were good cakes,
Annie.

147
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,520
Thank you.

148
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,724
Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.

149
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,564
Do you have any
ideas of styles?

150
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,818
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think, honey?

151
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,111
Whatever you want.

152
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,242
Look at how you guys
are making this
decision together.

153
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,453
That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?

154
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

155
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,870
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.

156
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,666
You cannot
trust anybody, ever.

157
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,967
Especially someone
you're in a
relationship with.

158
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,465
'Cause they're
living with you,
you don't

159
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,095
know who you're
sleeping next to.
It is scary.

160
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,800
I mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.

161
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,972
It is scary.

162
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,848
So did you guys
want to look at
these engagement rings?

163
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,184
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.

164
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,609
I'll be here.

165
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,824
Thank you.

166
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
What was that about?

167
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,576
Umm, nothing.
They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

168
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,827
And no wonder.
You're selling
lifelong happiness.

169
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,955
You're not telling everyone
about your problems

170
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,536
and how your
boyfriend left you,

171
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,207
and maybe marriage
will work out.

172
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,835
Show me your
"love is eternal" face.

173
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,512
No, that's two years,
four years tops.
That is not eternal.

174
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,341
Kahlua, can you
come over here
for a second, please?

175
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,175
What's up, Don-Don?

176
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,848
You make up
the best nicknames.

177
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,722
You don't need
a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.

178
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,019
Don't sue me
for touching you.

179
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,652
Show Annie your
"love is eternal" face.

180
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,865
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.

181
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,409
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.

182
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,077
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?

183
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,207
Look, I'm trying
really hard.

184
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,417
You've just
got to try harder.

185
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,294
The whole reason
you have got this job,
Annie,

186
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,343
is because your mom
is my sponsor in AA,
and I'm doing her a favor.

187
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,418
I understand.

188
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,047
Oscar, get back to work.

189
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,933
You shouldn't be
behind the counter.

190
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,901
Andrew,
you are not the father!

191
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,738
That's great. Yeah.

192
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,573
Stop that.
Don't do that.

193
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,823
Hey, Brynn.

194
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,282
Oh, hey, roomie.

195
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,084
Guess what
happened to me today.
Hmm. What?

196
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,290
I got a free tattoo.
You did what?

197
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,211
I could not believe it.
The guy said,
"Do you want a tattoo?"

198
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,257
Just a random...

199
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,126
Yeah, opened up
the side of his van.
No.

200
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,632
He said, "it's for free!"
And I said, "Sure."

201
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,054
You said yes?
Yeah!

202
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,508
Yeah. Look.
See here?

203
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,968
What is it?

204
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,095
See that?

205
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,684
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!

206
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,107
It's a Mexican drinking worm.

207
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,444
It's a Native American
symbol meaning "wasted."

208
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,521
Okay, Brynn,
just so you know,
it's...

209
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,232
Gil, hi.
Hello. How are you?

210
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,989
Have you seen
your sister's tattoo?
It's really infected.

211
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.

212
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,486
Yeah, a little bit.

213
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,913
Stick some
frozen peas on there.

214
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,036
Yeah. It can't hurt.
All right.

215
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,459
So, I just wanted
a quick word.

216
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,371
You know that
tomorrow the rent is due.

217
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,626
I was getting my check,
and I wondered

218
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,964
if I could get
your check, too?

219
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,293
Yes.
I'm getting
the money.

220
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,049
It's been
a little slow.

221
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,055
You have to
keep it in the bag
and put the bag on it.

222
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,726
So, the check?

223
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,894
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

224
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,322
Because it's a kind of,
like, "needing it
today"-type situation.

225
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,489
It's coming.

226
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,160
- Who is it?
- Me!

227
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,324
Who is it?

228
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,281
Oh, my God.
Hurry up, your creepy
neighbor asked me

229
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,911
if I wanted to
watch the news again.

230
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,537
Sorry.
He is so gross.

231
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,086
- Please, come on in.
- Let me take your magazines.

232
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,256
Welcome to the magazine
and wine party. Ooh!

233
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,216
Have a seat.

234
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,544
I'm very happy
that you are here.

235
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,676
What?
Because I want
to eat an apple.

236
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,300
Would you like
some apple?

237
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,558
What is that?
I got engaged.

238
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,226
What?
He asked me last night.

239
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,978
What?
I know!

240
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,525
That's why he's
been acting so weird

241
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,773
'cause he's a terrible liar,
and he thought he
was gonna blow it.

242
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,899
He was ignoring
me and I thought

243
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,112
he was going to
break up with me.

244
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,314
Oh, my gosh.

245
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,651
Oh, my gosh!

246
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,823
I know!

247
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,404
Lil!

248
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,951
I'm shocked, still.

249
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,532
But I'm happy.
Can you believe this?

250
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,414
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I just got hot.

251
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,749
You did?
Are you okay?

252
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,795
Yes. My pits
are sweating.

253
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,463
My stomach hurts. I'm hot.
What does that mean?

254
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,713
Oh, my God!
What is happening?

255
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,962
I don't know.
I'm wearing a ring.

256
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,633
I can't believe it.

257
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,885
Lil, you're getting married.

258
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,264
I'm getting married.

259
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,884
And you'll be
my maid of honor.

260
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,471
God, of course I will!

261
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,931
It will be super fun.
It's gonna be really fun.

262
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,062
Yeah. You know,
we can plan
everything together.

263
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,690
My God!
Planning your wedding...

264
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,027
Are you sure
you're up for it?

265
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,356
I know it's a lot to ask
and to put on your plate.

266
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,409
And you're going
through a tricky time,
and you're super-busy...

267
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,985
Stop.
It's a lot to ask.

268
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,115
Stop.
Okay.

269
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,949
It's fine. And I'm
more than happy to do it,
and it's not too much.

270
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,289
Oh! Look at that.
It's my fianc?calling.

271
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,832
Oh, your fianc?

272
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,504
Hi, baby,
what's up?

273
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,964
it's Annie.
I just told her!
Yeah, she's so happy.

274
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,340
No, I'm not!

275
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,592
"Yay," she said.

276
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,633
What, baby?

277
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,059
I know,
I miss you, too.

278
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,684
Yeah,
I'll meet you in an hour.

279
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,850
I love you, too.

280
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,628
Wow.

281
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,884
Wynonna Judd.

282
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,719
That's really good.

283
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,550
Painting those giant bangs
was a royal pain in my can.

284
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,681
And those teeth!
I should have
painted her mouth shut.

285
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,146
Can you just get dressed?
We're gonna be late
for the engagement party.

286
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,347
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, honey.
What?

287
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
Forgot to tell you.
What?

288
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,486
I signed up to
speak at AA tonight,
and I just have to.

289
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,777
Mom!
No.

290
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,356
I forgot. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

291
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,908
I keep telling you,
you're not supposed
to go to those things.

292
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,075
You're not an alcoholic.

293
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,119
Only because I've
never had a drink.

294
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,331
What?
They are inspiring.

295
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,996
There is this one story
I've just got to tell you.
Sit down.

296
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,453
Okay.

297
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,954
This gentleman

298
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,211
who started
blow-jobbing to get crack.
His name is Marvin Johnson...

299
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,087
Mom, anonymous.
You keep... It's no names.
Okay, okay.

300
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,422
Forget it.
Marvin J. Whatever.

301
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,091
Too late.
Well, he became
a gay prostitute.

302
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,472
And he realized that
he had hit his bottom.

303
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,101
And I have been thinking,
honey,

304
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,058
that maybe this
is your bottom.

305
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,979
I'm telling you,
hitting bottom
is a good thing.

306
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,691
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

307
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,195
Right?
Yep. That's what you say.

308
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,531
Yeah, a positive message.
Yeah.

309
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,659
Yeah. Thanks for
the pep talk, Mom.

310
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,831
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

311
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,659
All right. I guess I'm
going to Lillian's party
by myself, then.

312
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,044
Don't talk to me
about being by yourself.

313
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,456
I go everywhere
by myself.

314
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,086
Thanks to that
new whore, Barb.

315
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,964
Mom, come on.
No, I don't like to say it.

316
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,885
They've been
married 12 years.

317
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,801
Okay.
But she's still a whore.

318
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,384
I'm sure she greets
him in the evening,
beaver first.

319
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,143
I don't want to
think about that.

320
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,807
I bet she got that car
by giving your dad
something sexually.

321
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,813
'Cause there was
one thing I would
never do,

322
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,315
and I'm sure Barb
is a champion at it.

323
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,611
I don't want to know.

324
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,527
It's called
a "chicken coop."
Of course it is.

325
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,483
You start at the back
and you peck your way

326
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,988
to the front like
you have a beak.

327
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,321
And then you end up
with two eggs
in your mouth.

328
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,164
That's gross.

329
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,867
Well, I'm sure
your dad likes it.

330
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,248
Of course,
he grew up on a farm.

331
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,329
Okay.

332
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,672
You sure you don't
want to move in with me?

333
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,214
Mom, thanks,
but no way.

334
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,761
No way in hell.
Yeah?

335
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
No, thanks.

336
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,343
Think about it.
Okay.

337
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,548
You don't need
your own place.

338
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, I Kind of do.
Okay.

339
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,010
All right,
I'm going to go.
All right.

340
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,454
Holy shit.

341
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,129
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.

342
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,593
Sorry.
Needs a wash.

343
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,807
You have to
punch it a few times.

344
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,904
Annie!

345
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,819
Oh, my God!

346
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,830
Oh, my God,
Lillian.
I know.

347
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,991
This is your
engagement party.
Isn't that crazy?

348
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,747
It's so beautiful.

349
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,828
I can't believe
Dougie's boss
is a member here.

350
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,503
I know,
and his parents, too.
And Dougie, I guess.

351
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,792
Gosh, and me,
I guess, too, now.

352
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,803
Come on, let's go
say hi to the rest
of the bridal party!

353
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,507
You remember
my cousin Rita?

354
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,633
Rita.
Annie.

355
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,517
I haven't seen you
since you
graduated high school.

356
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,888
She has
three kids now.

357
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,108
- Three boys.
- They're so cute.

358
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,857
They are cute,
but when they
reach that age,

359
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,312
they are disgusting.

360
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,318
They smell,
they are sticky,

361
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,483
they say things
that are horrible,

362
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,615
and there is semen all
over everything, okay?

363
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,286
Disgusting.

364
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,455
I cracked
a blanket in half.

365
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,283
Do you get where
I'm going with that?
I do.

366
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,583
I cracked it
in half.

367
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,918
What?

368
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,630
Annie,
this is Becca,
my friend from work.

369
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,706
We are in
the trenches together.

370
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,961
Hey. it's great
to meet you.
Hey, how are you?

371
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,296
Nice to meet you.

372
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,543
This is my husband,
Kevin.

373
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,844
Hi.
"Husband."

374
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,136
I like to say it.
We are newlyweds.

375
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,468
Wow. Congratulations.

376
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,723
Thank you so much.

377
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,430
We went on
a sweetheart honeymoon.
Oh.

378
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,766
Where did you guys go?

379
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,222
Disney World.
Disney World.

380
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,682
We finish each
ether's sentences.
Sorry.

381
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,438
Sorry.
Is this your husband?

382
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,191
No, no, no, no, no.

383
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,992
I don't know him.
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,821
Do you want to go
for a walk later?

385
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,538
Oh. I can't.

386
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,829
All right.
I can't. I'm sorry.

387
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,205
I'm so sorry.

388
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,378
I'm not with anybody.
I'm here solo.

389
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,419
Let's start it again.
I'm Becca.
Rewind.

390
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,503
This is my husband.
You don't have a husband.

391
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,587
Sorry.

392
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,515
And this is
Dougie's sister, Megan.

393
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,682
- Hey.
- Hi.

394
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,262
My grandma is not
supposed to have wine.
I'll be right back.

395
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,270
Hey.
Hey. How is it going?

396
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,319
It's going great.
It's going great.
I'm on the mend.

397
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,237
I just got some
pins in my legs.

398
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,450
Believe it or not,
pins in my legs,
I can still do this. Right?

399
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,948
I fell off a cruise ship,
but I'm back.

400
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,620
Oh, shit.
Yeah, "Oh, shit."

401
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,368
Yeah, "Oh, shit."

402
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,877
Took a hard,
hard, violent fall.
Kind of pin balled down.

403
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,171
Hit a lot of railings,
broke a lot of shit.

404
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,295
I'm not going to
say I survived,
I'm going to say I thrived.

405
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,380
I met a dolphin down there.

406
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,680
And I swear to God,
that dolphin looked
not at me,

407
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,971
but into my soul.

408
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,720
Into my goddamn soul, Annie.

409
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,476
And he said,
"I'm saving you, Megan."

410
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,140
Not with his mouth,
but he said it,
I'm assuming, telepathically

411
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,858
We had a connection
that I don't even
know if I can... Jesus.

412
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,487
Hey, shut my mouth.
Look at... Unbelievable.

413
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,738
You must be Annie's fella.

414
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,036
I'm Megan.
It's a pleasure.

415
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,202
He's not...
I'm not... He's not...
I'm not with him.

416
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,744
Sorry.
All right.

417
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm glad he's single,
because I'm going to
climb that like a tree.

418
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,165
Okay. You have
to meet Helen.

419
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,921
There she is. Helen.

420
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,055
Come here!

421
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,269
Helen, this is Annie.

422
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,345
Hi!
Ohh!

423
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,308
There she is.
Maid of honor.

424
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,519
So lovely to meet
Lillian's childhood friend.

425
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,401
You are so pretty.

426
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,525
You are so cute!
You are so sweet.

427
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,576
Helen is married
to Dougie's boss,
Mr. Harris. Perry.

428
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,531
Perry. And they
are so close now,

429
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,367
they are literally
joined at the hip.

430
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,202
Which is good,
because so are we.

431
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,505
I know.
I'm so glad you guys
are finally meeting.

432
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,582
I know. Me, too.
I know. it's lovely.

433
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,419
Well, excuse me,
I better go check on
the hors d'oeuvres.

434
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,254
But it was great
to finally meet you.

435
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,047
It's a great party.

436
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,427
- Enjoy.
- Bye.

437
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,884
- Bye.
- Bye.

438
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,267
She's great, isn't she?

439
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,973
She's awesome.

440
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,693
And I really
look forward to having
Doug as part of our family.

441
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,984
So much so
that you two should
get married right now

442
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,531
and save me
a shitload of money.

443
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,282
Dad.

444
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,203
Everybody always
laughs at that,
but I'm not joking.

445
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,619
I'm not joking.

446
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,329
Anyway, I want
to thank all of you
for coming.

447
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,381
And here's to Doug and
my baby girl, Lillian.

448
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,421
Cheers!
Cheers!

449
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,047
- I love you, Dad.
- Enough of me.

450
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,844
Let's get the maid
of honor up here.

451
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,010
All right.
Annie?

452
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,722
Umm. Hi.
I'm Annie Walker.

453
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,182
Yay, Annie!

454
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,686
I'm not going to go
on with a big speech,
so I'll just say this.

455
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,231
I'm so happy to be
a part of this celebration.

456
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,190
And you two
deserve each other,

457
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,234
as well as
a lifetime of happiness.

458
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,660
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

459
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,453
- Love you guys.
- Cheers.

460
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,993
Thanks, Annie.
Cheers.

461
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,119
Thank you, Annie.
That was so sweet.
Thank you.

462
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,416
Lil, remember that trip
we took to
Miami with the boys?

463
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,209
And they were
working the entire weekend,

464
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,887
and we just sat
and drank wine
and ate peanut brittle.

465
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,887
And I shared things with you
that I've never
shared with anyone.

466
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,188
And you made me realize
how I can trust people again.

467
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,227
So let me just say,

468
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,568
Lillian,
you are my best friend.

469
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,612
And I'm
so proud of you.

470
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,159
Sorry. And, Dougly...

471
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,324
I'm sorry, inside joke.

472
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,204
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash

473
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,160
because I still
need my drunken
Saturday nights

474
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,416
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

475
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,552
Everybody raise your glasses
to the couple of the decade,

476
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,504
Doug and Lillian.

477
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,308
Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.

478
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,936
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.

479
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,100
Umm...

480
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,525
I just wanted to
say really quick that

481
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,108
you are so special
to me, because...

482
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,161
Well, one of the reasons is
because I've known you
my whole entire life.

483
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,245
And you've really
helped shape who I am.

484
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,661
I just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me

485
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,496
as your maid of honor.

486
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,458
I know you had
some other choices,

487
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,965
but you are like my sister,
and I love you.

488
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,797
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

489
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,882
Thank you.
One last thing.

490
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,266
It's rare to meet
someone as an adult
who you really connect with,

491
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,470
and that's you, Lil.

492
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,182
I went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,

493
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,643
and there is
a beautiful saying
that I learned there.

494
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,570
It means,
"You are a part of me,

495
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,155
"a part that I could
never live without,

496
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:54,085
"and I hope and I pray
that I never have to."

497
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,384
And that's it for tonight.
Thank you for coming.

498
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,676
Really quick,
Thank you all for coming.

499
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,379
I just wanted to
say really quick...

500
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,131
Dessert wine is out.
Consuelo?

501
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,591
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,

502
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,975
Lillian and I took
Spanish together in school.

503
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,895
And so, I would just
like to say to you,
and to everyone here...

504
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,790
Thank you.

505
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,752
Thank you.
I feel so close to you
and can trust you.

506
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,132
You are my
angel and soul mate.

507
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,388
And I feel I can
communicate with you
with simply a look.

508
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,312
Thank you for coming.

509
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,811
Here, I'll take that.
I'll take that.

510
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,939
Yep, I got it.

511
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,026
Lillian...

512
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,785
Keep smiling, keep shining

513
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:21,088
Knowing you can
always count on me

514
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,293
For sure

515
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,126
That's what friends are for

516
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,713
In good times and bad times

517
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:34,678
I'll be on your
side forever more

518
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,478
That's what friends are for

519
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,347
That's what
friends are for

520
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,617
Man,
engagement parties rule.

521
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,664
It made me feel awesome,

522
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,458
like I can go out
and catch another
dude to marry.

523
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,290
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?

524
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,626
What?
I'm just like...

525
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,461
I don't know.
She's in your wedding

526
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,717
and you've only
known her eight months,
though, right?

527
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,715
Come on.
Get it out,
get it all out.

528
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,555
I'm just...
Like, the whole gown,
and the...thing.

529
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,480
It's just weird, right?
You know what?

530
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,900
She's actually
really cool, Annie.

531
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,319
She's really...
She's a good one.
I'm telling you.

532
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,773
Well, I'm sure if you
like her, I will like her.

533
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,321
You have to just
get to know her.

534
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,198
Yeah.
Which I think
you really should.

535
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,120
And... Will you
just do me a favor?

536
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,697
Would you just hang
out with her once,

537
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,324
just the two of you.
All right?

538
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,000
As a favor to me.

539
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,247
Okay, I will.

540
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,503
I love you, Annie Lou.
I love you, too.

541
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,626
Bye.
Bye.

542
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,041
Oh. Hi, I'm Helen.

543
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,923
You live in Milwaukee?
I'm sorry.

544
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,547
Have you met Lillian?
She's my best friend.

545
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,506
Yeah, I know.
We've only known each other
for five minutes.

546
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,841
Oh! Oh!

547
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,807
on! Cute.

548
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,318
No. No. Come on.

549
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,195
See? Okay?
I'm not drunk. I told you.

550
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,450
So, you are just
a terrible sober driver?

551
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,831
Ha ha. Very funny.
Can I stop walking now?

552
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,830
You can stop walking
when I tell you
to stop walking.

553
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,331
Hey, look.
If I was drunk,

554
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,083
would I be able to do this?

555
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,058
Stop it. Stop it.
Please, stop.

556
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,893
Please, stop.
I believe you.
You are not drunk.

557
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,729
But I'm still gonna
have to give you a ticket.

558
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,321
What? why?

559
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,491
It's a funny thing
about brake lights.
You have to have them.

560
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,615
I knew it.
God, those have
been out for a year.

561
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,405
I'm so stupid.

562
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,740
Look, please.

563
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,117
Please, I promise
I will get them fixed.

564
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,914
This week, I promise.
Please. Do you have
to give me a ticket?

565
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,422
Yes. License
and registration,
please.

566
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,058
Thanks.

567
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,181
Look at that,
you live on
Wynnewood Drive.

568
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,641
Yep.
We are neighbors.

569
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,227
I just live
over on Ashley.
Ahh.

570
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,567
I used to work on Ashley.

571
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,819
You did? Where?

572
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,745
I had a bakery
on the main part
of the street there.

573
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,827
Oh. Cake Baby.

574
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,660
You are Cake Baby!
Yeah!

575
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,754
Yeah, you had your sign.
It was your face.

576
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,669
Yeah!
That was you?

577
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,795
That was me.

578
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,169
You made good cakes.

579
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:57,963
Thanks.

580
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,175
You used to make these
little pastry things,

581
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,013
and you'd put
something in them,
like a cream or a custard...

582
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,430
Cream puffs.

583
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,811
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them.
Delicious.

584
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,528
I used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,

585
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,150
with, like, a wormy face.

586
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,945
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

587
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,487
Sorry.
No, no. It was...

588
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,870
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me

589
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,578
when the business
went under. So, anyway...

590
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,207
You're kidding?

591
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,960
What a dick.

592
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,134
I'm glad
I never tipped him.

593
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,632
You know what?
Let's forget about this.

594
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,427
Let's just
forget this one.
Really?

595
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,137
Under one condition.
What? What?

596
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,346
Get your
taillights fixed...

597
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,307
I promise.
I promise I will.
I promise. Thank you.

598
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,516
...Before you kill someone.

599
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,775
I'm not going to
kill anybody.

600
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,353
All right.
Here, there's your ID.

601
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,946
And I'm going
to give you this.

602
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,615
It's a buddy of mine.
He has a body
shop in Milwaukee.

603
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,408
He'll fix those
right up for you.

604
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,866
Bill Cozbi?

605
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,408
Yeah, with a "Z."

606
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,657
Different guy.
Yeah.

607
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,118
And don't mention
the whole "Bill
Cosby" thing to him.

608
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,624
It drives him nuts.
I mean it.

609
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,047
Okay, I get it. Thanks.

610
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,966
You know what?
If you mention my name,
that I referred you,

611
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,840
he'll give you
a particularly
good deal.

612
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,092
My gosh. Thank you.

613
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,390
I really appreciate it.
Thanks.

614
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,093
Okay. Well,
I appreciated your cakes.

615
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,974
So, we are even.

616
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,181
That's me, there.
Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

617
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,435
That's really
nice of you.

618
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,320
Thank you.

619
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,898
We are not all bad.

620
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,232
What?

621
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,737
I was just saying,
we are not all bad!

622
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,364
Oh. Yeah.

623
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,162
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.

624
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm the best of them.

625
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,161
Okay. Thank you.

626
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,080
Anyway.

627
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
Thank you.

628
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,647
I didn't know
you played tennis.

629
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,653
Yeah, I played
a little in
high school.

630
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,530
I'm so glad we
were able to do this.

631
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,995
I'm really glad we
could do this, too.
It's nice we get to hang out.

632
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,287
I know, right?
Yeah.

633
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,286
It's too bad
Lillian couldn't play
with us today.

634
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,537
Poor thing, she is so busy.

635
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,875
Ohh. I know.

636
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,662
But she's not really
that into sports.

637
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,292
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything

638
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,749
that was too competitive.

639
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,839
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.

640
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,670
It's funny how
people change, isn't it?

641
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,049
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
Do people really change?

642
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,721
I think they do.

643
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,062
Yeah, but, I mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

644
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,731
I think we change
all the time.

645
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,277
I think we stay the same,
but grow,
I guess, a little bit.

646
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,814
I think if you are growing,
then you are changing.

647
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,241
But, I mean, we are changing
from who we are,
which we always stay as.

648
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,863
Not really,
I don't think so.

649
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,578
I think so.
I don't.

650
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,323
Annie! These are my kids.

651
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,249
Step-kids.
Step.

652
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,457
They are so hilarious.

653
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,670
Funny.

654
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,498
Excuse me,
my husband's kids.

655
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,999
What are
you guys up to?

656
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,251
Going to the snack bar.

657
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,257
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?

658
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,971
Fuck off, Helen.

659
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,596
Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.

660
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,390
Good to see you.

661
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,516
They are so cute.

662
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,729
Sweet kids.

663
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,971
Carol!

664
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,803
Get your shit together, Carol!

665
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,737
Yes!

666
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,701
I've seen better
tennis playing in
a tampon commercial.

667
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
Umm...

668
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,535
I've been thinking, and...

669
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,413
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.

670
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,793
She's been here
long enough.

671
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,842
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for
me to be paying half.

672
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,469
We split it three ways.
What do you say?

673
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,047
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.

674
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,758
Yeah. So, technically,
I'm only allowed to tour.

675
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,184
Well, you know...

676
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,598
I have no way
of earning money,

677
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,306
unless I just
go and prostitute
down on the street.

678
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,141
I don't want you
to do that, no.

679
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,983
"Hello, fellas.
Here I am."

680
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,481
Yeah, but we...
"Put your American sausage

681
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,062
"in my English McMuffin."

682
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,271
No, we did that.
All right.

683
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,699
Okay, I don't even know
what you're
talking about any more.

684
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,651
There's three
people living here.
Yeah.

685
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,657
If she doesn't
start paying...

686
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,862
I'm not.
...she has to leave.

687
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,743
Is this about
the diary again?

688
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,915
What diary?

689
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,876
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.

690
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,996
You read my...
You read my journal?

691
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,299
At first, I did not know
that it was your diary.

692
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,423
I thought it was
a very sad,
hand-written book.

693
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,385
What? That does not
make any...

694
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,174
But, because of
the deep personal details

695
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,767
and the bits that
mentioned Gil and Brynn...
No, no, no, no.

696
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,557
- Don't read my journal!
- And the crumbs.

697
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,888
Then...
Don't go in my room!

698
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,101
Well, hello! I think,
before you make
those sort of demands,

699
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,526
you need to,
maybe, think about

700
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,986
putting a note on
your door saying,

701
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,361
"Do not come into my room,
read my diary and
wear my clothes."

702
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,415
Wow, I've never been
to this part of town before.

703
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,913
Look, you can get
your checks cashed
next door.

704
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,465
I know it looks
a little scary
on the outside,

705
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,884
but the food
is really good,
authentic Brazilian.

706
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,421
I'm telling you,
this is where
Brazilians come to eat.

707
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,846
I got to say, Annie's
really good at this.

708
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,594
She always drags me
to the weirdest places

709
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,430
and the food is
always incredible.

710
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,387
And plus, you get
a lot for your money, too.
So that's good.

711
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,852
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

712
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,899
Whoa! Somebody
likes Brazilian food.

713
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,480
To my bridesmaids.

714
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,362
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

715
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,534
Cheers to Lil!

716
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,615
This is such a stone-cold
pack of weirdos,
and I'm so proud.

717
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,950
And I just want to toast
all of you ladies.

718
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,626
I'm so happy to
get to know you guys,

719
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,625
and happy to say
that I have four
new friends.

720
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,501
Absolutely. Cheers.

721
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,548
So, Annie,
do you have a date
for the wedding?

722
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,669
Um...

723
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,432
I don't... I don't think
I'm bringing anybody,
I guess.

724
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,802
Please, can I
set you up? Please?

725
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,354
Annie, you can't go
to the wedding alone.
Please?

726
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,602
If you go alone,
people might think
you're a prostitute.

727
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,853
Maybe.

728
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,273
I'm sorry.

729
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:39,030
I hope that you're all hungry
for churrasco Brasil.
What would you like?

730
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,656
Yeah, I'll have
some of that, please.

731
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,827
I'll start with this.

732
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,406
I'd say yes.
Hello, chicken.

733
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,287
This is crazy
good, ya'll.

734
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,243
Helen, aren't you
eating any meat?

735
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,751
It's not good
to eat a big meal
before a fitting.

736
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,174
I feel a bit
bloated, so...

737
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,296
Not me.

738
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,594
No?
No. Physically,
I don't bloat.

739
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,846
Lucky.
That is lucky.

740
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,927
It's a gift.

741
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,765
I can't wait to be married
for as long as you've been
married.

742
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,016
And to have kids.

743
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,850
And be a mom.
Becca?

744
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,027
Yeah?

745
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,275
The other night,
I'm slaving away,

746
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,482
making a beautiful
dinner for my family.

747
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,947
My youngest boy
comes in and says
he wants to order a pizza.

748
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,866
I said, "No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight."

749
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,448
He goes,
"Mom, why don't you go
and fuck yourself?"

750
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,291
He's nine.

751
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,461
Okay, now that
Lillian's in the bathroom,

752
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,914
I just wanted to
talk to you guys about
the shower really quick.

753
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,422
I was thinking it
could be French-themed,

754
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,049
since she's always wanted
to go to Paris her whole life.

755
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,049
So I figured we
could bring Paris here

756
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,219
and have champagne
and little cookies.

757
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,804
They'd say "Lillian
and Dougie" on them.

758
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,475
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

759
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,229
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

760
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,102
I love that.
Good idea, Annie.

761
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,186
We can have
French invitations,
the whole thing.

762
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,396
Don't you think
that'd be nice?

763
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,481
That's adorable!
That's really cute.

764
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,238
Good. Great.

765
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,990
I don't know.
It's really cute.

766
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,070
But I feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's

767
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,239
a bit,
"Been there, done that."

768
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,703
I just feel
like we can top it.

769
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,159
We should throw
some ideas around.

770
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,461
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind

771
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,083
or something
they'd been thinking of.

772
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,415
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?

773
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,422
And we all come dressed
as our favorite
Pixar character.

774
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,886
That, and I'll just
snowball on top of that,
also Fight Club.

775
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,596
Female fight club.

776
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,683
We grease up,
we pull in.

777
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,437
Lillian doesn't know,
so it's, "Surprise!
We're going to fight!"

778
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,192
We beat the shit out of her.

779
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,569
She's not going
to forget that.

780
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,688
We just fucking attack.

781
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,945
Can I be honest?
No.

782
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,198
I'm at home with
three boys all day,
every day.

783
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,620
What about
the bachelorette party?

784
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,118
That's what's more important.

785
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,703
I've got a new tube top,
I want to cut the tags off.

786
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,751
I'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.

787
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,041
Where are we going?
I'm going
to second her.

788
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,747
We'd better
blow this shit out.
Yeah.

789
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,504
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

790
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,961
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.

791
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,129
Because she's realizing,
"Holy shit!

792
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,965
"I've got to spend
the rest of my life
with Doug."

793
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,222
He's my brother. I love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.

794
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,019
I think we can all
agree on that, right?

795
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,439
We can...
We'll figure it out.

796
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,984
I mean, I can think of stuff,
and it will be great.

797
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,312
We just have to make sure
it's really, really special.

798
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,903
Belle en Blanc?
This is the place.
Great job, Annie.

799
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,659
Thanks.
Annie.

800
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,121
Belle en Blanc.
Reservation name?

801
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,080
I don't have one.
We're just here to shop,
just to try on some dresses.

802
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,835
Okay. Well, the next
available appointment

803
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,583
for bridesmaids'
fittings is in seven weeks.

804
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,509
Absolutely no walk-ins.

805
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,424
Whitney? It's Helen.

806
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,179
Helen Harris?
Yeah!

807
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,302
Hi!
Hi.

808
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,258
Oh, my God. Hi. Listen,
I'll buzz you right in.

809
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,184
Great, thanks.
Okay.

810
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,022
Hello. Welcome, come in.

811
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,223
You look wonderful.
Great to see you.

812
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,274
Welcome to Belle
en Blanc, ladies.

813
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,102
- Welcome to heaven.
- Thank you.

814
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,528
Oh, man!

815
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,528
This is some
classy shit here.

816
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,280
Jesus, Megan!

817
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,861
I'm sorry,
I want to apologize.

818
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,244
I'm not even confident
on which end that came out of.

819
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,370
Whitney, back to you.
I'm sorry.

820
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,545
Anyway, take a look around.
Get to know the dresses.

821
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,338
If you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

822
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,922
Have fun.

823
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,842
Oh, my God.

824
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,715
It's a Fritz Bernaise.

825
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:27,962
Ladies, I...
Oh, my God!

826
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,469
I just don't think
we can do any better.
This is...

827
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,471
This is beautiful.
That is gorgeous.

828
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,302
It's unique,
it's special, it's couture.

829
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,103
This is made in France.

830
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,972
Helen, this is $800.

831
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,899
Are you kidding?
It's on sale.

832
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,064
Are you serious?
Oh, my gosh.
What a perfect combination.

833
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,565
You guys,
it was meant to be.

834
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,066
Oh. that's nice.

835
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,283
There's other dresses
we should be looking at.

836
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,076
Nope, not that one.

837
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,705
Lillian,
Lillian, look at this one.

838
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,328
Isn't this pretty?
Yeah.

839
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,626
It's really pretty
and sweet, and...

840
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,877
We don't want to
upstage Lillian
with a big fancy dress.

841
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,548
Maybe we should
just get something
kind of simple.

842
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,666
Oh.

843
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,217
Please do not worry
about upstaging me.

844
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,299
Because guess who
Helen is friends with

845
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,472
and who's
designing my wedding dress.

846
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,350
Lady St. Petsois JuJu.

847
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,228
I just sent my
measurements to France, y'all.

848
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,272
No, you didn't.

849
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,853
Where were you when I
was getting married?

850
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,031
Ladies, let's not decide
on this bridesmaids'
dress straight away.

851
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,449
Let's let
our bodies decide.

852
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,118
Try some things on
and have some fun, okay?

853
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,408
Yeah, let's have
some fun, girls.

854
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,452
Ladies,
start your "engines."

855
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,700
- Oh, yeah.
- Lil, Lil.

856
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,627
- Amazing.
- This is so cool.

857
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,053
Ladies. Ladies,
if I may interject.

858
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,555
I just want to say
you all look stunning.

859
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,390
That's a given. Head to toe.

860
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,473
But, sadly,
we need to agree on one.

861
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,934
Well, I mean, ladies,
you all look beautiful.

862
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,646
But I just think,
personally, the
Fritz Bernaise is just...

863
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,071
I mean...
it's a Bernaise.

864
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,570
This is
one of a kind.
I just...

865
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,650
I don't think
there is a question.

866
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,776
No. No question.

867
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,154
There might be a question.

868
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,080
I might...
I might have a question.

869
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,954
I think this
dress would look great
on everybody.

870
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,126
It's a great color.
It's a great length.

871
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,670
It's fun. You can twirl.

872
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,793
You can move in it.

873
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,591
You can spread
your legs apart.

874
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,010
And it's a great price.

875
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,838
This is designer as well.

876
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,469
Is anyone else hot?

877
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,842
It is like an
oven in here.

878
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,094
Okay, well,
maybe this might
help you decide.

879
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,930
While you gals were
in the changing room,

880
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,393
I happened to rustle up
a two-year-old Lady
JuJu dress in storage.

881
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,193
I had Lillian put it
on so you could see

882
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,984
what you'll be
standing next to.

883
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,530
Lillian, honey.

884
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,279
My God.

885
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,869
Beautiful length.

886
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,405
Breathtaking.

887
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,208
Holy shit!
You look amazing.

888
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,793
That's a dress.
That dress is so pretty

889
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,869
it makes my stomach hurt.

890
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,714
Lillian,

891
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,467
- I don't know what to say.
- You look...

892
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,633
Megan, are you okay?

893
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,888
I think...

894
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,179
My dress was
probably just tight.

895
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,605
Oh, my God.

896
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,978
You got food poisoning
from that restaurant,
didn't you?

897
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,566
No, I had the same thing
that she had and I feel fine.

898
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,230
Oh, my... Okay.
Oh, no.

899
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,940
Why is this happening?
Nothing is happening.

900
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,408
Oh, my God.

901
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,824
I don't really care
which dress we get.

902
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,997
It doesn't matter to me.
I just need to get
off this white carpet.

903
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,494
Oh, God.
Okay. No,
not the bathroom.

904
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,326
Everybody go outside.
I'm serious!

905
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,332
There is a bathroom
across the street.

906
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,757
I think everybody
has the flu.

907
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,510
Shit!

908
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,052
I need the toilet!
I need the toilet!

909
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,806
I need the toilet!

910
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,387
No!

911
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,182
No. No, Megan.
No! No!

912
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,939
Look away!
Megan, no!

913
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,151
Look away!

914
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,781
You don't look
very well, Annie.

915
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:20,991
I feel fine.

916
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,200
Are you sure?
It wasn't that
gray kind of lamb?

917
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,035
You ate a lot of
that weird chicken.

918
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,998
Was it that?

919
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,373
No. I'm...

920
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,627
I... I feel fine.

921
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,590
I think you'd just feel
better if you threw up.

922
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,639
I don't have...
I don't have to throw up.

923
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,348
I am so sorry.

924
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,428
Get away from me!

925
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,392
You're not sick?

926
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,472
No.
No?

927
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,651
In fact, Helen, I'm hungry.

928
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,899
And I wish I had a snack.

929
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,150
You're hungry?

930
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,615
I'm starving.

931
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,158
What did we eat?

932
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,408
The sink is a goner.
What are you doing?

933
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,160
It's coming out
of me like lava!

934
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,409
Oh, my God.

935
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,910
Don't you
fucking look at me!

936
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,330
Hmm?

937
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,831
Jordan almonds.

938
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,249
These are great.

939
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,343
Thank you.

940
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,062
Better?

941
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,519
I was...
I was just hungry.

942
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,892
Yeah.

943
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,563
Annie, everybody
is really sick
from that restaurant.

944
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,907
But it wasn't
the restaurant.
No, no, no, no.

945
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,404
Lillian,
where are you going?
No.

946
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,531
I need a bathroom.

947
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,574
Lil!

948
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,620
No. No.

949
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,788
Lil, where are you going?

950
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,538
Be careful.
What are you doing?

951
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,038
It's happening.
It's happening.

952
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,926
- It happened.
- What are you doing?

953
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,378
It happened.

954
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,094
No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!

955
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,596
Ohh. You're really
doing it, aren't you?

956
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,310
You're really
shitting in the street.

957
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,398
We'll just take five
of the Fritz Bernaises.

958
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,108
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.

959
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,864
Right.
Thank you.

960
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,331
You okay?

961
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,332
I crapped
my wedding dress.
I crapped...

962
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,133
I... I crapped
my wedding dress.

963
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,261
Lunch was fun,
though, right?

964
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,006
It was a good time,
all the girls together.

965
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,012
Is this a sign, Annie?

966
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,433
No. I'm just
going to pull over

967
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,307
really quick,
though, because...

968
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,387
What?

969
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,596
...My tire just
feels a little...

970
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,772
Where are you going?

971
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:54,940
My tire just feels
a little low.

972
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,938
I just want to check
my tire real quick.

973
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,718
Oh. Could I borrow
your razor, please?

974
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,178
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

975
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,603
Have a good date.
Thank you.

976
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,021
Is the guy that
you're going out
with also over 40?

977
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,064
I'm not over 40.
Forget it.

978
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,820
Lift up your arm.
Point up.

979
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,366
Ow!
Sorry.

980
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,453
Hi.
Annie.

981
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,247
Pete?
Yeah.

982
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,372
Come on in.

983
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,457
All right. Thank you.

984
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,846
Oh. This is
my son, Tyler.

985
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,006
Hi, Tyler.
Hi.

986
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,847
These things are
always so awkward.
Yeah.

987
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,803
I'm not really a setup guy.
Me, either.

988
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,433
But Becca spoke
so highly of you.

989
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,270
She had a lot of
really nice things
to say about you, too.

990
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,441
That's nice to hear.

991
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,228
I'm going to go upstairs,
throw on a couple
of finishing touches.

992
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:26,156
The babysitter's not here yet,
so just hang out with Tyler

993
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,490
and I'll be
right back down.
Okay.

994
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,567
Okay.

995
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,501
So, how old are you?

996
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,386
Do you watch movies?

997
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,811
Are you afraid of dying?

998
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,887
Hmm?

999
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,224
Are you afraid of dying?

1000
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:00,975
Um...

1001
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,145
I don't know.

1002
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,987
I mean,
I guess everybody is.
I don't know. Why?

1003
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,119
Because my mom is
going to kill you.

1004
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,833
You're making me
uncomfortable.

1005
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,594
Your hair looks burned.

1006
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,801
Okay.

1007
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,644
Are you going to make
a baby with my father?

1008
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,602
I don't...
I don't know.

1009
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,901
My grandma died
where you're sitting.

1010
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,657
She died right here?

1011
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,328
Right where your
underpants are.

1012
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,667
You wanna
watch me dance?

1013
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,206
Sure.

1014
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,396
I can't do this.

1015
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,903
Listen to me.
I miss you so much.

1016
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,155
I'll come over right now.

1017
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,362
Okay, I'm not over
you yet, that's why.

1018
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,072
She's not even pretty.

1019
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,450
I'm not doing it.
I can't. No.

1020
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,673
What are you doing?
Did you eat one of those?

1021
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,846
Did you eat
one of those?

1022
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,639
I ate Saturday.

1023
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,096
Okay. Oh, boy.
You know what?

1024
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,803
Something's going
to happen to you.
I don't know what it is,

1025
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,765
but something's
going to happen
to your body.

1026
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,153
That was fun.
Oh, my gosh.

1027
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:15,572
You know what I was thinking?

1028
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,404
You should come with me
to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

1029
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,830
Not like that.
Not like anything serious.

1030
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,749
But just like
a fun time, you know?

1031
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:27,422
We can get dressed up,
and we can go
dancing and have a drink.

1032
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,793
It'll be fun, right?

1033
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,175
No. I mean,
I don't want to make
you have to explain

1034
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,050
to all those people
what our relationship is.

1035
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,966
That would suck for you.
Right?

1036
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,268
Yeah. I guess so.

1037
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,262
I'm just thinking of you.
Yeah.

1038
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,939
No, it's okay.

1039
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,314
I have someone else
I can ask, anyway. So...

1040
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,358
Really?
Yeah.

1041
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,655
Who?

1042
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,024
Umm...
This guy, George.

1043
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,281
George Glass.

1044
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,747
Okay.

1045
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,827
Who is this George?

1046
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:11,461
He is a very hot, nice guy

1047
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,044
who likes me a lot,
and would probably
love to be my date.

1048
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,128
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

1049
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,212
Mmm-hmm.

1050
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,144
Well, let me ask you this.

1051
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,099
Can this George Glass

1052
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,061
do this to you?

1053
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,248
Probably.

1054
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,831
You know what?
It's getting really late.

1055
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,380
You should probably go.
I'm going to miss you so much.

1056
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,434
Oh.

1057
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:16,605
Annie Walker.

1058
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,773
Hi.

1059
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,108
Hey.
Hey.

1060
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,611
What brings you
in here so early?

1061
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,788
I've just had a bad night.
Boy stuff.
Ohh.

1062
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,541
Do you want me
to arrest anybody?

1063
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,617
I could do that.

1064
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,743
Actually... No.

1065
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,206
Do you want to talk
to a cop about it?
We are just like priests.

1066
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,001
Except we can
tell everybody
about it after wards.

1067
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,131
Oh.
I won't, though.

1068
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:39,844
Doesn't sound very inviting.

1069
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,635
You want a carrot?

1070
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,888
Right now?
Yeah.

1071
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,641
I'll share.
I've got plenty.

1072
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,764
Sure, I'll have a carrot.

1073
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,981
Yeah?

1074
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,309
Okay.

1075
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,944
Ohh. Yeah,
that sounds rough.

1076
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,363
It's going to
get better, right?

1077
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,439
I wouldn't have
thought so.

1078
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,572
You know, my sister
was a maid of honor
at our cousin's wedding,

1079
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,246
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.

1080
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,240
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1081
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,451
It grew back,
but it was...

1082
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,453
It was pretty gross.

1083
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,338
Planning a wedding
should be fun.

1084
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,087
You know what?
If I ever had a wedding,

1085
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,881
I'd want everybody
to be stress-free.

1086
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,678
I'd like it to be
like a carnival.

1087
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:26,225
Like, people win prizes
for guessing
the bride's weight.

1088
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,643
Dunk tanks.

1089
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,844
Yeah.
You know?

1090
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,603
Mmm-hmm.
You could have elephants,

1091
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,023
and the bride and groom
can walk on
a little tightrope.

1092
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,942
Okay, what you are
talking about there,
that's a circus wedding.

1093
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,645
It's a totally different...
Right.

1094
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,150
You missed it.
Yeah.

1095
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,117
Hey, you know,
instead of stressing
out about this wedding,

1096
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,785
you know what you
should be doing?

1097
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,829
Setting up a new bakery!

1098
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,656
Hmm.

1099
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,285
No, I'm kind of
done with that.

1100
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,957
What?

1101
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,497
I don't do it any more.

1102
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,173
All right.

1103
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,169
Ew.
Oh!

1104
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,762
You got the ugly carrot.
What?

1105
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,465
There is one in every bag.
You have to eat it.
It's good luck.

1106
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,674
I'm not eating this.

1107
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,891
Yeah! I'll eat it.

1108
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,395
It's the lucky carrot?
No, don't eat it!
Don't eat it. Don't eat it!

1109
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,563
Well, don't litter!
I'll fine you.
I'm sorry.

1110
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,606
You know what?
Actually,
I'm going to pick it up.

1111
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,982
It really bothers me.
Sorry.

1112
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:24,238
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm anal
about that kind of thing.

1113
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:32,750
I didn't know that
you could be a cop here
if you weren't a citizen.

1114
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,751
You can't.
No?

1115
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,669
No. No, you can't.

1116
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,668
But they made
a special dispensation

1117
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,712
because I'm so
tough and strong.

1118
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,259
Oh. Right.
And handsome.

1119
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,631
Okay.

1120
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,257
You're pretty...
You're pretty tough.

1121
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,344
I am tough.
You're tough.
You're a tough cop.

1122
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,595
Look. You're saying it,
but you're laughing.

1123
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,842
No, you're...
You're...

1124
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,143
You didn't let
me flex that time.

1125
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,477
That was unfair.
I'm really tough.

1126
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,522
So am I.
No.

1127
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,850
Yeah. I could be a cop.

1128
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,024
You think
you could be a cop?
Yeah.

1129
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,104
Okay.
Yeah.

1130
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,030
Let's see.
You know what?

1131
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,201
The sun is nearly up.
Let's go and see if
you've got what it takes.

1132
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,153
That's right.
Now, plant your feet.

1133
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,279
Okay.

1134
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,410
Good.

1135
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,533
And take aim.

1136
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,463
Now, put your left
hand behind your head.

1137
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,340
Yeah. And just
drop your left hip.

1138
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,005
I'm kidding. Put your
arms out straight.
Okay.

1139
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,340
You want to hit the middle
of the license plate.

1140
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,892
That's where you get
the most accurate reading.

1141
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,061
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?

1142
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,183
Okay.

1143
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,684
Fifty-eight.
What's the speed limit?

1144
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,983
Fifty-five.

1145
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,733
Okay, they were all right.
We'll let them go.

1146
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,440
You were born
to do this.
Look at you.

1147
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,734
Okay.
All right,
here we go.

1148
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,321
Sixty-three.

1149
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,164
You are missing
some good ones here.

1150
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,539
People are on
their way to work.
Why ruin their day?

1151
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,703
Okay, watch this. 48.

1152
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,497
Forty-eight.
How did you do that?

1153
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:03,753
It wasn't!
Yes, it was.

1154
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,254
That's never happened.
Are you serious?

1155
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,755
It was 48?
Yes, 48!

1156
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,508
Yeah.
I'm so impressed.

1157
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,759
I'm pretty impressive.

1158
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,806
I'm very impressed by you.

1159
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,675
Whoa!

1160
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,926
Whoa!

1161
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,603
Whoa!
Damn!

1162
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,559
That was 91.
91?

1163
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,639
Yes. Can we go?

1164
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,724
We can go.

1165
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,980
Come on, hot dogger.

1166
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,525
Let's get that fucker.

1167
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,860
ANNIE; on, my God!

1168
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,317
Oh, my God!

1169
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,838
...Family lake house. Perfect.

1170
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,679
Hello?
I just got your e-mail.
Lake house?

1171
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,143
Yeah.

1172
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,563
Yeah, it's
Lillian's parents' house.

1173
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,187
We used to go there
all the time in the
summers and everything.

1174
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,810
It's one oi..
A bachelorette in a cabin?

1175
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,316
Wait. Can you..4
Hold that thought. Hold on.

1176
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,442
Hello?

1177
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,857
Fucking Helen. Hello?

1178
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,818
Annie, it's Rita.

1179
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,152
Hi.

1180
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,490
Listen, I need a trip
that I can fantasize forever

1181
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,540
so that I am able to
have sex with my husband.

1182
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,752
That's why
I'm thinking Vegas.

1183
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,624
Vegas?

1184
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,704
Hang on. Hey!

1185
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,382
Shut your filth y
fucking mouths! I'm sorry.

1186
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,879
I'm surrounded by savages.

1187
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,920
You know what?
I should probably run.
My other line is ringing.

1188
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,256
You know, I can get cocaine
from my hairdresser.

1189
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,850
Okay, bye. Hello?

1190
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,222
Annie.
Yeah?

1191
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,438
I'm so excited.
Helen just called.
She said we can go to Vegas.

1192
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,524
You know...
Yeah, but we have to...
We have to fly there, and...

1193
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,773
Okay, Annie, I know
you are afraid of flying,

1194
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,857
but I want to see Criss Angel,
but I'm scared.

1195
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,983
Which I sort of love.

1196
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,693
Can you just hold on
for one second?

1197
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,995
Oh, sure, sure, sure. I...
Thanks. Hold on.
God damn it.

1198
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,122
Hello?
Hey, Annie, it's Megan.

1199
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,198
Hey.

1200
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,660
I just had some thoughts
about the bachelorette party.

1201
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,377
Okay, here we go.

1202
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,996
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.

1203
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,211
Helen called you,
didn't she?

1204
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,958
Yeah, she got the jump on you.

1205
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,424
I want balls in my face.

1206
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:14,839
Honestly, I think it's Vegas.

1207
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,886
I love puppets.
Balls.

1208
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,307
I guess we are undecided.

1209
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,336
I feel so bad Annie's
stuck back in coach.

1210
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,841
I know, I offered
to pay for her

1211
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,377
so she could sit
in first class,

1212
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,633
but she said no.

1213
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,838
She's too proud.

1214
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,515
It was nice of you to offer.

1215
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,393
No carry-on, huh?

1216
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,972
No.
Yeah, I noticed.

1217
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,433
I noticed you
didn't put anything
in the overhead bin either.

1218
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,516
And I get it.

1219
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,195
I get it. I want you to know,
protect and serve

1220
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,822
Air Marshal-style.

1221
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,482
What?

1222
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,567
I don't want to
infringe on your privacy, man.

1223
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,029
I just... I really appreciate
what you do for this country.

1224
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,447
And I respect
the hell out of you.

1225
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,624
That's great.

1226
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,416
I'm not an Air Marshal.
I'm going to take a nap.

1227
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,587
Awesome.
Cool.

1228
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,082
I'll take the first watch.

1229
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,885
I'm not an Air Marshal.
You don't need
to take a watch.

1230
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,178
Okay.

1231
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,257
I've got the first watch.

1232
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,804
Please check
your seat belts

1233
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,056
and that your seat backs
are in an upright
position before takeoff

1234
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,182
Gosh.

1235
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,686
I am really hoping
this flight is quick,

1236
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,809
and we get there on
the ground safely.

1237
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,984
I'm not a good flyer,
I'm sorry.

1238
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,231
I had a dream last
night that we went down.

1239
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,112
Yep. It was terrible.
You were in it.

1240
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,702
What?
It sounds like
something's happening.

1241
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,622
Annie, what are you
doing up here?

1242
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,123
You are supposed
to be in your seat.

1243
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,549
I know.
I'm freaking out
a little bit.

1244
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,468
Ma'am, we're still ascending.
You're gonna need to
return to your seat.

1245
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,879
Okay, I was just...

1246
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,966
Annie, I have something.

1247
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,718
Take two, you'll fall asleep,
wake up and we'll be there.
Here.

1248
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,767
Ma'am, you're going
to have to return to
your seat, please.

1249
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,440
It's fine.
Okay. All right.

1250
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,517
- Ma'am!
- All right. All right.

1251
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,981
Oh, my God, I feel terrible,
I should be sitting
back there with her.

1252
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,987
I shouldn't be up
here in first class.
I feel like such a jerk.

1253
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,989
Lil, this is
your weekend, okay?

1254
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,078
You are
treating yourself.
Just relax.

1255
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,826
She will be fine.
She will make friends.

1256
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,033
There is much more sense
of community in coach,
I promise you.

1257
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,208
She'll be fine.

1258
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,298
I can't believe
you've never been
with anybody else.

1259
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,379
Just Kevin.

1260
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,388
I'm sorry. I just...

1261
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,053
Becca, I just can't
help but feel bad for you.

1262
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,811
You don't even
know what you want.

1263
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,812
I got to know where
you keep the gun, man.

1264
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,433
I mean, is it ankle,
hip, lower back?

1265
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,268
You don't...
Between the cheeks, do you?

1266
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:20,358
No, I don't stick
a gun up my butt.
That's stupid.

1267
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,566
I didn't say "up."

1268
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,411
I just knew of a guy,
that guy did a lot
of undercover work.

1269
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:29,578
And all I know is
he had tape marks
all up and down his cheeks.

1270
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,580
That can't be true.

1271
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,954
People don't keep
guns up their asses

1272
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,506
because if you
needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

1273
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,086
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1274
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,092
What?
In his back pocket.

1275
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,799
You have got to get
something out of your ass

1276
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,926
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,

1277
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,882
you want to tell me
you can't get to something?

1278
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,598
I don't have a gun
for you to put up my ass
to make your point.

1279
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,805
I can put my Nano.
I will show you.

1280
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,310
I will...
If you get me scissors,

1281
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,853
I will cut
a hole in my pocket.

1282
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,230
And you will
never find this again
until I want you to find it.

1283
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,951
Kevin can only have sex
in bed, in the dark,
under the covers,

1284
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,369
only after
we have showered

1285
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,367
separately.

1286
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,541
And sometimes,
by the time
we are finished

1287
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,752
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.

1288
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:19,383
And then I pretend I'm tired,
but I'm not tired.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

1289
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,545
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.

1290
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,340
To experiment,
get it out of your system,
find out what you like.

1291
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,393
Excuse me, could I
have a glass of alcohol
when you get a chance?

1292
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,181
Two double
Seven and Sevens.

1293
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,558
Is that...

1294
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,897
You will like it.
It's sweet.

1295
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,562
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1296
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,698
But I heard about
a woman who went to
the bathroom on a plane.

1297
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,905
She got sucked
into the toilet.

1298
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,528
Sucked right in.

1299
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,782
Are you okay?

1300
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,079
Yes.

1301
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,746
Yeah, I just think
that what you gave me
didn't really do anything.

1302
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,416
I just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

1303
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,841
Why don't you take
my scotch?

1304
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,927
It will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.

1305
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,762
Honestly,
I do it all the time.
Yeah?

1306
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,393
Yeah, and I'm much
smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.

1307
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:14,596
Well, thanks.

1308
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,230
Yeah?
Okay.

1309
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,828
Yummy?

1310
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,117
Yeah, it's good.

1311
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,408
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

1312
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,621
Okay.

1313
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,627
Ohh. LOOK at that.

1314
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,091
Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.

1315
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,263
So you don't even
have sex any more?

1316
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,766
No, I have sex constantly.

1317
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,393
The sex is constant.

1318
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,225
But he hasn't
kissed me in five years.

1319
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,809
What are you doing
when you are
having sex, then?

1320
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,817
Thinking about other things
and wishing it would stop.

1321
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,570
You know, sometimes
I just want to watch

1322
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,655
The Daily Show
without him entering me.

1323
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,072
It's the Wet
Republic Ultra Pool.
No.

1324
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,407
Are you kidding?

1325
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,745
What is it again?

1326
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,493
There is a bar in
the pool and a tiger.

1327
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,287
What?

1328
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,292
- it's crazy.
- It's Vegas at its best.

1329
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,001
Wait a minute.
Is this that place
that was on The Real World?

1330
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,791
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God. It's...

1331
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,427
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

1332
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:31,510
I'm good.
I'm so much more relaxed.
Thank you, Helen.

1333
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:36,179
I just feel like
I'm excited,
and I feel relaxed.

1334
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,472
And I'm ready

1335
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:42,268
to party

1336
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,687
with the best of them!

1337
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:50,279
And i'm going to
go down to the river

1338
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:55,197
Wow! It looks like somebody
is really relaxing now.

1339
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,534
What are you guys
talking about up here?

1340
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,374
We are going to
a restaurant tonight.
I know the owner, so...

1341
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,038
You do?

1342
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,000
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.

1343
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,043
Uhh!

1344
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,384
Big whoop.

1345
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,549
Let's go take a nap.
What do you say?

1346
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,718
Miss, you cannot be up here.

1347
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,228
Hello, grandpa.

1348
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,103
I'm sorry.
I just want
to be here with

1349
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,066
my friends,
because I'm
with this group.

1350
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,069
The sign just went off.
Can't she stay up here
for a minute and just talk?

1351
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,229
Absolutely not.

1352
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,364
Coach passengers
are not allowed
up here in first class.

1353
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,866
It's policy.
I'm sorry.

1354
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,067
Ooh!

1355
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:37,535
This is a very
strict plane
that I'm on.

1356
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,370
Welcome to Germany.

1357
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:44,583
Auf Wiedersehen, asshole.

1358
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:45,747
All right.

1359
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:46,914
Why don't you go lay down?

1360
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,425
I'm going to go take a nap.
I'm tired.

1361
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,589
I think it's a good idea.

1362
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:53,926
Catch you on the flip side,
motherfuckers.

1363
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,015
I'm sorry.

1364
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,182
I'm leaving.

1365
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,305
Thank you.

1366
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,055
This should be open,
because it's civil rights.

1367
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,518
This is the '90s.

1368
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,685
Right. It's not.
You're in the wrong decade.

1369
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,569
You are.
Okay, I am.

1370
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,775
Thank you.

1371
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,573
Holy shit.
What did you give her?

1372
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,172
Miss?

1373
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,048
No. it's not me.

1374
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,592
Yes, it is you.
Please go back
to your seat.

1375
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,806
Yes, I am with him.

1376
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,312
I am Mrs. Iglesias.

1377
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,472
No, you are not.

1378
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,396
You were just out here
and you put sunglasses on.
Out.

1379
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:48,810
But I don't want to.

1380
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,313
Sir, she can
have my seat, okay?

1381
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,569
Everyone should
experience first class
at least once in their lives.

1382
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,946
And Annie shouldn't
miss out just because
she can't afford it.

1383
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,656
No, ma'am, I'm
afraid that's not allowed.

1384
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,787
- Help me, I'm poor.
- No, listen,

1385
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,665
we're a whole wedding party.
I'm the bride.
I'm getting married.

1386
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,668
This seat is empty.
She's obviously nervous.
We'll calm her down and...

1387
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,500
I understand.
But Claire is right.

1388
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,005
Everybody,
go back to your seats.

1389
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,665
Okay, you especially.

1390
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,800
You have three seconds
to get back to your seat.

1391
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,095
You can't get
anywhere in three seconds.

1392
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,346
Well, you'd better try.

1393
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,882
You are setting me
up for a loss already.

1394
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,012
Thank you.

1395
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,678
Whatever YOU Say, Stove.

1396
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,188
It's Steve.

1397
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,312
"Stove."
What kind of name is that?

1398
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,317
That's not a name.
My name is Steve.

1399
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,693
Are you an appliance?

1400
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,696
No, I'm a man,
and my name is Steve.

1401
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,198
You are a flight attendant.

1402
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,030
That's absolutely
accurate.

1403
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,205
You can close that.
Thank you.

1404
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,374
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.

1405
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,164
You want to get
back in that restroom
and not rest?

1406
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,207
No, I have to get
back to my seat.

1407
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:56,002
Yeah, you gotta
get back on my seat.

1408
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,046
You get it?

1409
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,715
Yeah,
I definitely
got it.

1410
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,384
Oh-Oh. what's That?

1411
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,389
I got to get back to my seat.
Could you just
move your leg, please?

1412
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,057
I got to go.

1413
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,316
Oh-oh.
Oh-oh.

1414
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,565
Somebody found a souvenir.

1415
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,736
You feel that
steam heat coming?
That's from my undercarriage

1416
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,284
That can go up
and higher.

1417
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,865
Okay.

1418
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,411
Jon, get us a blanket.

1419
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,916
No.

1420
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,748
I got to take a whiz
and I'll be right back.

1421
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:31,792
Cool.

1422
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:37,802
I don't want you to be
a big fuck-up like me.

1423
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,303
How do you think I feel?

1424
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,090
Like me.
You can still
turn it around.

1425
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,633
No, don't.

1426
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,098
Stop it!

1427
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,979
You are more
beautiful than
Cinderella.

1428
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:53,439
You smell like
pine needles and you
have a face like sunshine.

1429
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,120
What?

1430
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,416
Oh, no.

1431
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:14,998
Ladies and gentlemen,

1432
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,338
as you can see,
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt?sign.

1433
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,595
It appears we've run into
a rough patch of weather...

1434
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,922
I have an announcement, too.

1435
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,972
There is a Colonial woman
on the wing.

1436
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,425
There's a woman on the wing.
I saw her.

1437
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,927
There 's something
they're not telling us!

1438
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,056
Steve.
All right.

1439
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,261
There's a Colonial woman.

1440
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,063
She was churning
butter on that wing.
Steve, get her.

1441
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,640
She is out there right now.
Shit!

1442
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,105
Everyone, remain calm!
I'm an Air Marshal.

1443
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,651
Yes! I knew it.
I got your back, Jon!

1444
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,151
There is a woman on the wing.
I saw her.

1445
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,736
There's something
they're not telling us.

1446
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,784
Let's get out!
Let's open the doors
and get out!

1447
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,537
She is dressed in
traditional Colonial garb.

1448
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,831
Say goodbye!
We are going down!

1449
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:49,953
Stay calm.

1450
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,329
There is something
they are not telling us.

1451
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,082
There is a Colonial
woman on the wing.

1452
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,708
I will cover the pilot!

1453
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,427
Who is she?
What does she want?

1454
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,786
Just let me make it
up to you, please.

1455
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,668
I'm telling you,

1456
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,504
your shower is
going to be amazing.

1457
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,589
I have so many ideas.

1458
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,425
I want to talk to
you about the shower.

1459
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,965
I feel like

1460
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:51,136
it has been really
overwhelming for you.

1461
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,601
It's just starting
to make you crazy.

1462
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,266
No, Lil, I'm fine.
I mean...

1463
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,227
Lil, I'm fine.

1464
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:00,945
No, you're not fine.

1465
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,026
You are not fine, Annie,

1466
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:06,238
and we need things to just

1467
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,404
flow smoothly from now on

1468
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,074
and Helen just knows
how to do this kind of stuff.

1469
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,083
She does it all the time.

1470
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,165
She is good at it.
She likes doing it.

1471
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,248
This way you don't have to

1472
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:24,753
plan any more
lunches or trips.

1473
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,762
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1474
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,264
I get it.

1475
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,766
I think it'll be
best here on out

1476
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,769
for the shower
and for everything.

1477
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,605
Yeah,
whatever you want.

1478
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,438
I mean,
it's probably best.

1479
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,648
I think so, right?

1480
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,154
Yeah.
I just want you
to be happy.

1481
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,440
I think that
will make me happy.
It will be good.

1482
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,654
Okay.
Okay.

1483
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,781
Good.

1484
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:14,885
Hey.

1485
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,303
Hey.

1486
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,973
Do you want to hang out?

1487
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,236
- It's not funny!
- Stop laughing.

1488
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,825
it's a little funny.

1489
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,783
None of those girls
are laughing, believe me.

1490
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,164
It's not funny.
Have you ever been
kicked off a plane?

1491
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,323
I can't say that I have.

1492
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,450
Thank you.

1493
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,337
All of the girls
hate me right now.

1494
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,668
You are like
the maid of dishonor.

1495
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,841
I hope Lillian isn't
going to be mad at me
for too long.

1496
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,721
No, she will be all right.

1497
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,302
I don't know,
I just wish things were

1498
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,845
the way that they
used to be, you know.

1499
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,851
I feel like her
life is going off

1500
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,355
and getting perfect,
and mine is just like...

1501
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,525
It will turn around,
you know.

1502
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,526
I have been hearing
that for a long time.

1503
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,232
It's going to turn around.
I just know it.

1504
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,022
Anyway.

1505
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,195
You got to bake.

1506
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,075
I don't really do
that any more, I told you.

1507
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,406
Why?

1508
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,744
I don't know,
it's just...

1509
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,534
I don't know,
after it just went under,
I just, kind of,

1510
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,582
stopped, I guess.

1511
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,747
It doesn't make
me happy any more.

1512
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,632
Just because you didn't
make any money at it,

1513
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,754
doesn't mean that
you failed at it.

1514
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,382
I lost a lot of money.

1515
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,512
All my money.

1516
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,215
But you are so good at it.

1517
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,883
Oh, well.
Let's change the subject.

1518
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,223
No more baking.
I'm done.

1519
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,558
I don't know how
you just can't do it any more.

1520
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:44,021
If I wasn't a cop any more,
I would still...

1521
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,184
Arrest people?

1522
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,353
...Go out with
a gun and shoot people.

1523
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,648
I probably wouldn't do that.
I'm just trying to
make you feel better.

1524
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,490
You are okay, you know.

1525
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,695
You don't
know me very well.

1526
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,081
I know you well enough
to know that
you're not so bad.

1527
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,913
You got some stuff.
Oh, yeah.

1528
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,827
You got bits and
pieces going on.

1529
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,957
Thanks.

1530
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,004
I have been thinking
about you a little bit.

1531
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,881
About me? Really?

1532
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,508
There is something
about you.

1533
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,215
Something about
you that sticks.

1534
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,685
- I hate buttons.

1535
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,433
Where is the bedroom?

1536
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,903
Sorry. It's a mountain bike.
Are you okay?

1537
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,439
Do you like mountain biking?
Uh-huh.

1538
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,240
Take this off.

1539
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:38,780
I'm so glad
this is happening.

1540
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,198
So am I.

1541
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,802
Hello.
Morning.

1542
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,511
Sorry, I didn't
mean to freak you out.

1543
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,926
No, it's okay.

1544
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,186
I haven't been
sitting here that long.
Oh.

1545
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,025
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep.

1546
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,195
I didn't mean to sleep over.

1547
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,147
Don't be silly.

1548
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,775
I made you a cappuccino.

1549
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,285
Made it?
Yeah.

1550
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,155
So, last night was fun.

1551
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,951
It was.
It was very fun.

1552
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,494
I had fun.

1553
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,288
It was fun.

1554
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:33,342
If you care to
accompany me to the kitchen,

1555
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,252
the fun may continue.

1556
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,513
A different kind of fun.

1557
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:41,266
But why don't you
just get dressed
and whatever, and...

1558
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,768
I left your
clothes over there.

1559
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,228
Okay.

1560
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,683
And I'll see you in there.

1561
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,189
Okay.

1562
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,403
There she is.

1563
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,069
Your workshop awaits.

1564
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,150
I know it's a bit crazy,
but I popped out

1565
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:01,078
and I got a few little
baking bits and pieces.

1566
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,363
Butter, milk.

1567
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:05,078
Because I thought
that it would be fun
for us to bake together today.

1568
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,084
Obviously, you will
be doing the baking.

1569
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,870
I will be doing the eating.

1570
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:11,209
Because you are the expert.

1571
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,215
Yeah, I don't...

1572
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,251
I don't really wanna...

1573
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,966
Sorry. You went to
all this trouble, but...

1574
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,597
Come on, I know you haven't
done it in a while,
but it'll be great.

1575
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,885
Don't be silly,
just get into it.
You are so good at it.

1576
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,430
All right. I get it.

1577
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,145
It was a bit of a curve ball.

1578
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,268
Yeah, I think
I'm going to go.

1579
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,984
I'm sorry.
I should just
probably go.

1580
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,569
Annie,

1581
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,284
I don't know what
you are getting
so upset about.

1582
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,864
Because you don't know me.

1583
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,160
You don't know anything
about me or my life or...

1584
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:48,166
Well, no, because...
I don't know what
you're trying to do here.

1585
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,419
I don't need you to fix me.
To fix you?

1586
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,955
I don't need any help.
I mean, who do
you think you are?

1587
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,875
Jesus, Annie,
we had a really good time.
And now you are being all...

1588
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,590
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have
come here last night.

1589
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,800
Last night was a mistake.

1590
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,340
Fucking hell. All right.

1591
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,158
Hey, it's Lillian.
Leave a message
after the beep.

1592
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,578
Hey, Lil, it's me.

1593
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:25,946
Umm...

1594
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:31,369
I'm sure you're probably still
a little bit mad at me,
but I hope not.

1595
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:36,253
Anyway, the excitement
still continues with me.

1596
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:41,421
I just slept with
a cop that pulled me over

1597
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:46,718
and I woke up today,
and he was really
sweet and nice and cute.

1598
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:50,263
So, naturally,
I ran out
as fast as I could.

1599
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,102
What's wrong with me?

1600
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:53,640
Umm...

1601
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,819
Anyway, I know you
are busy and stuff,

1602
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:00,030
so just call me
when you get a chance.

1603
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:04,365
I'd love to talk
this out with you
when you can.

1604
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,449
Okay, bye.

1605
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,294
Annie! Annie, wake up.

1606
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,208
It's 11:00 a.m.

1607
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,628
Oh, shit.

1608
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,422
You got a package.

1609
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:28,138
I'd bring it to you,
but you said,
"Don't touch my things."

1610
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,456
Please join us for
a Parisian brunch

1611
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,292
at the home of
Helen Harris III

1612
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,549
to celebrate the marriage
of Lillian Donovan
and Douglas Price.

1613
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:09,972
Let us shower Lillian
with gifts and love.
Rpondez s'il vous plait. Yay!

1614
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,610
Excuse me.
Oh. Hi.

1615
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,155
I'm looking for a birthday
gift for my best friend.
Oh.

1616
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,779
I want to get her
a necklace that says,
"Best Friends Forever."

1617
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,069
You sure you want
it to say "Forever"?

1618
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,070
Yeah, why?

1619
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,868
Come on. "Forever"?

1620
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:33,740
Forever.

1621
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:36,043
I don't think you guys
will be best friends forever.
No offense.

1622
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,540
But you know...

1623
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,667
The friends you have
when you are
younger sometimes...

1624
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,961
Sometimes you grow apart
when you get older.

1625
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,587
Maybe she'll find
a new best friend.

1626
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,468
And maybe she
will be more
successful than you are

1627
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,763
and prettier and
richer and skinnier

1628
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,174
and they end up doing
everything together.

1629
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,597
You are weird.

1630
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,436
I'm not weird. Okay?

1631
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,096
Yes, you are.

1632
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,181
No, I'm not,
and you started it.

1633
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,894
No, you started it.

1634
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,934
Did you forget
to take your Xanax
this morning?

1635
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,603
God, I feel bad
for your parents.

1636
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:03,733
I feel bad for your face.

1637
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,115
Okay, well,
call me when
your boobs come in.

1638
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,863
You call me
when yours come in.

1639
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,951
What, do you have
four boyfriends?
Exactly.

1640
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,989
Yeah, okay, have fun
having a baby at your prom.

1641
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,702
You look like an old mop.

1642
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,708
You know what?
You're not as popular
as you think you are.

1643
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:17,784
I am very popular.

1644
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,044
I'm sure you are.

1645
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,622
Very popular.

1646
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,461
Well, you're an old,
single loser

1647
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,209
who is never going
to have any friends.

1648
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,298
You're a little cunt.

1649
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,596
I'm sorry.

1650
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,477
Let me tell my mom, okay.

1651
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,733
I already told her.

1652
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,484
Was she mad?

1653
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,578
Hi, Annie,
it's Rhodes again.

1654
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,163
Since you're not
returning any of my calls,

1655
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,748
I assume that
you're not interested

1656
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,164
in spending any
more time with me,
which is fine.

1657
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,755
So don't worry,
I won't be bothering
you ever again.

1658
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,302
Get those taillights fixed.

1659
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,349
We'd like to invite you
to no longer live
with us any more.

1660
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,518
What? What do you mean?
I don't get it.

1661
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:27,775
The thing is,
we decided that it was
actually a bit immature

1662
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,197
for a grown-up
brother and sister to

1663
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:30,699
still be living
together with a roommate.

1664
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,782
At our age, it's a bit
ridiculous, isn't it?
Yeah.

1665
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,988
We look a bit silly,
don't we?
Pathetic.

1666
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,248
So we are actually
going to live together alone.

1667
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:39,867
Without you.

1668
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,543
You're moving out.

1669
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,419
She's not moving.

1670
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:47,750
She will move.

1671
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,168
Eventually.
Eventually.

1672
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,377
She has to.

1673
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:51,678
She is taking it in.

1674
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,346
You have to leave.

1675
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:54,882
Oh! That's prickly.

1676
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,730
Hi.
Hi.

1677
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,193
Remember when you
thought I hit bottom?

1678
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,403
That wasn't bottom.

1679
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,402
Come here.

1680
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,075
We're gonna have fun.
I, for one,
am really glad you're here.

1681
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,865
And guess what?

1682
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,996
Good timing.

1683
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,741
You know what
just came in today
on the Netflix?

1684
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,327
Cast Away. Tom Hanks.

1685
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,495
It's like Forrest Gump,
but on an island.

1686
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,756
Honey, you are gonna love it.

1687
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,745
My God.

1688
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,664
This is her driveway?

1689
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,247
Who is that man?

1690
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,632
Are you a guest of
Helen Harris III?

1691
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,631
Yes. Technically. I guess.

1692
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,796
An attendant will
meet you at the stables.

1693
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,218
Where?

1694
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:18,556
The shower is over
the second bridge.

1695
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:21,594
Pink lemonade?
Thank you.

1696
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,809
I don't have a cup holder.
Can I just give that...

1697
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,816
Pink lemonade.
Nice. Nice touch.

1698
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,781
Shit.

1699
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,791
God damn it, that's good.

1700
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:45,867
Mmm.

1701
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,629
Shit, that is fresh.

1702
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,648
This is the most
beautiful shower
I have ever been to.

1703
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,518
Yes, and Helen
is giving out the
cutest party favors.

1704
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:14,480
I know,
I love their pink berets.

1705
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:31,879
Would you like
some champagne?
Yes.

1706
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:33,336
It's French.

1707
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,418
Annie. Hey.

1708
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,836
Hi.

1709
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,847
How are you doing?
You're here.

1710
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,850
Yeah, I'm here.
I was invited. Sorry.

1711
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,640
Of course you were invited.
I just meant you have arrived.

1712
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,394
No, I was just joking.
Okay.

1713
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,934
Can you believe this?
Isn't it amazing?

1714
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:53,852
Yep.

1715
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:55,566
Yeah. it's nice.

1716
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,731
Yeah. Pretty.

1717
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,778
Are we okay?

1718
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,402
Yes, I'm sorry
I haven't called.

1719
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,991
I just didn't want
to bug you, but...

1720
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,414
Forgive me.
It just got crazy.

1721
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,334
There has been lots
of organizing, and...
I have so much to tell you.

1722
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,912
I have to say hi to my aunt
or she will get mad at my mom.

1723
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,417
No, you gotta go do
your party rounds.

1724
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,048
Yeah.

1725
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,379
I'll see you in a minute.

1726
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,672
Yeah. Okay.

1727
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,507
Oh! Rita,
you got all our towels.

1728
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,930
Yes, I did.
Because I love you, Kitten.

1729
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:24,174
All right,
let's see what's next.

1730
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,347
Another one,
another one, another one.

1731
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,855
I know who this is from.
I can tell by the wrapping.

1732
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,390
Is that you?

1733
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:36,236
Annie, you made this.

1734
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,276
Look.

1735
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,240
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

1736
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,987
It's us, Annie.

1737
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,569
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.

1738
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,497
Oh, my God.

1739
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:53,500
This is all my
favorite stuff from all the
stores I love in Milwaukee.

1740
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,627
Annie!
This is so unbelievable.

1741
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,129
Wilson Phillips.

1742
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,798
Man, I love Wilson Phillips.

1743
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,009
We listened to Hold On
probably 10,000 times

1744
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:04,840
when I got my
driver's license.

1745
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,972
This is such an amazing gift.

1746
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,637
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1747
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,389
I feel really bad, Lil,

1748
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,566
I didn't get a chance
to actually get you a present

1749
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,689
because I have been so busy
organizing the shower.

1750
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,317
Helen, please.
It's more than enough.

1751
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:21,732
Here is a card to
say congratulations.

1752
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:25,661
Thank you.
Gosh, you have
really outdone yourself.

1753
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,365
Oh, my God, Helen.

1754
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,951
Honey, what is it?

1755
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,038
Helen's taking me
to Paris.

1756
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,129
Your face!

1757
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,801
I got you. I fooled you.

1758
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:42,878
Look at your face.

1759
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:47,178
It's just a little
pre-wedding vacation.
And while we're there,

1760
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,510
we're gonna meet
the designer of her dress
and have a fitting.

1761
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:52,179
You are
taking me to Paris?

1762
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,894
Oh, my God! This is
the best present ever!

1763
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:57,017
Thank you so much.

1764
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,143
A Paris!

1765
01:29:58,268 --> 01:29:59,315
Oh, my God.

1766
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,112
Are you fucking kidding me?

1767
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,153
Annie!
No, Mom.

1768
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,529
Motherfucking Paris?

1769
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:06,739
Annie,
what are you doing?

1770
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:10,160
I told you about Paris, Helen.
I told you about
this whole idea!

1771
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,581
- Annie, calm down.
- No, Lillian!

1772
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,247
What, you're gonna
go to Paris with Helen now?

1773
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,461
What, you guys are
gonna ride around
on bikes

1774
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,209
with berets and
fucking baguettes

1775
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,957
in the basket of
the front of your bikes?

1776
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,212
How romantic!

1777
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,844
What woman
gives another woman
a trip to Paris?

1778
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,888
Am I right? Lesbian.

1779
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,640
We're all thinking it,
aren't we?
I'm not.

1780
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:31,059
Okay? Yes, we're all
thinking it, right?
I was.

1781
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:34,061
Annie...
Lillian, this is not
the "you" that I know.

1782
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,563
The "you" that I
know would have

1783
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:37,065
walked in here
and rolled your eyes

1784
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,684
and thought
this was completely

1785
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,310
over-the-top,
ridiculous and stupid.

1786
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,897
Look at this shower!
Look at that fucking cookie!

1787
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,153
Did you really think
that this group of women

1788
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,368
was going to
finish that cookie?

1789
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,078
Really? You know what?
That reminds me, actually.

1790
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:53,740
I never got a chance
to try that fucking cookie!

1791
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,251
Stupid fucking cookie!

1792
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,758
Delicious! Stupid cookie.
I think I'll...

1793
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,964
Maybe it's better if I
dip it in the chocolate.

1794
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,270
is this what
you want, Lillian?

1795
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:24,483
This is so awesome.

1796
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:30,945
All right,
let's have some nice,
hot, unsanitary chocolate!

1797
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,999
Ahh! It's hot!
Jesus! God!

1798
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,752
Christ, Annie.
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

1799
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,708
What are you doing?
What am I doing?

1800
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,885
You wouldn't know,
would you?
Where have you been?

1801
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,133
You would have no idea.
Let me fill you in, okay?

1802
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,886
Ever since you got engaged,
everything has turned to shit!

1803
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:54,684
You know what?
This is supposed
to be about my time!

1804
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,929
You have managed
to ruin every event

1805
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,181
in my wedding.
Thank you very much.

1806
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,648
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

1807
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,142
It's all her fault.
It is not mine!

1808
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,442
And you would know that,

1809
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,522
if you got your
beautiful haired head
out of your asshole.

1810
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,825
In fact, out of her asshole,
which I'm sure is
perfectly bleached.

1811
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,569
You know what? It is!

1812
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,949
And you know how I know?

1813
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:15,952
Because I went to
the fucking salon with her

1814
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,995
and I got my
asshole bleached, too!

1815
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:21,168
And I love my new asshole!

1816
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,706
You know what?
Why can't you
just be happy for me

1817
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:28,419
and then go home and
talk behind my back later,
like a normal person?

1818
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:32,552
I am happy for you, Lillian.
I am very happy for you.

1819
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,225
I wish you well.
I won't bother
you any more.

1820
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,930
Are you kidding me? Annie!

1821
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,686
Go, go, go, go, go!

1822
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,480
Get back here! Stop.

1823
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,693
No, no! She does
not get a party favor.

1824
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,774
She does not get a dog!

1825
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,952
And if you are
going to act like this,

1826
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:57,451
then don't even bother
coming to my wedding!

1827
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,256
I'm proud of you, Lil.

1828
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,499
Shut up, Helen!

1829
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,755
Anybody else have anything
they want to share today?

1830
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:18,302
I took two dogs already.
They're in the back of my van.

1831
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,079
What?

1832
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,174
What? Where are you going?

1833
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,422
Hit and run! Classy!

1834
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,091
Perfect! Okay.

1835
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:58,763
I'm gonna find you!
I'm coming!

1836
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:03,305
Come on! Come on! Come on.

1837
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:08,768
No!

1838
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,373
Shit.

1839
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:32,175
I can't say
I'm surprised.

1840
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,506
I did tell you to
get your lights fixed.

1841
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,171
Yeah, I know.

1842
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,424
And now here we are.

1843
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:43,391
Look, I have
had a horrible day.

1844
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:45,931
I don't need a lecture
from you right now, okay?

1845
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,644
I just... Helen just...

1846
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,100
Oh! Don't...

1847
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,273
This didn't happen
because of Helen.

1848
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,322
This happened
because you didn't get
your taillights fixed.

1849
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,982
It's pretty simple.

1850
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,783
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

1851
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:04,249
to see you,
night by night,
drive past me

1852
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,126
with your fucking
taillights still broken?

1853
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:09,413
Do you have any idea
how crazy that makes me?

1854
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,002
It's a simple solution!

1855
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,173
Your problem, Annie,

1856
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:16,173
is that you just
don't understand
that you can hurt people

1857
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,509
with these broken lights.

1858
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,850
Don't you see how
irresponsible this is?

1859
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:25,680
Yes, I should have
gotten my fucking
taillights fixed.

1860
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,768
But I didn't, okay?
I didn't.

1861
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,104
Listen,
don't worry about it.

1862
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,815
Seriously.
Your message
was received.

1863
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,776
No, look, please,
I don't know what's
going on with me right now.

1864
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:39,701
Look, it's fine. Don't bother.
Really, what's done is done.

1865
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,361
That's it?
Where are you going?

1866
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,114
That's it! That's it.
That's how this works.

1867
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,286
Come on. I didn't...

1868
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:49,120
For the record, Annie,
you flirted with me.

1869
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,465
You made me feel like
you really liked me,

1870
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:54,882
which was really unfair.

1871
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:58,712
And then you came home with me
and we did stuff, fun stuff,

1872
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,177
and then you just left,
just like it was nothing.

1873
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:06,265
Oh, please. I know
how guys do this thing.

1874
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:07,846
I know how guys act.

1875
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,561
One minute,
it means something.
The next minute, it doesn't.

1876
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:11,729
Right, yeah, you've
got it all figured out.

1877
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:12,896
Yeah.

1878
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,695
How is that
working out for you?
Pretty good?

1879
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,154
Boom!

1880
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:22,577
What's up, fuck-buddy?
You call for some
roadside assistance?

1881
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:31,002
Thanks, officer.
I can handle it
from here on out.

1882
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,087
Come on!

1883
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:40,045
I didn't have
anyone else to call!

1884
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,505
I didn't know that
you were gonna show up!

1885
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:43,009
That's the problem
with cops, Annie.

1886
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,599
We're just never
there when you need us.

1887
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:47,765
That cop talks weird.

1888
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:58,063
- Come on, dingus.
Tick-tock. I got shit to do.

1889
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:01,449
Check it out.
Look what's steering the car.

1890
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,324
Thanks again
for picking me up.

1891
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:10,909
Not a problem.

1892
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,828
Were you busy?

1893
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,250
Well, it is Friday.

1894
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:20,176
You know,
you look tired.

1895
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,387
If you're tired,
you can totally

1896
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,631
lay down in my lap,
if you want.

1897
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:26,220
What?

1898
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,552
Just take a little lap-nap.

1899
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,229
If you want.

1900
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:38,440
Open for biz.

1901
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,150
Okay, can you just pull over?

1902
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,236
Yeah, actually,
that's an even better idea.

1903
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:45,740
No, no, no, can you
please just stop the car?
I want to get out.

1904
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:46,990
No, it's super gravelly.

1905
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,038
Please pull over!
Why?

1906
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,491
Because I would rather
get murdered out here

1907
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,747
than spend the next
half-an-hour with you.

1908
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:55,453
Can you please
just pull over?

1909
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,922
Come on, Annie.
It's called humor.

1910
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,924
Learn about it.

1911
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,715
Besides, I would
never last a half-hour.

1912
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:08,382
Good bye, Ted.

1913
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:15,728
If you're trying to
turn me on, it's working.

1914
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,477
You used me!

1915
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,944
No big deal.
You are no longer
my number three!

1916
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,082
Wilson!

1917
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:44,093
Wilson! I'm sorry!

1918
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,843
I'm sorry, Wilson.

1919
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,017
Wilson, I'm sorry!

1920
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:52,760
I'm sorry!

1921
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,141
Oh, no, Wilson.

1922
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:55,475
Wilson!

1923
01:38:57,682 --> 01:38:59,355
I'm coming in.

1924
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,519
Let's go, let's go.
And we're walking.

1925
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,813
Okay, we're walking.
Heel. Heel!

1926
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,574
No pee. No!
Not on the carpet!

1927
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,860
Okay, we're coming...
We're coming in.

1928
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:11,321
Everybody is in
and having fun.

1929
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,740
We're having fun.
And heel! We're heeling.

1930
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:15,450
Heel!

1931
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,330
How many of
those did you take?

1932
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,126
I took nine.

1933
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:25,044
Yeah, I did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

1934
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:28,050
It turns out, I'm probably
more comfortable with six.

1935
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:31,307
It's a lot... That's
a lot of energy to deal with.

1936
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,059
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,

1937
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,769
because you haven't
been returning my calls.

1938
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,477
And say what, Megan?

1939
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,526
Say, "Hi, I can't
get off the couch.

1940
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:45,196
"I got fired from my job.
I got kicked out
of my apartment.

1941
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:48,525
"I can't pay any of my bills.
My car is a piece of shit.

1942
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,157
"I don't have any friends.
The last time

1943
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,579
You know what I
find interesting
about that, Annie?

1944
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,624
It's interesting to me
that you have
absolutely no friends.

1945
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,167
You know why
it's interesting?

1946
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,669
Here's a friend
standing directly

1947
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:01,162
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.

1948
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,709
And you choose to
talk about the fact

1949
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,252
that you don't
have any friends.

1950
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,709
You know what I mean.

1951
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,210
No, I don't think
you want any help.

1952
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,341
I think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.

1953
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,514
I think Annie wants
a little pity party.

1954
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:13,679
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1955
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,352
You're an asshole. I'm life.
Is life bothering you?

1956
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:17,474
Yes! What are you doing?

1957
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:18,684
I'm life, Annie.
I'm life, Annie.

1958
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:21,311
You have got to
fight back on life.

1959
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,642
Megan!

1960
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,019
You better learn to fight.

1961
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:25,269
Megan!

1962
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,151
I'm life and I'm going
to bite you in the ass!

1963
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,238
Megan...
it's not me.
I'm your life. Turn over!

1964
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:32,489
My God!

1965
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:36,448
I'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!

1966
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:37,578
You just won't do it.
Stop it.

1967
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:39,996
You stop slapping yourself.
Stop slapping yourself.

1968
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,662
I'm your life, Annie.
I'm your shitty...

1969
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,039
I'm sorry.

1970
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,166
Nice hit.

1971
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:50,962
All right.

1972
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:53,298
I'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.

1973
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:56,008
I knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.

1974
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:57,852
I think...

1975
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,355
I think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.

1976
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,562
A girl named Megan.

1977
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,226
A girl named
Megan that didn't have

1978
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,898
a very good time
in high school.

1979
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,156
I'm referring to
myself when I say "Megan."

1980
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:12,237
It's me, Megan.
Yeah, I got that.

1981
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,902
I know you look at
me now and think,

1982
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,953
"Boy, she must have
breezed through high school."

1983
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,575
Not the case, Annie.

1984
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:21,501
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?

1985
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,169
They used to
try to blow me up.

1986
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:24,879
They threw
firecrackers at my head.

1987
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:26,497
Firecrackers.

1988
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:29,295
I mean literally.
I'm not saying
that figuratively.

1989
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,094
I got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.

1990
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:33,880
Do you think I
let that break me?

1991
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,595
Do you think I went home
to my mommy, crying,

1992
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:39,427
"I don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends"?

1993
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,888
No, I did not.
You know what I did?

1994
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:44,474
I pulled myself up,
I studied really hard.

1995
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,730
I read every book in
the library. And now?

1996
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,231
I work for the government.
I have

1997
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,774
the highest possible
security clearance.

1998
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,401
Don't repeat that!
I won't.

1999
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,527
I can't protect you.

2000
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:55,068
I know where
all the nukes are
and I know the codes.

2001
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,116
I won't say anything.

2002
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,490
You would be amazed.

2003
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,083
A lot of shopping malls.

2004
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,500
Don't repeat that!

2005
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:04,870
I won't.

2006
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,128
I have six houses.

2007
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:09,544
I bought an 18-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because I could.

2008
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:10,841
Okay, you lost Lillian.

2009
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,259
You got another best friend

2010
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:14,008
sitting right in front of you,
if you would notice.

2011
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,967
Huh?

2012
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,765
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

2013
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,051
Okay, 'cause I do not
associate with people

2014
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:21,803
that blame the world
for their problems.

2015
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,638
'Cause you're
your problem, Annie.

2016
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:26,182
And you're also
your solution.

2017
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,272
Right? I mean, that's...

2018
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,480
You get that?

2019
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:34,115
I just miss her, I guess.

2020
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,152
Yeah, I know you do.

2021
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,578
I know you do.

2022
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:41,955
All right, come on.
Bring it in.

2023
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:43,453
There's the Annie...

2024
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:45,250
There's the Annie I
knew was there, okay?

2025
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:47,621
All right.
Man, you have got
to wash your hair.

2026
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:48,746
I'm sorry.

2027
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,251
You've got to
wash that hair.

2028
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,195
What's wrong?

2029
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,701
Nothing.

2030
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:24,703
I love you.

2031
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,681
Looks great. Thank you.

2032
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:44,723
Rhodes and I worked out
a deal way back when,
so it's on the house.

2033
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:46,520
Are you serious?

2034
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,019
Yeah. I owe him big time.

2035
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,017
That's really nice.

2036
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,693
Hey, Mom?

2037
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,158
This is my mom, Judy.

2038
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:05,239
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

2039
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,245
Good to meet you, too.

2040
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,244
Wait a minute,
don't I know you from AA?

2041
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:13,923
Oh, my gosh.
You made that artichoke dip,
didn't you?

2042
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:15,583
It's good, huh?

2043
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,713
It's just delicious.

2044
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:22,608
Come in.

2045
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,290
Are you sure
you're not gonna
come with me today?

2046
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,034
It's Lillian's big day.

2047
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:32,914
Mom, she doesn't
want me there.

2048
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,548
I'll fix you
a tuna fish sandwich.

2049
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,130
Mom, it's 8:00
in the morning.

2050
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,673
You can put syrup on it.

2051
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,059
I know.

2052
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:55,224
Hi.

2053
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,650
What do you want?

2054
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,857
I was wondering
if you knew
where Lillian was.

2055
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,151
No, why would I...
What do you mean?

2056
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:04,150
I can't find her.
We've looked everywhere.

2057
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:05,408
What?

2058
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:07,657
She is missing.
Can you help?

2059
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,826
Okay, just wait here.
I think I know

2060
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,662
someone that
might be able to help.

2061
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:13,997
I'll get my Keys.
Can I just use...

2062
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:21,087
I mean, I just don't know
what could have
possibly gone wrong.

2063
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,759
Everything was going smoothly.

2064
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,803
The dress looked fantastic.
It had come in from Paris.

2065
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:27,423
Dougie was being
great and very helpful.

2066
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:32,137
I had organized everything
to the last final detail.

2067
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:33,687
I just...

2068
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:35,519
I don't know
what's happened to her.

2069
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,851
I don't know.
You should know, right?

2070
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:41,233
You're her best friend.
It's weird that
you don't know.

2071
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:42,647
You guys are so close.

2072
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:50,238
Annie, I want to
apologize to you personally

2073
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:53,115
for all of the things
that have gone down.

2074
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:55,121
I know that I hurt you,

2075
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,703
and that I created a distance
between you and Lillian.

2076
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,629
I want to
apologize for that...
I don't want to hear...

2077
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:01,252
...and everything
that happened

2078
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,920
at the shower.
And with Las Vegas...

2079
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,798
Okay, I don't want
to hear any more,
honestly.

2080
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:06,971
I don't even
want to talk to you.

2081
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:09,841
Harry never really
wants to talk to me, either.

2082
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:12,643
He travels a lot.
Like, all year.

2083
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,346
I'm basically just by myself.

2084
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:18,478
I don't want to...
I don't feel sorry for you.

2085
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,394
I really liked
that original dress

2086
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,236
you picked at
the bridal store.

2087
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:26,236
I thought it was beautiful.
You have really lovely taste.

2088
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:29,785
Thanks, but it's
a little too late for that.

2089
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,116
And I know...

2090
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:34,165
I don't think
that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.

2091
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,240
NO, it did.

2092
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,374
No, I don't think it did.

2093
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,452
It was the food.
I shit my pants
on the way home.

2094
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,957
I don't think it
was your fault.

2095
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,248
That was my fault.

2096
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,797
I think people just
ask me to their weddings

2097
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:48,592
because I'm good at
organizing parties.

2098
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:53,426
I don't have any
female friends.

2099
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,970
I'm so sorry.

2100
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,473
Why are you smiling, Annie?

2101
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,312
It's just...
It's just...

2102
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,943
It's the first time I've
ever seen you look ugly.

2103
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,854
And that makes
me kind of happy.

2104
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:08,983
I look ugly? No, I don't.
I don't really look ugly.

2105
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:11,364
A little bit.
You're an ugly crier,
but that's okay.

2106
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,161
No, I'm not really
an ugly crier.

2107
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,830
Maybe just
a little bit.
No.

2108
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:16,332
Just a little bit.

2109
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,167
It's just my makeup.

2110
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:21,374
But I still look pretty good.

2111
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:26,174
Rhodes!

2112
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:28,460
Rhodes.

2113
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:30,466
Rhodes.

2114
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,098
Come on! Rhodes!

2115
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:34,884
He's ignoring you.
Let me.
Yes, he is.

2116
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,969
- Officer!
- Roll down your window!

2117
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:40,015
Excuse me! Please!

2118
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:43,775
Rhodes,
I know you can hear me,
and I know you're mad at me,

2119
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,562
but I need your help. Please!

2120
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:51,071
You know this guy?

2121
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:01,334
What are you doing?

2122
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,037
I just want to
get his attention.

2123
01:49:04,329 --> 01:49:06,423
Annie! Oh, my God.

2124
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:10,966
Reckless driving!

2125
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:17,010
Annie, my hair!
What are you doing?

2126
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:19,353
I'm speeding!
You better pull me over!

2127
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:23,561
Really?

2128
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:25,567
Here comes
the litter-bug!

2129
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:32,032
Let's see what
Marmaduke's doing.

2130
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:34,785
Just texting.
Talking on the phone
while I'm driving.

2131
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,363
Not even using my hands.
Oh, hi!

2132
01:49:39,448 --> 01:49:40,449
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

2133
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,159
Beer!

2134
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,285
Yum! Yum! Yum!

2135
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:45,083
Idiot.

2136
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:49,291
Hey, what's up, man?

2137
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,638
I don't care. I don't care.

2138
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:09,770
I'm going to hurl.
I feel really sick, Annie!

2139
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,775
Hey, who's driving that car?

2140
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:17,574
Can we go up now?

2141
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,406
That's not clever.

2142
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:21,831
Hey!

2143
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:23,409
I'm topless!

2144
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,203
I'm totally topless.

2145
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:36,971
Really?

2146
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,926
Wow. Unbelievable.

2147
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,978
What the fuck are you doing?

2148
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,184
I don't know.

2149
01:50:44,263 --> 01:50:45,810
Hey! Are you crazy?

2150
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,270
Are you crazy?

2151
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:50,356
All of that stuff,
that would have been
dangerous for a good driver.

2152
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,606
I'm sorry. I just...
I really need your help.

2153
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:54,898
We can't find Lillian.

2154
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:57,527
How long has she been gone?

2155
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,903
She's been
missing for 12 hours.

2156
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:00,321
12 hours?

2157
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:03,036
It's not a missing person
until it's at least 24 hours.

2158
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,334
Have you ever seen CSI?
24 hours.

2159
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:08,003
Let me get on
with my job, Annie.

2160
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:10,915
Nathan, please?

2161
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:12,128
I really need your help.

2162
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:15,506
Please, Nathan.

2163
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,129
Who is this one?

2164
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:18,635
This is Helen.
I'm Helen.

2165
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:19,969
What?

2166
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:21,304
It's Helen.

2167
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:25,638
Hello, Helen.
I've heard wonderful things.

2168
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,902
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Bye-bye.

2169
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,653
Okay, we've traced
her cell phone

2170
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:35,405
to the corner of
Craner and Rose.

2171
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:37,574
Do you know where that is?

2172
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,697
Yes. That is her apartment.

2173
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,657
I thought you said
you looked there.

2174
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,867
We did. We did.
Last night.

2175
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:44,035
Okay.

2176
01:51:44,323 --> 01:51:47,076
So you're saying
she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?

2177
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:48,832
She must have gone
back after you left.

2178
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,208
God, that was crazy of her.

2179
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:51,671
Thank God! Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go.

2180
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:53,005
Okay.

2181
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,837
We found her!

2182
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:04,260
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to
waste your time.

2183
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,186
That's embarrassing.

2184
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:09,269
Thank you.
No, you are welcome.

2185
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:11,350
It's this kind of
high-octane stuff

2186
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,518
that really made me
want to become a cop.

2187
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:15,946
"Missing girl found
at her apartment."

2188
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:17,526
It's...

2189
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:19,691
It's adrenalin-pinching.

2190
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:23,662
It's nice to see you.

2191
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:30,498
I'm glad that you got
your taillights fixed.

2192
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:32,584
Means I won't have
to stop you again.

2193
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,548
Okay.

2194
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:41,881
Annie, let's go.

2195
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:46,010
Anyway,
go and save your friend
from her apartment.

2196
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:47,887
Bye-bye.

2197
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:49,396
Bye.

2198
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:20,090
Do you mind actually
if I go by myself?

2199
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,589
Sure.
Okay.

2200
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,425
Lil?

2201
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,060
Lillian?

2202
01:53:30,846 --> 01:53:31,847
Lil?

2203
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:32,931
Go away.

2204
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:42,945
What happened?

2205
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:49,118
This whole
wedding is fucked up.

2206
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:51,746
Helen just took
over everything, and

2207
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:55,712
everything's got
out of control.

2208
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:58,666
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.

2209
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:03,094
This has been really
hard to do without you.

2210
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:07,095
It's been shitty.

2211
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:10,928
I'm sorry.

2212
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,805
Nope. I'm sorry.

2213
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:16,104
I'm sorry I kicked
you out of my wedding.

2214
01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:18,985
It's my fault.

2215
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:20,108
No, it's my fault.

2216
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:23,111
I think I'm the one
with the mental problems.

2217
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:24,532
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?

2218
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:25,901
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.

2219
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:26,985
Yes, technically.

2220
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:29,988
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
I out-crazied you.

2221
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,662
Everything's
going to be okay.

2222
01:54:33,909 --> 01:54:36,128
Yeah? How do you know that?

2223
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,671
I left the rehearsal
dinner last night.

2224
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,961
I told Dougie I
had to go get Q-tips.

2225
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:45,504
And

2226
01:54:46,588 --> 01:54:49,717
all of a sudden,
I realized I was
driving here.

2227
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,892
I came here.

2228
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:57,771
I realized this
is the last time
I'm going to be here

2229
01:54:57,933 --> 01:54:59,651
in this apartment

2230
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,062
with that couch,

2231
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:02,688
and this bed,

2232
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:04,777
and take a bath in my bathtub.

2233
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,783
Because you know
how much I love my bathtub.

2234
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:07,992
It's a good tub.

2235
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,738
I slept in there on my
30th birthday, remember?
Uh-huh.

2236
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:13,495
Everything's gonna change.

2237
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,001
I mean, I'm not
going to get to

2238
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,042
live five
minutes away from you.

2239
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:23,834
And it makes me so sad.

2240
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,339
Well, don't be.

2241
01:55:29,965 --> 01:55:32,935
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,

2242
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,479
but they'll be better.

2243
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,398
You know?

2244
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:43,361
You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.

2245
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,652
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.

2246
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:48,988
And so do I.

2247
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:55,787
But what about you?
What's gonna happen to you?

2248
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:03,799
I'm gonna be fine.

2249
01:56:06,251 --> 01:56:08,970
So don't worry, okay?
I'm gonna be...

2250
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:10,756
I'm gonna be fine.

2251
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:12,636
I am fine.

2252
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:19,686
And besides, you need
to blaze the trail for me.

2253
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:22,772
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.

2254
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:25,816
Whatever you say, boss.

2255
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:30,196
All right, let's get
your dress on,

2256
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:32,285
okay, and let's go
to your wedding.

2257
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:35,538
Oh, yeah.

2258
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:37,783
That's the other problem.

2259
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:52,306
Don't you dare laugh.

2260
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:01,269
Okay.

2261
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:03,567
I cannot wear this dress!

2262
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,310
Okay, don't panic.

2263
01:57:06,478 --> 01:57:07,980
This is a nightmare.

2264
01:57:08,813 --> 01:57:10,360
We'll fix it.

2265
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:12,196
We'll tweak it.

2266
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:14,406
I will not let you
walk down that aisle

2267
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,363
unless you look
perfect and beautiful,
I promise.

2268
01:57:16,655 --> 01:57:19,829
Do you have a chainsaw
and a blowtorch?

2269
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,917
I think this wedding
is gonna be a disaster.

2270
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:26,088
No, don't say that.

2271
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:28,424
If Helen had anything
to do with this wedding,

2272
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,095
it is going to be perfect
and tasteful and beautiful.

2273
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,171
That's true.

2274
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:37,009
Will you, Douglas,
take Lillian to be your wife?

2275
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:40,187
Will you love her,
comfort her, and keep her

2276
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:43,269
and, forsaking all others,
remain true to her

2277
01:57:43,348 --> 01:57:45,350
as long as you
both shall live?

2278
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:46,480
I do.

2279
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,359
And will you,
Lillian, take Douglas
to be your husband?

2280
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,781
Will you love him,
comfort him, and keep him

2281
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,237
as long as you
both shall live?

2282
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:55,869
I do.

2283
01:57:57,696 --> 01:57:59,869
By the powers
vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

2284
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,867
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

2285
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:03,209
You may now kiss the bride.

2286
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,634
Ladies and gentlemen,

2287
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:20,140
here with us tonight is
Lillian's favorite band
singing her favorite song.

2288
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:24,557
Put your hands
together for
Wilson Phillips!

2289
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:29,811
Hi, everybody!

2290
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:33,566
How we doing tonight?

2291
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:36,075
I am not paying
for this shit.

2292
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:39,405
Really?

2293
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:42,449
It's the last one,
I promise.

2294
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:44,250
The last one.
The last one.

2295
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:47,833
I know this pain

2296
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:53,260
Why do you lock yourself
up in these chains?

2297
01:58:55,086 --> 01:58:58,386
No one can change
your life except for you

2298
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:04,100
Don't ever let
anyone step all over you

2299
01:59:04,596 --> 01:59:08,226
Just open your
heart and your mind

2300
01:59:09,768 --> 01:59:12,612
ls it really fair to feel

2301
01:59:13,313 --> 01:59:15,190
This way inside

2302
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,612
Someday
somebody's gonna make you

2303
01:59:19,778 --> 01:59:22,031
want to turn
around and say goodbye

2304
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:24,115
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them

2305
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,208
hold you down
and make you cry?

2306
01:59:26,284 --> 01:59:27,285
Don't you know

2307
01:59:27,452 --> 01:59:29,125
Don't you know
things can change

2308
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,459
Things'll go your way

2309
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:34,880
if you hold on
for one more day

2310
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:40,307
Can you hold on
for one more day?

2311
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:43,810
Things'll go your way

2312
01:59:44,135 --> 01:59:46,854
Hold on for one more day

2313
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:58,821
You could sustain

2314
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:03,826
Or are you
comfortable with the pain?

2315
02:00:05,323 --> 02:00:09,829
You've got no one
to blame for your unhappiness

2316
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:10,961
No, baby

2317
02:00:11,037 --> 02:00:14,337
You got yourself
into your own mess

2318
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:19,547
Letting your
worries pass you by

2319
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:20,965
Baby

2320
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:26,513
Don't you think
it's worth your time
to change your mind?

2321
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:28,021
No, no

2322
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:30,352
Someday
somebody's gonna make you

2323
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:31,641
want to turn
around and say goodbye

2324
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:34,273
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them

2325
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:35,862
hold you down
and make you cry?

2326
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,022
What's so funny?

2327
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:42,703
I put a loaded gun
in Dougie's carry-on.

2328
02:00:43,528 --> 02:00:47,408
The TSA is going to
just rip his ass apart.

2329
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,245
Annie?

2330
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:54,914
Oh. Hey.

2331
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,344
Did you have
a nice evening?

2332
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:02,505
It was beautiful. Yeah.

2333
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:04,884
What did you
think of the wedding?

2334
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:07,264
It was...

2335
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:08,386
It was great.

2336
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:09,679
It was great, right?
Yeah.

2337
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,060
It was perfect.

2338
02:01:11,723 --> 02:01:12,975
It was great.

2339
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,396
Yeah, it was great.

2340
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:19,864
It was really
nice meeting you.

2341
02:01:20,774 --> 02:01:22,447
Yeah, it was...

2342
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:25,283
Helen, it was really
nice meeting you, too.

2343
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:30,992
Hey, you know, maybe

2344
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:34,750
sometime the three of us
could go to
Rockin' Sushi together.

2345
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:39,418
Thank you, Annie.

2346
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,257
I would love that.

2347
02:01:47,634 --> 02:01:49,602
Your ride is here.

2348
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:07,953
Hey, how did everything go?

2349
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:11,248
Strangely well.

2350
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:12,458
Good.

2351
02:02:15,453 --> 02:02:17,080
So, I ate your cake

2352
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,503
that you left.

2353
02:02:19,624 --> 02:02:20,625
You did?
Yeah.

2354
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:22,051
I mean, I had to
fight some raccoons off.

2355
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:25,305
But that's okay.
I'm pretty strong and tough,

2356
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:27,640
so it wasn't
much of a contest.

2357
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:28,891
So that might have been...

2358
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:30,310
I'm just going to
kiss you now
rather than just...

2359
02:02:43,314 --> 02:02:44,691
Officer Rhodes,
please report to...

2360
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:45,775
Oh! I'm on duty.

2361
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,236
And I need to
put my uniform on.

2362
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:50,242
If I drive like this,
they're gonna think
I just stole a car,

2363
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:51,493
which wouldn't be great.

2364
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:55,160
You could ride
with me if you want.

2365
02:02:55,326 --> 02:02:57,294
You want to come?
Yeah, I do.

2366
02:02:57,495 --> 02:02:58,542
Come on.

2367
02:02:58,621 --> 02:02:59,622
All right.

2368
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:00,836
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

2369
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,004
I'm getting in the car.

2370
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:03,756
No, no, no, you got
to get in the back.
What?

2371
02:03:03,918 --> 02:03:06,091
You can't sit in the front,
it's against regulations.

2372
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,264
Come on. Come on.

2373
02:03:08,423 --> 02:03:10,141
You're going to make
me sit in the back seat?

2374
02:03:10,341 --> 02:03:11,593
Yeah, come on.

2375
02:03:11,676 --> 02:03:12,768
Sorry. Habit.

2376
02:03:13,094 --> 02:03:14,346
All right.

2377
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,687
It's a force of habit.

2378
02:03:19,475 --> 02:03:20,852
Can I please get
in the front seat?

2379
02:03:21,019 --> 02:03:24,023
Actually, no, I'm afraid
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

2380
02:03:24,188 --> 02:03:25,861
What? why?

2381
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:28,614
Reckless driving,
littering, texting,

2382
02:03:28,776 --> 02:03:30,699
consuming alcohol
while operating a vehicle.

2383
02:03:30,862 --> 02:03:31,909
You didn't
think I was going to

2384
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:33,581
let you get away
with that, did you?

2385
02:03:34,365 --> 02:03:36,618
Could we put the siren on?
Please?

2386
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,497
Thank you.

2387
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:44,380
I know that there is pain

2388
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:46,837
But you hold
on for one more day

2389
02:03:47,003 --> 02:03:50,553
And you break
free from the chains

2390
02:03:51,883 --> 02:03:54,557
Yeah,
I know that there is pain

2391
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:56,687
But you hold
on for one more day

2392
02:03:56,846 --> 02:03:59,895
And you break free,
break from the chains

2393
02:04:02,143 --> 02:04:04,396
Someday
somebody's gonna make you

2394
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,739
want to turn
around and say goodbye

2395
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:08,900
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them

2396
02:04:09,025 --> 02:04:10,993
hold you down
and make you cry?

2397
02:04:11,152 --> 02:04:12,153
Don't you know

2398
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,572
Don't you know
things can change

2399
02:04:13,738 --> 02:04:15,581
Things'll go your way

2400
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:18,084
if you hold on

2401
02:04:19,577 --> 02:04:20,874
Okay. Umm...

2402
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:25,380
This is Tape 119.

2403
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:29,345
Air Marshall Jon and I's
first sexual encounter.

2404
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:31,089
Is there
a hungry bear anywhere?

2405
02:04:31,214 --> 02:04:32,591
I'm a hungry bear.

2406
02:04:32,757 --> 02:04:34,885
I just happen to
have this bear sandwich.

2407
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:36,177
Is there a hungry bear?

2408
02:04:36,302 --> 02:04:37,428
I'm a very
hungry bear.

2409
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:39,268
Did you see how
my flap opens?

2410
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:42,354
Yeah, that's
a good-looking
bear sandwich.

2411
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:44,106
Yeah, that's a
big bear sandwich.

2412
02:04:44,268 --> 02:04:46,441
Do you want a bite
of that sandwich?
Feed me.

2413
02:04:46,604 --> 02:04:47,651
It's meat and cheeses.

2414
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:51,780
Uh-Oh.

2415
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:56,035
I hope you don't have
a salad. Oh, yeah.

2416
02:04:57,532 --> 02:04:59,330
Hey, guess what.
Guess what, ham.

2417
02:04:59,409 --> 02:05:00,410
Fuck it up.

2418
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:01,710
I'm gonna fuck you up,
ham nipple.

2419
02:05:01,786 --> 02:05:03,038
Ham nipple.
Fuck it up.

2420
02:05:04,372 --> 02:05:05,794
A little hard.

2421
02:05:05,999 --> 02:05:07,000
OW!

2422
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:09,131
A little hard.
A little hard.
