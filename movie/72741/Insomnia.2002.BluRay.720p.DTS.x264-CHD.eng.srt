1
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,800
There's just nothing down there.

2
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,270
I haven't seen a building
in, like, 20 minutes.

3
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:23,037
-Look at that.
-We're not on vacation, Hap.

4
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:25,371
Cheer up, will you?

5
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,572
Tell that to her, partner.

6
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:31,412
Better hang on, guys.
It's gonna get rough.

7
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,891
Detective Eckhart,
Detective Ellie Burr.

8
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,788
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,326
How are you doing?

10
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:16,431
" Halibut fishing capital
of the world." Okay.

11
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,967
Detective Dormer,
it's an honor to meet you.

12
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,400
Welcome to Nightmute.
I got the car right here.

13
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:39,516
It's so incredible
to be working with you.

14
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:44,625
I've followed all of your cases:
Theodore Dineli, Frank Prud'homme...

15
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:50,424
...the Ocean Park shootings and
especially the Leland Street murders.

16
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:54,967
Is that where Ronald Langley cut you,
at 325 Leland Street?

17
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,832
You did your homework.

18
00:05:57,006 --> 00:06:00,874
The Leland Street murders was
my case study at the academy.

19
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:05,480
-I'll take you to the Lodge and--
-No, take us to the station.

20
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,110
Right. We need to get started.

21
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:11,753
Most homicides are solved
in the first 72 hours.

22
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:15,721
Well, it's 48 hours.
We're a day behind.

23
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,950
But who's counting?

24
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,498
Yeah, come in.

25
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:34,200
They got you behind a desk, huh?
Charlie Bubbles. How you doing?

26
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,073
-I haven't seen you since when?
-Hey, Charlie.

27
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,839
-Seven years?
-Eight.

28
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:44,475
Seven years! I am old.
Ellie, get everyone in the bullpen.

29
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:47,718
-Nice kid.
-Loves the job.

30
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:54,794
When I called Buck for advice on this,
I never expected he'd send you up here.

31
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,827
-Something about lnternal Affairs?
-They're moving in.

32
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:05,030
It's nothing. It's the usual crap.
Buck figured you could use some help--

33
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,767
They got Finn and Kentor on Narcotics.

34
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:10,503
The fuckers are looking
for headlines--

35
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,911
-It's gonna blow over.
-Got a message from Warfield.

36
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,676
I.A.'s pit bull.

37
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,015
He wants to be posted
on your movements.

38
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,789
You'll find us more straightforward.

39
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:27,952
Good guys, bad guys, but a lot
less public relations. It's simple.

40
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:31,993
Except for this.

41
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:36,635
Okay, listen up.
Detectives Dormer and Eckhart...

42
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:39,899
...on loan from Buck Lundgard,
L.A. Homicide.

43
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,373
They'll help with the Connell case.

44
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:47,606
Anything they want to see, show them.
Anyplace they want to go, take them.

45
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:51,275
This is Fred Duggar.
He's heading the investigation.

46
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,512
-A pleasure.
-Want to get on it?

47
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,123
-Seen what we got?
-Let's start with the body.

48
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,226
-You got the report?
-I want to see for myself.

49
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,756
Herniation of the brain stem
due to intracerebral hemorrhage.

50
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:09,495
-Beaten to death.
-These contusions?

51
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:14,166
Superficial. Most of the trauma
was to her face and neck.

52
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,879
-Any signs of rape?
-No.

53
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:22,507
-This one covers an older bruise.
-There's an older one here.

54
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:26,621
-They're both in the report.
-He washed her hair.

55
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:34,325
Scrubbed her nails.

56
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:37,799
It's all in the report.

57
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:42,062
-Doesn't say he clipped them.
-She could have clipped them.

58
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:45,764
Nope. No polish on the ends
of the nails. See?

59
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:51,338
She painted them herself.
Someone else cut them. Toes too.

60
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:56,683
-Naked when found?
-Yeah. Last seen wearing a red dress.

61
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,786
No fibers, flakes, hairs?

62
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:03,152
We know about forensics work here.
The body gave us nothing.

63
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:09,662
She gave us plenty.
All this trouble, all this care. Why?

64
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:16,635
-He knew her.
-He knows we can connect him to her.

65
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:19,774
This isn't a random psycho?
Crime of passion?

66
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:25,380
Maybe. But whatever happened,
his reaction wasn't passionate.

67
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:28,914
He didn't panic.
Didn't chop her up or burn her.

68
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:33,020
He just thought about
what we would be looking for...

69
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:37,352
...and then calmly removed
all those traces.

70
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:40,586
No haste. No rush.

71
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,926
Why clip the nails
after scrubbing them?

72
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:47,432
Manipulating the body.
Prolonging the moment.

73
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,696
No mutilation.

74
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,434
Not this time.

75
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:55,274
-You think there's been others?
-No.

76
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:59,206
But there's gonna be. This guy...

77
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:03,947
...he crossed the line
and he didn't even blink.

78
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,244
You don't come back from that.

79
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:11,520
Okay. Let's go find out who Kay was.

80
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:19,825
Fred said not to touch anything,
so I haven't tidied up.

81
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:23,596
She hates it when I go
into her room anyway.

82
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:27,673
Thank you, Mrs. Connell.

83
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,749
So she went to a party Friday night.

84
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:44,655
Not exactly a party. It's a local dive
where the kids hang out.

85
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,055
No diary?

86
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,720
We didn't find one.
Her mom said she has a journal.

87
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:53,425
Friends said she argued
with her boyfriend Friday.

88
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,503
She stormed off just after midnight.

89
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:59,001
She did, huh?

90
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,236
This is interesting.

91
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,447
Who is this?

92
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:20,025
Tanya Francke, Kay's best friend.

93
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,657
I want to talk to her.

94
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:28,927
Who is Kay Connell? Who is she?
Is she popular or is she a loner?

95
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:33,301
Did she like this town?
She want to bolt first chance she got?

96
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,306
Did she have dreams?

97
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,310
She knew this guy.
We know her, maybe we can know him.

98
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:42,642
This is designer. This is expensive.

99
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,549
-The boyfriend, Randy.
-Randy Stetz.

100
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,213
-He could afford this?
-He's in school.

101
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,621
-Mom didn't buy it.
-What are we thinking?

102
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:55,126
I don't know, stepfather?
Any rich uncles?

103
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,628
No.

104
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,067
An admirer.

105
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,565
Yeah.

106
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,540
-I want the boyfriend.
-I'll get him to the station.

107
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,669
I want to go to the school.
Pull him out in front of friends.

108
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,579
Catch him off guard.
It will get people talking.

109
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:19,744
So how far away is the school?

110
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:26,327
-It's 1 0:00, Detective Dormer.
-You bet.

111
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,819
At night.

112
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,660
So when does it get dark here?

113
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,062
It doesn't.

114
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,501
Not this time of year.

115
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,005
Yeah, I heard about that.
How come you didn't know that, Hap?

116
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,217
-Lower 48.
-Lower 48?

117
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:55,856
Not from here.
Can tell by your walk.

118
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,624
-How's that?
-Unsure.

119
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,723
Dormer and Eckhart.
We have a reservation.

120
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,731
Don't be fooled by my friend's
frivolous demeanor. He's all business.

121
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,637
-Your restaurant still serving?
-Kitchen's about to close.

122
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,200
We'll be quick. Thank you.

123
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:15,632
Thanks.

124
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:20,811
We got the Halibut Calabrese,
got the Halibut Olympian.

125
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:23,383
-Keep going.
-Halibut Cajun style.

126
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,817
I can't wait to see
what they got for dessert.

127
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,883
Natives are getting restless.

128
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,789
-We gotta talk.
-No, we don't.

129
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:36,226
-Just sit tight?
-Nothing's changed.

130
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,592
Nothing's changed?

131
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:42,499
What do you think we're doing
in the halibut capital of the world?

132
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,730
Buck figured Charlie needed help.

133
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:49,605
Buck figured l.A. would be coming
to me next, and he was right.

134
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:54,646
Warfield had me in his office
for three hours yesterday.

135
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,377
Hap, he's rattling your cage, pal.
That's all.

136
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:05,015
Me and Trish talked it through,
and I'm sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

137
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:08,719
-Don't say this shit to me.
-You won't be involved.

138
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,865
I'm not? Of course I will.

139
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,763
With your reputation,
he can't touch you.

140
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,665
My reputation's the whole problem.

141
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:24,009
You think Warfield gives a fuck
about you shaking down drug dealers?

142
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,639
You think that will get him
his headlines? He needs the big fish.

143
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:32,048
He's putting the squeeze
on you to get to me.

144
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,951
-But you're clean, Will.
-I'm a good cop, yeah.

145
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:41,494
But there's always something they
could use to get at your credibility.

146
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,257
Have you any idea
what this is gonna do?

147
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:49,733
Think about all my cases. All the cases
dependent on my word, my judgment.

148
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:53,499
Those fuckers on the street.
That's what you're doing.

149
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:57,202
They got nothing on you
because there's nothing to get.

150
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,508
Dobbs.

151
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,084
-What about Dobbs?
-That's different.

152
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,514
It's different?

153
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,484
Warfield doesn't want
Dobbs on the street.

154
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,593
It's a house of cards. Once it starts,
it's just gonna tumble. All of it.

155
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:16,287
That's a chance I gotta take, pal.

156
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,064
-I got family.
-Don't give me that.

157
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,203
Warfield made it clear.
I get probation.

158
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,500
We're cops, man.
This is not about us.

159
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:31,245
This is about all the people who
depend on us. People with families.

160
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,577
I spent my life doing this. My life.

161
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:39,516
You're gonna destroy it like that.
Why? Why?

162
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,385
So some l.A. prick gets closer
to being chief of police?

163
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:49,155
Or playing golf with the mayor
or whatever the fuck else he's after?

164
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:51,589
You finished?

165
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:57,163
Sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

166
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:01,636
So, make any decisions?

167
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,378
-You do everything around here?
-After 1 1, pretty much.

168
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,412
Over to you, Will.
What are you having?

169
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:20,060
I lost my appetite.

170
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,634
Excuse me.

171
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,322
Morning.

172
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:13,372
-What kind of calls you get here?
-Mostly drinking-related problems.

173
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:17,348
Domestic abuse, bar fights,
that sort of stuff.

174
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,182
People here come to live
the way they want to...

175
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,824
...so most people keep to themselves.

176
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,856
Chief won't let me handle anything
over a misdemeanor.

177
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,792
Don't knock misdemeanors.

178
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,162
No, but it's such small stuff.
It's so boring.

179
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:37,829
It's all about small stuff.
You know, small lies, small mistakes.

180
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:43,876
People give themselves away same
in misdemeanors as in murder cases.

181
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:48,641
It's just human nature.
Aren't you gonna write that down?

182
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:14,997
Friends making you nervous?
They think you did it?

183
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,107
You killed her?

184
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,273
-No smoking on the school premises.
-Did you love her?

185
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:27,714
-Randy, did you love her?
-Sure, she was nice.

186
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:33,020
She was nice. Wow.
That makes me all soft inside.

187
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,754
Did it occur to you
she didn't love you?

188
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,864
She loved me.

189
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,491
-Wanted me every night.
-Probably to pass the time.

190
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,666
Girl like Kay Connell, she was looking
for more than some loser. Right?

191
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:50,035
What can I say? Love is blind.

192
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:51,974
-Live on your own?
-His grandpa's.

193
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:55,116
-No alibi for Friday?
-Didn't know I'd need one.

194
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:58,912
-At the party what'd you fight about?
-Stuff. No big deal.

195
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,351
-I heard it was a loud fight.
-I guess.

196
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,755
-I heard it was pretty rough.
-lt wasn't rough.

197
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:10,990
Not like the other times.
Those times she wouldn't listen to you.

198
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,430
Couldn't keep her mouth shut.

199
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:17,059
-Keep fishing, man.
-We saw the bruises.

200
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,297
They said she was beaten.

201
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:23,638
Not those bruises. Come on.
The old bruises. Your bruises.

202
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:27,281
I'm sick of this.
I haven't done anything wrong.

203
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,041
You haven't?

204
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:31,474
Fuck you!

205
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:35,783
You're a prick in a leather jacket.
What the fuck do you know?

206
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,190
Randy...

207
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:48,363
...this whole thing you're doing,
this fuck-the-world act.

208
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:52,768
It might work with your mom.
It might even work with local cops...

209
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,502
...who know you enough to figure
you're too dumb to kill...

210
00:19:56,711 --> 00:20:00,613
...without leaving witnesses
and a signed confession.

211
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,250
It ain't gonna work with me.

212
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:08,452
Because I know things. You understand?

213
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:12,320
I know you beat your girlfriend.

214
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,224
I know she was seeing somebody else.

215
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,526
Someone she might have gone to see
after she walked out on you Friday.

216
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:25,867
Now are you gonna tell us
who that somebody might be?

217
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,941
Or are you so fucking stupid...

218
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:34,810
...you're gonna leave yourself as the
last person to see Kay Connell alive?

219
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,684
I don't know.

220
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,651
You don't know.

221
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,217
I couldn't get her to tell me.

222
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:56,202
How hard did you try?

223
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:59,732
Pretty hard.

224
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:19,957
-You think he....
-No.

225
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,528
How'd it go?
Find where this is from.

226
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,665
Mrs. Connell and her
friends don't know.

227
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:30,463
You try the jewelry stores?
Small things, remember?

228
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:34,836
The second you're about to dismiss
something, think about it.

229
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:37,136
Look at it again.

230
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,677
Want me to write that down?

231
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,248
No, I'll remember it.

232
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,453
-Where was it?
-ln a cabin on the beach.

233
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,826
-It's Kay's?
-Her books are in it.

234
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,797
-Kids found it.
-Cabin secured?

235
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:03,233
-Francis is headed there.
-Stop him.

236
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:05,634
-Tell him to stay clear.
-Rich.

237
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,332
Biology and Algebra.

238
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,072
Let's find out who she studied with,
where she bought this.

239
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:18,244
" Otherwise Engaged.
A J. Brody mystery."

240
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,512
-Who reads this crap?
-I do.

241
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:23,418
Read it. After it's dusted.

242
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:28,119
Find anything that strikes you,
plot-wise, underlined passages.

243
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:29,854
There it is. The diary.

244
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:31,293
Every word.

245
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:35,525
That's it.

246
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:37,603
-I'll put it in evidence.
-No.

247
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,034
Why?

248
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,676
Call every radio station
from here to Anchorage.

249
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:47,281
Tell them we're looking for
the bag Kay left the party with.

250
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,884
-Get it on the air in the next hour.
-You got it.

251
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:54,488
Fill that bag up with books
and put it back.

252
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,127
Gonna eat this son of a bitch alive,
knowing he missed this.

253
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:07,826
You know something, Charlie?
Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

254
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:11,070
A guy picks up a bag,
don't make him guilty.

255
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,467
Will, it's solid.

256
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,873
I don't know. This kind of thing.
Maybe we do this by the numbers.

257
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:20,674
-Come on.
-l.A.'s gonna be on my ass.

258
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:25,547
I don't want this turning up in some
court when my rep's in the shit...

259
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,746
-...and they're pulling apart my cases.
-Bullshit.

260
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,619
What the fuck you care?!

261
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,200
Someone beat a girl to death.
Your job is to find him.

262
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:44,998
You're a cop, not a lawyer.
Don't let l.A. cut your balls off.

263
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,867
Charlie's right, Will.

264
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:10,230
OP 1, this is OP 2.
We still got nothing.

265
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:12,429
Yeah, it's nice. Light.

266
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,899
All plastic except for the barrel.
Never rusts.

267
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,397
What do you carry down in L.A.?

268
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:20,700
-Smith & Wesson.45.
-Excellent.

269
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,809
-Anything?
-No.

270
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:36,117
-Maybe he doesn't listen to the radio.
-He prefers the voices in his head.

271
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,951
Hey, Will?

272
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:54,040
We have somebody moving
towards the cabin.

273
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,575
Okay, fan out.
Nice and easy.

274
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,409
Shit.

275
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:07,645
Come on, go!

276
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:29,370
Police!

277
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:33,138
Police! Come out!

278
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:43,851
Fuck!

279
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:47,324
Down there, huh?

280
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,557
Down to the water. Spread out!

281
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:51,892
Go!

282
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:56,166
Fuck it.

283
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:41,412
Dormer!

284
00:26:56,164 --> 00:26:57,529
Hold it! Who's there?

285
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:03,300
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

286
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,229
-Will?
-Don't talk.

287
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,525
-Will.
-Don't talk. Don't talk.

288
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,328
-Here.
-You sh--

289
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:45,699
You....

290
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:47,840
You shot....

291
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,070
I know. I couldn't see, Hap.
I couldn't see in the fog.

292
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:54,380
You tried to....

293
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:57,210
You tried to kill me? Fuck you.

294
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,250
No, listen, Hap.

295
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,379
-Listen to me now. No, no.
-Get away, get away!

296
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:07,084
No, I couldn't see you in the fog.
I couldn't. I--

297
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:09,653
I couldn't see you, Hap.

298
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,430
Don't go. Come on.

299
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,721
-Man down!
-Who's down?

300
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:43,127
-Man down here!
-Spread out!

301
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:51,066
Dormer! Where'd he go? Which way?

302
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,297
Dormer! Which way?

303
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:56,373
That way.

304
00:29:57,478 --> 00:29:58,843
Fuck.

305
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,849
You gave chase.

306
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:16,963
After you left Farrell,
you heard the killer's second shot.

307
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:20,931
You ran down to the water.
You found Hap.

308
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:23,929
Will?

309
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:26,899
Is that what happened?

310
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,744
-Did Hap say anything?
-Damn it!

311
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:35,143
Why didn't I know about
the goddamn tunnel?

312
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:40,045
You don't move on a suspect
without knowing his exits.

313
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,190
There's a bunch of those
tunnels out there.

314
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:45,917
Closed years ago
when they were mines.

315
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:51,030
-I don't even know most of them myself.
-I had him, Charlie.

316
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,524
As close as you are now.

317
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,770
I could smell the son of a bitch.

318
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:03,536
-And I blew it.
-There's no point in blaming yourself.

319
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:08,872
-I fucked up everything.
-Don't come apart on me, understand?

320
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,042
I need you to find this bastard.

321
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,085
Yeah.

322
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:19,018
-You wanted to see me?
-You're on Eckhart's shooting.

323
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:23,186
But we know what happened,
and I'm on the Connell case.

324
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:27,892
Anchorage wants to send someone.
I told them we can do it. Can't we?

325
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:30,898
-Sure.
-Write it up. No Shakespeare.

326
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:35,073
Just enough to fry this
son of a bitch longer. Right?

327
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,016
Hello?

328
00:31:54,261 --> 00:32:00,029
Jenny, it's Will.
Can you put your mother on?

329
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,401
Hello?

330
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,906
Trish, it's Will.

331
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:12,375
What's happened?
They won't tell me anything.

332
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:14,036
It's Hap....

333
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:17,842
Is he okay?

334
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,184
No, he's gone, Trish.

335
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:23,823
He' s dead.

336
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,290
What?

337
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:33,798
Trish, I can' t tell you
how sorry I am.

338
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,129
What was he doing, Will?

339
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:42,571
This guy killed a girl, and, so we....

340
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:45,709
We had him....

341
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:50,407
We found him and we had him cornered.
And then he ran and....

342
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:52,279
Hap....

343
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,147
I'm so sorry.

344
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,982
-I'm just so sorry.
-Did he suffer?

345
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:04,727
-No, I don't--
-Did he say anything?

346
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:14,831
Well, when I found him he....

347
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,301
He was peaceful.

348
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:22,514
-Did you get him?
-No, no. Not yet.

349
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,844
You find him.

350
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,311
And when you do, don 't arrest him.

351
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:31,925
You understand me, Will Dormer?

352
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,959
Don't you dare fucking arrest him!

353
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:38,689
-Okay, Trish.
- You understand?

354
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,197
Okay.

355
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,900
Trish, listen.

356
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:46,705
I' m--

357
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:06,416
--was shot and killed this evening...

358
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:10,114
...in an attempt to apprehend
a suspect in the murder...

359
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,954
...of 1 7-year-old
local girl, Kay Connell.

360
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:18,525
I' m sorry. It' s been
on the radio for hours.

361
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:22,293
We' re not used to this
kind of stuff up here.

362
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:28,637
He was standing right there.
Last night.

363
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,676
I hope I was nice to him.

364
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:35,948
He liked you.

365
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:51,844
Detective? I'm sorry to bother you,
but could you just point...

366
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:55,681
...to where you were
when you heard the second shot?

367
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:59,020
Sorry to make you do this right now.

368
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,957
That's all right.
You're doing your job.

369
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:03,289
Where was l?

370
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:05,256
-There.
-Thank you.

371
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:08,559
No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh?

372
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:12,102
No, we'll have the other
one for ballistics after...

373
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:14,700
...the autopsy.

374
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,403
I'm really sorry.

375
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,250
-Clean through, huh?
-Yeah.

376
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:30,117
Bullet got lost in the rocks, I guess.

377
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:33,225
Well, better luck next time.

378
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,158
You ever been shot?

379
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:38,297
Yeah, I have.
Kind of itches, don't it?

380
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,763
We gotta catch him.
Did you get a look at him?

381
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:46,067
-When?
-When I left you.

382
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,141
-You see anything?
-I was in a lot of pain...

383
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:53,905
...and when I heard that second shot,
I kept my goddamn head down.

384
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:55,672
Hey, I'm...

385
00:38:56,283 --> 00:38:58,342
...sorry about Detective Eckhart.

386
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,747
Sorry about that megaphone.

387
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,884
-Maybe if I hadn't--
-Farrell, listen.

388
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,151
What were we doing
running around in the fog?

389
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:11,323
We doing it for our health?
We were chasing someone.

390
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:15,960
So anything that happened
on that beach is not your fault.

391
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:19,332
That's the fault of one man
and one man only.

392
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,941
And that's the man who beat
Kay Connell to death.

393
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,181
At this point, Dormer
encountered Brooks.

394
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,947
The suspect, obscured by fog,
shot Officer Brooks...

395
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,785
...in the vastus externus
of the left thigh.

396
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,826
You're Farrell.
You were shot in the leg.

397
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:43,155
Come on, Ellie.

398
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,389
When you get this,
get the cone.

399
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,432
-This his blood?
-Ketchup maybe.

400
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:52,161
Was he eating a hot dog?

401
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:58,003
Anything he dropped...

402
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:01,639
...you put in a bag.

403
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:05,683
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers,
coins, anything.

404
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:08,878
Suspect will often
leave something behind.

405
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:10,812
Detective Dormer...

406
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:15,589
...Iost the suspect in the fog
then heard a shot...

407
00:40:15,762 --> 00:40:18,424
...coming from
a northeasterly direction.

408
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:21,791
-He wasn't that way.
-How do you know?

409
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,994
Because I saw him.

410
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,600
-Turn this way.
-Are we almost done here?

411
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:29,739
My nads are freezing off.

412
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,844
Ellie! I think I found something.

413
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,246
-Should they start further over?
-No.

414
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:39,180
He stayed by the water
far as he could.

415
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:44,153
I saw him over the rocks.
He knew he'd lose us down there.

416
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,286
Duggar.

417
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:51,464
Where'd he find it?

418
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:52,960
Okay.

419
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,425
Yeah, well, just let me know.

420
00:40:58,071 --> 00:40:59,402
Okay.

421
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:01,271
I will.

422
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,946
Dormer?

423
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:11,411
They found Farrell's bullet.
Looks like a.38.

424
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:14,844
We'll get both bullets to the lab.

425
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:19,048
See if we can get a fix on the weapon.
If it's okay with you.

426
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:24,559
A guy came by.
Said he was your new partner.

427
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:26,626
-Did he leave a name?
-No.

428
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:30,601
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

429
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:33,102
-Pioneer Lodge.
-Warfield for Dormer.

430
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,969
John Warfield.
He's called a couple times.

431
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:40,341
Want me to lie?

432
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:43,072
No, I'll take it.

433
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,142
Thank you.

434
00:41:48,588 --> 00:41:49,646
Dormer here.

435
00:41:49,823 --> 00:41:55,318
I was shocked to hear about your
partner. I was getting to know him--

436
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:56,757
What do you want?

437
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,764
You know what I want,
Eckhart was gonna give it to me.

438
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:03,492
You got something to say, just say it.

439
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:06,901
-He told you about our conversation?
-Say it.

440
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:11,943
Let's just say I'm interested to see
your report on what happened.

441
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,937
Don't presume to know what happened.

442
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,778
You weren' t here.
But then, you never are, are you?

443
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,749
You' re always safe behind some desk,
reading your bullshit reports.

444
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:28,291
And that is why I have
nothing but contempt for you.

445
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,898
You and all the assholes like you...

446
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:37,301
...risk nothing, spend all day sucking
the marrow out of real cops...

447
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:41,463
...when you never had
the balls to be one yourself.

448
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:08,553
-Detective, you came yourself.
-Yeah.

449
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:11,418
Sign here.

450
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,130
He didn't suffer too much.

451
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,997
-What's the caliber?
-Don't know.

452
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:30,506
The gunshot victims I see are
from rifles. Wasn't one of those.

453
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,809
-Had any sleep, detective?
-Yeah.

454
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:04,842
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Sorry.

455
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:10,571
No problem.

456
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:14,943
-Bullet. I want results by tomorrow.
-Aye, aye, cap'n.

457
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:17,951
We should check Randy's
whereabouts.

458
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:19,921
Think it was Randy out there?

459
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:24,052
He still doesn't have an alibi.
You said he beat Kay.

460
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:26,929
-You check it out, then.
-I will.

461
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,123
Detective Dormer?

462
00:46:58,298 --> 00:46:59,890
My report. I finished.

463
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,796
I need you to look it over
and sign it.

464
00:47:03,636 --> 00:47:09,097
It's self-explanatory. I look forward
to getting back to work with you.

465
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:13,075
We have more important
things to do than paperwork.

466
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:25,055
A man died, Ellie. This is important.

467
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:28,694
Of course. I didn't mean
to imply that that wasn't--

468
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:31,922
Be sure of your facts
before you file this.

469
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:35,799
It's your name on the report.

470
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:51,266
He couldn't have come from there.

471
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,985
Dormer here.

472
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:11,828
-Hello?
-Can't sleep, Will?

473
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:13,966
Me neither.

474
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:15,326
Who' s this?

475
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:20,097
I got a nap this afternoon,
but I guess you had to work.

476
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:21,740
Who am I speaking to?

477
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:24,672
Get rid of your clock yet?
Won't help.

478
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:28,746
When I moved here, I went
five nights. You believe that?

479
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:32,315
-This crazy light.
-A name or l' m gonna hang up.

480
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:37,286
No, you're not. You need the company.
Nothing as lonely as not sleeping.

481
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:42,359
Feels like the whole fucking planet
is deserted. Just you and me.

482
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,325
So...

483
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:48,732
...tell me who l' m talking to,
and we can chat a while.

484
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,732
-I can 't do that.
-Why not?

485
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:54,169
-Not till you understand some things.
-Like what?

486
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,001
I saw.

487
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:02,512
-Saw what?
-Saw you shoot your partner.

488
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:07,449
Saw him die in your arms
on that beach.

489
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,386
I thought you'd blame me.
That's why I dropped my gun.

490
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,288
-My uncle 's old.38.
-Yeah.

491
00:50:14,494 --> 00:50:18,328
- You get it? What about ballistics?
-Listen to me now.

492
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:21,990
I don' t know what you think you saw.

493
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:25,695
We should discuss this,
don't you think? Face to face.

494
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:29,466
This situation isn't yours
to control. I saw you.

495
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:32,975
I'll control this situation, pal.

496
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:38,083
Because you don't hide from me
in a town this small. Get it?

497
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:39,980
No, not for long.

498
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:43,953
I need your help.
I'm not telling anyone anything.

499
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:46,614
We're partners on this.

500
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:24,688
--but to be remembered
as the Kay we knew and loved.

501
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:28,389
Swimming,
hiking through the Kebaughs...

502
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:31,365
...meeting at Darrow' s after school...

503
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:37,009
...and always,
always with a smile on her face.

504
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:40,072
Detective Dormer?

505
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:45,843
I want to check something. I was
going over my report last night...

506
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:50,284
...and I have a question about
where that second shot came from.

507
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,550
You said you heard it
from the waterline...

508
00:51:53,793 --> 00:51:57,229
...but from the way
Detective Eckhart's body fell...

509
00:51:57,397 --> 00:52:02,164
...it couldn't have come from
the rocks further up from the water.

510
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:08,304
Do you think it's possible you heard
the shot before you hit the waterline?

511
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:12,369
-Detective Dormer?
-Yeah, it's possible.

512
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:14,702
Yeah.

513
00:52:20,953 --> 00:52:22,853
Why don't I give her a ride?

514
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,924
-Thought I smelled something.
-How you doing? Coping?

515
00:52:27,093 --> 00:52:28,720
-You're that cop.
-Yeah.

516
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:32,830
-Are you coming or not?
-Not.

517
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,567
Hey.

518
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:47,245
You want a stick of gum?
I love chewing gum.

519
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:50,438
It keeps me awake.

520
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:55,819
-I never met anyone from L.A. before.
-Not missing much.

521
00:52:55,988 --> 00:52:59,583
-So how do you like our shithole town?
-It's not bad.

522
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:05,694
-Were you good friends with Kay?
-Best friends. Since grade school.

523
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:09,130
-That's a long time.
-Yeah, we were like sisters.

524
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:13,295
Like sisters? Must be tough
for you what happened, then.

525
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:17,465
Everyone keeps telling me
I'm doing great, considering.

526
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:20,373
But they're all real worried about me.

527
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,038
They don't even care
if I show up for school or not.

528
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,616
Worried I haven't cried yet.

529
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:30,322
But ain't no law says
you gotta cry, right?

530
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,185
No, there ain't.

531
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,692
What about her other friends?

532
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:45,537
Do we have to talk about
Kay right now? God.

533
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:48,936
I don't want to think
about all that. Just drive.

534
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:51,042
I understand.

535
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:56,782
-Want me to take you somewhere?
-As long as it's fun.

536
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,744
Young, impressionable girl...

537
00:53:59,952 --> 00:54:04,787
...Ieft alone with older Los Angeles
cop. Who knows where we might go?

538
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:07,423
Well, I know a place.

539
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:12,398
Let's just drift a while.

540
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:15,163
Look at this.

541
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:17,231
Who does he think he is?

542
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:20,201
What does he think he's doing?

543
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,765
-Move over.
-Let him move over.

544
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,306
Come on! Move over!

545
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:28,113
What are you doing?
Move over, you crazy fuck!

546
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:37,120
Just a little visit to the dump!

547
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:42,227
-You should feel at home.
-You just about killed us! Get off me!

548
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:45,898
-What is this?
-You and Kay were like sisters?

549
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:50,432
-Yes. I told you.
-Why are her pictures of you torn?

550
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:55,198
Why was her boyfriend's hands
all over your ass at her funeral?

551
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:58,900
Randy doesn't have an alibi
because he was with you.

552
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:02,973
You were out fucking
your best friend's boyfriend.

553
00:55:03,182 --> 00:55:07,482
-That what best friends do?
-She never really loved Randy, okay?

554
00:55:07,753 --> 00:55:09,414
-She didn't love him?
-No.

555
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:13,080
How do you figure that?
She have someone else?

556
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:16,921
-I don't know.
-Someone bought her dresses, jewelry?

557
00:55:17,296 --> 00:55:18,854
Hey, look around.

558
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:23,502
I want to show you something.
You'll understand why I brought you.

559
00:55:23,669 --> 00:55:28,606
This is the spot where your
best friend's naked body was dumped.

560
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:31,971
Wrapped up in garbage bags!

561
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:36,680
Tanya...

562
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:42,413
...I know you don't want anyone knowing
you betrayed your best friend.

563
00:55:42,622 --> 00:55:47,059
That's why you won't give Randy
an alibi for Friday night. I know.

564
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,424
Tell me who Kay was seeing.
And we can forget the whole thing.

565
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:55,727
It'd be our secret. Our little secret,
but I need a name.

566
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,994
She wouldn't tell me, okay?

567
00:55:58,237 --> 00:56:01,536
She wouldn't tell you?
You're her best friend.

568
00:56:01,707 --> 00:56:04,699
-lt was her big fucking secret!
-Why a secret?

569
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,880
I don't-- Because she thought
she was special...

570
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:13,051
...and she kept saying he'd
help her get out of here.

571
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:15,117
-Who is "he"?
-I don't know.

572
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,983
-She talked about him?
-Yeah.

573
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:18,850
-She talked to you?
-Yeah.

574
00:56:19,091 --> 00:56:21,525
And what did she call him?

575
00:56:21,727 --> 00:56:24,924
-She called him something, right?
-Yes!

576
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,599
What? What'd she call him?

577
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:30,592
Brody.

578
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:36,137
She called him Brody. That's not
his name, so what's the difference?

579
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:41,269
Jesus! You happy now,
you fucking asshole?

580
00:56:47,386 --> 00:56:50,822
Okay. You did good. Come on.
I'll let you drive.

581
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,397
It's just poetry.
I read it line by line.

582
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:10,008
It's nothing specific. Verses
on nature, love. That sort of stuff.

583
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,807
Detective Dormer. Line one.

584
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:16,074
-Dormer here.
-How're you holding up?

585
00:57:16,315 --> 00:57:20,513
Can't be easy to keep working
after three days of no sleep.

586
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:22,584
And hard to keep focus.

587
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:24,723
Are you seeing things yet?

588
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:28,826
You know, those little flashes?
Tricks of light?

589
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:30,221
See your partner?

590
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:36,125
-I see Kay sometimes.
-What can I do for you, sir?

591
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:39,304
Why couldn 't you tell
anyone you shot him?

592
00:57:39,805 --> 00:57:43,605
I mean, it was an accident, right?

593
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:47,177
I hope so. For your sake.
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:49,337
No need for threats.

595
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:52,813
I'm trying to make you
understand my situation.

596
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:57,388
You thought no one would believe
you because of the trouble in L.A.

597
00:57:57,556 --> 00:57:59,854
I know what that's like, Will.

598
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,222
-I got the same problem.
-You do?

599
00:58:05,631 --> 00:58:07,758
I'm not who you think I am.

600
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:09,400
-You' re not?
-No.

601
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:16,003
-I'm not a murderer any more than you.
-Why don' t we get together?

602
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:20,236
-T al k, have a beer, whatever?
-Throw a little gas on the fire?

603
00:58:20,446 --> 00:58:21,913
Yeah--

604
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:37,190
I gotta go check some things.
Why don' t you...

605
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,456
...put this stuff back
into evidence and tell....

606
00:58:40,966 --> 00:58:42,331
-What' s that guy?
-Fred.

607
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,129
T ell him l' ll see him in the morning.

608
00:58:45,337 --> 00:58:48,272
Can we return this?
Her mother might like it.

609
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,430
Sure.

610
01:00:12,992 --> 01:00:14,619
That's right.

611
01:04:21,273 --> 01:04:22,262
Here.

612
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:51,300
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

613
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,962
Will, you there?
Where else can you go in that state?

614
01:04:55,174 --> 01:04:57,301
You must've been freezing.

615
01:04:57,509 --> 01:05:02,139
If you want, take a shower.
There are clean towels in the bathroom.

616
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,719
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

617
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:16,156
Will, pick up.
I'm not dumb enough to come back--

618
01:05:16,361 --> 01:05:19,091
-Walter Finch.
- Will.

619
01:05:19,298 --> 01:05:21,391
Will Dormer, what are you doing?

620
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,229
I try to help and you're running
around like a maniac.

621
01:05:25,437 --> 01:05:28,873
Were you gonna kill me?
How would you explain that?

622
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:34,376
No one gets too upset when child
murderers are brought in feet first.

623
01:05:34,546 --> 01:05:38,915
There's no evidence I killed Kay.
You know because I told you.

624
01:05:39,118 --> 01:05:43,179
-Come on. What's wrong with you?
-Guess I'm a little cranky.

625
01:05:43,388 --> 01:05:46,016
-Lack of sleep.
-Get some rest, will you?

626
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:49,227
Got some pills,
and my bed's nice and comfy.

627
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:54,255
Another night up and you'll lose it.
Hallucinating, babbling.

628
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:59,631
Tomorrow when you feel better,
we 'll meet in public. We 'll sort it out.

629
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,934
There 's a ferry north of Nightmute.
I'll be on the 1 1 :00.

630
01:06:04,176 --> 01:06:09,113
And before you leave, could you
feed the dogs? They're on a diet.

631
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:47,682
Dormer? Fax from the lab.

632
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:50,287
Weapon was a.38 Smith & Wesson.

633
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:56,189
-We found something that might--
-I found this. At the Connells'.

634
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,897
And?

635
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:06,469
It's the author of the book
we found in Kay's bag.

636
01:07:06,638 --> 01:07:09,334
It's signed by the author.
He's a local.

637
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:12,669
Kay had all his books.
We should check it out.

638
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:17,672
-Small stuff, right?
-Yeah. Sure, sure.

639
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:21,444
Nice work, Ellie.
She's got sharp eyes, huh?

640
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:24,720
You bet your ass she does.

641
01:07:25,424 --> 01:07:27,051
Good stuff.

642
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:11,866
What a view.

643
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:16,939
-I'm not who you think I am.
-No?

644
01:08:18,176 --> 01:08:19,234
Walter Finch:

645
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:23,278
Lousy writer. Lonely freak.

646
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:25,916
Murderer. No?

647
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:30,521
When I was 7, my grandmother
took me to Portland.

648
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:34,652
We were walking along
and two guys snatched her purse.

649
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,726
A police officer came
to ask questions.

650
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:41,229
He stood the whole time.
Uniform looked brand-new.

651
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,464
Shoes, badge were polished.
It was like a soldier, only better.

652
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:49,368
I respect your profession.
I write about it.

653
01:08:49,574 --> 01:08:54,204
I wanted to become a cop after school.
I couldn't pass all the tests.

654
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:58,281
You should've tried lnternal Affairs.
They'd have taken you.

655
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,418
What do you want from me?

656
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:04,578
After Kay died, I knew everyone
would think I meant to do it.

657
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:09,193
So I cleaned the body, removed
all evidence connecting it to me.

658
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:12,160
Except for your fucking novel.

659
01:09:13,298 --> 01:09:16,131
You don't always see
the wood for the trees.

660
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:19,737
You, for one, should have
figured that out by now.

661
01:09:29,147 --> 01:09:33,345
When I heard they had brought
somebody from L.A., I panicked.

662
01:09:33,552 --> 01:09:37,181
I knew the locals would
connect me to Kay eventually.

663
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:42,019
I could handle them. They never
look in the eyes of a killer.

664
01:09:42,794 --> 01:09:45,661
Killing changes you. You know that.

665
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,628
It's not guilt.

666
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:50,391
I never meant to do it.

667
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:53,936
It's like awareness.

668
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,906
Life is so important.
How could it be so fucking fragile?

669
01:09:58,076 --> 01:10:00,601
You'd see it right away,
wouldn't you?

670
01:10:00,812 --> 01:10:04,839
You trying to impress me?
Because you got the wrong guy.

671
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:07,917
Killing that girl
made you feel special.

672
01:10:08,253 --> 01:10:10,721
But you're not.

673
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:17,385
You're the same pathetic freak
I've been dealing with for 30 years.

674
01:10:17,596 --> 01:10:20,793
Know how many of you
I caught with your pants down?

675
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:27,165
-I never touched her like that.
-You wanted to. Now you wish you had.

676
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:31,008
Best you could do is clip her nails.

677
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:36,377
Now you're so different.
You don't get it, do you?

678
01:10:36,548 --> 01:10:39,312
You're my job.
You're what I'm paid to do.

679
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:44,087
You're about as mysterious to me
as a toilet is to a plumber.

680
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:49,390
Reasons for doing what you did?
Who gives a fuck?

681
01:10:49,594 --> 01:10:52,062
Motivations are everything, Will.

682
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,865
What did you see through the fog?

683
01:10:56,735 --> 01:11:00,569
I saw pretty clearly, didn't l?
I saw you take aim...

684
01:11:00,739 --> 01:11:03,799
-Forget it.
-...shoot your partner in the chest.

685
01:11:05,277 --> 01:11:08,610
I heard him say,
"Get away from me!" Why?

686
01:11:08,947 --> 01:11:12,280
Anything to do with
lnternal Affairs investigation?

687
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:15,147
All that tension in your department?

688
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:19,446
-You think I'm that easy?
-I'm saying that's how it looks.

689
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,493
Maybe even how it feels.

690
01:11:24,129 --> 01:11:30,534
How did it feel when you found
out it was Hap? Guilt? Relief?

691
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:36,601
Suddenly, you're free and clear. Did
you think about it before that moment?

692
01:11:37,075 --> 01:11:40,670
What would it be like
if he wasn't there anymore?

693
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:46,216
Doesn't mean you did it on purpose.

694
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:58,896
You figure if you got something on me,
then I'll just roll over?

695
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:02,260
-Protect my reputation?
-No.

696
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:04,465
Protect your life's work.

697
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:10,507
The scumbags you put away will be back
on the street before you go on trial.

698
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:15,045
With Hap gone, you're free and clear.
Why mess with that?

699
01:12:17,983 --> 01:12:21,248
Kay Connell. Remember her?

700
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:24,589
It's your choice.

701
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:28,625
Think of all the other Kay Connells.

702
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:33,321
Do the math. You're a pragmatist.
You have to be because of your job.

703
01:12:34,132 --> 01:12:37,295
This isn't easy,
but I want you to understand...

704
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:40,096
...we're in the same situation here.

705
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:45,042
You didn't mean to kill Hap
any more than I meant to kill Kay.

706
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:50,345
But that's hard for them to believe,
so that's why we need each other.

707
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:55,510
We gotta find a patsy for the
Connell case and make it stick.

708
01:12:56,254 --> 01:13:00,987
Then you go back to Los Angeles
and I can go back to living my life.

709
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:07,664
So, what do you need from me?

710
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:11,667
What do they know about me?

711
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:18,900
They found a signed copy of one
of your books at Kay's house.

712
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:23,513
-So you'll be brought in for questioning.
-At the station?

713
01:13:23,682 --> 01:13:26,173
That's what they usually do.

714
01:13:26,384 --> 01:13:30,081
Brought in for questioning.
I can write that easily.

715
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:35,521
Calm down. It's no big thing.
It's preliminary inquiry, so...

716
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:38,025
...just tell the truth.

717
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:43,033
-Tell them about Randy--
-Why are you talking about Randy?

718
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:48,365
Talk about your relationship with Kay.
You can't hide it, so just say it.

719
01:13:48,573 --> 01:13:52,771
Randy is none of your business.
It's not your affair.

720
01:13:52,978 --> 01:13:55,708
Shouldn't I tell them
she was unhappy--

721
01:13:55,914 --> 01:14:00,351
Tell them she was unhappy,
but let them find Randy themselves.

722
01:14:00,518 --> 01:14:03,385
That way, they'll make it stick.

723
01:14:03,588 --> 01:14:05,351
Understand?

724
01:14:06,424 --> 01:14:08,483
We need a wild card.

725
01:14:10,095 --> 01:14:14,464
-A wild card?
-Yeah. Something that's there.

726
01:14:14,633 --> 01:14:18,569
Something we can use.
It's in every good detective novel.

727
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:20,931
You still have the.38?

728
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,707
No.

729
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:27,609
Really? That's a shame.

730
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:32,175
We could use that.
That'd be very convincing for them.

731
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,419
This is my stop.

732
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,261
Dormer!

733
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:55,230
Wild card!

734
01:14:59,878 --> 01:15:02,472
-Night, everyone.
-Night, Francis.

735
01:15:03,615 --> 01:15:05,640
Working some overtime?

736
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:08,978
-Nice.
-Cracking some big cases?

737
01:15:09,487 --> 01:15:11,819
-Night.
-Night, guys.

738
01:15:58,169 --> 01:16:01,138
This is always the worst
time of night for me.

739
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:04,740
Too late for yesterday,
too early for tomorrow.

740
01:16:04,909 --> 01:16:08,868
Sorry about the tape.
I had to make sure you'd follow through.

741
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,411
I'll follow through.

742
01:16:10,582 --> 01:16:14,450
I've been thinking it over.
I should tell them about Randy.

743
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:19,690
-I think that's a bad idea.
-But he's the patsy. He deserves it.

744
01:16:19,891 --> 01:16:22,883
You should have heard
the shit Kay told me.

745
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:25,961
But these are cops.
They're not children.

746
01:16:26,131 --> 01:16:29,100
You don't throw things
like that in their lap.

747
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,325
I'll push them toward Randy.

748
01:16:31,536 --> 01:16:33,504
When the time is right.

749
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:38,040
We don't have the gun.
How will we convince them he's guilty?

750
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:40,302
Did you keep the dress?

751
01:16:40,912 --> 01:16:41,879
The dress?

752
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,675
Kay's dress, nail clippings.
What did you do with those?

753
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:50,412
That's great. The dress. We could
use that. Even better than the gun.

754
01:16:50,622 --> 01:16:54,183
-Where could he have taken her?
-Where'd you take her?

755
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,495
-She died in the cabin, right?
-Yeah.

756
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:00,323
Where'd you take her
to clean her up?

757
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:04,390
Don't think about that.
This is tough enough for you.

758
01:17:04,602 --> 01:17:06,467
-lt was an accident.
-Yeah.

759
01:17:06,638 --> 01:17:11,632
-I didn't mean to kill her, you know.
-I know, but what happened?

760
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:17,246
She called and said that
she and Randy had had a fight.

761
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:22,710
She wanted to come over and talk,
and I said, " Meet me at our place."

762
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:24,946
That's the cabin at the beach.

763
01:17:25,156 --> 01:17:29,092
She comes over.
She's distraught and a little drunk.

764
01:17:30,662 --> 01:17:34,928
She starts telling me about how Randy
and Tanya were carrying on.

765
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:40,232
I only wanted to comfort her.
Hold her.

766
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:47,776
I kissed her,
and got a little excited...

767
01:17:49,347 --> 01:17:52,111
...and she started laughing at me.

768
01:17:53,184 --> 01:17:55,778
She wouldn't stop laughing.

769
01:17:56,354 --> 01:18:00,984
Ever had someone laugh at you
when you're like that? Vulnerable.

770
01:18:01,192 --> 01:18:05,026
Laughing their ass off?
Someone you thought respected you?

771
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:07,828
You ever have that happen?

772
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:12,833
I just wanted to stop her laughing.
And then, you know...

773
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:14,638
...I hit her.

774
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:19,336
Couple of times, to stop her.
Get a little respect.

775
01:18:19,544 --> 01:18:23,105
Randy did it all the time.
She liked it when he did it.

776
01:18:23,314 --> 01:18:26,442
She never blamed him.
Never wanted to leave him.

777
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:30,018
I do it, she starts screaming.
She wouldn 't stop.

778
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:34,481
She' s screaming.
I put my hand over her mouth.

779
01:18:35,693 --> 01:18:39,026
Then l' m really scared.
I' m scared shitless.

780
01:18:39,197 --> 01:18:43,725
More scared than l' ve ever been.
I' m more scared than her.

781
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:45,493
And then...

782
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:49,071
...everything was clear.

783
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,108
There was no turning back.

784
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,710
And after that, I was calm.

785
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:00,709
Real calm.

786
01:19:04,355 --> 01:19:06,721
You and I share a secret.

787
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:10,620
We know how easy
it is to kill somebody.

788
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:16,962
That ultimate taboo.
It doesn't exist outside our minds.

789
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:19,303
I didn't murder her.

790
01:19:19,837 --> 01:19:23,898
I killed her,
but it just ended up that way.

791
01:19:24,842 --> 01:19:27,310
So where'd you take the body?

792
01:19:27,845 --> 01:19:29,608
Thanks for listening to me.

793
01:19:29,814 --> 01:19:34,444
Feels good to talk about that stuff.
I'll be able to sleep now.

794
01:19:35,153 --> 01:19:37,212
You wanna talk about Hap?

795
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,591
-Morning.
-Your phone isn't working.

796
01:19:51,803 --> 01:19:54,533
I turned it off.
I needed to sleep. Sorry.

797
01:19:54,739 --> 01:19:58,573
Fred called that author.
He was happy to cooperate.

798
01:19:58,743 --> 01:20:02,440
He'll be in first thing,
so we need to get to the office.

799
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:06,583
I forgot to tell you they sell these
in stores in Anchorage.

800
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:09,948
-No way of finding out who bought it.
-Okay.

801
01:20:10,154 --> 01:20:13,612
Bet you're looking forward
to getting back to L.A.

802
01:20:13,825 --> 01:20:16,385
Back to robbery homicide, or...

803
01:20:16,794 --> 01:20:18,694
...maybe not.

804
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:23,095
-What are you saying to me, Ellie?
-Nothing.

805
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:29,437
Are you doing okay?
You haven't been sleeping much.

806
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:32,075
No, I haven't. No.

807
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:40,740
A good cop can't sleep because
a piece of the puzzle's missing.

808
01:20:40,952 --> 01:20:44,149
A bad cop, because his
conscience won't let him.

809
01:20:45,123 --> 01:20:47,853
-You said that once.
-I did?

810
01:20:51,496 --> 01:20:54,522
Sounds like something
I'd say, don't it?

811
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,995
I'll see you back there.

812
01:21:03,474 --> 01:21:06,807
In what regard were you
and her familiar?

813
01:21:08,846 --> 01:21:12,577
-How did you know her?
-She was an avid reader of my novels.

814
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,752
When did you meet her first?

815
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:18,251
A year ago. She came
to a signing in Nightmute.

816
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:22,324
She hung around afterwards.
We chatted about my writing...

817
01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:24,859
...and how she wanted to write...

818
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:31,095
...then she asked if she could visit me
and talk about books, things like that.

819
01:21:31,302 --> 01:21:34,135
-And she did?
-Yeah, we became very close.

820
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:37,570
She got comfortable enough
to show me her writing.

821
01:21:37,775 --> 01:21:40,300
-What does she write?
-Poetry, actually.

822
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:42,911
-Any good?
-No, not really.

823
01:21:43,314 --> 01:21:46,943
-You tell her that?
-Why would l?

824
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:53,480
Exactly what was the nature of your
relationship to this girl, Finch?

825
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:58,321
I was someone she could talk to.
Someone outside of her everyday life.

826
01:21:58,763 --> 01:22:01,755
That's why she needed me
and approached me.

827
01:22:01,966 --> 01:22:04,161
Why'd she need you for that?

828
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:09,106
-Well, her boyfriend, Randy--
-Randy Stetz?

829
01:22:10,007 --> 01:22:14,467
-Abusive little prick. He hit her.
-We know all this already.

830
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,909
-lt was getting worse.
-So?

831
01:22:17,115 --> 01:22:18,605
A lot worse. Really.

832
01:22:18,816 --> 01:22:22,183
Why all this eagerness
to talk about Randy?

833
01:22:22,787 --> 01:22:26,223
You're right. I'm sorry.
That's probably all hearsay.

834
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,552
I don't want anything I say
taken the wrong way.

835
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,423
Anything you say to us
at this stage is in confidence.

836
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:38,227
Secondly, we're not a bunch of hotheads
who'll draw crazy conclusions.

837
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:40,996
-Okay.
-Please, continue.

838
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:46,838
One more thing. Probably doesn't
mean much, but I think Kay was scared.

839
01:22:47,078 --> 01:22:50,479
-I have myself to blame for that.
-Why is that?

840
01:22:51,182 --> 01:22:55,084
Randy knew who I was.
He knew that she had a friend...

841
01:22:55,253 --> 01:22:58,188
...someone she confided in.
It made him furious.

842
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:03,084
She wrote about being scared.
Her letters were getting desperate.

843
01:23:03,294 --> 01:23:06,263
You still have these letters,
by any chance?

844
01:23:06,464 --> 01:23:09,922
I probably do.
Do you think it might help?

845
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:11,768
They might.

846
01:23:13,971 --> 01:23:17,236
Okay. Anything else?

847
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:21,810
The thing that worried her
the most was the gun.

848
01:23:21,979 --> 01:23:25,278
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.

849
01:23:25,483 --> 01:23:29,180
I don't know where he got it,
probably wasn't even his...

850
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:33,619
...but he said he'd use it if he
found out who she was seeing.

851
01:23:33,824 --> 01:23:38,727
He kept it hidden in a heating vent.
You know, in the skirting boards?

852
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,760
It might be the.38.

853
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:47,164
-Get me Judge Biggs.
-What?

854
01:23:47,371 --> 01:23:50,135
I'm getting a search
warrant to Randy's.

855
01:23:50,341 --> 01:23:54,607
-Get Judge Biggs on the phone.
-I should get over there.

856
01:23:54,912 --> 01:23:56,174
-No!
-No?

857
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:02,114
You're the guy he's talking to.
So we're waiting for the warrant. Okay?

858
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:08,654
Do you know when Randy
showed her the gun?

859
01:24:08,893 --> 01:24:10,861
February?

860
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:14,088
No, probably January.

861
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:17,028
Why didn't you come
forward when she died?

862
01:24:17,235 --> 01:24:22,366
-She didn't want anybody to know.
-Even when she was dead?

863
01:24:22,673 --> 01:24:26,905
Beaten to death. Her body
dumped on a pile of garbage!

864
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:28,840
-I was her friend.
-No!

865
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:31,913
-Acquaintance. We were close--
-Close?

866
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:35,678
She was attractive.
Did you have sex with her?

867
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,787
-She was 1 7.
-Seventeen? She was attractive.

868
01:24:38,956 --> 01:24:40,048
I suppose.

869
01:24:40,258 --> 01:24:43,523
Suppose? She was.
So did you have sex with her?

870
01:24:43,728 --> 01:24:47,687
-No, I was her mentor.
-You bought her things. Gifts.

871
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:50,067
-Yes.
-What kind of gifts?

872
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:55,103
-Books, mostly, that's what she loved.
-Books? What about this?

873
01:24:55,373 --> 01:24:58,467
-You give her this?
-Yes.

874
01:24:59,143 --> 01:25:00,610
Why?

875
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:03,812
-To see how she looked with it on?
-No.

876
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:06,814
-No? Why jewelry?
-lt was just a present.

877
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:10,920
-Bought a lot of presents? Dresses?
-What's wrong with that?

878
01:25:11,088 --> 01:25:14,922
Nothing. I'm figuring out
what kind of mentor you were.

879
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:17,492
I gave her things she couldn't have.

880
01:25:17,662 --> 01:25:21,428
You wanted to fuck her, didn't you?
Sick son of a bitch!

881
01:25:23,467 --> 01:25:25,435
-Cool off.
-Sick bastard.

882
01:25:26,003 --> 01:25:28,870
You have to cool down. Okay?
Cool down.

883
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,635
All right. I need a break.

884
01:25:49,593 --> 01:25:52,756
I have to apologize
on behalf of my colleague.

885
01:25:53,264 --> 01:25:57,325
He's been under a lot of pressure
lately. But he's a good cop.

886
01:25:57,968 --> 01:26:01,062
I'd hate to see the bad cop.

887
01:26:06,277 --> 01:26:08,837
Search and seizure warrant.
Yes, sir.

888
01:26:09,046 --> 01:26:10,070
Randy Stetz.

889
01:26:23,794 --> 01:26:26,957
-We got our warrant!
-Thank you. We appreciate it.

890
01:26:39,543 --> 01:26:42,068
Francis, come with me. Let's go!

891
01:26:47,318 --> 01:26:49,252
-You're not going?
-No.

892
01:27:13,544 --> 01:27:15,774
Are you not on the Connell case?

893
01:27:16,046 --> 01:27:19,846
I'm covering the shooting
of Detective Dormer's partner.

894
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:21,415
Heard about that.

895
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:28,851
-Should I call about Kay's letters?
-Yeah. I'll pick them up.

896
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:55,180
Stetz! We're coming in!

897
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:14,262
Turn the place over.

898
01:28:24,748 --> 01:28:26,682
Look there! Try over there!

899
01:28:27,151 --> 01:28:29,278
Rich, look here now.

900
01:28:36,193 --> 01:28:37,956
I got it! Hey, Fred!

901
01:28:58,282 --> 01:29:01,718
-Just in time, Dormer.
-Had it in the motor oil.

902
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:06,154
What the fuck is this?

903
01:29:29,547 --> 01:29:32,573
He says he was with Tanya
when Kay was killed.

904
01:29:32,783 --> 01:29:35,047
-That's what she told me.
-When?

905
01:29:35,252 --> 01:29:38,813
-When I questioned her.
-Were you planning on telling us?

906
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:40,820
That's what I'm doing now.

907
01:29:46,764 --> 01:29:51,098
Randy and Tanya were screwing around.
She's trying to protect him.

908
01:29:51,268 --> 01:29:53,498
-And the gun?
-Says it isn't his.

909
01:29:53,704 --> 01:29:57,231
If we get the ballistics match,
he'll be forthcoming.

910
01:29:57,441 --> 01:29:59,500
-Leaving?
-First thing tomorrow.

911
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:03,009
If Spencer can remember
where he parked the plane.

912
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:32,935
I thought you wanted to kill me
in the interview room.

913
01:30:33,143 --> 01:30:37,079
-Randy is in jail.
-Said I'd write an ending they'd like.

914
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:39,272
You were wrapped up in details.

915
01:30:39,483 --> 01:30:42,452
-The details? He's innocent.
-No, he isn't.

916
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:45,589
He beat Kay.
One day he'd do something worse.

917
01:30:53,764 --> 01:30:55,561
You knew I planted the gun?

918
01:30:55,766 --> 01:30:58,792
You wanted to help me
before the tape recorder.

919
01:30:59,003 --> 01:31:01,233
You had to have a wild card.

920
01:31:01,438 --> 01:31:05,397
You're a good man. I know that,
even if you've forgotten it.

921
01:31:05,909 --> 01:31:11,279
When were you gonna point them
at me? When you found Kay's dress?

922
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:15,580
Where I took the body?
If you have a gun and forensics...

923
01:31:15,786 --> 01:31:20,223
...wouldn't matter what I said
about you killing your partner.

924
01:31:33,437 --> 01:31:35,632
May I have the tape?

925
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,781
-Did you make any other copies?
-Why would l?

926
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:49,245
Stop me from turning you in.

927
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,080
Or killing you.

928
01:31:51,288 --> 01:31:54,451
I don't have a hold over you.
You made choices.

929
01:31:54,658 --> 01:31:58,094
Like I wasn't here. Why kill me?
It won't help Randy.

930
01:31:58,295 --> 01:32:02,789
After your scene at the department,
it won't do you good if I'm dead.

931
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,596
-A lot of ways a man can die.
-Like an accident? Like Hap.

932
01:32:08,806 --> 01:32:10,137
Like Kay.

933
01:32:12,209 --> 01:32:16,077
It took you 1 0 minutes to beat
Kay Connell to death.

934
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:20,510
Ten fucking minutes.
You calling that an accident?

935
01:32:20,718 --> 01:32:24,484
It took you a fraction of a second
to kill your partner.

936
01:32:24,688 --> 01:32:26,918
Is that more of an accident?

937
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:31,117
Is this an accident?

938
01:32:34,998 --> 01:32:37,262
If you want it to be.

939
01:32:51,582 --> 01:32:53,743
It's over, Walt.

940
01:32:54,384 --> 01:32:59,412
It's over. I'm telling them everything.
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.

941
01:32:59,623 --> 01:33:02,615
-What good would that do?
-lt'll end this thing.

942
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:06,427
It won't end it.
You're not thinking straight.

943
01:33:06,597 --> 01:33:11,125
Will you tell the truth? You shot
your partner and lied about it.

944
01:33:11,435 --> 01:33:16,031
To them, you're a liar and a killer.
You're tainted. Forever!

945
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:21,701
You don't get to pick when you tell
the truth. The truth is beyond that.

946
01:33:22,813 --> 01:33:27,944
That tape was the only proof we had
a conversation outside of that room.

947
01:33:29,153 --> 01:33:31,747
To them, I'm a writer
that Kay admired.

948
01:33:31,955 --> 01:33:36,585
Randy is the killer, and you're a
hero cop. Your life's work is intact.

949
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:41,724
Another abusive scumbag is in jail.
Everything is as it should be.

950
01:33:41,932 --> 01:33:46,631
Go back to Los Angeles.
The case against Randy is pretty solid.

951
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:52,498
I can take care of everything here.
I got it worked out. Go home.

952
01:33:57,614 --> 01:34:01,675
Midnight of your sixth night.
You broke my record, Will.

953
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:44,392
-Randy Stetz. He was an asshole.
-You knew him as a kid?

954
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:48,019
-Dads were on the same boat.
-Bad seed.

955
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:50,491
How do you like our beer?

956
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,868
What Dormer needs
is a little shuteye.

957
01:34:59,076 --> 01:35:02,068
-White nights getting to you?
-Hasn't been easy.

958
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:04,679
-Better than winter.
-Got that right.

959
01:35:04,848 --> 01:35:09,945
-Sun barely comes up for five months.
-Like being sucked into a black hole.

960
01:35:10,754 --> 01:35:15,885
-Hey, Nancy Drew. You hear? We got him.
-Rich found the gun.

961
01:35:17,694 --> 01:35:21,152
-Something's on her mind.
-I found this on the beach.

962
01:35:21,365 --> 01:35:24,528
-What is it?
-Shell casing, 9mm.

963
01:35:25,602 --> 01:35:29,231
The murder weapon was a.38.
None of us carries a 9mm.

964
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:31,407
Or backup weapon, right?

965
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,305
Get a hobby, would you?

966
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,910
It's a legitimate point,
isn't it, detective?

967
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:48,891
This case is closed, Ellie. Hold the
fort, boys. I'll go find a men's room.

968
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:53,295
Relieve myself of your
fine Alaskan beer.

969
01:35:53,597 --> 01:35:55,690
Do you want a beer or something?

970
01:35:56,366 --> 01:35:57,958
No, thanks.

971
01:35:58,435 --> 01:36:02,735
-He's good people, right?
-Don't get carried away.

972
01:36:03,774 --> 01:36:06,504
What has two thumbs
and loves blowjobs?

973
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:09,008
-I don't know.
-This guy.

974
01:36:18,989 --> 01:36:21,116
It's been something, Dormer.

975
01:36:22,059 --> 01:36:25,051
It's been really great
working with you.

976
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:32,794
-Run Will to the airport?
-I gotta pick up the letters.

977
01:36:33,003 --> 01:36:34,095
In Umkumiut--

978
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:38,798
At his lake house. Dormer will
have to leave my car at the dock.

979
01:36:39,009 --> 01:36:42,604
-lf that's okay with you?
-Yeah, it's fine.

980
01:36:49,019 --> 01:36:50,987
It's been a pleasure.

981
01:36:51,188 --> 01:36:52,780
Get some sleep.

982
01:38:16,273 --> 01:38:17,831
Detective Dormer.

983
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:20,143
What is it?

984
01:38:20,343 --> 01:38:24,336
Someone's complaining about the noise.
Says he can't sleep.

985
01:38:25,115 --> 01:38:26,946
Something wrong?

986
01:38:28,919 --> 01:38:31,717
It's so fucking bright in here.

987
01:38:34,224 --> 01:38:36,283
No, it's dark in here.

988
01:38:41,264 --> 01:38:42,822
Will you please...?

989
01:38:57,314 --> 01:39:02,911
There's this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24.
Works part time at a copy store.

990
01:39:03,587 --> 01:39:06,920
Every day he watches
this 8-year-old boy...

991
01:39:07,124 --> 01:39:10,525
...waiting for his carpool
across the street.

992
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:15,097
-This is one of your cases?
-Yeah. Hap and me.

993
01:39:15,265 --> 01:39:16,732
A year and a half ago.

994
01:39:16,933 --> 01:39:19,561
For six months, he watches this kid.

995
01:39:19,769 --> 01:39:22,237
Finally gets up the nerve.

996
01:39:22,405 --> 01:39:26,000
He goes down, grabs that boy
before the carpool comes...

997
01:39:26,209 --> 01:39:29,269
...takes him back to his apartment...

998
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:33,310
...and keeps him there for three days.

999
01:39:34,451 --> 01:39:36,681
He tortures him...

1000
01:39:40,123 --> 01:39:42,114
...and makes him do things.

1001
01:39:42,325 --> 01:39:45,522
And, finally, he's had enough.
He gets a rope.

1002
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:50,428
He hangs the boy in a storage space
in the basement of the building.

1003
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:52,964
But he didn't do it right.

1004
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:58,902
Little boy's neck didn't break,
so he dangled there for a while...

1005
01:39:59,109 --> 01:40:02,078
...and then died finally
from the shock.

1006
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:06,113
Landlord found the body
five days later.

1007
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:10,245
The second I met this guy, Dobbs,
I knew he was guilty.

1008
01:40:10,487 --> 01:40:13,979
That's what I do. That's my job.
I assign guilt.

1009
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:16,125
You find the evidence...

1010
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:21,563
...figure out who did it, and then
you go get them and put them away.

1011
01:40:23,066 --> 01:40:29,494
This time there wasn't enough evidence.
And it's reasonable doubt to a jury...

1012
01:40:29,706 --> 01:40:34,143
...because a jury never
met a child murderer before.

1013
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:35,471
But I have.

1014
01:40:37,847 --> 01:40:38,973
Anyway....

1015
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,315
I went and took some blood samples
from the boy's dead body...

1016
01:40:49,859 --> 01:40:51,383
...and I planted them...

1017
01:40:54,764 --> 01:40:56,789
...in Dobbs' apartment.

1018
01:41:02,505 --> 01:41:04,063
I could feel it there.

1019
01:41:05,242 --> 01:41:07,733
This is gonna catch up with me.

1020
01:41:08,411 --> 01:41:12,871
-I don't do things like that.
-So how did it catch up with you?

1021
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:16,519
Internal Affairs is coming down
on our department.

1022
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:21,180
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...

1023
01:41:22,025 --> 01:41:24,755
...and bring me straight into it.

1024
01:41:25,028 --> 01:41:28,589
They would've reopened Dobbs' case,
he would've walked.

1025
01:41:28,798 --> 01:41:32,097
Now that won't happen.
And I don't know...

1026
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:35,198
...how I feel about that.

1027
01:41:36,973 --> 01:41:40,670
But Dobbs was guilty.
Dobbs needed to be convicted.

1028
01:41:40,877 --> 01:41:45,177
So the end justifies the means.

1029
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:48,212
Right?

1030
01:41:51,755 --> 01:41:55,316
-I'm in no position to judge.
-Why not?

1031
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:58,420
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.

1032
01:41:58,628 --> 01:42:03,895
The ones who are born here, and the
ones who come here to escape something.

1033
01:42:04,768 --> 01:42:06,395
I wasn't born here.

1034
01:42:07,237 --> 01:42:10,001
Why don't you tell me what you think?

1035
01:42:10,407 --> 01:42:14,707
Here. Now. In this room. You and me.

1036
01:42:15,645 --> 01:42:16,805
Please.

1037
01:42:20,917 --> 01:42:24,648
I guess it's about what you
thought was right at the time.

1038
01:42:26,656 --> 01:42:29,523
Then, what you're willing to live with.

1039
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,129
-Nightmute Police Department.
-Detective Burr.

1040
01:44:13,296 --> 01:44:17,494
She's not here. She left town
about 20 minutes ago to go pick up--

1041
01:44:42,425 --> 01:44:44,893
-Mr. Finch.
-Detective Burr.

1042
01:44:45,061 --> 01:44:46,961
-Are they friendly?
-Yeah.

1043
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:52,295
Didn' t expect to see you this soon.
Sorry about the mess, doing some work.

1044
01:45:05,482 --> 01:45:09,248
Could Kay's letters strengthen
the case against Randy?

1045
01:45:09,452 --> 01:45:10,612
Possibly.

1046
01:45:42,886 --> 01:45:45,081
Watch your head.
I've done it 1 000 times.

1047
01:45:52,195 --> 01:45:56,154
Sorry about all the clutter.
I am a pack-rat.

1048
01:45:57,534 --> 01:45:59,502
I keep everything.

1049
01:46:00,403 --> 01:46:02,701
I got them. Just don't know where.

1050
01:46:04,674 --> 01:46:08,633
-They've gotta be here somewhere.
-Working on a new book?

1051
01:46:08,845 --> 01:46:11,609
-Have you read any of my books?
-I haven't.

1052
01:46:52,956 --> 01:46:55,424
-She knows, Will.
-Where is she?

1053
01:46:55,592 --> 01:47:00,427
She knows you killed Hap. You would've
realized if you weren't strung out.

1054
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:03,360
-The way she looks at you--
-Where is she?

1055
01:47:03,566 --> 01:47:06,933
-It's under control.
-lf anything happened to her--

1056
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,103
She's okay.

1057
01:47:08,304 --> 01:47:13,503
If she talks, you're fucked. Everything
you've worked for is destroyed.

1058
01:47:15,645 --> 01:47:18,705
-Now give me--
-Show me where she is. Now.

1059
01:47:18,915 --> 01:47:23,113
She's okay.
Listen. I mean, it's all fine.

1060
01:47:26,289 --> 01:47:28,883
Let's search this place.
For the dress.

1061
01:47:29,092 --> 01:47:30,957
-What dress?
-Ellie's....

1062
01:47:31,427 --> 01:47:33,224
-Kay's!
-You're rambling.

1063
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:34,453
Ellie's here.

1064
01:47:34,664 --> 01:47:36,632
-I'm taking care of us.
-Us?

1065
01:47:37,066 --> 01:47:38,624
-She saw the dress.
-Us?

1066
01:47:38,835 --> 01:47:41,429
Where'd you get us?
Don't talk about us.

1067
01:47:41,638 --> 01:47:43,469
She's alive, Will. Ellie!

1068
01:48:14,337 --> 01:48:15,634
Hold it!

1069
01:48:17,807 --> 01:48:18,899
Don't move!

1070
01:48:19,575 --> 01:48:22,043
You shot Detective Eckhart.

1071
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,610
And Finch saw you do it.

1072
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,752
Did you mean to shoot Hap?

1073
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:36,188
I don't know anymore.

1074
01:48:38,361 --> 01:48:39,794
I don't know.

1075
01:48:42,465 --> 01:48:47,903
I couldn't see him through the fog,
but when I got up close...

1076
01:48:49,172 --> 01:48:51,436
...he was afraid of me...

1077
01:48:51,974 --> 01:48:56,502
...and he thought I meant to do it,
so maybe I did.

1078
01:49:00,049 --> 01:49:02,517
I just don't know anymore.

1079
01:49:18,735 --> 01:49:20,566
-Where's your gun?
-He took it.

1080
01:49:25,575 --> 01:49:27,338
Keep your head down.

1081
01:49:28,444 --> 01:49:32,642
I got seven rounds in this clip.
Make it last. Head down.

1082
01:49:36,686 --> 01:49:39,086
Okay, go! Go!

1083
01:50:35,178 --> 01:50:37,112
You forgot the wild card.

1084
01:51:51,988 --> 01:51:54,081
Detective Dormer!

1085
01:51:57,059 --> 01:52:02,520
I called for backup. They'll be
here soon. Dormer, just hold on.

1086
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:05,099
Hold on.

1087
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:15,805
Nobody needs to know.

1088
01:52:19,749 --> 01:52:23,344
You didn't mean to do it.
I know that even if you don't.

1089
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,782
No, don't. Don't.

1090
01:52:25,988 --> 01:52:27,785
What?

1091
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:30,618
Why?

1092
01:52:32,728 --> 01:52:35,253
Don't lose your way.

1093
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:42,904
Hang on.

1094
01:52:45,007 --> 01:52:46,440
Dormer.

1095
01:52:47,743 --> 01:52:49,438
Let me sleep.

1096
01:52:49,645 --> 01:52:51,579
No.

1097
01:52:52,581 --> 01:52:55,516
Just let me sleep.

1098
01:58:05,194 --> 01:58:06,161
