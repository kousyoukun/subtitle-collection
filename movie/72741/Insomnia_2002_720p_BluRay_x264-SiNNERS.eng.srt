1
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,881
There's just nothing down there.

2
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,384
I haven't seen a building in, like, 20 minutes.

3
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,138
- Look at that. - We're not on vacation, Hap.

4
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,474
Cheer up, will you?

5
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
Tell that to her, partner.

6
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,522
Better hang on, guys. It's gonna get rough.

7
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,977
Detective Eckhart, Detective Ellie Burr.

8
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,895
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.

9
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,438
How are you doing?

10
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,525
"Halibut fishing capital of the world." Okay.

11
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,070
Detective Dormer, it's an honor to meet you.

12
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,490
Welcome to Nightmute. I got the car right here.

13
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,631
It's so incredible to be working with you.

14
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,259
I've followed all of your cases:

15
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,720
Theodore Dineli, Frank Prud'homme...

16
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:50,517
...the Ocean Park shootings and especially the Leland Street murders.

17
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:55,063
Is that where Ronald Langley cut you, at 325 Leland Street?

18
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,940
You did your homework.

19
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,986
The Leland Street murders was my case study at the academy.

20
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,574
- I'll take you to the Lodge and... - No, take us to the station.

21
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,202
Right. We need to get started.

22
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,830
Most homicides are solved in the first 72 hours.

23
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,834
Well, it's 48 hours. We're a day behind.

24
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,045
But who's counting?

25
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,598
Yeah, come in.

26
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,038
They got you behind a desk, huh? 

27
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,311
Charlie Bubbles. How you doing?

28
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,148
- I haven't seen you since when? - Hey, Charlie.

29
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,942
- Seven years? - Eight.

30
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,571
Seven years! I am old. Ellie, get everyone in the bullpen.

31
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,824
- Nice kid. - Loves the job.

32
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,953
When I called Buck for advice on this,

33
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,873
I never expected he'd send you up here.

34
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,920
- Something about Internal Affairs? - They're moving in.

35
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,610
It's nothing. It's the usual crap.

36
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,133
Buck figured you could use some help...

37
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,845
They got Finn and Kentor on Narcotics.

38
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,597
The fuckers are looking for headlines...

39
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,018
- It's gonna blow over. - Got a message from Warfield.

40
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,770
I.A.'s pit bull.

41
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,107
He wants to be posted on your movements.

42
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,901
You'll find us more straightforward.

43
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:28,031
Good guys, bad guys, but a lot less public relations. It's simple.

44
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,077
Except for this.

45
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,748
Okay, listen up. Detectives Dormer and Eckhart...

46
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,002
...on loan from Buck Lundgard, L.A. Homicide.

47
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,462
They'll help with the Connell case.

48
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,194
Anything they want to see, show them.

49
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:47,718
Anyplace they want to go, take them.

50
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,388
This is Fred Duggar. He's heading the investigation.

51
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,599
- A pleasure. - Want to get on it?

52
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,226
- Seen what we got? - Let's start with the body.

53
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,313
- You got the report? - I want to see for myself.

54
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,861
Herniation of the brain stem due to intracerebral hemorrhage.

55
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,573
- Beaten to death. - These contusions?

56
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:14,244
Superficial. Most of the trauma was to her face and neck.

57
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,956
- Any signs of rape? - No.

58
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:22,586
- This one covers an older bruise. - There's an older one here.

59
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,715
- They're both in the report. - He washed her hair.

60
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,431
Scrubbed her nails.

61
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,893
It's all in the report.

62
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,147
- Doesn't say he clipped them. - She could have clipped them.

63
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,859
Nope. No polish on the ends of the nails. See?

64
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,448
She painted them herself. Someone else cut them. Toes too.

65
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,300
Naked when found?

66
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,787
Yeah. Last seen wearing a red dress.

67
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,872
No fibers, flakes, hairs?

68
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,252
We know about forensics work here. The body gave us nothing.

69
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:09,758
She gave us plenty. All this trouble, all this care. Why?

70
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:16,723
- He knew her. - He knows we can connect him to her.

71
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,852
This isn't a random psycho? Crime of passion?

72
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:25,482
Maybe. But whatever happened, his reaction wasn't passionate.

73
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,027
He didn't panic. Didn't chop her up or burn her.

74
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,115
He just thought about what we would be looking for...

75
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:37,452
...and then calmly removed all those traces.

76
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,664
No haste. No rush.

77
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:44,042
Why clip the nails after scrubbing them?

78
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,546
Manipulating the body. Prolonging the moment.

79
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,798
No mutilation.

80
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,550
Not this time.

81
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,387
- You think there's been others? - No.

82
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,308
But there's gonna be. This guy...

83
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,062
...he crossed the line and he didn't even blink.

84
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,357
You don't come back from that.

85
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,612
Okay. Let's go find out who Kay was.

86
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,912
Fred said not to touch anything, so I haven't tidied up.

87
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,707
She hates it when I go into her room anyway.

88
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,753
Thank you, Mrs. Connell.

89
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,848
So she went to a party Friday night.

90
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:44,770
Not exactly a party. It's a local dive where the kids hang out.

91
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,146
No diary?

92
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,816
We didn't find one. Her mom said she has a journal.

93
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,529
Friends said she argued with her boyfriend Friday.

94
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,615
She stormed off just after midnight.

95
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,117
She did, huh?

96
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,329
This is interesting.

97
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,552
Who is this?

98
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,138
Tanya Francke, Kay's best friend.

99
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,766
I want to talk to her.

100
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,019
Who is Kay Connell? Who is she?

101
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,022
Is she popular or is she a Ioner?

102
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:33,402
Did she like this town? She want to bolt first chance she got?

103
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,404
Did she have dreams?

104
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,000
She knew this guy.

105
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,408
We know her, maybe we can know him.

106
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,744
This is designer. This is expensive.

107
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,665
- The boyfriend, Randy. - Randy Stetz.

108
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,293
- He could afford this? - He's in school.

109
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,712
- Mom didn't buy it. - What are we thinking?

110
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,215
I don't know, stepfather? Any rich uncles?

111
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,717
No.

112
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,179
An admirer.

113
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,640
Yeah.

114
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,645
- I want the boyfriend. - I'll get him to the station.

115
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,774
I want to go to the school. Pull him out in front of friends.

116
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,695
Catch him off guard. It will get people talking.

117
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,823
So how far away is the school?

118
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,413
- It's 10:00, Detective Dormer. - You bet.

119
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,916
At night.

120
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,753
So when does it get dark here?

121
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,171
It doesn't.

122
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,591
Not this time of year.

123
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,095
Yeah, I heard about that. How come you didn't know that, Hap?

124
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,315
- Lower 48. - Lower 48?

125
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,943
Not from here. Can tell by your walk.

126
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,737
- How's that? - Unsure.

127
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,823
Dormer and Eckhart. We have a reservation.

128
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,430
Don't be fooled by my friend's frivolous demeanor.

129
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,828
He's all business.

130
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,750
- Your restaurant still serving? - Kitchen's about to close.

131
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,294
We'll be quick. Thank you.

132
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,712
Thanks.

133
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,926
We got the Halibut Calabrese, got the Halibut Olympian.

134
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,470
- Keep going. - Halibut Cajun style.

135
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,932
I can't wait to see what they got for dessert.

136
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,978
Natives are getting restless.

137
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,897
- We gotta talk. - No, we don't.

138
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,316
- Just sit tight? - Nothing's changed.

139
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,693
Nothing's changed?

140
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,614
What do you think we're doing in the halibut capital of the world?

141
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,825
Buck figured Charlie needed help.

142
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:49,705
Buck figured I.A. would be coming to me next, and he was right.

143
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,751
Warfield had me in his office for three hours yesterday.

144
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,464
Hap, he's rattling your cage, pal. That's all.

145
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:05,095
Me and Trish talked it through, and I'm sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

146
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,807
- Don't say this shit to me. - You won't be involved.

147
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,976
I'm not? Of course I will.

148
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,854
With your reputation, he can't touch you.

149
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,773
My reputation's the whole problem.

150
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:24,114
You think Warfield gives a fuck about you shaking down drug dealers?

151
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,744
You think that will get him his headlines? He needs the big fish.

152
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,164
He's putting the squeeze on you to get to me.

153
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,043
- But you're clean, Will. - I'm a good cop, yeah.

154
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:41,590
But there's always something they could use to get at your credibility.

155
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,343
Have you any idea what this is gonna do?

156
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,199
Think about all my cases.

157
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,848
All the cases dependent on my word, my judgment.

158
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,602
Those fuckers on the street. That's what you're doing.

159
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,314
They got nothing on you because there's nothing to get.

160
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,608
Dobbs.

161
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,196
- What about Dobbs? - That's different.

162
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,614
It's different?

163
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,575
Warfield doesn't want Dobbs on the street.

164
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,244
It's a house of cards. Once it starts,

165
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,705
it's just gonna tumble. All of it.

166
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,375
That's a chance I gotta take, pal.

167
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,169
- I got family. - Don't give me that.

168
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,297
Warfield made it clear. I get probation.

169
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,593
We're cops, man. This is not about us.

170
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,348
This is about all the people who depend on us. People with families.

171
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,685
I spent my life doing this. My life.

172
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:39,606
You're gonna destroy it like that. Why? Why?

173
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,485
So some I.A. prick gets closer to being chief of police?

174
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,446
Or playing golf with the mayor

175
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,241
or whatever the fuck else he's after?

176
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,702
You finished?

177
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,249
Sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

178
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,712
So, make any decisions?

179
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,466
- You do everything around here? - After 11, pretty much.

180
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,512
Over to you, Will. What are you having?

181
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,147
I lost my appetite.

182
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,737
Excuse me.

183
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,428
Morning.

184
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:13,450
- What kind of calls you get here? - Mostly drinking-related problems.

185
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,454
Domestic abuse, bar fights, that sort of stuff.

186
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:21,291
People here come to live the way they want to...

187
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,919
...so most people keep to themselves.

188
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,965
Chief won't let me handle anything over a misdemeanor.

189
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,883
Don't knock misdemeanors.

190
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,262
No, but it's such small stuff. It's so boring.

191
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:37,933
It's all about small stuff. You know, small lies, small mistakes.

192
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,981
People give themselves away same in misdemeanors as in murder cases.

193
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:48,735
It's just human nature. Aren't you gonna write that down?

194
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,095
Friends making you nervous? They think you did it?

195
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,223
You killed her?

196
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,352
- No smoking on the school premises. - Did you love her?

197
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,816
- Randy, did you love her? - Sure, she was nice.

198
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:33,113
She was nice. Wow. That makes me all soft inside.

199
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,866
Did it occur to you she didn't love you?

200
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,951
She loved me.

201
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,580
- Wanted me every night. - Probably to pass the time.

202
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,750
Girl like Kay Connell,

203
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,753
she was looking for more than some loser. Right?

204
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,130
What can I say? Love is blind.

205
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,090
- Live on your own? - His grandpa's.

206
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,219
- No alibi for Friday? - Didn't know I'd need one.

207
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,699
At the party what'd you fight about?

208
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,014
Stuff. No big deal.

209
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,434
- I heard it was a loud fight. - I guess.

210
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:05,854
- I heard it was pretty rough. - It wasn't rough.

211
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:11,068
Not like the other times. Those times she wouldn't listen to you.

212
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,529
Couldn't keep her mouth shut.

213
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,157
- Keep fishing, man. - We saw the bruises.

214
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,409
They said she was beaten.

215
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,747
Not those bruises. Come on. The old bruises. Your bruises.

216
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:27,376
I'm sick of this. I haven't done anything wrong.

217
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,127
You haven't?

218
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,588
Fuck you!

219
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,884
You're a prick in a leather jacket. What the fuck do you know?

220
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,303
Randy...

221
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,480
...this whole thing you're doing, this fuck-the-world act.

222
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,860
It might work with your mom. It might even work with local cops...

223
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,613
...who know you enough to figure you're too dumb to kill...

224
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:00,701
...without leaving witnesses and a signed confession.

225
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,328
It ain't gonna work with me.

226
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:08,542
Because I know things. You understand?

227
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,421
I know you beat your girlfriend.

228
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,340
I know she was seeing somebody else.

229
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:21,638
Someone she might have gone to see after she walked out on you Friday.

230
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,976
Now are you gonna tell us who that somebody might be?

231
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,021
Or are you so fucking stupid...

232
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:34,902
...you're gonna leave yourself as the last person to see Kay Connell alive?

233
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,781
I don't know.

234
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,742
You don't know.

235
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,328
I couldn't get her to tell me.

236
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,298
How hard did you try?

237
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,843
Pretty hard.

238
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,072
- You think he... - No.

239
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,616
How'd it go? Find where this is from.

240
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,744
Mrs. Connell and her friends don't know.

241
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:30,541
You try the jewelry stores? Small things, remember?

242
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,920
The second you're about to dismiss something, think about it.

243
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,214
Look at it again.

244
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,759
Want me to write that down?

245
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,345
No, I'll remember it.

246
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,567
- Where was it? - In a cabin on the beach.

247
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,902
- It's Kay's? - Her books are in it.

248
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,904
- Kids found it. - Cabin secured?

249
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,323
- Francis is headed there. - Stop him.

250
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,742
- Tell him to stay clear. - Rich.

251
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,412
Biology and Algebra.

252
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,166
Let's find out who she studied with, where she bought this.

253
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,338
"Otherwise Engaged. A J. Brody mystery."

254
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,591
- Who reads this crap? - I do.

255
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,510
Read it. After it's dusted.

256
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,950
Find anything that strikes you,

257
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,223
plot-wise, underlined passages.

258
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,933
There it is. The diary.

259
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,393
Every word.

260
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,606
That's it.

261
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,691
- I'll put it in evidence. - No.

262
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,151
Why?

263
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,779
Call every radio station from here to Anchorage.

264
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:47,367
Tell them we're looking for the bag Kay left the party with.

265
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,996
- Get it on the air in the next hour. - You got it.

266
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:54,583
Fill that bag up with books and put it back.

267
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,214
Gonna eat this son of a bitch alive, knowing he missed this.

268
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:07,930
You know something, Charlie? Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

269
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:11,183
A guy picks up a bag, don't make him guilty.

270
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,559
Will, it's solid.

271
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:17,981
I don't know. This kind of thing. Maybe we do this by the numbers.

272
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,776
- Come on. - I.A.'s gonna be on my ass.

273
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:25,656
I don't want this turning up in some court when my rep's in the shit...

274
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,825
...and they're pulling apart my cases. - Bullshit.

275
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,703
What the fuck you care?!

276
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,295
Someone beat a girl to death. Your job is to find him.

277
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,777
You're a cop, not a lawyer.

278
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,092
Don't let I.A. cut your balls off.

279
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,970
Charlie's right, Will.

280
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:10,325
OP 1, this is OP 2. We still got nothing.

281
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,536
Yeah, it's nice. Light.

282
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:15,998
All plastic except for the barrel. Never rusts.

283
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,500
What do you carry down in L.A.?

284
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,794
- Smith & Wesson.45. - Excellent.

285
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,921
- Anything? - No.

286
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,390
Maybe he doesn't listen to the radio.

287
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,226
He prefers the voices in his head.

288
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,063
Hey, Will?

289
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,119
We have somebody moving towards the cabin.

290
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,664
Okay, fan out. Nice and easy.

291
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,507
Shit.

292
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:07,758
Come on, go!

293
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,446
Police!

294
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,242
Police! Come out!

295
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,961
Fuck!

296
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,422
Down there, huh?

297
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,634
Down to the water. Spread out!

298
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:51,969
Go!

299
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,265
Fuck it.

300
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,518
Dormer!

301
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,618
Hold it! Who's there?

302
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,415
- You okay? - I'm okay.

303
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,344
- Will? - Don't talk.

304
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,638
- Will. - Don't talk. Don't talk.

305
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,433
- Here. - You sh...

306
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,809
You...

307
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:47,936
You shot...

308
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:52,149
I know. I couldn't see, Hap. I couldn't see in the fog.

309
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,484
You tried to...

310
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,321
You tried to kill me? Fuck you.

311
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,364
No, listen, Hap.

312
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:03,493
- Listen to me now. No, no. - Get away, get away!

313
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,164
No, I couldn't see you in the fog. I couldn't. l...

314
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,750
I couldn't see you, Hap.

315
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,544
Don't go. Come on.

316
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,817
- Man down! - Who's down?

317
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:43,242
- Man down here! - Spread out!

318
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:51,166
Dormer! Where'd he go? Which way?

319
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,378
Dormer! Which way?

320
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,463
That way.

321
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,924
Fuck.

322
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,937
You gave chase.

323
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:17,067
After you left Farrell, you heard the killer's second shot.

324
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:21,029
You ran down to the water. You found Hap.

325
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,032
Will?

326
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,994
Is that what happened?

327
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,832
- Did Hap say anything? - Damn it!

328
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,252
Why didn't I know about the goddamn tunnel?

329
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:40,132
You don't move on a suspect without knowing his exits.

330
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,302
There's a bunch of those tunnels out there.

331
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:46,013
Closed years ago when they were mines.

332
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,143
- I don't even know most of them myself. - I had him, Charlie.

333
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,605
As close as you are now.

334
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,858
I could smell the son of a bitch.

335
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:03,614
- And I blew it. - There's no point in blaming yourself.

336
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,720
I fucked up everything.

337
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,952
Don't come apart on me, understand?

338
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,122
I need you to find this bastard.

339
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,166
Yeah.

340
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:19,129
- You wanted to see me? - You're on Eckhart's shooting.

341
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,300
But we know what happened, and I'm on the Connell case.

342
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,719
Anchorage wants to send someone.

343
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,971
I told them we can do it. Can't we?

344
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,974
- Sure. - Write it up. No Shakespeare.

345
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:35,187
Just enough to fry this son of a bitch longer. Right?

346
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,482
Hello?

347
00:31:54,373 --> 00:32:00,128
Jenny, it's Will. Can you put your mother on?

348
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,867
Hello?

349
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:08,011
Trish, it's Will.

350
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:11,841
What's happened? They won't tell me anything.

351
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,142
It's Hap...

352
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:17,308
Is he okay?

353
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,276
No, he's gone, Trish.

354
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,902
He's dead.

355
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,756
What?

356
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,912
Trish, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

357
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:36,595
What was he doing, Will?

358
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:42,671
This guy killed a girl, and, so we...

359
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,799
We had him...

360
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:50,512
We found him and we had him cornered. And then he ran and...

361
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,389
Hap...

362
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:56,226
I'm so sorry.

363
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,062
- I'm just so sorry. - Did he suffer?

364
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:04,818
- No, I don't... - Did he say anything?

365
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:14,912
Well, when I found him he...

366
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,414
He was peaceful.

367
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:22,628
- Did you get him? - No, no. Not yet.

368
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:24,810
You find him.

369
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:27,788
And when you do, don't arrest him.

370
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:31,391
You understand me, Will Dormer?

371
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,425
Don't you dare fucking arrest him!

372
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,769
- Okay, Trish. - You understand?

373
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,312
Okay.

374
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,983
Trish, listen.

375
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,818
I'm...

376
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,523
- was shot and killed this evening...

377
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:09,579
... in an attempt to apprehend a suspect in the murder...

378
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:13,420
... of 17-year-old local girl, Kay Connell.

379
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,619
I'm sorry. It's been on the radio for hours.

380
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,372
We're not used to this kind of stuff up here.

381
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,754
He was standing right there. Last night.

382
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,759
I hope I was nice to him.

383
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,053
He liked you.

384
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,939
Detective? I'm sorry to bother you, but could you just point...

385
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,776
...to where you were when you heard the second shot?

386
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,112
Sorry to make you do this right now.

387
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:02,074
That's all right. You're doing your job.

388
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,367
Where was I?

389
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,369
- There. - Thank you.

390
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,664
No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh?

391
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,209
No, we'll have the other one for ballistics after...

392
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,795
...the autopsy.

393
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,507
I'm really sorry.

394
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,349
- Clean through, huh? - Yeah.

395
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:30,227
Bullet got lost in the rocks, I guess.

396
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,313
Well, better luck next time.

397
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,274
You ever been shot?

398
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,402
Yeah, I have. Kind of itches, don't it?

399
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:42,865
We gotta catch him. Did you get a look at him?

400
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,159
- When? - When I left you.

401
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,246
- You see anything? - I was in a lot of pain...

402
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:54,001
...and when I heard that second shot, I kept my goddamn head down.

403
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,752
Hey, I'm...

404
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,422
...sorry about Detective Eckhart.

405
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,841
Sorry about that megaphone.

406
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,969
- Maybe if I hadn't... - Farrell, listen.

407
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,264
What were we doing running around in the fog?

408
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:11,435
We doing it for our health? We were chasing someone.

409
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:16,064
So anything that happened on that beach is not your fault.

410
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:19,443
That's the fault of one man and one man only.

411
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:23,030
And that's the man who beat Kay Connell to death.

412
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,289
At this point, Dormer encountered Brooks.

413
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:36,043
The suspect, obscured by fog, shot Officer Brooks...

414
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,879
...in the vastus externus of the left thigh.

415
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,924
You're Farrell. You were shot in the leg.

416
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,258
Come on, Ellie.

417
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,469
When you get this, get the cone.

418
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,515
- This his blood? - Ketchup maybe.

419
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:52,267
Was he eating a hot dog?

420
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:58,106
Anything he dropped...

421
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:01,735
...you put in a bag.

422
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:05,781
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, coins, anything.

423
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,992
Suspect will often leave something behind.

424
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,911
Detective Dormer...

425
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,666
...Iost the suspect in the fog then heard a shot...

426
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,502
...coming from a northeasterly direction.

427
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,880
- He wasn't that way. - How do you know?

428
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,091
Because I saw him.

429
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,678
- Turn this way. - Are we almost done here?

430
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,847
My nads are freezing off.

431
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,632
Ellie! I think I found something.

432
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:36,353
- Should they start further over? - No.

433
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,273
He stayed by the water far as he could.

434
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:44,236
I saw him over the rocks. He knew he'd lose us down there.

435
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,365
Duggar.

436
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:51,577
Where'd he find it?

437
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,036
Okay.

438
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,540
Yeah, well, just let me know.

439
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,501
Okay.

440
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,378
I will.

441
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,050
Dormer?

442
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:11,513
They found Farrell's bullet. Looks like a.38.

443
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,933
We'll get both bullets to the lab.

444
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:19,146
See if we can get a fix on the weapon. If it's okay with you.

445
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,651
A guy came by. Said he was your new partner.

446
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,737
- Did he leave a name? - No.

447
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:30,699
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

448
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,202
- Pioneer Lodge. - Warfield for Dormer.

449
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:36,079
John Warfield. He's called a couple times.

450
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,417
Want me to lie?

451
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:43,170
No, I'll take it.

452
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,256
Thank you.

453
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,112
Dormer here.

454
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:54,784
I was shocked to hear about your partner. I was getting to know him...

455
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:56,223
What do you want?

456
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,230
You know what I want, Eckhart was gonna give it to me.

457
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,958
You got something to say, just say it.

458
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:06,367
- He told you about our conversation? - Say it.

459
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:12,490
Let's just say I'm interested to see your report on what happened.

460
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:15,035
Don't presume to know what happened.

461
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:18,872
You weren't here. But then, you never are, are you?

462
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:23,836
You're always safe behind some desk, reading your bullshit reports.

463
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:28,382
And that is why I have nothing but contempt for you.

464
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:32,010
You and all the assholes like you...

465
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:37,391
...risk nothing, spend all day sucking the marrow out of real cops...

466
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,562
...when you never had the balls to be one yourself.

467
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:08,667
- Detective, you came yourself. - Yeah.

468
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,503
Sign here.

469
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,222
He didn't suffer too much.

470
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,101
- What's the caliber? - Don't know.

471
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:30,606
The gunshot victims I see are from rifles. Wasn't one of those.

472
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:35,903
- Had any sleep, detective? - Yeah.

473
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:04,932
- What the hell is wrong with you? - Sorry.

474
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:10,687
No problem.

475
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:15,025
- Bullet. I want results by tomorrow. - Aye, aye, cap'n.

476
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:18,028
We should check Randy's whereabouts.

477
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,030
Think it was Randy out there?

478
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:24,159
He still doesn't have an alibi. You said he beat Kay.

479
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:27,037
- You check it out, then. - I will.

480
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,233
Detective Dormer?

481
00:46:58,402 --> 00:46:59,987
My report. I finished.

482
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:02,906
I need you to look it over and sign it.

483
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,472
It's self-explanatory.

484
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:09,204
I look forward to getting back to work with you.

485
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:13,166
We have more important things to do than paperwork.

486
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:25,137
A man died, Ellie. This is important.

487
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,807
Of course. I didn't mean to imply that that wasn't...

488
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:32,019
Be sure of your facts before you file this.

489
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,898
It's your name on the report.

490
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:51,348
He couldn't have come from there.

491
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:06,071
Dormer here.

492
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:11,410
- Hello? - Can't sleep, Will?

493
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:13,432
Me neither.

494
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,414
Who's this?

495
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:19,563
I got a nap this afternoon, but I guess you had to work.

496
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:21,807
Who am I speaking to?

497
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:24,138
Get rid of your clock yet? Won't help.

498
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:28,212
When I moved here, I went five nights. You believe that?

499
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:32,131
- This crazy light. - A name or I'm gonna hang up.

500
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:34,442
No, you're not. You need the company.

501
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:36,752
Nothing as lonely as not sleeping.

502
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,825
Feels like the whole fucking planet is deserted. Just you and me.

503
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:44,401
So...

504
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:48,822
...tell me who I'm talking to, and we can chat a while.

505
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,824
- I can't do that. - Why not?

506
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:54,039
- Not till you understand some things. - Like what?

507
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,467
I saw.

508
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,628
- Saw what? - Saw you shoot your partner.

509
00:50:02,629 --> 00:50:06,915
Saw him die in your arms on that beach.

510
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,851
I thought you'd blame me. That's why I dropped my gun.

511
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,389
- My uncle's old.38. - Yeah.

512
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:18,435
- You get it? What about ballistics? - Listen to me now.

513
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:22,105
I don't know what you think you saw.

514
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:25,768
We should discuss this, don't you think? Face to face.

515
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:29,330
This situation isn't yours to control. I saw you.

516
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:33,075
I'll control this situation, pal.

517
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:38,063
Because you don't hide from me in a town this small. Get it?

518
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:39,844
No, not for long.

519
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:43,817
I need your help. I'm not telling anyone anything.

520
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:46,478
We're partners on this.

521
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:24,793
- but to be remembered as the Kay we knew and loved.

522
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:28,505
Swimming, hiking through the Kebaughs...

523
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,466
...meeting at Darrow's after school...

524
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:37,097
...and always, always with a smile on her face.

525
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,184
Detective Dormer?

526
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:45,939
I want to check something. I was going over my report last night...

527
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:50,360
...and I have a question about where that second shot came from.

528
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:53,655
You said you heard it from the waterline...

529
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:57,326
...but from the way Detective Eckhart's body fell...

530
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:02,247
...it couldn't have come from the rocks further up from the water.

531
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:08,378
Do you think it's possible you heard the shot before you hit the waterline?

532
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,466
- Detective Dormer? - Yeah, it's possible.

533
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,801
Yeah.

534
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,935
Why don't I give her a ride?

535
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:27,022
- Thought I smelled something. - How you doing? Coping?

536
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,815
- You're that cop. - Yeah.

537
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:32,903
- Are you coming or not? - Not.

538
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:35,656
Hey.

539
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:47,334
You want a stick of gum? I love chewing gum.

540
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:50,546
It keeps me awake.

541
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:54,000
I never met anyone from L.A. before.

542
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,884
Not missing much.

543
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:59,680
- So how do you like our shithole town? - It's not bad.

544
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,621
Were you good friends with Kay?

545
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,769
Best friends. Since grade school.

546
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:09,231
- That's a long time. - Yeah, we were like sisters.

547
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:13,402
Like sisters? Must be tough for you what happened, then.

548
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:17,573
Everyone keeps telling me I'm doing great, considering.

549
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,492
But they're all real worried about me.

550
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:24,162
They don't even care if I show up for school or not.

551
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,707
Worried I haven't cried yet.

552
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:30,419
But ain't no law says you gotta cry, right?

553
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:32,296
No, there ain't.

554
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:39,803
What about her other friends?

555
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:45,601
Do we have to talk about Kay right now? God.

556
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:49,021
I don't want to think about all that. Just drive.

557
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:51,106
I understand.

558
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:56,904
- Want me to take you somewhere? - As long as it's fun.

559
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,865
Young, impressionable girl...

560
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:02,451
...left alone with older Los Angeles cop.

561
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,870
Who knows where we might go?

562
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,497
Well, I know a place.

563
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:12,461
Let's just drift a while.

564
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,255
Look at this.

565
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:17,299
Who does he think he is?

566
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,302
What does he think he's doing?

567
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,888
- Move over. - Let him move over.

568
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,389
Come on! Move over!

569
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,185
What are you doing? Move over, you crazy fuck!

570
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,194
Just a little visit to the dump!

571
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,342
You should feel at home.

572
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,324
You just about killed us! Get off me!

573
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:45,994
- What is this? - You and Kay were like sisters?

574
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:50,499
- Yes. I told you. - Why are her pictures of you torn?

575
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:55,295
Why was her boyfriend's hands all over your ass at her funeral?

576
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:59,007
Randy doesn't have an alibi because he was with you.

577
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:03,095
You were out fucking your best friend's boyfriend.

578
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:05,410
That what best friends do?

579
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,558
She never really loved Randy, okay?

580
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,518
- She didn't love him? - No.

581
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:13,188
How do you figure that? She have someone else?

582
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:17,025
- I don't know. - Someone bought her dresses, jewelry?

583
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,986
Hey, look around.

584
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:21,363
I want to show you something.

585
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:23,574
You'll understand why I brought you.

586
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,704
This is the spot where your best friend's naked body was dumped.

587
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:32,082
Wrapped up in garbage bags!

588
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,753
Tanya...

589
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:42,509
...I know you don't want anyone knowing you betrayed your best friend.

590
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:47,181
That's why you won't give Randy an alibi for Friday night. I know.

591
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,432
Tell me who Kay was seeing.

592
00:55:49,432 --> 00:55:51,518
And we can forget the whole thing.

593
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:55,856
It'd be our secret. Our little secret, but I need a name.

594
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:58,108
She wouldn't tell me, okay?

595
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,612
She wouldn't tell you? You're her best friend.

596
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,823
- It was her big fucking secret! - Why a secret?

597
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:08,994
I don't... Because she thought she was special...

598
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,165
...and she kept saying he'd help her get out of here.

599
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:15,209
- Who is "he"? - I don't know.

600
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,085
- She talked about him? - Yeah.

601
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:18,962
- She talked to you? - Yeah.

602
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,590
And what did she call him?

603
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:25,052
- She called him something, right? - Yes!

604
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,721
What? What'd she call him?

605
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,724
Brody.

606
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:36,230
She called him Brody. That's not his name, so what's the difference?

607
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:41,401
Jesus! You happy now, you fucking asshole?

608
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,911
Okay. You did good. Come on. I'll let you drive.

609
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,508
It's just poetry. I read it line by line.

610
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:10,097
It's nothing specific. Verses on nature, love. That sort of stuff.

611
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:12,891
Detective Dormer. Line one.

612
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:16,186
- Dormer here. - How're you holding up?

613
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:20,377
Can't be easy to keep working after three days of no sleep.

614
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:22,448
And hard to keep focus.

615
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:24,587
Are you seeing things yet?

616
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:28,690
You know, those little flashes? Tricks of light?

617
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,085
See your partner?

618
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,148
- I see Kay sometimes. - What can I do for you, sir?

619
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,168
Why couldn't you tell anyone you shot him?

620
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:43,469
I mean, it was an accident, right?

621
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,200
I hope so. For your sake. You know what I'm saying?

622
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,201
No need for threats.

623
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:52,677
I'm trying to make you understand my situation.

624
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:57,252
You thought no one would believe you because of the trouble in L.A.

625
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,718
I know what that's like, Will.

626
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:04,318
- I got the same problem. - You do?

627
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:07,622
I'm not who you think I am.

628
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,489
- You're not? - No.

629
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:13,952
I'm not a murderer any more than you.

630
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:16,079
Why don't we get together?

631
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:18,290
Talk, have a beer, whatever?

632
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,334
Throw a little gas on the fire?

633
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,002
Yeah...

634
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:37,309
I gotta go check some things. Why don't you...

635
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,562
...put this stuff back into evidence and tell...

636
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,397
- What's that guy? - Fred.

637
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:45,234
Tell him I'll see him in the morning.

638
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,362
Can we return this? Her mother might like it.

639
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:49,530
Sure.

640
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,544
That's right.

641
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:22,234
Here.

642
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,263
This is Walter. Leave a message, wait for the beep.

643
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,934
Will, you there? Where else can you go in that state?

644
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:57,269
You must've been freezing.

645
01:04:57,478 --> 01:05:02,107
If you want, take a shower. There are clean towels in the bathroom.

646
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:11,659
This is Walter. Leave a message, wait for the beep.

647
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:16,163
Will, pick up. I'm not dumb enough to come back...

648
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,083
- Walter Finch. - Will.

649
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,377
Will Dormer, what are you doing?

650
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:25,214
I try to help and you're running around like a maniac.

651
01:05:25,381 --> 01:05:28,842
Were you gonna kill me? How would you explain that?

652
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:34,348
No one gets too upset when child murderers are brought in feet first.

653
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:38,852
There's no evidence I killed Kay. You know because I told you.

654
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:43,148
- Come on. What's wrong with you? - Guess I'm a little cranky.

655
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,985
- Lack of sleep. - Get some rest, will you?

656
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:49,196
Got some pills, and my bed's nice and comfy.

657
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:54,243
Another night up and you'll lose it. Hallucinating, babbling.

658
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:58,000
Tomorrow when you feel better, we'll meet in public.

659
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,623
We'll sort it out.

660
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,919
There's a ferry north of Nightmute. I'll be on the 11:00.

661
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:09,049
And before you leave, could you feed the dogs? They're on a diet.

662
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:47,630
Dormer? Fax from the lab.

663
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:50,257
Weapon was a.38 Smith & Wesson.

664
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:56,180
- We found something that might... - I found this. At the Connells'.

665
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,853
And?

666
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,440
It's the author of the book we found in Kay's bag.

667
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:09,318
It's signed by the author. He's a local.

668
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:12,655
Kay had all his books. We should check it out.

669
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:17,660
- Small stuff, right? - Yeah. Sure, sure.

670
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,413
Nice work, Ellie. She's got sharp eyes, huh?

671
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:24,667
You bet your ass she does.

672
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:27,044
Good stuff.

673
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,839
What a view.

674
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:16,886
- I'm not who you think I am. - No?

675
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:19,221
Walter Finch:

676
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:23,225
Lousy writer. Lonely freak.

677
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,895
Murderer. No?

678
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:30,482
When I was 7, my grandmother took me to Portland.

679
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:34,653
We were walking along and two guys snatched her purse.

680
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:37,698
A police officer came to ask questions.

681
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:41,201
He stood the whole time. Uniform looked brand-new.

682
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:46,457
Shoes, badge were polished. It was like a soldier, only better.

683
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:49,335
I respect your profession. I write about it.

684
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:54,173
I wanted to become a cop after school. I couldn't pass all the tests.

685
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:58,219
You should've tried Internal Affairs. They'd have taken you.

686
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:00,387
What do you want from me?

687
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:04,558
After Kay died, I knew everyone would think I meant to do it.

688
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:09,146
So I cleaned the body, removed all evidence connecting it to me.

689
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:12,107
Except for your fucking novel.

690
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:16,070
You don't always see the wood for the trees.

691
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:19,698
You, for one, should have figured that out by now.

692
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:33,337
When I heard they had brought somebody from L.A., I panicked.

693
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:37,174
I knew the locals would connect me to Kay eventually.

694
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:42,012
I could handle them. They never look in the eyes of a killer.

695
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:45,599
Killing changes you. You know that.

696
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,601
It's not guilt.

697
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,396
I never meant to do it.

698
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,899
It's like awareness.

699
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:57,861
Life is so important. How could it be so fucking fragile?

700
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,573
You'd see it right away, wouldn't you?

701
01:10:00,781 --> 01:10:04,827
You trying to impress me? Because you got the wrong guy.

702
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:07,871
Killing that girl made you feel special.

703
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:10,708
But you're not.

704
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:17,381
You're the same pathetic freak I've been dealing with for 30 years.

705
01:10:17,548 --> 01:10:20,801
Know how many of you I caught with your pants down?

706
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:24,054
I never touched her like that. 

707
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:27,141
You wanted to. Now you wish you had.

708
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:30,978
Best you could do is clip her nails.

709
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:36,317
Now you're so different. You don't get it, do you?

710
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,320
You're my job. You're what I'm paid to do.

711
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:44,033
You're about as mysterious to me as a toilet is to a plumber.

712
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:49,330
Reasons for doing what you did? Who gives a fuck?

713
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:52,041
Motivations are everything, Will.

714
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,836
What did you see through the fog?

715
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,507
I saw pretty clearly, didn't I? I saw you take aim...

716
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:03,802
- Forget it. ...shoot your partner in the chest.

717
01:11:05,221 --> 01:11:08,557
I heard him say, "Get away from me!" Why?

718
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:12,228
Anything to do with Internal Affairs investigation?

719
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:15,147
All that tension in your department?

720
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,443
- You think I'm that easy? - I'm saying that's how it looks.

721
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,488
Maybe even how it feels.

722
01:11:24,073 --> 01:11:30,496
How did it feel when you found out it was Hap? Guilt? Relief?

723
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,999
Suddenly, you're free and clear. 

724
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:36,585
Did you think about it before that moment?

725
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:40,673
What would it be like if he wasn't there anymore?

726
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:46,178
Doesn't mean you did it on purpose.

727
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:58,857
You figure if you got something on me, then I'll just roll over?

728
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:02,236
- Protect my reputation? - No.

729
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:04,405
Protect your life's work.

730
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:10,452
The scumbags you put away will be back on the street before you go on trial.

731
01:12:11,078 --> 01:12:13,559
With Hap gone, you're free and clear.

732
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,040
Why mess with that?

733
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:21,255
Kay Connell. Remember her?

734
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,550
It's your choice.

735
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:28,596
Think of all the other Kay Connells.

736
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:31,035
Do the math. You're a pragmatist.

737
01:12:31,035 --> 01:12:33,309
You have to be because of your job.

738
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:37,271
This isn't easy, but I want you to understand...

739
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:40,065
...we're in the same situation here.

740
01:12:40,608 --> 01:12:44,987
You didn't mean to kill Hap any more than I meant to kill Kay.

741
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:50,284
But that's hard for them to believe, so that's why we need each other.

742
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:55,497
We gotta find a patsy for the Connell case and make it stick.

743
01:12:56,206 --> 01:13:00,961
Then you go back to Los Angeles and I can go back to living my life.

744
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:07,635
So, what do you need from me?

745
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,639
What do they know about me?

746
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:18,896
They found a signed copy of one of your books at Kay's house.

747
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:23,484
- So you'll be brought in for questioning. - At the station?

748
01:13:23,651 --> 01:13:26,153
That's what they usually do.

749
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,074
Brought in for questioning. I can write that easily.

750
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:35,496
Calm down. It's no big thing. It's preliminary inquiry, so...

751
01:13:35,663 --> 01:13:37,998
...just tell the truth.

752
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:43,003
- Tell them about Randy... - Why are you talking about Randy?

753
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,756
Talk about your relationship with Kay.

754
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:48,342
You can't hide it, so just say it.

755
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:52,763
Randy is none of your business. It's not your affair.

756
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,683
Shouldn't I tell them she was unhappy...

757
01:13:55,849 --> 01:14:00,312
Tell them she was unhappy, but let them find Randy themselves.

758
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,357
That way, they'll make it stick.

759
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:05,359
Understand?

760
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,487
We need a wild card.

761
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:14,410
- A wild card? - Yeah. Something that's there.

762
01:14:14,577 --> 01:14:18,539
Something we can use. It's in every good detective novel.

763
01:14:18,706 --> 01:14:20,916
You still have the.38?

764
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:23,669
No.

765
01:14:24,712 --> 01:14:27,548
Really? That's a shame.

766
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:32,177
We could use that. That'd be very convincing for them.

767
01:14:34,972 --> 01:14:36,390
This is my stop.

768
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,234
Dormer!

769
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:55,200
Wild card!

770
01:15:03,584 --> 01:15:05,628
Working some overtime?

771
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:08,964
- Nice. - Cracking some big cases?

772
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:11,759
- Night. - Night, guys.

773
01:15:58,138 --> 01:16:01,100
This is always the worst time of night for me.

774
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:04,687
Too late for yesterday, too early for tomorrow.

775
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:08,857
Sorry about the tape. I had to make sure you'd follow through.

776
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:10,359
I'll follow through.

777
01:16:10,526 --> 01:16:14,405
I've been thinking it over. I should tell them about Randy.

778
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:19,660
- I think that's a bad idea. - But he's the patsy. He deserves it.

779
01:16:19,827 --> 01:16:22,871
You should have heard the shit Kay told me.

780
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:25,916
But these are cops. They're not children.

781
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:29,086
You don't throw things like that in their lap.

782
01:16:29,253 --> 01:16:31,297
I'll push them toward Randy.

783
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:33,465
When the time is right.

784
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:38,012
We don't have the gun. How will we convince them he's guilty?

785
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:40,306
Did you keep the dress?

786
01:16:40,848 --> 01:16:41,849
The dress?

787
01:16:42,016 --> 01:16:45,644
Kay's dress, nail clippings. What did you do with those?

788
01:16:45,853 --> 01:16:50,399
That's great. The dress. We could use that. Even better than the gun.

789
01:16:50,566 --> 01:16:54,153
- Where could he have taken her? - Where'd you take her?

790
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:57,448
- She died in the cabin, right? - Yeah.

791
01:16:57,656 --> 01:17:00,326
Where'd you take her to clean her up?

792
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:04,371
Don't think about that. This is tough enough for you.

793
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:06,415
- It was an accident. - Yeah.

794
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:11,629
- I didn't mean to kill her, you know. - I know, but what happened?

795
01:17:12,838 --> 01:17:17,218
She called and said that she and Randy had had a fight.

796
01:17:18,177 --> 01:17:22,681
She wanted to come over and talk, and I said, "Meet me at our place."

797
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:24,934
That's the cabin at the beach.

798
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,063
She comes over. She's distraught and a little drunk.

799
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:34,902
She starts telling me about how Randy and Tanya were carrying on.

800
01:17:36,445 --> 01:17:40,241
I only wanted to comfort her. Hold her.

801
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:47,748
I kissed her, and got a little excited...

802
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:52,086
... and she started laughing at me.

803
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:55,756
She wouldn't stop laughing.

804
01:17:56,298 --> 01:18:00,970
Ever had someone laugh at you when you're like that? Vulnerable.

805
01:18:01,136 --> 01:18:04,974
Laughing their ass off? Someone you thought respected you?

806
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:07,768
You ever have that happen?

807
01:18:08,477 --> 01:18:12,773
I just wanted to stop her laughing. And then, you know...

808
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:14,608
... I hit her.

809
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:19,321
Couple of times, to stop her. Get a little respect.

810
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:23,075
Randy did it all the time. She liked it when he did it.

811
01:18:23,284 --> 01:18:26,412
She never blamed him. Never wanted to leave him.

812
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,957
I do it, she starts screaming. She wouldn't stop.

813
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:34,461
She's screaming. I put my hand over her mouth.

814
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:38,966
Then I'm really scared. I'm scared shitless.

815
01:18:39,133 --> 01:18:43,721
More scared than I've ever been. I'm more scared than her.

816
01:18:43,888 --> 01:18:45,472
And then...

817
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,018
... everything was clear.

818
01:18:50,144 --> 01:18:52,062
There was no turning back.

819
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,693
And after that, I was calm.

820
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:00,696
Real calm.

821
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:06,660
You and I share a secret.

822
01:19:07,453 --> 01:19:10,623
We know how easy it is to kill somebody.

823
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:16,962
That ultimate taboo. It doesn't exist outside our minds.

824
01:19:17,296 --> 01:19:19,256
I didn't murder her.

825
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:23,886
I killed her, but it just ended up that way.

826
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:27,264
So where'd you take the body?

827
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:29,600
Thanks for listening to me.

828
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:34,438
Feels good to talk about that stuff. I'll be able to sleep now.

829
01:19:35,105 --> 01:19:37,191
You wanna talk about Hap?

830
01:19:49,036 --> 01:19:51,580
- Morning. - Your phone isn't working.

831
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:54,500
I turned it off. I needed to sleep. Sorry.

832
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:58,546
Fred called that author. He was happy to cooperate.

833
01:19:58,712 --> 01:20:02,424
He'll be in first thing, so we need to get to the office.

834
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:06,554
I forgot to tell you they sell these in stores in Anchorage.

835
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,932
- No way of finding out who bought it. - Okay.

836
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:13,602
Bet you're looking forward to getting back to L.A.

837
01:20:13,769 --> 01:20:16,355
Back to robbery homicide, or...

838
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,649
...maybe not.

839
01:20:18,816 --> 01:20:23,070
- What are you saying to me, Ellie? - Nothing.

840
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:29,410
Are you doing okay? You haven't been sleeping much.

841
01:20:29,577 --> 01:20:32,037
No, I haven't. No.

842
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:40,713
A good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle's missing.

843
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:44,133
A bad cop, because his conscience won't let him.

844
01:20:45,092 --> 01:20:47,845
- You said that once. - I did?

845
01:20:51,432 --> 01:20:54,518
Sounds like something I'd say, don't it?

846
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:58,981
I'll see you back there.

847
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:06,780
In what regard were you and her familiar?

848
01:21:08,782 --> 01:21:12,578
- How did you know her? - She was an avid reader of my novels.

849
01:21:12,745 --> 01:21:14,747
When did you meet her first?

850
01:21:14,914 --> 01:21:18,250
A year ago. She came to a signing in Nightmute.

851
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:22,296
She hung around afterwards. We chatted about my writing...

852
01:21:22,463 --> 01:21:24,798
...and how she wanted to write...

853
01:21:25,424 --> 01:21:28,260
...then she asked if she could visit me

854
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,096
and talk about books, things like that.

855
01:21:31,263 --> 01:21:34,099
- And she did? - Yeah, we became very close.

856
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:37,561
She got comfortable enough to show me her writing.

857
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:40,272
- What does she write? - Poetry, actually.

858
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:42,858
- Any good? - No, not really.

859
01:21:43,275 --> 01:21:46,946
- You tell her that? - Why would I?

860
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:53,452
Exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl, Finch?

861
01:21:53,661 --> 01:21:55,975
I was someone she could talk to.

862
01:21:55,975 --> 01:21:58,290
Someone outside of her everyday life.

863
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:01,752
That's why she needed me and approached me.

864
01:22:01,919 --> 01:22:04,129
Why'd she need you for that?

865
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:09,093
- Well, her boyfriend, Randy... - Randy Stetz?

866
01:22:09,969 --> 01:22:14,473
- Abusive little prick. He hit her. - We know all this already.

867
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,892
- It was getting worse. - So?

868
01:22:17,059 --> 01:22:18,602
A lot worse. Really.

869
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:22,147
Why all this eagerness to talk about Randy?

870
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:26,193
You're right. I'm sorry. That's probably all hearsay.

871
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,530
I don't want anything I say taken the wrong way.

872
01:22:29,697 --> 01:22:33,409
Anything you say to us at this stage is in confidence.

873
01:22:33,576 --> 01:22:38,205
Secondly, we're not a bunch of hotheads who'll draw crazy conclusions.

874
01:22:38,372 --> 01:22:41,000
- Okay. - Please, continue.

875
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:43,211
One more thing.

876
01:22:43,211 --> 01:22:46,839
Probably doesn't mean much, but I think Kay was scared.

877
01:22:47,047 --> 01:22:50,426
- I have myself to blame for that. - Why is that?

878
01:22:51,135 --> 01:22:55,055
Randy knew who I was. He knew that she had a friend...

879
01:22:55,222 --> 01:22:58,142
...someone she confided in. It made him furious.

880
01:22:58,517 --> 01:23:03,063
She wrote about being scared. Her letters were getting desperate.

881
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:06,233
You still have these letters, by any chance?

882
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,904
I probably do. Do you think it might help?

883
01:23:10,237 --> 01:23:11,739
They might.

884
01:23:13,908 --> 01:23:17,244
Okay. Anything else?

885
01:23:17,411 --> 01:23:21,749
The thing that worried her the most was the gun.

886
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:25,252
He had this old handgun. He showed it to her.

887
01:23:25,419 --> 01:23:29,173
I don't know where he got it, probably wasn't even his...

888
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:33,594
...but he said he'd use it if he found out who she was seeing.

889
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:38,682
He kept it hidden in a heating vent. You know, in the skirting boards?

890
01:23:42,603 --> 01:23:44,730
It might be the.38.

891
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:47,149
- Get me Judge Biggs. - What?

892
01:23:47,316 --> 01:23:50,110
I'm getting a search warrant to Randy's.

893
01:23:50,277 --> 01:23:54,615
- Get Judge Biggs on the phone. - I should get over there.

894
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:56,158
- No! - No?

895
01:23:56,325 --> 01:23:59,223
You're the guy he's talking to.

896
01:23:59,223 --> 01:24:02,122
So we're waiting for the warrant. Okay?

897
01:24:05,334 --> 01:24:08,629
Do you know when Randy showed her the gun?

898
01:24:08,837 --> 01:24:10,839
February?

899
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:14,093
No, probably January.

900
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:17,012
Why didn't you come forward when she died?

901
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:22,351
- She didn't want anybody to know. - Even when she was dead?

902
01:24:22,643 --> 01:24:26,897
Beaten to death. Her body dumped on a pile of garbage!

903
01:24:27,064 --> 01:24:28,816
- I was her friend. - No!

904
01:24:28,983 --> 01:24:31,860
- Acquaintance. We were close... - Close?

905
01:24:32,027 --> 01:24:35,656
She was attractive. Did you have sex with her?

906
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:38,742
- She was 17. - Seventeen? She was attractive.

907
01:24:38,909 --> 01:24:40,035
I suppose.

908
01:24:40,202 --> 01:24:43,497
Suppose? She was. So did you have sex with her?

909
01:24:43,664 --> 01:24:47,668
- No, I was her mentor. - You bought her things. Gifts.

910
01:24:48,043 --> 01:24:50,045
- Yes. - What kind of gifts?

911
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:55,050
- Books, mostly, that's what she loved. - Books? What about this?

912
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:58,470
- You give her this? - Yes.

913
01:24:59,096 --> 01:25:00,598
Why?

914
01:25:00,848 --> 01:25:03,767
- To see how she looked with it on? - No.

915
01:25:03,934 --> 01:25:06,770
- No? Why jewelry? - It was just a present.

916
01:25:06,937 --> 01:25:10,858
- Bought a lot of presents? Dresses? - What's wrong with that?

917
01:25:11,025 --> 01:25:14,862
Nothing. I'm figuring out what kind of mentor you were.

918
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:17,448
I gave her things she couldn't have.

919
01:25:17,615 --> 01:25:21,410
You wanted to fuck her, didn't you? Sick son of a bitch!

920
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:25,372
- Cool off. - Sick bastard.

921
01:25:25,956 --> 01:25:28,834
You have to cool down. Okay? Cool down.

922
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:32,630
All right. I need a break.

923
01:25:49,563 --> 01:25:52,733
I have to apologize on behalf of my colleague.

924
01:25:53,234 --> 01:25:57,321
He's been under a lot of pressure lately. But he's a good cop.

925
01:25:57,905 --> 01:26:01,033
I'd hate to see the bad cop.

926
01:26:06,247 --> 01:26:08,832
Search and seizure warrant. Yes, sir.

927
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:10,042
Randy Stetz.

928
01:26:23,764 --> 01:26:26,934
- We got our warrant! - Thank you. We appreciate it.

929
01:26:39,488 --> 01:26:42,074
Francis, come with me. Let's go!

930
01:26:47,288 --> 01:26:49,206
- You're not going? - No.

931
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,774
Are you not on the Connell case?

932
01:27:15,983 --> 01:27:19,820
I'm covering the shooting of Detective Dormer's partner.

933
01:27:19,987 --> 01:27:21,363
Heard about that.

934
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:26,514
Should I call about Kay's letters?

935
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:28,829
Yeah. I'll pick them up.

936
01:27:52,394 --> 01:27:55,147
Stetz! We're coming in!

937
01:28:12,164 --> 01:28:14,250
Turn the place over.

938
01:28:24,718 --> 01:28:26,637
Look there! Try over there!

939
01:28:27,096 --> 01:28:29,265
Rich, look here now.

940
01:28:36,146 --> 01:28:37,940
I got it! Hey, Fred!

941
01:28:58,252 --> 01:29:01,714
- Just in time, Dormer. - Had it in the motor oil.

942
01:29:04,717 --> 01:29:06,093
What the fuck is this?

943
01:29:29,491 --> 01:29:32,578
He says he was with Tanya when Kay was killed.

944
01:29:32,745 --> 01:29:35,039
- That's what she told me. - When?

945
01:29:35,205 --> 01:29:38,792
- When I questioned her. - Were you planning on telling us?

946
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:40,794
That's what I'm doing now.

947
01:29:46,717 --> 01:29:51,055
Randy and Tanya were screwing around. She's trying to protect him.

948
01:29:51,222 --> 01:29:53,474
- And the gun? - Says it isn't his.

949
01:29:53,641 --> 01:29:57,228
If we get the ballistics match, he'll be forthcoming.

950
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:59,480
- Leaving? - First thing tomorrow.

951
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:02,983
If Spencer can remember where he parked the plane.

952
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:32,930
I thought you wanted to kill me in the interview room.

953
01:30:33,097 --> 01:30:37,017
- Randy is in jail. - Said I'd write an ending they'd like.

954
01:30:37,226 --> 01:30:39,270
You were wrapped up in details.

955
01:30:39,436 --> 01:30:42,398
- The details? He's innocent. - No, he isn't.

956
01:30:42,565 --> 01:30:45,526
He beat Kay. One day he'd do something worse.

957
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:55,536
You knew I planted the gun?

958
01:30:55,703 --> 01:30:58,789
You wanted to help me before the tape recorder.

959
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:01,208
You had to have a wild card.

960
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:05,379
You're a good man. I know that, even if you've forgotten it.

961
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,549
When were you gonna point them at me?

962
01:31:08,549 --> 01:31:11,218
When you found Kay's dress?

963
01:31:11,802 --> 01:31:13,679
Where I took the body? 

964
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,556
If you have a gun and forensics...

965
01:31:15,723 --> 01:31:20,185
...wouldn't matter what I said about you killing your partner.

966
01:31:33,407 --> 01:31:35,618
May I have the tape?

967
01:31:43,334 --> 01:31:46,754
- Did you make any other copies? - Why would I?

968
01:31:47,046 --> 01:31:49,215
Stop me from turning you in.

969
01:31:49,882 --> 01:31:51,050
Or killing you.

970
01:31:51,258 --> 01:31:54,428
I don't have a hold over you. You made choices.

971
01:31:54,595 --> 01:31:56,826
Like I wasn't here. Why kill me?

972
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,057
It won't help Randy.

973
01:31:58,265 --> 01:32:00,517
After your scene at the department,

974
01:32:00,517 --> 01:32:02,770
it won't do you good if I'm dead.

975
01:32:02,937 --> 01:32:07,566
- A lot of ways a man can die. - Like an accident? Like Hap.

976
01:32:08,776 --> 01:32:10,110
Like Kay.

977
01:32:12,154 --> 01:32:16,033
It took you 10 minutes to beat Kay Connell to death.

978
01:32:16,325 --> 01:32:20,496
Ten fucking minutes. You calling that an accident?

979
01:32:20,663 --> 01:32:24,458
It took you a fraction of a second to kill your partner.

980
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:26,919
Is that more of an accident?

981
01:32:29,088 --> 01:32:31,090
Is this an accident?

982
01:32:34,969 --> 01:32:37,263
If you want it to be.

983
01:32:51,527 --> 01:32:53,737
It's over, Walt.

984
01:32:54,321 --> 01:32:56,865
It's over. I'm telling them everything.

985
01:32:56,865 --> 01:32:59,410
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.

986
01:32:59,577 --> 01:33:02,621
- What good would that do? - It'll end this thing.

987
01:33:02,997 --> 01:33:06,375
It won't end it. You're not thinking straight.

988
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:11,130
Will you tell the truth? You shot your partner and lied about it.

989
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:16,010
To them, you're a liar and a killer. You're tainted. Forever!

990
01:33:16,176 --> 01:33:19,929
You don't get to pick when you tell the truth.

991
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:21,682
The truth is beyond that.

992
01:33:22,766 --> 01:33:27,938
That tape was the only proof we had a conversation outside of that room.

993
01:33:29,106 --> 01:33:31,734
To them, I'm a writer that Kay admired.

994
01:33:31,901 --> 01:33:33,458
Randy is the killer,

995
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:35,015
and you're a hero cop.

996
01:33:35,015 --> 01:33:36,572
Your life's work is intact.

997
01:33:37,031 --> 01:33:41,702
Another abusive scumbag is in jail. Everything is as it should be.

998
01:33:41,869 --> 01:33:46,624
Go back to Los Angeles. The case against Randy is pretty solid.

999
01:33:46,999 --> 01:33:52,504
I can take care of everything here. I got it worked out. Go home.

1000
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:01,680
Midnight of your sixth night. You broke my record, Will.

1001
01:34:40,427 --> 01:34:44,348
- Randy Stetz. He was an asshole. - You knew him as a kid?

1002
01:34:44,515 --> 01:34:48,018
- Dads were on the same boat. - Bad seed.

1003
01:34:48,394 --> 01:34:50,479
How do you like our beer?

1004
01:34:56,193 --> 01:34:58,862
What Dormer needs is a little shuteye.

1005
01:34:59,029 --> 01:35:02,074
- White nights getting to you? - Hasn't been easy.

1006
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:04,618
- Better than winter. - Got that right.

1007
01:35:04,785 --> 01:35:07,350
Sun barely comes up for five months.

1008
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:09,915
Like being sucked into a black hole.

1009
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:13,794
Hey, Nancy Drew. You hear? We got him.

1010
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,880
Rich found the gun.

1011
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:21,135
- Something's on her mind. - I found this on the beach.

1012
01:35:21,302 --> 01:35:24,513
- What is it? - Shell casing, 9mm.

1013
01:35:25,556 --> 01:35:29,226
The murder weapon was a.38. None of us carries a 9mm.

1014
01:35:29,393 --> 01:35:31,395
Or backup weapon, right?

1015
01:35:33,063 --> 01:35:35,274
Get a hobby, would you?

1016
01:35:35,649 --> 01:35:38,903
It's a legitimate point, isn't it, detective?

1017
01:35:42,448 --> 01:35:44,575
This case is closed, Ellie.

1018
01:35:44,575 --> 01:35:46,702
Hold the fort, boys.

1019
01:35:46,702 --> 01:35:48,829
I'll go find a men's room.

1020
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:53,292
Relieve myself of your fine Alaskan beer.

1021
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:55,669
Do you want a beer or something?

1022
01:35:56,337 --> 01:35:57,963
No, thanks.

1023
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:02,718
- He's good people, right? - Don't get carried away.

1024
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,472
What has two thumbs and loves blowjobs?

1025
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,016
- I don't know. - This guy.

1026
01:36:18,943 --> 01:36:21,111
It's been something, Dormer.

1027
01:36:22,029 --> 01:36:25,032
It's been really great working with you.

1028
01:36:29,161 --> 01:36:32,790
- Run Will to the airport? - I gotta pick up the letters.

1029
01:36:32,957 --> 01:36:34,083
In Umkumiut...

1030
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:38,796
At his lake house. Dormer will have to leave my car at the dock.

1031
01:36:38,963 --> 01:36:42,591
- lf that's okay with you? - Yeah, it's fine.

1032
01:36:48,973 --> 01:36:50,975
It's been a pleasure.

1033
01:36:51,141 --> 01:36:52,768
Get some sleep.

1034
01:38:16,227 --> 01:38:17,811
Detective Dormer.

1035
01:38:19,146 --> 01:38:20,105
What is it?

1036
01:38:20,314 --> 01:38:24,318
Someone's complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep.

1037
01:38:25,069 --> 01:38:26,946
Something wrong?

1038
01:38:28,864 --> 01:38:31,700
It's so fucking bright in here.

1039
01:38:34,161 --> 01:38:36,288
No, it's dark in here.

1040
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:42,795
Will you please...?

1041
01:38:57,268 --> 01:39:02,898
There's this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24. Works part time at a copy store.

1042
01:39:03,524 --> 01:39:06,902
Every day he watches this 8-year-old boy...

1043
01:39:07,069 --> 01:39:10,489
...waiting for his carpool across the street.

1044
01:39:10,656 --> 01:39:15,035
- This is one of your cases? - Yeah. Hap and me.

1045
01:39:15,202 --> 01:39:16,704
A year and a half ago.

1046
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:19,507
For six months, he watches this kid.

1047
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:22,209
Finally gets up the nerve.

1048
01:39:22,376 --> 01:39:26,005
He goes down, grabs that boy before the carpool comes...

1049
01:39:26,171 --> 01:39:29,258
...takes him back to his apartment...

1050
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:33,304
...and keeps him there for three days.

1051
01:39:34,388 --> 01:39:36,682
He tortures him...

1052
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,104
...and makes him do things.

1053
01:39:42,271 --> 01:39:45,524
And, finally, he's had enough. He gets a rope.

1054
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:50,404
He hangs the boy in a storage space in the basement of the building.

1055
01:39:50,696 --> 01:39:52,948
But he didn't do it right.

1056
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:58,871
Little boy's neck didn't break, so he dangled there for a while...

1057
01:39:59,079 --> 01:40:02,041
...and then died finally from the shock.

1058
01:40:02,249 --> 01:40:06,086
Landlord found the body five days later.

1059
01:40:06,587 --> 01:40:10,216
The second I met this guy, Dobbs, I knew he was guilty.

1060
01:40:10,424 --> 01:40:13,969
That's what I do. That's my job. I assign guilt.

1061
01:40:14,136 --> 01:40:16,096
You find the evidence...

1062
01:40:16,597 --> 01:40:21,518
...figure out who did it, and then you go get them and put them away.

1063
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:26,252
This time there wasn't enough evidence.

1064
01:40:26,252 --> 01:40:29,485
And it's reasonable doubt to a jury...

1065
01:40:29,652 --> 01:40:34,114
...because a jury never met a child murderer before.

1066
01:40:34,281 --> 01:40:35,449
But I have.

1067
01:40:37,785 --> 01:40:38,953
Anyway...

1068
01:40:42,665 --> 01:40:47,294
I went and took some blood samples from the boy's dead body...

1069
01:40:49,797 --> 01:40:51,382
...and I planted them...

1070
01:40:54,718 --> 01:40:56,762
...in Dobbs' apartment.

1071
01:41:02,476 --> 01:41:04,061
I could feel it there.

1072
01:41:05,187 --> 01:41:07,731
This is gonna catch up with me.

1073
01:41:08,357 --> 01:41:10,609
I don't do things like that.

1074
01:41:10,609 --> 01:41:12,861
So how did it catch up with you?

1075
01:41:13,028 --> 01:41:16,490
Internal Affairs is coming down on our department.

1076
01:41:16,657 --> 01:41:21,161
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...

1077
01:41:21,996 --> 01:41:24,748
...and bring me straight into it.

1078
01:41:24,999 --> 01:41:28,586
They would've reopened Dobbs' case, he would've walked.

1079
01:41:28,752 --> 01:41:32,089
Now that won't happen. And I don't know...

1080
01:41:32,965 --> 01:41:35,175
...how I feel about that.

1081
01:41:36,927 --> 01:41:40,639
But Dobbs was guilty. Dobbs needed to be convicted.

1082
01:41:40,848 --> 01:41:45,185
So the end justifies the means.

1083
01:41:46,896 --> 01:41:48,188
Right?

1084
01:41:51,692 --> 01:41:55,321
- I'm in no position to judge. - Why not?

1085
01:41:55,738 --> 01:41:58,407
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.

1086
01:41:58,574 --> 01:42:00,000
The ones who are born here,

1087
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,871
and the ones who come here to escape something.

1088
01:42:04,705 --> 01:42:06,373
I wasn't born here.

1089
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:10,002
Why don't you tell me what you think?

1090
01:42:10,377 --> 01:42:14,673
Here. Now. In this room. You and me.

1091
01:42:15,591 --> 01:42:16,800
Please.

1092
01:42:20,888 --> 01:42:24,642
I guess it's about what you thought was right at the time.

1093
01:42:26,602 --> 01:42:29,480
Then, what you're willing to live with.

1094
01:44:10,122 --> 01:44:13,083
- Nightmute Police Department. - Detective Burr.

1095
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:17,463
She's not here. She left town about 20 minutes ago to go pick up...

1096
01:44:42,363 --> 01:44:44,865
- Mr. Finch. - Detective Burr.

1097
01:44:45,032 --> 01:44:46,909
- Are they friendly? - Yeah.

1098
01:44:47,076 --> 01:44:49,682
Didn't expect to see you this soon.

1099
01:44:49,682 --> 01:44:52,289
Sorry about the mess, doing some work.

1100
01:45:05,427 --> 01:45:09,223
Could Kay's letters strengthen the case against Randy?

1101
01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:10,599
Possibly.

1102
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:45,050
Watch your head. I've done it 1000 times.

1103
01:45:52,141 --> 01:45:56,145
Sorry about all the clutter. I am a pack-rat.

1104
01:45:57,479 --> 01:45:59,481
I keep everything.

1105
01:46:00,357 --> 01:46:02,693
I got them. Just don't know where.

1106
01:46:04,612 --> 01:46:08,616
- They've gotta be here somewhere. - Working on a new book?

1107
01:46:08,782 --> 01:46:11,577
- Have you read any of my books? - I haven't.

1108
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:55,371
- She knows, Will. - Where is she?

1109
01:46:55,537 --> 01:46:57,400
She knows you killed Hap.

1110
01:46:57,410 --> 01:47:00,417
You would've realized if you weren't strung out.

1111
01:47:00,584 --> 01:47:03,337
- The way she looks at you... - Where is she?

1112
01:47:03,504 --> 01:47:06,924
- It's under control. - lf anything happened to her...

1113
01:47:07,091 --> 01:47:08,092
She's okay.

1114
01:47:08,259 --> 01:47:10,865
If she talks, you're fucked.

1115
01:47:10,865 --> 01:47:13,472
Everything you've worked for is destroyed.

1116
01:47:15,599 --> 01:47:18,686
- Now give me... - Show me where she is. Now.

1117
01:47:18,852 --> 01:47:23,107
She's okay. Listen. I mean, it's all fine.

1118
01:47:26,235 --> 01:47:28,862
Let's search this place. For the dress.

1119
01:47:29,029 --> 01:47:30,948
- What dress? - Ellie's...

1120
01:47:31,365 --> 01:47:33,200
- Kay's! - You're rambling.

1121
01:47:33,367 --> 01:47:34,451
Ellie's here.

1122
01:47:34,618 --> 01:47:36,620
- I'm taking care of us. - Us?

1123
01:47:37,037 --> 01:47:38,622
- She saw the dress. - Us?

1124
01:47:38,789 --> 01:47:41,417
Where'd you get us? Don't talk about us.

1125
01:47:41,584 --> 01:47:43,460
She's alive, Will. Ellie!

1126
01:48:14,283 --> 01:48:15,618
Hold it!

1127
01:48:17,745 --> 01:48:18,871
Don't move!

1128
01:48:19,538 --> 01:48:21,999
You shot Detective Eckhart.

1129
01:48:24,335 --> 01:48:26,587
And Finch saw you do it.

1130
01:48:30,382 --> 01:48:32,718
Did you mean to shoot Hap?

1131
01:48:33,844 --> 01:48:36,180
I don't know anymore.

1132
01:48:38,307 --> 01:48:39,767
I don't know.

1133
01:48:42,436 --> 01:48:47,858
I couldn't see him through the fog, but when I got up close...

1134
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:51,403
...he was afraid of me...

1135
01:48:51,946 --> 01:48:56,492
...and he thought I meant to do it, so maybe I did.

1136
01:48:59,995 --> 01:49:02,498
I just don't know anymore.

1137
01:49:18,681 --> 01:49:20,558
- Where's your gun? - He took it.

1138
01:49:25,521 --> 01:49:27,314
Keep your head down.

1139
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:32,611
I got seven rounds in this clip. Make it last. Head down.

1140
01:49:36,657 --> 01:49:39,034
Okay, go! Go!

1141
01:50:35,132 --> 01:50:37,051
You forgot the wild card.

1142
01:51:51,959 --> 01:51:54,086
Detective Dormer!

1143
01:51:57,006 --> 01:52:02,511
I called for backup. They'll be here soon. Dormer, just hold on.

1144
01:52:03,137 --> 01:52:05,055
Hold on.

1145
01:52:13,063 --> 01:52:15,774
Nobody needs to know.

1146
01:52:19,695 --> 01:52:23,324
You didn't mean to do it. I know that even if you don't.

1147
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:25,784
No, don't. Don't.

1148
01:52:25,951 --> 01:52:27,786
What?

1149
01:52:29,413 --> 01:52:30,623
Why?

1150
01:52:32,666 --> 01:52:35,252
Don't lose your way.

1151
01:52:40,925 --> 01:52:42,843
Hang on.

1152
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:46,388
Dormer.

1153
01:52:47,681 --> 01:52:49,433
Let me sleep.

1154
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,518
No.

1155
01:52:52,519 --> 01:52:55,481
Just let me sleep.
