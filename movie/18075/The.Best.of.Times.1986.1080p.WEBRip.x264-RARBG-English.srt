1
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,130
These are not the best of times,

2
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,031
and nothing comes easy anymore.

3
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,966
In fact,
ever since the fall of man,

4
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:07,401
things have been tough everywhere,

5
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,238
especially in the San Joaquin Valley.

6
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,140
But in 1910,

7
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,742
in the southwest corner of Kern County,

8
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,978
God spoke in a gusher of black gold.

9
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:19,613
We had a chance for greatness,

10
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,316
and in 1911, we changed our name.

11
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,987
That was also the first year

12
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:30,158
Taft Midway Union High School
played Bakersfield High

13
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,459
in football.

14
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,228
We lost 56 to 0.

15
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,432
We also lost 25,000 barrels of oil a day

16
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,001
because nobody could figure out how to cap the well.

17
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,003
But we got on the map.

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,872
You got to make trade-offs.

19
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,241
For instance, we've got the worst goddamn weather

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,178
in the world, but it builds character.

21
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,180
That's a trade-off.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,449
And in 1913, we had a chance to test that character.

23
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,319
Taft's own Kid Lester, the toughest bastard

24
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,787
to ever come out of the oil fields,

25
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,190
got to fight the great Sam Langford,

26
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,625
the number one heavyweight contender in the world.

27
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,630
Rumor had it that Langford was out of shape

28
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,732
and didn't take the fight seriously.

29
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,402
They said he didn't have a right hand anymore.

30
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,070
Kid Lester predicted a knockout in the fifth round,

31
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:20,408
and, unfortunately, he got it.

32
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,510
The kid slipped quietly out of town,

33
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,077
and was never seen again,

34
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,314
though he vowed he would someday return

35
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:27,781
to redeem himself.

36
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,320
Bakersfield beat us by four touchdowns that year.

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,222
And then, a plague was thrown upon the people of Taft

38
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,524
that even Job didn't have to deal with.

39
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,259
Mice.

40
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,028
100 million mice came up out of a dry lake,

41
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,863
and marched on Taft

42
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,866
Only when thousands of seagulls
flew over from Ventura County

43
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,668
were they beaten back.

44
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,271
Well, eaten back, actually.

45
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,106
It rained all the next winter.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,610
Bakersfield 82, Taft 6.

47
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,948
It seems like every year, they beat us 82 to 6,

48
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,685
but in 1972, something happened.

49
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,321
A great athlete rose up out of the Taft desert

50
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,291
to cast a shadow beyond the
boundaries of Kern County.

51
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,593
A Greek god, a leader of men,

52
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,262
a quarterback.

53
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,330
A great quarterback.

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,267
We had Reno Hightower.

55
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:23,103
At last, a chance to beat Bakersfield.

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,640
November 15, 1972, our moment in history.

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,709
Only seconds left in a scoreless game.

58
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,378
Reno goes back to pass; a golden arm.

59
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,313
He lets fly, and as he does,

60
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,148
he's hit by half the Bakersfield team.

61
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,851
His knee is smashed, his career is over.

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,323
Ah, but what a pass--
65 yards in the air, at least.

63
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,892
We still had a chance to beat Bakersfield.

64
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,126
And somebody's open,

65
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,128
some third-string wide receiver.

66
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:51,131
The ball's laid right in his hands,

67
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,802
but that son of a bitch dropped it!

68
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,372
I was that son of a bitch.

69
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,408
And as you can plainly see,

70
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,142
my mistake was so horrible,

71
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,445
not only has it haunted me ever since,

72
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,380
it has forced the entire town

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,583
to slip quietly into oblivion forever.

74
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,852
Sort of like Kid Lester.

75
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,727
I'm sorry, sir, but your wife is here.

76
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:23,331
Thank you, Marcy. Go file something.

77
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,233
I should've caught the damn thing.

78
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,402
Darling, what can I do for you?

79
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,338
Honey, I'm sorry to disturb you at work.

80
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,905
I know you're a busy man.

81
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,607
Could the bank make a donation of $100

82
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:34,908
to the Women's Club production of

83
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,344
Fiddler On the Roof at the Petroleum Club?

84
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,578
We're doing a modern version.

85
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,914
"If I were that rich dude." How about $200?

86
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,850
Jack, you're a doll.

87
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,985
Also, Jaki's class is having a party at school.

88
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,254
She was supposed to bring the potato chips.
Could you drop some off?

89
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,689
Honey, I am the vice-president of the bank.

90
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,091
- I'm a very...
- Ruffles. That would be nice.

91
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,126
You have it.

92
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,728
- Hon?
- Huh?

93
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,365
- Are you happy?
- I'm happy.

94
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,833
You say "I'm happy" to make me feel happy,

95
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,703
- but are you happy?
- I'm happy!

96
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,004
Me, too.

97
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,740
- Bring it in boys.
- Oh, my God. Daddy's here.

98
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,444
Mayday! Got to look busy.

99
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,445
Does this look busy?

100
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,781
Looks busy to me.

101
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,883
Surprise!

102
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,386
- Hello.
- Bring it in, boys.

103
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,820
Right there on the wall, behind the desk.

104
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,955
What's that?

105
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,558
Me. I had ten of 'em painted up,

106
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,394
one for each of my banks.

107
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,829
All in the tradition of Velazquez.

108
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,964
What do you think?

109
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,800
I like Velazquez.

110
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,403
He's damn good for a Mexican, huh?

111
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,405
What are you doing, trying to look busy?

112
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,607
I look busy, sir, I am busy.

113
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,877
Don't get hurt.

114
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,312
Thank you very much for calling.

115
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,882
So, Jack... what do you think?

116
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,484
Think it's a bit too much?

117
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,421
Tell me the truth.

118
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,823
Well, it's slightly ostentatious.

119
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,791
Damn right!

120
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,428
Grand statement on a grand theme!

121
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,430
Can't see no brush strokes either.

122
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,797
Paid extra for that.

123
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,033
Well, now, butterfingers--

124
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,136
Daddy, I'm sorry you can't stay longer.

125
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,304
Sorry I can't stay longer, honey.

126
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,541
- Got nine more of these to go.
- Is that all?

127
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,676
- Come on, boys.
- Nice to see you.

128
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,678
I hope everything's okay in Bakersfield.

129
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,649
Okay? Bakersfield High's got
one hell of a team this year!

130
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:25,919
Should beat Taft 84 to 0 again!

131
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,521
Bye!

132
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,694
"Okay?"

133
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,097
"Bakersfield High has a
great football team this year!"

134
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,533
"Should beat Taft--"

135
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,612
Goddamn it!

136
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,581
Why did Reno Hightower throw that ball to me?

137
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,550
Oh, Jack, you've only seen him once a week

138
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,986
for the last thirteen years.
You've had 1,000 chances.

139
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,254
Why don't you ask him? What's the problem?

140
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,356
What's the problem?

141
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,727
Problem is, El, it's that time of year again.

142
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,563
- When the first leaf--
- "of autumn falls forlornly

143
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,864
on the barren ground below."

144
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,066
Right. El?

145
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,868
I'm happy, okay?

146
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,369
Okay.

147
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,606
Anyway, thanks for the donation.

148
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,908
Don't forget the chips. Bye-bye.

149
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,521
Aw, Carlos, more sharks.

150
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,823
My client wants lots of sharks.

151
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,291
Lady Di's got to be in deep shit.

152
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,392
It's more emotional.

153
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,162
Lady Di? I thought that was Pia Zadora.

154
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,166
- Is this dry yet?
- Yeah, man. It's ready.

155
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,669
Okay, take it down.

156
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,938
Easy, now. Easy.

157
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,405
Careful.

158
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,709
Huh? What do you think?

159
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,878
- It's your best work, Reno.
- Thanks, man.

160
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,451
A little more shading on top of the bicep.

161
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:07,120
I wanna give God a little more definition.

162
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,189
Hey, Jack. What's your problem?

163
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,892
It sounds like crap. That's what the problem is.

164
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,329
See, it's clicking.

165
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,031
No, it's pinging.

166
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,033
Pinging. That's a lot of technical talk.

167
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,869
Jack, you need a valve job.

168
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,204
- Need more than a valve job.
- Reno, I gotta talk to you.

169
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,140
Not now, honey. I got a noisy
Continental and a wet Lady Di.

170
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,043
You always got a noisy
Continental and a wet Lady Di.

171
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,112
- Hi, Gigi.
- Hi, Jack.

172
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,782
- I want to talk alone.
- Come on.

173
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,757
Honey, I don't like being embarrassed like that

174
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,593
- in front of the guys.
- Sorry.

175
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,061
It's not good for business, okay?

176
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,864
- What do you want, sweetheart?
- I want a divorce.

177
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,067
Okay, I know your VDub needs a new muffler--

178
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,604
and tire rod bushings and an exhaust manifold.

179
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,438
That's not why I'm here.
I've been meaning to get to it,

180
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,741
so I'll get Eddie on it right now, okay? Eddie!

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,143
My life's out of tune, not my VDub.

182
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,046
- This is sudden.
- No, it's not.

183
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,781
Reno, let's face it.

184
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,449
Things haven't been the way they were between us.

185
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,019
They haven't been that way for a long, long time.

186
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,922
I made some notes so I wouldn't mess up.

187
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,957
"I've got to get out of Taft."

188
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,861
this is no place for a singer to get launched.

189
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,697
"My mind's made up." It has been for a long time.

190
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,267
I was waiting for the right time,
but there is no right time.

191
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,804
"I--" I was crying and the words smudged.

192
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,273
- I can't read this.
- I can read your writing.

193
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,877
"As soon as I get up the courage,
I'll talk to Teddy.

194
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,412
I'm sorry, I don't want
to be married to you anymore."

195
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,849
- Right?
- Right.

196
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,857
I...I got to go.

197
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,458
Oh, come on, honey.

198
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,795
I'm moving out.

199
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,130
Now, wait a minute, honey.

200
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,601
- Bye.
- Aw, come on, Gigi. Aw, shoot.

201
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,542
Ah, a family spat.

202
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,945
Dinner and a movie, she'll be fine.

203
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,348
Can I offer you some marital advice?

204
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,784
No.

205
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,186
There's only one way a man
can come back to his woman

206
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,454
after she's dumped him,
and still maintain his pride.

207
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,724
Only one way.

208
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,827
Crawl, with dignity, of course,

209
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,796
and women will forgive anything.

210
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,631
- Shut up, Jack.
- You got it.

211
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,300
Gigi's got as far as the county line

212
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,102
before she always comes back.

213
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,172
She can't get L.A. out of her head.

214
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,809
First time she's ever used the word divorce.

215
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,076
What?

216
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,012
Yeah.

217
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,716
That's a terrible word, Reno.
Divorce, terrible.

218
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,584
She's gonna leave me as soon as I fix her car.

219
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,287
- Are you gonna fix it?
- Hell, no! I love her!

220
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,524
I don't know what to say.

221
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,392
Neither do I.

222
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,562
You got a burned out intake
valve on number five, Jack.

223
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,264
It will cost you 400 bucks.

224
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,834
Four hundred dollars?

225
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:10,971
How the hell can I argue with you
when your wife just left you?

226
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,340
My great sorrow at your domestic problems

227
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,342
prevents me from calling you a crook.

228
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,111
Get out of here, Jack.

229
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,647
What about my car?

230
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,083
Goddamn it! You got a choice, Jack.

231
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,385
For 400 bucks, I'll fix it right,

232
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,088
or for $1.50, I'll throw a can of STP
into the crank case again,

233
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,758
it'll still run shitty,
but for a week, it'll sound great.

234
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,293
- What do you want?
- Here's $1.50.

235
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,195
In a week, I might be dead.

236
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,765
Can I have a loaner so I
can get back to the bank?

237
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,300
It'll take me fifteen minutes, Jack.

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,502
I've got a board meeting, Reno.

239
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,471
That's all I got.

240
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,039
Perfect.

241
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,392
Hey, Jack.

242
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,295
Some of us think the reason
you take a loaner out every week

243
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,898
is 'cause you're going to the
massage parlor at the city limits,

244
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,200
and you need a car you won't be recognized in.

245
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,138
I will not even dignify that with a reply.

246
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,878
I've never paid for it in my life.

247
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,818
Adios, muchacho.

248
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,568
Visa or MasterCard?

249
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,840
- Visa.
- Thanks.

250
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,175
Okay, now you can start. Meter's running.

251
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,415
There are times when a man must look deep

252
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,852
into the bowels of his soul,

253
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,856
right into the darkest chambers where demons lurk.

254
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,991
- What's wrong, hon?
- My wife's unhappy.

255
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,693
- How do you know?
- Men know.

256
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,295
Am I a good lover, Darla?

257
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,964
- The best.
- Thank you.

258
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,731
How do you know? We never do it.

259
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,969
Women know. Is that what we're
gonna talk about today?

260
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,872
No, no. I'm gonna go dark here today.

261
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,006
Right into the bowels of hell.

262
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,074
Which bowels of hell?

263
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,878
Taft versus Bakersfield, 1972.

264
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,580
Football. That's a bowel of hell, all right.

265
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,448
Goddamn it.

266
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,885
If I'd just caught that ball,

267
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,719
my whole life would be different.

268
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,889
This is Ace Jointers and Extruders.

269
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,391
Number 441-06-9542.

270
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,726
$60.

271
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,428
What the hell are you doing?

272
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,297
It's a new rule. We have to
call in anything over 50 bucks.

273
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,400
This is outrageous! I'm emotionally naked here!

274
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,502
Get a Gold Card. I don't have to call those in.

275
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,370
I've applied. Goddamn it, Darla.

276
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,907
I want to talk about my darkest sides!

277
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,743
Soon as I get approval. I hate calling
these things in as much as you do.

278
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,546
It hit me right in the hands, Darla!
Right in the hands.

279
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,749
Thank you. Sorry, Jack, it's no good.

280
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,284
You're right, it's no good.
I can't live like this.

281
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,452
Jack, the card!

282
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,287
What? I'll sue!

283
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,755
Calm down, Jack.

284
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,825
Calm down.

285
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,062
Maybe we can work something out for under $50.

286
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,164
Can I talk about the game for under $50?

287
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,366
- Aw, Jack!
- Please.

288
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,803
I know every county line in the San Joaquin Valley.

289
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:33,206
I came here a few months back for a little variety.

290
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,774
All I hear about is some tie game

291
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,144
played thirteen years ago I can barely remember.

292
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,180
Come on, Darla, you were gridiron princess.

293
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,084
Remember? The homecoming queen?

294
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,485
Come on.

295
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,420
You remember. Reno remembers.

296
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,322
The whole goddamn town remembers.

297
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,224
- Okay, I remember!
- And? And?

298
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,525
And you should have caught the damn ball.

299
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,361
Oh, I knew it! Oh!

300
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,496
Agh!

301
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,399
Grr!

302
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,035


303
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,113
Can't you make a comeback?

304
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,814
From what?

305
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,783
I'm not a has-been.

306
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,585
I'm a never-was.

307
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,552
I aspire to be a has-been.

308
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,089
Oh, that's it, Jack.

309
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,057
I'm not listening to this crapola,

310
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,592
and it is crapola, every week.

311
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,194
You got unfinished business, finish it.

312
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,629
- How?
- Play the game again.

313
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,631
You can't just play the game again!

314
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,433
- You can't play the game again.
- Why not?

315
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,834
Because you can't rewrite history.

316
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,004
- Why not?
- It's an unnatural act.

317
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,206
Jack, there is no such thing as an unnatural act.

318
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,673
I should know.

319
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,110
Tell me one good reason that you
can't play that game again?

320
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,212
- Just one.
- All right, I'll tell you!

321
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,080
You can't because...

322
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,681
because...

323
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,251
One reason, Jack. Just one.

324
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,368
Hey, Teddy.

325
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,469
Hey, Dad.

326
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,438
How was school today?

327
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,873
P.E. was okay, but in shop class,

328
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,043
the teacher started acting weird again.

329
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:19,412
Today, he told us that Taft, California
was the safest place in America

330
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,281
in case of a nuclear war.

331
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,050
He said it's 'cause of the winds.

332
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,253
- Sounds weird enough.
- Teddy, are you out there, honey?

333
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,122
So, I guess Mom told you she's moving.

334
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,058
Yeah, she might've said something.

335
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,759
But it's just to the motel. She'll be back.

336
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,628
Hell, I know. A woman needs
breathing room now and then.

337
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,497
Hell, I know.

338
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,567
- Teddy, can you give me a hand, honey?
- Yeah.

339
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,469
Oh, hurry!

340
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,206
Thanks, honey.

341
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,075
Whoa!

342
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,177
I'm so bogged down in Taft.

343
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,345
So's your father, but he doesn't know it.

344
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,681
Your father's lost his drive.

345
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,283
Oh! Careful!

346
00:16:56,383 --> 00:17:00,287
I'm going to give this singing a shot.

347
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:04,491
I just don't want to settle for second-best.

348
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:10,930
Second-best? Second-best?

349
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,433
I'll tell you why I don't want to leave Taft.

350
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,302
I'll tell you.

351
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,104
It's a fair question, okay?

352
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,673
I can't believe you. You say why...

353
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,343
why I don't want to leave Taft?

354
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,344
I'm comfortable here.

355
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,613
This place is a hellhole.

356
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,350
Oh, boy, if you knew anything,
you'd know Taft has been judged

357
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,119
the safest city in America

358
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,254
in case of an all-out nuclear war.

359
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,356
Yeah, it's because of the winds.

360
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,591
- Ha! The winds?
- That's right.

361
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,694
Oh, man, you're unbelievable!

362
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,232
You think the Russians
won't go for the oil fields?

363
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,700
You think they won't wipe out our energy?

364
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,702
Taft will be the first to go.

365
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,572
Oh, wow, so you think they won't hit L.A.?

366
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,607
Of course I think the Russians would hit L.A.,

367
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,344
but at least up until the world ended,

368
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,246
I'd be in the big leagues!

369
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,182
Okay, Gigi, I'll give you another
reason I don't wanna leave Taft.

370
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,252
I just happen to have a very
successful business here.

371
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,687
You just happen to owe six months' mortgage.

372
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,456
Five months!

373
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:13,693
- Besides, you can't leave me yet.
- Why not?

374
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,496
Your VDub doesn't work.

375
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,169
I'm taking it to another shop.

376
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,405
Oh, wow.

377
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,774
I have never been unfaithful to you.

378
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,376
Never.

379
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,545
Oh, you know...

380
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,982
I'm just tired of all the junk.

381
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:39,018
The junk in my life...

382
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,588
the junk in this yard.

383
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,394
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

384
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,863
Now, you just name one piece
of junk in this yard,

385
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,200
- and I'll get rid of it, okay?
- You don't even understand.

386
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,868
- No, I do. No, I do.
- No, you don't.

387
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,437
Just name one piece of junk--

388
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,840
junk-- and it's gone.

389
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,784
What's this?

390
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,221
That's...

391
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,423
a '53 Studebaker brake drum.

392
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,590
It's a classic.

393
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,227
Interchangeable with later model Volvos,

394
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,961
small Chevys, some imported pickups,

395
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:25,632
- '74s to '78s.
- Some '79s.

396
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,267
Right.

397
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,774
I'll be at the Top Hat Motel.

398
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,318


399
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,663
Reno, I got to talk to you.

400
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:01,234
Reno, I have just come up with a big idea.

401
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,236
It's a one-in-a-lifetime monster concept.

402
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,771
It's a killer. You want to hear it?

403
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,606
Can't wait.

404
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,975
We play the game again.

405
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,312
What game?

406
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,646
What do you mean, what game?

407
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,515
The game!

408
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,717
How many were there,
for Christ's sakes? The biggie.

409
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,587
Your greatest pass, my greatest drop.

410
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,622
Oh, that game.

411
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,757
You and me are gonna breathe new life

412
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,626
into the bowels of our souls.

413
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,195
We'll charge into the deepest
chambers where demons lurk,

414
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,331
kick the shit out of the little bastards,

415
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,400
and change the miserable past in the bargain.

416
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,402
I like the miserable past, Jack.

417
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,970
Okay! All right! All right! All right! Okay!

418
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,875
If not for me or not for you,

419
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,945
why don't we replay the game for the whole town?

420
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,316
We can raise Taft out of lethargy.

421
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,354
Okay, Jack, you listen to me for a change.

422
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,989
You dropped the ball. The whole town didn't.

423
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,427
You want to breathe new life
into bowels where chambers lurk,

424
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,529
you do it.

425
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,366
Colonel, sir.

426
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:11,738
I propose we replay the historic game of 1972.

427
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:16,743
"Jack, Jack, Jack. Life is short."

428
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,978
"I don't have time for this
little descent into this..."

429
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,013
personal madness of yours.

430
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,017
In layman's terms, Jack, you make me sick.

431
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,820
- May I take that as a yes, colonel?
- I'm a busy man.

432
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,456
I got the Tiger Booster Club,

433
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,657
I got the sports federation,

434
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,592
I got the Black and Orange Round Table.

435
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,894
As you probably heard, I'm now the chief

436
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,564
executive officer of the new Potato Bowl.

437
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,366
Do you think I'm here on my own, colonel?

438
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,767
Who could you possibly represent?

439
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:44,537
Taft. The entire goddamn town.

440
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,740
I am throwing down the gauntlet, sir!

441
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,443
Gauntlet, my ass! I don't believe this!

442
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,379
Is that fear I hear in your voice, colonel?

443
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,880
My poor Elly.

444
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,382
Ten years ago, I gave you a job

445
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,850
so she wouldn't be married to a bum.

446
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,486
The day I hear she's thrown you out

447
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,721
is the day you announce
your resignation from the bank

448
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,725
and slip quietly out of town forever,
sort of like Kid Lester.

449
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,994
Kid Lester got hit by a lucky punch, sir.

450
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,662
- No such thing as luck.
- Maybe.

451
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,230
Victories for the underdog

452
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,965
are an aberration of the order of the universe.

453
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,068
That's why I've had damn few losses in my time.

454
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,406
The biggest one was the day
you married my daughter.

455
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,841
- She could have had Johnny-O.
- Sir. Sir.

456
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,746
Even a clown like you has to admit
she'd have been better off

457
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,815
married to this great halfback.

458
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,883
I'm not willing to go that far, sir.

459
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,419
Look at these pictures.

460
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,155
Bakersfield High School
football is my life, my soul.

461
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,557
And your tax write-off.

462
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:41,861
Tax loopholes are a God-given right!

463
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,096
Probably even constitutional.

464
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,866
These young men are like sons to me.

465
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:50,336
Look at this. Great men, great poses.

466
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:53,272
Sir, there's more to life than this.

467
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,909
Oh, Jack, you can't even pose.

468
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,446
In your entire life,

469
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:02,915
you've done one significantly correct thing.

470
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,917
What was that, sir?

471
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,854
You dropped the ball.

472
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:11,524
You verified the order of things.

473
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,159
We accept the challenge.

474
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,062
Well, thank you, sir.

475
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:19,999
With all due respect, we're gonna kick your ass.

476
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,334
You're gonna replay what game?

477
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,836
I'm sick of games, Jack.

478
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,905
I'm sick of hearing about some ball you dropped.

479
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,007
I'm sick of anything with a ball in it.

480
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,578
Let me rephrase somewhat my intentions.

481
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:34,681
What I propose to do, stated rather simply,

482
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,749
is to remake history.

483
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,985
Pass the lima beans, please, Dad.

484
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,323
We are gonna blitz like Dick Butkus

485
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,692
into the backfield of the future

486
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,561
and throw a vicious forearm shiver

487
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,732
on the demon ball carriers of the past.

488
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,535
I don't want to talk about Dick Butkus
at the dinner table, Jack.

489
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,504
- I've told you that.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,971
Who's Dick Butkus?

491
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,340
All-American linebacker for
the University of Illinois.

492
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,175
Eleven years all-pro with the Chicago Bears.

493
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,011
Now he's doing light beer commercials.

494
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,946
I still don't want to talk
about him at the dinner table.

495
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:07,980
That's fine, Elly.

496
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,516
But this town is still headed

497
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,883
right into the bowels of hell.

498
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,520
And only a great victory can
act as an enema for its soul.

499
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,955
Ew, that is gross, Dad.

500
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,357
- Sorry.
- Can I be excused?

501
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,727
Can't we stay at the table
and talk like other families?

502
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:24,531
Entre.

503
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:27,033
Another thing, Jack, I'm sick
of having a doorbell that plays

504
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,635
the Taft Midway Union High School alma mater.

505
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,437
- It is a great tune, El!
- Can I be excused?

506
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,239
I don't like to listen when you fight.

507
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,609
- It's not a fight, honey. It's a disagreement.
- It's a disagreement.

508
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,977
I forgot.

509
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,812
Did you finish your thank-you notes?

510
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,581
- Oui.
- Okay.

511
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,716
You guys be--

512
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,255
Jaki, you don't need those sunglasses inside.

513
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,760
She thinks I am a fool.

514
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,162
No, she doesn't. I do.

515
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,565
I've lived with that goddamn
dropped ball for thirteen years!

516
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,567
I knew you weren't happy.

517
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,569
I'm only unhappy when you
talk about happiness, Jack.

518
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,571
The rest of the time, I never think about it.

519
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,439
That's why we're gonna kill Bakersfield, Elly.

520
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,275
Jack, if you play that game again,

521
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,678
you will humiliate me,
you will humiliate the town,

522
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:14,581
and you will humiliate yourself
worse than you can ever imagine.

523
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,849
So, you don't think I can
catch the damn ball, do you?

524
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,218
I don't care if you catch it or
drop it or sit on the damn thing.

525
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,888
- How can I live with someone who doesn't care?
- Jack, you're torturing me!

526
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,924
Elly! I come up with the meaning
of life, and you call it torture?

527
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,967
I hate it when we shout.

528
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,704
Me, too.

529
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:41,007
Jaki's out of the house.

530
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,275
Mr. Weasel's here.

531
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,279
Bon appetit.

532
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,818
Oh, Jack.

533
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,822
Elly, I've got a new move for you.

534
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,289
Show me.

535
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,325
It's part Smokey Robinson,

536
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,194
part Gladys Knight, but it's all me.

537
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,633
Jack. Aquarius.

538
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,036
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta satisfy.

539
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,942
Sort of a white Pip.

540
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,310
I love it.

541
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,746
I love that we can have sex after we fight.

542
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:26,919
We do fight about stupid things.

543
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,020
Stupid?

544
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,490
The game. Give me a kiss, Jack.

545
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,860
Honey, let me clarify something.

546
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,229
Just because we're making up
after our fight or disagreement...

547
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,765
- Yes.
- ...doesn't necessarily

548
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:42,534
mean that the terms of that
fight or that disagreement

549
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,236
are necessarily resolved.

550
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,805
Am I right?

551
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,540
Honey, I've always given you

552
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,777
every Monday night of every
fall for thirteen years

553
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,812
so you could watch football.

554
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,414
I've always given you all post-season games,

555
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,549
and most bowl games,

556
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,786
excluding, of course,
the Hula Bowl and Blue-Gray game

557
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:04,991
which coincide with our annual theater
production at the Petroleum Club.

558
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,928
You've been more than fair.

559
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:12,031
But for the last few years

560
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,100
and the last few months,

561
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,568
your demons have become my demons,

562
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,905
and quite frankly, baby...

563
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,142
I can't take it anymore.

564
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,611
Oh. Who can?

565
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:30,349
Not to mention, if you play that game again,

566
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,820
I'll have to put up with a
whole new fresh batch of crap

567
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,288
from my father.

568
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:41,560
Oh. I am playing that game again, El.

569
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,964
Jack, if you play that game again,

570
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,633
you're not sleeping in this bed.

571
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,302
Honey, now who's torturing who?

572
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,404
You mean it's a tough choice?

573
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,841
Of course it is. I love you, but--

574
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,876
Take your pick, Jack.

575
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,845
Mmm.

576
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:01,914
Me...

577
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,150
- or the game.
- Baby.

578
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,484
- Huh?
- Baby.

579
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,754
Yeah? Which is it?

580
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,787


581
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,947
Jesus!

582
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,118
Get out of here or I'll kick your ass.

583
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:15,254


584
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,456
That was a cat.

585
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,828
You've got an hour to clear out.

586
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,263
Don't be here when I get back.

587
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,854
Right.

588
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,962
Oh, that's a nice sky.

589
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,997
Looks like Taft.

590
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,706
This time I think she's gonna
leave me even if I don't fix her car.

591
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,710
Well, I know how you can get her back.

592
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,047
- No, you don't, Jack.
- Oh, yes, I do, Reno.

593
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,917
I really do. Come on.

594
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:20,519
I want to show you something.

595
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,657
Pose for me.

596
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,193
What?

597
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:28,895
Nobody could pose for
football pictures like you.

598
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,596
Oh, my God.

599
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,798
Just give me that one where
you're stiff-armin' the tackler,

600
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,733
- and your right arm is cocked for the quick release.
- Jack.

601
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,003
Jack, you can't play that game again!

602
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:40,139
You know what Schutte'd say to that.

603
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,141
"The words of Lucifer."

604
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,212
"Are you horny to win, now,
come on, you commie pissant?"

605
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,780
"Let's play some football!" Remember?

606
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,549
You were wearing those home whites.

607
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,784
Gigi loved you in the home whites.

608
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,286
And you had on those goddamn white shoes.

609
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,222
You were the only quarterback
in the history of Kern County

610
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,557
- to have white shoes!
- True.

611
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,459
And we'd run down that long tunnel,

612
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,594
and all of the sudden, the photographers...

613
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,630
"Mr. Hightower." Boom! Boom! Boom!

614
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,034
And the crowd going, "Reno! Reno! Reno!"

615
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,601
They're calling your number now.

616
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,505
"Number 12, Reno Hightower!"

617
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,941
Give me the pose... yes!

618
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,143
Don't forget the teeth! The teeth, yes!

619
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,946
Oh, this means you'll play!

620
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,456
We'd get killed, Jack.

621
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:34,060
You can't remake history
without an offensive line.

622
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,062
We'll get an offensive line.

623
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,529
I don't want to throw the football anymore.

624
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,965
I can't believe that, Reno.

625
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,967
I don't wanna throw a beer can
into a trash bin anymore.

626
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,668
'Cause if I miss, some jerk's gonna say,

627
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:46,238
"Hey, Ren, what's the matter?
Losing the old touch, huh?"

628
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,241
Oh, Jack, I'm not a quarterback anymore.

629
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,411
I'm a van specialist.
And I like it, I'm good at it.

630
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,081
I don't want to play.

631
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,617
Get off your knees, Jack.
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

632
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,221
Reno.

633
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,824
I'm afraid you've put me
in a very difficult position,

634
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,359
but you do owe me something.

635
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:14,233
Oh, come on, Jack, you're not going
to pull that on me? I mean, that's--

636
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,703
Reno, you're behind on your mortgage payments.

637
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,005
Come on, Jack--

638
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,674
And I was thinking if you were our quarterback,

639
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:27,246
we might be able to arrange
a little financing for your shop.

640
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,517
Jack, you got no shame at all.

641
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,685
I'm gonna go see the Caribou tomorrow.

642
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,621
And I'd like to be able to tell them

643
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,623
I have the greatest quarterback

644
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,458
in the history of south Kern County.

645
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:46,432
Now, do I hear the variable mortgage
interest rates coming down?

646
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,134
17%.

647
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,868
16%.

648
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,637
Oh. Coming back up again.

649
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,640
Okay, Jack, you tell
the Caribou whatever you want.

650
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,875
But I'm gonna tell you something.

651
00:32:57,043 --> 00:33:00,479
You're a lowlife, blackmailing, chickenshit squid.

652
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,382
"lowlife, blackmailing, chickenshit squid."

653
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,152
Welcome aboard, Reno!

654
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,758
Hey, Reno!

655
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,096
Are you still the Caribou president?

656
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:19,931


657
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,433
That answer your question for you?

658
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,235
Leaves no doubt. Give me a beer.

659
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:28,074
Charlie, I got to ask you a question.

660
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,142
Do you think Taft's lethargic?

661
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,444
You're damn right it is. And proud of it.

662
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:36,182
You don't think we oughta rise up out of lethargy

663
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,285
and breathe new life into the bowels of our soul?

664
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,788
Hell no. We got it made. No one bothers us.

665
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:46,625
You know, half million people
move into L.A. every year,

666
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,095
and make it crowded and miserable.

667
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,297
You know how many people
moved into Taft last year?

668
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,099
Just Arthur and Earl.

669
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,234
That's right. Just Arthur and Earl.

670
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,236
If you ask me, Arthur's
not gonna last much longer.

671
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:58,804
Come here, Charlie.

672
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:02,941
Jack Dundee will be coming in here.

673
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,744
He's got a crazy idea he needs the men of Taft.

674
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,414
Now, he's gonna tell you that
I'm a part of it, but I'm not.

675
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,682
Whatever he asks,

676
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,519
you just tell him no.

677
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,721
Anything for a brother Caribou.

678
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,133
In short, gentlemen,

679
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:31,137
we really need the men of Taft

680
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,573
to forge from the foundry of history

681
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,977
a new past, and by extension, a new future

682
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,447
with, hopefully, a new present

683
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,150
caught in the middle.

684
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,152
In closing, I just have to say,

685
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,220
Bakersfield must be destroyed!

686
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,498
Motion's on the floor.

687
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,000
Any motion on court will try to
need the second. That second?

688
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,236
- Second. 
- Furthermore, any motion from an outside party

689
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:07,005
not on the agenda is defined by
the bylaws requires a second second

690
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,374
before discussion if we want discussion.

691
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:09,741
- Second second?
- Second second.

692
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,076
- Discussion?
- Discussion.

693
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,212
- Second.
- Chair wishes to thank Mac Lynch

694
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,814
our sergeant at arms emeritus for
his help in seconding these motions,

695
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,184
and opens the floor to discussing the motion

696
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,186
that Taft challenge Bakersfield

697
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,687
to settle for once and for all

698
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,755
the question of who-- or is it whom?

699
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,056
- Who.
- Second.

700
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,393
Who was the best--

701
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,328
Bestest. Best. Bestest.

702
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,263
Best. Better.

703
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,631
Second.

704
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,600
Better team in 1972.

705
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,435
Discussion.

706
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,438
I'd like to go on record
as saying I despise Bakersfield

707
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:42,574
- as much as any man in this room.
- Second!

708
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,411
However, the last thing we need
is to get our butts whipped again

709
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,613
by some giant metropolitan city

710
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,681
that has an unfair advantage anyway.

711
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,684
- Exactly.
- Sounds to me like you're scared.

712
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,086
- Yeah, that you'll drop the damn ball!
- You fat--

713
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,089
Order, order, order! Order unto the caribou!

714
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,091
- I'm okay.
- Brother Caribou.

715
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:03,695
Brother Caribou, let's not rush to judgment.

716
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:07,366
Jack may have stumbled across
the edge of an idea here.

717
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:10,336
I say if Jack, who screwed up so badly

718
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,271
on that dark night many years ago,

719
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,240
is willing to replay the game,

720
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,343
then we oughta throw our antlers
in the ring, and kick some ass.

721
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:20,145
Yeah! Kick some ass.

722
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:23,249
Nobody hates the scum
of Bakersfield worse than I do.

723
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,584
But half the old team lives out of town,

724
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,254
the half that don't is in miserable shape.

725
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,157
Felipe Rivero's in Fresno,
Luther Jackson lives up in San Jose.

726
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:35,160
Not to mention our whole
offensive line moved away.

727
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,596
Where's Mando and Bam Bam and Dickie LaRue?

728
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,498
We'll get them back, and we will get in shape.

729
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:42,100
- We're not organized.
- We'll get organized.

730
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,535
It's against the laws of bylaws.

731
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,537
What? Getting in shape?

732
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,373
Shit no. Getting organized.

733
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:50,108
Have we no dignity or pride?

734
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,778
- I object to your insinuations!
- Charlie, you can't object!

735
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,613
Sit down, Jack!

736
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,284
Order to the Caribou! Order to the Caribou!

737
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,452
Lodge bellow! Lodge bellow!

738
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,454


739
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,623


740
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,658


741
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,629
I say in summation,

742
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,832
that Jack's idea is, no offense,
sprinkled with horseshit.

743
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,501
Discussion over!

744
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,869
Now, all those who think Jack's proposition

745
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,139
is sprinkled with horseshit signify by saying aye.

746
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,608
Aye!

747
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,310
- Opposed?
- No!

748
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,945
- No!
- The ayes are above the nos.

749
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,914
I propose we head for the bar.

750
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,916
- Second!
- Meeting adjourned!

751
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,860


752
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,897
Marcy, I told you never disturb me here.

753
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,334
Excuse me for interrupting
you in your study, sir,

754
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,336
but the colonel's on the phone.
Marcy, I can't talk--

755
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,804
- Jack!
- Hello, Herbert. What's happening?

756
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,408
I got a problem.
Nobody here wants to play the game.

757
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,710
You having any luck over there?

758
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,013
There's a lot of excitement
right here at the moment, sir.

759
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,352
Oh, well, I got no players,
no coaches, nothing.

760
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,819
Oh, my God.

761
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,657
I don't suppose there's any way
I can get out of this thing.

762
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,993
You've put me in a difficult position,

763
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:19,365
because everyone in this town
is giddy with expectation.

764
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,733
I suppose I could

765
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,603
find it in my heart to let you off the hook,

766
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:27,473
but you'll owe me one, of course.

767
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:29,375
Jack-o, just kidding!

768
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:32,010
- You went for the fake as usual.
- Pardon me?

769
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,916
Jack, say hello to Tony Tiger!

770
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,885
Grr!

771
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,954
Jack, we're gonna eat you alive.

772
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,391
All right, here are the rules.

773
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,493
Only men from the '72 team can play.

774
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,728
We'll go fifteen minute quarters,

775
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,797
NFL style, one-point conversions.

776
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,532
We're pros, huh, right?

777
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,034
One more thing, iron hands.

778
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,069
When you put on your uniform,

779
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,939
the jockstrap goes on the inside.

780
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,041
Buy me a drink?

781
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,511
Whatever she wants, Chico.

782
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,913
Reno, it's me.

783
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,849
Darla.

784
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,551
Darla Robinson!

785
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,653
My God, I can't bel-- I didn't recognize you!

786
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:50,456
I mean, it's been awhile. What, twelve years?

787
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,090
- Thirteen.
- God.

788
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,536
So, have you seen Jack?

789
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:08,006
Yeah, he drives back and forth
in front of the house every night,

790
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,309
circles the block a couple of times,
and heads off to the motel.

791
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,145
- Seen Reno?
- No.

792
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,216
I think he's been sneaking out to
Darla's for the last couple of months.

793
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,718
- Darla? Please.
- Yeah.

794
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,820
Do you think Jack ever went out there?

795
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,889
Of course not. I'd know the minute that he did.

796
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,599
God, I remember it like it was yesterday.

797
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,335
I was standing on the 50-yard line at halftime.

798
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,338
I was the goddamn Homecoming Queen,

799
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,241
surrounded by rocket princesses.

800
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,876
And pregnant.

801
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,481
Yeah, well, I think we both screwed up.

802
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,483
- Huh?
- Well, what do they want?

803
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,418
Well, it's simple what men want.

804
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,953
What men want is more eye makeup.

805
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,989
Lots and lots of eye makeup.

806
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,626
Heavy liner on the bottom lid.

807
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,061
- Thank you, Linda.
- Come on, not all men.

808
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,364
Hey, Darla,

809
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:10,201
I got to ask you something.

810
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,803
How many touchdown passes did I throw

811
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,739
against Porterville High in '72?

812
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,807
Six. You were terrific.

813
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,977
You were a terrific bastard, too.

814
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,948
- What?
- But we were undefeated, so it was okay.

815
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,083
You seem nicer now.

816
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,586
- Nicer?
- Yeah.

817
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,599
Hit it.

818
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,338
<i>I always dreamed the boy I loved</i>

819
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,841
<i>would come along.</i>

820
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,277


821
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:56,648


822
00:41:56,748 --> 00:42:00,652
<i>And he'd be tall and handsome, rich, and strong.</i>

823
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,287


824
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,724
<i>Now that boy I love has come to me.</i>

825
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,458


826
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:12,664
<i>But it sure ain't the way I thought it would be.</i>

827
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:13,965


828
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,433


829
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,235


830
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,904


831
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,939


832
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,674


833
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,676


834
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:29,648
<i>He don't look like a movie star</i>

835
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:32,618
<i>He don't drive a Cadillac car</i>

836
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,622
<i>Sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of</i>

837
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,356
<i>But sure the boy I love</i>

838
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,691
<i>Let me tell you</i>

839
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,670
<i>When he holds me tight</i>

840
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,039
<i>Everything's right</i>

841
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,275
<i>Crazy as it seems</i>

842
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,178
<i>I'm his wherever he is</i>

843
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,480
<i>And I forget all of my dreams</i>

844
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:04,215
<i>Everybody knows</i>

845
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,952
<i>He doesn't hang diamonds 'round my neck</i>

846
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:10,521
<i>And all he's got's an unemployment check</i>

847
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,524
<i>He sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of</i>

848
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,994
<i>But he's sure the boy I love</i>

849
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,940
<i>I'm his wherever he is</i>

850
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,809
<i>But don't forget all of your dreams</i>

851
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,811
<i>But I love him so</i>

852
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,512
<i>He doesn't hang diamonds 'round your neck</i>

853
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,014
<i>Oh, no</i>

854
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,516
<i>And all he's got's an unemployment check</i>

855
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:41,853
<i>Sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of</i>

856
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,289
<i>But sure the boy I love</i>

857
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,024


858
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,366
Who was that?

859
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,140
Who the hell did that?

860
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,842
Damn tiger!

861
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:06,845
I'm going to kick his ass!

862
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:08,179
I'll kill that bastard.

863
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,348


864
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:24,362
Of all the dirty tricks!

865
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:25,596
There's a lunatic out there.

866
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,033
Lunatic, my ass. It's Bakersfield.

867
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,634
What is going on here?

868
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:31,336
Chickenshit son of a bitches.

869
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,338
It's terrorism.

870
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:36,307
Simple goddamn terrorism.

871
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,843
We've been violated.

872
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:41,046
I don't understand this. That's how they work.

873
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:43,148
Confuse you, then divide and conquer.

874
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,751
- That's how terrorism works, Charlie.
- Absolutely right.

875
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:49,187
- Damn right.
- 1971. That wasn't 42 to nothing.

876
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,189
That was 35 to nothing.

877
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,091
This graffiti's all wrong.

878
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,962
Oh, my God!

879
00:44:58,163 --> 00:44:59,364
Charlie.

880
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,433
They broke my gavel.

881
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,370
Attacking symbols of office and authority.

882
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,774
It's nihilism, I tell you.

883
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,675
They defaced our women.

884
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:14,245
We must redeem our dignity and pride.

885
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,248
We're going to redeem your dignity and pride.

886
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,217
My dignity and pride are just fine, thanks.

887
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,820
- I know you're upset.
- No shit.

888
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,790
- Kill Bakersfield.
- We're gonna kill Bakersfield for you, ma'am!

889
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,259
Well, I don't care. Can you understand that?

890
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,996
She cares. She cares deeply.

891
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:33,999
I propose a vote without
a quorom that Reno Hightower

892
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,135
was the greatest quarterback
in the history of America!

893
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,171
- Yeah!
- Right!

894
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,007
You hear that, Reno?
You're going to play ball again.

895
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:43,909
Who said anybody was replaying anything?

896
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:46,812
Rosie, tell them this is all unnecessary.

897
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,414
Actually, I'd like to have my honor defended.

898
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,448
- Yeah!
- Rosie!

899
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,283
- Go, Rosie.
- Jack, Jack.

900
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,352
Is it too late to get the game on?

901
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,355
Geez, I don't know.

902
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:59,290
Ask Mr. Hightower.

903
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:04,695
Goddamn it.

904
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,898
Let's kill Bakersfield!

905
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:12,570
If I ever find the son of a bitch who did this,

906
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:13,671
I'll kill him!

907
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,441
Land of hope and glory

908
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,945
'Neath the azure skies

909
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:23,849
Where our friendships are welded

910
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:27,919
Ever bonded our ties

911
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,489
Getting in shape isn't enough.

912
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,491
To remake history, we need an edge.

913
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,994
We don't need an edge. We need an offensive line.

914
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:13,899
We need Felipe and Mando, Bam Bam, Dickie LaRue!

915
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,009
Felipe!

916
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:26,011
Bam Bam!

917
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,412
Mando.

918
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,014
Mando.

919
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:31,917
- Bam Bam.
- Bam Bam!

920
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:34,019
Dickie LaRue!

921
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,222
Return to the scene of their greatest triumphs.

922
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,456
Ready!

923
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,927
Set! Hut!

924
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,299
Hut! Hut!

925
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,611
Our offensive line sounds
like a tuberculosis ward.

926
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,281
- We got to get scientific.
- What do you mean?

927
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,985
- Aerobics.
- What?

928
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,519
One...two...

929
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,355
three...four...

930
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:11,556
and one...

931
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,557
two...

932
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:13,558
three...

933
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:14,592
four...

934
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,094
and one, two, three.

935
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:19,364
Don't be afraid to get those legs up there, girls.

936
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:21,066
Yo!

937
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:25,070
- Ho. Hey. Ho.
- Jack.

938
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,140
Yes! Now dessert!

939
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,341
One, two.

940
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,317
Well, what do you think?

941
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:44,422
I think it's pathetic, Jack.

942
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,224
Makes a grown man wanna cry.

943
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:48,126
- We gotta get back to fundamentals.
- No shit.

944
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,294
And how do we do that?

945
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,997
Hup!

946
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:05,010
Men, this is the playbook.

947
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:08,479
There's more than two hundred plays in here.

948
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,116
Learn every damn one of them.

949
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:13,151
What kind of offense will Taft run?

950
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,188
Offense? Well, they're probably
drawing plays in the dirt.

951
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,024
Eddie, this pebble is you.

952
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:20,491
Chico, you're the bottle cap.

953
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,493
All right, you run a post up
here to this piece of glass.

954
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,662
- Right. 
- Man, I thought I was the piece of glass.

955
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,731
You're the twig, goddamn it!

956
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:28,466
Twig.

957
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,202
Just go long.

958
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,171
- Okay. On four. Ready? 
- Break!

how to get through to me at all, you know, El?

Okay, honey, just listen to me and...

00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:52,543
remember.

Look at all that phony,
virile, pseudo-macho posing.

1003
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,262
Yeah. They look great.

1004
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:19,597
Yeah.

1005
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,699
Maybe we've been too rough on them.

1006
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,768
I mean, I know you don't wanna see Reno,

1007
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,103
but I'm thinking maybe I could ask Jack to dinner.

1008
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,838
I mean, just to talk, of course.

1009
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,374
Shit, are you caving in?

1010
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:31,509
- No!
- I hope not.

1011
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,978
There'd be very, very strict ground rules.

1012
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,549
What kind of ground rules?

1013
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:52,397
Well, we shouldn't have too much
trouble with the ground rules.

1014
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:54,865
- What ground rules?
- Oh, didn't I tell you?

1015
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,401
There's only two things we can't talk about.

1016
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,804
- What?
- Football and sex.

1017
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,906
Oh.

1018
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:04,909
Jesus, what do we talk about?

1019
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,413
What are we gonna talk about?

1020
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:09,947
We'll just steer clear of anything personal.

1021
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,816
Don't make it too hard on them.

1022
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:16,887
Okay. Then what if they
pass the Monday night test?

1023
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,990
Then we can get personal.

1024
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,759
I'm not getting personal.

1025
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:25,930
I don't care how good they look.

1026
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,998
- How do I look?
- You look hot.

1027
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,370
I look like a dork.
You look hot. You look great.

1028
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,441
What are we going to talk about?

1029
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,743
What are we going to talk about?

1030
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,978
Go with the flow, Reno

1031
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,180
I figure if things go well tonight,

1032
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:45,783
the old magical glow could kick in.

1033
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,017
We might even score.

1034
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,653
Jack, we got to be careful.

1035
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:52,056
You're right, careful,
with just a hint of reckless.

1036
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:54,024
They like that.

1037
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,595
Women and the game. We could have it all.

1038
00:54:57,695 --> 00:55:00,765
Jack, I want my wife back. Don't screw this up.

1039
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:04,902
Hey, me? I'm in control.

1040
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,604
- Hey, Dad.
- Teddy.

1041
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:08,473
- Hi, Mr. Dundee.
- Hi, Blade.

1042
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:09,940
We didn't think you'd show up tonight.

1043
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,642
- Why not?
- It's Monday night.

1044
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,210
Atlanta-Minnesota.

1045
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,880
My God! Monday Night Football.

1046
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,484
Jesus. They scheduled it on Monday
night on purpose. They're testing us.

1047
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:20,551
Doesn't really matter.

1048
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,619
Atlanta and Minnesota have lost

1049
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:23,621
Seventeen straight games between them.

1050
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,491
- Yeah, even we don't want to watch them.
- Yeah.

1051
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,394
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Jaki.

1052
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,464
- She's glad you came.
- Tell her I love her.

1053
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,500
Hey, Teddy.

1054
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:49,914


1055
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,682
What are we going to talk about again?

1056
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,083
It doesn't matter.

1057
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,987
Do not take sides, at all costs. No arguments.

1058
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,758
Be bland and be strong.

1059
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,760
Bland and strong.

1060
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,432
- Hello.
- Hi.

1061
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,500
It smells super.

1062
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,636
The food.

1063
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:13,738
Better than super.

1064
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:15,940
It's really, really super.

1065
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,443
Aw, that's sweet of you.

1066
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,445
Yeah. Thanks.

1067
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:33,758
Well, we've got a lot to talk about.

1068
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,760
Where do we start?

1069
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,929
Well, we thought maybe we could talk about,

1070
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:42,467
for example, the world.

1071
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,234
Just for starters.

1072
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:45,703
- Yeah.
- Great.

1073
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:48,739
- Sure.
- You know, I just can't get a handle

1074
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:52,977
- on the Middle East.
- It's a swamp. A real mess.

1075
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,945
Don't you think so, Rene?

1076
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,648
Yeah, it's a swamp.

1077
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,050
You think, honey?

1078
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,819
- Th--that it's a swamp?
- Yeah.

1079
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,021
Hey, absolutely.

1080
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,756
Yeah, I thought so.

1081
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:09,560
You know, it's probably too
complex to talk about over dinner.

1082
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,330
Well, hey, you know, there's
always the nuclear question.

1083
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:16,100
Since Taft's the safest city in America...

1084
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,635
I think that

1085
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:20,805
that whole area is another swamp, too.

1086
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,373
But a very complex one,

1087
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:26,577
a swamp with many levels of
political overtones and resonances

1088
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,646
that can't be fathomed at the present time,

1089
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:31,048
but need the distance of the
future to give it a perspective

1090
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,050
so you can truly have a point of view

1091
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,520
and realize the viscosity of that quagmire.

1092
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,354
And the only way to understand this is to realize

1093
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,156
that it's incomprehensible.

1094
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,994
Yeah, it's kind of like the shop.

1095
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,630
We're chopping up a Caprice,

1096
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,565
taking the dings out of a Nova.

1097
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,635
Whew!

1098
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:53,704
I've had a little too much wine. Excuse me.

1099
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,405
Doing good.

1100
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,241
Just try and tie it together.

1101
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:12,557


1102
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:21,065
How about acid rain, huh?

1103
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:27,572
So, what have you guys been up to?

1104
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:29,139
Oh, gee, it's busy, you know.

1105
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,575
- Yeah.
- Oh, busy.

1106
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:32,910
Just really, really busy, I bet.

1107
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,178
Uh-huh.

1108
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:36,581
- Really.
- Yeah.

1109
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,085
- No score.
- What?

1110
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,153
- My throat's a little sore.
- Excuse me.

1111
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,955
I think I'm gonna have to use
the little boy's room, too.

1112
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:47,157
- Acid rain.
- You got it.

1113
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,660
Well, that's a swamp, too.

1114
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,596
Because with all that acidity,

1115
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,497
you won't find your normal
swamp creatures flourishing.

1116
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:56,500
They need salinity to survive.

1117
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,703
Now, what is it that's the swamp?

1118
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:01,105
What Jack was talking about.

1119
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,740
Yes.

1120
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,874
That's dessert.

1121
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,043
I'll get it. Let's go together.

1122
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,716
Reno hasn't looked this good in years.

1123
00:59:11,816 --> 00:59:14,719
Gigi, have I been drinking too much,

1124
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,154
or does Jack actually look sexy?

1125
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,189
No! They're both hot.

1126
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,726
And they're so goddamn well-behaved.

1127
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:24,729
They're afraid to open their mouths.

1128
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,636
They don't even know it's Monday night.

1129
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,638
- See? I told you we can have it all.
- Okay, great.

1130
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,205
- The women and the game.
- Okay, great.

1131
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,741
Now, just turn it off.

1132
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,243
- Fumble!
- Vikes' ball.

1133
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,078
- It's Atlanta's ball.
- Vikes' ball.

1134
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:43,648
- Look, it's Atlanta's ball!
- Atlanta's ball.

1135
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:44,949
Where are you studs?

1136
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,951
Okay, get in the bathroom. I'll cover for you.

1137
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:47,985
Women and the game.

1138
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,988
- Turn it off, Jack.
- You got it.

1139
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,557
Well, guess who's in the bathroom again?

1140
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:55,225
- Again.
- Is there something wrong with the wine?

1141
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,261
No. It's super.

1142
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,263
It's-- I don't know, it's
running right through me and Jack.

1143
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:02,499
- I can tell it's the good stuff, though.
- Yeah.

1144
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:06,570
Well, hey, how about Beirut, huh?

1145
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,572
What do you know about Beirut?

1146
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:12,609
Beirut. "He da best damn
baseball player ebber live!"

1147
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,613
That's so funny!

1148
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,150
Isn't that great?

1149
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,353
Oh...let's face it.

1150
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:28,425
We don't have to talk about
important issues tonight.

1151
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,094
We can talk about life.

1152
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:32,997
Yeah, what the hell.

1153
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:36,300
- You look great.
- So do you.

1154
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,268
You know, Jack and I used to refer

1155
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:41,271
to the magical glow of things.

1156
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,108
Well, I think it's about time we all
tried to get a little of that back.

1157
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,544
You know, things are going so well tonight.

1158
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,514
I thought maybe we could talk
a little bit about marriage.

1159
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,717
Where were we?

1160
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:54,819
International trade imbalance,

1161
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,021
the Pope?

1162
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,256
I'm having a ball.

1163
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,591
You know, the thought has occurred to me,

1164
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:04,194
that we could go around this table,

1165
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,864
each one of us individually listing our cases,

1166
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,098
as it were,

1167
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,967
and stating our gripes and grievances about

1168
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:12,336
our marital prob--

1169
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:13,971
Honey, what's the matter?

1170
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,840
You know, I think there's
something wrong with the wine.

1171
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,776
No, no, no, it's a...

1172
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,177
a muscle cramp.

1173
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:23,147
Well, why don't we come around
there and rub your backs?

1174
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,849
- No!
- No!

1175
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:29,787
- No, we want to sit here and look at you.
- Right!

1176
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:33,858
And we want to be able to sit here

1177
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,492
and look at--

1178
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,427
Looking good!

1179
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:43,100
We're just a couple of party cossacks.

1180
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,501
Party! Oh!

1181
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:46,937
I do love you, Jack.

1182
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,340
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time.

1183
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,810
- Good hands.
- What?

1184
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,013
Oh, your little cold hands.

1185
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:59,183
Well, they're not that cold.

1186
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:01,786
Easy. Four seconds.

1187
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:06,223
Did you say that we're okay for sex?

1188
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:09,794
- It's about time.
- Baby.

1189
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,797
You know, you're looking so good tonight.

1190
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,065
I was wondering if you thought maybe if it was--

1191
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,934
God, what a catch!

1192
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,004
Oh, my God, Jack!

1193
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:22,006
- Who put that there?
- Oh, my God!

1194
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:24,909
- Atlanta-Minnesota! Jesus, Jack.
- It's entrapment!

1195
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,211
Entrapment, Jack? They're 0 and 17 between them!

1196
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,047
My God! Jack, get out!

1197
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:40,257
Well, Mr. We-Can-Have-It-All, what do we do now?

1198
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:41,892
Ask him to turn the sound up.

1199
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:44,161
There's still the postgame highlights.

1200
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:48,833
You are full of shit, Jack.

1201
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:53,670
In every way that is possible for
a person to be full of it, you are!

1202
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:56,706
Even your bullshit is bullshit.

1203
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,843
You know, you once said to me you liked the way

1204
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:01,478
I could command respect on a
football team without saying much.

1205
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:04,014
Well, I was always amazed at the way

1206
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:07,017
you could make so much noise
without doing anything.

1207
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:12,622
There's a style there,

1208
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:14,224
a confidence.

1209
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:17,294
Really, Jack, you're a
decent human being basically.

1210
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,964
You're just full of shit.

1211
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,365
What are you implying, Reno?

1212
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,035
That's what I mean! I'm not implying! I'm saying!

1213
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:41,151
You know something, Reno?

1214
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,721
In kindergarten, I had it all.

1215
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:45,755
I was the first to memorize

1216
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,258
The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.

1217
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:49,894
In 6th grade,

1218
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,564
I was voted most likely to succeed.

1219
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,102
In 12th grade, I won the Caribou Lodge
Purple Mountains' Majesty,

1220
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,637
Amber Waves of Grain
Youth Essay Contest. Remember?

1221
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:04,909
- It was called God, My Friend.
- My Friend.

1222
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:07,044
- Hell of an essay, too.
- Thanks.

1223
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,316
I had a future,

1224
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:15,252
until I went out for football.

1225
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:20,124
Because from 22 minutes past nine o'clock

1226
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:23,627
on the night of November 15, 1972,

1227
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:25,930
until now, I've simply been known

1228
01:04:25,996 --> 01:04:30,800
as the man who dropped the ball.

1229
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,038
Oh, God. I want Elly back.

1230
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:37,607
Yeah, why can't it be as easy
as it is on the football field?

1231
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,144
They put their panties on
one leg at a time, don't they?

1232
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:43,213
Who knows anymore? They might
just hop in both legs at once.

1233
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:44,949
Have you told Elly you think you're a bad lover?

1234
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:47,817
Of course not. She knows.

1235
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:50,988
And if she doesn't, I don't
wanna give her any clues.

1236
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:52,422
Jack...

1237
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,424
my bazooka's dead.

1238
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:56,260
Don't tell me this.

1239
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,827
Oh, man, my arm.

1240
01:04:57,962 --> 01:04:59,863
I can't throw the ball well anymore.

1241
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:02,199
- You're great.
- I was never great. I was pretty good.

1242
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:03,533
I was great for around here.

1243
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,970
Every year I got better.

1244
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,637
People remember me in my prime.

1245
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,638
The kids always ask me

1246
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,340
about the six touchdown passes

1247
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,076
I threw against Porterville.

1248
01:05:12,176 --> 01:05:14,478
- Hell, I only threw three touchdowns.
- It was seven.

1249
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,846
I'm not gonna argue.
I like the idea of seven better.

1250
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,448
Couple more years, it'll be up to eight.

1251
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:20,985
I get better with age.

1252
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,553
Man, my knees are killing me. I'm slow.

1253
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,423
That's why you didn't want to play the game?

1254
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:30,827
No. I just...

1255
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,062
I didn't want to destroy

1256
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:34,364
the only thing I got left.

1257
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:37,467
Those stories about how great I was.

1258
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,207
You want to know something else?

1259
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,610
Bakersfield is loaded.

1260
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:50,380
One, two, three, four, five,

1261
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,117
six, seven, eight,

1262
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:54,584
nine, ten,

1263
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,221
eleven, twelve, thirteen...

1264
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,657
it's the worst goddamn idea I've ever had.

1265
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:03,127


1266
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,533
We're not going to revive the town.

1267
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,035
We're going to destroy it.

1268
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:17,541
You think it's too late to call off the game?

1269
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,145
Christ, Jack, it's even too late
to get out of the dance.

1270
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:24,248
<i>Don't say nothin' bad about my baby</i>

1271
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:25,582
<i>Oh, no</i>

1272
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,551
<i>Don't say nothin' bad about my baby</i>

1273
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,153
<i>I love him so</i>

1274
01:06:29,253 --> 01:06:32,156
<i>Don't say nothin' bad about my baby</i>

1275
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:35,225
<i>Don't say nothin' bad about my baby</i>

1276
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,660
<i>He's good</i>

1277
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,062
<i>He's good
He's good to me</i>

1278
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:39,363
<i>Good to me</i>

1279
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,798
<i>And that's all I care about</i>

1280
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:43,733
Elly's not coming.

1281
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,769
Oh, she'll be here, Jack.

1282
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:48,772
She wants to see her old friends, she'll make it.

1283
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,708
Better?

1284
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:55,445
That is disgusting.

1285
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,614
Mom, what is this game all about?

1286
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,516
I really want to understand.

1287
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:02,086
Well, in your life, isn't there something

1288
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:04,621
that you wish you'd done differently?

1289
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,791
If you could do it over,
you'd change things somehow?

1290
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,161
No.

1291
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:16,166
Well, maybe you have to be
a grown-up to understand.

1292
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:17,867
T-A-

1293
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:19,436
F-T.

1294
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,105
Taft!

1295
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,473
That was Gigi and the Blenders!

1296
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:27,711
Let's give a good hand!

1297
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,414
Direct your attention to the rocket ship.

1298
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:32,549
Welcome back Luther Jackson,

1299
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:33,783
the greatest running back

1300
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,154
in the history of Kern County!

1301
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:43,127
What a pleasure to be back to one's roots!

1302
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,561
- Mando!
- How you doing, man?

1303
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,563
Lighten up, brother. Lighten up. Lighten up, man.

1304
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,631


1305
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,865


1306
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:49,999


1307
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:51,235


1308
01:07:51,335 --> 01:07:52,669


1309
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,538


1310
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:56,005


1311
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,006


1312
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,208


1313
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,409


1314
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:00,510


1315
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,978


1316
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:03,980


1317
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:05,582


1318
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:08,652
Reno, look.

1319
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,287
What do I do now?

1320
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,021
- Be cool.
- Be what?

1321
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,023


1322
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:16,160


1323
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,595
She's going straight to Gigi...

1324
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:20,297
Yeah, and...

1325
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:23,300
Right to the ladies' room.

1326
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,169


1327
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:27,671


1328
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,639
This whole thing is a joke, Gigi.

1329
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:31,175
He has revived Taft.

1330
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,042
Jack's doing everything
he said he was going to do.

1331
01:08:33,177 --> 01:08:35,712
I know. It's amazing, ain't it?

1332
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:40,184
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

1333
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,751
Dance with the son of a bitch.

1334
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:44,288
- Why should I?
- Because you want to.

1335
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:46,190
That's not a good reason.

1336
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:51,561
Well, then do it because this is
his moment in the sun, here tonight.

1337
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,698
No, tomorrow is Jack's moment
in the sun-- the game.

1338
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:57,801
No, it's not, it's tonight
while there's still hope,

1339
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,405
because tomorrow Bakersfield's
just gonna slaughter us.

1340
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,578
They've been in there forever.

1341
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:10,514
What the hell are they talking about?

1342
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,115
- Hey, Jack-o!
- Reno!

1343
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:15,552
I can't believe you guys
pulled this thing off.

1344
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:19,122
Day after tomorrow, Taft will
never forget the name Jack Dundee.

1345
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:21,225
We were just talking about
the eight touchdown passes

1346
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,227
you threw against Porterville,
it was incredible!

1347
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:27,231
Yeah, well, you don't throw eight TD's
in a game without great protection.

1348
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:29,299
Tomorrow, I'm gonna need all I can get.

1349
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:32,336
- We're a lean, mean fighting machine!
- Yeah!

1350
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:40,444


1351
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:41,645
I'm dancing.

1352
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:46,350


1353
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:57,661


1354
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,331


1355
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:13,710


1356
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,882


1357
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:20,850
Elly, is that you?

1358
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,355
Well, if it isn't,

1359
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,957
just disregard everything you're about to hear.

1360
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,163
You once told me to choose

1361
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,334
between you and the game.

1362
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:38,602
Well...

1363
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:42,171
I got it wrong.

1364
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:46,743
Tomorrow we're gonna get our ass kicked.

1365
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,712
I know I have no right to ask you anything

1366
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:49,779
at a time like this.

1367
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:52,181


1368
01:10:52,382 --> 01:10:54,183
It would be very nice...

1369
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:55,385


1370
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:57,153
...if you could come out here

1371
01:10:57,354 --> 01:11:00,324
and dance with me.

1372
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:01,758


1373
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,760
Elly?

1374
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,830


1375
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,032
Those are your feet, aren't they?

1376
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:21,345


1377
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:28,084
Jack. Aquarius.

1378
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:31,087


1379
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:34,558


1380
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:43,867


1381
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,436


1382
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:54,243


1383
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:59,683


1384
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,856


1385
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:14,398


1386
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:24,674


1387
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:33,049
El?

1388
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:35,919
What do you want?

1389
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:40,056
I want you...

1390
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:42,759
to kill Bakersfield.

1391
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,028


1392
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,095
Okay.

1393
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:50,500


1394
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:56,773


1395
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:02,045


1396
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:20,924
Do you do that left to right

1397
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,959
or right to left?

1398
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,728
Both ways. Just in case.

1399
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:25,862
Yeah.

1400
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:29,599
You Catholic?

1401
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,601
At the moment.

1402
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,969
Excuse me.

1403
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:42,712
Thank you, Jack.

1404
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,851
- Well, Jack, here we are.
- Yeah.

1405
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,053
You finally got what you wanted.

1406
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,621
What wretched luck.

1407
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,758
Oh, relax, Jack. You're going to be a hero.

1408
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:57,393
And what if I'm not?

1409
01:14:57,594 --> 01:14:59,629
It's just a game.

1410
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:02,866


1411
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:04,033


1412
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,936


1413
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,674
Just a game.

1414
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,815
Look alive.

1415
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:19,883
Go, Jack!

1416
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:25,188
Kickoff time, sports fans.

1417
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,657
As outlined against the blue-grey November sky,

1418
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,659
the four horsemen ride again.

1419
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,260
In days of yore, they were known

1420
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,730
as disease, famine, pestilence, and death.

1421
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,066
We're really gonna need some luck tonight.
There's no such thing as luck.

1422
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:41,705


1423
01:15:41,805 --> 01:15:43,740


1424
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,342
A end over end kick,

1425
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:49,613
coming down to number 34.

1426
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:52,448
He's at the five, the ten, the fiften.

1427
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:55,284
The quick reverse to Johnny-O! I can't look.

1428
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:05,895
Touchdown! Johnny-O, Bakersfield.

1429
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,967
Had to be Johnny-O.

1430
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:15,304
You lucky son of a bitch!

1431
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:19,008
Swing it, swing it, swing it, yeah!

1432
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,745
All right! Yeah!

1433
01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:24,480
What did that take? Four seconds?

1434
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:25,915
Come on, nail them!

1435
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:27,784
The kick is good.

1436
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:30,119
Bakersfield, seven, Taft, zero.

1437
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:33,089
- You a rocket or a pissant?
- A rocket!

1438
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:41,130
Goddamn it! Come back here!

1439
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,201
Let's go!

1440
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:53,309
I don't want to sound biased or anything, Arturo,

1441
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:57,847
but I think we have a real lean,
green war machine down there on that field.

1442
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,016
Okay, hogs, let's see what kind of shape you're in.

1443
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,351
Quick pitch to Luther on one. Ready? Break.

1444
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,253
- You a rocket or a pissant?
- I'm a rocket!

1445
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,956
- Show me! Show me!
- He's a rocket!

1446
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,558
Set! Hut!

1447
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:11,695
Pitch to Luther Jackson.

1448
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,030
He's down at the five.

1449
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,302
Same play, other side. On one. Ready?

1450
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:20,536
Break!

1451
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:22,739
Set! Hut!

1452
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,143
Luther Jackson down at the two.

1453
01:17:28,712 --> 01:17:32,115
Oh. It's like playing my sister.

1454
01:17:32,215 --> 01:17:33,983
Third and 18, Rockets.

1455
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:37,020
- Come on, let's do it.
- I love this game. Gotta throw the ball.

1456
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,723
Luther, split right, run a
straight fly. Any safety bound.

1457
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,557
Jack, post pattern on four, and be careful.

1458
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:43,960
- They got Dr. Death covering you.
- No sweat.

1459
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,095
- I thought he was still in jail.
- No, he's on parole.

1460
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:48,865
- Parole?
- On four. Ready, break.

1461
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:53,269
Yeah, come on over here, 99.

1462
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:56,172
I'm going to take the rest of your teeth out.

1463
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,574
- Yeah!
- On four, on four.

1464
01:17:58,742 --> 01:17:59,876
- Open your eyes, punk!
- Ready?

1465
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:02,578
- You heard me.
- On four.

1466
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,580
- On four. On four.
- Set!

1467
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:06,615
- On four.
- Hut!

1468
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,752
Where you running, rabbit? Come on back here.

1469
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:09,853
You gotta wait for the ball.

1470
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:13,022
I'm open, I'm open, I'm open.

1471
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:16,025
Come on!

1472
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,327
Illegal procedure on number 99,

1473
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,595
Jack Dundee.

1474
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:22,298
Great move, Jack. You're wide open.

1475
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:40,917
Go!

1476
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:41,918
Whoa!

1477
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:43,119
Six points.

1478
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,320
Yeah!

1479
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:51,795
Off to a great start, huh, Jack?

1480
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:55,064
In the first quarter,
Taft, nothing, Bakersfield, 13.

1481
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,232
Johnny-O.

1482
01:18:56,332 --> 01:18:58,201
- Johnny-O.
- Key on O!

1483
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,369
Reverse!

1484
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,872
Look at this, guys! Here it is!

1485
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,040
Woo!

1486
01:19:07,143 --> 01:19:08,978
Yeah!

1487
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:12,215
The score is Bakersfield, 20, Taft, nothing.

1488
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:13,249
Go, go!

1489
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:14,951
Kill somebody!

1490
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:19,522
Incomplete pass from Hightower.

1491
01:19:24,828 --> 01:19:26,830
Get up, Jack!

1492
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,238
Reno Hightower thrown for a loss of 12 yards.

1493
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:36,472
Hut!

1494
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,641
Hey, man, you play like you got nothing.

1495
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:39,843
Ready!

1496
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:42,946
Set!

1497
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:57,861


1498
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,505
A long pass complete to Johnny-O

1499
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,640
at the 30, 25, 20...

1500
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,976
it's a touchdown!

1501
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:15,111
Johnny-O of Bakersfield.

1502
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,180
I love it!

1503
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,115
Give me a high five!

1504
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:20,449
Ow!

1505
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,351
God, Morgan, my knee!

1506
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,120
Goddamn it!

1507
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,855
Jeez!

1508
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:27,891
Is there a doctor in the house?

1509
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,026
We're coming.

1510
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:34,763
- Oh, shit!
- Call my mom.

1511
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:37,133
Careful. Watch my knee.

1512
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:39,335


1513
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:41,437
Taft, zero, Bakersfield, 26.

1514
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:44,908


1515
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:48,611
Something's happening to
the blue-grey November sky.

1516
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:51,380
There seems to be a little
turbulence to the north.

1517
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,549
Twenty seconds left in the first half.

1518
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:24,147
Well, it's halftime now,

1519
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:28,051
and it's starting to get a little
bit of a Taft sprinkle here.

1520
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,385
Let's get out of here.

1521
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,787
Halftime statistics, rushing yardage,

1522
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:36,225
Bakersfield, 314 yards, Taft, minus 12.

1523
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:38,394
The weather sucks.

1524
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:41,497
We have a great halftime show for you, folks.

1525
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:43,967
Let's listen to that great mighty Rocket band.

1526
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:48,037


1527
01:22:03,987 --> 01:22:05,854
Sorry, man. Some great passes.

1528
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,823
Should've had them.

1529
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,325
Forget it.

1530
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:33,549
Matthew 14, verse 11.

1531
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:36,019
"Ye shall know the truth,"

1532
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:37,420
"and it shall make you free."

1533
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,322
Amen, coach!

1534
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:42,225
On Monday morning, they'll still be them,

1535
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:44,493
and we'll still be us,

1536
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:48,097
but for the next thirty minutes,

1537
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:51,034
we can rule Kern County!

1538
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:52,801
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1539
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:53,836
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1540
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,404
Yeah!

1541
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:57,573
Gentlemen, now!

1542
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,808
Now! Now!

1543
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:01,110
Now!

1544
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:05,048
Now we play some football!

1545
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:23,199
That ought to keep them going

1546
01:23:23,299 --> 01:23:27,570
through the kickoff.

1547
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:31,574
They say a little bit of this stuff
warms the body and clouds the mind.

1548
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:36,579
Oh, that stuff runs right through you.

1549
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,082
Better go drain the weasel.

1550
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:41,084
Come on, Ren, have a drink.

1551
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,086
We're going down on a sinking ship here,

1552
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:46,422
and the only way to do that
with dignity is to be drunk.

1553
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,257
It's easy for you, isn't it?

1554
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,259
What the hell, you stunk thirteen years ago,

1555
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:53,562
and you stink tonight,
haven't lost a goddamn thing.

1556
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:57,200
No, this frigging nightmare is all mine now.

1557
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,536
And it's all my fault. So, have a drink.

1558
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:02,371
It's not your fault, Jack.

1559
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,673
Oh, yes, it is.

1560
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,576
Just have a goddamn drink and relax!

1561
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,198
You.

1562
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:31,134
Oh, my God!

1563
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:32,368
That was you.

1564
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:34,737
I forgot it was in there--
I mean, who put that in there?

1565
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,272
- You son of a bitch.
- You don't think I--

1566
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:38,141
I ought to kill you!

1567
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:41,644
- Reno, Reno, I was framed.
- Framed, my ass!

1568
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:48,217
Goddamn it!

1569
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:50,052
You started this rotten disaster,

1570
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:52,020
and you're going to finish it.

1571
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:53,722
You quarterback in the second half,

1572
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:56,058
and they'll kill you.

1573
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:59,328
You know what they're gonna
put on your tombstone? Huh?

1574
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,697
Jack Dundee, he tried to remake history

1575
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:04,700
and he got beat 100 to absolute nothing!

1576
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,335
I don't think they'll score that many points.

1577
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,672
They might score 200, but what fool cares?

1578
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,512
There you go.

1579
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,582
What do you got to say now, Jack-o?

1580
01:25:21,217 --> 01:25:23,352
You're right.

1581
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,788
You're not a quarterback anymore, Reno.

1582
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,257
You're just a van specialist.

1583
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:30,393
And I never should have
expected a van specialist

1584
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:33,529
to lift a town out of lethargy.

1585
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:37,200
I was wrong to think
that you were still a leader,

1586
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:38,601
because you've lost it, Reno,

1587
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,537
not just in football, but in life.

1588
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:44,640
There, I've said it. I'm sorry.

1589
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,675
Now I'm ready to die.

1590
01:25:49,745 --> 01:25:52,315
Uh, two minutes left to kickoff.

1591
01:25:52,415 --> 01:25:54,683
Time for my last smoke.

1592
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:57,853
You lazy jive ass!

1593
01:25:57,953 --> 01:25:59,488
You're soft, you're slow,

1594
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:01,790
and your hands are for shit.

1595
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,792
Hey, who woke you up?

1596
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:07,363
Get on the field and shut up, Luther.

1597
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:11,567
Reno, you're a prick.
And you always were a prick.

1598
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,336
Great, great.

1599
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:17,005
Now get your ass on the field.

1600
01:26:17,273 --> 01:26:18,707
Now.

1601
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,159
When he was a prick,

1602
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,094
Reno Hightower was the greatest quarterback

1603
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:42,531
in the history of south Kern County.

1604
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,733
One more thing, Jack.

1605
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,670
You ain't playing in the
second half. You're through.

1606
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,742
Damn you.

1607
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:55,278
Reno!

1608
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,870
Whoa, Nellie! He's wearing his white shoes.

1609
01:27:23,306 --> 01:27:24,307


1610
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:27,910
Oh, my God!

1611
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,350
Reno! Reno! Reno!

1612
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:40,556
Unbelievable!

1613
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:43,326
Reno! Reno! Reno!

1614
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:45,694
The crowd's going wild.

1615
01:27:52,968 --> 01:27:54,537


1616
01:28:04,347 --> 01:28:06,949
- Let's go!
- Get them, Reno!

1617
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,052
I'd like your attention on the sidelines,

1618
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:12,220
the late arrival is Jack Dundee.

1619
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,222
Right there. Ready?

1620
01:28:14,423 --> 01:28:15,524
Come on, grandma. Hit!

1621
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,825
Hut!

1622
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,802
First down, Taft.

1623
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,671
- Set!
- Yeah, I'm gonna kick your butt.

1624
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,473
- Whose butt?
- Hut!

1625
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:32,475
Hut!

1626
01:28:32,575 --> 01:28:33,542
Hut!

1627
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:39,482
Complete to Luther Jackson
at the Bakersfield 34.

1628
01:28:39,582 --> 01:28:41,884
- What the hell's happening here?
- First down pass.

1629
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,952
Come on, let's get something moving.

1630
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,622
They're scared, they're scared.
That's a great catch!

1631
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:48,591
Great catch, my ass, that's
what you're supposed to do

1632
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:49,925
when the ball hits you in the hands.

1633
01:28:50,025 --> 01:28:51,627
And I want some protection from you lazy bastards.

1634
01:28:51,727 --> 01:28:53,529
I'm tired of picking myself up from the ground.

1635
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:55,864
Play-action pass to Luther on two. Ready, break.

1636
01:28:58,133 --> 01:28:59,835
- Ready?
- You're going to die, boy.

1637
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,504
- Bring it on, chump!
- Set!

1638
01:29:01,604 --> 01:29:02,538
Now, let's go!

1639
01:29:02,638 --> 01:29:03,506
Your mama!

1640
01:29:03,606 --> 01:29:04,573
Hut!

1641
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:09,912
Come on, kill him!

1642
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,783
He's at the 25,

1643
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:19,688
- the 20, the 15, the 10, the five.
- Get that chump, man.

1644
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:21,424
Touchdown!

1645
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:33,769
Taft 7, Bakersfield 26.

1646
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,776
Get him! Get him!

1647
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:47,450
Stop him!

1648
01:29:50,753 --> 01:29:51,787
Touchdown!

1649
01:29:56,459 --> 01:29:58,827
You wipe that stupid grin off your face.

1650
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:04,667
Yes!

1651
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:07,836
Third quarter, Taft 14, Bakersfield 26.

1652
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:10,573
I got hot nuts!

1653
01:30:10,673 --> 01:30:12,407
I got hot nuts!

1654
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:15,678
You ain't had hot nuts in 50 years!

1655
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:17,012
Hut!

1656
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:22,851
Hold them where they are!

1657
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:23,919
Hut!

1658
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:26,955
Hut!

1659
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:35,464
What's happening?

1660
01:30:35,564 --> 01:30:36,899
7:36 left to play.

1661
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,845
Get him!

1662
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:59,121
Bakersfield's going to get clobbered.

1663
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,256
Taft 21, Bakersfield 26.

1664
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,627
- Hut!
- Go, Tigers!

1665
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:05,661
Hut!

1666
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:10,165
Come on!

1667
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:14,870
Go!

1668
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:36,725
How much time we got?

1669
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,627
Play ball.

1670
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:41,597
I'm going to remember you, too.

1671
01:31:41,697 --> 01:31:44,066
Great second half, Ren.

1672
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:49,037
Good thing I'm not in there, huh?

1673
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:50,238
Did you think in my whole life

1674
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:53,475
I'd never find out who trashed Gigi?

1675
01:31:53,576 --> 01:31:55,210
Only a fool would bring that tiger's head

1676
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:57,846
in the locker room.

1677
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:00,482
Well, I'm a genius at making a fool out of myself.

1678
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,417
Always finding new ways to do it.

1679
01:32:02,585 --> 01:32:04,920
Well, I got one more for you, Jack.

1680
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:10,158
We get the ball back, you're in there.

1681
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:12,595
Why me?

1682
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:15,898
Let's go, Tigers!

1683
01:32:15,998 --> 01:32:18,266
First and 10 at the Taft 42.

1684
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,604
One minute left in the game. Clock running.

1685
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:24,306
Just hold on to the frigging ball, will you?

1686
01:32:24,406 --> 01:32:26,208
At the line, the ball comes loose!

1687
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:27,643
It's a fumble!

1688
01:32:30,613 --> 01:32:31,780
Who's got the ball?

1689
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:38,453
Come on!

1690
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:41,056
The referees are trying to unpile it.

1691
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:42,490
Who's recovered the fumble?

1692
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:44,092
Back off!

1693
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:45,961
It's our ball, it's our ball.

1694
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,262
We got the ball!

1695
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,632
Get your balls out of my face.

1696
01:32:49,732 --> 01:32:51,233
- Hey, who has it?
- Taft has the ball!

1697
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:54,970
Taft recovered the ball
at their own five-yard line!

1698
01:32:58,306 --> 01:32:59,908
What a lucky bastard!

1699
01:33:02,945 --> 01:33:04,647
Let's go, Jack.

1700
01:33:04,713 --> 01:33:06,248
- Where?
- All right, let's go!

1701
01:33:06,348 --> 01:33:08,116
Go get them, baby.
You got it. Go get them.

1702
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,088
Oh, shit.

1703
01:33:13,188 --> 01:33:16,391
Number 99, Jack Dundee, is going in for Taft.

1704
01:33:16,659 --> 01:33:18,026


1705
01:33:20,663 --> 01:33:22,564
Post out on two, get out of bounds.

1706
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:26,034
Anybody screws up, I'll kill you.

1707
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,269
Relax.

1708
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:28,570
Relax.

1709
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,572
Reno up to the line. Eddie, fullback.

1710
01:33:30,673 --> 01:33:32,675
Dundee flanked wide to the left.

1711
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:35,310
Hey, Jack, they finally let you back in the game?

1712
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:37,813
They got to be kidding.

1713
01:33:37,913 --> 01:33:40,348
Where are your glasses,
you Casper the friendly ghost?

1714
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,017
You see that? Can you see?

1715
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,986
Oh, yeah, I can see you, Dr. Death.

1716
01:33:44,086 --> 01:33:45,553
You better watch out, Dr. Death.

1717
01:33:45,688 --> 01:33:47,956
I'm pretty damn fast for a Caucasian.

1718
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:49,024
Hut!

1719
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,363
- Take that!
- Oh, my God!

1720
01:33:58,033 --> 01:34:00,168
And he's out of bounds at the 30!

1721
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,773
Forty-nine seconds left.

1722
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:06,241
Line up, line up!

1723
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,877
Ain't you passed, Jack?
I thought I broke your back last time.

1724
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,779
Want some more medicine, Dr. Death?

1725
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:12,014
Hut!

1726
01:34:14,917 --> 01:34:16,384
You ready for that?

1727
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,987
Pass complete to Powers.

1728
01:34:19,087 --> 01:34:21,824
He's out of bounds at the 45.

1729
01:34:21,924 --> 01:34:23,291
Reno, Reno!

1730
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:24,927
The clock stops. Thirty-seven seconds left.

1731
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:25,928
Go!

1732
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:27,095
Let's go!

1733
01:34:28,764 --> 01:34:29,564
Ready?

1734
01:34:29,765 --> 01:34:30,966
It's me and you, Jack.

1735
01:34:31,066 --> 01:34:32,100
Hut!

1736
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,236
Jack in the mud!

1737
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:39,975
Next!

1738
01:34:40,075 --> 01:34:43,245
Carlos down to the 50.
The clock's still running.

1739
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:44,980
Taft has one time-out left.

1740
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,315
Hurry up, offense.

1741
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:49,284
Let's go, let's go!

1742
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,753
Reno! Reno!

1743
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:52,921
Reno! Reno!

1744
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,356
Hut!

1745
01:35:03,766 --> 01:35:05,868
Reno Hightower sacked for a big loss.

1746
01:35:05,968 --> 01:35:07,535
Time-out! Time!

1747
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:08,670
Time, time!

1748
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,272
Time-out, Taft.

1749
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,410
- We're secure.
- Come on, Ren.

1750
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,813
We got time for one more.

1751
01:35:17,913 --> 01:35:19,447
Ren, I can get open.

1752
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,016
Come on. He can't get open.

1753
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:23,986
I can get open.

1754
01:35:24,086 --> 01:35:26,789
Come here, Jack.

1755
01:35:35,497 --> 01:35:38,901
Half these people came here tonight,
Jack, to watch you catch the ball.

1756
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,270
The other half came to see you drop it.

1757
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:44,272
I was going to throw it to you,

1758
01:35:44,372 --> 01:35:46,108
just to show you up, but I want to win.

1759
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:47,943
I'm calling somebody else's number.

1760
01:35:48,043 --> 01:35:51,446
I can get open.

1761
01:35:51,546 --> 01:35:54,649
You drop that damn thing again,
Jack, your life is over.

1762
01:35:54,817 --> 01:35:57,052
Just throw me the goddamn ball, Reno.

1763
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:04,827
Can you get open?

1764
01:36:13,235 --> 01:36:15,137
We are Taft!

1765
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:17,139
We are Taft!

1766
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:20,375
We are Taft!

1767
01:36:20,475 --> 01:36:22,878
- All right, Olin, this stick is you.
- Right.

1768
01:36:22,978 --> 01:36:25,480
Eddie, you're the bottle cap.

1769
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,582
Take care of that maniac and
come in from the right side.

1770
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:28,683
- Yeah.
- And Chico?

1771
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:30,418
- Uh-huh?
- Block and flare.

1772
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:33,021
Carlos, head straight for the water bucket

1773
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,723
and cut toward that corner of the gym.

1774
01:36:35,858 --> 01:36:40,595
- Jack, give them your best move.
- My best move.

1775
01:36:40,863 --> 01:36:42,264
- You ready?
- Ready.

1776
01:36:42,364 --> 01:36:44,432
- On two. Ready?
- Break!

1777
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,068
We are Taft!

1778
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:48,370
We are Taft!

1779
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,305
Yay!

1780
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:52,074
Yay!

1781
01:36:52,174 --> 01:36:54,309
Come on, you're not going
to give it to Jack, are you?

1782
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:55,944
You think I'm crazy?

1783
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:57,112
Go!

1784
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:03,585
Whoo! Win it, guys!

1785
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:10,993
At their own 45. No time-outs left.

1786
01:37:11,093 --> 01:37:14,496
Five seconds left on the clock.

1787
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:16,999
This is it, Jack.

1788
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:20,402
Throw it to Jack!

1789
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,004
Will be the last play of the game.

1790
01:37:22,104 --> 01:37:23,071
Ready!

1791
01:37:24,106 --> 01:37:26,741
Death, humiliation, and pain.

1792
01:37:26,909 --> 01:37:28,343
You ready for this, Dundee?

1793
01:37:28,443 --> 01:37:30,412
Come and get me, sucker.

1794
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:31,446
Set!

1795
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:52,935


1796
01:38:52,127 --> 01:38:54,429
Touchdown!

1797
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,407
How are your legs?

1798
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:42,744
My knees are killing me.

1799
01:39:43,045 --> 01:39:45,080
They feel great.

1800
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:48,550
God, I love to watch you play.

1801
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,634
I did it.

1802
01:40:06,734 --> 01:40:09,871
Nice catch.

1803
01:40:10,072 --> 01:40:11,773
I was so lucky.

1804
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:12,774
No.

1805
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:16,178
No, you were due.

1806
01:40:16,278 --> 01:40:17,379
Hey, Jack!

1807
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:21,649
I challenge you to a rematch
next year on astro turf.

1808
01:40:21,749 --> 01:40:23,185
Hey, look out! Watch it!

1809
01:40:25,153 --> 01:40:26,588
Damn it.

1810
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:29,724
Let's go home.

1811
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,830
How the hell did that clown ever catch the ball?

1812
01:40:36,064 --> 01:40:38,066
Clown?

1813
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,635
Did you see that great move?

1814
01:40:40,735 --> 01:40:43,771
It was my son-in-law.

1815
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,040
Hey, 99.

1816
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:49,177
Nice catch.
