1
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,840
I had once the beautiful fatherland.

2
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,840
The oak tree grew so high there.

3
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,680
Violets nodded softly.

4
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
It was a dream.

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,720
It kissed me in German
and spoke in German.

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,120
You would hardly believe
how good it sounded,

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,200
the words, ich liebe dich,
I love you.

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,920
It was a dream.

9
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Adam.

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,600
Adam, it's time.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,400
Oh, my landlady Ruth Edelson.

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,720
Let me ask you something.

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Am I still handsome this morning?

14
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Tell the truth now, come on.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,280
Of course you are, Adam.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
I don't think there's any time
for the-

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,880
for the breakfast.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,920
You know, I have never asked you,
my darling,

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,520
how old are you?

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,120
Forgive me, you are the witch.

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,200
You are the hexer.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
You have swindled time.

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,400
Adam, please.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
After you fell asleep last night, darling,

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,160
I lay there.

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,240
I was thinking,

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,480
"My God, this woman's skin
is unnaturally smooth."

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,880
It is like porcelain.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,040
In fact, I can see my reflection in it.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Now, what are you hiding under there?

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Darling, show me.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
- Show me, show me.
- Adam.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,720
Come here, just a little peek.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,200
A bruise?

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,680
I'm sorry, Adam, believe me.

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,000
Forgive me, Adam.

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
Morning, Adam.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,840
All set to go.

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah, do not forget this Olivetti please.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
We won't, pal, come on.

41
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,760
Forgive me, Adam.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,560
I shouldn't have called them.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,200
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,280
It's all right, Ruth.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
Oh, you taste like...

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,320
soap.

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,640
So why'd you do it, Adam?

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,040
Do it?

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,440
What is it you think that I did?

50
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,520
You know, that old magic trick

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,040
where you separate a woman's spinal column
from her skull.

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
Choking his landlady.

53
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,920
Oh, this is- that's ridiculous.

54
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,840
Nah, he didn't mean to hurt her.

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,000
Just wanted us to bring him home again.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,080
Right, Adam?

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,920
Yeah, woof, woof.

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,080
And so I was once again returned

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,720
to my home in the desert,

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,720
The Seizling Institute,

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
founded by American philanthropist
Rebecca Seizling

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,960
as a center under the direction
of Dr. Nathan Gross

63
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,440
for innovative therapy

64
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,680
and as a home for the survivors
of the Nazi camps.

65
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
Muhammad.

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,960
Do you see that?

67
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
Come on.

68
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,040
Big guy's waiting.

69
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
Adam.

70
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,440
Oh, that's a big hug.

71
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,520
He's back.

72
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,040
I am so happy to see you too.

73
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
Yes, still sweeping.

74
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,680
Am I tracking-
I don't want to track sand on your-

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,760
on your floor.

76
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,360
And heil to Rebecca.

77
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,720
All my best friends.

78
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,880
What's this?

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Oh, transport.

80
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,720
Have they all gone insane?
Well...

81
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Two hundred bucks.

82
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,800
Adam, been hiding them for months.

83
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
You've got to tell me what to do.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
AT&T, Mr. Blum,
New York Stock Exchange.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,960
Here, give it to me.

86
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,040
I will double it for you in-
in no time.

87
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,200
- Adam.
- Yeah?

88
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Columbus was Jew?

89
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,960
Yes, yes, Mrs. Lipowitz.

90
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,480
Columbus was definitely a Jew

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,320
but also an Italian,
so as a matter of fact,

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,040
I would not trust an Italian,
and neither should you.

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
Yeah, it's true,
they're an enlightened bunch.

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,480
But they licked the jackboot,

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,440
and now they expect everyone
to forgive and forget.

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,840
- My train.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,880
You.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Really, Arthur, you know that
Mrs. Seizling strictly forbade

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,640
any form of locomotive combustion
at the Institute.

100
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
My train.

101
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Arthur-

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,960
You know what I'm talking about.

103
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,280
Fellow survivors, it's so good

104
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
to be back here at the Institute,

105
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,240
though not as inmate,
not as guinea pig.

106
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,800
No, this time,
I am on the mission

107
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
to expose the lunacy

108
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,640
of the medical staff here
at the Seizling Institute,

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,600
the negligence, Dr. Shapiro,

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,640
and the impotence

111
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,240
of Herr Professor Nathan Gross, et al.

112
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,760
He's lying.

113
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,040
Authorized by whom?

114
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,160
And here she comes.

115
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,280
I could hear her methodical footfalls

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,560
and irregular heartbeat.

117
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,760
Nurse Gina Grey,

118
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,560
a pearl in a dunghill,

119
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
a book of rules,

120
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,480
and with that classy ass.

121
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,440
Arthur, please stop that.

122
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,040
No.

123
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,080
No.

124
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Adam.

125
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,640
Would you come with me?

126
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,640
Dr. Gross wants to say hello.

127
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
No. No.

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,280
Would you please swallow those pills,
Mr. Blum?

129
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
Hmm, not now.

130
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,800
You've lost some weight, Adam.

131
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,720
Oh, yeah, I was- I was pining for you,
my child.

132
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,360
The nights have been the worst,
you know.

133
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,400
Hmm.

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,280
I've heard about your nights.

135
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,360
But I'm sure you didn't mean
to hurt your landlady.

136
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,400
Come in, Adam.

137
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,680
Oh, come here, Gina.

138
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Let me smell something.

139
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,200
Oh, yeah, just like I remember.

140
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Touch me.

141
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,840
Touch me.

142
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Come in already.

143
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,800
Yes, you love doing that,
don't you, Adam?

144
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,200
Uh, oh, yeah, the-
the sharp transition.

145
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Here one moment...

146
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,600
You know, Adam-

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
Gone the next.

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,480
What I can't figure out,

149
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
why haven't we been able to help you?

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,760
You're a brilliant man.

151
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,920
You've been called a genius.

152
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,920
Name: Adam Stein,
next of kin: none whatsoever,

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,000
number on my arm:

154
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
sieben, sechs, drei, vier, fuenf.

155
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,080
Gross, file it away and let me go.

156
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,880
And yet, you see,
for all your knowledge,

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,440
your sixth, seventh sense,
here you are

158
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,240
back at the Institute
after trying to kill a woman

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
less than 24 hours ago.

160
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,960
This is a lie.

161
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
No, this is a lie.

162
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
- Yes.
- No, that's a lie.

163
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
A woman named Ruth Edelson.

164
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,520
And you, Gross, you are-
you're a joke.

165
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Ah, do you want to tell me why?

166
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,280
Yeah, back there,
it was absurd to believe...

167
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,360
in anything.

168
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,400
In the sun we did not believe.

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,720
And yet you, here of all places,
you believe in miracles.

170
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,960
You not only believe in them;
you depend on them.

171
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,680
This is not only hilarious;
this is chutzpah.

172
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,240
- Adam.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
There's only one person in this institute

174
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,560
who can work miracles.

175
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,360
They're circus tricks.

176
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,600
I could teach them to you in a day.

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,680
Listen, Grossie.

178
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
See, I've been the- the star of your-

179
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,680
your medical experiments,

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
and you have failed miserably.

181
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,440
So don't you dare talk to me
about some miracles.

182
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,520
Now, of course, my job is to fail.

183
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I am the sick dying clown.

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,680
Fine, this is my business.

185
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
But what have you done to help me,

186
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,080
to help any of us?

187
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,240
No, you're right.

188
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,320
And I'm sorry
from the bottom of my heart.

189
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
As long as you know.

190
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,720
Now let's just see what's going on

191
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,720
with your lovely personal affairs.

192
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,800
Oh, now, wait a minute.

193
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,840
Please.

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,160
Adam, stop.

195
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,600
It has not been your day,
has it, Doctor?

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,000
Some milk of magnesia.

197
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,400
That would solve the problem.

198
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,600
Constipation, it's a horrible thing,
but don't strain.

199
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,640
Cut it out.

200
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,000
You don't have to suffer that way.

201
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,520
If only you'd use your gift
a little more constructively.

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,040
Oh, I could if I wanted to.

203
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,120
But, you know, I- I do not.

204
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,400
No, I am going to be your miracle
that never was.

205
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,880
And we've heard all this before, Adam.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
Go on and get some rest.

207
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,600
Go, already.
Get out of here.

208
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,600
Where the hell is all this coming from?

209
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,520
And no pulse.

210
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,760
Maybe in a hundred years,

211
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,920
we'll know how to help
the Adam Steins of this world.

212
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,000
Adam.

213
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,280
- Step back, Rachel.
- Adam.

214
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Get away from him.

215
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,520
Rachel.

216
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,600
- Is it time, Adam?
- Step away from him.

217
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,760
Rachel.

218
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,640
Oh, thank God.

219
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,040
The birth pang of the Messiah.

220
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I knew it.

221
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,720
They've begun.

222
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,320
Oy vey.

223
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,200
It's good to have you back, Adam.

224
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,400
Frau Fogel, the whisky
in the baby bottle, please.

225
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,480
My wife, Gretchen.

226
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,520
Little Ruthie.

227
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you, Frau Fogel.

228
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,720
Ah, malt whisky.

229
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,840
It's for the good night's sleep, yeah?

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,840
All right, please.

231
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh.

232
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
Gretchen.

233
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,760
So sweet.

234
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,840
Blech.

235
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,920
Ah, she doesn't like it.

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,960
She doesn't like it.

237
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,760
The most expensive Stradivarius.

238
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,800
Here we go.

239
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

240
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,320
meine Damen und Herren

241
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,680
Adam Stein.

242
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,960
My wife, Gretchen.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
Oh, so beautiful.

244
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,160
Oh, no, no, you cannot keep survival
off the stage.

245
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Don't scare me like this.

246
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
My darling.

247
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,520
A volunteer.

248
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,760
Oh-ma-ha.

249
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,200
Yeah-ha.

250
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Everybody loves this.

251
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,800
No, you volunteer too often.

252
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,280
This fellow, please, may we?

253
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,320
Bitte nicht.

254
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Please, my eye fell on you
right away, please.

255
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,080
Such a good sport, give him a hand.

256
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
He's shy.

257
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
All right, now, have we ever met?

258
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Do we know each other?

259
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
- Nein.
- Nein.

260
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,080
All right.

261
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,160
This young man,
ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,200
well, did not want to come
to Adam's circus tonight.

263
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,440
This man had other plans.

264
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,360
This very night he intended...

265
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,640
to take his own life.

266
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,400
No, my friend, no.

267
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,960
Please, do not go this way.

268
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,320
Let me just glean just a little.

269
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,680
Maybe there's some good news here.

270
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
Let me see.

271
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,200
We have here, folks,
a graduate of Heidelberg Universitaet.

272
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Oh, though, obviously no-
no star pupil.

273
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,080
This is Zyklot 17,
the animal tranquilizer.

274
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, for the permanent relief of pain.

275
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,640
Yeah.

276
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
Oh.

277
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,480
Oh.

278
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,960
Tell her to leave me alone.

279
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,440
I do not have the strength.

280
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,040
Do you hear what I'm asking you?

281
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I would if I wanted to.

282
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,000
But I don't.

283
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,400
What the hell are you doing?

284
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,560
Shut up, darling, and move over.

285
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,200
You are insane.

286
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,960
I am calling the night nurse.

287
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,720
Right here at your service? Adam?

288
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,680
we bring now to the stage my daughter,

290
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,040
the amazing, the brain-bending,
Miss Ruthie.

291
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,840
Isn't she so amazing?

293
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,880
You are my angel.

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,440
Do not be frightened.

295
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,280
You cannot see anything,
can you, Ruthie?

296
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,320
- No.
- No.

297
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,280
She says no.

298
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,960
She's looking askance at me,
my- my darling wife.

299
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,520
Oh, I love to get a smile
out of my wife.

300
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,280
Give her a big hand.

301
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
What's down there?

302
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,680
Ah, I love that.

303
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,280
Ow.

304
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
My wife, Gretchen.

305
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,720
I pick up the first blade,
so absolute silence.

306
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,760
Here we are.

307
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,240
Ruthie, don't.

308
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,520
She will do anything to avoid this part.

309
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,280
You don't like this part,
but no brain bending.

310
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,360
That is-

311
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,320
When you pulled up the thing
and you winked at the audience

312
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,320
and they went crazy,
you were killing me.

313
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,360
That stays in the show.

314
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
Papa.

315
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,720
You are a little genius, I think.

316
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,760
Papa, there's a man.

317
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,760
Was that spontaneous,
or did you work it out before?

318
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,800
Tell me.

319
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,840
- That's your bit.
- Adam, it's him.

320
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,040
Volk.

321
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,680
Well, Herr Stein.

322
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,040
All performers must be members
of the Reichstheaterkammer.

323
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,320
You do not qualify.

324
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,000
No sense of humor at all.

325
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
Tell me this.

326
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Did your men like that bit with the bear?

327
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,800
Erschiessen.

328
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,840
You were warned, Adam.

329
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
I am not political.

330
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,320
Everyone loves the circus.

331
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,160
Well, I have to admit,

332
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,240
things have been less interesting around here.

333
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,760
It seems incredible.

334
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
A man who only yesterday spewed out

335
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,960
streams of blood from his toe.

336
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,000
Not to mention the pancreatic tumor
he sprouted in March.

337
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,400
And the heart attack last summer.

338
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,840
The man has actually spat out
part of a lung.

339
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,040
I mean, it's an amazing thing,
the self-destruction.

340
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,920
The amazing thing about Adam Stein

341
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,400
isn't his control over his body.

342
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,800
It's his power over you, Nathan.

343
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,240
What?

344
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,520
And a few other staff members
I could name.

345
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,560
Relax, Uri.

346
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Eat your foie gras.

347
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,240
- Adam.
- Look who's here.

348
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,280
And, Wolfowitz, now look,

349
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,520
mein Gott im Himmel,
you look just awful.

350
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,840
It's just not- not good.

351
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
Ah, Rachel, oh, you pumpkin.

352
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,360
Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

353
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,800
And Zelda, dear, yeah,
you keep the sky from falling,

354
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
but- but sit.

355
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,640
Adam, Schwester's been dreaming again

356
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,920
with her nonsense.

357
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,680
She says it's soon, very soon.

358
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,120
And she is right, Wolfowitz.

359
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,480
Yes, beautiful, what is it?

360
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,520
Tell me.

361
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,440
He came again last night.

362
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,480
- Shh.
- It's a secret?

363
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,080
The Archangel.

364
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,880
He lay beside me and said,

365
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,240
"This time Adam has returned
to lead the sufferers,

366
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,640
"the bearers of the blue numbers,
to the desert.

367
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,360
The gates of heaven will open and-"

368
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,000
No, of course- of course I will, Rachel.

369
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,840
That day is near, but not yet, dear.

370
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
Not- not before lunch.

371
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,200
I will usher and proclaim and rescue.

372
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,120
Me, the clown?

373
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,680
You see that?

374
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,640
You know he takes money from the patients?

375
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,920
Invests it in the stock market.

376
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,520
Gross.

377
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,600
You?

378
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,600
For the Institute, Slonim.

379
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,960
I mean, whatever else he is,

380
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,480
he's a very astute financial advisor.

381
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,640
You're worse than Rachel Schwester over there.

382
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,280
She thinks he'll lead them all to salvation.

383
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Adam, I need to talk to you.

384
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,240
No, later, later.

385
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,160
What is it?

386
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,240
What is it, Adam?

387
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,280
Hoof beats?

388
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,360
Gross.

389
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,080
Who let a dog in here?

390
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,880
Nathan, who let a dog in here?

391
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,360
What are you talking about?

392
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,120
There's no dog here.

393
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,760
When I first came here,

394
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,480
they promised me that there would never,
ever be any dogs.

395
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,800
How could you?

396
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,760
Calm down.

397
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,800
Edward, how are you today?

398
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,160
My God.

399
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,400
Adam.

400
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,160
Adam.

401
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,560
All right.

402
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,040
Come on, Adam, come on.

403
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay.

404
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,840
Yeah, good.

405
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
Good.

406
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,560
Yeah.

407
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,040
Papa.

408
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,680
You are my angel, Ruthie.

409
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
Do not be frightened.

410
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,880
You.

411
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Well, Adam Stein.

412
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,720
The funniest man in Germany,

413
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,280
delivered to Stellring,
of all places.

414
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,640
Come here, Adam.

415
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,040
I am Commandant Klein.

416
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,680
I can't tell you how happy I am
to see you here.

417
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,920
You should have seen him
at the circus in Berlin.

418
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,680
Any kind of animal, he could do it.

419
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,080
Such a clown.

420
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,680
Go on, Adam.

421
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
Do a trick.

422
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,680
Make us laugh.

423
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,280
Mama, Mama.

424
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Ruthie?

425
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,440
Where are you taking me?

426
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,760
No, no, no.

427
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,640
Now- now do a dog for Rex here.

428
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,840
You've made a friend, Adam.

429
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,160
The smell of a Jew
usually sends Rex into a frenzy.

430
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,000
Sergeant, take Herr Stein to Rex's pen.

431
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,280
No, Adam...

432
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,960
on all fours.

433
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,640
It's funnier that way.

434
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,400
Go on, Adam...

435
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,080
or Rex will get all the meat.

436
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,960
I followed your career, Adam.

437
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,440
You studied philosophy at Heidelberg,
didn't you?

438
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Funny we never met there.

439
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,200
Herr Kommandant, please.

440
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm a keen observer,

441
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,040
a student of the Semitic phenomenon.

442
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Of course, you're not an average specimen,

443
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,360
Germany's most celebrated clown.

444
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,680
You're a superman, Adam,
practically Aryan.

445
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,040
So maybe we can help each other.

446
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,120
Head down.

447
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,720
Don't look at me.

448
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,200
A life for a life.

449
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,280
Mine for yours.

450
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,760
You stay here with me,
make me laugh,

451
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,720
keep my mind off the business outside.

452
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,400
Believe me, it's a thankless job.

453
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,160
My wife and daughters.

454
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,440
What's that?

455
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,640
Speak up, Adam.

456
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
My wife and daughters.

457
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,160
Bargaining already, Adam.

458
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,760
The Semitic phenomenon in action,

459
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,360
right here at my feet.

460
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,880
Unfortunately,
I am only Untersturmfuehrer.

461
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
I don't make the rules.

462
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,280
But we'll see.

463
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,440
Yes, we have plenty of time.

464
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,000
Rex.

465
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,120
Go on, Adam.

466
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
Wonderful, Adam.

467
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,760
Now, eat.

468
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,320
Eat.

469
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,360
Schmackhaft.

470
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,320
Nothing with claws or paws.

471
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
Seizling gave me her word.

472
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,200
Room 285 is in the observation ward.

473
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
It's off-limits.

474
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,800
Now, Gina tells me

475
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,400
that you slept on the floor again
last night.

476
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,760
Oh, is this how you're going
to break me, Gross,

477
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
with a dog?

478
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Well, nice try.

479
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,760
But look at me.

480
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,400
See?
I'm smiling.

481
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,720
No, actually, Adam, you're crying.

482
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,560
It is-
Yeah, you momzer- water.

483
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
I had a- I had a drink of water
on the way.

484
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,960
Through your eyes?

485
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,120
Come on, Adam,
you can do better than that.

486
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,080
Okay, I am ready for you,
Frankenstein.

487
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,400
If experiments are your game,
then let's play.

488
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,440
Give me your best shot.

489
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,080
But before you cure me,

490
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,400
you will all go crazy yourselves.

491
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,680
The door to 285 is locked.

492
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm glad to see you feeling better, Adam,

493
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
but we're a little busy at the moment.

494
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,400
Not now.

495
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,040
You and I, my darling,
we're going to cry together,

496
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,480
and I'm going to drink your tears.

497
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,080
Yes, I love very deeply.

498
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,000
It is the romance supreme.

499
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,760
Do you understand, my- my dar-

500
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,520
There are rules, Adam.

501
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
Compassion.

502
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,040
Mercy.

503
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,120
You're the nurse.

504
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,160
What- what happened to-

505
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,760
You break the tiniest rule,
you break the entire system.

506
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,040
Do you know who is also
a great believer in the rules?

507
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,320
Hmm?

508
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,920
Kommandant Klein.

509
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Ow.

510
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,880
What a terrible thing to say.

511
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,960
Yeah, well, I only insult people I love.

512
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,040
You don't love me.

513
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,000
You treat me like a dog.

514
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah, exactly.

515
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
Oh, but you're so wrong.

516
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,080
With you, I lose control.

517
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,640
When I was strangling the landlady,

518
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,600
who do you think
I was really strangling, Gina?

519
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,640
You.

520
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
You bastard.

521
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,000
Do it.

522
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,440
Do it like I taught you, sweetheart.

523
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,800
No, they'll hear me.

524
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,760
Do it.

525
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,760
Yeah, down on your knees and crawl.

526
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,840
That is correct.

527
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,240
Yeah, but that sounds like a schnauzer.

528
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
I want the wolfhound.

529
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
Oh, I like it.

530
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh, that's right.

531
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh, that's right.

532
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,640
You're despicable, darling.

533
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,480
Just give it back when you're done.

534
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,440
Let me see what kind of beast
has Gross brought here.

535
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,320
Let me see what you are.

536
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,360
Come here.

537
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,880
Ow!

538
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
You know you can't be in here, Adam.

539
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,000
Come on.

540
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,080
Come on, let's go.

541
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,120
Bad dog.

542
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,200
Bad dog.

543
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,560
Bad dog.

544
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,480
Okay, let me see your hand.

545
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,800
I told it I'd be back,
and it understood.

546
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,000
Get back in there.

547
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,280
The stench.

548
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,520
Lying in his own goddamn feces.

549
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,320
But the attendant,
that flea-bitten gibbon,

550
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,040
he did not.

551
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
Adam, stop.

552
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,280
Stop it now.

553
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,680
Son of a bitch.

554
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,360
Crazy son of a bitch.

555
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,520
Before Hitler, we were hated
by the rest of Europe,

556
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,920
loved only by our Jews,

557
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,680
who somehow convinced themselves

558
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,400
that our two nations shared a common destiny.

559
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,160
A pair of pariahs,

560
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,520
so said your man Kafka,
that demented Hebrew.

561
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,520
Sprung from the same bosom.

562
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,200
No wonder it's such messy business

563
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,560
vomiting you from our midst.

564
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
Adam!

565
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,840
Down, boy!

566
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,680
Without rules, there is chaos.

567
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,880
I know you can appreciate this.

568
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,640
Even in a circus, there are rules.

569
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
Herr Kommandant.

570
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,880
Those trucks outside, the Red Cross.

571
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,120
Shh.

572
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,440
You don't hear Rex begging for favors, do you?

573
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,000
They are taking prisoners to Matsdorflager.

574
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,720
Ask them to take three more.

575
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,480
Rex knows his role:
to serve and protect.

576
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,360
You know yours:
to comfort and entertain.

577
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
And who knows?

578
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Maybe that in itself
can save a life, yes?

579
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,880
Yes.

580
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,720
Danke schoen.

581
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,240
Look, Adam.

582
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,760
Look what I found for you.

583
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,480
It once played in the Dresden Orchestra.

584
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,880
There's been some rethinking.

585
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,920
We have new work for you.

586
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,080
That's nice, Adam.

587
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,280
Adam Stein?

588
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,480
Frau Fogel.

589
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,640
Listen, Adam.

590
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,120
I have news.

591
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,200
Quiet over there.

592
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,640
Ruthie's alive, inside Germany,

593
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,440
someplace special.

594
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,440
Play it, Adam.

595
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,720
You're crying, Adam.

596
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,440
It is water.

597
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,440
I had some water before.

598
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,480
Did I kill him?

599
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Almost.

600
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,560
You've got to be more careful, Adam.

601
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,640
We still need you.

602
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Danke schoen.

603
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
Listen, Adam.

604
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,360
I've had it.

605
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,600
In a month's time on Purim's Eve in 1962,

606
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,320
Abe Wolfowitz is going to be a dead man.

607
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,360
What?

608
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,560
I've been sewing my own shrouds
from bed sheets.

609
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,880
Don't tell Gina.

610
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,040
You are not going to leave me alone
in this madhouse, Abe.

611
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,240
Seriously, Adam.

612
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,400
Me and- and Him,

613
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,840
we're going to have it out
once and for all.

614
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,560
I want to know how-

615
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,240
how He could be so cruel.

616
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,800
And if He won't come to me,
I'll go to Him,

617
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,760
and you'll write my eulogy.

618
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,520
Okay, I- I'll write your eulogy.

619
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,240
Such a beautiful child,
my little Naomi.

620
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,320
Didn't look anything like me.

621
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,960
Got it all from her mother.

622
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,720
You write it down, Adam.

623
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,560
What do I write, Wolfie,
addressed to whom, God?

624
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,600
God is out to lunch.

625
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,680
He left a note, see, on your-
on your arm.

626
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
Don't say that name.

627
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,960
You are not going to kill yourself.

628
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,080
You remind me of Rabbi Lichtenstein,

629
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,720
who- who back in Stellring-
listen- would argue

630
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,080
that our debasement
was not God's doing but Satan's.

631
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,320
Listen.

632
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,200
But I would argue
that the crimes of Klein

633
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,280
are the crimes of Hitler,

634
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,720
but the crimes of Hitler
are the crimes of the Lord.

635
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
No, no, no, no, Adam.

636
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,120
You get some rest.

637
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,560
We can do this later.

638
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,360
But wait, wait, Wolfie.

639
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,520
The- the thing in 285 barks like a dog,

640
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,320
smells like a dog, but uh, the teeth?

641
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,600
Do I know, Adam?

642
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,400
It's- it's just some crazy kid
raised in a basement

643
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,000
with a chain around its neck.

644
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,960
A kid?

645
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,360
Gross says it's dangerous.

646
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,520
Nobody goes near it.

647
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,080
He's Gross' special project.

648
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,760
So you think-

649
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,200
you think that you are the only one?

650
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,880
Yeah?

651
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,960
Yeah.

652
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
Let me tell you,

653
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,120
oh, there are others.

654
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,920
Me, for instance.

655
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,360
Yeah.

656
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
Oh, yeah.

657
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I am the con man.

658
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,360
I am the freak.

659
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,200
I am the monstrosity.

660
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,360
I am the genius.

661
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,480
But true genius,
it comes with a price.

662
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,880
Yeah, the singer joins the opera.

663
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,480
The mathematician unlocks
the secrets of the universe.

664
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,760
But me?

665
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,480
Oh, my gifts, worthless.

666
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,640
And so I was marked for the circus.

667
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,160
I was destined for the sideshow.

668
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,560
And for the doghouse.

669
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,800
Yeah.

670
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,440
Oh, you didn't know this, did you?

671
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,920
Oh, yeah.

672
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,880
For one whole year,
I ate from the dog bowl,

673
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,120
lived on all fours,

674
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,080
slept in the pen,
shat on the ground.

675
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,640
I learned from the master.

676
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,680
Sturmfuehrer Rex.

677
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,240
But now do you see where my gifts
have delivered me?

678
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,520
Now, hang on, come here.

679
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,720
Wait, wait, come here.

680
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,800
Shh.

681
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,960
Hang on. Hang on.

682
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,840
Yeah, let me just see this.

683
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,600
The dog that is not the dog,
the child that is not the child.

684
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,720
This is the way they looked,
back there in the camps,

685
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,520
sunken cheeks, tubercular chests,

686
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,640
and from inside the blackened sockets,

687
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,560
those eyes sick with fear but alive.

688
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,600
Enough, Arthur.

689
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,120
Adam.

690
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,880
Shame on you.

691
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,840
This is a place for survivors, right?

692
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,920
Yes.

693
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,920
Well, what is this boy doing here?

694
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,960
Why- what are you doing
with this comb?

695
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,920
Gina, do not- don't make-
don't do it with the comb.

696
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,880
Well, Dr. Gross brought him.

697
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,960
Yes, Gross.

698
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,080
He was howling and biting himself,

699
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,560
sodden with his own filth.

700
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,280
We tried to get that awful chain off him,

701
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,760
but, you saw; it's still on.

702
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,440
No one has the right
to be more than me,

703
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,640
not you, not the dog.

704
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
- More what?
- Crazy.

705
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,880
He's crazier than me.

706
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You're not crazy.

707
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,080
I am crazy.

708
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,520
- You're sick.
- No, I am crazy.

709
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,560
You're sick.

710
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,040
That dog is superior to me,
do you understand this?

711
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,120
No?

712
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
He has succeeded where I have failed.

713
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,400
He is Gross' star.

714
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,600
I think I have a right to say-

715
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,320
That you love me.

716
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,360
How did you know
what I was going to say?

717
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,600
Because I can read you.

718
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,680
You love the crazy, the aging,
the sub-human Adam Stein.

719
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,040
Why is this?

720
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,400
Why?

721
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,840
A healthy Adam Stein, for you,
not so attractive.

722
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,400
It's important that you know,
really know.

723
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,080
Makes no difference why,
but I do with all my heart.

724
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
Yes, you're a whore, and I use you.

725
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,480
Now, listen, my landlady,
Ruthchen, the quiet type,

726
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,360
fucking her was like fucking butter.

727
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,200
Fucking you is like
fucking the motorcycle.

728
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,520
You're cruel, darling.

729
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,880
Oh, Gina, Gina,
it's a little humor.

730
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,880
Child, this is what saves everything.

731
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,240
Klein knew it well.

732
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
You can weed out
more sub-humans in a day

733
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,760
with humor and Zyklon B

734
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,280
than you can with Zyklon B alone.

735
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,600
It's the combination.

736
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,120
Yeah.

737
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,720
Adam.

738
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
What are you doing in there?

739
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,760
Adam, you devil.

740
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,760
Well, it is Purim, after all,

741
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,760
and I can get another toothbrush.

742
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,400
Now, back to work.

743
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,880
We're almost done.

744
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,040
I still think he looks a little too-
I don't know-

745
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,120
healthy.

746
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,480
Don't you think?

747
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,480
Blacken the eye sockets,
for your Purim costume.

748
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,560
Rex, hold still.

749
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,600
And?

750
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,360
Oh yeah, of course, yeah, yeah.

751
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,560
Here we go, Rex.

752
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,720
Yeah, you're a prisoner.

753
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,720
Look scared; he is the Kommandant.

754
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,560
Wonderful.

755
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,200
A Purim to remember.

756
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,600
Kommandant, my family.

757
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,400
You're a comfort, Adam...

758
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,680
a lifesaver.

759
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Before you came, it was killing me.

760
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,240
Now it's better.

761
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,200
Bravo.

762
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,280
Bravo, maestro.

763
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,280
Whoo!

764
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,600
Adam, Adam.

765
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,640
- Schwester.
- Adam?

766
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,200
You are looking today so very,
very transcendent.

767
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,280
Thank you.

768
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,640
Tell me, have you been grooming

769
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,000
this little moustachio of yours?

770
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,600
Oh, this is so becoming on a woman.

771
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
It's a very, very striking
kind of thing of course.

772
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,640
But do you not think it is a little warm

773
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,440
for the woolen Unterhosen?

774
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Thank you.

775
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,400
Adam, I prayed for you to return,

776
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,640
and you did.

777
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,120
That was nice, Schwester,
bringing a man back into prison

778
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,840
when he's having such a swell time
on the outside.

779
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,200
L'Chaim, Schwester.

780
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,520
Mmm.

781
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,560
I accept your assignment.

782
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,040
I will be your holy ventriloquist.

783
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,720
But just now, I have got to see
a man about a dog, shalom.

784
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,040
Woe be the shepherds of Israel
that feed themselves.

785
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,080
Auf Wiedersehen.

786
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,840
Shouldn't the shepherds feed the flocks?

787
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,120
Good-bye.

788
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,320
I am so sorry that I just
popped up before and ran off.

789
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,680
I got thirsty.

790
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,120
Did they torture you?

791
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,160
Who was it?

792
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,240
Golomb?

793
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,280
That tiny Torquemada
with the jangling keys?

794
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,160
Sturmfuehrer Slonim?

795
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,600
You can tell me.

796
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,120
You're the only one that I can talk to

797
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,840
in this godforsaken place.

798
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,920
Yes, you are not a phony.

799
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,680
And to me, this is a-
this is a very big deal.

800
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,080
Believe me,
I can sniff one a mile away.

801
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,400
And so can you, can you not?

802
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,880
It is you and Adam Stein
against the world.

803
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,800
You and I, we are going to...
take the trial run.

804
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,080
On we go.

805
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,000
Yes, I know you're a dog.

806
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,920
I understand.

807
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,920
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

808
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
Don't panic.

809
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,720
No, this is laundry, dirty laundry.

810
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,400
Yeah, let's take a little tour.

811
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,440
Oh, look who's here.

812
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,640
Look who's coming.

813
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,680
Do you really think
this is doing the boy any good?

814
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,720
He's a dog, Gina.

815
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,800
Show a little respect.

816
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,000
- Come on.
- Hey.

817
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,680
Yeah, this is Gina Grey's classy ass.

818
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,720
Shoo.

819
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,800
Yeah, looky, look who's here.

820
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,440
Look at them, kid.

821
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,080
These- these wretched souls
have- have chimneys for hearts.

822
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,080
And Gross tries to heal them
with, mescaline, LSD,

823
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,880
hypnotherapy.

824
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,200
Knows that it cannot be done.

825
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,640
And Seizling?

826
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,760
Yeah, she thought she could save
these walking tombstones too.

827
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,360
Thought I could save them.

828
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,200
But I never said that I could.

829
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
I never promised them the burning bush.

830
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,840
Go away, Arthur.

831
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,520
Go light a fire.

832
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,320
How's the knitting, by the way?

833
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,360
You're not the rebel you think you are.

834
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,440
You know what?

835
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,480
Look over there.

836
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,840
There's a man behind the curtain,

837
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,920
pulling your strings.

838
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,760
Yeah, I'm giving another talk tomorrow.

839
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,920
A history of drama from the dawn of man
till the present

840
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,320
entitled "Whisky and Dramaturgie".

841
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,640
Do try to come.

842
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,520
All right, are we all here?

843
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,560
Yes, we are.

844
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,800
Then let's- let's begin.

845
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,560
Mm.

846
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,480
A dog barks.

847
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,960
But a dog barking on a stage
is no longer a dog.

848
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,440
This bottle, for instance, I pour.

849
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,440
I raise this glass to my mouth,
and I swallow.

850
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,480
Mm.

851
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,440
But am I really drinking,

852
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,400
or am I a man playing a man
who is drinking?

853
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,760
Close your eyes.

854
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,720
Yeah, that's right.

855
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,520
Not so fast, Arthur.

856
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,560
You've got to register first, please.

857
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,800
Name.

858
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,000
Schwester, you know my name.

859
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,280
Arthur, we all registered.

860
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,560
Name?

861
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,040
Arthur.

862
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,120
Last name.

863
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,160
Fine.

864
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,200
Arthur Fine.

865
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,080
Perfectly fine, Arthur.

866
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,440
Schwester, where was I?

867
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,600
"But am I really drinking, or am-"

868
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,640
Exactly, folks.

869
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,400
We're all actors...

870
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,560
in a drama which both playwright

871
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,760
and director have long ago abandoned.

872
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,920
Nonetheless, meine sehr
verehrten Damen und Herren,

873
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,920
ladies and gentlemen,
to bring the curtain down is impossible.

874
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,600
The show must go on.

875
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,400
Hey, what's going on?

876
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,600
He's drunk.

877
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,920
He's really drinking up there.

878
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,960
Adam, you're a liar.

879
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,920
Nonsense.

880
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,960
Nonsense, Arthur.

881
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,160
It is water.

882
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,760
You, of all people, should appreciate

883
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,360
what I'm trying to teach
these people, the artifice,

884
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,440
the necessary lie
that we all needed to survive.

885
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,720
Mm-hmm.

886
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,160
Here, here, here's a quick example.

887
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
Yeah.

888
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,520
It is 1945.

889
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,560
It is dark.

890
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,320
A man is running through the Naliboki Forest

891
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,960
with a cocktail?

892
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,480
A Molotov cocktail, yeah.

893
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,480
The war is over,
but not everyone knows it yet.

894
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,840
Arthur Fine has been in the camps,

895
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,080
escaped,

896
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,640
lived underground,
with the Bielski Partisans.

897
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,960
Yes, laughter.

898
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,760
For us, back there, no other way.

899
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,640
But then you came to Palestine,

900
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,600
this theater of the absurd.

901
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,960
And for a while,
you forgot the first rule of Dramaturgie.

902
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,720
You found a wife, a daughter.

903
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,320
But it seems you were merely observing

904
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,440
the second law of Dramaturgie,
the pause,

905
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,280
because soon the fires burned again.

906
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,640
Laughter sprang forth.

907
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,840
You laughed as you set fire
to your house.

908
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,880
No.

909
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,400
Your wife, your little girl.

910
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,880
- Bastard.
- To yourself.

911
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,520
Then one day, Mrs. Seizling
showed up at the burn ward.

912
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,600
Fortunately, the Dachau number
on your arm was preserved,

913
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,080
and she recognized you
as one of her flock.

914
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,160
You.

915
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,520
Curtain.

916
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,360
Now, the point of this demonstration?

917
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:46,040
Just as sadness creates tears,
so laughter creates the joy.

918
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,480
Don't look so horrified,

919
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,080
meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren,

920
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,480
to laugh, yeah.

921
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,080
If I had not been able
to laugh back there,

922
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,160
I would be dead.

923
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,040
Me, you, all of us.

924
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,440
And in room 285,

925
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,440
there sits a young mutt
who is laughing at us all.

926
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,480
What does he think,

927
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,760
he is better than the rest of us?

928
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,400
I will later give him some corrections.

929
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,000
Open your mouths.

930
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,040
Wide.

931
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,720
Wider.

932
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,320
Relax the neck muscles.

933
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,320
Wrinkle the noses.

934
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,840
Take a deep breath.

935
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,040
Perfect.

936
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,200
Ah.

937
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,440
And laugh.

938
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,920
Ha, ha.

939
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,480
Louder.

940
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,200
Everyone.

941
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,240
Louder, louder.

942
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,600
What are you doing?

943
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,400
- Louder, louder.
- What are you doing?

944
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,440
Everyone.

945
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,840
I know that it hurts, yeah.

946
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,920
No.

947
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,000
Look at me.

948
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,040
- I am burning.
- No.

949
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,920
I am dying, but I can laugh.

950
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,120
No, stop it!

951
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,760
Stop laughing!

952
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,800
He's like a dog.

953
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,520
He's telling us what to do.

954
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,280
He licked his boot.

955
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,320
What do you want from me?

956
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,920
All right, come here.

957
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,600
Let's get this dog collar off of you.

958
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,160
Intestinal bleeding, swollen limbs.

959
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,960
Acute renal failure, I knew it.

960
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,000
I knew it.

961
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,920
Adam!

962
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,200
Gretchen.

963
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,200
- Papa.
- Oh, my dearest one.

964
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,240
Adam.

965
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,480
Try to find her.
Ruthie.

966
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,520
Adam.

967
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,680
Please, Papa.

968
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,040
I love you.

969
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,240
Adam.

970
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,440
Play!

971
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,480
Play!

972
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,040
These people need some Marschmusik.

973
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,280
Play!

974
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,360
What the hell is that?

975
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,160
Shut up.

976
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,280
He's not dead, okay?

977
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,040
It was Purim 1942.

978
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,440
The SS were going door-to-door,
clearing out the ghetto.

979
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,000
My Naomi,
my beautiful little Naomi,

980
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,280
she was Queen Esther that year.

981
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,320
I'd sewn her a dress
and made a crown from a tin can.

982
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,360
That night after services,
we snuck out.

983
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,440
The Nazis were a few blocks away,

984
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,160
so I knew we had some time.

985
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,280
Just outside of the ghetto,
there lived a Mrs. Marshack.

986
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,600
She used to bring me
all her children's coats to mend.

987
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,440
And in her house,
there was a basement.

988
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,440
And under the basement,
there was another basement,

989
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,720
a pit with a trapdoor.

990
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,960
Down that pit went my- my little queen.

991
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:54,080
As we left her there,
I could hear her whispering,

992
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,040
"Why, Daddy?"

993
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,600
13 months she was down there, Adam.

994
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,480
She was a child.

995
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,920
Her body had to grow,

996
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,200
and this crown,

997
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,080
she never took off this damned crown.

998
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,680
That heartless, blind,
mute son of a bitch.

999
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,720
Why?

1000
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,080
Why?

1001
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,920
Come on, you tyrant!

1002
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,000
Why?

1003
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,040
Wolfowitz.

1004
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,200
- Tell me why?
- That's enough.

1005
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,360
You're gonna hurt someone.

1006
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,280
Tarshish.

1007
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,520
This is the point.

1008
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,560
Take me inside.

1009
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,720
Let him let out some steam, please.

1010
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,880
Let him- let him do it.

1011
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,800
Why, God?

1012
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,880
Why?

1013
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,880
Why?

1014
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,320
He misses you, Adam, the kid.

1015
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,120
You know, he didn't really think
you were going to hurt him.

1016
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,520
He told you that, did he?

1017
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,960
Well, you tell him for me
that he is better off without me.

1018
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,080
He was watching you type just now.

1019
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,400
Tarshish, this is crap.

1020
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,680
No, Adam.

1021
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,560
Get away from me, please.

1022
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,600
Wait, Adam.

1023
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,160
Tarshish, I am tired.
Leave me alone.

1024
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,240
What in God's name?

1025
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,320
Don't tell anyone, okay?

1026
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,880
I'm counting on you.

1027
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,120
- No crazy stuff.
- Right.

1028
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,640
Wait, wait.

1029
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,360
Do not give me this look, kid.

1030
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,960
I was sick.

1031
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,680
I was dying.

1032
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,920
Kidney leaking with the white ashes.

1033
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,280
Oh, we're no good for each other, kid.

1034
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,760
Oh, this is not going to work.

1035
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,080
What do you want, my Olivetti?

1036
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,280
What, you saw me writing Wolfie's eulogy,

1037
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,800
now you want to write mine?

1038
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,400
That's, you know,
that's very intuit- intuitive.

1039
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,520
But let's not do it.

1040
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,320
Do it on the paper.

1041
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,360
Wait a minute.

1042
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,600
You're going to jam it.

1043
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,800
Here, I'll put it on the floor.

1044
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,600
Try that out.

1045
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,560
Well, damn it, kid.

1046
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,720
You're the little maestro.

1047
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,720
Why the hell didn't you say so?

1048
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,200
Okay.

1049
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,000
I can see that you're the sentient being,

1050
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,720
and sentient beings need what?

1051
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,920
The name.

1052
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,640
Here, maybe something that you're typing

1053
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,720
can give us an idea.

1054
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,200
Here, let me see.

1055
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,160
Ah, "fdg fdga".

1056
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,720
Yeah, that has a mysterious ring to it.

1057
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:57,480
But how about something
with a little symbolism?

1058
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,080
You know who you remind me of?

1059
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,400
David.

1060
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,760
David Rex.

1061
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,360
Yeah, king of the Jews,

1062
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,400
descendant of Adam,
forebearer of the Messiah,

1063
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,640
musician,

1064
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,120
fornicator,

1065
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,040
bloodthirsty warrior,

1066
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,480
built Jerusalem,

1067
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,680
brought in God in this...

1068
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,080
box.

1069
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,240
Yeah.

1070
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,960
Long live Davey, king of dogs.

1071
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,480
Purim, our day of joy.

1072
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,560
Bah.

1073
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,720
Look at that, Adam.

1074
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,240
They want us to dress up in costumes.

1075
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,640
He saved us from Haman
only to toss us to Hitler.

1076
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,960
God's logic is not our logic,
Mr. Wolfowitz,

1077
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,160
nor can we begin to fathom His ways.

1078
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,720
2,000 years we've stood face-to-face,
Him and us.

1079
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,760
Then he turned and sicced Rex on us.

1080
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,000
Still, you're a believer, Mr. Wolfowitz,

1081
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,840
and Adam too.

1082
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,200
And your tirades, gentlemen,

1083
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,960
are nothing but manifestos of faith.

1084
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,360
Schwester, this is very clever.

1085
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,640
- Did I say this?
- Of course.

1086
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,840
I write it all down.

1087
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Oy, soon, Adam-

1088
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,640
Schwester, give him a-
throw him some scraps.

1089
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
Ah, evolution is hard work.

1090
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,440
Oh, the little embryo is evolving

1091
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,960
a million years at a time.

1092
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,440
Come on, we have got some work to do.

1093
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,920
Writing, Adam?
What is he writing?

1094
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,680
Poetry, poetry, Wolfie,
sheer unadulterated poetry.

1095
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,080
Blumers, Mrs. Lipowitz.

1096
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,000
Stop by my- Adam's circus

1097
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:28,480
and see the miraculous offspring
of Olivetti und Rex.

1098
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,520
Heel.

1099
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,560
Heel, come on, let's go.

1100
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,160
Adam.

1101
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,760
No, no, no, heel, heel.

1102
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,360
Come on. Come on.

1103
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,040
David.

1104
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,520
Wait, Adam, me first.

1105
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,000
We were in Mrs. Marshack's basement.

1106
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:53,320
13 months she was down there, Adam.

1107
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,600
How much is that in numbers?

1108
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,520
13 months is, um-

1109
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:04,640
Well, it's 390 days, 9,360 hours.

1110
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:11,760
561,600 minutes she sat there...

1111
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,560
waiting.

1112
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,160
Why, God?

1113
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,240
Why?

1114
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,560
"May his question soon be answered.

1115
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:29,000
Signed, Abe Wolfowitz."

1116
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,880
Then you say Kaddish, Adam,

1117
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,320
and maybe serve some refreshments.

1118
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,640
You lived, right?

1119
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,760
That's what matters.

1120
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,720
Yeah, yeah.

1121
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,680
The circus is here?

1122
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,400
Yes, it sure is, come on.

1123
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,280
Come on, look how excited Rachel is.

1124
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,280
Come on, yeah, oh, everyone's come.

1125
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Thank you. Thank you.

1126
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,440
Thank you, darling.

1127
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,480
Thank you, Mr. Blum, yeah.

1128
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,720
Come on, Arthur.

1129
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,400
All right.

1130
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,880
Thank you.

1131
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,600
Do the reading outside.

1132
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,040
Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
meine Damen und Herren.

1133
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,120
This is your big chance.

1134
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,360
Ready?

1135
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,000
I give you the king of dogs,
Koenig der Hund,

1136
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,720
David.

1137
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,200
Bravo, bravo.

1138
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,720
Messages from Davey.

1139
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,360
For you.

1140
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,560
What?

1141
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,840
What?

1142
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,800
- What he is doing?
- "AT&T up 300 points."

1143
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,920
Bravo, Adam.

1144
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,920
He's speaking in tongues.

1145
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,800
When, Adam, when?

1146
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,000
What?

1147
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,560
He's been pounding out gibberish.

1148
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,440
Nathan, we've been treating that boy
for two months now,

1149
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,520
making our way through his defenses,

1150
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,240
and along comes Adam Stein
with a typewriter,

1151
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,520
and you're beaming at me
like you've invented penicillin.

1152
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,440
Well, I'm sure Adam
will be more than delighted

1153
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,520
to share the credit.

1154
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,920
Nathan, please.

1155
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,360
Adam is unstable.

1156
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,040
He's dangerous.

1157
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,040
Instead of restricting him,
increasing his medication,

1158
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,720
you give him unlimited access
to the Institute.

1159
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,960
You turn a blind eye to his alcohol,

1160
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,720
his love affair with your head nurse.

1161
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,400
Read.

1162
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,640
What do you mean, read?

1163
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,160
Leave Adam to me.

1164
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,560
"Gina Grey's classy ass."

1165
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,880
You know what?

1166
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,600
Why don't we just let the patients
cure each other,

1167
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,240
and you and I can sit around
in our pajamas playing cards?

1168
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,240
That is the most sensible thing
you've ever said.

1169
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,240
Oh, fine, fine, fine.

1170
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,360
That is my boy, David.

1171
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,680
This is my king of dogs.

1172
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,880
Do not eat the-
do not eat the paper.

1173
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,040
Ow.

1174
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,560
Stop this.

1175
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,520
You are not a dog.

1176
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,800
Do you know why I came back?

1177
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,280
I could have died, kid, yeah.

1178
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,320
The heart was blocked.

1179
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,960
Slonim was pounding my chest,
calling my name.

1180
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,400
There was nothing else he could do.

1181
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,120
And I was wrestling with the Angel of Death.

1182
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,720
I stopped him at the gate.

1183
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,160
Do you know why?

1184
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,600
Huh?

1185
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,600
To see you again.

1186
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,040
That is why.

1187
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,800
I love you, child.

1188
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,000
But it's no damn good.

1189
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,400
You lean on me,
we will both go tumbling down together.

1190
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,200
Zyklot 17.

1191
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,720
Rex would have preferred it that way,
don't you think?

1192
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,880
When the Russians arrive,
they will shoot him like a dog.

1193
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,920
Get up.

1194
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,520
I have something to show you.

1195
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,720
Baron Von Hamdung.

1196
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,040
Do you know the name?

1197
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,960
Iron industry, shipping, petroleum.

1198
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,880
Not long after the war broke out,

1199
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,400
he was accused of treason.

1200
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,680
His entire estate,

1201
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,160
Swiss bank accounts, holdings,
were nationalized.

1202
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,120
A clever SS accountant-

1203
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,920
well, I thought I was clever
at the time-

1204
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,480
was put in charge.

1205
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,200
He was meticulous,

1206
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,360
which is how he rose so fast
through the ranks.

1207
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,280
But this one file, he put aside.

1208
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,000
In fact, he stole it.

1209
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,880
And incredibly, it was never missed.

1210
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,760
Patton's Third Army has crossed the Danube.

1211
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,040
The Russians are in Berlin.

1212
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,480
It's the end.

1213
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,080
For me, this document is useless.

1214
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,840
But we had a deal, you and I.

1215
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,520
A life for a life.

1216
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,880
So here.

1217
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,800
It's Von Hamdung's last will,

1218
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,960
the rights to his home and possessions,

1219
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,320
and you are the sole beneficiary.

1220
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,120
You've been a good dog.

1221
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,360
The truth is,
I could have saved your family,

1222
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,520
but it would have been inconvenient.

1223
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,400
I would have had some explaining to do.

1224
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,920
Do it.

1225
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,840
So there's life
in the old clown yet, eh, Adam?

1226
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,320
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

1227
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,880
Adam Stein is at home?

1228
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,400
Herr, Hermann Lichtenstein.

1229
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,240
Rabbi.

1230
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,920
Welcome to Valhalla.

1231
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,560
Adam.

1232
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,120
Look at us.

1233
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,080
How can it be?

1234
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,000
Oh, Rabbi.

1235
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,600
It is- it's only dynamite.

1236
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,480
They're putting up an apartment block next door.

1237
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,440
But on my land,
no resurrection will occur.

1238
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,840
You have the word of Von Hamdung.

1239
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,200
How did you find me?

1240
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,600
The only Jew in Germany
should be hard to find?

1241
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,080
You're in the papers, Adam,
the newsreels.

1242
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,880
Let me ask you.

1243
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,480
Your daughter, the older one, Ruthie,

1244
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,320
did you ever try to locate her?

1245
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,640
Such a cheerful presence, Rabbi.

1246
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,920
Truly, you light up the room.

1247
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,160
I'm sorry, Adam.

1248
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,320
But I have to.

1249
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,400
She's dead.

1250
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,320
We both are.

1251
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,680
What is the point?

1252
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,320
But if you have to, what, know?

1253
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,960
Yeah, I did.

1254
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,200
For four years, I looked.

1255
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,640
I put Von Hamdung's blood money
to good use, believe me.

1256
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,120
Then it dawned on me, Rabbi.

1257
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,080
If she was alive,

1258
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,200
then it was she
who was not looking for me.

1259
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,280
Adam.

1260
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,400
She would be 25 this year.

1261
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,880
She would have heard about the antics
of her famous father

1262
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,480
who was once a dog
and is now not much of anything.

1263
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,080
And who in the world could blame her

1264
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,800
if she chose to be silent?

1265
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,720
We survived.

1266
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,600
It's not a crime.

1267
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,040
A crime is to blame yourself
instead of them.

1268
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,560
Now, listen to me.

1269
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,400
She is alive.

1270
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,320
She was in a holding camp after the war.

1271
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,280
She married an Italian,

1272
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,120
and last year,
they moved to Israel.

1273
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,200
Heinz.

1274
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,240
She lives as a Christian in Haifa.

1275
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,920
We were notified three weeks ago

1276
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,240
when she was admitted
to the Franciscan Hospital.

1277
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,960
They looked at her papers and contacted us.

1278
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,560
Hospital?

1279
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,680
The Nazis, they injured her,
body and soul,

1280
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,080
but she lived.

1281
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,880
And now, thank God,

1282
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,800
you are about to become a grandfather.

1283
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,400
I think it's time to talk to her.

1284
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:17,760
And if not to be forgiven,
then maybe at least to be heard.

1285
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,560
Rabbi, you have some nerve
coming here to my sarcophagus.

1286
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,760
Heinz, get my gun.

1287
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,720
Her name and address,
should you so choose.

1288
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,160
You don't have to punish yourself, Adam.

1289
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,360
Why stay in Berlin?

1290
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,280
What's keeping you here?

1291
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,720
You're not dead yet, Adam.

1292
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,640
It's so hot in here.

1293
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,680
Why is it so hot?

1294
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,840
It's a hothouse, Adam.

1295
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,320
Hothouse in the desert, typical.

1296
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,000
What is he growing anyway?

1297
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:07,000
Oh, melons, tomatoes,
herbs for the kitchen.

1298
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,760
Hey.

1299
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:16,320
Today you were thinking about Gretchen.

1300
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,880
Oh, no, no.

1301
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,280
Lady, this is not so nice.

1302
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,840
You have no right to be brooding
about Gretchen.

1303
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,160
That woman had faith in me.

1304
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,360
Adam clowning around
as she took her final steps,

1305
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,400
and she had faith in me.

1306
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,480
You have faith in no one.

1307
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,600
I have faith in you.

1308
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,960
You are lying.

1309
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,000
Don't, please.

1310
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,640
No one's been able
to get through to him but you,

1311
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,160
the poor child.

1312
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,200
It is not a child.

1313
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,440
Do not call him the child.

1314
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,600
- Dog, he's a dog.
- He types on a typewriter.

1315
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,280
He doesn't bark anymore.

1316
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,600
You, God, made him into a child.

1317
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,800
He was non-human; now he is human.

1318
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,920
Wait a minute.

1319
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,040
Are you jealous?

1320
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,720
Why can't I be jealous?

1321
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,880
Of course I'm jealous.

1322
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,680
I'm jealous of the boy.

1323
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,880
I'm jealous of Gretchen.

1324
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,240
We used to be together so much before.

1325
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,600
I used to bark for you.

1326
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,360
I can still bark.

1327
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,160
You are not a-
you are not a dog.

1328
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,760
Gina.

1329
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,000
Bitch at heart.

1330
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,600
You- stop barking.

1331
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,040
Stop barking.

1332
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,160
You're not going to come between us.

1333
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,360
This child is mine.

1334
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,840
We are two dogs in the desert.

1335
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,120
I took off his mask,
and now he wants my power.

1336
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,920
I cannot be the true dog.

1337
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,400
Neither can he.

1338
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,720
He's a child.

1339
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,360
He needs love.

1340
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,920
You had better not interfere.

1341
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,360
Keep going, kid.

1342
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,440
We are going to do this.

1343
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,920
Marsch, hund.

1344
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,400
Come on, hey.

1345
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,600
You see this fence?

1346
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,040
You are going to grab onto the fence

1347
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,120
and stand on your feet.

1348
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,160
This is all your fault.

1349
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,240
Everything I did for you,

1350
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,600
and now for me,
you are going to do one thing.

1351
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,280
Here we go.
Stand.

1352
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,760
Oh.

1353
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,000
Ah, hund, hund.

1354
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,400
Come on, schnell.

1355
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,560
Okay, you ever been to a circus, huh?

1356
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,040
Bears, horses, lions,

1357
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,520
every goddamn creature on this Earth.

1358
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,840
Even Arthur Fine can stand on two feet.

1359
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,880
You're not the dog.

1360
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,960
You're not the boy.

1361
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,520
Come on, come on, come on.

1362
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,840
David, David.

1363
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,920
That's it, darling.

1364
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,000
Do it.

1365
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,120
Do it.

1366
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,760
David, yeah.

1367
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,920
He's a boy, Adam.

1368
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,960
He's a child.

1369
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,520
I told you to leave us alone.

1370
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,880
I warned you.

1371
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,080
So what are you?

1372
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,440
Lizard?

1373
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,720
Leech?

1374
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,880
The little rat?

1375
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,800
Okay.

1376
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,240
Yes, okay.

1377
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,520
Yeah.

1378
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,480
And stop.

1379
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,640
David, get down.

1380
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,920
That is- that's enough.

1381
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,080
Oh, no, no, no, let him.

1382
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,160
He's making it.

1383
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,720
Whore, leave me alone.

1384
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,800
David.

1385
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,400
David, yeah,
this is enough for one day.

1386
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,840
Down, down, down you go.

1387
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,000
Down, please.

1388
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,360
All right, no more.

1389
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,400
I am not ready yet.

1390
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,480
I cannot do it.

1391
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,080
I'm dying.

1392
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,120
Please, please, please.

1393
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,160
Please.

1394
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,280
Shut up.

1395
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,320
Look...

1396
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,560
at me.

1397
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,760
Look.

1398
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,040
Look.

1399
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,040
Come on, help me.

1400
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,080
Okay, I got him.

1401
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,160
Let's go.

1402
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,400
This time you've gone too far, Adam.

1403
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,800
- Too far.
- It's all right.

1404
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,320
It's okay; you made it.

1405
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,760
You're a man,

1406
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,440
our man.

1407
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,040
David?

1408
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,800
Come on, kid.

1409
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,800
You can do it.

1410
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,000
Come on.

1411
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,960
My God, Adam.

1412
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,600
Come on, come on.

1413
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,840
Oh, okay.

1414
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,320
Go back to Europe, you old soap.

1415
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,000
My name is Adam Stein.

1416
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,160
I'm looking for my daughter Ruthie.

1417
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,240
Joe Gracci.

1418
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,600
Oh, Joseph.

1419
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,640
Come in, please.

1420
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,920
Yeah, so nice to meet you.

1421
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,280
Am I interrupting something?

1422
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,040
Would you like some coffee?

1423
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,160
I think you should leave now.

1424
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,880
Thank you very much for the flowers.

1425
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,480
Outside, please.

1426
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,960
Please, outside.

1427
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,040
When?

1428
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,320
When- when did she-

1429
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,800
When?

1430
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,200
When she found out what you had done.

1431
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,280
That's when she died for the first time.

1432
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,320
And then with every report that came in,
she died again.

1433
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,240
The Commandant's pet, huh, wasn't it?

1434
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,320
You, what, you played

1435
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,000
while your wife and your daughter

1436
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,280
went to the ovens?

1437
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,800
Huh? And Ruthie?

1438
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,480
Do you even know what they did to her?

1439
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,560
Where is she?

1440
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,600
Wherever she is right now,

1441
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,720
she doesn't want you to be there.

1442
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,640
I guarantee you that.

1443
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,000
We know about you, Adam Stein.

1444
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,240
You lived on Nazi money in a Nazi mansion.

1445
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,280
I can find it.

1446
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,440
I can find the grave on my own.

1447
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
Don't you dare.

1448
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,040
I'll take you.

1449
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,080
Spare a pfennig?

1450
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,800
It's over there.

1451
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,960
They bury them together
when they're that young.

1452
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,400
A boy, by the way.

1453
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,000
You know, it's funny, I...

1454
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,040
I never once saw her laugh.

1455
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,120
A clown's daughter,

1456
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,240
and she could barely break a smile.

1457
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,320
So?

1458
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,440
They say you were quite the performer
back there, huh?

1459
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,200
Now, go ahead.

1460
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,560
Make her smile now.

1461
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,160
Go on, Dad.

1462
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,400
Do something funny for your little girl.

1463
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,680
And so I found a home in the desert.

1464
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,560
Rebecca Seizling herself greeted me
at her Institute.

1465
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,880
And she looked me in the eye

1466
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,280
and knew that she had met
her prized puppy.

1467
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,080
But the joke was on her.

1468
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,840
I lived; she died.

1469
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,680
A boy who is not a dog after all.

1470
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:09,000
Spare a pfennig?

1471
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,720
Oh, ma- ha, yeah, ha.

1472
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,320
Ruthie, do not be frightened.

1473
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,480
Ah, my beautiful wife, Gretchen.

1474
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,320
Genug!

1475
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,840
Purim?

1476
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,200
You're celebrating?

1477
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,800
Oh, Purim, on account of that
one poor son of a bitch Haman?

1478
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,400
What about the eight trillion tears?

1479
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,080
Who is going to pay for those?

1480
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,360
The eight trillion teeth and soap suds?

1481
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,080
Skin and bones?

1482
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,440
The unfertilized sperm,
the unborn children,

1483
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,000
the unwritten books,
the unrequited loves,

1484
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,040
the unslept-in beds, huh?

1485
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,760
You're the God who sends out Stormtroopers,

1486
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,520
multiplies their brain cells,
makes them smarter than us?

1487
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,680
No, I will show you show you
what we're celebrating.

1488
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,320
Schwester, who are you?

1489
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,480
Rachel Schwester.

1490
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,600
No, hold up your arm.

1491
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,560
What does it say?

1492
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,000
Six, one, three, four, five.

1493
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:23,160
Then who are you?

1494
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,800
I'm six, one, three, four, five.

1495
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:25,880
Yes.

1496
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,920
Blum, you?

1497
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,080
Two, four, two, two, five.

1498
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,560
Yes, who are we, yeah?

1499
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,640
The rest of you, roll up the sleeve.

1500
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,160
Raise those arms.

1501
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,960
Zelda, she knew what she was doing
all these years.

1502
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,480
Smile, all of you.

1503
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,520
It does not hurt.

1504
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,840
It did; it does not anymore.

1505
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,920
Arms straight up.

1506
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:47,120
We are this very night an army of arms.

1507
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,480
Shout out your numbers.

1508
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,240
Let him know that we are not dead.

1509
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,720
Sieben, sechs, drei, vier, fuenf.

1510
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,600
Six, one, three, four, five.

1511
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,520
Seven, one, three, oh, two.

1512
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,440
Eight, four, two, nine, six.

1513
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,480
Seven, one, three, oh-

1514
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,840
Seven, one, three, oh, two!

1515
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,520
Seven, one, three, oh, two!

1516
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,760
Show yourself.

1517
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,160
Show yourself.

1518
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,320
Show yourself.

1519
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,360
Show yourself.

1520
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:09,400
Adam.

1521
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,520
Adam.

1522
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,480
On all fours, Adam.

1523
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,800
It's funnier that way.

1524
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,240
Adam Stein.

1525
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,800
The funniest man in Germany.

1526
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,880
Why are you here, Klein?

1527
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,480
Did you really think

1528
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,040
you could be rid of me so easily?

1529
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,960
I have been here all along.

1530
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,840
I am part of you.

1531
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,120
Me you brought with you from Berlin.

1532
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,000
Me you brought with you on the boat.

1533
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,160
Me you carried into the desert
in your suitcase.

1534
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:57,480
Adam.

1535
01:31:58,840 --> 01:31:59,760
Adam.

1536
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,320
What are you looking for, Adam?

1537
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,600
Try and find her.

1538
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,920
Ruthie?

1539
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,040
You weren't much help to them,
were you?

1540
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,040
Your wife and daughters.

1541
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,040
I do not need you anymore.

1542
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,440
It is only you and me.

1543
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,920
We're one and the same.

1544
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,840
Adam.

1545
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,440
We have unfinished business.

1546
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,800
Isn't it time for the curtain to come down?

1547
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,320
Hasn't Adam's circus gone on long enough?

1548
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,400
Now do it!

1549
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,400
Do it.

1550
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,680
Do it.

1551
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,680
And you'll be rid of me.

1552
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,600
It's the only way.

1553
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,040
Do it.

1554
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,840
Nein.

1555
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,360
It is not.

1556
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,840
I thought you left me.

1557
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,600
I was here all the time.

1558
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,240
You went away.

1559
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,840
I'm back.

1560
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:38,760
Rebecca Seizling's Institute
continues as before.

1561
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,000
For Rachel Schwester, for Arthur,
and for the rest,

1562
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,640
life goes on.

1563
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,720
Abe Wolfowitz, his prophecy,
however, did come true.

1564
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,520
He died in his sleep

1565
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,240
on the very night that he had predicted.

1566
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,400
In the years since I left the Institute,

1567
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,440
Gina Grey has not come once to Tel Aviv
for the visit.

1568
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,160
The moment I recovered,
Adam Stein was, for her, buried.

1569
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:10,280
Dr. Nathan Gross,
who had absolute faith in my recovery,

1570
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,120
him I will miss.

1571
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:22,240
David was released that winter
into the custody of a relative.

1572
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,920
Gross has assured me that this relative

1573
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,800
is the upstanding citizen,
the family man,

1574
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,920
someone who can give the boy
the life that I cannot.

1575
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,800
I miss him, my Davey.

1576
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,400
He writes to me.

1577
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,720
I follow his progress,

1578
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,120
and I will visit him soon.

1579
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,720
But he has a life now,
his own life,

1580
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,960
and a home in which to grow up.

1581
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,320
As for me, I have become...

1582
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,960
the ordinary man.

1583
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:04,360
I returned to Ruth Edelson's pension.

1584
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,600
I could no longer give myself diseases

1585
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,840
nor bring about my own end.

1586
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,240
I no longer carry Klein inside me.

1587
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,520
I live in a lovely valley,

1588
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,920
but the heights are gone forever.

1589
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,920
There are no more frightful deserts,

1590
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,080
and I no longer leap into the fire.

1591
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,640
I am afraid that I will get burned.

1592
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,680
Sanity is pleasant and calm,

1593
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,680
but there is no greatness,
no true joy,

1594
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:45,160
nor the awful sorrow
that slashes the heart.
