军火贩
美国  剧情/喜剧/战争

2
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:55,000
*基于真实事件改编*

3
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:03,000
*2008年1月1日*

4
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,943
别这样!求求你们!
Please! Please!

5
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,079
对不起 我不会说阿尔巴尼亚语!
I'm sorry, I don't speak Albanian!

6
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,749
别打我!我听不懂你们在说什么!
Stop! I don't understand!

7
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,218
现在听懂了吗?
Do you understand now?

8
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,764
现在指着我头的是一把杰里科941手枪
<i>That's a Jericho 941
pointed at my head</i>

9
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,226
只需要花300美元 你就能在黑市里淘到
<i>You can get one
on the black market for $300</i>

10
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,435
懂了
Yeah

11
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,021
它是一把非常便携好用的武器
<i>It is a very reliable weapon</i>

12
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,983
我叫戴维・佩豪斯
<i>My name is David Packouz</i>

13
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,402
是一个国际军火贩
<i>And I'm an international arms dealer</i>

14
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,701
关于战争你都知道什么?
<i>What do you know about war?</i>

15
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:01,372
人们会告诉你战争就是爱国民主
<i>They'll tell you it's about
patriotism, democracy</i>

16
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,083
或是某个厌恶我们自由的家伙
<i>or some shit about the other guy
hating our freedom</i>

17
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,294
但是你想知道战争的真正意义吗?
<i>But you want to know
what it's really about?</i>

18
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,505
从这个画面里你看到了什么?
<i>What do you see?</i>

19
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,714
一个来自阿肯色的孩子
<i>A kid from Arkansas</i>

20
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,425
为了实现自己的爱国主义来到前线保家卫国?
<i>doing his patriotic duty
to defend his country?</i>

21
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,220
我看到了一个头盔 一双防火手套
<i>I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves,</i>

22
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,389
一件防弹衣 以及一把M16突击步枪
<i>body armor, and an M16</i>

23
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,642
我看见了17500美元
<i>I see $17,500</i>

24
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,979
装备一个美国士兵就需要这么多钱
<i>That's what it costs to outfit
one American soldier</i>

25
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,190
有超过两百万个战士
<i>Over two million soldiers</i>

26
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,276
在伊拉克和阿富汗战斗
<i>fought in Iraq and Afghanistan</i>

27
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,407
而这平均会花费美国纳税人每年约45亿美元……
<i>It cost the American taxpayer
$45 billion each year</i>

28
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,284
投入到这些战争当中 而这一部分钱
<i>just to pay the air conditioning bills</i>

29
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,119
才只够抵消空调的费用
<i>for those wars</i>

30
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,247
这才是战争的真正意义
<i>And that's what war is really about</i>

31
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,001
战争就是经济
<i>War is an economy</i>

32
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,379
如果有人告诉你战争不是这样
<i>Anybody who tells you otherwise</i>

33
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,965
那要么他是个蠢货 要么他正参与其中
<i>is either in on it or stupid</i>

34
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,471
但我当时还没认清这一点
<i>But I didn't know that yet</i>

35
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,727
很早以前我几乎什么都不知道
<i>Back then, I didn't know anything</i>

36
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,727
*2005年 迈阿密沙滩*

37
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,920
你不能在这里停车
You can't park here

38
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:37,009
嘿 伙计 2150号 有我的客户叫肖尔先生
Hey, man I just got
a client at 2150, Mr Shore

39
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,844
但是我来早了
I'm a few minutes early

40
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,180
是吗?但这里是封闭式社区
Yeah? It's a gated community

41
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,514
所以你还是不能在这里停车
You still can't park here

42
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,393
大麻在这里也是禁止的
You probably shouldn't
smoke that here, either

43
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,190
好吧 多谢提醒
Okay Thanks

44
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,460
关于我现阶段的生活是如何影响故事走向的
<i>There's a lot I could say
about this period in my life</i>

45
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,837
我可以说上三天三夜
<i>that would give context to this stow</i>

46
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,385
我可以谈我是如何……
<i>I could tell you how</i>

47
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,428
只上完一个学期就从大学辍学的
<i>I dropped out of college
after one semester</i>

48
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,932
左臀的肌肉感觉怎么样? - 还是很酸痛
- How's that left quad doing?
- It's still sore

49
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,476
我是如何和父母闹翻的
<i>Had a falling out with my parents</i>

50
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,730
我是如何辗转6份工作或自己辞职或被炒鱿鱼的
<i>How I either quit or got fired
from six different jobs</i>

51
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,526
就是这里 - 好的 放松
<i>- That's it</i>
- All right There we go

52
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,487
但现在回想起来
<i>But looking back</i>

53
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,323
我觉得最重要的事是
<i>I think the most important
thing to understand is</i>

54
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,410
我当时非常迷茫
<i>I was completely lost</i>

55
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,880
抱歉 毯子自己掉下去了
Sorry It fell

56
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,883
没关系 加里
That's okay, Gary

57
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,434
我当时22岁
<i>I was 22 years old</i>

58
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,730
专帮迈阿密海滩附近的富豪按摩 每小时赚75块
<i>massaging rich dudes in Miami Beach
for 75 bucks an hour</i>

59
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,317
但我受够了
<i>But I'd had enough</i>

60
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,819
是时候做出改变了
<i>It was time to change shit up</i>

61
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,365
而我有个好主意
<i>And I had a big idea</i>

62
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:27,365
*要学会发现机遇 才能赚钱*

63
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,385
我的计划就是把高质量的床单批发给……
<i>My plan was to sell
quality bed sheets wholesale</i>

64
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,512
南佛罗里达的所有养老院
<i>to all the retirement homes
in South Florida</i>

65
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,349
这里有上百家养老院
<i>And there were hundreds of them</i>

66
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,604
手感真轻柔 - 那肯定的
- It feels really soft
- It should

67
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,065
这是用的埃及棉 400纱支数
It's Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count

68
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,984
它的品质在家用上 已经算是上乘了
I mean, it's pretty much top of the line
for institutional use

69
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,737
我很纠结 这看起来挺贵的
I don't know It seems excessive

70
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,407
每一床才29美元 一点都不贵
Well, at $29 per unit,
it's far from excessive

71
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,578
戴维 你知道希尔戴尔里住的老人平均年龄吗?
David, do you know the average age
of a resident here at Hilldale?

72
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,039
额 不知道
Um, no, I don't

73
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,458
82岁 - 哇
- Eighty-two years old
- Wow

74
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,836
你有见过82岁老人的皮肤吗?
Have you ever seen the skin
on an 82-year-old man?

75
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,172
你有触摸过吗?
Have you ever felt it?

76
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,299
事实上 我摸过 我之前是一名按摩理疗师
Yeah Actually,
I'm a certified massage therapist

77
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,134
我很多的客户都是上了点年纪的
and a lot of my clients are elderly

78
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,386
那你就应该知道
Then you should know

79
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,388
如果给他们用这些床单
These sheets,

80
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,100
感觉就好比用开士米羊绒裹住一只蜥蜴
it would be like wrapping
a lizard in cashmere

81
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,976
你会这么做吗?
Would you do that?

82
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,146
你会把羊绒拿给蜥蜴用吗?
Would you wrap a lizard in cashmere?

83
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,566
我想不会
I guess not

84
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,111
那你凭什么指望我会?
Then why would you expect me to?

85
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,241
那是我侄子
- My nephew

86
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,284
他唱得很好 对吧?
He's good, right?

87
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:56,208
我把所有的积蓄都用来买了这65床高级床单
<i>I'd sunk my entire life savings
into 65 cases of premium bed sheets</i>

88
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,877
但我忽视了一个最残忍的事实
<i>but I overlooked one crucial factor</i>

89
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,631
根本就没人关心老年人过得怎么样
<i>No one really cares about old people</i>

90
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,469
你为什么不把它们退回去?
Why don't you just sell them back?

91
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,222
退不了 我是批发的
It doesn't work like that
I bought them in bulk

92
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,516
我完蛋了
I'm so fucked

93
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,143
你没完蛋
You're not fucked

94
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,019
皮特才完蛋了
<i>Pete's fucked</i>

95
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,480
他都死透了
He's dead

96
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,945
我的天那 是埃佛隆吗?
Holy shit Is that Efraim?

97
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,449
是的
Yeah

98
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,034
我以为他还在洛杉矶
I thought he was still in LA

99
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,911
我也是
Me too

100
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,705
他是个很好的朋友 - 谢谢
- He was a great friend
- Thank you

101
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,208
他看起来真有钱
He looks so tan

102
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,588
埃佛隆・迪乌利是我的发小
<i>Efraim Diveroli
was my best friend growing up</i>

103
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,631
但自从他10年级搬去
<i>But I hadn't seen him
since he was shipped off</i>

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,800
和他叔叔住之后 我就再也没见过他
<i>to live with his uncle in 10th grade</i>

105
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:51,180
我想我们的父母一定都想尽办法让我俩离得越远越好
<i>I think our parents wanted to keep us
as far apart as possible</i>

106
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,351
生命之书中是没有目录的
<i>There is no table of contents
in the Book of Life</i>

107
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,772
我们不知道现在所处的位置 是新篇章的开头还是结尾
<i>We don't know if we're at the beginning
of a new chapter, or the end of a story</i>

108
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,443
所以每当有新的一页翻开时
Which is why we must be grateful

109
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,820
我们要心存感激
every time the page turns

110
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,239
你回来就是为了参加葬礼?
Did you come back just for this?

111
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,742
当然不是!我根本就不认识什么皮特
Fuck no! I barely knew Pete

112
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,827
我是来找你的
I was hoping to see you here

113
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,996
知道你妈连你的电话号码都不给我吗?
You know your mom
wouldn't give me your number?

114
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,247
怎么 你有打去家里找我?
What, did you call my house?

115
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,708
没有 我当时正在操她
No, I was fucking her

116
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,836
她还是很恨我 对吗?
She still hates me, huh?

117
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,463
没错 是这样的
Yeah, most likely

118
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,215
我很想你 兄弟
I missed you, bro

119
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,508
我也是
Yeah, me too

120
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,635
我们去兜兜风吧
Let's go for a ride

121
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,928
额
Uh

122
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,013
不行 我4点钟有一个客户
I can't I got a client at 4:00

123
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,890
管他娘的 给我取消了
Fuck that shit Cancel it

124
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,642
你的好兄弟回来了
Your boy's back in town

125
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,144
来嘛!
<i>Come on!</i>

126
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,904
你怎么不在洛杉矶待着了 伙计?
<i>So, what happened with LA, man?</i>

127
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,113
为什么回来?
<i>Why did you move back?</i>

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,199
你知道我一直在我叔叔手下工作 对吧?
Oh, you know I was working
for my uncle, right?

129
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,952
对 我听说你们好像是枪贩什么的
Yeah, I heard that you were, like,
a gun dealer or something

130
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,119
差不多吧
Pretty much I mean,

131
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,623
我们现在警方拍卖会上
we'd buy seized weapons at police auctions
and resell them on the Internet

132
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,832
真不错
Cool

133
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,795
之前是挺不错的 直到我发现我叔叔从我这儿克扣了7万块
It was cool until my uncle
scumbagged me over 70 grand

134
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,755
天啊 7万?
Holy shit Seventy grand?

135
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,800
差不多吧 但去他妈的 我还是赚了不少钱
Whatever Fuck him
I made a bunch of money

136
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,886
所以决定回迈阿密自己干
I decided I'd come back to Miami,
start up my own shop

137
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,304
这样啊
<i>Cool</i>

138
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,807
我们要找的那个人住哪儿啊?
Yo, where's this guy live?

139
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,142
还有大概5分钟就到 你赶时间吗?
It's, like, five more minutes
You got somewhere you gotta be?

140
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,894
不
No

141
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,397
好的 我有点不好判断到底哪种情况更糟
All right So, I can't figure out
which is worse

142
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,816
是你向养老院兜售床单
The fact that you sell
bed sheets to old age homes

143
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,651
还是你给人打手枪赚钱
or that you jerk guys off for money

144
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,321
再提醒你一次 我是一名有执照的按摩理疗师好吗?
For the record,
I'm a licensed massage therapist, okay?

145
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,823
完全合法的工作
Totally legit

146
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,243
好吧 但是到最后那些人还是会高潮的 对吧?
Okay But at the end,
the guys have to come, right?

147
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,869
是射在你胸口 还是什么地方?
Like, on your chest or whatever?

148
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,080
知道吗?去你妈的
You know what? Fuck you

149
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,082
去你的伙计
<i>- Fuck you, buddy</i>

150
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,043
兄弟 你还记得我们最后一次一起去买大麻的情景吗?
Bro, do you remember the last time
we went to buy weed together?

151
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,296
当然记得 真是他妈痛苦的经历
Of course I do It was fucking traumatic

152
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,048
没错 但你记得第二天
Yeah, but do you remember the next day,
when we walked into school

153
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,217
然后所有人都知道我们被逮捕的事吗?
and everybody knew that we got arrested?

154
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,303
记得 我们是不法分子
Yeah, we were gangsters, bro

155
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,847
我记得我们好像去了南海滩
We thought we ran South Beach

156
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,849
犹太学校肯定是去了
We did run yeshiva

157
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,851
我们当时真是毫无顾忌
We didn't take shit from anyone

158
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,645
对 我真怀念
Yeah, I miss that

159
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,105
怀念犹太学校?
You miss yeshiva?

160
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,107
不 我是怀念
No, I miss

161
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,526
当时的无所顾忌
not taking shit from anyone

162
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,414
哟!
Yo!

163
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,668
他不在家你是来买大麻的吗?
He out You looking for weed?

164
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,212
不一定 你有好货吗?
Depends You got good shit?

165
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,341
这么说吧 他的货都是从我这里拿的
Put it this way I sell him his shit

166
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,637
那家伙怎么了?
What's up with this nigga, man?

167
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,263
那好 1盎司的货有吗?
Cool Can you do an ounce?

168
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,766
有 绝对足称 一共300
Yeah, no sweat Three bills

169
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,185
300 挺便宜啊
Three hundred I like it

170
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,729
你如果直接找批发商拿货更便宜
You get the better price
when you come direct to the distributor

171
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,356
我想也是
I guess so

172
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,691
好的
All right

173
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,402
所以 她最后还是把门打开了
Yeah, so, she opened the door

174
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,279
我就说,"哟 奇尔 我不想再这样下去了"
And I'm like, "Yo Chill
I ain't about that drama"

175
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,530
你知道我想说什么吗?
You know what I mean?

176
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,865
"我知道你床上还有另外一个男人"
"I know you got
another nigga in the crib"

177
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,200
什么情况?
What's up?

178
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,202
怎么了?
What?

179
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,288
能把货给我了吗?
Can I get the shit?

180
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,790
什么货?
What shit?

181
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,587
我刚拿给你300块钱买大麻
I just gave you $300 for some weed

182
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,216
你们有谁之前见过这个傻叉的吗?
Any of you niggas ever
seen this motherfucker before?

183
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,550
我没见过
I ain't seen shit

184
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,180
伙计 快滚吧
Man, get the fuck out of here

185
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,149
好吧 好吧 我走 - 算你识趣
- All right All right, okay
- Yeah, yeah

186
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,235
这个白人小子真搞笑
<i>This white boy wild</i>

187
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,736
穿个吊带裤
<i>Parachute pants</i>

188
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,488
看着跟杰・雷诺似的
Looking like Jay Leno and shit

189
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,407
搞得跟马上要去教堂一样
Look like he going to church

190
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,041
哟哟 别冲动 别开枪 伙计
Yo, yo, hold up, hold up, man

191
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,501
我去 - 该死!
<i>What the fuck
Shit!</i>

192
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,882
别跑啊!你们这是去哪儿?
Come on! Where's everybody going?

193
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,926
不是要跟我玩儿吗
I thought we were gonna hang out

194
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,515
真是一群混蛋
What a bunch of assholes

195
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,475
刚刚是什么情况?你疯了?
What the fuck was that? Are you crazy?

196
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,643
没关系 伙计
It's cool, bro

197
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,438
我有3级枪支许可证
I have a Class 3 Firearms license

198
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,523
什么? - 快上车
- Huh?
- Come on, get in

199
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,358
这附近还有个有货的
I know another dealer nearby

200
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,281
真是奇怪 虽然我们年纪相仿 但我总是很崇拜埃佛隆
<i>It's weird We were the same age,
but I always looked up to Efraim</i>

201
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,701
当生活给我一记耳光 我就忍着
<i>When life kicked me, I stayed down</i>

202
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,080
但埃佛隆不同 他会打回去
<i>But not Efraim He kicked back</i>

203
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,124
总统先生 我们想感谢您
<i>Mr President, we want to thank you</i>

204
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,709
今天愿意过来加入我们
<i>for visiting us here today</i>

205
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,211
能够为自己的国家效力 我们倍感荣幸
<i>We are honored to be serving our country,</i>

206
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,046
接下来热烈欢迎
<i>and proud to welcome you,</i>

207
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,424
我们的战时总司令
<i>our wartime Commander in Chief</i>

208
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,761
亲爱的
- Hey
- Hey, sweetie

209
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,597
葬礼举行得怎么样?
How was the funeral?

210
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,640
非常棒
It was amazing

211
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,688
天啊 你吸毒了 对吗?
Oh, my God You're so stoned, aren't you?

212
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,440
什么?
- Huh? What?

213
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,234
你刚刚用"很棒"形容一场葬礼
You just described a funeral as "amazing"

214
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,737
什么?不 葬礼真的很让人感伤
What? No The funeral was really sad

215
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,864
所有人都非常伤心
Yeah, everyone was totally bummed out

216
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,408
但是我竟然碰到了我的发小
But I ran into my friend from growing up

217
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,827
我之前跟你提起过埃佛隆・迪乌利 还记得吗?
The guy I told you about Efraim Diveroli?

218
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,622
就是那个害你被捕的人?
The one you got arrested with?

219
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,334
没错 但我们也不只是干这些事
Yeah I mean, we did
some other stuff too, but

220
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,711
总之 他刚搬回了迈阿密
Anyway, he just moved back to Miami

221
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,296
那很棒啊 不是吗?
That's great, right?

222
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,007
是的 我明天要去趟他的办公室
Yeah I'm supposed
to swing by his office tomorrow

223
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,759
我们说好一起吃顿午饭
We're gonna grab lunch

224
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,303
好的 - 你饿了吗?
- Okay
- Are you hungry?

225
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,763
什么? - 我快饿死了
- Hmm?
- I'm so hungry

226
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,641
家里没什么吃的 - 噢
- We don't have much here
- Oh

227
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,019
但是有披萨 - 真的吗?
- I mean, we have pizza
- Really?

228
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,938
还有玉米片 - 家里居然有玉米片?
- And nachos
- We have nachos?

229
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,731
还有冰淇淋
And ice cream

230
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,192
等等你说什么?家里从来不买冰淇淋的
Wait, what? We never have ice cream

231
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,029
你在寻我开心是不是?
You're fucking with me, aren't you?

232
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,907
真是太坏了
- That is so mean

233
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,244
你真好骗
That was so easy

234
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,125
哪位?
<i>Hello?</i>

235
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,962
你好 布斯丁先生 我是戴维・佩豪斯
Hello, Mr Borstein
This is David Packouz

236
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,672
你之前叫我11点给你打电话
You told me to call today at 11:00

237
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,509
那些床单现在都在我车上
I have those bed sheets with me,
and I would love for you to take a look

238
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,264
额 先生 如果你给我一个机会
Uh, sir, if you give me the chance

239
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,349
我敢保证养老院里的老人们
I am confident that your residents

240
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,976
一定会非常喜欢这个新床单的
will appreciate the difference

241
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,938
这笔开销并不在我们的预算范围内 所以我们不感兴趣
<i>It's an expense we can't justify,
and we're just not interested</i>

242
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,356
好吧
Uh-huh

243
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,775
抱歉占用你宝贵的时间
Okay, well, thank you for your time

244
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
没错 我是来自陆军司令部
<i>Yeah, this is contract specialist</i>

245
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,792
皮卡丁尼的林德赛・麦克
<i>Lindsey Michaels
from Army Command, Picatinny</i>

246
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,549
没错
<i>That's right</i>

247
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,886
我之前有请求支援一些249式突击枪送往巴士拉
Yeah, I sent out a solicitation
for some 249s for Basra

248
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,430
但好像我们把你们下达的文件弄丢了
and we seem to have
misplaced your paperwork

249
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,643
太好了 所以麻烦你尽快把那些编号重新用邮件发给我
Great So if you can go ahead
and just re-email me those numbers

250
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,021
这样吧 我又想了一下
<i>Actually, you know what?
On second thought,</i>

251
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,898
我们必须马上对那些建议请求书进行选择
we're about to make
a decision on those RFPs

252
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,858
所以既然现在我们正好在通话
Why don't you go ahead
and just give me your bid

253
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,360
你为什么不直接把你的出价告诉我呢?
while I got you here on the phone?

254
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,446
好的
Uh-huh

255
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,239
其中包括弹匣吗?
<i>And does that include mags?</i>

256
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,075
好的 没问题 先生
Great Yes, sir

257
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,203
你继续为我们提供武器 那些坏人就交给我们处理
You keep supplying the guns,
we'll keep killing the bad guys

258
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,289
上帝保佑你
God bless you

259
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,957
真是个傻叉 你好吗 兄弟?
What a fucking tool What's up, bro?

260
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,376
你好 伙计 你刚刚在干什么?
Yo, what's up, man?
What was that all about?

261
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,670
我刚刚在假扮军方人员
Oh, that was me
impersonating an army officer

262
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,672
真的?为什么?
Really? What for?

263
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,050
看看我的竞争者们为这份合同怎么出价
To find out what my competitor's
bidding on a contract

264
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,052
我脑子好使着呢
It's fucking genius

265
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,428
你不是说你只是在网上
I thought that you said you sold,

266
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,680
卖查封的武器给那些手枪爱好者吗
like, seized weapons
to gun nuts on the Internet

267
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,015
现在不是了
Not anymore

268
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,975
现在我只跟一个人做生意
Now I only sell to one gun nut

269
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,518
是吗?是谁?
Oh, yeah? Which one?

270
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,480
牛逼轰轰的美国军队
The US Military, motherfucker

271
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,984
想爽一发吗?
Wanna do a bong hit?

272
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,583
爽吧?
Pretty sick, huh?

273
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,211
所以你现在是卖枪给国防部了?
So what, you sell these things
to the Pentagon?

274
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,755
不仅仅是枪 各种东西我都卖
I sell all kinds of shit to the Pentagon

275
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,716
枪啊 子弹啊 防弹衣什么的
Guns, bullets, body armor

276
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:11,346
上个星期我卖了400套
Last week, I shipped 400 gas masks
to American Special Forces in Iraq

277
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,889
不是吧
No shit

278
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,518
你干这一行多久了?
<i>How long you been doing this for?</i>

279
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,228
两三个月吧
Two, three months

280
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,397
很赚钱吗?
<i>And you make good money?</i>

281
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,732
噢!伙计
Oh! Fuck, man

282
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,735
这么说吧仅仅过去8周我就赚了20多万了
Put it this way
I did over 200K in the past eight weeks

283
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,155
我之所以告诉你 是因为你是我兄弟
And I'm only telling you that
because you're my boy

284
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,490
我不是在吹牛
I'm not bragging

285
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,076
我操
Holy shit

286
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,703
来看看这个
<i>Yeah Check this out</i>

287
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,457
这个网站是联邦商业机遇网
Fed Biz Opps stands for
Federal Business Opportunities

288
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,751
好比是易贝网 但专卖战争用品
Think eBay, but for war

289
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,921
坦克也能在上面卖? - 伙计 这上面什么都买得到
- They buy tanks on here?
- Bro, they buy everything on here

290
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,506
真是太疯狂了
<i>It was crazy</i>

291
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,800
政府有一个公开的网站
<i>The government had a public website</i>

292
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,429
这上面包含了最近正在投标的每一条军方合同
<i>containing every military contract
currently up for bidding</i>

293
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,140
我总是直接跳过大单子 去寻找那些
But I skip the big ticket items,
and look for the small-ball shit

294
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,600
国防承包商大头不要的小生意
that giant defense contractors ignore

295
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,103
所以人都在争抢同一块派
Everybody's fighting over the same pie

296
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,855
而他们很容易忽视掉旁边的面包屑
But they're ignoring the crumbs

297
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,482
而我就像老鼠一样 专挑这些面包屑下手
I live on crumbs, like a rat

298
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,319
而当这块派就是五角大楼时
And when you're dealing with the Pentagon,
crumbs are worth millions

299
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,322
这样的买卖似乎是从不间断的
<i>These listings
seemed to go on forever</i>

300
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,242
据埃佛隆所言 事实也确实是这样的
<i>And according to Efraim, they did</i>

301
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,413
谢谢你 伙计
- Thanks, man

302
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,248
但是我不明白
So, I don't get it

303
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,083
明明就有一个很完善的国防市场
If there's an entire defense industry,

304
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,128
为什么国防部会愿意在你们这里买东西?
why would the Pentagon
want to buy anything from you?

305
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,922
不是愿不愿意的问题 是他们必须这么做
They don't want to, they have to

306
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,507
还记得少年棒球联合会吗?
Remember Little League?

307
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,594
在赛季末的时候 他们总会颁发一座最有价值球员奖
How, at the end of the season,
they'd give out that big MVP trophy

308
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,179
而有一个小孩总是赢?
and that one kid would always win it?

309
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,638
记得 伊万・塔尔沃特
Yeah, Evan Talbot

310
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,266
没错 但在这之后的某一年有人的妈妈开始抱怨了 记得吗?
Right But then, one year,
somebody's mom complained?

311
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,811
所以他们开始给每个人都颁发一座小奖杯 借此安慰他们?
Then they had to give everybody
a little trophy so they wouldn't feel bad?

312
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,814
就连那个又肥又傻的小孩罗比・弗里德曼都有一个
Even that fat retarded kid,
Robbie Friedman, got one

313
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,983
这就跟现在的情况很像
That's kind of like what's happening here

314
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,277
我还是搞不懂 伙计
I'm still confused, man

315
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,655
国防部在重建伊拉克军队的时候碰到了大麻烦
The Pentagon fucked up
when they were rebuilding the Iraqi Army

316
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:56,993
他们把所有空标合同 都集中给切尼兄弟 但他们后来被抓
They gave all these no-bid contracts
to Cheney's boys, and they got caught

317
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,662
所以在这之后 布什发起了这种平等竞争的倡议
So Bush started this initiative
to level the playing field

318
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,333
让五角大楼的每一笔花销 每一支枪 每一个炸弹
and now every Pentagon purchase,
every gun, every grenade,

319
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,253
每一发子弹都能由小供货商进行投标 进而供货
every bullet, gets offered to
small businesses for bidding

320
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,340
当然大单子仍然由那些大供货商垄断
And sure, the big dogs
still get the big trophies

321
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,842
但国防部同时也会准备一些小的奖杯
But the Pentagon's
got to give little trophies

322
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,470
安慰全世界的罗比・弗里德曼
to all the Robbie Friedmans of the world

323
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,722
也就是说你就是那个又肥又傻的小屁孩
So, basically, you're a fat retarded kid

324
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,558
兄弟 我是最肥也是最智障的那个
Bro, I'm the fattest and most retarded

325
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,396
根据今天的演讲
<i>In a speech today,</i>

326
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,565
布什总统否定了之前的报道
<i>President Bush said that
contrary to reports</i>

327
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,693
说他并没有打算进攻伊拉克
<i>he has no plans to attack Iran</i>

328
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,570
总统说,"真是可笑"
<i>The President said, "That's ridiculous</i>

329
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,073
"我们在进攻伊拉克的时候根本连计划都没有"
<i>"We didn't even have plans
when we attacked Iraq"</i>

330
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,159
戴维
David

331
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,536
怎么了?
Yeah?

332
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:45,875
还记得几周前 从我妈家回来时 我们在车上干的事吗?
Remember a few weeks ago, in the car
on the way home from my mom's house?

333
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,378
恩 我记得
Yes Yes, I do

334
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,465
我怀孕了
Well, this happened

335
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,146
你他妈怎么养得起小孩?
How the fuck
are you going to feed a baby?

336
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,149
你考虑过这个问题吗?
Have you even thought about this?

337
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,358
你打算怎么办?
What are you going to do?

338
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,068
余生都用来给别的男人打手枪?
Jerk men off the rest of your life?

339
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,822
这也是个方法 我就是要给别人打手枪赚钱来养活我孩子
Yeah, that's the plan
I'm gonna feed my kid by jerking men off

340
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,574
抱歉
Sorry

341
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,701
好的 也行啊 至少是你自己的想法
Okay, good Well, at least
you thought it through

342
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,452
这一点都不好笑
It's not funny

343
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,581
伙计我死定了
Dude, lam so fucked

344
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,919
我觉得你应该过来跟着我干
I think you should come work for me

345
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,880
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

346
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,007
我是认真的 我需要助手
Seriously, I need the help

347
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,301
戴维 看着我
David, look at me

348
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,180
布什准备在伊拉克发起战争
Bush opened the floodgates in Iraq

349
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,183
这他妈绝对是赚钱的好机会
It's a fucking gold rush

350
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,143
你能邀请我 我很感谢埃佛隆
That's really nice of you, Efraim

351
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,187
感谢个屁!谁他妈在乎?
Fuck nice! Who cares about nice?

352
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,355
我一直想找个人跟我一起干
I've been looking to bring
somebody on for a while now

353
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,025
但问题是 我谁也信不过
The problem is, I don't trust anyone

354
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,527
但你是我兄弟
But you're my boy

355
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,115
恕我直言 我很反对战争
I mean, no offense,
but I'm against this war

356
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,036
我和伊兹都打算去签署请愿书
Me and Iz are going to rallies
and signing petitions

357
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,871
我知道 伙计我也很反对战争
Yeah, dude, I'm against the war too

358
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,581
我他妈恨死布什了
I fucking hate Bush

359
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,210
但这么做绝对不代表支持战争
But this isn't about being pro-war

360
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,420
战争已经发生了
The war is happening

361
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,672
这么做是为了赚钱
This is about being pro-money

362
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,759
埃佛隆说的越多 我越觉得有道理
<i>The more Efraim talked,
the more it made sense</i>

363
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,928
而且跟我其他的生路相比
<i>Besides, compared to my other prospects,</i>

364
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,472
这次机会绝对不可错失
<i>this was the chance of a lifetime</i>

365
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,267
唯一的问题就是 我该怎么跟伊兹说?
<i>My only issue was, what would I tell Iz?</i>

366
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,561
我觉得这主意棒极了
I think it's a great idea

367
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,563
所以我选择了撒谎
<i>So I lied</i>

368
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,524
你是知道的 我一直很看好这类生意
You know I've always
believed in this business

369
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,736
我告诉她 埃佛隆在政府很有人脉
<i>I told her that Efraim
had great contacts in the government</i>

370
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,488
所以比起把床单卖给
<i>And instead of selling bed sheets</i>

371
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,782
分厘必争的养老院
<i>to penny-pinching retirement homes</i>

372
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,493
把它们卖给财大气粗资金充裕的美国军队
<i>we'd now be selling sheets
to the free-spending,</i>

373
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,745
这看起来是笔好买卖
<i>overfunded US Military</i>

374
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,538
真有头脑
It's genius

375
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,754
我必须对她说谎 伊兹恨死战争了
<i>I had to lie Iz hated the war</i>

376
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,966
她有两个堂兄 就在伊拉克服役
<i>She had two cousins serving in Iraq</i>

377
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,513
她也非常不喜欢占了我们公寓一半、堆积如山的床单
<i>She also hated the mountain of bed sheets
that were taking up half our apartment</i>

378
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,190
之后的6个星期 我接受了军火买卖的速成课
<i>I spent the next six weeks
in a crash course on arms dealing</i>

379
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,317
这是赫斯塔尔556式轻机枪
The Herstal 556 light machine gun

380
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,736
原制造于比利时 但现在很多地方都可以生产
Belgian, but made under license
in lots of places

381
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,739
当涉及到武器的问题 埃佛隆就什么都知道
<i>When it came to this shit,
Efraim knew everything</i>

382
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,076
品质 模型 重量 产地
<i>Makes, models, weights, where it was made</i>

383
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,954
记住在中国的天安门广场 有武器禁运令
Remember, there's been an arms embargo
against China since Tiananmen Square

384
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,706
如果有避开这些风险的方法
<i>And if there was
an angle to be played,</i>

385
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,082
他也知道
<i>he knew about that too</i>

386
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,376
处理武器问题时 你要学会智取
You have to read between
the lines with this stuff

387
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,170
要学会发现机遇 才能赚钱
All the money is made between the lines

388
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,299
我会花一整天的时间翻阅政府网站
<i>I'd spend my entire day
scouring the government's website,</i>

389
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,177
寻找那些被忽视的合同 然后想办法掺一脚
<i>searching for overlooked contracts
that we could squeeze our way into</i>

390
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,555
嘿 我有发现
Hey, I think I got something

391
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,765
嘿 乔治亚 我一会儿再打给你
Hey, Georgia, I gotta call you back

392
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,392
然后到半夜的时候
<i>And then,
in the middle of the night</i>

393
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,853
我们会回到办公室不停地打电话
<i>we'd be back in the office,
working the phones</i>

394
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,354
跟整个东欧的
<i>Forging relationships</i>

395
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,941
武器制造商打好关系
<i>with weapon manufacturers
all over Eastern Europe</i>

396
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,777
不 我是来自AEY的戴维・佩豪斯
No, David Packouz from AEY

397
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,866
我告诉伊兹 我们在跟巴基斯坦的床单供货商电话会议
<i>I told Iz we were doing conference calls
with sheet suppliers in Pakistan</i>

398
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,245
我们这类人被别人称作军火贩
<i>They called guys like us war dogs</i>

399
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,664
就是那种靠战争吃饭的可鄙之人
<i>Bottom feeders who make money off of war</i>

400
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,083
因为我们从来不用自己上战场
<i>without ever stepping foot
on the battlefield</i>

401
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,171
虽然这个词挺贬义的 但我们很喜欢
<i>It was meant to be derogatory,
but we kinda liked it</i>

402
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,132
你他妈个死人渣!
You fucking scumbag piece of shit!

403
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,469
去死吧 混蛋 下地狱去吧!
Drown, motherfucker, drown!

404
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,059
非常好
Very nice

405
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,687
拉尔夫・斯卢茨基是埃佛隆的秘密合伙人
<i>Ralph Slutsky
was Efraim's silent partner</i>

406
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,565
他是本地的一个商人
<i>He was a local businessman</i>

407
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,818
在迈阿密拥有14个干洗店
<i>who owned 14 dry cleaners
all across Miami</i>

408
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,905
为什么没人告诉我机器坏了?
Why didn't anybody tell me
the mister is broken?

409
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,910
拉夫尔投钱资助买卖 但要求25%公司股权作为交换
<i>Ralph put up the money to back the deals
in exchange for 25% of the company</i>

410
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,331
但只是他自己以为有25%
<i>Or at least what he thought was 25%</i>

411
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,792
我们现在做的事是神圣的拉夫尔
We're doing God's work, Ralph

412
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,794
确实
We really are

413
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,046
每个犹太人对以色列都是有所亏欠的
You know, every Jew owes a debt to Israel

414
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,840
在我看来 这种亏欠不能仅靠口头上弥补
In my mind, this is not
a metaphorical debt

415
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,092
拉夫尔被蒙在鼓里
<i>Ralph was under the impression</i>

416
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,219
他一直以为埃佛隆是一个心思缜密的犹太人
<i>that Efraim was an observant Jew</i>

417
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,845
他买卖军火的目的
<i>who only dealt arms as a means</i>

418
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,972
是出于保护以色列免受敌国的侵蚀
<i>to protect Israel from her enemies</i>

419
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,808
说得太棒了
Beautifully said

420
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,435
你有看上个星期五的《妥拉读经》吗?
Did you happen to catch
last Friday's Torah portion?

421
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,271
那是我最爱看的节目 - 我也是
- One of my favorites
- Same here

422
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,066
那次节目让我想起我之前读到过的一个故事
It reminds me so much
of this story I once read

423
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,944
是关于一个旅游到平斯克的男孩的
About a young man traveling to Pinsk

424
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,655
这就是埃佛隆的天才之处
<i>And that was Efraim's genius</i>

425
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:29,200
他总能从别人身上打探到那个人愿意和哪种人打交道
<i>He would figure out
who someone wanted him to be</i>

426
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,286
然后自己就扮演那个人的角色
<i>and he would become that person</i>

427
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,624
啊!
Ah!

428
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,423
他手下有将近两万人
And he's got, like, 20,000 of them

429
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,299
太好了 你是怎么联系上他的?
Great
Where did you find this guy?

430
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,552
你还记得乌克兰的维克托吗?
You remember Victor in the Ukraine?

431
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,053
记得就是那个买Mk3的家伙?
Yeah, the one with the Mk3s?

432
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,181
没错 他把我介绍给了一家塞浦路斯的公司
Yeah He turned me
on to this company in Cyprus

433
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,809
那个公司的老板是亨利・吉拉尔
It's run by this guy, Henry Girard

434
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,060
亨利・吉拉尔?
Henry Girard?

435
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,438
是的 你认识他?
Yeah, you know him?

436
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,731
你跟亨利・吉拉尔通过话?
You spoke to Henry Girard?

437
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,151
是通过几次怎么了?他是谁?
A couple of times Why? Who is he?

438
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,863
伙计 在过去20年里哪里有战争哪里就有他
Dude, for the last 20 years,
this guy has basically supplied

439
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,449
并且交战双方的武器他都供应
both sides of every conflict
on the planet

440
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,159
他就是个疯子
He's a fucking animal

441
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,036
真的吗?那他为什么给我打电话?
Really? Why is he calling me?

442
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,122
因为他是个疯子
Because he's a fucking animal

443
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,167
小钱大钱都是钱都要赚
It's all money and it all matters

444
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,127
嘿 美女 你要去哪儿?
Hey, <i>mami,</i> where are you going?

445
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,379
找我朋友
I'm trying to find my friends

446
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,881
你想赚点外快吗?
You want to make some money?

447
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,257
你说什么?
Excuse me?

448
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,843
我可以现在就给你1千块
I'll give you $1,000 right now

449
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,928
但我们得直接跳到第3次约会阶段
if we fast forward to our third date

450
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,680
这是什么意思?
What does that even mean?

451
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,225
就是说我们刚刚吃完烛光晚餐
It means we just had a great dinner,
maybe met your friends for some drinks

452
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,227
现在你要和我上车在车上帮我口
and now you're about to blow me in my car

453
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,812
我们能直接跳到这一部分吗?
Can we just get right to that part?

454
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,439
你他妈是谁啊?
Who the fuck are you?

455
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,982
埃佛隆・迪乌利
Efraim Diveroli

456
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,275
那是我最好的朋友戴维
That's my best friend, David

457
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,068
我们是国际军火商
And we're international arms dealers

458
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,403
但这些你应该都知道了
But you already know that

459
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,405
因为这是我们的第3次约会
because we're on our third date

460
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,116
怎么回事? - 没什么伙计
- What's going on?
- Nothing, bro

461
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,951
我正想和我的马子一起离开这里
I'm about to get out of here with my girl

462
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,663
搞什么鬼!
What the fuck, man!

463
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,342
我的天啊
Oh, my God

464
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,345
那个家伙居然动真格的
That guy was not fucking around

465
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,724
是啊 你应该换个马子钓的
Yeah, you probably should have
picked a different girl

466
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,519
胡说 我都快成功了
Fuck that, it almost worked

467
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,440
嘿 你还记得6年级 你和埃里克莫斯考维茨打架那次吗?
Hey, do you remember when you fought
Eric Moscowitz in sixth grade?

468
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,027
记得他当时使出了他的"旋风手臂"
Yeah, he did that windmill thing
with his arms

469
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,196
这就是最诺牡胤 你根本就打不到他
That was the sickest He was unbeatable

470
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,864
你还记得这一招吗?
You remember that shit?

471
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,116
就是这样的
That's it

472
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,244
伙计 如果当时你不来帮我 我就死定了
Dude, he would have killed me
if you didn't jump in

473
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,538
也许吧
Probably Mmm

474
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,668
嘿 我从没说过"谢谢"
Hey, I never said "thank you"

475
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,920
你为我做的所有事
For everything

476
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,130
你也知道最近你帮了我多大的忙
Come on, you know how much
you've helped me out lately

477
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,592
没关系 不要把气氛搞得这么尴尬好吗?
It's cool You don't have to
make it weird, all right?

478
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,137
嘿 我们能点餐了吗?
Hey, can we order some food?

479
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,474
小姐 快点 这等的时间都够我去趟古巴
<i>Mami,</i> come on
I could have gone to Cuba and back

480
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,560
和家人见面再吃几块三明治
Met the family,
grabbed a couple sandwiches

481
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:01,894
再回来的了
- I'd be done by now

482
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,271
哪位?
Hello?

483
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,317
是的 先生 抱歉 没想到这么晚还能接到您的电话
Yes, sir Sorry, I wasn't expecting
a work call this late

484
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,070
当然没问题 现在是巴格达早上9点
Right, of course
It's 9:00 am in Baghdad

485
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,738
是谁?
Who is it?

486
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,116
这真是个好消息 桑托斯上尉
That's great news, Captain Santos

487
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,536
好的 先生
Yes, sir

488
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,954
我们马上发货
We're going to get right on that

489
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,247
谢谢 再见
Thank you Bye

490
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,456
怎么了?
What?

491
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,335
贝雷塔那一单被我们拿下了
We just got the Beretta deal

492
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:27,753
别开玩笑了
Get the fuck out of here

493
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,297
我发誓是真的
I swear to God

494
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,340
贝雷塔单子的数额非常巨大
<i>The Beretta deal was massive</i>

495
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,344
是我们之前接过的单子的10倍
<i>It was 10 times bigger
than anything we'd closed so far</i>

496
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,555
我们的生意终于有进展了
<i>This was next level shit</i>

497
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,390
这就是我所设想的那样!
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

498
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,976
赚大钱该死!操!
That's real money, motherfucker! Fuck!

499
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,353
你有意识到做完这笔
Do you realize we're going to make 600K

500
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,896
我们就能赚60万吗?
on this fucking thing?

501
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,106
天啊
Holy shit

502
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:51,068
戴维 你的30%算下来就是18万
David, your 30% is $180,000

503
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,404
我的苍天老天爷啊!
Holy fucking shit!

504
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,115
那感觉真是太棒了
<i>It was amazing</i>

505
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,867
我只为埃佛隆工作了两个月
<i>I'd been working with Efraim
for two months</i>

506
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,161
赚的钱就比我按一辈子按摩
<i>and was already about to make more money</i>

507
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,121
赚的还要多
<i>than a lifetime of massages</i>

508
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,885
*坦白从来就没有什么好结果*

509
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,885
快听
Listen

510
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,181
那是什么声音?
What is that?

511
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,849
你宝宝的心跳声
- That's your baby's heartbeat

512
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:23,809
哇
Wow

513
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,229
跳得多快啊 你能相信吗?
<i>Can you believe how fast it is?</i>

514
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,316
是正常的吗? - 完全正常
- Is that normal?
- Totally normal

515
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,486
胎儿的心跳频率比我们的要快很多
Fetuses have a much faster heart rate
than we do

516
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,406
你看啊
Look

517
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,285
你们想知道宝宝的性别吗?
So, you guys want to know the sex?

518
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,539
我们一直拿不定主意
- We keep going back and forth on it

519
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,085
你觉得呢? - 额
- What do you think?
- Um

520
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,005
是工作的电话我必须得接
This is work I have to take it

521
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,298
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry

522
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,634
我是戴维
This is David

523
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,636
我是巴格达的桑托斯上尉
<i>This is Captain Santos in Baghdad</i>

524
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,013
想确认一下我们买的贝雷塔的送货情况
<i>checking on the delivery
status of my Berettas</i>

525
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,932
上尉 很高兴接到你的电话
Captain, good to hear from you

526
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,267
您的货正在路上 一切正常
Yes, we are on target All good

527
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,977
那就好 我还担心
Great I was worried

528
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,605
这些枪是不是直接从意大利运送出来呢
those guns were coming
direct out of Italy

529
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,899
当然 绝对是直接送出来
Absolutely They are, sir

530
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,069
佩豪斯请你告诉我
Packouz, please tell me

531
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,905
你知道上周意大利人通过的法案
you're aware of the legislation
the Italians passed last week

532
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,783
禁止一切运往伊拉克的武器离港
The one banning
all arms shipments to Iraq

533
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,911
我根本不知道他在讲什么
<i>I had no clue
what he was talking about</i>

534
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,831
但这绝对是个大麻烦
<i>But this was a huge fucking problem</i>

535
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,874
贝雷塔是意大利制手枪
<i>Berettas are an Italian gun</i>

536
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,877
通常都是在意大利制造生产的
<i>Made and manufactured in Italy</i>

537
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,129
额
Uh

538
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,630
我当然知道
Of course

539
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,257
最近3天我的电话就没停过
I am I've been on the phone

540
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,384
我一直在做协调和安排
for the last three days,
making other arrangements

541
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,262
那就好 这就是我想听到的回答
<i>Great
That's what I wanted to hear</i>

542
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,931
伊拉克警察部队就全靠你了
<i>Iraqi police force is depending on you</i>

543
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,350
你告诉他们有AEY在 叫他们放心好了
Well, you tell them AEY
has got them covered

544
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,270
非常好 - 谢谢你上尉 我会再打给你的
<i>- Outstanding</i>
- Thanks, Captain Talk soon

545
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,069
没事吧?
Everything okay?

546
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,489
没事 一切都好
Yeah Yeah, everything's fine

547
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,200
怎么了?已经检查完了?
What happened? We done already?

548
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,078
对 你猜怎么着?
Yeah Guess what?

549
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,874
是个女孩
It's a girl

550
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,130
亲爱的
Baby

551
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,725
好吧 至少我没脱靶
Okay At least I hit something

552
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,852
说真的 我们到底应该怎么办?
Seriously, what the fuck
are we going to do?

553
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,812
放轻松 伙计
Relax, bro

554
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,231
我要不要回电给他 然后告诉他实情?
Should I just call him back
and tell him the truth?

555
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,486
坦白从来就没有什么好结果
When does telling the truth
ever help anybody?

556
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,654
埃佛隆 我们不能一直瞒着他
Efraim, we can't dick around with this guy

557
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,906
到最后货物没到 他还是会发现的
and then not deliver

558
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,575
货一定会到的 我已经想到办法了
We're going to deliver
I already figured it out

559
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:45,826
我们通过约旦运货
We use Jordan

560
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,745
乔丹・戈德法布?
Jordan Goldfarb?

561
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:48,954
约旦
Jordan

562
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,539
那个国家约旦
Jordan the country

563
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,167
它和伊拉克接壤 并且是美国的同盟国
It shares a border with Iraq
It's a US ally

564
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,961
更重要的是那里没有禁运令
And most importantly, there's no embargo

565
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,131
那好 我们该怎么跟意大利人讲?
Okay, so what do we tell the Italians?

566
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,133
管他妈的!这5千支贝雷塔是要送去约旦的
Fuck them! As far as they're concerned

567
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,595
而这个国家的事 他们管不着
they're sending 5,000 Berettas
to a country they have no issue with

568
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,097
我们只需要确保有人能从约旦
All we have to do is ship the guns

569
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,016
把枪运到巴格达就行了
from Jordan to Baghdad

570
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,643
这就叫智取
It's called circumvention

571
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,187
这么做合法吗?
Is that legal?

572
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,481
反正不违法
It's not illegal

573
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,776
要试试吗?
Want to try?

574
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,404
那场慈善晚会办得怎么样?
How did that charity thing go?

575
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,906
是筹集了5千块 对吧?
It was 5K, right?

576
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,741
目标是定的5千
It was supposed to be a 5K

577
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,993
但我只完成了5分之一
Uh, I finished about 1K of it

578
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,246
所以我要把我拿走的那5分之4还回来
So, I should probably return
four-fifths of the money

579
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,833
安德鲁告诉我
<i>So, Andrew told me</i>

580
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,377
你现在在和埃佛隆合作?
you and Efraim are working together now?

581
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:37,878
不是吧?
Really?

582
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,964
没错我告诉她你卖床单的事了
Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing

583
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,633
对 埃佛隆在政府有认识的人
Yeah Efraim has some contacts
with the government

584
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,886
所以我们现在就一起干了
So we're just combining forces right now

585
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,389
好吧 只是在他身边你要小心点
Yeah, just Just be careful with him

586
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,558
艾米丽别说了 - 怎么了?
- Emily, don't
- What?

587
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,017
此话怎讲?
How do you mean?

588
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,895
他的表妹丽贝卡是我的一个老朋友
Well, his cousin, Rebecca,
is an old friend of mine

589
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,438
我们以前经常一起去野营
We went to camp together

590
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,984
她告诉我他从她爸爸那儿偷走了7万块钱
And she told me
that he stole $70,000 from her father

591
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,735
哇 真的吗?
<i>Whoa, really?</i>

592
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:02,945
这就有意思了
That's interesting

593
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,738
我听到的故事版本和这个恰巧相反
I actually heard
it was the other way around

594
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,575
偷钱的人应该是他叔叔 他才是受害者
That his uncle is the one
who stole the money from him

595
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,034
看吧 你就是不听我的
See? You don't know

596
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,578
每个人都有不同的故事版本
<i>Everyone has their own version of a story</i>

597
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,329
不 我非常确信
No, I'm pretty certain

598
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,415
因为这件事 她家里的所有人都不理他了
Their whole family
stopped talking to him over it

599
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,459
哟!你为什么不接电话?
Yo! Why aren't you answering your phone?

600
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,295
嘿 你好吗 伙计?
Hey, what's up, man?

601
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,172
这什么情况?
Fuck is this?

602
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,467
大家 这位就是戴维的生意伙伴 埃佛隆
Everyone, this is David's
business partner, Efraim

603
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,845
嘿 兄弟 - 嘿 兄弟
- Hey, man
- Hey, man

604
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,680
伙计 你能到外面来几分钟吗 我有话有跟你讲?
Bro, could I talk to you
outside for a minute?

605
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,390
挺急的 - 当然
- It's urgent
- Yeah, of course

606
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,435
提醒你们一下 我也是他最要好的朋友
And for the record,
I'm also his best friend,

607
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,146
所以你们有什么活动最好也叫上我
so probably should have been
invited to whatever this is

608
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,444
听着 这些都是她的朋友 这也是她举办的晚宴
Look, these are her friends
This is her dinner party

609
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,779
罗斯什么时候成她朋友了?那个犹太佬?
Rosen is her friend now? That Jew fuck?

610
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,239
相信我 你不会想参加的
Trust me, you don't want to be here

611
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,741
就连我都待不下去了 知道吗?
I don't want to be here, all right?

612
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,534
有什么事吗?
Now, what's going on?

613
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,453
约旦的海关把我们的贝雷塔扣下了
Jordanian customs seized our Berettas

614
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,955
什么?怎么了? - 我他妈不知道戴维
- What? Why?
- I don't fucking know, David

615
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,165
我是在他们改变
I dropped out of high school

616
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,083
外交政策以前从高中辍学的
before they covered
international diplomacy

617
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,754
谁打来的? - 该死是桑托斯
- Who's that?
- Fuck, it's Santos

618
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,005
他全都知道了!
He knows!

619
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,008
快接电话 我要听
Pick it up, I want to listen

620
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,636
把把电话接起来 - 我是戴维
- Pick Pick up the fucking phone
- This is David

621
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,180
我听说我的枪被扣在约旦了
<i>Yeah, I just heard
my guns are being held up in Jordan</i>

622
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,350
桑托斯上尉 没错 现在是出了点小小的意外
Captain Santos, yes,
there's been a slight hiccup

623
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,893
它们怎么跑到约旦去了?
What are they even doing in Jordan?

624
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,102
这你不用担心
<i>Not to worry</i>

625
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,688
它们现在在安曼的一个中转站里 非常安全
They're in a hangar in Amman
Totally safe

626
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,566
我和我的团队正在想办法解决这个问题
My team and I are working
on a solution right now

627
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,276
你没有回答我的问题
<i>You didn't answer my question</i>

628
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,278
我的枪怎么跑到约旦去了?
<i>What the fuck are my guns doing in Jordan?</i>

629
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,239
桑托斯上尉 我是埃佛隆・迪乌利
Captain Santos, this is Efraim Diveroli

630
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,075
是AEY的董事
President of AEY, sir

631
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,576
戴维 把现在的情况
David has apprised me of the situation

632
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,286
都告诉我了 我希望我们能讨论出一个备选方案
and we are looking at options as we speak

633
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,704
备选方案?什么备选方案?
<i>Options? What kind of options?</i>

634
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,874
你知道乌鸦TP19式手枪吗?
Well, are you familiar
with the Corvus TP19?

635
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,043
巴西造的破铜烂铁
<i>That's Brazilian and it's shit</i>

636
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,462
合同上写的是贝雷塔 我就要贝雷塔
<i>Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas</i>

637
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,756
长官 我希望你能理解我们一下
Sir, I need you to work
with us a little on this

638
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:46,966
我就直说了吧
<i>Let me get this straight</i>

639
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:50,469
我现在身处世界上最艰难的环境 为了你们的自由拼死拼活
I'm in the ass crack of the world,
defending your freedom

640
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,596
还要我理解你们?
And I got to work with you shit bags?

641
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,056
听着 我不知道
<i>Look, I don't know</i>

642
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,558
那些贝雷塔现在是否在安曼
<i>if those Berettas are really in Amman</i>

643
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,143
或者你们只是想尽全力保住自己从中获利
or if you're just trying
to goose your profits

644
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:01,563
就跟干你们这行的都是些可悲丑陋的人
like every other piece of shit
in your miserable, rat-fuck profession

645
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,358
不管如何 你们都已经影响到我本次任务
Either way, you're endangering my mission

646
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,609
我要取消和你们的合作
I'm shutting you down

647
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,486
我要封杀你们
<i>I'm canceling you for cause</i>

648
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,240
封杀就好比给我们判了死刑
<i>Getting canceled for cause
was a death sentence</i>

649
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,034
那意味着我们别想再赢得任何一个合同
<i>It meant we would never
win another contract</i>

650
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,748
上尉 求你别这样做
Captain, please do not do that

651
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,709
我知道你现在很生气
I know you're upset

652
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,836
但看在大家都是信徒的份上
But from one Christian to another

653
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:30,134
我妻子和我正面临非常严峻的经济危机
my wife and I are having
serious financial problems

654
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,345
我们的孩子卢卡斯现在在医院接受治疗
Our son, Lucas, is in the hospital

655
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,764
他的医疗费用已经超出了我们的可承受范围
Medical bills are through the roof

656
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:40,185
如果你这么做 不仅会毁了我还会毁了我整个家庭
If you do this, it'll ruin me
It'll ruin my family

657
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:41,520
我对天发誓
As God as my witness,

658
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,647
一定会把枪给你送去
- I will get you your guns

659
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,857
喂?
Hello?

660
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,776
真他妈是个混蛋!你能忍吗?
What a fucking piece of shit!
Do you believe this fucking guy?

661
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,236
该死 - 你们在说什么?
- Fuck
<i>- What's going on?</i>

662
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,700
什么枪 戴维?
<i>What guns, David?</i>

663
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,455
你他妈是在逗我吗?
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

664
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,207
你不是说你们在卖床单吗
You told me you guys
were selling bed sheets

665
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,210
没错 但我也说了我们还卖其他东西的
Yeah, and I also told you
that we're selling other stuff too

666
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,171
我以为你说的是枕头!
I thought you meant pillows!

667
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,340
听着 光靠按摩 我怎么可能养得起孩子
Look, I can't support a kid
by giving massages

668
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,342
明白吗?而且根本就没人愿意买床单
Okay? And nobody
was buying the bed sheets

669
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,178
不 戴维重点是你骗了我
No, David, you lied to me

670
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,430
因为我知道你对于战争的看法
Because I know how you feel about the war

671
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,557
我以为在这一点上我们是同一战线的!
I thought we both felt that way!

672
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,143
我已经怀孕5个月了!
I'm five months pregnant!

673
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,228
但如果连孩子的爸爸我都不能信任的话
And it's a problem
if I can't trust the man

674
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,521
那问题可就大了!
I'm having a baby with!

675
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,857
你当然可以信任我 - 真的吗?
- Of course you can trust me
- Really?

676
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,067
因为5分钟前
Because five minutes ago,

677
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,818
我连你是个军火商都不知道!
I didn't even know
you were an arms dealer!

678
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,612
我不是什么军火商
I'm not an arms dealer

679
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,322
我们的工作是完全合法的
What we do is perfectly legal

680
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,741
我们只是为政府工作相当于中间人
We work for the government
We're middlemen

681
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,160
我们根本不接触武器 甚至连武器的面都见不到
We don't touch the guns,
we don't see the guns

682
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,621
我们连办公室都没出过
We never even leave the office

683
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,456
嘿 抱歉 打扰一下 现在是特殊时期
Hey, sorry to interrupt
It's time sensitive

684
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,791
戴维 你有护照吗?
David, do you have a passport?

685
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,502
怎么了?我有要干嘛?
What? Yeah, why?

686
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,962
我们要去趟约旦 我是说马上就去
We have to go to Jordan Like, ASAP

687
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,547
把烂摊子收拾干净
<i>Straighten this shit out</i>

688
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,216
等会再聊 好吗?
We gotta talk, whatever, okay?

689
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,592
好吧
Yeah

690
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,053
你要坐靠窗还是走道?
<i>Yo, you window or aisle?</i>

691
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:05,020
不好意思 借过 - 对 我们刚下飞机
- Excuse me, sorry
- Yeah, we just landed

692
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,855
借过 - 大使馆的电话?
Excuse me
The Embassy call?

693
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,733
借过 - 好的 再见
Excuse me Okay, bye

694
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,028
抱歉 我们有急事 - 抱歉 借过
- Sorry, kind of an emergency
- Excuse me Sorry

695
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,947
没事 我插个队 哥是美国人
Don't worry, I have to go first
I'm American

696
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,323
抱歉
I'm sorry

697
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,964
美国大使馆在处理海关的问题上
<i>The American Embassy
offered little to no help</i>

698
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,633
基本提供不了任何的帮助
<i>in dealing with the Ministry of Customs</i>

699
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,885
所以我们决定自己上手
<i>So we took matters into our own hands</i>

700
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,731
他说你们的许可证已经过期了
He says your permit has expired

701
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,401
没有许可证 就不能开飞机把货从约旦运出去
and that you can't fly your crates
out of Jordan without one

702
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,194
这我们知道 所以我们才来找他啊
Yeah, we know That's why we're here

703
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:58,073
听着 我们听说你在政府有认识的人
Look, we were told that
you know people in the government,

704
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,160
或许你能帮帮我们
that maybe you can help us out

705
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,966
他说要想办理一张新的许可证 需要至少6周的时间
He says it will take six weeks
to get a new permit

706
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,010
这就是问题的关键 我们没那么多时间
Yeah, that's the issue
We don't have six weeks

707
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,761
我们今天就要把枪搞到
We need our guns today

708
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,393
听着 我不想一来就扮演一个美国阔佬的角色
Look, I don't want to come off
as the ugly American here

709
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:30,147
我也不清楚在你们的文化里有没有什么礼节
And maybe I don't understand
the rituals of your culture

710
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,690
但我感觉这个点
but this feels like the moment

711
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,859
是我应该有所表示的时候了 我说的没错吧?
where we are supposed to offer
him a gift, am I correct?

712
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,777
没错 - 好吧
- You are correct
- All right

713
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,366
1400美元可以吗?
<i>$1,400 US Cool?</i>

714
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,368
可以
Cool, man

715
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,664
早就应该亮票子了
Could have just started with that,
you know, saved all this bullshit

716
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,874
我挺喜欢你的墨镜的
I like your shades

717
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,751
告诉他 我愿意花100块买下他的墨镜
Tell him I'll give him
100 bucks for those shades

718
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,169
快翻译给他听
Tell him in gibberish

719
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,966
没门 这可是短吻鳄牌的
No way Alligator

720
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,052
我知道
Yeah, I know I

721
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,804
应该是"法国鳄鱼"那个标志是一条鳄鱼
It's Lacoste It's actually a crocodile

722
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,974
我就喜欢浮夸的东西 那个很对我胃口
I like fancy shit, that's my thing

723
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,601
快翻译
Tell him

724
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,065
整整3天时间 一点消息都没有
<i>For three days,
we didn't hear anything</i>

725
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,234
想想也是可笑
<i>It was ridiculous</i>

726
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:19,529
我们的整个生意都要仰仗一个11岁的小翻译
<i>Our entire business was riding on the word
of an 11-year-old translator</i>

727
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,450
混蛋!他欺骗了我们!
Motherfucker! He ripped us off!

728
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,786
现在还不清楚
We don't know that yet

729
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,205
不!我知道糊弄别人是什么感觉
No! I know what it feels like
to fuck somebody

730
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,624
我也知道被人糊弄是什么感觉
I also know what it feels like
to get fucked by somebody

731
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,251
所以我们肯定是被耍了
And we just got fucked

732
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,878
你冷静点
You need to chill out

733
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,713
你要我怎么冷静 戴维?
How am I supposed to chill out, David?

734
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,258
我们现在在一个穆斯林国家 想找个给我口的人都没有!
We're in a Muslim country,
I can't even get a blowjob!

735
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,009
太他妈尴尬了!
It's embarrassing!

736
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,179
这里真是太乱了!操!
It's chaos here! Fuck!

737
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,189
是我
Yeah

738
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:55,983
现在吗?
<i>Right now?</i>

739
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,527
我们马上下来
We're coming down

740
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,279
是阿拉丁打来的 他们现在在大厅
That was Aladdin They're in the lobby

741
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,739
看吧 我们快下去
See that? Come on

742
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,077
等一下 你们不是在逗我吧?
Hold on Are you fucking kidding me?

743
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,328
有什么问题吗?
What's the problem?

744
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,873
你想把枪找回来 他就帮你要回来了呀
You wanted your guns back,
he got you your guns back

745
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,419
什么?不 我们是想搞一张许可证 把东西用飞机运到伊拉克去
What? No, we said we needed a permit
to fly them to Iraq

746
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,089
没错 但是开车送过去就不需要许可证了
Exactly, but you don't need
a permit to drive them

747
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,591
你想让我们带着枪开车去伊拉克?
You expect us to drive them to Iraq?

748
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:26,096
为什么不呢?万宝路是整个约旦最会走私的人
Why not? Marlboro is the best
smuggler in all of Jordan

749
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:27,556
谁 他吗?
Who, this?

750
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,392
他就是整个约旦最利索的走私犯?
This is the best smuggler
in all of Jordan?

751
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,730
是的 他每个月要往返巴格达3、4次呢
Yeah, he drives to Baghdad
three, four times a month

752
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,191
埃佛隆 你想过来说几句吗?
Efraim, you want to weigh in here?

753
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,402
从这里到巴格达有多远?
Yo, how far is it to Baghdad?

754
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:43,447
你为什么问这个? - 800公里
- Why are you asking him that?
-800 kilometers

755
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:44,823
他知道自己在干什么?
And he knows what he's doing?

756
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,450
埃佛隆 别这样
<i>Efraim, stop</i>

757
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,618
绝对没问题 - 走吧
- 100% the best
- Come on

758
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,663
就差不多500英里距离 我们明天一早就能到
It's like 500 miles
We'll be there by morning

759
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:55,375
你真的打算开车去巴格达?
You seriously want to drive to Baghdad?

760
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,337
戴维 我们是搞军火生意的
David, we're gunrunners

761
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,340
真真切切走私一把有什么不好
Let's go run some fucking guns

762
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:02,966
出发吧
Let's go

763
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,761
快啊
<i>Come on</i>

764
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:15,354
嘿 讲真的 这安全吗?开车去巴格达?
Hey, seriously, is this safe?
Driving to Baghdad?

765
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,522
非常安全
Yes, very safe

766
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:18,774
一半一半
50-50

767
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:24,571
一半一半?你是说有50%的机率活下来 50%会死吗?
50-50? What, like 50% we live, 50% we die?

768
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,616
没错 所以我们才会选择走夜路
Yes That is why we drive through night

769
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,826
这样更安全点
It is much safer

770
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,245
能有多安全?
How much safer?

771
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,705
一半一半
50-50

772
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,332
伙计搞什么!
Bro, what the fuck!

773
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,460
很明显他也不知道一半一半是什么意思
Obviously, he doesn't know
what 50-50 means

774
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,087
我的天啊
Oh, my God

775
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:43,131
嘿 汽油怎么办?这路还长着呢?
<i>Hey, what about gas though?
It's a long trip, no?</i>

776
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,468
没问题 伊拉克的汽油都是免费的
No problem Petrol free in Iraq

777
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,178
不是吧
No kidding

778
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:49,930
免费汽油? - 是的
- Free gas?
- Yeah

779
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:53,225
知道我在说什么了吧?伊利卡屑爆了
See what I'm talking about? Iraq is dope

780
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,104
我打算在那里安个家
I'm thinking about getting a place there

781
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:02,065
*伊拉克 310公里*

782
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,065
免费汽油
<i>Free gas</i>

783
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,359
真酷
<i>Fucking cool, man</i>

784
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,008
那是什么?
What is that?

785
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,303
怎么了?
What?

786
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,389
你没看到吗?
You don't see that?

787
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:35,934
什么鬼?
What the fuck?

788
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,769
嘿 你为什么要减速伙计?
Hey, why are you slowing down, man?

789
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:39,312
没关系 别紧张
It's okay, it's okay

一切感觉就像是在做梦
<i>It was fucking surreal</i>

807

<i>Six months ago,
I was a massage therapist in Miami Beach</i>

808
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,326

driving a truckload of guns</i>

小心点
<i>Be careful</i>

826
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:47,102

00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,444
你那里现在是几点?
What time is it there?

<i>Listen, I'm not saying I like it,</i>

837
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,499

真的吗?
You do?

839
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,338
这段时间 我一直没有考虑你的感受
<i>This whole time I never thought
about what you must be going through</i>

840
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,340
还有你所面临的一切压力
<i>All the pressure you're under</i>

841
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,428
唯一让我伤心的是你欺骗了我
<i>It's just the lying that kills me</i>

842
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,431
这让我感觉自己很无助
<i>It makes me feel like I'm in this alone</i>

843
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,561
不 你不是一个人

It's all seized
from the godfather himself

922

你或许会认为在伊拉克死里逃生的经历
<i>You might think
after barely surviving Iraq</i>

931
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:49,857
会让我们点到为止
<i>that we'd be done</i>

932
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:51,859
但你想错了
<i>But you'd be wrong</i>

933
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:58,032
贝雷塔这单生意让我们名声大噪
<i>You see, the Beretta deal
put us on the map</i>

934
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:01,285
在那之后 我们的生意越做越多
<i>After that, we started killing it</i>

935
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,292
我们买了同款的保时捷
<i>We bought matching Porsches</i>

936
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,045
还在同一栋楼里买了两间公寓
<i>We bought two apartments
in the same building</i>

937
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,882
我的天啊
Oh, my God

938
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:23,057
我去伙计
- Holy shit, bro

939
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,228
噢!
Oh!

940
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,105
喔!
Whoo!

941
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,818
拉夫尔对于自己的提成非常满意
<i>Ralph was so happy with his returns</i>

942
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,903
所以他决定将原先的投资
<i>that he increased his original investment</i>

943
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,030
上涨到1千万
<i>in AEY by $10 million</i>

944
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:46,080
这样我们就拥有足够的资本谈下更多笔单子
<i>That gave us enough capital
to pursue more deals</i>

945
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,623
并且扩建我们的公司了
<i>and expand the company</i>

946
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:50,084
我们也正是这么做的
<i>Which is exactly what we did</i>

947
00:52:52,124 --> 00:52:56,084
*这根本不是面包屑 这就是一整块派*

948
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,260
这一点强调多少次都不够
I cannot stress this enough

949
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,805
你们必须仔细翻阅这个网站
You need to be scouring this website

950
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,265
从早到晚
Day and night

951
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,476
每分钟都有更新
It is updated by the minute

952
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:12,481
网站上有数以万计的委托书
There are tens of thousands of
solicitations on this website

953
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,027
每一个委托书有40到50页
<i>Each one is 40 to 50 pages long</i>

954
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,905
如果你发现有意思的东西
If you see something interesting,

955
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,115
马上告知我
you bring it to me

956
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,784
如果你们及时通知了我
If you bring it to me,

957
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,079
我就能让你钱包鼓起来
I'll make you rich

958
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,832
事实上18个月前
Fact, 18 months ago,

959
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,959
那边的戴维还在帮别人打手枪赚钱
David here was jerking off guys for money

960
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,503
这不是事实
- Actually, that is not a fact

961
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:36,214
这就是事实
That is absolutely a fact

962
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,507
但现在他开的是保时捷
Now he drives a Porsche

963
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,093
这一切都归功于AEY
And that's all because of AEY

964
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,388
你们有什么问题吗?
Do you have any questions?

965
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,183
我有问题
Um, I have a question

966
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,228
AEY是什么意思?
What does AEY stand for?

967
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,104
你什么意思?是说它代表什么?
What do you mean? Like morally?

968
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,233
不 我是问它是什么单词的缩写?
No, I mean what do the letters mean?

969
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,318
这真是
That's fucking

970
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,570
那IBM是什么的缩写?什么都不是
What does IBM stand for? Nothing

971
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:01,781
只是这么叫听起来专业一点
It just It just sounds professional

972
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:08,663
事实上IBM指的是国际商用机器公司
Uh, actually, IBM stands for
International Business Machines

973
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,084
你说什么?
What did you say?

974
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:16,629
IBM指的是国际商用机器公司
IBM stands for
International Business Machines

975
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,590
快滚出去
Get the fuck out of here

976
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,678
我是认真的 这里不欢迎你
I'm serious
You're not going to work here

977
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,390
快滚出我的办公室 你个该死的书呆子!
Get the fuck out of my office,
you fucking nerd!

978
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,017
滚!
Go!

979
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,604
再说一遍 AEY不是什么的缩写
And for the record,
AEY doesn't stand for anything

980
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,441
操!真他妈混蛋
- Fuck! What a dick

981
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:47,618
还有人有问题吗?
Does anybody else have any questions?

982
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,503
你睡吧 我去看看
Sleep I got her

983
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,145
好了 好了
All right All right

984
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:17,523
嗨
Hi

985
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,403
我知道
I know

986
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,573
我知道 没事了
I know It's okay

987
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,202
好了
Okay

988
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,342
这是什么?
What?

989
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:57,605
36万支狙击步枪
<i>360,000 SVD sniper rifles</i>

990
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:01,275
1084万个GP-30手榴弹
1,084,000 GP-30 grenades

991
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:04,987
45万枚索克托导弹
45,000 SKO aviation rockets

992
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:09,700
五角大楼打算在接下来的30年里都对准阿富汗进攻
The Pentagon's arming the Afghans
for the next 30 years

993
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:11,827
所以正在集结一整支部队
They're building a whole army

994
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,288
等一下 那应该是打错了吧
<i>Wait, that's got to be a typo</i>

995
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,790
并没有
<i>It's not</i>

996
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,294
1亿发AK-47的子弹?
<i>100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo?</i>

997
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,631
兄弟 这可不是什么面包屑
Bro, these aren't crumbs

998
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:27,134
这可是块大大的完整的派
This is the whole fucking pie

999
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,186
对于国防承包商来讲
<i>Among defense contractors,</i>

1000
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:40,022
这笔单子将会以"阿富汗问题"的名字出现
<i>this would come to be known
as the Afghan deal</i>

1001
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,066
这将是AEY所面临的
<i>It would be the biggest opportunity</i>

1002
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,026
最难能可贵的机会
<i>AEY would ever see</i>

1003
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,239
我们必须拿下它
<i>We had to go for it</i>

1004
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:54,078
所以如果想武装整个国家 你可以去哪儿?
<i>So, where do you go
to arm an entire country?</i>

1005
00:56:54,117 --> 00:56:57,078
*拉斯维加斯 内华达州*

1006
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,878
维加斯是所有军方或者武器制造商
<i>Vegas X is where
military and manufacturers</i>

1007
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:06,132
齐聚一起探讨最近战争问题的聚集地
<i>come together to unveil
the latest in warfare</i>

1008
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,844
就好比主角是手榴弹的动漫大会
<i>It's like Comic-Con with grenades</i>

1009
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:08,132
*2006年拉斯维加斯 国防科技博览会*

1010
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:16,642
当然这里的大部分人都不知道AEY是什么
<i>Sure, most of these guys
didn't know who AEY was</i>

1011
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,812
但我们把这一条视作是我们的优势
<i>But we saw that as an advantage</i>

1012
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,690
清单带了吗? - 带了
- You got your list?
- Got it

1013
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:24,859
感觉如何? - 还不错
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel pretty good

1014
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,153
这跟在电话上谈生意完全是两码事
You know, this is different
than doing business on the phone

1015
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,029
当他们看到我们的时候 第一反应肯定是这明明就是两个小屁孩
When they look at us,
they're going to see two kids

1016
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,364
所以我们一定要摆出自己的姿态
So we have to show them our balls

1017
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:31,532
明白
Got it

1018
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,492
我们得扮演狠角色 明白吗?
We need to be fucking thugs,
you understand?

1019
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:34,702
明白
Understood

1020
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,954
好吧 我们上吧 一定要拿下
All right, good Let's kill this shit

1021
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,336
但事实证明 这简直就是一场灾难
<i>But it was a complete disaster</i>

1022
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,007
很快我们就明白了一点
<i>We quickly learned that</i>

1023
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,050
即使我们能碰巧拿下"阿富汗问题"
<i>even if we could land the Afghan deal,</i>

1024
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,553
但在运筹上仍然是个大问题
<i>it would be a logistical nightmare</i>

1025
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:54,221
杰里 很高兴见到你
Jerry, good to see you

1026
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,348
要想处理这种量级的单子
<i>To source a deal of this magnitude</i>

1027
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,850
那就意味着
<i>would mean piecing together</i>

1028
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,895
要和来自世界各地的不同供货商打交道
<i>multiple vendors
from all around the world</i>

1029
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,438
喔喔
- Whoa, whoa

1030
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,731
不是吧
Get out of here

1031
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,691
也需要动用到数十次运输交通工具
<i>It would require
dozens of shipping outfits</i>

1032
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,234
还有上百张许可证
<i>and hundreds of permits</i>

1033
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:08,903
我们需要1亿发子弹
<i>We need 100 million rounds</i>

1034
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:12,740
这些对于国防承包商大头来讲都不成问题
<i>All that could be okay
for a major defense contractor</i>

1035
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,241
但对于我们来讲
<i>But not for us</i>

1036
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:19,955
老实说我们还不够格
<i>Honestly, we were out of our league</i>

1037
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,649
换1万的筹码
Change $10,000

1038
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,611
今天运气如何?
Any luck today?

1039
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:06,752
埃佛隆!
Efraim!

1040
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:11,799
怎么了兄弟?
What's up, bro?

1041
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,300
你去哪儿了?你为什么不接电话?
Where you been? Why aren't you
answering your phone?

1042
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,760
我叫了妓女 有什么事吗?
I'm with a prostitute What's up?

1043
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,137
你必须现在马上换衣服和我下楼
Okay, you need to get dressed
and come with me right now

1044
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,265
好吧 给我
All right, uh, give me

1045
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:21,600
38分钟
38 minutes

1046
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:25,104
埃佛隆亨利・吉拉尔就在楼下的酒吧等我们
Efraim, Henry Girard is down at the bar,
waiting for us

1047
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:26,855
别闹了
Get the fuck out of here

1048
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,357
我是说真的
I'm dead serious

1049
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:31,819
该死
Shit

1050
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,196
好吧
Okay

1051
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,992
亨利・吉拉尔在军火商里绝对算得上是传奇人物
<i>Henry Girard was a legend
among arms dealers</i>

1052
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:41,662
当萨达姆・侯赛因以反人道罪被判处绞刑时
<i>When they hung Saddam Hussein
for crimes against humanity</i>

1053
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,373
有传言称吊死他的那根绳子就是亨利卖的
<i>it was said that Henry sold them the rope</i>

1054
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,624
嘿 亨利 抱歉我迟到了
Hey, Henry, sorry I'm late

1055
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,167
这位就是我跟你提到的我的合伙人
This is my partner
I was telling you about

1056
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:49,336
埃佛隆・迪乌利 - 很高兴认识你
- Efraim Diveroli
- Nice to meet you

1057
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,171
见到你是我的荣幸
It's an absolute pleasure

1058
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,673
亨利10分钟后就要去用餐了
Henry has a dinner in 10 minutes,

1059
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,341
但我还是想要他亲自跟你讲
but I wanted you to hear this firsthand

1060
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,969
我把清单给他看了 他能帮我们
I showed him the list and he can help

1061
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:59,388
很好 具体是哪一部分的?
Great With which part?

1062
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,681
全部
All of it

1063
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,558
清单上有的 他都能想办法弄到
He can fill the whole order

1064
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,019
所有东西? - 是的
- The whole order?
<i>- Mmm-hmm</i>

1065
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,645
AK子弹也行?
Even the AK ammo?

1066
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:08,522
没问题
Not a problem

1067
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,567
你知道上面写的是1亿发对吧?
You do know it's
100 million rounds, right?

1068
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,694
亨利在阿尔巴尼亚有认识的人
Henry has contacts in Albania

1069
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,362
阿尔巴尼亚?
Albania?

1070
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,365
他们花了几十年时间
They spent decades preparing
for a Western invasion that never came

1071
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:20,367
那个国家就是一个巨大的兵工厂
That country is one giant arsenal

1072
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,536
所有的武器应有尽有
It's all just sitting there

1073
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:23,996
告诉他最激动人心的部分
Tell him the best part

1074
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,206
他们正打算加入北大西洋公约组织
They're in the process of joining NATO,

1075
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:29,585
所以他们必须把苏联时期的武器全部处理掉
so they have to dispose of all
of their Soviet era weapons

1076
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:33,047
也就是把枪支全部拆卸掉分成小部件进行清理
They are literally dismantling it
and turning it into scrap

1077
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,549
我可以花很少的钱把这些零件买回来
I can get most of the shit
for pennies on the dollar

1078
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,551
还有另一个激动人心的部分
Now, tell him the other best part

1079
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:43,057
现在坐在你面前的 就是这笔买卖属于我们独家代理
You're looking at the exclusive agent
for the whole fucking thing

1080
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,100
这简直就跟变魔术一样
<i>This was the magic bullet</i>

1081
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:49,229
一个供货商居然就可以搞定整个"阿富汗问题"
<i>One supplier who could
fill the entire Afghan deal</i>

1082
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:52,733
这不仅给了我们竞争的机会
<i>This wouldn't just put us in contention</i>

1083
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,069
我们甚至很有可能赢得代理权
<i>We might actually win this thing</i>

1084
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,031
抱歉 我有一个问题
Sorry, I have a question

1085
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,407
请讲
Sure

1086
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,201
你既然有这么多关系
With that kind of hookup

1087
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,286
为什么不自己出价自己干呢?
why don't you just bid
on the contract yourself?

1088
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:08,916
要听真话吗?
Full disclosure?

1089
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,755
我被禁止和美国政府进行任何的商业往来
I'm barred from doing any business
with the US government

1090
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,090
我在监控名单上
I'm on a watch list

1091
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,467
恐怖分子监控名单?
Like a terrorist watch list?

1092
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:19,802
是的
Mmm-hmm

1093
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,388
明白了 - 等等你说什么?
- Got it
- Wait, what?

1094
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,098
那AK子弹要多少钱?
Okay, how much for the AK ammo?

1095
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,475
1发10美分 - 太他妈便宜了
- 10 cents a round
- That's fucking amazing

1096
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:27,726
那运输方面呢?
And what about shipping?

1097
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,436
由俄罗斯飞行员驾驶的苏联伊留申76式飞机
You can get Ilyushin 76
through Russian pilots

1098
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:30,688
每趟8万
80K per flight

1099
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,773
抱歉 你是说恐怖分子监控名单上有你的名字?
I'm sorry, you're on
a terrorist watch list?

1100
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:34,066
搞什么!
<i>What the fuck!</i>

1101
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,276
你是国防部的吗?反应别这么大 伙计
Do you work for Homeland Security?
Relax, bro

1102
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,404
你们最好再好好商量一下
You two should probably talk this over

1103
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,115
我们会的 而且我们非常感兴趣
We will But we are very interested

1104
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,617
很好 我的飞机明早10点起飞
Good My flight leaves
tomorrow morning at 10:00

1105
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,786
我不能在这里待超过48小时的时间
I can't spend more than 48 hours
in this dump

1106
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,914
我总是这么说 最多只能在维加斯浪两天
That's what I always say
Vegas is a two-day town

1107
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,292
我说的是美国
I was talking about America

1108
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,968
这可是苏联集团的非标准武器
We're talking exclusive access
to a stockpile

1109
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,512
和子弹库存的专属访问权
of Soviet Bloc non-standard
weapons and ammo

1110
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,347
这肯定能帮我们拿下这笔生意的
That's going to win this deal for us

1111
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,974
他在恐怖分子的监控名单上!
He's on a terrorist watch list!

1112
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:10,436
管这么多干嘛 如果有人带剪刀上飞机 都可能上那名单
Whatever People end up on that list
for bringing scissors onto an airplane!

1113
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,187
他绝不是因为这个上的名单
That's not why he's on the list

1114
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:17,526
听着 国防部想要在全世界资源如此短缺的情况下
Look, the Pentagon wants
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo

1115
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,154
要1亿发的AK-47子弹
in the middle of a worldwide shortage

1116
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,531
你觉得这么多子弹从何而来?
Where do you think
they think that's going to come from?

1117
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,868
就是从跟他一样的不法分子那儿来
A bunch of shady motherfuckers
like that guy

1118
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,496
这就是工作
This is the job

1119
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,498
你必须和那些美国政府不能直接与之
To do business with the people in places

1120
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:34,668
产生商业来往的人做生意
the US government
can't do business with directly

1121
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,004
就这么简单
It's as simple as that

1122
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:39,631
操!
Fuck!

1123
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,320
嘿 小伙子们
Hey, boys

1124
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,156
我们讨论过了 我们愿意和你合作
So we discussed it,
and we'd like to move forward

1125
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,408
太好了 恭喜
Fantastic Congratulations

1126
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:08,702
但我们必须验验货 - 没问题
- But we have to see the merchandise
- Oh, of course

1127
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,537
亲自去验
On site, in person

1128
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:13,165
你们去过阿尔巴尼亚吗?
You guys ever been to Albania?

1129
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:14,875
老实说 不是你昨晚提到的话
Honestly, until last night

1130
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,752
我还真不知道这个国家真的存在
I didn't even know it was
a real fucking country

1131
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,545
噢 那个地方挺美的
Oh, it's a beautiful place

1132
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,715
先进屋吧 我给我的手下打个电话 叫他们安排一下
Come on in I'll call my guy
and we'll set it up

1133
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,596
阿尔巴尼亚有很多特质
<i>Albania is a lot of things</i>

1134
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,015
但美丽的地方绝对不是其中之一
<i>But a beautiful place is not one of them</i>

1135
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,559
我们换乘了两趟飞机
<i>It took us three separate flights</i>

1136
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,062
飞了整整22个小时才到这里
<i>and 22 hours just to get there</i>

1137
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,564
亨利的手下派了一个司机
<i>Henry's people sent a driver</i>

1138
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,233
去机场接我们
<i>to pick us up at the airport</i>

1139
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,069
而这个家伙一直讲个不停
<i>and the guy would not stop talking</i>

1140
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,029
我倒下了 但她又让我活过来
I fall over, she revive me

1141
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,534
但所有的这一切都没有浇灭埃佛隆的热情
<i>But none of that diminished
Efraim's enthusiasm</i>

1142
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,911
他始终坚信这一次我们一定能大有作为
<i>He really believed
this could be the answer</i>

1143
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,609
欢迎你们 AEY
Welcome, AEY

1144
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,444
我是于利・皮纳瑞
I am Yili Panari,

1145
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:26,947
阿尔巴利亚最大的武器出口公司的老板
<i>head of Albania's largest
military export company</i>

1146
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,449
我是埃佛隆・迪乌利 很高兴认识你
Efraim Diveroli Good to see you

1147
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:34,121
这位是我的合作伙伴戴维・佩豪斯
This is my business associate,
David Packouz

1148
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,956
很高兴认识你 - 你好吗?
- Glad to meet you
- How you doing?

1149
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:37,624
额
Uh

1150
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,293
谢谢你们准备的标语
Thank you for the sign

1151
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,295
专程为你们准备的
Oh It's for you

1152
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:44,339
我知道 所以我才谢谢你们嘛
Yes, I know
I said thank you for the sign

1153
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,760
给我们看看货吧
So, show us what you got

1154
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:56,476
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

1155
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,645
阿尔巴利亚军队的储物室
Storage for the Albanian army

1156
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,108
这个国家还有700多间这样的地方
We have 700 more like it
across the country

1157
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,319
你们有700间像这样的仓库?
You have 700 warehouses like this?

1158
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:06,862
不仅仅是仓库
Not just warehouse

1159
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,990
我们还利用教堂医院学校存放装备
We use church, hospital, school

1160
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,326
阿尔巴利亚是全世界武器最多的国家
Albania is most armed country
in the world

1161
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,286
嘿 真棒恭喜你们
Hey, that's cool Congrats, bro

1162
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,371
这里就像个博物馆一样
<i>It was like
a fucking museum in there</i>

1163
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:18,165
这里的很多武器 自冷战之后
<i>Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight</i>

1164
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,958
就再也没见过光
<i>since the Cold War</i>

1165
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,793
但这对我们来讲不是什么问题
<i>But that didn't matter to us</i>

1166
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,212
我们唯一在意的就是AK子弹
<i>All we cared about was the AK ammo</i>

1167
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:28,383
别担心 你们需要的东西我们这里多的是
It's okay We have plenty
of what you came for

1168
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:35,515
所有的集装箱里都装满了你们想要的子弹
All these containers
are filled with your bullets

1169
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,019
你什么意思 所有的子弹都在这里?
What do you mean,
all the bullets are right here?

1170
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,482
一共有1亿2千6百万发
126 million rounds

1171
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,653
我去
Fuck me

1172
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,530
准备好大开眼界吧
Yeah Fuck us all

1173
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:08,382
这些子弹放了多久了?
How old are these?

1174
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:12,719
30年也有可能40年了 这些AK-47子弹
30, maybe 40 years AK-47 bullets

1175
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,055
如果保存妥当一辈子都不会坏
can last forever if properly stored

1176
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,057
好吧 那这些保存得怎么样?
Right Well, how were these stored?

1177
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,600
谁他妈在乎这些保存得好不好?
Uh, who gives a fuck
how these were stored?

1178
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,060
重要的是还能不能用
All that matters is they fucking work

1179
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:21,561
它们还能用吗?
Do they work?

1180
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:26,191
你自己试试
You try

1181
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,619
子弹都能用
<i>They fucking worked</i>

1182
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:42,374
整个国防市场都在争抢这笔买卖
<i>The entire defense industry
was scrambling over this deal</i>

1183
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:45,585
而帮助我们赢得投标的关键就装在这23个
<i>And the key to it was sitting
in 23 shipping containers</i>

1184
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:50,132
位于世界另一端的 破旧不堪的仓库集装箱里
<i>in the back of a rusted out warehouse
on the other side of the world</i>

1185
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:03,773
*迈阿密 佛罗里达州*

1186
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:06,773
我们回去的时间恰巧赶上
<i>We got back with just enough time</i>

1187
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:09,609
提交投标的最后期限
<i>to submit our bid
before the government's deadline</i>

1188
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:14,406
接下来就是无尽的等待
<i>And then we waited</i>

1189
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,452
我们等了5个月
<i>We waited five months</i>

1190
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,163
爸爸
Pa

1191
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,124
戴维!
<i>David!</i>

1192
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,294
那是埃佛隆? - 什么?
- Is that Efraim?
- What?

1193
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,465
是吗?  - 戴维!
- Is it?
- David!

1194
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,091
我们赢了!
We fucking won!

1195
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,762
天啊 我们拿下了"阿富汗问题"
Holy shit We won the Afghan deal

1196
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,472
什么? - 我们拿下了"阿富汗问题"!
- What?
- We won the Afghan deal!

1197
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,931
我们赢了吗? - 赢了!
- We won?
- We fucking won!

1198
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,767
兄弟!你不是在寻我开心吧?
Bro! Are you fucking kidding me?

1199
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,977
我们真的赢了! - 是的 他妈的!
- We fucking won!
- Yeah, motherfucker!

1200
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,273
太棒了!天啊!
Yeah! Yeah, motherfucker!

1201
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,490
在我们开工之前
<i>Before we could begin,</i>

1202
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,868
AEY还是必须经过政府的审查
<i>AEY still needed to be vetted
by the government</i>

1203
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,495
整个过程让人郁闷纠结
<i>It's a pain-in-the ass process</i>

1204
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,163
其中包括3个独立的审计
<i>involving three separate audits</i>

1205
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,957
以及一场面试
<i>and an in-person interview</i>

1206
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,668
审计是最头疼的部分
<i>The audits were the biggest hurdle</i>

1207
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,505
我们连一个真正的会计员都没有
<i>I mean, we didn't even
have a real bookkeeper</i>

1208
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,715
我们甚至连一本书都没有
<i>We didn't have real books</i>

1209
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,343
我们必须伪造AEY在过去3年里的
<i>We had to fabricate AEY's accounting</i>

1210
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,386
财务情况
<i>going back three years</i>

1211
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:22,557
分类账银行结单 还有假冒的订购单
<i>Ledgers, bank statements,
phony purchase orders,</i>

1212
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,643
所有的一切都是伪造的
<i>we forged it all</i>

1213
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,064
两周之后 我们来到了伊利诺斯州的
<i>Two weeks later, we were in Rock Island,</i>

1214
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,649
罗克艾兰和来自美国军队的
<i>Illinois for our big meeting</i>

1215
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,735
采购专员进行最为重要的面试
<i>with procurement officers
from the US Military</i>

1216
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:39,241
我们紧张到快窒息
<i>We were pretty fucking nervous</i>

1217
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:43,078
所以埃夫拉伊建议 我们在停车场先爽一发
<i>So Efraim thought it'd be a good idea
to get high in the parking lot</i>

1218
01:08:46,546 --> 01:08:48,880
*岩岛市军械库(华盛顿州)*

1219
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:53,880
等等
Hold up

1220
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,760
我们走路的声音听起来是不是不止两个人?
Does it sound like
we're more than two people right now?

1221
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:01,388
没错
Yeah

1222
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,224
这后劲可真大
<i>It was really strong shit</i>

1223
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:05,517
好吧
Okay

1224
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,241
非常好
This is very impressive

1225
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,910
非常好
<i>Very impressive</i>

1226
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,872
说实话 看了你们的历史记录 我们一开始还很担心
Frankly, we were a tad concerned
with your performance history

1227
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,790
你们是否能处理好这种量级的单子
against a deal of this size

1228
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,750
但在见到你们本人后
But after meeting you two face to face,

1229
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:33,920
我们感觉自己选对人了
we feel like we're in good hands
on this one

1230
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,464
我们不会让你们失望的
Well, we won't let you down,

1231
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:38,425
先生们
sirs

1232
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:39,759
更别提
Not to mention,

1233
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,804
你们出的价也节省了我们不少纠结的时间
your bid was far too attractive
for us to pass up

1234
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:47,434
谢谢 很高兴听到你们这么讲
Thank you I mean, that's great to hear
because we really worked hard on this

1235
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,436
抱歉 打断一下
Sorry Excuse me

1236
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,147
你们之中刚刚有人讲
One of you just said

1237
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,733
我们的出价非常具有吸引力
our bid was too attractive to pass up

1238
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,776
此话怎讲 能说得具体点吗?
What did you mean by that, exactly?

1239
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,946
他的意思就是说 你们的出价比所有人都要低
He means you boys lowballed
the shit out of your competition

1240
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,618
我知道
Yeah Uh

1241
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,453
但是低多少呢?
By how much?

1242
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:07,954
几百万
Millions

1243
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,252
好吧
Okay

1244
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,297
我很好奇
Just for me I

1245
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:21,176
具体是几百万?
I'm curious, how many millions?

1246
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:24,971
严格上来讲 我们不能跟你们讨论这个问题的
Well, technically, we're not supposed to
discuss that with you,

1247
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,850
但管他这么多呢
but what the hell

1248
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:35,106
你们出的价比出价第二低的人还要再低5300万
You guys came in $53 million
lower than the nearest competition

1249
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,777
操!操!
Fuck! Fuck!

1250
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:40,820
他妈的!
Motherfucker!

1251
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,865
5千3百万
<i>$53 million</i>

1252
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:46,826
我们很好
We're okay

1253
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:50,038
往好的方面想想
Look at the bright side

1254
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,831
这是历史上第一次
For once, the American taxpayer

1255
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,167
美国的纳税人在国防问题上花值了钱
is getting a good deal
on a defense contract

1256
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,962
谁他妈在乎纳税人啊
Man, fuck the American taxpayer

1257
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:04,560
*我们遇到大麻烦了*

1258
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,560
有人吗?
Hello?

1259
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,190
伊兹?
Iz?

1260
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:21,695
嘿 艾拉 嗨
Hey, Ella Hi

1261
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:23,989
你还好吗 亲爱的?
How are you, sweetie?

1262
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,575
嘿 你知道她那双蓝色的凉鞋放哪儿了吗?
Hey Do you know
where her blue sandals are?

1263
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,369
噢 嘿
Oh, hey

1264
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,538
额 我也不清楚
Um, I'm not sure

1265
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,208
等一下 我们能谈谈吗?
<i>But listen, can we talk for a sec?</i>

1266
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,835
没问题
<i>Mmm-hmm</i>

1267
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,713
我要回阿尔巴利亚几个星期
I need to go back to Albania
for a couple weeks

1268
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,673
最多1个月
<i>A month, tops</i>

1269
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:45,385
好的 没问题
Sure No problem

1270
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:05,447
嘿 出什么事了吗?
Hey, what's going on?

1271
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:09,075
我要带艾拉回去跟我妈住一段时间
Ella and I are going to stay
with my mom for a while

1272
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,744
什么?你在说什么?
What? What are you talking about?

1273
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:12,787
伊兹出什么事了?
Iz, what happened?

1274
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:15,123
你为什么不告诉我 你去过伊拉克?
How come you didn't tell me
you went to Iraq?

1275
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,751
我在你的电脑上查找水管工的电话
I was looking for the plumber's number

1276
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,253
然后看到了那张照片
on your computer and I saw the photos

1277
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:22,797
你听我解释
I can explain

1278
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,926
你说过你从来没离开过约旦的酒店
You said you never left
the hotel room in Jordan

1279
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,764
我知道因为我不想让你担心
I know Because I didn't
want to freak you out

1280
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:33,141
为什么每次我抓到你撒谎
Why is it every time I catch you in a lie

1281
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:36,770
你总想说服我 你这么做是出于对我的考虑?
you try to convince me
that you lied for my benefit?

1282
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,315
你为什么就不肯承认自己是个骗子?
At what point do you
just admit you're a liar?

1283
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,610
伊兹 求你别这么说
Iz, would you stop, please?

1284
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,571
我们说过要互相坦诚
We said we'd tell each other everything

1285
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:50,325
你发过誓的! - 我知道!是我搞砸了
- You promised!
- I know! Okay, I fucked up

1286
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,494
你还有什么秘密瞒着我?
What else aren't you telling me?

1287
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:53,745
没了 - 我不信
- Nothing
- No

1288
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,288
真的
Seriously

1289
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,250
我现在什么秘密都没有
You know everything now

1290
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:07,675
好吧 你怎么不问我为什么要找水管工的电话?
Okay Aren't you going to ask me
why I called the plumber?

1291
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,136
对 为什么啊?
Yeah, sure What happened?

1292
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:15,767
客房厕所的水管有点漏水
The pipe is leaking in the guest bathroom

1293
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:22,982
我去检查结果发现了这个
I found this

1294
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:27,028
我猜猜你是不想让我担心?
Let me guess
You didn't want to freak me out?

1295
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,321
等一下
Okay, hold on

1296
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,156
我是在水池底下藏了钱
So I hid some money under the sink

1297
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:31,449
这有什么大不了的?
What's the big deal?

1298
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,660
大不了的是这些钱 你是背着我藏的!
The big deal is you hid it from me!

1299
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:34,869
不 我没有!
No, I didn't!

1300
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,621
那你是怕谁拿走?
Then who did you hide it from?

1301
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:44,504
我也不知道这么做太蠢了 你是对的
<i>I don't know It was stupid You're right</i>

1302
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,012
等你有更好的理由的时候 再来找我们
We're going to leave
before you think of something else to say

1303
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,890
伊兹 对不起
<i>Iz, I'm sorry</i>

1304
01:13:58,518 --> 01:13:59,853
伊兹!
- Iz!

1305
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:07,485
该死
Oh, fuck

1306
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:57,994
嘿 你好吗 伙计?
<i>Hey, what's up, man?</i>

1307
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,287
你好吗?
What's up?

1308
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:00,538
刚准备好离开
<i>Just getting ready to leave</i>

1309
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,043
这是什么?
What is that?

1310
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,713
我想谢谢你愿意去那边出差
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to go on this trip

1311
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,382
这些年你为公司
It's not lost on me,

1312
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,885
做出的牺牲 我都记在心上
the sacrifice you're making
for this company

1313
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:15,512
对此我非常感谢
And I really appreciate it

1314
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:20,391
"送给我的搭档 戴维 世界在你脚下"
"To my partner, David
The world is yours"

1315
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:25,688
《疤面煞星》里的台词 - 我记得
- It's from <i>Scarface</i>
- Of course, man I remember

1316
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:28,691
谢谢
Thank you

1317
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:30,360
不用
Yeah

1318
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,780
嘿 在我走之前
Uh, hey, before I go,

1319
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:35,615
我想
I just wanted

1320
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:38,326
这是什么?
What's this?

1321
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,913
是我们的合作合约 7：3分成
It's our partnership agreement 70-30

1322
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,332
我想弄得正式点
I just wanted to make it official

1323
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,294
当然没问题
Yeah, of course

1324
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:52,298
这是个好主意 - 那好
- It's a good idea
- Cool

1325
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:56,219
天啊 要在阿尔巴利亚待8个星期啊
Man, eight fucking weeks in Albania

1326
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,846
伊兹要一辈子都不理我了
<i>Iz is going to hate me forever</i>

1327
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:02,976
不 她以后一定会每天都把你服侍得妥妥帖帖的
No, she's going to suck your cock
every day for a year

1328
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,107
因为我们很快就会有3千万进账了
Because we're on the verge
of making $30 million

1329
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,403
没错
Yeah, man

1330
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,239
加油 把它拿下
Go crush it

1331
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:18,116
谢谢你 伙计
Thanks, bro

1332
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,292
好了
Nice

1333
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:40,096
嘿 我是伊兹 有事请留言
<i>Hey, you've reached Iz
You know what to do</i>

1334
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,933
别这样伊兹 别不接我电话啊
- Come on, Iz Don't cut me off like this

1335
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,355
我现在在阿尔巴尼亚在酒店里
I'm in Albania, at the hotel

1336
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,609
这边的号码 我已经告诉你妈妈了
Left the number with your mom

1337
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:55,528
求你快回我电话吧
And if you could please just call me back

1338
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:57,905
我真的很想你好吗?
because I really miss you Okay?

1339
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,491
我爱你
And I love you

1340
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:02,910
再见
Bye

1341
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,131
早上好 伙计
Good morning, buddy

1342
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,841
嘿 巴什基姆
Hey, Bashkim

1343
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:20,678
我给你买了早点 在这边麦当劳买的
Oh, I bring you Kolonat
It's our McDonald's

1344
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,389
我不饿 不过还是谢谢
Yeah, I'm good But thanks

1345
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:27,268
现在出发吗?
We go to work now?

1346
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:44,077
不对 不不不 我说过我要两辆卡车
Uh-huh No, no, no
I said I need two trucks

1347
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,496
现在这里只来了一辆
Yeah, you just got the one here right now

1348
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,874
听着 现在我的货运飞机就在机场等着的
Yeah Look, I got a cargo
plane sitting at the airport

1349
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,919
是的 我知道我知道
Yeah, I know I know

1350
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:54,796
嘿 我等会再打给你
Hey, let me call you right back

1351
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,339
嘿 停一下!停车!停车!
Hey, stop! Stop, stop!

1352
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,299
等等 等等 等等!嘿快停车!
Hold up, hold up, hold up!
Hey, turn that off!

1353
01:17:58,508 --> 01:17:59,759
这他妈是什么?
What the fuck is that?

1354
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,263
你从哪儿弄来的?
Where did you get this?

1355
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:08,935
哟!什么事?
Yo! What's up?

1356
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:10,728
嘿 伙计我们有麻烦了
<i>Hey, man, we got a problem</i>

1357
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,564
你现在在哪儿? - 我在酒吧
- Where you at?
<i>- I'm at Liv, bro</i>

1358
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,359
准备钓几个古巴的漂亮美眉
Trying to bang some Cuban chick
who's waiting for me at my table

1359
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,568
怎么了 出什么事了?
<i>Why, what do we got?</i>

1360
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,278
我就直说了
Let me get this straight
I'm in Albania right now

1361
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:20,488
我现在在阿尔巴尼亚 冻得屎都要出来了
freezing my ass off

1362
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:21,948
而你却在酒吧逍遥快活?
<i>You're at Liv, trying to get laid?</i>

1363
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,616
戴维 这边现在是凌晨1点
David, it's 1:00 am here

1364
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,284
我刚刚吸了点大麻
I'm blowing off some steam

1365
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,245
凌晨1点 刚好就是你应该待在办公室的时间
Yeah, 1:00 am is when you're
supposed to be at the office

1366
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:28,579
因为我们就是这个时候
because that's the middle of fucking day

1367
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,123
跟其他国家的人做生意的
in every country we do business with

1368
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,542
听我说 AK子弹的货出了问题
Look, we got a problem
with the AK ammunition

1369
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,461
什么问题? - 它们是中国产的
- What kind of problem?
<i>- It's Chinese</i>

1370
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,423
中国?那是什么意思?
Chinese, bro?
What does that even mean, Chinese?

1371
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,174
我是说这批子弹都是来自中国的
It means it's from China

1372
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,720
你在说什么?验货的时候我也在场啊 我检查过那批子弹了
What are you talking about?
I was there, I saw the ammo

1373
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:44,929
我也确认过啊
<i>We both did</i>

1374
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,264
我不知道该怎么跟你说
Yeah, look, I don't know what to tell you

1375
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:47,682
我们被耍了好吗?我们被骗了
They fucked us Okay? We got played

1376
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,601
等一下 你怎么那些子弹是中国产的?
<i>Hold on How do you even
know it's Chinese?</i>

1377
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,604
因为每一个箱子外面都写着中文
<i>There's Chinese writing
on every fucking crate</i>

1378
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,606
相信我绝对是中国产的
Trust me, it's Chinese

1379
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:05,867
好吧
Yeah

1380
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:07,118
亨利你搞什么!
<i>Henry, what the fuck!</i>

1381
01:19:07,285 --> 01:19:08,911
这两天我们一直在给你打电话!
<i>We've been trying to reach you
for two days!</i>

1382
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,204
这里是埃佛隆和戴维
It's Efraim and David

1383
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:11,831
我们碰到大麻烦了
We have a serious fucking problem

1384
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,292
我在听
I'm listening

1385
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,627
那些AK子弹全是中国产的
The AK ammunition, it's Chinese

1386
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:18,713
怎么你觉得那群被塔利班打得屁滚尿流的
<i>What, you think the Afghans
who are getting</i>

1387
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:22,008
阿富汗人会在意他们的子弹是哪里产的吗?
shot up by the Taliban give a shit
where their ammo comes from?

1388
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,634
他们不在意 但五角大楼就不一样了
No, but the Pentagon does

1389
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,344
亨利 你知道我们不能用中国产的东西!
Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!

1390
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:27,263
美国对于中国有禁运令
America has an embargo against China

1391
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:31,225
你只叫你的手下 给我们看了一箱阿尔巴尼亚的子弹
You had your boys show us the one crate
of Albanian ammo in the entire country

1392
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,895
抱歉 有人阻止你们
I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you
from inspecting the other crates?

1393
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,482
你们有没有想过要问清楚子弹的原产地在哪儿?
Did you even bother to ask
what the country of origin was?

1394
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:38,983
谁他妈会问这些问题?
Who the fuck would ask that?

1395
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,070
亨利 我面前是1亿发……
Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds

1396
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,032
你卖给我们的非法中国造子弹
of illegal Chinese ammunition
that you sold us

1397
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,492
我们应该怎么办?
What are we supposed to do?

1398
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,494
该怎么办怎么办!
Do your fucking job!

1399
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,748
美国政府会睁一只眼闭一只眼的
The US government
wants to look the other way

1400
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:54,999
不要画蛇添足
Don't give them a reason not to

1401
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,752
还有既然现在是你们在处理发货的问题就要分清楚
And while you're at it,
learn the difference between

1402
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,713
"我们遇到麻烦了"和"你遇到麻烦了"的区别
"We have a problem"
and "You have a problem"

1403
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:02,882
该死!
Fuck!

1404
01:20:10,881 --> 01:20:12,882
*这听起来好像不合法*

1405
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:25,613
我们完蛋了 这些子弹就是一堆破铜烂铁
<i>We were fucked
The ammo was worthless</i>

1406
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,866
而我被困在阿尔巴尼亚 尝试联系东欧的其他供货商
<i>and I was stuck in Albania
trying to piece together new suppliers</i>

1407
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:31,494
希望能把货拼凑完整
<i>from all over Eastern Europe</i>

1408
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:55,893
我的天啊
Holy shit

1409
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:57,562
你来这干嘛伙计?
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

1410
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,855
我有计划了
I have a big idea

1411
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:00,982
你是怎么进来的?
How did you get in my room?

1412
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,483
他们让我进来的
They let me in

1413
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:04,652
我是个很有信誉的人
I'm a trustworthy guy

1414
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:07,530
他们不仅放我进来 还给我准备了客房服务
<i>Not only did they let me in,
they brought me room service</i>

1415
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,616
总之 我有很好的主意
Anyway, I have a big fucking idea

1416
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,326
是吗?是什么?
Yeah? What's that?

1417
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:13,786
我们重新包装怎么样?
What if we repack?

1418
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,329
包装什么?
Repack what?

1419
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,539
子弹啊!
The bullets!

1420
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,583
把它们全部都重新包装?
What if we repack them all?

1421
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,167
1亿发?
100 million rounds?

1422
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:23,129
戴维 这不是不可能的
David, it can be done

1423
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,883
你这样想啊 这样做还能减少我们运货的花销
Think about it
We'll also save a fortune on shipping

1424
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,176
我们把那些又大又重的木盒子
We trade out all the big,
heavy wooden crates

1425
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,928
换成轻便的纸箱
for light cardboard boxes

1426
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:33,180
但那还是中国造的子弹啊
Yeah, but it would still be Chinese ammo

1427
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,641
拿着条毛巾来说吧
Look at this towel Okay?

1428
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,769
上面写的是土耳其制造
Turkish Made in Turkey

1429
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,482
不再是了 它现在就是一条阿尔巴尼亚毛巾了
Not anymore Now it's an Albanian towel

1430
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,029
只有当外包装上写明它是中国造时它才是中国造
It's only Chinese
if the packaging says it's Chinese

1431
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,910
我知道 但这样做是不合法的呀
Yeah But I mean, that's
also fucking illegal, man

1432
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,579
我们只有两个选择
We have two options

1433
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:59,040
要么重新包装然后寄出去
We either repack this shit and send it off

1434
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,959
要么和这3亿的大单子说拜拜
or we can walk away
from a $300 million-deal

1435
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:05,129
你想怎么办?
What do you want to do?

1436
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:10,176
当你这么比较的时候 其实就只有一个选择了
<i>When you put it like that
there's really only one option</i>

1437
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:13,471
我们的司机巴什基姆给我们介绍了一个他的朋友
<i>Our driver Bashkim
introduced us to his friend</i>

1438
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,057
他在地拉那外拥有一家包装储物公司
<i>who owned a boxing and storage company
out of Tirana</i>

1439
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,060
他叫恩维尔 是我的发小
This is Enver I grew up with him

1440
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,269
很高兴认识你恩维尔
Nice to meet you, Enver

1441
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:24,190
我也是 巴什基姆把你们遇到的问题稍微跟我提了一下
You too Bashkim told me
a little about your situation

1442
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,026
简单来说 我们现在的包装太重了
Yeah, look, to put it simply,
we have a weight problem

1443
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,195
我们要运输数量巨大的子弹
We're shipping
a large quantity of ammunition

1444
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,113
从阿尔巴尼亚到阿富汗
<i>from Albania to Afghanistan</i>

1445
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:32,740
而现在它们是装在一个铁皮盒里
<i>Right now, it's packed in heavy tins</i>

1446
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,158
外面还有一个非常重的木箱
inside big wooden crates

1447
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:35,576
我们想要转而用塑料袋……
And what we would like to do

1448
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,578
装这些子弹
is to transfer those bullets
into plastic bags

1449
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:39,205
然后再把袋子放进
and then put those in double-walled,

1450
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:40,748
双层的纤维板里
<i>corrugated fiberboard boxes</i>

1451
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:43,918
你知道那是什么吗?
Do you know what those are?

1452
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:46,504
我当然知道 为什么要换包装?
Yeah, of course For what reason?

1453
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:47,964
刚刚不是说了吗
We just told you

1454
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,507
这个地方的人怎么都这样啊?
What the fuck is it with this country?

1455
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:54,637
原始的包装 它的份量太重了
The original packaging, it's too heavy

1456
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,682
然后箱子有特别多 所以我们想提高效率
Too many crates We need to streamline

1457
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,226
好的 有多少个箱子?
Okay How many crates?

1458
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:03,396
很多子弹 都有1亿发昵
A lot It's 100 million
rounds of ammunition

1459
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:08,067
我明白 但是具体有多少个箱子?
Understood But how many actual crates?

1460
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:13,322
68520个
We have 68,520 crates

1461
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:16,283
我有见过
I've seen it

1462
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,160
非常壮观
It's fucking crazy

1463
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:44,979
算好了
Done

1464
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,994
50个人工作的话 需要8周时间完成
So 50 men, eight weeks

1465
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:04,457
10万块我就愿意做
I can do it for $100,000

1466
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,585
10万美元?
100,000 US dollars?

1467
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,961
是的
Yeah

1468
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:12,339
请等一下 - 我们讨论一下
- Give us a second
- Yeah One second, please

1469
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,343
好的 我要非常严肃地跟你讨论一个问题
Okay I'm going to talk very seriously

1470
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:18,054
想要把笑憋住非常不容易
<i>It was hard not to laugh</i>

1471
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:21,182
不仅是因为这个人帮我们挽回了这次交易
<i>I mean, not only was this guy
saving the entire deal,</i>

1472
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,933
并且重新包装所有子弹
<i>but by repacking all the ammo</i>

1473
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:26,520
会提高我们的利润将近3百万
<i>we would increase our profit margin
by almost $3 million</i>

1474
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:28,230
今晚晚餐在哪儿吃?
Where should we get dinner tonight?

1475
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,733
酒店旁边有家馆子味道还不错
There's this place by the hotel
It's pretty good

1476
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:33,110
那好就这么定了
Okay All right, go ahead

1477
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:34,612
成交
Okay, deal

1478
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:43,120
最后的效果比我们预想中还要好
<i>It was even better than we thought</i>

1479
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:46,665
我们用轻便的纤维板代替笨重的木质结构
<i>We were trading heavy wooden crates
for light cardboard boxes</i>

1480
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,627
一个塑料袋只重8盎司
<i>Eight ounce tins for plastic bags</i>

1481
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,088
通过重新包装子弹
<i>By repacking the ammo,</i>

1482
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:54,882
我们将总重量减轻了约180吨
<i>we would lighten our overall load
by 180 tons</i>

1483
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,261
那可是180吨啊!
<i>180 fucking tons!</i>

1484
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,140
那意味着更少的航运次数更轻的飞机以及更少的耗油量
<i>That meant fewer flights
using lighter planes burning less fuel</i>

1485
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,895
所有的这一切节省下来的开支都将进入我们自己的荷包
<i>Which all added up to more money for us</i>

1486
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,902
2007年12月8日这一天
<i>On December 8th, 2007,</i>

1487
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:17,363
AEY将第一批5百万发子弹送往了
<i>AEY delivered the first 5 million rounds</i>

1488
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:19,573
阿富汗军队
<i>to the Afghan army</i>

1489
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:23,410
所有的一切都进行得很顺利
<i>It went off without a hitch</i>

1490
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,378
快嘛 再说一遍 宝贝 快点
Come on, just say it once, sweetie
Come on

1491
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:35,589
叫"爸爸"叫"爸爸"
Say "dada" Say "dada"

1492
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:37,883
我们必须得下了 戴维
<i>We really have to go, David</i>

1493
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,427
别啊 嘿 再聊5分钟嘛 求你了 求你了
No, hey, five more minutes,
please? Please?

1494
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:44,014
我们要吃饭了 妈妈在催了
<i>We're about to eat My mom's waiting</i>

1495
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:48,269
艾拉 给爸爸再见
<i>Ella, wave goodbye to Daddy Hmm</i>

1496
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:49,770
再见 艾拉
Bye-bye, Ella

1497
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,148
圣诞快乐 我爱你
Merry Christmas I love you

1498
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:57,319
嘿 你能把她先抱给你妈照顾 我们单独说两句吗?
Hey, can you give her to your mom
so that we can talk for a minute?

1499
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:58,612
抱歉 戴维
<i>I'm sorry, David</i>

1500
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,073
我们过几天再打给你好吗?
<i>We'll call you in a couple days Okay?</i>

1501
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:04,118
再见
<i>Bye</i>

1502
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:26,390
嘿 我是戴维
Hey, this is David

1503
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:29,268
伙计 你想听个很操蛋的事吗?
<i>Bro, you want to hear
something totally fucked up?</i>

1504
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:31,187
圣诞快乐 埃佛隆
Merry Christmas, Efraim

1505
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:32,479
今天是圣诞吗?
<i>It's Christmas?</i>

1506
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:33,731
所以公司里才没人
That's why nobody's here

1507
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:36,233
我还打算把所有人都开除了呢
I was about to fire the entire office

1508
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:38,110
话说回来 我之前去那边的时候
Anyway, when I was over there,

1509
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,321
和巴什基姆说了几句
I was talking to our boy, Bashkim

1510
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:41,614
你知道他叔叔
Did you know his uncle

1511
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,116
在阿尔巴尼亚国防部上班吗?
<i>works at the Albanian defense ministry?</i>

1512
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:45,326
不 我不知道
No, I didn't know that

1513
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:46,577
他是在那儿上班
<i>Well, he does</i>

1514
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:49,538
所以我就问他 "你知道我觉得什么很有意思吗 巴什基姆?"
So I said, "You know what would be
interesting to me, Bashkim?

1515
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:54,084
"我一直很好奇 亨利每发AK子弹付多少钱给阿尔巴尼亚人"
"I'd be curious to know what Henry
is paying the Albanians for the AK ammo"

1516
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:55,294
埃佛隆?
Efraim?

1517
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,046
你猜他发现了什么?
<i>Do you know what he found out?</i>

1518
01:26:57,254 --> 01:27:00,716
那个混蛋每发子弹只付给他们25美分
That motherfucker is paying
two and a half cents a round

1519
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:03,010
但他竟然收我们4倍的价钱!
<i>He's charging us a 400% markup!</i>

1520
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,012
那又怎样?我们也是这么干的啊
Yeah So what? We do the same thing

1521
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:06,513
但这是我们谈的合同
Yeah, but this is our contract

1522
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:09,350
而因为他和他该死的中国造子弹 差点害我们洗白
And we almost lost it because of him
and his Chinese fucking bullets

1523
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:10,559
但我们现在不是做得好好的吗
But we didn't lose it

1524
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:11,852
这不是重点!
<i>That's not the point!</i>

1525
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:14,438
我要想个法子把这个混蛋从我们的生意中踢出去
I want to figure out a way
to cut this cocksucker out of the deal

1526
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:15,898
埃佛隆 别这样
Efraim, stop

1527
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,149
不 你听我说
<i>No, listen to me</i>

1528
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:19,026
我是认真的
I'm serious, man

1529
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:20,486
我们想赚钱
We're making money, okay?

1530
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:23,530
他也想赚钱 互不干扰 一切都在井然有序地进行着
He's making money,
the whole thing is fucking working

1531
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,074
别搞砸了
Don't mess with it

1532
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:27,701
我才不管这么多 他在搞事情!
<i>I don't give a fuck He's ripping us off!</i>

1533
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:29,912
我是很认真的
Look, I'm serious, okay?

1534
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,790
如果你要是敢掺一脚 我马上乘最快航班回来
I'm going to be on the next flight
out of here if you pull that shit

1535
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:36,794
喔 伙计 你不必威胁我
Whoa Bro, you don't have to threaten me

1536
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:38,420
好吗?我是你搭档
All right? I'm your partner

1537
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,547
没错 但你的表现让我很不放心
Yeah, it doesn't always feel like that

1538
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,384
这笔生意是我找到的 我在这边
<i>I found this deal And I'm over here</i>

1539
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,178
拼死工作 而你坐在迈阿密的办公室里整天就帮倒忙
doing all the work and you're in Miami
trying to sabotage it

1540
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,264
我怎么又帮倒忙了?
How am I sabotaging it?

1541
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:51,725
你想教训亨利 就像你教训其他人一样
By trying to fuck over Henry,
the way you fuck over everybody else

1542
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:59,650
你说的没错 亨利也是我们的合伙人
You're right Henry's our partner

1543
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,613
没有他 就没有这笔生意
<i>He's the reason we got this deal</i>

1544
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:08,826
我只是想 为我们打抱不平 但是可能过头了
I was just looking out for us
and I took it too far

1545
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:12,579
别担心 兄弟 我不会动他的
Don't sweat it, bro I'll leave it alone

1546
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,914
谢谢你
<i>Thank you</i>

1547
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,875
我们现在不能意气用事 伙计
<i>We can't push our luck
with this shit, man</i>

1548
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,797
好的 我过几天再打给你再见
All right, I'll talk to you soon Bye

1549
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:33,225
喔 干什么?嘿
Whoa What the fuck? Hey

1550
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,561
该死!住手
Fuck! Stop

1551
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,189
别打了!我不明白你们在说什么!
Stop! I don't understand!

1552
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,951
现在明白了吗?
Do you understand now?

1553
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,996
明白了
Yeah Yes

1554
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,750
你们真的认为能把我从自己的买卖中踢出去吗?
Did you really think
you could cut me out of my own deal?

1555
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,670
求你了
<i>Please</i>

1556
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:02,898
操
Fuck

1557
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:05,526
操
Fuck

1558
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:21,291
戴维 我们需要谈谈
David, we need to talk

1559
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,793
现在不行
Now's not a good time

1560
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:27,297
我现在还没收到钱
I have not been paid yet

1561
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,007
你说什么?这个月的钱吗?
What do you mean? Like for the month?

1562
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:30,384
从开始到现在
Ever

1563
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:32,469
一分钱都没打给你?
You haven't been paid anything?

1564
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,097
你的同伴连电话都不接
Your partner doesn't return phone calls

1565
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:37,141
必须马上付钱给我的手下
My guys need to be paid

1566
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,601
不然他们就要停工
<i>They are going to stop work</i>

1567
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,563
戴维 我知道你们重新包装子弹的
David, I know the real reason

1568
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,440
真正目的
that you want ammunition repacked

1569
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:50,571
恩维尔 你听我说
Okay, look, Enver Listen to me

1570
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,031
我现在要马上飞回迈阿密 过一个星期就回来
I gotta fly to Miami right now
I'll be back in a week

1571
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:54,199
我向你保证
But I promise you,

1572
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:55,367
我下飞机后做的第一件事
the first thing that
I'm going do when I land

1573
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:57,703
就是确保把你们的钱打过来 好吗?
is make sure
you get your money wired, okay?

1574
01:31:01,457 --> 01:31:02,458
好的
Okay

1575
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:08,630
戴维
David

1576
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,215
去机场
Airport, let's go

1577
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:12,968
戴维
David

1578
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,721
我要赶去坐飞机 下个星期就回来
Look, I'm late for a flight
I'll be back next week

1579
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:17,973
她说她丈夫昨晚没回家
She said her husband
didn't come home last night

1580
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:21,768
好吧 你想让我帮你什么?
Okay, what do you want me to do?

1581
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,983
她非常担心 因为他平常不会这样
She's very worried It is not like him

1582
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,360
告诉她 我不认识她丈夫
Tell her I don't know her husband

1583
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:31,570
你丈夫是谁?
Who's your husband?

1584
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,697
巴什基姆
Bashkim

1585
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,044
没人再收到任何关于巴什基姆的消息
<i>No one ever heard
from Bashkim again</i>

1586
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,631
没有留言 也没找到尸体
<i>They never found a note,
they never found a body</i>

1587
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,342
他就这么人间蒸发了
<i>He just fell off the planet</i>

1588
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,889
我受够阿尔巴尼亚了
<i>I was done with Albania</i>

1589
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:02,100
我再也不会回去了
<i>I was never going back</i>

1590
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:13,362
嗨
Hi

1591
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:15,822
嘿
Hey

1592
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:20,202
我回阿尔巴尼亚的原因是重新包装那批子弹
The reason I went to Albania
was to repackage Chinese ammunition

1593
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,205
将它们的真实产地进行伪装 然后再卖给美国政府
so we could disguise it
and sell it to the US government

1594
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,167
这听起来好像不合法
That sounds illegal

1595
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,920
是的 但一切都结束了
It is But I'm done

1596
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:33,465
我发誓不管接下来发生什么
I swear, no matter what happens
for the rest of my life

1597
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:35,384
我永远都不会再向你撒谎了
I'm never going to lie to you again

1598
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:42,683
好吧
Mmm-hmm

1599
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:45,561
我真的好爱你 伊兹
I love you so much, Iz

1600
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,821
你的鼻子怎么了?
What happened to your nose?

1601
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:59,032
我被阿尔巴尼亚的黑帮绑架了
I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters

1602
01:32:59,825 --> 01:33:02,578
应该是骨折了 - 我的天啊
- I think it's broken
- Oh, my God

1603
01:33:05,956 --> 01:33:08,458
我打算重新做回按摩理疗师
I think I'm going to go back
to being a massage therapist

1604
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,043
可以吗?
Is that okay?

1605
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,589
可以
Yes

1606
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,843
只要你回来就好
It was always okay

1607
01:33:41,867 --> 01:33:43,368
嘿 你回来了
Hey, you're back

1608
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:55,964
喔!
Whoa!

1609
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:58,383
兄弟 你回来干什么?你的脸怎么了?
Bro, what are you doing back?
What happened to your face?

1610
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:00,552
这上面有截止到今天所有送往阿富汗的货物
That's everything that's been delivered
on the Afghan deal

1611
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:01,887
我想要我那部分的钱 我不干了
I want my cut I'm out

1612
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:04,765
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1613
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:07,351
他拿了一把枪抵着我的头
He put a fucking gun to my head, man

1614
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:08,894
谁 亨利吗?
Who, Henry?

1615
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,687
你说过不会乱来的
You said that you were going
to leave it alone

1616
01:34:12,606 --> 01:34:14,232
噢 该死
Oh, fuck

1617
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:17,694
是我的错
I fucked up

1618
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:20,072
我不干了 埃佛隆
I'm done, Efraim

1619
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,282
听着 你其实不用回来的
Look, you don't have to go back

1620
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:23,867
我雇了一个新人伊万
I hired this new guy, Ivan

1621
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:25,911
他会说阿尔巴尼亚语 - 我不干了
- He speaks Albanian
- I'm done

1622
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:34,461
怎么你觉得我身边有4百万闲钱可以随时给你?
What, do you think
I just got 4 million bucks laying around?

1623
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:36,046
我已经想过了
I've thought it through

1624
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:38,215
我要分4成
I'll take 40 cents on the dollar

1625
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,223
我也想过了
Yeah, I thought it through too

1626
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:47,766
这样如何?
How about this?

1627
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:49,893
你一成都别想分?
How about zero cents on the dollar?

1628
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:53,146
我提醒你 我们可是有合约的
Let me remind you that we have a contract

1629
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:54,690
去你妈的合约!
Fuck your contract!

1630
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:56,441
如果我请你帮我建一栋房子
If I asked you to build me a house,

1631
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,151
这房子才刚完成一半 你却告诉我你要退出
and you quit after building me
half a house,

1632
01:34:58,402 --> 01:34:59,653
你觉得我要付你那一半的钱吗?
you think I owe you half the money?

1633
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,905
你觉得这很好玩吗 戴维?
<i>Is this a fucking joke, David?</i>

1634
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:04,616
给你两个星期的时间 否则到时候给你打电话的就是我的律师了
You have two weeks
Otherwise, you'll hear from my lawyer

1635
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:06,827
谁 沃伦吗?
- Who, Warren?

1636
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:09,454
你说的是沃伦吗?他也是我的律师
Are you talking about Warren?
He's my lawyer too

1637
01:35:09,663 --> 01:35:10,831
还是我把他介绍给你的
<i>I introduced you to him</i>

1638
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:12,916
该死的沃伦
<i>Fucking Warren</i>

1639
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:24,594
操!
<i>Fuck!</i>

1640
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:52,122
这里是AEY 请问你找谁?
<i>AEY
How may I direct your call?</i>

1641
01:35:53,202 --> 01:35:57,122
*如果我真想要你的命 你早就死了*

1642
01:36:03,228 --> 01:36:06,730
*三个月后*

1643
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:16,730
我们战斗
We fight

1644
01:36:18,482 --> 01:36:19,858
为了家人
Fight with our families,

1645
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,818
为了我们的合作伙伴
fight with our business associates

1646
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,113
有时也为了我们的朋友
Sometimes we fight with our friends

1647
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:26,406
如果上帝在场
If God were here,

1648
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:27,949
我们也会为他而战
we'd probably fight with Him too

1649
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:35,290
埃佛隆对于发生的事情非常抱歉
Efraim has a heavy heart
over what's happened

1650
01:36:37,918 --> 01:36:41,421
恕我直言 拉夫尔 但我感觉 你可能还没认清他的真面目
No offense, Ralph, but I'm not sure
you've ever met the real Efraim

1651
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,800
他是很复杂的年轻人
He's a complicated young man

1652
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,761
但他只是想和你坐下来好好谈谈
But he just wants to sit down and talk

1653
01:36:48,345 --> 01:36:49,805
他想和你和解
Find a fair solution

1654
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:53,225
所以他叫我来帮忙调解
He's asked me to mediate

1655
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,147
让我帮帮你们吧 戴维
Let me help you, David

1656
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:03,401
我不知道我准备好没有
I just don't know
if I'm ready yet

1657
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:04,653
他来了
All right, here he is

1658
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:15,997
嘿 兄弟
Hey, bro

1659
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:19,918
很高兴见到你
Good to see you

1660
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:29,511
抱歉发生了这么多事情
Sorry things have gotten so crazy

1661
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:31,721
我也是
Yeah Me too

1662
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,557
需要点什么餐吗?
You having anything, hon?

1663
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:35,809
给我一杯咖啡就好 谢谢
I'll just have a coffee Thanks

1664
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:39,980
我想了很久
I've thought about it a lot

1665
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:44,609
还是觉得不能让你就这么两手空空地离开
And I don't want you to walk away
from this empty-handed

1666
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:46,820
好啊
Cool

1667
01:37:47,028 --> 01:37:49,614
所以我让沃伦起草了一份离职合同
So I had Warren draft up
a severance agreement

1668
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:51,283
我觉得挺公平的
And I think it's pretty fair

1669
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,413
我准备在接下来的4年里每年付给你5万块
I'm prepared to pay you 50K per year
for the next four years

1670
01:37:58,832 --> 01:38:00,041
也就是20万?
200 grand?

1671
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:04,504
你是在开玩笑吗?
Is this a fucking joke, man?

1672
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,092
这就是你所谓的调解?
Is this what you meant by mediation?

1673
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:10,552
因为你们既没有签订合同
In all fairness, there was never

1674
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,721
也没有签订合伙协议 所以这已经算不错的了
a partnership agreement,
no prior contract

1675
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:16,975
我有比合伙协议更好的东西
Yeah I have something better
than a partnership agreement

1676
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:18,977
我有证据
I have proof

1677
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:21,688
在我离开阿尔巴尼亚之前 我把所有东西都拿走了
Before I left Albania, I took everything

1678
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:22,898
什么鬼
What the fuck

1679
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:25,817
所有我们伪造的文件 还有重新包装子弹的照片
All the documents we forged,
photos of repacking

1680
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,068
戴维! - 重新包装?
- David!
- Repacking?

1681
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:28,528
他没告诉你吗? - 戴维!
- He didn't tell you?
- David!

1682
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:30,113
对了 我们拿你投资的钱
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1683
01:38:30,322 --> 01:38:33,158
买了1亿发非法中国造子弹
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1684
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:36,202
然后重新包装之后再卖给美国军队
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the US Military

1685
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,080
但我们从中获利了8百万 混蛋
Yeah, and we made
$8 million doing it, asshole

1686
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:40,290
小心点 埃佛隆
Careful, Efraim

1687
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:41,917
我们报给拉尔夫的数字可只有3百万
We told Ralph we only made
$3 million on that one

1688
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,126
等等 你说什么?
Wait, what now?

1689
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,961
他每个月寄给你的财务报告都是伪造的
He sends you fake accounting
reports every month

1690
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,838
噢 你去死 - 是我用笔记本合成的
- Oh, fuck off
- I make them on my laptop

1691
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:48,340
你完全是在胡说八道
Now you're just making shit up

1692
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,717
真的吗?所有的证据我都有 你个蠢驴!
Really? Because I kept everything,
you dumb fuck!

1693
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:53,553
我甚至还留有我们合成并寄给政府的
I even have copies of the bank statements
that we photoshopped

1694
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:54,804
银行结单的复印件
and sent to the government

1695
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:57,098
别他妈说了
Get the fuck out of here

1696
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,101
我能毁了你
I can bury you

1697
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,024
是我们
Us

1698
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:10,362
我想你要说的应该是
I think you meant to say,

1699
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:12,864
你能毁了我们
you can bury us

1700
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,202
因为所有牵扯到我的事
Because anything that implicates me,

1701
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:18,870
跟你都脱不了干系
implicates you as well

1702
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,205
埃佛隆 等等 - 不不不
- Efraim, wait
- No, no, no

1703
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:23,959
我今天来本身打算付给你20万
I came here today prepared
to pay you $200,000

1704
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,505
但现在我连早餐的钱都不会付
Now I'm not even going to pay
for breakfast

1705
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,851
噢 现在你在干嘛呀?嗯?
Oh What's going on over here? Huh?

1706
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,061
哪位?
Hello?

1707
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:45,105
我能和戴维・佩豪斯通话吗?
<i>May I speak with David Packouz?</i>

1708
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,315
我就是你是哪位? - 嗨戴维
- Yeah, who's this?
<i>- Hi, David</i>

1709
01:39:47,524 --> 01:39:50,610
我是《纽约时报》的齐福思
<i>This is C J Chivers
with</i>The New York Times

1710
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:53,446
想占用你几分钟时间聊聊关于AEY的事情
<i>I was wondering if you had a minute
to talk about AEY,</i>

1711
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:56,950
还有关于非法重换中国造子弹包装的问题
<i>and the alleged repackaging
of Chinese ammunition</i>

1712
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,078
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about

1713
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:02,414
根据我所得到的线报现在国务院正在就此事
<i>Well, according to my source,
there's an ongoing investigation</i>

1714
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,581
进行调查
<i>at the State Department</i>

1715
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:05,458
所以我想从你这儿得到确认
<i>And I was hoping
to get some clarification--</i>

1716
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,887
戴维 事情听起来挺严重的
David, this sounds pretty serious

1717
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:19,389
我知道
Yeah, I know

1718
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,100
你可以给我叔叔打电话
Maybe you should call my uncle

1719
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:24,060
他是个律师
<i>The lawyer</i>

1720
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,647
天啊 好的
- Oh, my God Okay

1721
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:29,441
这是个好主意
That's a good idea

1722
01:40:33,737 --> 01:40:36,239
嘿 等我一下 我在大厅等你们
Hey, give me a minute
I'll meet you guys in the lobby

1723
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:47,709
你刚刚接到《纽约时报》的电话了?
You just get a call
from <i>The New York Times?</i>

1724
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:49,044
对
Yeah

1725
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:55,884
我也是
Me too

1726
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:03,892
知道吗 昨晚电视台有播《疤面煞星》
You know, <i>Scarface</i> was on TV last night,

1727
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:07,312
我一边看一边回想起我们小时候的时光
<i>and I was watching it and thinking about
when we were little</i>

1728
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,857
我们一起模仿一起说剧中台词的样子
and we used to do the lines
from the movie

1729
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,361
你是我最好的朋友 戴维
<i>You're my best friend, David</i>

1730
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:19,991
天啊 我真的搞砸了 不是吗?
God, I really fucked this up, didn't I?

1731
01:41:25,246 --> 01:41:26,915
我很抱歉 伙计
I'm sorry, bro

1732
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:33,463
哇
Wow

1733
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:36,049
你有不在演戏的时候吗?
Are you ever not acting, man?

1734
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:38,718
你这话什么意思?
What does that mean?

1735
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:41,262
你只是假装把我想听的话讲出来了而已
<i>You just tell me
what you think I want to hear,</i>

1736
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:42,472
因为《纽约时报》的人打电话过来
because <i>The New York Times</i> called,

1737
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,682
你怕我会透露什么信息给他们
and you're freaking out
that I might say something

1738
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:48,478
承认吧
Just admit it

1739
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:51,189
我们从来就不是好朋友
We were never best friends

1740
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:54,025
你只是在扮演我的好朋友这个角色罢了
You were just playing
the part of my best friend

1741
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:57,946
没错
Yeah

1742
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,622
昨晚电视上也根本没播《疤面煞星》
<i>Scarface</i> wasn't even on TV last night

1743
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:13,753
你真是个混蛋
You're such a piece of shit

1744
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:16,589
干! - 去你妈的
- Fuck!
- Fuck you

1745
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,676
操 - 小婊子
- Fuck
- Little bitch

1746
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:25,306
这倒节省我们不少时间
Well, that saves us a trip

1747
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,970
我们干过这么多非法的勾当
<i>Out of all the illegal shit we did,</i>

1748
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:07,015
向政府撒过这么多谎
<i>all the lies we told the government,</i>

1749
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:11,019
但到最后是什么把我们出卖了?
<i>in the end, the thing that did us in?</i>

1750
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:15,064
是的 我想联系国防部
Yes, I'm trying to reach
the Department of Defense, please

1751
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:18,860
埃佛隆没有付钱给为我们换盒子的人
<i>Efraim never paid the box guy</i>

1752
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,031
报案应该找谁?
To who do you report a crime?

1753
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:26,701
思维尔打电话给五角大楼之后
<i>After Enver called the Pentagon,</i>

1754
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:29,454
国务院随即展开了全面的调查
<i>the State Department launched
a full-scale investigation,</i>

1755
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:31,497
调查时间持续数月
<i>that went on for months</i>

1756
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:38,213
他们在拉尔夫的干洗店 工作日时逮捕了他
<i>They busted Ralph at one of his shops
in the middle of a work day</i>

1757
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:43,635
他当时害怕极了所以很快就同意协助警察调查
<i>He was horrified
and couldn't make a deal fast enough</i>

1758
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:49,098
关于他想帮助我和埃佛隆尽早和好的屁话
<i>All that bullshit about him wanting
to mediate a truce between Efraim and I</i>

1759
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:51,392
那都是假的
<i>It was a setup</i>

1760
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,186
对了 我们还拿你投给我们的钱
<i>Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,</i>

1761
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:56,105
去买了1亿发非法中国造子弹
<i>and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,</i>

1762
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:59,567
然后对它进行重新包装之后再卖给美国军队
<i>then we repackaged it
and sold it to the US Military</i>

1763
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:01,486
被他们抓了个现行
<i>They had us dead to rights</i>

1764
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,363
真是悲哀啊
<i>It was pathetic</i>

1765
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:07,784
在检查埃佛隆的电脑的时候
<i>While going through Efraim's computer,
they even found a to-do list that said,</i>

1766
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,078
"重新包装中国造子弹"
<i>"Repackage Chinese ammo"</i>

1767
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:13,498
今晚发生的故事让五角大楼为之一振
The story tonight
that has Pentagon officials scrambling

1768
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:18,586
究竟两个20多数的年轻人是如何搞定国防部大合同的?
How did two 20-something young men
land a big Pentagon contract?

1769
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:19,921
联邦特工于上周将两个人逮捕
<i>Federal agents arrested</i>

1770
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:21,923
并以售卖过期
<i>both men last week,
charging them with fraud</i>

1771
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:25,260
残次的中国造子弹给国防部的诈骗罪
<i>for selling outdated, defective
Chinese ammunition</i>

1772
01:44:25,468 --> 01:44:26,844
给其定罪
<i>to the Pentagon</i>

1773
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:29,973
埃佛隆因触犯超过70条罪行
<i>Efraim was charged
with over 70 federal crimes</i>

1774
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:32,558
被判入狱监禁4年
<i>and sentenced to four years in prison</i>

1775
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:37,772
我被判有罪被罚以7个月的软禁
<i>I pled guilty and was sentenced
to seven months house arrest</i>

1776
01:44:44,237 --> 01:44:47,407
国会将此阿富汗合同一案
<i>Congress called the Afghanistan contract
a case study</i>

1777
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:50,994
作为政府正确采购过程的反面教材
<i>in all that is wrong
with the government's procurement process</i>

1778
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:05,800
AEY要到2022年 才能再次投标联邦合同
<i>In 2022, AEY will be eligible once again
to bid on Federal contracts</i>

1779
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:17,812
过得怎么样?
How's it going?

1780
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,858
还行
It's okay

1781
01:45:23,443 --> 01:45:26,362
如果我真想要你的命 你早就死了
If I wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead

1782
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:33,244
现在没什么问题了
I guess it's going all right then

1783
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:35,747
请进
Come in

1784
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:43,963
你孩子还好吗?
How's your baby?

1785
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:45,631
是个女儿 对吧?
It's a girl, right?

1786
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,717
对 她很好
Yeah She's good

1787
01:45:48,468 --> 01:45:49,886
我有3个孩子
I got three

1788
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:52,221
都是女儿
All girls

1789
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:54,557
大家都说她们长大之后情况会好起来
They tell you it gets better

1790
01:45:54,766 --> 01:45:56,976
但这并不是真的情况 只会越来越糟
That's not true, it gets worse

1791
01:45:57,602 --> 01:45:59,228
所以我才这么喜欢跟军火打交道
That's why I like the arms business

1792
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:01,647
因为干这一行的没有女人
No women

1793
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:16,454
我想就阿尔巴尼亚的事表示抱歉
I want to apologize about Albania

1794
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:22,627
我收到的情报不太准确
I had bad information

1795
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:30,885
所以你把我塞进汽车后备箱 用枪指着我的头 只是个失误?
So you stuffed me in the trunk of a car
and shoved a gun in my face by mistake?

1796
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:32,136
是的
Yeah

1797
01:46:34,347 --> 01:46:37,433
我不是个坏人 但在某些情况下
I'm not a bad man,
but in certain situations,

1798
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:40,061
我会自问
I have to ask myself,

1799
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:43,648
如果是坏人 他会怎么做?
what would a bad man do?

1800
01:46:48,945 --> 01:46:51,864
我很感谢你在接受调查的时候没有供出我
I appreciate you leaving my name
out of your testimony

1801
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:55,034
我觉得没这个必要
I didn't really see
a reason to include it

1802
01:46:55,243 --> 01:46:56,744
但还是谢谢你
Yeah, but still

1803
01:46:59,122 --> 01:47:00,540
我能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you a question?

1804
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:02,333
当然
Sure

1805
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:08,464
我们在维加斯的21点牌桌上遇见
When we met in Vegas
at the blackjack table,

1806
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:10,591
真的是巧合吗?
was that a coincidence?

1807
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,220
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

1808
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:21,477
我能再问一个问题吗?
Can I ask you another question?

1809
01:47:23,271 --> 01:47:25,940
我在阿尔巴尼亚的司机失踪了
My driver in Albania went missing

1810
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,277
你知道他出什么事了吗?
Do you know what happened to him?

1811
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:46,752
这是我在"阿富汗问题"上赚到的最后一笔钱
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal

1812
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:52,925
都是给你的
It's for you

1813
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:09,775
不要再问问题了
No more questions
