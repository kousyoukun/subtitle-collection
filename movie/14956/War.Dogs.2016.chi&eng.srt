1
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,963
请！请！

2
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,091
对不起，我不说话阿！

3
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,770
停止！我不明白！

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,205
你现在明白了么？

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,763
这是一个杰里科941指着我的头。

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,250
你可以得到一个在黑市上为$ 300。

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,441
是啊。

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,041
这是一个非常可靠的武器。

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,002
我的名字是大卫Packouz。

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,407
而我是一个国际军火商。

11
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,727
你知道战争是什么？

12
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,362
他们会告诉你这是爱国，民主

13
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,080
或有关其他人的一些狗屎憎恨我们的自由。

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,287
但是你要知道它的的确确是？

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,530
你看到了什么？

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,446
来自阿肯色州的一个孩子做他的爱国义务，以捍卫自己的国家吗？

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,248
我看到一个头盔，阻燃手套，

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,408
防弹衣，和M16。

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,651
我见$ 17,500名。

20
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,971
这就是它的成本来装备一名美国士兵。

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,201
超过两百万士兵

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,289
在伊拉克和阿富汗作战。

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
它花费了美国纳税人每年$ 4.5十亿

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,284
只需交纳空调票据

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,130
对于这些战争。

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,248
这就是战争是关于什么的。

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,002
战争是一个经济体。

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,371
如果谁告诉你，否则

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,967
无论是在它的或愚蠢。

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,484
但我不知道呢。

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,726
那时候，我什么都不知道。

32
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,930
你不能在这里停车。

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,006
嗨，老兄。我只是在2150，岸先生得到了一个客户端。

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,846
我提前几分钟。

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,168
是吗？这是一个大门的社区。

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,526
你仍然不能在这里停车。

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,402
你可能不应该抽烟，在这里，无论是。

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,201
好的。谢谢。

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,480
有很多我可以说这个时期在我的生命

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,842
这将使上下文这个故事。

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,401
我可以告诉你如何

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,443
我一个学期后，退了学。

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,930
- 怎么就这么左四干什么？ - 它仍然疼痛。

44
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,481
吵了我的父母。

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,729
我无论怎样退出或来自六个不同的工作被解雇了。

46
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,527
- 而已。 - 好吧。在那里，我们走了。

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,326
但回过头来看，我认为需要理解的最重要的事情是

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,401
我完全失去了。

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,891
抱歉。它下跌。

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,884
这没关系，加里。

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,450
我才22岁

52
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,725
按摩丰富的迈阿密海滩花花公子一个小时75块钱。

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,324
但我受够了。

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,807
是时候改变狗屎。

55
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,362
我有一个大的想法。

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,405
我的计划是出售优质床单批发

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,523
在南佛罗里达州的所有养老院。

58
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,370
并有数百人。

59
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,609
- 那感觉真是柔软。 - 这应该。

60
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,087
这是埃及棉，400线程数。

61
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,011
我的意思是，这对机构使用的线路中几乎顶部。

62
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,722
我不知道。它似乎过高。

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,407
那么，在每单位$ 29日，它远远过量。

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,571
大卫，你知道在这里Hilldale居民的平均年龄？

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,046
呃，不，我不知道。

66
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,447
- 八十二岁。 - 哇。

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,846
你见过在一个82岁的老人皮肤？

68
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,168
你有没有感觉到呢？

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,289
是啊。其实，我是一个认证的按摩治疗师

70
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,124
和我的很多客户都是老人。

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,407
那么你应该知道。

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,410
这些表，

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,082
它会像羊绒包装蜥蜴。

74
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,971
你会做吗？

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,170
你会在包装的羊绒蜥蜴？

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,568
我猜不会。

77
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,127
那么，为什么你会指望我？

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,248
我的侄子。

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,285
他是很好的，对不对？

80
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,208
我已经沉没我一生的积蓄65案件溢价床单

81
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
但我忽略了一个关键因素。

82
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,646
没有人真正关心老人。

83
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,481
你为什么不只是卖他们回来？

84
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,251
它不工作，这样。我买了他们的大头。

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,525
我好性交。

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,165
你不是性交。

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,010
皮特的性交。

88
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,489
他死了。

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,967
神圣的狗屎。那是埃夫拉伊姆？

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,440
是啊。

91
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,048
我以为他还在洛杉矶。

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,926
我也是。

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,730
- 他是一位伟大的朋友。 - 谢谢。

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,205
他看上去是如此晒黑。

95
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,602
埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli是我最好的朋友，长大了。

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,808
但我没有见过他，因为他被运到生活与他在10年级的叔叔。

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,162
我想我们的父母希望保持我们相距甚远越好。

98
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,367
有没有在生命册目录。

99
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,767
我们不知道，如果我们正处在一个新的篇章，或故事的结束的开始。

100
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,847
这就是为什么我们每次翻页时间必须感激。

101
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,250
你回来只是为了这个？

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,761
他妈的不！我几乎不认识皮特。

103
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,849
我希望在这里见到你。

104
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,008
你知道你妈妈不会给我你的电话号码？

105
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,247
什么，你叫我的房子？

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,727
不，我他妈的她。

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,844
她还恨我，是吧？

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,485
是的，最有可能的。

109
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,205
我很想念你，兄弟。

110
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,521
我也是。

111
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,650
让我们去兜风。

112
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,927
呃...

113
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,009
我不能。我在4:00有一个客户端。

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,890
他妈的狗屎。取消它。

115
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,650
你的孩子在城里回来。

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,171
来吧！

117
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,926
那么，什么用LA，男人发生了什么？

118
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,121
你为什么回迁？

119
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,203
哦，你知道我是在为我的叔叔，对吗？

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,971
是的，我听说你一样，一炮经销商或什么的。

121
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,121
漂亮多了。我的意思是，

122
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,648
我们会在警方拍卖买缴获的武器和转售它们在互联网上。

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,841
凉。

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,801
这是很酷，直到我叔叔scumbagged我过去70隆重。

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,764
神圣的狗屎。七十盛大？

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,804
随你。他妈的他。我做了一屁股的债。

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,890
我决定，我会回来到迈阿密，开始了我自己的店。

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
凉。

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,811
呦，哪来的这家伙活？

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,162
这是一样，五分钟。你有什么地方你得是什么？

131
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,887
没有。

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,407
好吧。所以，我想不通这是雪上加霜。

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,807
你卖床单到养老院的事实

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,644
或者说你这个混蛋家伙了钱。

135
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,322
为了记录在案，我是有执照的按摩师，好吗？

136
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,851
完全合法的。

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,249
好的。但最终，球员都来了，对不对？

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,885
喜欢，在你的胸部或什么？

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,082
你知道吗？去你妈的。

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,089
去你妈的，哥们。

141
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,045
兄弟，你还记得我们去买杂草一起是什么时候？

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,288
我当然是了。这是他妈的创伤。

143
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,046
是的，但你还记得你的第二天，当我们走进学校

144
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,208
每个人都知道我们被逮捕？

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,323
是啊，我们是黑帮，兄弟。

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,841
我们认为，我们跑了南海滩。

147
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,849
我们没跑神学院。

148
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,849
我们没有把狗屎任何人。

149
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,646
是的，我错过了。

150
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,127
你错过了神学院？

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,129
不，我错过

152
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,522
没有任何人采取狗屎。

153
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,401
哟！

154
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,686
他出来。你在找杂草？

155
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,202
依靠。你有好东西？

156
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,364
这样说吧。我卖了他的狗屎。

157
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,644
什么跟这个黑人，男人了？

158
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,285
凉。你可以做一盎司？

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,767
是啊，无汗。三项法案。

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,211
三百。我喜欢。

161
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,721
您得到更好的价格，当你来到直接向分销商。

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,365
我猜是这样。

163
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,686
好吧。

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,401
呀，于是，她打开门。

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,289
而我想，“呦。寒意。我是不是那个电视剧。”

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,521
你知道我的意思？

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,881
“我知道你在摇篮另一个黑鬼”。

168
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,206
这是怎么回事？

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,201
什么？

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,285
我可以得到狗屎？

171
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,811
什么狗屎？

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,601
我只给你$ 300的一些杂草。

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,205
任你黑鬼见过这个混蛋过吗？

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,566
我是没见过狗屎。

175
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,202
男人，获得他妈的离开这里。

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,166
- 好吧。好吧，好吧。 - 是啊。

177
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,241
这个白人男孩疯狂。

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,726
降落伞裤。

179
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,485
看起来像杰雷诺和狗屎。

180
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,405
看起来他去教堂。

181
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,051
哟，哟，抱起来，抱起来，人。

182
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,526
- 什么他妈的。 - 妈的！

183
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,880
来吧！哪里是每个人去？

184
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,923
我以为我们会挂出。

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,525
什么是一群混蛋的。

186
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,490
什么他妈的是什么？你疯了吗？

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,641
这很酷，兄弟。

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,451
我有3类枪支许可证。

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,530
- 咦？ - 来吧，进去。

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,370
我知道附近的其他经销商。

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,286
有点奇怪。我们同岁，但我总是抬头埃夫拉伊姆。

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,726
当生活踢我，我留了下来。

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,083
但不是埃夫拉伊姆。他踢中后卫。

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,123
主席先生，我们要感谢你

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,731
今天我们参观这里。

196
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,207
我们很荣幸能服务于我们的国家，

197
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,044
和自豪地欢迎你，

198
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,447
我们的战时总司令...

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,762
- 嘿。 - 嘿，亲爱的。

200
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,610
怎么样的葬礼？

201
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,643
这是惊人的。

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,690
哦，我的上帝。你这样扔石头，不是吗？

203
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,450
咦？什么？

204
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,246
你刚才谈到的葬礼为“惊艳”。

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,727
什么？第葬礼是真的很伤心。

206
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,883
是啊，每个人都完全郁闷了。

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,401
但是，我遇到了我的朋友从成长。

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,841
这家伙我告诉你。埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli？

209
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,649
你被拘捕的人吗？

210
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,328
是啊。我的意思是，我们做了一些其他的东西太多，但...

211
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,722
无论如何，他刚刚搬回到迈阿密。

212
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,285
这是伟大的，对不对？

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,000
是啊。我认为他的办公室明天摆动。

214
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,770
我们要抢吃午饭。

215
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,324
- 好的。 - 你饿了吗？

216
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,760
- 嗯？ - 我太饿了。

217
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,641
- 我们没有太多在这里。 - 哦。

218
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,002
- 我的意思是，我们有比萨饼。 - 真的吗？

219
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,924
- 和玉米片。 - 我们有玉米片？

220
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,730
和冰淇淋。

221
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,207
等等，什么？我们从来没有冰淇淋。

222
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,049
你跟我他妈的，不是吗？

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,931
之所以如此，是平均值。

224
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,250
这是那么容易。

225
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,121
你好？

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,971
您好，先生克斯Borstein。这是大卫Packouz。

227
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,685
你告诉我今天打电话给在11:00。

228
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,521
我有那些床单有我，我很愿意为你去看看。

229
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,285
呃，先生，如果你给我机会

230
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,369
我相信，你的居民

231
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,971
将欣赏的差异。

232
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,921
这是我们无法自圆其说的开支，而我们只是不感兴趣。

233
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,366
嗯。

234
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,762
好了，好了，感谢您的时间。

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
是啊，这是合同专家

236
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,806
林赛迈克尔斯从陆军司令部，皮卡汀尼。

237
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,571
那就对了。

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,890
是啊，我发出了征集一些249s巴士拉

239
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,447
我们似乎已经错位您的文书工作。

240
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,642
大。所以，如果你能继续前进，只是重新给我发电子邮件这些数字。

241
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,047
其实，你知道吗？关于第二个想法，

242
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,890
我们即将就这些提案请求的决定。

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,367
你为什么不继续前进，只是给我出价，而我在这里遇到你的电话？

244
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,447
嗯。

245
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,245
而这是否包括弹匣？

246
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,088
大。是的先生。

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,200
你不断提供枪支，我们会继续杀死坏人。

248
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,285
上帝祝福你。

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,970
什么他妈的一个工具。这是怎么回事，兄弟？

250
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,367
呦，这是怎么回事，人呢？那是什么一回事呢？

251
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,682
哦，那是我冒充军官。

252
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,689
真？做什么的？

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,042
要找出我的竞争对手的合同竞标。

254
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,050
这是他妈的天才。

255
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,688
我还以为你说你卖一样，缴获的武器在互联网上枪坚果。

256
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,006
不再。

257
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,969
现在我只卖一个螺母枪。

258
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,531
哦耶？哪一个？

259
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,483
美国军方，狗娘养的。

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,010
想要做一个奉击？

261
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,606
漂亮生病了，是吧？

262
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,201
还等什么，你卖这些东西五角大楼？

263
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,767
我出售各种狗屎五角大楼。

264
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,725
枪支，子弹，防弹衣。

265
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,369
上周，我在伊拉克运400防毒面具美国特种部队。

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,881
没有狗屎。

267
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,523
你已经多久这样做呢？

268
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,245
两三个月。

269
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,408
你好好赚钱？

270
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,729
哦!他妈的，伙计。

271
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,725
这样说吧。我做了200K，在过去八个星期。

272
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,162
而我只能告诉你，因为你是我的孩子。

273
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,486
我不是吹牛。

274
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,085
神圣的狗屎。

275
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,725
是啊。看一下这个。

276
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,450
美联储商务哎呀代表联邦商业机会。

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,768
认为易趣，而是战争。

278
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
- 他们购买这里的坦克？ - 兄弟，他们买这里的一切。

279
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,521
这是疯了。

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,802
政府有一个公共网站

281
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,447
含每一项军事合约目前最高出价。

282
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,126
但我跳过大件商品，寻找小球狗屎

283
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,601
巨国防承包商忽视。

284
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,121
每个人的战斗在同一个馅饼。

285
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,845
但他们忽略了面包屑。

286
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,481
我住在面包屑，像老鼠。

287
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,328
而当你在处理与五角大楼，面包屑价值数百万。

288
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,321
这些列表似乎永远继续下去。

289
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,246
而根据埃夫拉伊姆，他们做到了。

290
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,402
谢啦。

291
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,241
所以，我不明白这一点。

292
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,090
如果有一个完整的国防工业，

293
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,124
为什么五角大楼想要买你的东西？

294
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,931
他们不希望，他们不得不这样做。

295
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,531
还记得小联盟？

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,604
怎么样，在本赛季结束后，他们会发出那么大MVP奖杯

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,165
而一个孩子会总是赢吗？

298
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,646
是啊，埃文塔尔博特。

299
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,286
对。但后来，一年下来，别人的妈妈抱怨？

300
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,802
然后，他们不得不给大家一个小奖杯，这样他们就不会心疼？

301
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,804
即使是脂肪智障的孩子，罗比・弗里德曼，得到了一个。

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,002
这有点像这里发生了什么。

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,284
我仍然困惑的男人。

304
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,643
五角大楼搞砸了，当他们重建伊拉克军队。

305
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,010
他们给这些没有竞标的合同，切尼的男生，他们被抓住了。

306
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,686
因此，布什开始了这一举措公平的竞争环境

307
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,322
现在每购买五角大楼，每枪，手榴弹每次，

308
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,246
每颗子弹，被提供给小企业的投标。

309
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,330
而且肯定的是，大狗仍然获得大奖杯。

310
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,847
但五角大楼的得给小奖杯

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
对世界上所有的罗比弗里德曼。

312
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,728
所以，基本上，你是一个胖孩子迟缓。

313
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,566
兄弟，我是最胖最迟钝。

314
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,568
在今天的演讲中，布什总统说，相反的报告

315
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,684
他没有攻打伊朗的计划。

316
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,571
总统说，“这是荒谬的。

317
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,081
“我们甚至还没有计划时，我们打伊拉克。”

318
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,161
大卫。

319
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,521
是吗？

320
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,887
还记得几个星期前，在汽车上的家离我妈妈的房子的方式吗？

321
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,367
是。是的，我愿意。

322
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,486
好了，这件事发生。

323
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,164
如何他妈的你打算喂养婴儿？

324
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,170
你有没有想过这一点？

325
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,361
你会怎样做？

326
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,085
混蛋男人把你的余生？

327
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,841
是的，就是这个计划。我会被急拉断男人养活我的孩子。

328
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,566
抱歉。

329
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,723
好的。嗯，至少你认为它通过。

330
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,445
这不好笑。

331
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,601
老兄，我这么性交。

332
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,928
我想你应该为我来的工作。

333
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,890
你在说什么？

334
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,003
说真的，我所需要的帮助。

335
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,326
大卫看着我。

336
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,168
布什在伊拉克打开了闸门。

337
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,210
这是一个他妈的淘金热。

338
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,171
这是非常好的你，埃夫拉伊姆。

339
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,203
他妈的太好了！谁在乎好看？

340
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,368
我一直在寻找把别人上一段时间了。

341
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,040
问题是，我不相信任何人。

342
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,530
但你是我的孩子。

343
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,127
我的意思是，没有犯罪，但我反对这场战争。

344
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,041
我和IZ打算集会和请愿签名。

345
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,890
是啊，老兄，我是反对战争了。

346
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,605
我他妈的恨布什。

347
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,205
但是，这不是关于是支持战争。

348
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,448
战争正在发生。

349
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,688
这是一个关于是亲钱。

350
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,770
更埃夫拉伊姆聊过，它越有意义。

351
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,928
此外，相比于我的其他前景，

352
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,487
这是一个千载难逢的机会。

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,287
我唯一的问题是，我会告诉IZ？

354
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,568
我认为这是一个好主意。

355
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,565
所以，我撒谎了。

356
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,525
你知道，我一直在这个行业相信。

357
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,726
我告诉她，有埃夫拉伊姆在政府巨大的联系。

358
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,485
而不是卖床单

359
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,808
以吝啬养老院

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,480
我们现在会卖片到自由消费，

361
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,768
资金过剩美军。

362
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,530
这是天才。

363
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,769
我只好撒谎。 IZ痛恨战争。

364
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,965
她有两个表兄弟在伊拉克服役。

365
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,525
她还恨那个被占用了一半的公寓床单的山。

366
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,204
我在处理武器速成班在接下来的六个星期。

367
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,323
在赫斯塔尔556轻机枪。

368
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,727
比利时，但在很多地方下发许可证。

369
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,725
当它来到这个狗屎，埃夫拉伊姆什么都知道了。

370
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,089
制造，型号，重量，它被制成。

371
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,965
请记住，还有的是天安门事件以来对中国的武器禁运。

372
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,081
而如果有要播放的角度，他知道这一点。

373
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,362
你有这个东西的字里行间。

374
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,171
所有的钱都被字里行间的。

375
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,286
我会花我整天淘政府网站，

376
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,161
搜索忽视的合同，我们可以挤压我们的方式进入。

377
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,564
嘿，我觉得我得到的东西。

378
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,770
嘿，格鲁吉亚，我得给你回电话。

379
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,405
然后，在半夜

380
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,841
我们会回到办公室，工作电话。

381
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,361
锻造的关系

382
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,962
与武器制造商遍布东欧。

383
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,766
不，大卫Packouz来自AEY。

384
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,889
我告诉IZ我们正在做在巴基斯坦板材供应商的电话会议。

385
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,242
他们呼吁的家伙像我们这样的战争犬。

386
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,681
底部馈线谁赚钱战

387
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,087
没有在战场上永远踩着脚下。

388
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,162
它是贬义的，但我们还挺喜欢它。

389
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,125
你他妈的人渣一块狗屎！

390
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,484
淹没，混蛋，淹死！

391
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,041
非常好。

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,682
拉尔夫斯拉斯基是埃夫拉伊姆的沉默伙伴。

393
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,571
他是一名当地商人

394
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,809
谁拥有14干洗店全部横跨迈阿密。

395
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,930
为什么没人告诉我先生被打破？

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,929
拉尔夫出钱来支持这些交易，以换取该公司的25％。

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,327
或者至少是他以为是25％。

398
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,802
我们在做上帝的工作，拉尔夫。

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,809
我们真的是。

400
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,048
要知道，每一个犹太人欠的债到以色列。

401
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,846
在我看来，这不是一个隐喻的债务。

402
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,209
拉尔夫的印象是埃夫拉伊姆是一个细心的犹太人

403
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,851
谁只涉及武器的一种手段

404
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,963
以保护以色列不受她的敌人。

405
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,804
精美的说。

406
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,447
你碰巧赶上上周五的Torah部分？

407
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,286
- 我最喜欢的之一。 - 同样在这里。

408
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,086
这让我想起这个故事我曾经读过的。

409
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,965
关于一个年轻男子前往平斯克。

410
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,647
这是埃夫拉伊姆的天才。

411
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,202
他会找出谁有人希望他成为

412
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,290
他会成为那种人。

413
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,646
啊!

414
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,441
和他有一样，他们中的20,000。

415
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,290
大。你在哪里找到这个家伙？

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,568
你还记得维克多乌克兰？

417
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,046
是的，一个具有Mk3s？

418
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,204
是啊。他使我对这个公司在塞浦路斯。

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,801
它是由这家伙，亨利・吉拉德运行。

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,081
亨利吉拉德？

421
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,446
是啊，你认识他吗？

422
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,722
你说亨利吉拉德？

423
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,167
一些时间。为什么？他是谁？

424
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,887
好家伙，过去20年来，这家伙已经基本供应

425
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,447
地球上的每个冲突双方。

426
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,165
他是一个他妈的动物。

427
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,045
真？他为什么给我打电话？

428
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,129
因为他是一个他妈的动物。

429
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,171
这是所有的钱，它的所有事项。

430
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,124
嘿，真身，你要去哪里？

431
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,364
我试图找到我的朋友。

432
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,886
你要赚一些钱？

433
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,241
对不起？

434
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,847
我给你$ 1,000现在

435
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,929
如果我们快进到我们的第三次约会。

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,691
这是什么意思，甚至？

437
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,248
这意味着我们只是有一个伟大的晚餐，也许满足你的朋友的一些饮料

438
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,249
现在你要打击我在我的车。

439
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,805
我们能不能得到正确的那部分？

440
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,451
谁他妈的是你吗？

441
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,005
埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli。

442
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,281
这是我最好的朋友，大卫。

443
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,084
而且我们的国际军火商。

444
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,406
不过你已经知道，

445
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,409
因为我们对我们的第三次约会。

446
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,124
- 这是怎么回事？ - 没什么，兄弟。

447
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,970
我即将离开这里与我的女孩。

448
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,684
什么他妈的，男人！

449
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,363
哦，我的上帝。

450
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,363
那家伙不是他妈的左右。

451
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,728
是啊，你应该选择了一个不同的女孩。

452
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,526
他妈的说，它几乎工作。

453
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,442
嘿，你还记得你上六年级的战斗埃里克Moscowitz？

454
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,047
是啊，他这样做风车的事情与他的怀里。

455
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,208
这是症状越严重。他是不可战胜的。

456
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,890
你还记得那些歌？

457
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,125
而已。

458
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,243
好家伙，他会杀了我，如果你没有在跳。

459
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,530
大概。嗯。

460
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,685
嘿，我从来不说“谢谢”。

461
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,924
对于一切。

462
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,123
来吧，你知道你有多少帮了我最近。

463
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,604
这个很酷。你不必做很奇怪，没事吧？

464
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,130
嘿，我们可以订购一些食物？

465
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,483
真身，来吧。我本来可以去古巴和背部。

466
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,569
满足家庭，抓住了几个三明治。

467
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,886
我现在已经完成。

468
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,281
你好？

469
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,323
是的先生。对不起，我没想到工作呼叫这么晚。

470
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,091
对，当然。这是上午9:00巴格达。

471
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,721
是谁？

472
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,122
这是个好消息，队长桑托斯。

473
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,526
是的先生。

474
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,966
我们将马上上。

475
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,241
谢谢。再见。

476
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,441
什么？

477
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,321
我们刚刚得到了贝雷塔的交易。

478
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,766
获得他妈的离开这里。

479
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,281
我向上帝发誓。

480
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,363
贝雷塔交易是巨大的。

481
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,360
这是比任何事情到目前为止，我们会关闭大10倍。

482
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,562
这是一个新的水平狗屎。

483
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,410
这就是我他妈的说什么！

484
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,967
这是真正的钱，混蛋！他妈的！

485
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,369
你知道，我们要作出600K

486
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,891
在这他妈的事情吗？

487
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,121
神圣的狗屎。

488
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,086
大卫，你的30％，为$ 180,000元。

489
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,403
圣臭狗屎！

490
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
这是惊人的。

491
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,890
我一直用工作埃夫拉伊姆两个月

492
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,162
并且已经大约赚更多的钱

493
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,124
比按摩的一生。

494
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,881
听。

495
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,206
那是什么？

496
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,845
这就是你的宝宝的心跳。

497
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,807
哇。

498
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,243
你能相信它的速度有多快？

499
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,328
- 这是否正常？ - 完全正常。

500
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,490
胎儿有更快的速度心脏比我们做的。

501
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,401
看。

502
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,281
所以，你们想知道的性别？

503
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,530
我们不断来回就可以了。

504
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,083
- 你有什么感想？ - 嗯...

505
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,009
这是工作。我不得不把它。

506
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,281
我很抱歉。

507
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,646
这是大卫。

508
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,649
这是桑托斯上尉在巴格达

509
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,002
检查我的Berettas的交货状态。

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,924
队长，好从你的来信。

511
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,288
是的，我们目标。都好。

512
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
大。我很担心

513
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,601
这些枪来直接出意大利。

514
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,882
绝对。他们是的，先生。

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,082
Packouz，请告诉我

516
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,931
你知道意大利上周通过的立法。

517
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,801
一个禁止所有武器运到伊拉克。

518
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,931
我根本不知道他在说什么。

519
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,851
但是，这是一个巨大的他妈的问题。

520
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,889
Berettas是一个意大利的枪。

521
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,890
制成，并在意大利制造。

522
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,121
呃...

523
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,646
当然。

524
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,251
我是。我一直在手机上

525
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,403
过去三天，做其他安排。

526
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,285
大。这就是我想听到的。

527
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,926
伊拉克警察部队取决于你。

528
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,361
嗯，你告诉他们AEY已经得到了他们所覆盖。

529
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,291
- 突出。 - 谢谢你，队长。一会再聊。

530
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,090
一切都好？

531
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,481
是啊。是的，一切都很好。

532
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,209
发生了什么？我们已经做了什么？

533
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,085
是啊。你猜怎么了？

534
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,885
这是一个女孩。

535
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,121
宝宝。

536
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,725
好的。至少我碰到了什么东西。

537
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,843
说真的，什么他妈的我们该怎么办？

538
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,810
放松，兄弟。

539
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,247
我是不是应该给他回电话，告诉他真相？

540
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,491
什么时候说的是实话曾经帮助别人吗？

541
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,648
埃夫拉伊姆，我们不能家伙这个家伙周围

542
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,927
然后不给。

543
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,566
我们要交付。我已经想通了。

544
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,847
我们用乔丹。

545
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,766
乔丹戈德法布？

546
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,961
约旦...

547
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,525
约旦国家。

548
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,161
这股与伊拉克的边界。这是美国的盟友。

549
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,966
而最重要的，没有禁运。

550
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,129
好了，我们怎么告诉意大利人？

551
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,129
他妈的他们！至于他们而言

552
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,603
他们在5000发送到Berettas他们有没有问题的国家。

553
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,087
我们所要做的就是船炮

554
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,004
从约旦到巴格达。

555
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,651
这就是所谓的规避。

556
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,201
这是否合法？

557
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,486
这不是非法的。

558
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,761
想试试吗？

559
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,406
该慈善机构的事情怎么走？

560
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,931
这是5K，对不对？

561
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,770
它应该是一个5K。

562
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,008
呃，我完成了约1的K吧。

563
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,248
所以，我也许应该退回的钱五分之四。

564
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,850
所以，安德鲁告诉我

565
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,361
你和埃夫拉伊姆现在一起工作？

566
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,881
真？

567
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,969
是啊，我告诉她关于纸张的事情。

568
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,648
是啊。埃夫拉伊姆与政府的一些接触。

569
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,889
所以，我们只是现在强强联合。

570
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,401
是啊，只是......只是要小心他。

571
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,568
- 艾米丽，不要。 - 什么？

572
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
你是什??么意思？

573
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,891
那么，他的表妹，丽贝卡，是我的一个老朋友。

574
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,451
我们去露营在一起。

575
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,008
她告诉我，他从她的父亲偷了$ 7万人。

576
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,725
哇，真的吗？

577
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,961
那很有意思。

578
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,730
其实，我听说这是周围的其他方式。

579
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,566
他的叔叔是谁从他那里偷了钱的人。

580
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,040
看到？你不知道。

581
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,571
每个人都有自己的故事版本。

582
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,325
不，我敢肯定。

583
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,409
他们全家停止了它跟他说话。

584
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,450
哟！你为什么不回答你的电话吗？

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,291
嘿，这是怎么回事，人呢？

586
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,161
他妈的是什么？

587
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,489
每个人，这是大卫的贸易伙伴，埃夫拉伊姆。

588
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,843
- 嗨，老兄。 - 嗨，老兄。

589
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,690
兄弟，我能和你聊外面一分钟？

590
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,405
- 这很紧急。 - 嗯，当然咯。

591
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,447
并记录在案，我也是他最好的朋友，

592
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,166
所以也许应该被邀请到任何这是。

593
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,445
你看，这些都是她的朋友。这是她的晚宴。

594
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,768
罗森是她的朋友呢？这他妈的犹太人？

595
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
相信我，你不想在这里。

596
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,771
我不希望到这里来，行吗？

597
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,521
现在，这是怎么回事？

598
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,444
约旦海关查获我们Berettas。

599
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,962
- 什么？为什么？ - 我不知道他妈的，大卫。

600
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,089
我从高中辍学，他们涵盖国际外交了。

601
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,761
- 那是谁？ - 操，这是桑托斯。

602
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,007
他知道！

603
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,006
把它捡起来，我要听。

604
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,646
- 选择......拿起手机他妈的。 - 这是大卫。

605
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,161
是啊，我刚才听到我的枪是在约旦举行的。

606
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,370
桑托斯队队长，是的，有过轻微的打嗝。

607
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,891
它们是什么做的，即使在约旦？

608
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,121
不用担心。

609
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,687
他们在安曼一个机库。完全安全的。

610
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,571
我和我的团队现在正在研究解决方案。

611
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,285
你没有回答我的问题。

612
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,289
什么他妈的是我的枪在约旦做什么？

613
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,243
桑托斯队队长，这是埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli。

614
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,090
AEY公司总裁，先生。

615
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,290
大卫已告知我的情况，我们正在寻找的选择，因为我们说话。

616
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,720
选择？什么样的选择？

617
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,891
那么，你熟悉的大嘴TP1 9？

618
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,048
这是巴西，它是狗屎。

619
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,481
合同说Berettas，我想Berettas。

620
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,762
主席先生，我需要你与我们合作一点点这个。

621
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,961
让我说清楚。

622
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,491
我在世界的屁股裂缝，捍卫你的自由。

623
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,603
和我同你狗屎袋工作？

624
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,041
你看，我不知道

625
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,171
如果这些Berettas真的在安曼或者如果你只是想鹅您的利润

626
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,569
就像你惨了，老鼠他妈的界每隔一块狗屎。

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,366
无论哪种方式，你在危及我的使命。

628
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,607
我关闭你失望。

629
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,484
我取消你的事业。

630
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,244
入门取消原因是判了死刑。

631
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,051
这意味着我们永远不会赢得另一份合同。

632
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,770
上尉，请不要这么做。

633
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,731
我知道你很烦恼。

634
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,843
但是，从一个基督徒另一

635
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,129
我的妻子和我有严重的财政问题。

636
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,370
我们的儿子，卢卡斯，是在医院里。

637
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,767
医疗费用是通过屋顶。

638
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,205
如果你这样做，它会毁了我。它会毁了我的家庭。

639
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,521
正如上帝为我作证，

640
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,648
我将让你你的枪。

641
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,841
你好？

642
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,767
什么他妈的一块狗屎！你相信这他妈的家伙？

643
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,240
- 他妈的。 - 这是怎么回事？

644
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,729
什么枪，大卫？

645
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,443
你他妈的在开玩笑吗？

646
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,200
你告诉我你们在卖床单。

647
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,210
是啊，我还告诉你，我们也卖其他的东西。

648
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,164
我以为你说的枕头！

649
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,371
你看，我不能给予按摩支持孩子。

650
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,369
好的？没有人在买床单。

651
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,164
不，大卫，你骗我。

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
因为我知道你是怎么想的战争。

653
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,563
我想我们都觉得这种方式！

654
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,170
我怀孕五个月了！

655
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,249
而且它的，如果我不能信任的人有问题

656
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,521
我有一个孩子了！

657
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,848
- 当然，你可以信任我。 - 真的吗？

658
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,805
因为五分钟前，我甚至不知道你是军火商！

659
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,605
我不是一个军火商。

660
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,330
我们做的是完全合法的。

661
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,768
我们为政府工作。我们是中间商。

662
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,167
我们不碰枪，我们没有看到炮声。

663
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,647
我们甚至从来没有离开办公室。

664
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,444
嘿，不好意思打断。这是时间敏感的。

665
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,806
大卫，你有护照？

666
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,529
什么？是的为什么？

667
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,961
我们必须去约旦。就像，尽快。

668
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,571
拉直这狗屎了。

669
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,205
我们得说话，不管，好吗？

670
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,601
是啊。

671
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,041
哟，你的窗口或过道？

672
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,043
- 对不起，对不起。 - 是的，我们刚刚降落。

673
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,850
- 对不起。 - 使馆打电话？

674
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,731
对不起。好的再见。

675
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,050
- 对不起，那种紧急情况。 - 对不起。抱歉。

676
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,969
别担心，我得先走了。我是美国人。

677
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,321
对不起。

678
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,969
美国大使馆提供很少或几乎没有帮助

679
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
在处理与海关部。

680
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,888
因此，我们采取了事态到我们自己的手中。

681
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,729
他说，您的许可证已过期

682
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,406
而且你不能飞你的箱子从约旦河而不之一。

683
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,204
是的，我们知道。这就是为什么我们在这里。

684
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,082
你看，我们被告知，你认识的人在政府，

685
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,165
这也许可以帮助我们。

686
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,971
他说，这将需要六周的时间来获得新的许可证。

687
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,003
是啊，这是个问题。我们没有六个星期。

688
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,770
我们今天需要我们的枪。

689
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,411
你看，我不想摘下来的丑陋的美国人在这里。

690
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,161
也许我不明白你的文化的仪式

691
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,691
但这种感觉就像一瞬间

692
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,848
我们都应该向他提供一份礼物，我是正确的？

693
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,770
- 你是对的。 - 好吧。

694
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,362
$ 1,400所美国很酷？

695
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,361
帅气的男人。

696
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,684
本来刚开始，你知道，保存所有这些废话。

697
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,881
我喜欢你的阴影。

698
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,770
告诉他我给他100块钱的色调。

699
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,166
告诉他在胡言乱语。

700
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,969
没门。鳄鱼。

701
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,049
对，我知道。一世...

702
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,806
这是鳄鱼。它实际上是一只鳄鱼。

703
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,964
我喜欢花哨的狗屎，那是我的事。

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,611
告诉他。

705
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,084
整整三天，我们什么也没听见。

706
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,245
这是荒谬的。

707
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,525
我们的整个业务是骑在一个11岁的翻译的话。

708
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,443
混蛋！他撕开我们送行！

709
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,811
我们不知道呢。

710
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,207
没有！我知道是什么感觉喜欢他妈的某人。

711
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,641
我也知道这是什么感觉的话，被人性交。

712
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,251
而我们刚刚性交。

713
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,887
你需要冷静下来。

714
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,724
我怎么冷静下来，大卫？

715
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,241
我们正处在一个穆斯林国家，我甚至无法获得口交！

716
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,005
太丢脸了！

717
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,161
这是乱来了！他妈的！

718
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,201
是啊。

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,001
马上？

720
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,525
我们下来。

721
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,290
这是阿拉丁。他们在大厅。

722
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,721
看到了吗？来吧。

723
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,081
坚持，稍等。你他妈的在开玩笑吗？

724
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,321
有什么问题？

725
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,888
你想你的枪后，他拿到了你的枪回来。

726
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,402
什么？不，我们说我们需要一个允许他们飞到伊拉克。

727
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,082
没错，但你并不需要许可证来驱动它们。

728
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,604
你希望我们给他们开车到伊拉克？

729
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,085
为什么不？万宝路是所有乔丹的最佳走私犯。

730
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,561
谁，这一点？

731
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,406
这是所有乔丹的最佳走私？

732
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,725
是啊，他开车到巴格达三，每月四次。

733
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,206
埃夫拉伊姆，你想在这里有多重？

734
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,408
呦，它有多远巴格达？

735
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,451
- 为什么你要问他了吗？ -  800公里。

736
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,846
他知道自己在做什么？

737
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,446
埃夫拉伊姆，停止。

738
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,608
-  100％最好。 - 来吧。

739
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,684
这就像500英里。我们将从早上在那里。

740
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,360
你认真想开车到巴格达？

741
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,331
大卫，我们gunrunners。

742
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,325
让我们去运行一些他妈的枪。

743
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,961
我们走吧。

744
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,765
来吧。

745
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,361
嘿，说真的，这是安全的？驾车前往巴格达？

746
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,528
是的，很安全。

747
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,767
50-50。

748
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,561
50-50？我们死了什么，像50％我们的生活，50％？

749
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,604
是。这就是为什么我们通过夜间驾驶。

750
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,845
它是更安全。

751
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,245
如何更安全？

752
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,720
50-50。

753
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,331
兄弟，什么他妈的！

754
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,484
很显然，他不知道是什么意思50-50。

755
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,081
哦，我的上帝。

756
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,130
嘿，关于气什么关系吗？这是一个漫长的旅程，不是吗？

757
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,490
没问题。汽油在伊拉克的自由。

758
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,166
别开玩笑了。

759
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,925
- 游离气？ - 是啊。

760
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,244
看到我在说什么？伊拉克涂料。

761
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,128
我想买一台地方出现。

762
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,080
游离气体。

763
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,369
他妈的凉爽，人。

764
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,001
那是什么？

765
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,321
什么？

766
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,405
你不明白吗？

767
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,925
什么他妈的？

768
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,765
嘿，你为什么放缓，男人呢？

769
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,321
没事的，没事的。

770
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,208
什么是好？

771
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,004
哇，哇。什么他妈的，兄弟？

772
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,486
没关系。边境。

773
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,081
这是什么？

774
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,206
他妈的。

775
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,641
- 耶稣。 - 放下。

776
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,001
- 咦？ - 放下。

777
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,487
哇，哇。

778
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,521
香烟。

779
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,685
为你。

780
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,401
欢迎。

781
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,283
它是超现实他妈的。

782
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,165
半年前，我在迈阿密海滩按摩治疗师。

783
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,330
而现在，在这里我是，驾驶枪的卡车

784
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,726
通过伊拉克沙漠

785
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,207
从初中我最好的朋友。

786
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,209
万宝路？

787
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,411
嘿，万宝路？

788
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,441
兄弟！

789
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,445
有一个在加油站一具尸体！

790
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,766
什么他妈的！

791
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,488
我们在哪？哪里是万宝路？

792
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,807
你没听见我刚才说的？

793
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,206
有一个他妈的尸体在那里，男人！

794
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,811
是的，我听说你。

795
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,411
好吧，我们在一个战区，兄弟。

796
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,244
有尸体，放松。

797
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,444
好吧，我要撒尿。

798
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,041
什么？

799
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,441
小心。

800
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,120
我很好，兄弟。我知道如何采取小便，好吗？

801
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,401
拉屎。

802
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
他妈的。

803
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,048
- 你好？ - 嘿。

804
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,444
嘿，宝贝，一切都好吗？

805
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,641
是啊。

806
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,445
那里现在是几点呢？

807
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,001
这是，嗯，在早晨7:30。

808
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,684
妈的，我把你吵醒？

809
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,003
不，我只是在酒店。我们要吃点早餐。

810
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,567
听着，我不是说我喜欢它，

811
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,485
但我得到你为什么这样做。

812
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,207
你做？

813
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,325
这整个过程中我从来没有想过你必须经历的。

814
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,369
所有你下的压力。

815
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,444
它只是杀死我的大话。

816
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,443
这让我觉得我在这孤独。

817
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,566
不，你不是仅此。

818
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,684
我要你知道，你能告诉我什么，大卫。

819
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,723
我们的合作伙伴，还记得吗？

820
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,721
大卫？

821
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,525
是啊，我得叫你马上回来。

822
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,250
- 一切都好吗？ - 是啊，一切都很好。

823
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,441
我正要给你打电话回来，好吗？

824
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,681
我爱你。再见。

825
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,843
埃夫拉伊姆！

826
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,481
埃夫拉伊姆！

827
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,410
- 什么？ - 看！

828
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,888
万宝路！

829
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,251
他妈的！什么他妈的，兄弟。

830
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,726
神圣的狗屎，他们有枪，男人！

831
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,160
我知道！

832
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,486
走吧，走吧！来吧。

833
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,648
什么他妈的！这将无法启动！

834
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,171
凡他妈的是万宝路？

835
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,442
- 我知道了！ - 走！走！

836
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,241
不不不！

837
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,770
等待，等待，等待！

838
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,883
等待！没有！

839
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,610
跑，狗娘养的！跳！

840
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,245
天啊！他们越来越近。来吧，伙计。走！

841
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,885
走吧，走吧！

842
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,127
来吧！

843
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,367
你在跟我开玩笑吗？

844
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,608
我们在费卢杰停气？

845
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,041
你他妈的便宜！

846
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,926
走！

847
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,610
去你妈的，万宝路！

848
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,481
他妈的。

849
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,525
他妈的。他妈的。

850
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,370
我们是怎么死的！

851
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,728
你想开车到巴格达，你这个混蛋！

852
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,847
他们停止。

853
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,247
什么他妈的？看。

854
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,050
圣他妈的，兄弟。

855
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,650
哦，他妈的！好吧！

856
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,611
上帝保佑切尼的美国！

857
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,326
看看这他妈的地方。哦，我的上帝。

858
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,726
对不起，先生？

859
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,921
什么？

860
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,645
这里有一些人要见你。

861
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,046
一些球员？

862
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,805
什么样的人呢？

863
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,365
嘿，万宝路！

864
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,603
给我们一个微笑，华丽。

865
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,840
让我看那些珍珠黄色。

866
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,766
你就像一个伊拉克汤姆・谢立克，兄弟。

867
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,370
你们是AEY？

868
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,684
是的先生。大卫Packouz。

869
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,008
这是我的同事，埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli。

870
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,131
我们采访的电话。

871
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,766
我记得。

872
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,171
你开这些？

873
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,962
过死三角？

874
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,569
他妈的一个正确的我们做到了。

875
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,969
基普，带这些孩子到笼子里，让他们支付。

876
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,161
向右走，先生。

877
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,084
我错了你们两个。

878
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,163
大他妈的工作，男孩。

879
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,371
大他妈的工作。

880
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,804
神圣的狗屎，死亡三角，兄弟？

881
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,082
那就对了。这就是AEY保证，婊子。

882
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,602
我们通过所有三角形驱动，包括你妈妈的。

883
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,728
嘿，硖，我们捕捉的照片，伙计。

884
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,921
好吧。

885
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,721
准备？

886
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,081
- 如何是我的头发？ - 这是很好的，穿好了。

887
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,770
谢谢。

888
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,121
- 得了你。 - 让我看看。

889
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,161
赫尔穆特・牛顿他妈的在这里。

890
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,481
好吧，伙计。

891
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,770
- 完美。 - 好吧，好吧。

892
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,525
让我们去得到他妈的支付。

893
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,806
神圣的狗屎。

894
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,362
疯了吧？ $ 12.2十亿。

895
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,524
这一切都从自己的教父查获。

896
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,041
你们叫萨达姆的教父？

897
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,120
看看所有这些现金，兄弟。你会打电话给他？

898
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,845
$ 280万美元。

899
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,887
- 这里签字。 - 你说对了。

900
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,288
我们得到了一个军队护送到机场

901
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,046
并得到了他妈的巴格达。

902
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,326
有现金近$ 3万

903
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,761
塞进我军颁发的行李袋。

904
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,448
你可能会认为后挣扎在生死线伊拉克

905
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,846
那我们就来完成。

906
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,841
但是你错了。

907
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,042
你看，贝雷塔交易把我们在地图上。

908
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,289
在那之后，我们就开始杀死它。

909
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,290
我们买保时捷匹配。

910
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,041
我们在同一栋大楼买了两套公寓。

911
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,891
哦，我的上帝。

912
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,051
神圣的狗屎，兄弟。

913
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,246
哦!

914
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,121
喔！

915
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,804
拉尔夫很高兴与他的回报

916
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,929
他增加了他的原始投资

917
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,043
在AEY 1000万$。

918
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,091
这给了我们足够的资本去追求更多的交易

919
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,645
扩大公司。

920
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,088
这正是我们所做的。

921
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,286
我不能强调这一点。

922
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,804
你必须要精练这个网站。

923
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,286
日夜。

924
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,491
它是由分钟更新。

925
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,482
有募捐数万本网站上。

926
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,043
每个人是40至50页。

927
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,921
如果你看到一些有趣的事情，

928
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,130
你把它给我。

929
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,808
如果你把它给我，

930
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,090
我会让你发财。

931
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,851
事实上，18个月前，

932
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,963
大卫在这里是抽风了钱的家伙。

933
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,521
实际上，这不是事实。

934
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,205
这绝对是一个事实。

935
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,524
现在，他驾驶一辆保时捷。

936
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,084
那是因为AEY所有。

937
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,401
你有什么问题吗？

938
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,203
嗯，我有一个问题。

939
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,248
什么是AEY立场？

940
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,131
你什么意思？像道德？

941
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,244
不，我的意思是什么字母是什么意思？

942
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,324
这是他妈的...

943
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,568
什么是IBM代表什么？没有。

944
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,808
它只是...只是听起来专业。

945
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,686
呃，其实，IBM代表了国际商业机器公司。

946
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,086
你说什么？

947
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,648
IBM代表国际商业机器。

948
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,611
获得他妈的离开这里。

949
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,683
我是认真的。你不会在这里工作。

950
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,411
获得他妈的我的办公室，你他妈的书呆子！

951
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,001
走！

952
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,610
并记录在案，AEY并不代表什么。

953
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,448
他妈的！什么家伙。

954
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,606
有没有人有任何问题吗？

955
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,529
睡觉。我得到了她。

956
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,166
好吧。好吧。

957
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,521
你好。

958
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,404
我知道。

959
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,561
我知道。没关系。

960
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,201
好的。

961
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,366
什么？

962
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,605
360000 SVD狙击步枪。

963
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,287
1,084,000 GP-30榴弹。

964
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,002
45000 SKO航空火箭弹。

965
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,726
五角大楼的武装阿富汗人在未来30年。

966
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,843
他们正在建造一个全军。

967
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,289
等一下，这一定是一个错字。

968
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,806
不是。

969
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,284
亿发AK-47弹药？

970
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,642
兄弟，这些都不是面包屑。

971
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,127
这是整个他妈的馅饼。

972
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,210
在国防承包商，

973
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,051
这将来到被称为阿富汗的交易。

974
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,083
这将是最大的机会

975
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,044
AEY将永远看到的。

976
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,249
我们不得不去了。

977
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,090
所以，你在哪里去武装整个国家？

978
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,891
拉斯维加斯X是在那里的军事和制造商

979
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,124
一起来揭开战争中的最新产品。

980
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,842
这就像动漫展手榴弹。

981
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,640
当然，大多数人并不知道谁是AEY。

982
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,801
但是，我们看到，作为一个优势。

983
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,690
- 你有你的名单？ - 得到它了。

984
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,842
- 你感觉良好？ - 是啊，我感觉还不错。

985
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,162
要知道，这是不是在手机上开展业务的不同。

986
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,044
当他们看到我们，他们会看到两个孩子。

987
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,366
因此，我们必须向他们展示我们的球。

988
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,521
得到它了。

989
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,489
我们需要他妈的打手，你明白吗？

990
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,721
了解。

991
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,962
好吧，好了。让我们杀了这个狗屎。

992
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,328
但它是一个完整的灾难。

993
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,006
我们很快了解到，

994
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,043
即使我们可以降落阿富汗交易，

995
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,567
这将是一个后勤恶梦。

996
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,240
杰里，很高兴见到你。

997
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,364
到源这种规模的交易

998
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,846
将意味着拼凑

999
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,884
来自世界各地的多个供应商。

1000
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,445
哇，哇。

1001
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,721
离开这里。

1002
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,684
这将需要几十航运的服装

1003
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,245
和数以百计的许可证。

1004
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,930
我们需要亿发子弹。

1005
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,727
所有这一切可能是没关系的主要国防承包商。

1006
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,251
但不适合我们。

1007
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,967
说实话，我们是我们的联赛。

1008
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,642
更改$ 10,000。

1009
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,605
今天运气好的话？

1010
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,766
埃夫拉伊姆！

1011
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,801
这是怎么回事，兄弟？

1012
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,325
你去了哪里啊？你为什么不回答你的电话吗？

1013
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,766
我与一个妓女。这是怎么回事？

1014
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,122
好吧，你要穿好衣服，现在跟我来。

1015
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,283
好吧，嗯，给我

1016
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,607
38分钟。

1017
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,122
埃夫拉伊姆，亨利・吉拉德下来吧，等待着我们。

1018
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,841
获得他妈的离开这里。

1019
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,361
我死了认真的。

1020
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,807
拉屎。

1021
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,201
好的。

1022
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,010
亨利・吉拉德是军火商之间的传奇。

1023
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,683
当他们挂萨达姆反人类罪

1024
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,366
有人说，亨利卖给他们的绳子。

1025
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,641
嗨，亨利，对不起，我来晚了。

1026
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,171
这是我的搭档，我告诉你有关。

1027
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,328
- 埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli。 - 很高兴见到你。

1028
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,164
这是一个绝对的快乐。

1029
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,686
亨利在10分钟吃饭，

1030
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,365
但我想你第一手听到这个。

1031
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,968
我给他看了名单，他可以提供帮助。

1032
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,409
大。随着哪一部分？

1033
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,681
所有的。

1034
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,571
他可以填补整个订单。

1035
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,004
- 整个订单？ - 嗯，嗯。

1036
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,645
即使是AK弹药？

1037
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,530
不是一个问题。

1038
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,566
你知道它的100万发，对不对？

1039
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,689
亨利在阿尔巴尼亚的接触。

1040
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,367
阿尔巴尼亚？

1041
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,360
他们花了几十年对于没有来西方的入侵做准备。

1042
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,369
那国家是一个巨大的军火库。

1043
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,528
这一切都只是坐在那里。

1044
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,001
告诉他最好的部分。

1045
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,202
他们在加入北约的过程中，

1046
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,609
所以他们必须处理他们所有的苏联时代的武器。

1047
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,049
他们是从字面上拆解它，并把它变成废品。

1048
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,568
我可以得到最狗屎的对美元的便士。

1049
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,570
现在，告诉他其他的最好的部分。

1050
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,043
您现在看到的整个他妈的事情的独家代理。

1051
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,130
这是灵丹妙药。

1052
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,247
一个供应商谁能够填满整个阿富汗的交易。

1053
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,727
这不仅让我们在争。

1054
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,087
我们可能真正赢得这个事情。

1055
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,041
对不起，我有一个问题。

1056
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,401
当然。

1057
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,204
有了这样转播

1058
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,289
你为什么不只是竞标合同上自己？

1059
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,921
全面披露？

1060
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,762
我是从做任何生意与美国政府禁止。

1061
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,086
我是一个观察名单。

1062
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,486
像恐怖分子观察名单？

1063
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,807
嗯，嗯。

1064
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,402
- 得到它了。 - 等等，什么？

1065
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,090
好吧，多少的AK弹药？

1066
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,482
-  10仙圆。 - 这是他妈的惊人。

1067
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,721
而关于航运什么？

1068
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,450
您可以通过俄罗斯飞行员得到伊留申76。

1069
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,681
每次飞行80K。

1070
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,769
对不起，你是一个恐怖分子监视名单上吗？

1071
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,081
什么他妈的！

1072
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,282
你的国土安全工作？放松，兄弟。

1073
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,404
你们两个也许应该讨论这个问题。

1074
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,126
我们将会。但是我们非常有兴趣。

1075
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,601
好。我的航班明天早上10点离开。

1076
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,802
我不能在这个破花费超过48小时。

1077
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,920
这就是我经常说。拉斯维加斯是一个为期两天的小镇。

1078
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,290
我说的是美国。

1079
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,963
我们谈论到储备独占访问

1080
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,527
的苏联集团的非制式武器和弹药。

1081
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,364
这就是要赢得这场交易对我们来说。

1082
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,965
他是一个恐怖分子观察名单上！

1083
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,448
随你。人最终名单上的剪刀把上飞机！

1084
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,206
这不是为什么他就行了。

1085
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,523
你看，五角大楼希望亿发AK-47弹药

1086
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,161
在全球范围内不足的中间。

1087
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,527
在哪里你觉得他们认为这将从何而来？

1088
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,885
一堆黑幕怎么就那样的家伙。

1089
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,488
这是作业。

1090
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,489
要与地方的人做生意

1091
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,690
美国政府不能直接做生意。

1092
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,010
就这么简单。

1093
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,646
他妈的！

1094
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,321
嘿，小伙子们。

1095
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,171
所以我们讨论它，我们想继续前进。

1096
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,404
太棒了。恭喜。

1097
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,722
- 但我们必须要看到的商品。 - 哦，当然。

1098
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,530
在现场，在人。

1099
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,164
你们去过阿尔巴尼亚？

1100
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,891
老实说，直到昨晚

1101
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,764
我甚至不知道这是一个真正他妈的国家。

1102
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,570
哦，这是一个美丽的地方。

1103
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,724
来吧，我会打电话给我的人，我们将对其进行设置。

1104
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,608
阿尔巴尼亚是很多东西。

1105
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,002
但是，一个美丽的地方是不是其中之一。

1106
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,565
我们花了三个独立的航班

1107
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,081
和22小时才能到达那里。

1108
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,571
亨利的人发来驱动

1109
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,250
来接我们到机场

1110
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,091
的家伙不会停止说话。

1111
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,044
我摔倒了，她恢复了我。

1112
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,530
但这些都不是减少埃夫拉伊姆的热情。

1113
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,922
他真的相信这可能是答案。

1114
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,605
欢迎您，AEY。

1115
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,441
我是伊利Pinari，

1116
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,961
阿尔巴尼亚最大的军事出口公司的负责人。

1117
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,447
埃夫拉伊姆Diveroli。很高兴见到你。

1118
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,131
这是我的同事，大卫Packouz。

1119
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,964
- 很高兴见到你。 - 你好吗？

1120
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,647
呃...

1121
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,286
谢谢你的迹象。

1122
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,284
哦。这是给你的。

1123
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,330
是的我知道。我说谢谢你的迹象。

1124
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,771
那么，告诉我们你得到了什么。

1125
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,485
这是什么地方？

1126
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,642
存储阿尔巴尼亚军队。

1127
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,129
我们有700多个像它遍布全国各地。

1128
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,322
你有700仓库这样吗？

1129
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,885
不只是仓库。

1130
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,010
我们使用的教堂，医院，学校。

1131
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,322
阿尔巴尼亚是多数武装的国家在世界上。

1132
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,284
嘿，这很酷。恭喜，兄弟。

1133
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,369
这就像在一个有他妈的博物馆。

1134
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,165
大多数这种狗屎没见过日光

1135
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,964
自冷战。

1136
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,810
但是，这并没有关系给我们。

1137
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,207
我们所关心的是AK弹药。

1138
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,405
没关系。我们有很多的你来干什么。

1139
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,526
所有这些容器都充满了你的子弹。

1140
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,009
你是什??么意思，所有的子弹就在这里？

1141
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,491
1.26亿发子弹。

1142
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,647
他妈的我。

1143
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,526
是啊。他妈的我们所有人。

1144
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,401
这些几岁了？

1145
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,724
30，也许40年。 AK-47的子弹

1146
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,042
可以永远持续下去，如果妥善保存。

1147
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,050
对。那么，如何进行这些存储？

1148
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,611
呃，谁给一个他妈的如何将这些被储存？

1149
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,080
所有重要的是，他们的工作他妈的。

1150
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,566
他们工作吗？

1151
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,206
你试试。

1152
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,603
他们他妈的奏效。

1153
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,363
整个国防工业争先恐后了这笔交易。

1154
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,604
而钥匙就坐在23海运集装箱

1155
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,124
在生锈了仓库在世界的另一边的后面。

1156
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,770
我们回来只用足够的时间

1157
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,606
提交政府的最后期限之前我们的申办。

1158
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,400
然后我们等待着。

1159
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,442
我们等了五个月。

1160
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,166
霸。

1161
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,131
大卫！

1162
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,287
- 那是埃夫拉伊姆？ - 什么？

1163
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,487
- 是吗？ - 大卫！

1164
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,080
他妈的，我们赢了！

1165
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,766
神圣的狗屎。我们赢得了阿富汗的交易。

1166
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,485
- 什么？ - 我们赢得了阿富汗交易！

1167
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,926
- 我们赢了？ - 我们他妈的赢了！

1168
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,764
兄弟！你他妈的在开玩笑吗？

1169
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,962
- 我们他妈的赢了！ - 是啊，混蛋！

1170
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,281
是啊！是啊，混蛋！

1171
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,486
在我们可以开始，

1172
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,883
AEY仍然需要由政府来审核。

1173
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,485
这是一个痛苦在屁股过程

1174
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,165
涉及到三个独立的审计

1175
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,971
和一个人的采访。

1176
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,687
审计工作是最大的障碍。

1177
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,531
我的意思是，我们甚至没有一个真正的簿记员。

1178
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,722
我们没有真正的书籍。

1179
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,368
我们不得不编造AEY会计

1180
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,409
回去三年。

1181
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,565
总帐，银行对账单，假采购订单，

1182
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,643
我们结下了一切。

1183
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,084
两个星期后，我们在岩石岛，

1184
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,651
伊利诺斯州为我们的大型会议

1185
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,730
从美国军方采购人员。

1186
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,244
我们是相当他妈的紧张。

1187
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,087
所以埃夫拉伊姆认为这会是一个好主意，让在停车场高。

1188
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,891
耽误。

1189
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,771
这听上去像我们两个以上的人的权利吗？

1190
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,401
是啊。

1191
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,246
这是真正的强者狗屎。

1192
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,526
好的。

1193
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,245
这是非常令人印象深刻。

1194
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,922
非常令人印象深刻。

1195
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,881
坦率地说，我们担心你的表现的历史一点点

1196
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,809
针对这种规模的交易。

1197
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,769
但应符合你们两个照面后，

1198
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,930
我们觉得我们在这一个良好的手中。

1199
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,487
好了，我们不会让你失望，

1200
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,441
先生们。

1201
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,761
更何况，

1202
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,810
您的出价是太有吸引力让我们欲罢不能。

1203
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,440
谢谢。我的意思是，这是伟大的，听到的，因为我们真的很努力这一点。

1204
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,449
抱歉。对不起。

1205
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,168
一个你刚才说的

1206
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,728
我们的报价是太有吸引力错过。

1207
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,769
那你的意思，是什么呢？

1208
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,964
他对你的男孩lowballed的狗屎了你的竞争对手。

1209
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,610
是啊。呃...

1210
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,441
多少？

1211
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,961
百万。

1212
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,245
好的。

1213
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,285
只是我。一世...

1214
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,170
我很好奇，有多少百万？

1215
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,967
那么，在技术上，我们不应该讨论与您，

1216
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,844
但什么是地狱。

1217
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,130
你们来到比最接近的竞争对手低53个$万元。

1218
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,760
他妈的！他妈的！

1219
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,841
混蛋！

1220
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,884
$ 53个亿美元。

1221
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,850
我们准备好了。

1222
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,040
看看好的一面。

1223
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,850
这一次，美国纳税人

1224
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,162
越来越国防合同一个很好的协议。

1225
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,966
男人，他妈的美国纳税人。

1226
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,566
你好？

1227
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,201
IZ？

1228
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,689
嘿，艾拉。你好。

1229
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,011
亲爱的，你怎么样？

1230
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,564
嘿。你知道她的蓝色凉鞋？

1231
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,366
哦，嘿嘿。

1232
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,529
嗯，我不知道。

1233
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,210
但听着，我们可以谈一秒钟？

1234
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,851
嗯，嗯。

1235
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,727
我需要回去阿尔巴尼亚几个星期。

1236
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,685
一个月，上衣。

1237
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,400
当然。没问题。

1238
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,442
嘿，怎么了？

1239
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,090
艾拉和我打算留下来跟我妈一会。

1240
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,765
什么？你在说什么？

1241
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,801
IZ，发生了什么？

1242
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,122
你怎么没告诉我你去伊拉克？

1243
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,771
我一直在寻找的水管工的数量

1244
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,247
您的计算机上，我看到的照片。

1245
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,807
我可以解释。

1246
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,929
你说你从来没有离开约旦的酒店房间。

1247
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,766
我知道。因为我不想吓坏你。

1248
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,168
为什么每次都是它，我抓住你的谎言

1249
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,768
你试图说服我，你骗我的好处？

1250
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,325
在什么时候，你只是承认你是个骗子？

1251
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,603
IZ，你会停下来，好吗？

1252
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,565
我们说我们会告诉对方一切。

1253
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,324
- 你保证过！ - 我知道！好吧，我搞砸了。

1254
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,483
还有什么你不告诉我？

1255
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,761
- 没有。 - 号

1256
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,291
认真。

1257
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,241
你现在知道的一切。

1258
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,684
好的。你不是要问我为什么叫水管工？

1259
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,122
好，当然。发生了什么？

1260
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,764
管道漏水的客用浴室。

1261
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,005
我找到了这个。

1262
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,041
让我猜猜。你不想吓坏我吗？

1263
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,327
好吧，坚持住。

1264
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,170
所以，我躲在水池下面一些钱。

1265
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,441
有什么大不了的？

1266
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,642
大不了就是你从我这里把它藏！

1267
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,881
不，我没有！

1268
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,650
那么谁是你的躲呢？

1269
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,528
我不知道。这是愚蠢的。你是对的。

1270
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,004
我们要离开你想别的话要说了。

1271
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,884
IZ，我很抱歉。

1272
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,851
IZ！

1273
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,480
哦，他妈的。

1274
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,005
嘿，这是怎么回事，人呢？

1275
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,281
这是怎么回事？

1276
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,527
刚准备离开。

1277
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,041
那是什么？

1278
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,730
我只是想感谢您同意去这一趟。

1279
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,400
它不输于我，

1280
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,887
牺牲你让这家公司。

1281
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,525
我真的很感激。

1282
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,404
“为了我的合作伙伴，大卫。世界是你们的。”

1283
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,685
- 这是一个从疤面煞星。 - 当然，男人。我记得。

1284
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,686
谢谢。

1285
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,361
是啊。

1286
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,760
呃，嘿嘿，在我走之前，

1287
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,605
我只是想...

1288
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,321
这是什么？

1289
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,928
这是我们的合作伙伴协议。 70-30。

1290
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,327
我只是想使它官员。

1291
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,280
嗯，当然咯。

1292
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,286
- 是个好主意。 - 酷。

1293
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,207
男子八周他妈的在阿尔巴尼亚。

1294
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,841
IZ是要恨我一辈子。

1295
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,961
不，她是怎么回事，每天吸你的公鸡一年。

1296
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,126
因为我们是做上的3000万$的边缘。

1297
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,406
是啊，男人。

1298
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,243
去粉碎它。

1299
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,126
多谢兄弟。

1300
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,286
尼斯。

1301
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,080
嘿，你已经达到了IZ。你知道该怎么做。

1302
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,921
来吧，IZ。不要打断我这个样子。

1303
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,367
我在阿尔巴尼亚，在酒店。

1304
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,609
左侧的数字和你妈妈。

1305
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,531
如果你能请你只给我回电话

1306
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,927
因为我真的很想念你。好的？

1307
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,487
我爱你。

1308
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,921
再见。

1309
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,131
早上好，伙计。

1310
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,845
嘿，巴什基姆。

1311
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,684
哦，我给你Kolonat。这是我们的麦当劳。

1312
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,402
是啊，我很好。但是感谢。

1313
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,290
我们现在去上班？

1314
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,082
嗯。不不不。我说我需要两辆卡车。

1315
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,487
是啊，你刚刚得到了一个在这里现在。

1316
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,883
是啊。你看，我有一架货机坐在机场。

1317
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,929
对，我知道。我知道。

1318
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,801
嘿，让我叫你马上回来。

1319
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,331
嘿，别！停，停！

1320
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,289
抱起来，抱起来，抱起来！嘿，把它们关掉！

1321
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,760
什么他妈的是什么？

1322
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,288
你从哪里得到的？

1323
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,921
哟！这是怎么回事？

1324
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,730
嘿，伙计，我们得到了一个问题。

1325
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,561
- 你在哪？ - 我在丽芙，兄弟。

1326
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,366
试图一鼓作气谁是我的桌边等着我一些古巴小鸡。

1327
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,561
为什么，我们怎么得了？

1328
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,481
让我说清楚。我在阿尔巴尼亚，现在冻结我的屁股。

1329
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,966
你在丽芙，试图得到下岗？

1330
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,611
大卫，这是凌晨1:00在这里。

1331
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,285
我吹了一些蒸气。

1332
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,244
是啊，凌晨1:00时你应该在办公室

1333
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,131
因为这是他妈的一天中在每一个国家，我们做的生意。

1334
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,561
你看，我们得到的AK弹药问题。

1335
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,481
- 什么样的问题？ - 这是中国人。

1336
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,445
中国，兄弟？这是什么意思，甚至，中国人吗？

1337
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,165
这意味着它从中国的。

1338
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,722
你在说什么？我在那里，我看到了弹药。

1339
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,921
我们都做到了。

1340
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,281
是啊，你看，我不知道该怎么告诉你。

1341
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,680
他们在性交我们。好的？我们被耍了。

1342
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,611
坚持，稍等。你怎么知道它是中国人吗？

1343
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,610
有每个箱子他妈的中国文字。

1344
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,609
相信我，这是中国人。

1345
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,881
是啊。

1346
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,121
亨利，什么他妈的！

1347
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,930
我们一直在找你两天！

1348
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,201
这是埃夫拉伊姆和大卫。

1349
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,851
我们有一个严重的问题，他妈的。

1350
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,281
我在听。

1351
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,648
该AK弹药，这是中国人。

1352
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,729
什么，你觉得谁的阿富汗人越来越

1353
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,003
塔利班狂涨给他们的地方弹药来自一个狗屎？

1354
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,645
没有，但五角大楼确实。

1355
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,365
亨利，你知道我们不能用中国人！

1356
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,289
美国有对中国的禁运。

1357
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,246
你有你的男孩向我们展示阿尔巴尼亚的弹药在整个国家一箱。

1358
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,886
对不起，没有任何人阻止你检查其他箱子？

1359
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,488
你甚至懒得问原产国是？

1360
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,011
谁他妈的会问这个？

1361
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,086
亨利，我盯着100万发

1362
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,045
中国非法弹药的你卖给我们。

1363
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,480
那么，我们应该怎么办？

1364
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,484
做你他妈的工作！

1365
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,761
美国政府希望寻找其他方式。

1366
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,007
不要给他们一个理由不这样做。

1367
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,771
虽然你在它，学习之间的差异

1368
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,725
“我们有一个问题”和“你有问题。”

1369
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,881
他妈的！

1370
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,607
我们被性交。弹药是不值钱

1371
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,889
我被困在阿尔巴尼亚试图拼凑新的供应商

1372
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,481
来自全国各地东欧。

1373
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,881
神圣的狗屎。

1374
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,565
什么他妈的你在这里干什么，伙计？

1375
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,841
我有一个大的想法。

1376
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,006
你怎么在我的房间里得到什么？

1377
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,486
他们让我进去。

1378
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,645
我是一个值得信赖的人。

1379
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,531
他们不仅让我，他们给我带来了客房服务。

1380
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,606
无论如何，我有一个大他妈的主意。

1381
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,326
是吗？那是什么？

1382
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,800
如果我们重新包装什么？

1383
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,321
重新包装什么？

1384
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,521
子弹！

1385
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,610
如果我们重新包装他们呢？

1386
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,171
亿发？

1387
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,131
大卫，这是可以做到。

1388
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,881
想想吧。我们也将节省运费的财富。

1389
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,162
我们换了所有的大，重型木箱

1390
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,925
光纸箱。

1391
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,202
是的，但它仍然是中国的弹药。

1392
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,643
看看这条毛巾。好的？

1393
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,767
土耳其。土耳其制造。

1394
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,484
不再。现在是阿尔巴尼亚的毛巾。

1395
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,041
这只是中国如果包装说，这是中国人。

1396
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,927
是啊。但是，我的意思是，这也是非法他妈的，男人。

1397
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,569
我们有两个选择。

1398
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,041
我们要么重新包装这个狗屎，并把它关闭

1399
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,971
或者我们可以从$ 300亿的交易走开。

1400
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,130
您想做什么？

1401
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,169
当你把它像有真的只有一个选项。

1402
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,481
我们的司机巴什基姆把我们介绍给他的朋友

1403
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,047
谁拥有拳击和存储公司出地拉那。

1404
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,046
这是恩维尔。我和他一起长大。

1405
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,281
很高兴见到你，恩维尔。

1406
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,201
你也是。巴什基姆告诉我一些关于你的情况。

1407
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,051
是啊，你看，简单地说，我们有一个体重问题。

1408
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,208
我们运送弹药量大

1409
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,129
从阿尔巴尼亚到阿富汗。

1410
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,765
现在，它的包装重罐

1411
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,166
里面大木箱。

1412
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,566
我们希望做什么

1413
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,564
对那些子弹转移到塑料袋

1414
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,211
然后把那些在双壁，

1415
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,765
瓦楞纸箱。

1416
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,921
你知道那些是什么？

1417
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,527
嗯，当然咯。是什么原因？

1418
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,961
我们只是告诉你。

1419
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,531
什么他妈的这个国家是什么呢？

1420
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,646
原包装，这是太重了。

1421
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,691
太多的板条箱。我们需要简化。

1422
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,249
好的。有多少箱？

1423
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,410
很多。它的100万发子弹。

1424
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,083
了解。但究竟有多少实际的箱子？

1425
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,327
我们有68520箱。

1426
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,286
我已经看到了。

1427
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,164
这他妈的疯了。

1428
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,961
完成。

1429
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,001
因此50名男子，八个星期。

1430
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,445
我能为$ 100,000做到这一点。

1431
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,609
100000美元？

1432
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,961
是啊。

1433
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,324
- 给我们一秒钟。 - 是啊。一秒钟，请。

1434
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,370
好的。我会很认真地谈。

1435
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,046
这是很难不笑。

1436
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,204
我的意思是，不仅是这家伙保存整个交易，

1437
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,925
但重新包装的所有弹药

1438
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,528
我们将由近300万$增加我们的利润空间。

1439
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,251
我们应该从哪里得到共进晚餐吗？

1440
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,722
有这个地方的酒店。这是相当不错的。

1441
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,122
好的。好了，继续前进。

1442
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,601
好吧，成交。

1443
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,123
它甚至比我们想象的要好。

1444
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,688
我们在交易清淡纸箱重木箱。

1445
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,645
8盎司罐装塑料袋。

1446
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,085
通过重新包装的弹药，

1447
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,886
我们会被180吨减轻我们的整体负载。

1448
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,287
180他妈的吨！

1449
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:03,166
这意味着使用更轻的飞机燃烧更少的燃油更少的航班。

1450
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,883
所有加起来更多的钱给我们。

1451
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,927
在2007年12月8日，

1452
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,361
AEY交付了第500万发

1453
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,562
阿富汗军队。

1454
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,409
它进行得非常顺利。

1455
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,362
来吧，只要说一次，亲爱的。来吧。

1456
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,604
说“达达”。说“达达”。

1457
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,880
我们真的得走了，大卫。

1458
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,447
不，嘿嘿，五分钟，好吗？请？

1459
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,002
我们约吃饭。我妈妈的等待。

1460
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,289
云裳，挥手告别爸爸。嗯。

1461
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,766
再见，艾拉。

1462
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,169
圣诞节快乐。我爱你。

1463
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,326
嘿，你可以给她你的妈妈，这样我们可以谈一下吗？

1464
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,601
我很抱歉，大卫。

1465
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,081
我们会打电话给你几天。好的？

1466
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,121
再见。

1467
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,401
嘿，这是大卫。

1468
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,285
兄弟，你想听到的东西完全搞砸了？

1469
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,209
圣诞快乐，埃夫拉伊姆。

1470
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,481
这是圣诞节？

1471
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,727
这就是为什么没有人在这里。

1472
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,241
我正要火了整个办公室。

1473
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,124
不管怎样，当我在那里，

1474
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,322
我是说我们的孩子，巴什基姆。

1475
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,601
你知道他的叔叔

1476
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,127
在阿尔巴尼亚国防部的作品？

1477
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,321
不，我不知道。

1478
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,561
好吧，他的确。

1479
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,531
所以我说，“你知道什么是对我有意思，巴什基姆？

1480
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,084
“我很好奇，想知道亨利付出的AK弹药的阿尔巴尼亚人。”

1481
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,281
埃夫拉伊姆？

1482
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,045
你知道他发现了？

1483
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,722
那个混蛋是付出两年半仙圆。

1484
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,002
他向我们收费400％的加价！

1485
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,009
是啊。所以呢？我们做同样的事情。

1486
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,526
是啊，但是这是我们的合同。

1487
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,371
我们几乎失去了它，因为他和他的中国他妈的子弹。

1488
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,561
但我们并没有失去它。

1489
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,841
这不是问题的关键！

1490
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,447
我想弄清楚的方式来削减该口交退出交易。

1491
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,880
埃夫拉伊姆，停止。

1492
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,167
不，听我说。

1493
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,044
我是认真的，伙计。

1494
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,480
我们赚钱的，行吗？

1495
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,524
他赚钱的，整个事情是他妈的工作。

1496
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,085
不要惹它。

1497
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,726
我不给他妈的。他抓取我们送行！

1498
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,921
你看，我是认真的，好吗？

1499
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,805
我要上下一班机离开这里，如果你拉的狗屎。

1500
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,807
哇。兄弟，你不用威胁我。

1501
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,445
好吧？我是你的合作伙伴。

1502
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,563
是的，它并不总是这样的。

1503
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,403
我发现这个交易。而我在这里

1504
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,171
做所有的工作，你是在迈阿密试图破坏它。

1505
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,289
我怎么破坏呢？

1506
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,723
通过尝试过他妈的亨利，你他妈的在其他人的方式。

1507
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,647
你是对的。亨利的合作伙伴。

1508
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,603
他是我们得到了这笔交易的原因。

1509
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,847
我只是寻找出我们，我把它太远。

1510
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,562
不出汗，兄弟。我将离开单干。

1511
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,926
谢谢。

1512
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,881
我们不能把我们的运气这个狗屎，伙计。

1513
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,805
好吧，我会尽快和你谈谈。再见。

1514
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,241
哇。什么他妈的？嘿。

1515
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,561
他妈的！停止。

1516
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,204
停止！我不明白！

1517
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,962
你现在明白了么？

1518
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,001
是啊。是。

1519
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,763
难道你真的认为你可以把我从我自己的交易？

1520
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,681
请。

1521
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,881
他妈的。

1522
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,521
他妈的。

1523
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,281
大卫，我们需要谈谈。

1524
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,806
现在是不是一个好时机。

1525
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,283
我尚未支付。

1526
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,010
你什么意思？像月？

1527
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,406
永远。

1528
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,489
您尚未支付什么？

1529
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,081
你的伴侣不回电话。

1530
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,163
我的球员需要支付。

1531
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,601
他们将停止工作。

1532
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,564
大卫，我知道真正的原因

1533
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,444
要重新包装的弹药。

1534
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,565
好吧，你看，恩维尔。听我说。

1535
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,047
我得马上飞到迈阿密。我马上就回来一个星期。

1536
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,361
但是，我答应你，我要去的第一件事情做的时候我的土地

1537
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,728
为确保你得到你的钱有线，好吗？

1538
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,441
好的。

1539
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,641
大卫。

1540
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,201
机场，我们走吧。

1541
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,961
大卫。

1542
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,727
你看，我的飞行晚了。下周我会回来的。

1543
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,968
她说，她的丈夫没有回家，昨晚。

1544
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,769
好吧，你要我做什么？

1545
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,008
她很担心。它不喜欢他。

1546
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,370
告诉她，我不知道她的丈夫。

1547
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,561
谁是你的丈夫吗？

1548
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,683
巴什基姆。

1549
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,041
没有人能从巴什基姆再次听到。

1550
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,642
他们从来没有发现一张纸条，他们从来没有发现一具尸体。

1551
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,364
他刚掉下来的星球。

1552
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,884
我当时阿尔巴尼亚完成。

1553
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,123
我从来没有回去。

1554
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,361
你好。

1555
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,841
嘿。

1556
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,207
我去了阿尔巴尼亚的原因是分装弹药中国

1557
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,210
所以我们可以掩饰它，并把它卖给了美国政府。

1558
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,168
这听起来是非法的。

1559
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,928
它是。但是我完了。

1560
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,491
我发誓，无论我的余生会发生什么

1561
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,409
我永远不会再骗你。

1562
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,686
嗯，嗯。

1563
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,564
我爱你那么多，IZ。

1564
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,840
发生了什么事你的鼻子？

1565
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,048
我当时阿尔巴尼亚歹徒绑架。

1566
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,571
- 我认为这是坏了。 - 哦，我的上帝。

1567
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,440
我想我会回去做按摩师。

1568
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,040
可以吗？

1569
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,605
是。

1570
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,844
它总是好的。

1571
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,370
嘿，你回来了。

1572
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,961
哇！

1573
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,401
兄弟，你在做什么了？发生了什么事，你的脸？

1574
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,568
这是一个已经在阿富汗的交易提供的一切。

1575
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,881
我希望我的削减。我出去了。

1576
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,766
你在说什么？

1577
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,362
他把枪他妈的我的头，伙计。

1578
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,881
谁，亨利？

1579
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,690
你说，你要不要管它。

1580
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,250
哦，他妈的。

1581
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,688
我搞砸了。

1582
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,087
我完了，埃夫拉伊姆。

1583
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,282
你看，你不用回去。

1584
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,885
我聘请了这个新家伙，伊万。

1585
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,929
- 他会讲阿尔巴尼亚人。 - 我受够了。

1586
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,481
什么，你以为我只是GOT 4百万美元奠定左右？

1587
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,040
我已经想通了。

1588
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,208
我要对美元40美分。

1589
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,243
是的，我认为它经历了太多。

1590
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,761
这个怎么样？

1591
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,889
如何对美元零美分？

1592
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,165
让我提醒你，我们有合同。

1593
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,686
他妈的你的合同！

1594
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,445
如果我问你我造的房子，

1595
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,640
你不干构建我一半的房子后，你觉得我欠你一半的钱？

1596
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,922
这是一个笑话他妈的，大卫？

1597
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,600
你有两个星期。否则，你会从我的律师听到。

1598
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,850
谁，沃伦？

1599
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,442
你说的是沃伦？他是我的律师了。

1600
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,841
我介绍给他。

1601
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,925
他妈的沃伦。

1602
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,601
他妈的！

1603
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,124
AEY。我怎么可能会引导你的电话？

1604
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,730
我们吵架。

1605
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,845
与家人扑灭，

1606
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,809
与我们的商业伙伴争取。

1607
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,128
有时候，我们与我们的朋友而战。

1608
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,401
如果上帝在这里，

1609
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,965
我们很可能与他拼了。

1610
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,288
埃夫拉伊姆有一个沉重的心脏上发生了什么。

1611
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,447
没有进攻，拉尔夫，但我不知道你见过真正的埃夫拉伊姆。

1612
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,801
他是一个复杂的年轻人。

1613
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,763
但他只是想坐下来谈谈。

1614
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,805
找到一个公平的解决方案。

1615
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,249
他问我来调解。

1616
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,164
让我来帮你，大卫。

1617
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,401
我只是不知道如果我准备好了。

1618
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,647
好吧，他在这里。

1619
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,006
嗨！哥们儿。

1620
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,922
很高兴见到你。

1621
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,528
对不起，事情变得如此疯狂。

1622
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,730
是啊。我也是。

1623
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,570
你有什么，亲爱的？

1624
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,808
我就喝杯咖啡。谢谢。

1625
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,964
我想过了很多。

1626
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,600
而且我不希望你从这个空手走开。

1627
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,801
凉。

1628
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,611
因此，我不得不沃伦起草了遣散协议。

1629
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,285
我认为这是很公平的。

1630
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,411
我准备给你钱了50K，每年在接下来的四年。

1631
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,046
200盛大？

1632
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,524
这是一个他妈的笑话，男人呢？

1633
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,084
这就是你调解的意思？

1634
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,560
平心而论，从没有

1635
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,728
合伙协议，事先没有合同。

1636
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,971
是啊。我有东西比一个合作协议更好。

1637
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,964
我有证据。

1638
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,680
我离开阿尔巴尼亚前，我把一切。

1639
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,881
什么他妈的。

1640
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,811
我们所伪造的文件，重新包装的照片。

1641
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,081
- 大卫！ - 重新包装？

1642
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,520
- 他没告诉你吗？ - 大卫！

1643
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,131
哦，是的，我们采取了钱，你给了我们，

1644
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,164
我们买了100万发中国非法弹药，

1645
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,211
那么，我们重新包装，并将其出售给美国军方。

1646
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,085
是啊，我们做了$ 8个万做，混蛋。

1647
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,281
小心，埃夫拉伊姆。

1648
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,930
我们告诉拉尔夫我们只对一个做$ 3百万。

1649
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,121
等等，现在怎么办？

1650
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,964
他每月向您发送虚假会计报告。

1651
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,844
- 噢，滚开。 - 我让他们在我的笔记本电脑。

1652
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,326
现在你要做的仅仅是狗屎。

1653
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,722
真？因为我一直的一切，你他妈的哑巴！

1654
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,571
我甚至有我们Photoshop处理的银行对账单复印件

1655
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,807
并送到政府。

1656
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,082
获得他妈的离开这里。

1657
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,124
我可以埋葬你。

1658
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,046
我们。

1659
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,364
我觉得你的意思是说，

1660
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,882
你可以把我们埋葬。

1661
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,202
因为任何暗示我，

1662
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,881
暗示你。

1663
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,206
- 埃夫拉伊姆，等待。 - 不不不。

1664
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,961
我来到这里，准备今天向您支付$ 200000。

1665
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,525
现在，我还没有去支付早餐。

1666
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,844
哦。发生了什么事在这里？咦？

1667
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,081
你好？

1668
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,123
我愿与大卫Packouz说话？

1669
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,322
- 是啊，这是谁？ - 嗨，大卫。

1670
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,603
这是CJ Chivers与纽约时报。

1671
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,451
我想知道，如果你有一分钟??的时间谈AEY，

1672
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,962
和所谓中国弹药分装。

1673
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,085
我不知道你在说什么。

1674
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,408
那么，根据我的消息来源，有一个正在进行的调查

1675
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,601
在国务院。

1676
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,444
我希望得到一些澄清...

1677
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,888
大卫，这听起来相当严重。

1678
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,411
对，我知道。

1679
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,124
也许你应该叫我叔叔。

1680
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,086
律师。

1681
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,651
哦，我的上帝。好的。

1682
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,444
这是一个好主意。

1683
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,246
嘿，给我一分钟。我会满足你在大堂的家伙。

1684
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,721
你只是获得纽约时报通话？

1685
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,041
是啊。

1686
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,881
我也是。

1687
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,881
要知道，疤面煞星昨晚在电视上，

1688
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,330
我看着它，想着我们小时候

1689
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,851
我们用来做电影中的线路。

1690
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,362
你是我最好的朋友，大卫。

1691
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,000
天啊，我真的搞砸这件事，不是吗？

1692
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,924
对不起，兄弟。

1693
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,481
哇。

1694
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,048
你永远不采取行动，伙计？

1695
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,727
这意味着什么？

1696
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,287
你只要告诉我你以为我想听，

1697
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,481
因为纽约时报叫，

1698
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,682
而你吓坏了，我可能会说些什么。

1699
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,486
承认吧。

1700
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,208
我们从来没有最好的朋友。

1701
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,047
你只是在玩我最好的朋友的一部分。

1702
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,965
是啊。

1703
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,646
疤面煞星昨晚甚至没有??在电视上。

1704
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,765
你真是一坨屎。

1705
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,603
- 他妈的！ - 去你妈的。

1706
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,688
- 他妈的。 - 小母狗。

1707
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,324
嗯，这为我们节省了旅途。

1708
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,967
在所有我们做了违法的狗屎，

1709
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,007
所有的谎言，我们告诉政府，

1710
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,000
最终，事情确实是我们？

1711
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,086
是的，我试图达到美国国防部，请。

1712
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,886
埃夫拉伊姆从未支付的箱子家伙。

1713
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,047
为了谁做你报案？

1714
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,724
之后恩维尔称为五角大楼，

1715
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,446
国务院开展了全面调查，

1716
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,489
这持续了几个月。

1717
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:38,206
他们破获拉尔夫在他的工作一天中的商店之一。

1718
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,643
他被吓坏了，无法做出处理速度不够快。

1719
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,084
所有这一切废话关于他想调解埃夫拉伊姆和我之间的停火协议...

1720
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,406
这是一个设置。

1721
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,204
哦，是的，我们采取了钱，你给了我们，

1722
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,125
我们买了100万发中国非法弹药，

1723
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,563
那么，我们重新包装，并将其出售给美国军方。

1724
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,490
他们把我们死的权利。

1725
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,370
这是可悲的。

1726
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,811
虽然经历埃夫拉伊姆的电脑，他们甚至发现了一个待办事项中说，

1727
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,082
“改头换面中国弹药”。

1728
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,486
这个故事今晚有五角大楼官员争先恐后。

1729
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,607
两个20多岁的年轻人是怎么降落一个大合同五角大楼？

1730
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,929
联邦特工上周逮捕了两人，欺诈他们充电

1731
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:25,249
出售过时的，有缺陷的中国弹药

1732
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,845
五角大楼。

1733
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,967
埃夫拉伊姆被控超过70联邦罪

1734
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,567
并判处四年徒刑。

1735
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,762
我认罪，被判处七个月软禁。

1736
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:47,403
大会呼吁阿富汗承包的案例研究

1737
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,002
在所有的错与政府的采购过程。

1738
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:05,809
在2022年，AEY将有资格再次竞标美国联邦合同。

1739
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,800
怎么样了？

1740
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,841
没关系。

1741
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,364
如果我想你死了，你早就死了。

1742
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,246
我想它会没事的话。

1743
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,766
进来。

1744
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,964
请问，你的宝宝吗？

1745
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,650
这是一个女孩，对不对？

1746
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,729
是啊。她是很好的。

1747
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,891
我有三个。

1748
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,246
所有的女孩。

1749
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,570
他们告诉你，它变得更好。

1750
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,967
这是不正确的，它会变得更糟。

1751
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,250
这就是为什么我喜欢的军火生意。

1752
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,647
没有女性。

1753
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,440
我想了解阿尔巴尼亚道歉。

1754
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,641
我有不好的信息。

1755
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,890
所以，你我塞进一辆汽车的后备箱，并错误地在我脸上猛的一炮？

1756
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,127
是啊。

1757
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,443
我不是一个坏人，但在某些情况下，

1758
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,085
我不得不问自己，

1759
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,648
什么会坏男人吗？

1760
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,884
我很欣赏你离开我的名字从你的证词。

1761
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,048
我真的不明白了一个道理，包括它。

1762
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,765
是的，但仍。

1763
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,531
我可以问你一个问题吗？

1764
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,321
当然。

1765
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,486
当我们在拉斯维加斯见面了在酒杯表，

1766
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,605
是巧合？

1767
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,249
你有什么感想？

1768
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,484
我能问你一个问题吗？

1769
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,965
我在阿尔巴尼亚司机失踪。

1770
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
你知道他怎么了？

1771
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,764
这是我的一块在阿富汗的交易结束。

1772
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,931
这是给你的。

1773
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,768
没有更多的问题。

1
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,963
Please! Please!

2
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,091
I'm sorry, I don't speak Albanian!

3
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,770
Stop! I don't understand!

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,205
Do you understand now?

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,763
That's a Jericho 941 pointed at my head.

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,250
You can get one on the black market for $300.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,441
Yeah.

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,041
It is a very reliable weapon.

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,002
My name is David Packouz.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,407
And I'm an international arms dealer.

11
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,727
What do you know about war?

12
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,362
They'll tell you it's about patriotism, democracy

13
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,080
or some shit about the other guy hating our freedom.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,287
But you want to know what it's really about?

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,530
What do you see?

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,446
A kid from Arkansas doing his patriotic duty to defend his country?

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,248
I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves,

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,408
body armor, and an M16.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,651
I see $17,500.

20
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,971
That's what it costs to outfit one American soldier.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,201
Over two million soldiers

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,289
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
It cost the American taxpayer $4.5 billion each year

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,284
just to pay the air conditioning bills

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,130
for those wars.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,248
And that's what war is really about.

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,002
War is an economy.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,371
Anybody who tells you otherwise

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,967
is either in on it or stupid.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,484
But I didn't know that yet.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,726
Back then, I didn't know anything.

32
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,930
You can't park here.

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,006
Hey, man. I just got a client at 2150, Mr. Shore.

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,846
I'm a few minutes early.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,168
Yeah? It's a gated community.

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,526
You still can't park here.

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,402
You probably shouldn't smoke that here, either.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,201
Okay. Thanks.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,480
There's a lot I could say about this period in my life

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,842
that would give context to this story.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,401
I could tell you how

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,443
I dropped out of college after one semester.

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,930
- How's that left quad doing?  - It's still sore.

44
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,481
Had a falling out with my parents.

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,729
How I either quit or got fired from six different jobs.

46
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,527
- That's it.  - All right. There we go.

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,326
But looking back I think the most important thing to understand is

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,401
I was completely lost.

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,891
Sorry. It fell.

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,884
That's okay, Gary.

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,450
I was 22 years old

52
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,725
massaging rich dudes in Miami Beach for 75 bucks an hour.

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,324
But I'd had enough.

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,807
It was time to change shit up.

55
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,362
And I had a big idea.

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,405
My plan was to sell quality bed sheets wholesale

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,523
to all the retirement homes in South Florida.

58
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,370
And there were hundreds of them.

59
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,609
- It feels really soft.  - It should.

60
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,087
It's Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count.

61
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,011
I mean, it's pretty much top of the line for institutional use.

62
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,722
I don't know. It seems excessive.

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,407
Well, at $29 per unit, it's far from excessive.

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,571
David, do you know the average age of a resident here at Hilldale?

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,046
Um, no, I don't.

66
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,447
- Eighty-two years old.  - Wow.

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,846
Have you ever seen the skin on an 82-year-old man?

68
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,168
Have you ever felt it?

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,289
Yeah. Actually, I'm a certified massage therapist

70
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,124
and a lot of my clients are elderly.

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,407
Then you should know.

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,410
These sheets,

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,082
it would be like wrapping a lizard in cashmere.

74
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,971
Would you do that?

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,170
Would you wrap a lizard in cashmere?

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,568
I guess not.

77
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,127
Then why would you expect me to?

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,248
My nephew.

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,285
He's good, right?

80
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,208
I'd sunk my entire life savings into 65 cases of premium bed sheets

81
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
but I overlooked one crucial factor.

82
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,646
No one really cares about old people.

83
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,481
Why don't you just sell them back?

84
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,251
It doesn't work like that. I bought them in bulk.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,525
I'm so fucked.

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,165
You're not fucked.

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,010
Pete's fucked.

88
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,489
He's dead.

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,967
Holy shit. Is that Efraim?

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,440
Yeah.

91
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,048
I thought he was still in LA.

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,926
Me too.

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,730
- He was a great friend.  - Thank you.

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,205
He looks so tan.

95
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,602
Efraim Diveroli was my best friend growing up.

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,808
But I hadn't seen him since he was shipped off to live with his uncle in 10th grade.

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,162
I think our parents wanted to keep us as far apart as possible.

98
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,367
There is no table of contents in the Book of Life.

99
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,767
We don't know if we're at the beginning of a new chapter, or the end of a story.

100
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,847
Which is why we must be grateful every time the page turns.

101
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,250
Did you come back just for this?

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,761
Fuck no! I barely knew Pete.

103
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,849
I was hoping to see you here.

104
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,008
You know your mom wouldn't give me your number?

105
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,247
What, did you call my house?

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,727
No, I was fucking her.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,844
She still hates me, huh?

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,485
Yeah, most likely.

109
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,205
I missed you, bro.

110
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,521
Yeah, me too.

111
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,650
Let's go for a ride.

112
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,927
Uh...

113
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,009
I can't. I got a client at 4:00.

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,890
Fuck that shit. Cancel it.

115
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,650
Your boy's back in town.

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,171
Come on!

117
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,926
So, what happened with LA, man?

118
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,121
Why did you move back?

119
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,203
Oh, you know I was working for my uncle, right?

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,971
Yeah, I heard that you were, like, a gun dealer or something.

121
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,121
Pretty much. I mean,

122
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,648
we'd buy seized weapons at police auctions and resell them on the Internet.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,841
Cool.

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,801
It was cool until my uncle scumbagged me over 70 grand.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,764
Holy shit. Seventy grand?

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,804
Whatever. Fuck him. I made a bunch of money.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,890
I decided I'd come back to Miami, start up my own shop.

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
Cool.

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,811
Yo, where's this guy live?

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,162
It's, like, five more minutes. You got somewhere you gotta be?

131
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,887
No.

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,407
All right. So, I can't figure out which is worse.

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,807
The fact that you sell bed sheets to old age homes

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,644
or that you jerk guys off for money.

135
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,322
For the record, I'm a licensed massage therapist, okay?

136
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,851
Totally legit.

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,249
Okay. But at the end, the guys have to come, right?

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,885
Like, on your chest or whatever?

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,082
You know what? Fuck you.

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,089
Fuck you, buddy.

141
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,045
Bro, do you remember the last time we went to buy weed together?

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,288
Of course I do. It was fucking traumatic.

143
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,046
Yeah, but do you remember the next day, when we walked into school

144
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,208
and everybody knew that we got arrested?

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,323
Yeah, we were gangsters, bro.

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,841
We thought we ran South Beach.

147
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,849
We did run yeshiva.

148
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,849
We didn't take shit from anyone.

149
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,646
Yeah, I miss that.

150
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,127
You miss yeshiva?

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,129
No, I miss

152
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,522
not taking shit from anyone.

153
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,401
Yo!

154
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,686
He out. You looking for weed?

155
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,202
Depends. You got good shit?

156
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,364
Put it this way. I sell him his shit.

157
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,644
What's up with this nigga, man?

158
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,285
Cool. Can you do an ounce?

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,767
Yeah, no sweat. Three bills.

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,211
Three hundred. I like it.

161
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,721
You get the better price when you come direct to the distributor.

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,365
I guess so.

163
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,686
All right.

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,401
Yeah, so, she opened the door.

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,289
And I'm like, "Yo. Chill. I ain't about that drama."

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,521
You know what I mean?

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,881
"I know you got another nigga in the crib."

168
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,206
What's up?

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,201
What?

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,285
Can I get the shit?

171
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,811
What shit?

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,601
I just gave you $300 for some weed.

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,205
Any of you niggas ever seen this motherfucker before?

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,566
I ain't seen shit.

175
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,202
Man, get the fuck out of here.

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,166
- All right. All right, okay.  - Yeah, yeah.

177
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,241
This white boy wild.

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,726
Parachute pants.

179
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,485
Looking like Jay Leno and shit.

180
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,405
Look like he going to church.

181
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,051
Yo, yo, hold up, hold up, man.

182
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,526
- What the fuck.  - Shit!

183
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,880
Come on! Where's everybody going?

184
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,923
I thought we were gonna hang out.

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,525
What a bunch of assholes.

186
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,490
What the fuck was that? Are you crazy?

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,641
It's cool, bro.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,451
I have a Class 3 Firearms license.

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,530
- Huh?  - Come on, get in.

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,370
I know another dealer nearby.

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,286
It's weird. We were the same age, but I always looked up to Efraim.

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,726
When life kicked me, I stayed down.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,083
But not Efraim. He kicked back.

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,123
Mr. President, we want to thank you

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,731
for visiting us here today.

196
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,207
We are honored to be serving our country,

197
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,044
and proud to welcome you,

198
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,447
our wartime Commander in Chief...

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,762
- Hey.  - Hey, sweetie.

200
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,610
How was the funeral?

201
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,643
It was amazing.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,690
Oh, my God. You're so stoned, aren't you?

203
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,450
Huh? What?

204
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,246
You just described a funeral as "amazing."

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,727
What? No. The funeral was really sad.

206
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,883
Yeah, everyone was totally bummed out.

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,401
But I ran into my friend from growing up.

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,841
The guy I told you about. Efraim Diveroli?

209
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,649
The one you got arrested with?

210
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,328
Yeah. I mean, we did some other stuff too, but...

211
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,722
Anyway, he just moved back to Miami.

212
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,285
That's great, right?

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah. I'm supposed to swing by his office tomorrow.

214
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,770
We're gonna grab lunch.

215
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,324
- Okay.  - Are you hungry?

216
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,760
- Hmm?  - I'm so hungry.

217
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,641
- We don't have much here.  - Oh.

218
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,002
- I mean, we have pizza.  - Really?

219
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,924
- And nachos.  - We have nachos?

220
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,730
And ice cream.

221
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,207
Wait, what? We never have ice cream.

222
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,049
You're fucking with me, aren't you?

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,931
That is so mean.

224
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,250
That was so easy.

225
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,121
Hello?

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,971
Hello, Mr. Borstein. This is David Packouz.

227
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,685
You told me to call today at 11:00.

228
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,521
I have those bed sheets with me, and I would love for you to take a look.

229
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,285
Uh, sir, if you give me the chance

230
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,369
I am confident that your residents

231
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,971
will appreciate the difference.

232
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,921
It's an expense we can't justify, and we're just not interested.

233
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,366
Uh-huh.

234
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,762
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
Yeah, this is contract specialist

236
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,806
Lindsey Michaels from Army Command, Picatinny.

237
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,571
That's right.

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,890
Yeah, I sent out a solicitation for some 249s for Basra

239
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,447
and we seem to have misplaced your paperwork.

240
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,642
Great. So if you can go ahead and just re-email me those numbers.

241
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,047
Actually, you know what? On second thought,

242
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,890
we're about to make a decision on those RFPs.

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,367
Why don't you go ahead and just give me your bid while I got you here on the phone?

244
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,447
Uh-huh.

245
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,245
And does that include mags?

246
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,088
Great. Yes, sir.

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,200
You keep supplying the guns, we'll keep killing the bad guys.

248
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,285
God bless you.

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,970
What a fucking tool. What's up, bro?

250
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,367
Yo, what's up, man? What was that all about?

251
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,682
Oh, that was me impersonating an army officer.

252
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,689
Really? What for?

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,042
To find out what my competitor's bidding on a contract.

254
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,050
It's fucking genius.

255
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,688
I thought that you said you sold, like, seized weapons to gun nuts on the Internet.

256
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,006
Not anymore.

257
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,969
Now I only sell to one gun nut.

258
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,531
Oh, yeah? Which one?

259
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,483
The U.S. Military, motherfucker.

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,010
Wanna do a bong hit?

261
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,606
Pretty sick, huh?

262
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,201
So what, you sell these things to the Pentagon?

263
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,767
I sell all kinds of shit to the Pentagon.

264
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,725
Guns, bullets, body armor.

265
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,369
Last week, I shipped 400 gas masks to American Special Forces in Iraq.

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,881
No shit.

267
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,523
How long you been doing this for?

268
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,245
Two, three months.

269
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,408
And you make good money?

270
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,729
Oh! Fuck, man.

271
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,725
Put it this way. I did over 200K in the past eight weeks.

272
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,162
And I'm only telling you that because you're my boy.

273
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,486
I'm not bragging.

274
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,085
Holy shit.

275
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,725
Yeah. Check this out.

276
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,450
Fed Biz Opps stands for Federal Business Opportunities.

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,768
Think eBay, but for war.

278
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
- They buy tanks on here?  - Bro, they buy everything on here.

279
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,521
It was crazy.

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,802
The government had a public website

281
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,447
containing every military contract currently up for bidding.

282
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,126
But I skip the big ticket items, and look for the small-ball shit

283
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,601
that giant defense contractors ignore.

284
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,121
Everybody's fighting over the same pie.

285
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,845
But they're ignoring the crumbs.

286
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,481
I live on crumbs, like a rat.

287
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,328
And when you're dealing with the Pentagon, crumbs are worth millions.

288
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,321
These listings seemed to go on forever.

289
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,246
And according to Efraim, they did.

290
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,402
Thanks, man.

291
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,241
So, I don't get it.

292
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,090
If there's an entire defense industry,

293
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,124
why would the Pentagon want to buy anything from you?

294
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,931
They don't want to, they have to.

295
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,531
Remember Little League?

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,604
How, at the end of the season, they'd give out that big MVP trophy

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,165
and that one kid would always win it?

298
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,646
Yeah, Evan Talbot.

299
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,286
Right. But then, one year, somebody's mom complained?

300
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,802
Then they had to give everybody a little trophy so they wouldn't feel bad?

301
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,804
Even that fat retarded kid, Robbie Friedman, got one.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,002
That's kind of like what's happening here.

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,284
I'm still confused, man.

304
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,643
The Pentagon fucked up when they were rebuilding the Iraqi Army.

305
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,010
They gave all these no-bid contracts to Cheney's boys, and they got caught.

306
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,686
So Bush started this initiative to level the playing field

307
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,322
and now every Pentagon purchase, every gun, every grenade,

308
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,246
every bullet, gets offered to small businesses for bidding.

309
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,330
And sure, the big dogs still get the big trophies.

310
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,847
But the Pentagon's got to give little trophies

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
to all the Robbie Friedmans of the world.

312
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,728
So, basically, you're a fat retarded kid.

313
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,566
Bro, I'm the fattest and most retarded.

314
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,568
In a speech today, President Bush said that contrary to reports

315
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,684
he has no plans to attack Iran.

316
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,571
The President said, "That's ridiculous.

317
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,081
"We didn't even have plans when we attacked Iraq. "

318
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,161
David.

319
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,521
Yeah?

320
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,887
Remember a few weeks ago, in the car on the way home from my mom's house?

321
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,367
Yes. Yes, I do.

322
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,486
Well, this happened.

323
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,164
How the fuck are you going to feed a baby?

324
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,170
Have you even thought about this?

325
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,361
What are you going to do?

326
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,085
Jerk men off the rest of your life?

327
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,841
Yeah, that's the plan. I'm gonna feed my kid by jerking men off.

328
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,566
Sorry.

329
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,723
Okay, good. Well, at least you thought it through.

330
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,445
It's not funny.

331
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,601
Dude, I am so fucked.

332
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,928
I think you should come work for me.

333
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,890
What are you talking about?

334
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,003
Seriously, I need the help.

335
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,326
David, look at me.

336
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,168
Bush opened the floodgates in Iraq.

337
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,210
It's a fucking gold rush.

338
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,171
That's really nice of you, Efraim.

339
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,203
Fuck nice! Who cares about nice?

340
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,368
I've been looking to bring somebody on for a while now.

341
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,040
The problem is, I don't trust anyone.

342
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,530
But you're my boy.

343
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,127
I mean, no offense, but I'm against this war.

344
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,041
Me and Iz are going to rallies and signing petitions.

345
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,890
Yeah, dude, I'm against the war too.

346
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,605
I fucking hate Bush.

347
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,205
But this isn't about being pro-war.

348
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,448
The war is happening.

349
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,688
This is about being pro-money.

350
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,770
The more Efraim talked, the more it made sense.

351
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,928
Besides, compared to my other prospects,

352
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,487
this was the chance of a lifetime.

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,287
My only issue was, what would I tell Iz?

354
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,568
I think it's a great idea.

355
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,565
So I lied.

356
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,525
You know I've always believed in this business.

357
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,726
I told her that Efraim had great contacts in the government.

358
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,485
And instead of selling bed sheets

359
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,808
to penny-pinching retirement homes

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,480
we'd now be selling sheets to the free-spending,

361
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,768
overfunded U.S. Military.

362
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,530
It's genius.

363
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,769
I had to lie. Iz hated the war.

364
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,965
She had two cousins serving in Iraq.

365
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,525
She also hated the mountain of bed sheets that were taking up half our apartment.

366
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,204
I spent the next six weeks in a crash course on arms dealing.

367
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,323
The Herstal 556 light machine gun.

368
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,727
Belgian, but made under license in lots of places.

369
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,725
When it came to this shit, Efraim knew everything.

370
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,089
Makes, models, weights, where it was made.

371
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,965
Remember, there's been an arms embargo against China since Tiananmen Square.

372
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,081
And if there was an angle to be played, he knew about that too.

373
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,362
You have to read between the lines with this stuff.

374
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,171
All the money is made between the lines.

375
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,286
I'd spend my entire day scouring the government's website,

376
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,161
searching for overlooked contracts that we could squeeze our way into.

377
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,564
Hey, I think I got something.

378
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,770
Hey, Georgia, I gotta call you back.

379
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,405
And then, in the middle of the night

380
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,841
we'd be back in the office, working the phones.

381
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,361
Forging relationships

382
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,962
with weapon manufacturers all over Eastern Europe.

383
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,766
No, David Packouz from AEY.

384
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,889
I told Iz we were doing conference calls with sheet suppliers in Pakistan.

385
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,242
They called guys like us war dogs.

386
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,681
Bottom feeders who make money off of war

387
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,087
without ever stepping foot on the battlefield.

388
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,162
It was meant to be derogatory, but we kinda liked it.

389
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,125
You fucking scumbag piece of shit!

390
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,484
Drown, motherfucker, drown!

391
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,041
Very nice.

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,682
Ralph Slutsky was Efraim's silent partner.

393
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,571
He was a local businessman

394
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,809
who owned 14 dry cleaners all across Miami.

395
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,930
Why didn't anybody tell me the mister is broken?

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,929
Ralph put up the money to back the deals in exchange for 25% of the company.

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,327
Or at least what he thought was 25%.

398
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,802
We're doing God's work, Ralph.

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,809
We really are.

400
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,048
You know, every Jew owes a debt to Israel.

401
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,846
In my mind, this is not a metaphorical debt.

402
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,209
Ralph was under the impression that Efraim was an observant Jew

403
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,851
who only dealt arms as a means

404
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,963
to protect Israel from her enemies.

405
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,804
Beautifully said.

406
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,447
Did you happen to catch last Friday's Torah portion?

407
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,286
- One of my favorites.  - Same here.

408
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,086
It reminds me so much of this story I once read.

409
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,965
About a young man traveling to Pinsk.

410
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,647
And that was Efraim's genius.

411
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,202
He would figure out who someone wanted him to be

412
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,290
and he would become that person.

413
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,646
Ah!

414
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,441
And he's got, like, 20,000 of them.

415
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,290
Great. Where did you find this guy?

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,568
You remember Victor in the Ukraine?

417
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,046
Yeah, the one with the Mk3s?

418
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,204
Yeah. He turned me on to this company in Cyprus.

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,801
It's run by this guy, Henry Girard.

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,081
Henry Girard?

421
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,446
Yeah, you know him?

422
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,722
You spoke to Henry Girard?

423
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,167
A couple of times. Why? Who is he?

424
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,887
Dude, for the last 20 years, this guy has basically supplied

425
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,447
both sides of every conflict on the planet.

426
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,165
He's a fucking animal.

427
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,045
Really? Why is he calling me?

428
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,129
Because he's a fucking animal.

429
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,171
It's all money and it all matters.

430
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,124
Hey, mami, where are you going?

431
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,364
I'm trying to find my friends.

432
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,886
You want to make some money?

433
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,241
Excuse me?

434
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,847
I'll give you $1,000 right now

435
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,929
if we fast forward to our third date.

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,691
What does that even mean?

437
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,248
It means we just had a great dinner, maybe met your friends for some drinks

438
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,249
and now you're about to blow me in my car.

439
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,805
Can we just get right to that part?

440
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,451
Who the fuck are you?

441
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,005
Efraim Diveroli.

442
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,281
That's my best friend, David.

443
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,084
And we're international arms dealers.

444
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,406
But you already know that

445
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,409
because we're on our third date.

446
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,124
- What's going on?  - Nothing, bro.

447
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,970
I'm about to get out of here with my girl.

448
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,684
What the fuck, man!

449
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,363
Oh, my God.

450
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,363
That guy was not fucking around.

451
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,728
Yeah, you probably should have picked a different girl.

452
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,526
Fuck that, it almost worked.

453
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,442
Hey, do you remember when you fought Eric Moscowitz in sixth grade?

454
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,047
Yeah, he did that windmill thing with his arms.

455
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,208
That was the sickest. He was unbeatable.

456
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,890
You remember that shit?

457
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,125
That's it.

458
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,243
Dude, he would have killed me if you didn't jump in.

459
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,530
Probably. Mmm.

460
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,685
Hey, I never said "thank you."

461
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,924
For everything.

462
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,123
Come on, you know how much you've helped me out lately.

463
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,604
It's cool. You don't have to make it weird, all right?

464
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,130
Hey, can we order some food?

465
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,483
Mami, come on. I could have gone to Cuba and back.

466
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,569
Met the family, grabbed a couple sandwiches.

467
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,886
I'd be done by now.

468
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,281
Hello?

469
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,323
Yes, sir. Sorry, I wasn't expecting a work call this late.

470
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,091
Right, of course. It's 9:00 a.m. in Baghdad.

471
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,721
Who is it?

472
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,122
That's great news, Captain Santos.

473
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,526
Yes, sir.

474
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,966
We're going to get right on that.

475
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,241
Thank you. Bye.

476
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,441
What?

477
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,321
We just got the Beretta deal.

478
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,766
Get the fuck out of here.

479
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,281
I swear to God.

480
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,363
The Beretta deal was massive.

481
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,360
It was 10 times bigger than anything we'd closed so far.

482
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,562
This was next level shit.

483
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,410
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

484
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,967
That's real money, motherfucker! Fuck!

485
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,369
Do you realize we're going to make 600K

486
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,891
on this fucking thing?

487
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,121
Holy shit.

488
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,086
David, your 30% is $180,000.

489
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,403
Holy fucking shit!

490
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
It was amazing.

491
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,890
I'd been working with Efraim for two months

492
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,162
and was already about to make more money

493
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,124
than a lifetime of massages.

494
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,881
Listen.

495
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,206
What is that?

496
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,845
That's your baby's heartbeat.

497
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,807
Wow.

498
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,243
Can you believe how fast it is?

499
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,328
- Is that normal?  - Totally normal.

500
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,490
Fetuses have a much faster heart rate than we do.

501
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,401
Look.

502
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,281
So, you guys want to know the sex?

503
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,530
We keep going back and forth on it.

504
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,083
- What do you think?  - Um...

505
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,009
This is work. I have to take it.

506
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,281
I'm so sorry.

507
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,646
This is David.

508
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,649
This is Captain Santos in Baghdad

509
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,002
checking on the delivery status of my Berettas.

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,924
Captain, good to hear from you.

511
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,288
Yes, we are on target. All good.

512
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
Great. I was worried

513
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,601
those guns were coming direct out of Italy.

514
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,882
Absolutely. They are, sir.

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,082
Packouz, please tell me

516
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,931
you're aware of the legislation the Italians passed last week.

517
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,801
The one banning all arms shipments to Iraq.

518
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,931
I had no clue what he was talking about.

519
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,851
But this was a huge fucking problem.

520
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,889
Berettas are an Italian gun.

521
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,890
Made and manufactured in Italy.

522
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,121
Uh...

523
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,646
Of course.

524
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,251
I am. I've been on the phone

525
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,403
for the last three days, making other arrangements.

526
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,285
Great. That's what I wanted to hear.

527
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,926
Iraqi police force is depending on you.

528
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,361
Well, you tell them AEY has got them covered.

529
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,291
- Outstanding.  - Thanks, Captain. Talk soon.

530
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,090
Everything okay?

531
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,481
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

532
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,209
What happened? We done already?

533
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,085
Yeah. Guess what?

534
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,885
It's a girl.

535
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,121
Baby.

536
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,725
Okay. At least I hit something.

537
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,843
Seriously, what the fuck are we going to do?

538
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,810
Relax, bro.

539
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,247
Should I just call him back and tell him the truth?

540
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,491
When does telling the truth ever help anybody?

541
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,648
Efraim, we can't dick around with this guy

542
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,927
and then not deliver.

543
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,566
We're going to deliver.
I already figured it out.

544
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,847
We use Jordan.

545
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,766
Jordan Goldfarb?

546
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,961
Jordan...

547
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,525
Jordan the country.

548
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,161
It shares a border with Iraq. It's a U.S. ally.

549
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,966
And most importantly, there's no embargo.

550
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,129
Okay, so what do we tell the Italians?

551
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,129
Fuck them! As far as they're concerned

552
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,603
they're sending 5,000 Berettas to a country they have no issue with.

553
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,087
All we have to do is ship the guns

554
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,004
from Jordan to Baghdad.

555
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,651
It's called circumvention.

556
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,201
Is that legal?

557
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,486
It's not illegal.

558
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,761
Want to try?

559
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,406
How did that charity thing go?

560
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,931
It was 5K, right?

561
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,770
It was supposed to be a 5K.

562
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,008
Uh, I finished about 1 K of it.

563
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,248
So, I should probably return four-fifths of the money.

564
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,850
So, Andrew told me

565
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,361
you and Efraim are working together now?

566
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,881
Really?

567
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,969
Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing.

568
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,648
Yeah. Efraim has some contacts with the government.

569
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,889
So we're just combining forces right now.

570
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,401
Yeah, just... Just be careful with him.

571
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,568
- Emily, don't.  - What?

572
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
How do you mean?

573
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,891
Well, his cousin, Rebecca, is an old friend of mine.

574
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,451
We went to camp together.

575
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,008
And she told me that he stole $70,000 from her father.

576
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,725
Whoa, really?

577
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,961
That's interesting.

578
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,730
I actually heard it was the other way around.

579
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,566
That his uncle is the one who stole the money from him.

580
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,040
See? You don't know.

581
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,571
Everyone has their own version of a story.

582
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,325
No, I'm pretty certain.

583
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,409
Their whole family stopped talking to him over it.

584
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,450
Yo! Why aren't you answering your phone?

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,291
Hey, what's up, man?

586
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,161
Fuck is this?

587
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,489
Everyone, this is David's business partner, Efraim.

588
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,843
- Hey, man.  - Hey, man.

589
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,690
Bro, could I talk to you outside for a minute?

590
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,405
- It's urgent.  - Yeah, of course.

591
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,447
And for the record, I'm also his best friend,

592
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,166
so probably should have been invited to whatever this is.

593
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,445
Look, these are her friends. This is her dinner party.

594
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,768
Rosen is her friend now? That Jew fuck?

595
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
Trust me, you don't want to be here.

596
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,771
I don't want to be here, all right?

597
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,521
Now, what's going on?

598
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,444
Jordanian customs seized our Berettas.

599
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,962
- What? Why?   - I don't fucking know, David.

600
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,089
I dropped out of high school before they covered international diplomacy.

601
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,761
- Who's that?  - Fuck, it's Santos.

602
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,007
He knows!

603
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,006
Pick it up, I want to listen.

604
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,646
- Pick... Pick up the fucking phone.  - This is David.

605
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,161
Yeah, I just heard my guns are being held up in Jordan.

606
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,370
Captain Santos, yes, there's been a slight hiccup.

607
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,891
What are they even doing in Jordan?

608
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,121
Not to worry.

609
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,687
They're in a hangar in Amman. Totally safe.

610
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,571
My team and I are working on a solution right now.

611
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,285
You didn't answer my question.

612
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,289
What the fuck are my guns doing in Jordan?

613
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,243
Captain Santos, this is Efraim Diveroli.

614
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,090
President of AEY, sir.

615
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,290
David has apprised me of the situation and we are looking at options as we speak.

616
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,720
Options? What kind of options?

617
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,891
Well, are you familiar with the Corvus TP1 9?

618
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,048
That's Brazilian and it's shit.

619
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,481
Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas.

620
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,762
Sir, I need you to work with us a little on this.

621
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,961
Let me get this straight.

622
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,491
I'm in the ass crack of the world, defending your freedom.

623
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,603
And I got to work with you shit bags?

624
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,041
Look, I don't know

625
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,171
if those Berettas are really in Amman or if you're just trying to goose your profits

626
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,569
like every other piece of shit in your miserable, rat-fuck profession.

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,366
Either way, you're endangering my mission.

628
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,607
I'm shutting you down.

629
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,484
I'm canceling you for cause.

630
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,244
Getting canceled for cause was a death sentence.

631
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,051
It meant we would never win another contract.

632
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,770
Captain, please do not do that.

633
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,731
I know you're upset.

634
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,843
But from one Christian to another

635
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,129
my wife and I are having serious financial problems.

636
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,370
Our son, Lucas, is in the hospital.

637
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,767
Medical bills are through the roof.

638
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,205
If you do this, it'll ruin me. It'll ruin my family.

639
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,521
As God as my witness,

640
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,648
I will get you your guns.

641
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,841
Hello?

642
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,767
What a fucking piece of shit! Do you believe this fucking guy?

643
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,240
- Fuck.  - What's going on?

644
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,729
What guns, David?

645
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,443
Are you fucking kidding me?

646
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,200
You told me you guys were selling bed sheets.

647
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,210
Yeah, and I also told you that we're selling other stuff too.

648
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,164
I thought you meant pillows!

649
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,371
Look, I can't support a kid by giving massages.

650
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,369
Okay? And nobody was buying the bed sheets.

651
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,164
No, David, you lied to me.

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Because I know how you feel about the war.

653
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,563
I thought we both felt that way!

654
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,170
I'm five months pregnant!

655
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,249
And it's a problem if I can't trust the man

656
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,521
I'm having a baby with!

657
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,848
- Of course you can trust me.  - Really?

658
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,805
Because five minutes ago, I didn't even know you were an arms dealer!

659
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,605
I'm not an arms dealer.

660
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,330
What we do is perfectly legal.

661
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,768
We work for the government. We're middlemen.

662
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,167
We don't touch the guns, we don't see the guns.

663
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,647
We never even leave the office.

664
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,444
Hey, sorry to interrupt. It's time sensitive.

665
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,806
David, do you have a passport?

666
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,529
What? Yeah, why?

667
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,961
We have to go to Jordan. Like, ASAP.

668
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,571
Straighten this shit out.

669
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,205
We gotta talk, whatever, okay?

670
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,601
Yeah.

671
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,041
Yo, you window or aisle?

672
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,043
- Excuse me, sorry.  - Yeah, we just landed.

673
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,850
- Excuse me.  - The Embassy call?

674
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,731
Excuse me. Okay, bye.

675
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,050
- Sorry, kind of an emergency.  - Excuse me. Sorry.

676
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,969
Don't worry, I have to go first. I'm American.

677
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,321
I'm sorry.

678
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,969
The American Embassy offered little to no help

679
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
in dealing with the Ministry of Customs.

680
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,888
So we took matters into our own hands.

681
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,729
He says your permit has expired

682
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,406
and that you can't fly your crates out of Jordan without one.

683
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,204
Yeah, we know. That's why we're here.

684
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,082
Look, we were told that you know people in the government,

685
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,165
that maybe you can help us out.

686
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,971
He says it will take six weeks to get a new permit.

687
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,003
Yeah, that's the issue. We don't have six weeks.

688
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,770
We need our guns today.

689
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,411
Look, I don't want to come off as the ugly American here.

690
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,161
And maybe I don't understand the rituals of your culture

691
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,691
but this feels like the moment

692
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,848
where we are supposed to offer him a gift, am I correct?

693
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,770
- You are correct.  - All right.

694
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,362
$1,400 U.S. Cool?

695
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,361
Cool, man.

696
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,684
Could have just started with that, you know, saved all this bullshit.

697
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,881
I like your shades.

698
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,770
Tell him I'll give him 100 bucks for those shades.

699
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,166
Tell him in gibberish.

700
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,969
No way. Alligator.

701
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,049
Yeah, I know. I...

702
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,806
It's Lacoste. It's actually a crocodile.

703
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,964
I like fancy shit, that's my thing.

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,611
Tell him.

705
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,084
For three days, we didn't hear anything.

706
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,245
It was ridiculous.

707
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,525
Our entire business was riding on the word of an 11-year-old translator.

708
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,443
Motherfucker! He ripped us off!

709
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,811
We don't know that yet.

710
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,207
No! I know what it feels like to fuck somebody.

711
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,641
I also know what it feels like to get fucked by somebody.

712
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,251
And we just got fucked.

713
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,887
You need to chill out.

714
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,724
How am I supposed to chill out, David?

715
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,241
We're in a Muslim country, I can't even get a blowjob!

716
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,005
It's embarrassing!

717
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,161
It's chaos here! Fuck!

718
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,201
Yeah.

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,001
Right now?

720
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,525
We're coming down.

721
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,290
That was Aladdin. They're in the lobby.

722
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,721
See that? Come on.

723
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,081
Hold on. Are you fucking kidding me?

724
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,321
What's the problem?

725
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,888
You wanted your guns back, he got you your guns back.

726
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,402
What? No, we said we needed a permit to fly them to Iraq.

727
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,082
Exactly, but you don't need a permit to drive them.

728
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,604
You expect us to drive them to Iraq?

729
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,085
Why not? Marlboro is the best smuggler in all of Jordan.

730
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,561
Who, this?

731
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,406
This is the best smuggler in all of Jordan?

732
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,725
Yeah, he drives to Baghdad three, four times a month.

733
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,206
Efraim, you want to weigh in here?

734
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,408
Yo, how far is it to Baghdad?

735
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,451
- Why are you asking him that?  - 800 kilometers.

736
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,846
And he knows what he's doing?

737
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,446
Efraim, stop.

738
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,608
- 100% the best.  - Come on.

739
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,684
It's like 500 miles. We'll be there by morning.

740
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,360
You seriously want to drive to Baghdad?

741
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,331
David, we're gunrunners.

742
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,325
Let's go run some fucking guns.

743
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,961
Let's go.

744
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,765
Come on.

745
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,361
Hey, seriously, is this safe? Driving to Baghdad?

746
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,528
Yes, very safe.

747
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,767
50-50.

748
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,561
50-50? What, like 50% we live, 50% we die?

749
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,604
Yes. That is why we drive through night.

750
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,845
It is much safer.

751
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,245
How much safer?

752
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,720
50-50.

753
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,331
Bro, what the fuck!

754
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,484
Obviously, he doesn't know what 50-50 means.

755
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,081
Oh, my God.

756
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,130
Hey, what about gas though? It's a long trip, no?

757
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,490
No problem. Petrol free in Iraq.

758
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,166
No kidding.

759
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,925
- Free gas?   - Yeah.

760
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,244
See what I'm talking about? Iraq is dope.

761
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,128
I'm thinking about getting a place there.

762
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,080
Free gas.

763
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,369
Fucking cool, man.

764
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,001
What is that?

765
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,321
What?

766
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,405
You don't see that?

767
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,925
What the fuck?

768
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,765
Hey, why are you slowing down, man?

769
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,321
It's okay, it's okay.

770
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,208
What's okay?

771
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,004
Whoa, whoa. What the fuck, bro?

772
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,486
It's okay. Border.

773
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,081
What, this?

774
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,206
Fuck.

775
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,641
- Jesus.  - Put down.

776
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,001
- Huh?  - Put down.

777
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,487
Whoa, whoa.

778
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,521
Cigarettes.

779
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,685
For you.

780
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,401
Welcome.

781
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,283
It was fucking surreal.

782
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,165
Six months ago, I was a massage therapist in Miami Beach.

783
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,330
And now, here I was, driving a truckload of guns

784
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,726
through the Iraqi desert

785
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,207
with my best friend from junior high.

786
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,209
Marlboro?

787
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,411
Hey, Marlboro?

788
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,441
Bro!

789
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,445
There's a dead body in the gas station!

790
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,766
What the fuck!

791
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,488
Where are we? Where's Marlboro?

792
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,807
Did you not hear what I just said?

793
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,206
There's a fucking dead body in there, man!

794
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,811
Yes, I heard you.

795
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,411
All right, we're in a war zone, bro.

796
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,244
There's dead bodies, relax.

797
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,444
All right, I gotta take a leak.

798
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,041
What?

799
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,441
Be careful.

800
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,120
I'm good, bro. I know how to take a piss, all right?

801
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,401
Shit.

802
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
Fuck.

803
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,048
- Hello?  - Hey.

804
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,444
Hey, babe, is everything okay?

805
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,641
Yeah.

806
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,445
What time is it there?

807
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,001
It's, uh, 7:30 in the morning.

808
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,684
Shit, did I wake you?

809
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,003
No, I'm just at the hotel. We're about to have some breakfast.

810
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,567
Listen, I'm not saying I like it,

811
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,485
but I get why you're doing this.

812
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,207
You do?

813
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,325
This whole time I never thought about what you must be going through.

814
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,369
All the pressure you're under.

815
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,444
It's just the lying that kills me.

816
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,443
It makes me feel like I'm in this alone.

817
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,566
No, you're not in this alone.

818
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,684
I need you to know that you can tell me anything, David.

819
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,723
We're partners, remember?

820
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,721
David?

821
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,525
Yeah, I gotta call you right back.

822
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,250
- Is everything okay?  - Yeah, everything's fine.

823
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,441
I'm just going to call you right back, okay?

824
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,681
I love you. Bye.

825
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,843
Efraim!

826
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,481
Efraim!

827
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,410
- What?  - Look!

828
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,888
Marlboro!

829
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,251
Fuck! What the fuck, bro.

830
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,726
Holy shit, they have guns, man!

831
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,160
I know!

832
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,486
Go, go! Come on.

833
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,648
What the fuck! It won't start!

834
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,171
Where the fuck is Marlboro?

835
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,442
- I got it!  - Go! Go!

836
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,241
No, no, no!

837
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,770
Wait, wait, wait!

838
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,883
Wait! No!

839
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,610
Run, motherfucker! Jump in!

840
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,245
Holy shit! They're getting closer. Come on, man. Go!

841
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,885
Go, go!

842
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,127
Come on!

843
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,367
Are you kidding me?

844
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,608
We stopped for gas in Fallujah?

845
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,041
You cheap fuck!

846
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,926
Go!

847
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,610
Fuck you, Marlboro!

848
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,481
Fuck.

849
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,525
Fuck. Fuck.

850
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,370
We're gonna die!

851
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,728
You wanted to drive to Baghdad, you asshole!

852
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,847
They're stopping.

853
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,247
What the fuck? Look.

854
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,050
Holy fuck, bro.

855
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,650
Oh, fuck! All right!

856
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,611
God bless Dick Cheney's America!

857
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,326
Look at this fucking place. Oh, my God.

858
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,726
Excuse me, sir?

859
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,921
What?

860
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,645
There are some guys here to see you.

861
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,046
Some guys?

862
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,805
What kind of guys?

863
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,365
Hey, Marlboro!

864
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,603
Give us a smile, gorgeous.

865
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,840
Let me see those pearly yellows.

866
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,766
You're like an Iraqi Tom Selleck, bro.

867
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,370
You guys are AEY?

868
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,684
Yes, sir. David Packouz.

869
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,008
This is my colleague, Efraim Diveroli.

870
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,131
We spoke on the phone.

871
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,766
I remember.

872
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,171
You drove these?

873
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,962
Through the Triangle of Death?

874
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,569
Fucking A right we did.

875
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,969
Kip, take these boys over to the cage, get them paid.

876
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,161
Right away, sir.

877
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,084
I was wrong about you two.

878
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,163
Great fucking job, boys.

879
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,371
Great fucking job.

880
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,804
Holy shit, the Triangle of Death, bro?

881
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,082
That's right. That's the AEY guarantee, bitch.

882
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,602
We drive through all triangles, including your mom's.

883
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,728
Hey, Kip, snap a photo of us, pal.

884
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,921
All right.

885
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,721
Ready?

886
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,081
- How's my hair?  - It's good, slicked back.

887
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,770
Thank you.

888
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,121
- Got you.  - Let me see it.

889
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,161
Helmut fucking Newton over here.

890
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,481
All right, man.

891
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,770
- Perfect.  - All right, all right.

892
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,525
Let's go get fucking paid.

893
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,806
Holy shit.

894
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,362
Crazy, right? $12.2 billion.

895
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,524
It's all seized from the godfather himself.

896
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,041
You guys call Saddam Hussein the godfather?

897
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,120
Look at all this cash, bro. What would you call him?

898
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,845
$2.8 million.

899
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,887
- Just sign here.  - You got it.

900
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,288
We got a military escort to the airport

901
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,046
and got the fuck out of Baghdad.

902
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,326
There was almost $3 million in cash

903
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,761
stuffed into our Army-issued duffel bags.

904
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,448
You might think after barely surviving Iraq

905
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,846
that we'd be done.

906
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,841
But you'd be wrong.

907
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,042
You see, the Beretta deal put us on the map.

908
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,289
After that, we started killing it.

909
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,290
We bought matching Porsches.

910
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,041
We bought two apartments in the same building.

911
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,891
Oh, my God.

912
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,051
Holy shit, bro.

913
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,246
Oh!

914
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,121
Whoo!

915
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,804
Ralph was so happy with his returns

916
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,929
that he increased his original investment

917
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,043
in AEY by $10 million.

918
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,091
That gave us enough capital to pursue more deals

919
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,645
and expand the company.

920
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,088
Which is exactly what we did.

921
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,286
I cannot stress this enough.

922
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,804
You need to be scouring this website.

923
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,286
Day and night.

924
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,491
It is updated by the minute.

925
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,482
There are tens of thousands of solicitations on this website.

926
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,043
Each one is 40 to 50 pages long.

927
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,921
If you see something interesting,

928
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,130
you bring it to me.

929
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,808
If you bring it to me,

930
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,090
I'll make you rich.

931
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,851
Fact, 18 months ago,

932
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,963
David here was jerking off guys for money.

933
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,521
Actually, that is not a fact.

934
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,205
That is absolutely a fact.

935
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,524
Now he drives a Porsche.

936
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,084
And that's all because of AEY.

937
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,401
Do you have any questions?

938
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,203
Um, I have a question.

939
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,248
What does AEY stand for?

940
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,131
What do you mean? Like morally?

941
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,244
No, I mean what do the letters mean?

942
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,324
That's fucking...

943
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,568
What does IBM stand for? Nothing.

944
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,808
It just... It just sounds professional.

945
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,686
Uh, actually, IBM stands for International Business Machines.

946
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,086
What did you say?

947
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,648
IBM stands for International Business Machines.

948
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,611
Get the fuck out of here.

949
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,683
I'm serious. You're not going to work here.

950
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,411
Get the fuck out of my office, you fucking nerd!

951
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,001
Go!

952
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,610
And for the record, AEY doesn't stand for anything.

953
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,448
Fuck! What a dick.

954
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,606
Does anybody else have any questions?

955
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,529
Sleep. I got her.

956
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,166
All right. All right.

957
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,521
Hi.

958
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,404
I know.

959
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,561
I know. It's okay.

960
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,201
Okay.

961
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,366
What?

962
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,605
360,000 SVD sniper rifles.

963
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,287
1,084,000 GP-30 grenades.

964
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,002
45,000 SKO aviation rockets.

965
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,726
The Pentagon's arming the Afghans for the next 30 years.

966
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,843
They're building a whole army.

967
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,289
Wait, that's got to be a typo.

968
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,806
It's not.

969
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,284
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo?

970
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,642
Bro, these aren't crumbs.

971
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,127
This is the whole fucking pie.

972
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,210
Among defense contractors,

973
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,051
this would come to be known as the Afghan deal.

974
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,083
It would be the biggest opportunity

975
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,044
AEY would ever see.

976
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,249
We had to go for it.

977
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,090
So, where do you go to arm an entire country?

978
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,891
Vegas X is where military and manufacturers

979
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,124
come together to unveil the latest in warfare.

980
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,842
It's like Comic-Con with grenades.

981
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,640
Sure, most of these guys didn't know who AEY was.

982
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,801
But we saw that as an advantage.

983
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,690
- You got your list?  - Got it.

984
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,842
- You feel good?  - Yeah, I feel pretty good.

985
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,162
You know, this is different than doing business on the phone.

986
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,044
When they look at us, they're going to see two kids.

987
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,366
So we have to show them our balls.

988
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,521
Got it.

989
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,489
We need to be fucking thugs, you understand?

990
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,721
Understood.

991
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,962
All right, good. Let's kill this shit.

992
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,328
But it was a complete disaster.

993
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,006
We quickly learned that

994
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,043
even if we could land the Afghan deal,

995
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,567
it would be a logistical nightmare.

996
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,240
Jerry, good to see you.

997
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,364
To source a deal of this magnitude

998
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,846
would mean piecing together

999
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,884
multiple vendors from all around the world.

1000
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,445
Whoa, whoa.

1001
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,721
Get out of here.

1002
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,684
It would require dozens of shipping outfits

1003
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,245
and hundreds of permits.

1004
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,930
We need 100 million rounds.

1005
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,727
All that could be okay for a major defense contractor.

1006
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,251
But not for us.

1007
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,967
Honestly, we were out of our league.

1008
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,642
Change $10,000.

1009
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,605
Any luck today?

1010
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,766
Efraim!

1011
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,801
What's up, bro?

1012
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,325
Where you been? Why aren't you answering your phone?

1013
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,766
I'm with a prostitute. What's up?

1014
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,122
Okay, you need to get dressed and come with me right now.

1015
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,283
All right, uh, give me

1016
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,607
38 minutes.

1017
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,122
Efraim, Henry Girard is down at the bar, waiting for us.

1018
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,841
Get the fuck out of here.

1019
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,361
I'm dead serious.

1020
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,807
Shit.

1021
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,201
Okay.

1022
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,010
Henry Girard was a legend among arms dealers.

1023
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,683
When they hung Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity

1024
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,366
it was said that Henry sold them the rope.

1025
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,641
Hey, Henry, sorry I'm late.

1026
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,171
This is my partner I was telling you about.

1027
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,328
- Efraim Diveroli.  - Nice to meet you.

1028
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,164
It's an absolute pleasure.

1029
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,686
Henry has a dinner in 10 minutes,

1030
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,365
but I wanted you to hear this firsthand.

1031
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,968
I showed him the list and he can help.

1032
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,409
Great. With which part?

1033
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,681
All of it.

1034
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,571
He can fill the whole order.

1035
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,004
- The whole order?  - Mmm-hmm.

1036
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,645
Even the AK ammo?

1037
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,530
Not a problem.

1038
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,566
You do know it's 100 million rounds, right?

1039
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,689
Henry has contacts in Albania.

1040
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,367
Albania?

1041
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,360
They spent decades preparing for a Western invasion that never came.

1042
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,369
That country is one giant arsenal.

1043
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,528
It's all just sitting there.

1044
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,001
Tell him the best part.

1045
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,202
They're in the process of joining NATO,

1046
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,609
so they have to dispose of all of their Soviet era weapons.

1047
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,049
They are literally dismantling it and turning it into scrap.

1048
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,568
I can get most of the shit for pennies on the dollar.

1049
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,570
Now, tell him the other best part.

1050
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,043
You're looking at the exclusive agent for the whole fucking thing.

1051
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,130
This was the magic bullet.

1052
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,247
One supplier who could fill the entire Afghan deal.

1053
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,727
This wouldn't just put us in contention.

1054
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,087
We might actually win this thing.

1055
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,041
Sorry, I have a question.

1056
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,401
Sure.

1057
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,204
With that kind of hookup

1058
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,289
why don't you just bid on the contract yourself?

1059
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,921
Full disclosure?

1060
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,762
I'm barred from doing any business with the U.S. government.

1061
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,086
I'm on a watch list.

1062
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,486
Like a terrorist watch list?

1063
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,807
Mmm-hmm.

1064
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,402
- Got it.  - Wait, what?

1065
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,090
Okay, how much for the AK ammo?

1066
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,482
- 10 cents a round.  - That's fucking amazing.

1067
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,721
And what about shipping?

1068
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,450
You can get Ilyushin 76 through Russian pilots.

1069
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,681
80K per flight.

1070
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,769
I'm sorry, you're on a terrorist watch list?

1071
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,081
What the fuck!

1072
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,282
Do you work for Homeland Security? Relax, bro.

1073
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,404
You two should probably talk this over.

1074
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,126
We will. But we are very interested.

1075
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,601
Good. My flight leaves tomorrow morning at 10:00.

1076
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,802
I can't spend more than 48 hours in this dump.

1077
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,920
That's what I always say. Vegas is a two-day town.

1078
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,290
I was talking about America.

1079
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,963
We're talking exclusive access to a stockpile

1080
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,527
of Soviet Bloc non-standard weapons and ammo.

1081
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,364
That's going to win this deal for us.

1082
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,965
He's on a terrorist watch list!

1083
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,448
Whatever. People end up on that list for bringing scissors onto an airplane!

1084
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,206
That's not why he's on the list.

1085
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,523
Look, the Pentagon wants 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo

1086
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,161
in the middle of a worldwide shortage.

1087
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,527
Where do you think they think that's going to come from?

1088
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,885
A bunch of shady motherfuckers like that guy.

1089
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,488
This is the job.

1090
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,489
To do business with the people in places

1091
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,690
the U.S. government can't do business with directly.

1092
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,010
It's as simple as that.

1093
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,646
Fuck!

1094
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,321
Hey, boys.

1095
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,171
So we discussed it, and we'd like to move forward.

1096
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,404
Fantastic. Congratulations.

1097
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,722
- But we have to see the merchandise.  - Oh, of course.

1098
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,530
On site, in person.

1099
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,164
You guys ever been to Albania?

1100
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,891
Honestly, until last night

1101
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,764
I didn't even know it was a real fucking country.

1102
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,570
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

1103
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,724
Come on in. I'll call my guy and we'll set it up.

1104
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,608
Albania is a lot of things.

1105
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,002
But a beautiful place is not one of them.

1106
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,565
It took us three separate flights

1107
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,081
and 22 hours just to get there.

1108
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,571
Henry's people sent a driver

1109
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,250
to pick us up at the airport

1110
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,091
and the guy would not stop talking.

1111
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,044
I fall over, she revive me.

1112
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,530
But none of that diminished Efraim's enthusiasm.

1113
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,922
He really believed this could be the answer.

1114
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,605
Welcome, AEY.

1115
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,441
I am Yili Pinari,

1116
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,961
head of Albania's largest military export company.

1117
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,447
Efraim Diveroli. Good to see you.

1118
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,131
This is my business associate, David Packouz.

1119
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,964
- Glad to meet you.  - How you doing?

1120
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,647
Uh...

1121
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,286
Thank you for the sign.

1122
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,284
Oh. It's for you.

1123
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,330
Yes, I know. I said thank you for the sign.

1124
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,771
So, show us what you got.

1125
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,485
What is this place?

1126
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,642
Storage for the Albanian army.

1127
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,129
We have 700 more like it across the country.

1128
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,322
You have 700 warehouses like this?

1129
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,885
Not just warehouse.

1130
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,010
We use church, hospital, school.

1131
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,322
Albania is most armed country in the world.

1132
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,284
Hey, that's cool. Congrats, bro.

1133
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,369
It was like a fucking museum in there.

1134
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,165
Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight

1135
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,964
since the Cold War.

1136
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,810
But that didn't matter to us.

1137
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,207
All we cared about was the AK ammo.

1138
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,405
It's okay. We have plenty of what you came for.

1139
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,526
All these containers are filled with your bullets.

1140
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,009
What do you mean, all the bullets are right here?

1141
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,491
126 million rounds.

1142
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,647
Fuck me.

1143
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,526
Yeah. Fuck us all.

1144
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,401
How old are these?

1145
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,724
30, maybe 40 years. AK-47 bullets

1146
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,042
can last forever if properly stored.

1147
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,050
Right. Well, how were these stored?

1148
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,611
Uh, who gives a fuck how these were stored?

1149
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,080
All that matters is they fucking work.

1150
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,566
Do they work?

1151
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,206
You try.

1152
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,603
They fucking worked.

1153
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,363
The entire defense industry was scrambling over this deal.

1154
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,604
And the key to it was sitting in 23 shipping containers

1155
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,124
in the back of a rusted out warehouse on the other side of the world.

1156
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,770
We got back with just enough time

1157
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,606
to submit our bid before the government's deadline.

1158
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,400
And then we waited.

1159
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,442
We waited five months.

1160
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,166
Pa.

1161
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,131
David!

1162
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,287
- Is that Efraim?  - What?

1163
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,487
- Is it?  - David!

1164
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,080
We fucking won!

1165
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,766
Holy shit. We won the Afghan deal.

1166
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,485
- What?  - We won the Afghan deal!

1167
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,926
- We won?  - We fucking won!

1168
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,764
Bro! Are you fucking kidding me?

1169
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,962
- We fucking won!  - Yeah, motherfucker!

1170
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,281
Yeah! Yeah, motherfucker!

1171
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,486
Before we could begin,

1172
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,883
AEY still needed to be vetted by the government.

1173
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,485
It's a pain-in-the ass process

1174
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,165
involving three separate audits

1175
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,971
and an in-person interview.

1176
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,687
The audits were the biggest hurdle.

1177
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,531
I mean, we didn't even have a real bookkeeper.

1178
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,722
We didn't have real books.

1179
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,368
We had to fabricate AEY's accounting

1180
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,409
going back three years.

1181
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,565
Ledgers, bank statements, phony purchase orders,

1182
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,643
we forged it all.

1183
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,084
Two weeks later, we were in Rock Island,

1184
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,651
Illinois for our big meeting

1185
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,730
with procurement officers from the U.S. Military.

1186
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,244
We were pretty fucking nervous.

1187
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,087
So Efraim thought it'd be a good idea to get high in the parking lot.

1188
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,891
Hold up.

1189
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,771
Does it sound like we're more than two people right now?

1190
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,401
Yeah.

1191
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,246
It was really strong shit.

1192
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,526
Okay.

1193
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,245
This is very impressive.

1194
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,922
Very impressive.

1195
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,881
Frankly, we were a tad concerned with your performance history

1196
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,809
against a deal of this size.

1197
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,769
But after meeting you two face to face,

1198
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,930
we feel like we're in good hands on this one.

1199
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,487
Well, we won't let you down,

1200
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,441
sirs.

1201
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,761
Not to mention,

1202
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,810
your bid was far too attractive for us to pass up.

1203
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,440
Thank you. I mean, that's great to hear because we really worked hard on this.

1204
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,449
Sorry. Excuse me.

1205
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,168
One of you just said

1206
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,728
our bid was too attractive to pass up.

1207
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,769
What did you mean by that, exactly?

1208
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,964
He means you boys lowballed the shit out of your competition.

1209
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,610
Yeah. Uh...

1210
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,441
By how much?

1211
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,961
Millions.

1212
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,245
Okay.

1213
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,285
Just for me. I...

1214
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,170
I'm curious, how many millions?

1215
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,967
Well, technically, we're not supposed to discuss that with you,

1216
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,844
but what the hell.

1217
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,130
You guys came in $53 million lower than the nearest competition.

1218
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,760
Fuck! Fuck!

1219
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,841
Motherfucker!

1220
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,884
$53 million.

1221
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,850
We're okay.

1222
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,040
Look at the bright side.

1223
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,850
For once, the American taxpayer

1224
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,162
is getting a good deal on a defense contract.

1225
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,966
Man, fuck the American taxpayer.

1226
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,566
Hello?

1227
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,201
Iz?

1228
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,689
Hey, Ella. Hi.

1229
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,011
How are you, sweetie?

1230
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,564
Hey. Do you know where her blue sandals are?

1231
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,366
Oh, hey.

1232
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,529
Um, I'm not sure.

1233
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,210
But listen, can we talk for a sec?

1234
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,851
Mmm-hmm.

1235
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,727
I need to go back to Albania for a couple weeks.

1236
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,685
A month, tops.

1237
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,400
Sure. No problem.

1238
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,442
Hey, what's going on?

1239
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,090
Ella and I are going to stay with my mom for a while.

1240
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,765
What? What are you talking about?

1241
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,801
Iz, what happened?

1242
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,122
How come you didn't tell me you went to Iraq?

1243
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,771
I was looking for the plumber's number

1244
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,247
on your computer and I saw the photos.

1245
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,807
I can explain.

1246
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,929
You said you never left the hotel room in Jordan.

1247
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,766
I know. Because I didn't want to freak you out.

1248
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,168
Why is it every time I catch you in a lie

1249
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,768
you try to convince me that you lied for my benefit?

1250
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,325
At what point do you just admit you're a liar?

1251
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,603
Iz, would you stop, please?

1252
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,565
We said we'd tell each other everything.

1253
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,324
- You promised!  - I know! Okay, I fucked up.

1254
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,483
What else aren't you telling me?

1255
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,761
- Nothing.  - No.

1256
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,291
Seriously.

1257
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,241
You know everything now.

1258
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,684
Okay. Aren't you going to ask me why I called the plumber?

1259
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,122
Yeah, sure. What happened?

1260
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,764
The pipe is leaking in the guest bathroom.

1261
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,005
I found this.

1262
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,041
Let me guess. You didn't want to freak me out?

1263
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,327
Okay, hold on.

1264
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,170
So I hid some money under the sink.

1265
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,441
What's the big deal?

1266
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,642
The big deal is you hid it from me!

1267
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,881
No, I didn't!

1268
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,650
Then who did you hide it from?

1269
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,528
I don't know. It was stupid. You're right.

1270
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,004
We're going to leave before you think of something else to say.

1271
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,884
Iz, I'm sorry.

1272
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,851
Iz!

1273
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,480
Oh, fuck.

1274
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,005
Hey, what's up, man?

1275
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,281
What's up?

1276
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,527
Just getting ready to leave.

1277
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,041
What is that?

1278
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,730
I just wanted to thank you for agreeing to go on this trip.

1279
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,400
It's not lost on me,

1280
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,887
the sacrifice you're making for this company.

1281
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,525
And I really appreciate it.

1282
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,404
"To my partner, David. The world is yours."

1283
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,685
- It's from Scarface.  - Of course, man. I remember.

1284
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,686
Thank you.

1285
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,361
Yeah.

1286
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,760
Uh, hey, before I go,

1287
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,605
I just wanted...

1288
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,321
What's this?

1289
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,928
It's our partnership agreement. 70-30.

1290
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,327
I just wanted to make it official.

1291
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,280
Yeah, of course.

1292
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,286
- It's a good idea.  - Cool.

1293
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,207
Man, eight fucking weeks in Albania.

1294
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,841
Iz is going to hate me forever.

1295
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,961
No, she's going to suck your cock every day for a year.

1296
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,126
Because we're on the verge of making $30 million.

1297
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,406
Yeah, man.

1298
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,243
Go crush it.

1299
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,126
Thanks, bro.

1300
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,286
Nice.

1301
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,080
Hey, you've reached Iz. You know what to do.

1302
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,921
Come on, Iz. Don't cut me off like this.

1303
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,367
I'm in Albania, at the hotel.

1304
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,609
Left the number with your mom.

1305
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,531
And if you could please just call me back

1306
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,927
because I really miss you. Okay?

1307
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,487
And I love you.

1308
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,921
Bye.

1309
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,131
Good morning, buddy.

1310
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,845
Hey, Bashkim.

1311
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,684
Oh, I bring you Kolonat. It's our McDonald's.

1312
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,402
Yeah, I'm good. But thanks.

1313
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,290
We go to work now?

1314
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,082
Uh-huh. No, no, no. I said I need two trucks.

1315
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,487
Yeah, you just got the one here right now.

1316
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,883
Yeah. Look, I got a cargo plane sitting at the airport.

1317
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,929
Yeah, I know. I know.

1318
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,801
Hey, let me call you right back.

1319
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,331
Hey, stop! Stop, stop!

1320
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,289
Hold up, hold up, hold up! Hey, turn that off!

1321
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,760
What the fuck is that?

1322
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,288
Where did you get this?

1323
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,921
Yo! What's up?

1324
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,730
Hey, man, we got a problem.

1325
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,561
- Where you at?  - I'm at Liv, bro.

1326
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,366
Trying to bang some Cuban chick who's waiting for me at my table.

1327
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,561
Why, what do we got?

1328
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,481
Let me get this straight. I'm in Albania right now freezing my ass off.

1329
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,966
You're at Liv, trying to get laid?

1330
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,611
David, it's 1:00 a.m. here.

1331
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,285
I'm blowing off some steam.

1332
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,244
Yeah, 1:00 a.m. is when you're supposed to be at the office

1333
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,131
because that's the middle of fucking day in every country we do business with.

1334
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,561
Look, we got a problem with the AK ammunition.

1335
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,481
- What kind of problem?  - It's Chinese.

1336
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,445
Chinese, bro? What does that even mean, Chinese?

1337
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,165
It means it's from China.

1338
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,722
What are you talking about? I was there, I saw the ammo.

1339
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,921
We both did.

1340
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,281
Yeah, look, I don't know what to tell you.

1341
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,680
They fucked us. Okay? We got played.

1342
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,611
Hold on. How do you even know it's Chinese?

1343
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,610
There's Chinese writing on every fucking crate.

1344
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,609
Trust me, it's Chinese.

1345
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,881
Yeah.

1346
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,121
Henry, what the fuck!

1347
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,930
We've been trying to reach you for two days!

1348
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,201
It's Efraim and David.

1349
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,851
We have a serious fucking problem.

1350
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,281
I'm listening.

1351
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,648
The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.

1352
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,729
What, you think the Afghans who are getting

1353
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,003
shot up by the Taliban give a shit where their ammo comes from?

1354
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,645
No, but the Pentagon does.

1355
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,365
Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!

1356
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,289
America has an embargo against China.

1357
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,246
You had your boys show us the one crate of Albanian ammo in the entire country.

1358
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,886
I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you from inspecting the other crates?

1359
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,488
Did you even bother to ask what the country of origin was?

1360
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,011
Who the fuck would ask that?

1361
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,086
Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds

1362
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,045
of illegal Chinese ammunition that you sold us.

1363
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,480
What are we supposed to do?

1364
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,484
Do your fucking job!

1365
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,761
The U.S. government wants to look the other way.

1366
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,007
Don't give them a reason not to.

1367
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,771
And while you're at it, learn the difference between

1368
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,725
"We have a problem" and "You have a problem."

1369
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,881
Fuck!

1370
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,607
We were fucked. The ammo was worthless

1371
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,889
and I was stuck in Albania trying to piece together new suppliers

1372
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,481
from all over Eastern Europe.

1373
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,881
Holy shit.

1374
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,565
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

1375
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,841
I have a big idea.

1376
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,006
How did you get in my room?

1377
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,486
They let me in.

1378
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,645
I'm a trustworthy guy.

1379
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,531
Not only did they let me in, they brought me room service.

1380
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,606
Anyway, I have a big fucking idea.

1381
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,326
Yeah? What's that?

1382
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,800
What if we repack?

1383
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,321
Repack what?

1384
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,521
The bullets!

1385
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,610
What if we repack them all?

1386
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,171
100 million rounds?

1387
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,131
David, it can be done.

1388
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,881
Think about it. We'll also save a fortune on shipping.

1389
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,162
We trade out all the big, heavy wooden crates

1390
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,925
for light cardboard boxes.

1391
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,202
Yeah, but it would still be Chinese ammo.

1392
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,643
Look at this towel. Okay?

1393
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,767
Turkish. Made in Turkey.

1394
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,484
Not anymore. Now it's an Albanian towel.

1395
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,041
It's only Chinese if the packaging says it's Chinese.

1396
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,927
Yeah. But I mean, that's also fucking illegal, man.

1397
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,569
We have two options.

1398
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,041
We either repack this shit and send it off

1399
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,971
or we can walk away from a $300 million-deal.

1400
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,130
What do you want to do?

1401
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,169
When you put it like that there's really only one option.

1402
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,481
Our driver Bashkim introduced us to his friend

1403
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,047
who owned a boxing and storage company out of Tirana.

1404
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,046
This is Enver. I grew up with him.

1405
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,281
Nice to meet you, Enver.

1406
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,201
You too. Bashkim told me a little about your situation.

1407
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,051
Yeah, look, to put it simply, we have a weight problem.

1408
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,208
We're shipping a large quantity of ammunition

1409
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,129
from Albania to Afghanistan.

1410
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,765
Right now, it's packed in heavy tins

1411
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,166
inside big wooden crates.

1412
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,566
And what we would like to do

1413
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,564
is to transfer those bullets into plastic bags

1414
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,211
and then put those in double-walled,

1415
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,765
corrugated fiberboard boxes.

1416
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,921
Do you know what those are?

1417
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,527
Yeah, of course. For what reason?

1418
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,961
We just told you.

1419
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,531
What the fuck is it with this country?

1420
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,646
The original packaging, it's too heavy.

1421
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,691
Too many crates. We need to streamline.

1422
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,249
Okay. How many crates?

1423
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,410
A lot. It's 100 million rounds of ammunition.

1424
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,083
Understood. But how many actual crates?

1425
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,327
We have 68,520 crates.

1426
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,286
I've seen it.

1427
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,164
It's fucking crazy.

1428
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,961
Done.

1429
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,001
So 50 men, eight weeks.

1430
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,445
I can do it for $100,000.

1431
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,609
100,000 U.S. dollars?

1432
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,961
Yeah.

1433
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,324
- Give us a second.  - Yeah. One second, please.

1434
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,370
Okay. I'm going to talk very seriously.

1435
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,046
It was hard not to laugh.

1436
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,204
I mean, not only was this guy saving the entire deal,

1437
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,925
but by repacking all the ammo

1438
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,528
we would increase our profit margin by almost $3 million.

1439
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,251
Where should we get dinner tonight?

1440
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,722
There's this place by the hotel. It's pretty good.

1441
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,122
Okay. All right, go ahead.

1442
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,601
Okay, deal.

1443
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,123
It was even better than we thought.

1444
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,688
We were trading heavy wooden crates for light cardboard boxes.

1445
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,645
Eight ounce tins for plastic bags.

1446
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,085
By repacking the ammo,

1447
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,886
we would lighten our overall load by 180 tons.

1448
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,287
180 fucking tons!

1449
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:03,166
That meant fewer flights using lighter planes burning less fuel.

1450
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,883
Which all added up to more money for us.

1451
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,927
On December 8th, 2007,

1452
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,361
AEY delivered the first 5 million rounds

1453
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,562
to the Afghan army.

1454
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,409
It went off without a hitch.

1455
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,362
Come on, just say it once, sweetie. Come on.

1456
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,604
Say "dada." Say "dada."

1457
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,880
We really have to go, David.

1458
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,447
No, hey, five more minutes, please? Please?

1459
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,002
We're about to eat. My mom's waiting.

1460
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,289
Ella, wave goodbye to Daddy. Hmm.

1461
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,766
Bye-bye, Ella.

1462
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,169
Merry Christmas. I love you.

1463
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,326
Hey, can you give her to your mom so that we can talk for a minute?

1464
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,601
I'm sorry, David.

1465
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,081
We'll call you in a couple days. Okay?

1466
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,121
Bye.

1467
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,401
Hey, this is David.

1468
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,285
Bro, you want to hear something totally fucked up?

1469
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,209
Merry Christmas, Efraim.

1470
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,481
It's Christmas?

1471
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,727
That's why nobody's here.

1472
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,241
I was about to fire the entire office.

1473
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,124
Anyway, when I was over there,

1474
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,322
I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.

1475
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,601
Did you know his uncle

1476
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,127
works at the Albanian defense ministry?

1477
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,321
No, I didn't know that.

1478
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,561
Well, he does.

1479
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,531
So I said, "You know what would be interesting to me, Bashkim?

1480
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,084
"I'd be curious to know what Henry is paying the Albanians for the AK ammo."

1481
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,281
Efraim?

1482
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,045
Do you know what he found out?

1483
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,722
That motherfucker is paying two and a half cents a round.

1484
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,002
He's charging us a 400% markup!

1485
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,009
Yeah. So what? We do the same thing.

1486
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,526
Yeah, but this is our contract.

1487
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,371
And we almost lost it because of him and his Chinese fucking bullets.

1488
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,561
But we didn't lose it.

1489
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,841
That's not the point!

1490
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,447
I want to figure out a way to cut this cocksucker out of the deal.

1491
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,880
Efraim, stop.

1492
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,167
No, listen to me.

1493
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,044
I'm serious, man.

1494
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,480
We're making money, okay?

1495
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,524
He's making money, the whole thing is fucking working.

1496
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,085
Don't mess with it.

1497
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,726
I don't give a fuck. He's ripping us off!

1498
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,921
Look, I'm serious, okay?

1499
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,805
I'm going to be on the next flight out of here if you pull that shit.

1500
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,807
Whoa. Bro, you don't have to threaten me.

1501
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,445
All right? I'm your partner.

1502
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,563
Yeah, it doesn't always feel like that.

1503
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,403
I found this deal. And I'm over here

1504
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,171
doing all the work and you're in Miami trying to sabotage it.

1505
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,289
How am I sabotaging it?

1506
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,723
By trying to fuck over Henry, the way you fuck over everybody else.

1507
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,647
You're right. Henry's our partner.

1508
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,603
He's the reason we got this deal.

1509
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,847
I was just looking out for us and I took it too far.

1510
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,562
Don't sweat it, bro. I'll leave it alone.

1511
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,926
Thank you.

1512
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,881
We can't push our luck with this shit, man.

1513
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,805
All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1514
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,241
Whoa. What the fuck? Hey.

1515
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,561
Fuck! Stop.

1516
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,204
Stop! I don't understand!

1517
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,962
Do you understand now?

1518
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,001
Yeah. Yes.

1519
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,763
Did you really think you could cut me out of my own deal?

1520
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,681
Please.

1521
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,881
Fuck.

1522
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,521
Fuck.

1523
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,281
David, we need to talk.

1524
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,806
Now's not a good time.

1525
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,283
I have not been paid yet.

1526
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,010
What do you mean? Like for the month?

1527
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,406
Ever.

1528
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,489
You haven't been paid anything?

1529
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,081
Your partner doesn't return phone calls.

1530
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,163
My guys need to be paid.

1531
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,601
They are going to stop work.

1532
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,564
David, I know the real reason

1533
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,444
that you want ammunition repacked.

1534
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,565
Okay, look, Enver. Listen to me.

1535
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,047
I gotta fly to Miami right now. I'll be back in a week.

1536
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,361
But I promise you, the first thing that I'm going do when I land

1537
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,728
is make sure you get your money wired, okay?

1538
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,441
Okay.

1539
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,641
David.

1540
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,201
Airport, let's go.

1541
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,961
David.

1542
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,727
Look, I'm late for a flight. I'll be back next week.

1543
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,968
She said her husband didn't come home last night.

1544
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,769
Okay, what do you want me to do?

1545
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,008
She's very worried. It is not like him.

1546
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,370
Tell her I don't know her husband.

1547
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,561
Who's your husband?

1548
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,683
Bashkim.

1549
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,041
No one ever heard from Bashkim again.

1550
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,642
They never found a note, they never found a body.

1551
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,364
He just fell off the planet.

1552
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,884
I was done with Albania.

1553
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,123
I was never going back.

1554
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,361
Hi.

1555
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,841
Hey.

1556
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,207
The reason I went to Albania was to repackage Chinese ammunition

1557
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,210
so we could disguise it and sell it to the U.S. government.

1558
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,168
That sounds illegal.

1559
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,928
It is. But I'm done.

1560
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,491
I swear, no matter what happens for the rest of my life

1561
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,409
I'm never going to lie to you again.

1562
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,686
Mmm-hmm.

1563
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,564
I love you so much, Iz.

1564
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,840
What happened to your nose?

1565
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,048
I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters.

1566
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,571
- I think it's broken.  - Oh, my God.

1567
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,440
I think I'm going to go back to being a massage therapist.

1568
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,040
Is that okay?

1569
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,605
Yes.

1570
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,844
It was always okay.

1571
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,370
Hey, you're back.

1572
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,961
Whoa!

1573
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,401
Bro, what are you doing back? What happened to your face?

1574
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,568
That's everything that's been delivered on the Afghan deal.

1575
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,881
I want my cut. I'm out.

1576
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,766
What are you talking about?

1577
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,362
He put a fucking gun to my head, man.

1578
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,881
Who, Henry?

1579
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,690
You said that you were going to leave it alone.

1580
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,250
Oh, fuck.

1581
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,688
I fucked up.

1582
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,087
I'm done, Efraim.

1583
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,282
Look, you don't have to go back.

1584
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,885
I hired this new guy, Ivan.

1585
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,929
- He speaks Albanian.  - I'm done.

1586
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,481
What, do you think I just got 4 million bucks laying around?

1587
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,040
I've thought it through.

1588
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,208
I'll take 40 cents on the dollar.

1589
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,243
Yeah, I thought it through too.

1590
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,761
How about this?

1591
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,889
How about zero cents on the dollar?

1592
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,165
Let me remind you that we have a contract.

1593
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,686
Fuck your contract!

1594
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,445
If I asked you to build me a house,

1595
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,640
and you quit after building me half a house, you think I owe you half the money?

1596
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,922
Is this a fucking joke, David?

1597
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,600
You have two weeks. Otherwise, you'll hear from my lawyer.

1598
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,850
Who, Warren?

1599
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,442
Are you talking about Warren? He's my lawyer too.

1600
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,841
I introduced you to him.

1601
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,925
Fucking Warren.

1602
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,601
Fuck!

1603
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,124
AEY. How may I direct your call?

1604
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,730
We fight.

1605
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,845
Fight with our families,

1606
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,809
fight with our business associates.

1607
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,128
Sometimes we fight with our friends.

1608
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,401
If God were here,

1609
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,965
we'd probably fight with Him too.

1610
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,288
Efraim has a heavy heart over what's happened.

1611
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,447
No offense, Ralph, but I'm not sure you've ever met the real Efraim.

1612
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,801
He's a complicated young man.

1613
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,763
But he just wants to sit down and talk.

1614
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,805
Find a fair solution.

1615
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,249
He's asked me to mediate.

1616
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,164
Let me help you, David.

1617
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,401
I just don't know if I'm ready yet.

1618
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,647
All right, here he is.

1619
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,006
Hey, bro.

1620
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,922
Good to see you.

1621
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,528
Sorry things have gotten so crazy.

1622
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,730
Yeah. Me too.

1623
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,570
You having anything, hon?

1624
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,808
I'll just have a coffee. Thanks.

1625
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,964
I've thought about it a lot.

1626
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,600
And I don't want you to walk away from this empty-handed.

1627
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,801
Cool.

1628
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,611
So I had Warren draft up a severance agreement.

1629
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,285
And I think it's pretty fair.

1630
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,411
I'm prepared to pay you 50K per year for the next four years.

1631
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,046
200 grand?

1632
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,524
Is this a fucking joke, man?

1633
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,084
Is this what you meant by mediation?

1634
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,560
In all fairness, there was never

1635
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,728
a partnership agreement, no prior contract.

1636
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,971
Yeah. I have something better than a partnership agreement.

1637
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,964
I have proof.

1638
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,680
Before I left Albania, I took everything.

1639
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,881
What the fuck.

1640
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,811
All the documents we forged, photos of repacking.

1641
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,081
- David!  - Repacking?

1642
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,520
- He didn't tell you?  - David!

1643
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,131
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1644
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,164
and we bought 100 million rounds of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1645
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,211
then we repackaged it and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1646
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,085
Yeah, and we made $8 million doing it, asshole.

1647
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,281
Careful, Efraim.

1648
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,930
We told Ralph we only made $3 million on that one.

1649
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,121
Wait, what now?

1650
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,964
He sends you fake accounting reports every month.

1651
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,844
- Oh, fuck off.  - I make them on my laptop.

1652
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,326
Now you're just making shit up.

1653
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,722
Really? Because I kept everything, you dumb fuck!

1654
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,571
I even have copies of the bank statements that we photoshopped

1655
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,807
and sent to the government.

1656
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,082
Get the fuck out of here.

1657
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,124
I can bury you.

1658
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,046
Us.

1659
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,364
I think you meant to say,

1660
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,882
you can bury us.

1661
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,202
Because anything that implicates me,

1662
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,881
implicates you as well.

1663
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,206
- Efraim, wait.  - No, no, no.

1664
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,961
I came here today prepared to pay you $200,000.

1665
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,525
Now I'm not even going to pay for breakfast.

1666
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,844
Oh. What's going on over here? Huh?

1667
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,081
Hello?

1668
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,123
May I speak with David Packouz?

1669
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,322
- Yeah, who's this?  - Hi, David.

1670
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,603
This is C. J. Chivers with The New York Times.

1671
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,451
I was wondering if you had a minute to talk about AEY,

1672
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,962
and the alleged repackaging of Chinese ammunition.

1673
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,085
I don't know what you're talking about.

1674
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,408
Well, according to my source, there's an ongoing investigation

1675
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,601
at the State Department.

1676
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,444
And I was hoping to get some clarification...

1677
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,888
David, this sounds pretty serious.

1678
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,411
Yeah, I know.

1679
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,124
Maybe you should call my uncle.

1680
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,086
The lawyer.

1681
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,651
Oh, my God. Okay.

1682
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,444
That's a good idea.

1683
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,246
Hey, give me a minute. I'll meet you guys in the lobby.

1684
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,721
You just get a call from The New York Times?

1685
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,041
Yeah.

1686
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,881
Me too.

1687
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,881
You know, Scarface was on TV last night,

1688
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,330
and I was watching it and thinking about when we were little

1689
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,851
and we used to do the lines from the movie.

1690
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,362
You're my best friend, David.

1691
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,000
God, I really fucked this up, didn't I?

1692
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,924
I'm sorry, bro.

1693
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,481
Wow.

1694
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,048
Are you ever not acting, man?

1695
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,727
What does that mean?

1696
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,287
You just tell me what you think I want to hear,

1697
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,481
because The New York Times called,

1698
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,682
and you're freaking out that I might say something.

1699
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,486
Just admit it.

1700
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,208
We were never best friends.

1701
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,047
You were just playing the part of my best friend.

1702
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,965
Yeah.

1703
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,646
Scarface wasn't even on TV last night.

1704
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,765
You're such a piece of shit.

1705
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,603
- Fuck!  - Fuck you.

1706
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,688
- Fuck.  - Little bitch.

1707
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,324
Well, that saves us a trip.

1708
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,967
Out of all the illegal shit we did,

1709
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,007
all the lies we told the government,

1710
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,000
in the end, the thing that did us in?

1711
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,086
Yes, I'm trying to reach the Department of Defense, please.

1712
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,886
Efraim never paid the box guy.

1713
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,047
To who do you report a crime?

1714
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,724
After Enver called the Pentagon,

1715
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,446
the State Department launched a full-scale investigation,

1716
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,489
that went on for months.

1717
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:38,206
They busted Ralph at one of his shops in the middle of a work day.

1718
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,643
He was horrified and couldn't make a deal fast enough.

1719
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,084
All that bullshit about him wanting to mediate a truce between Efraim and I...

1720
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,406
It was a setup.

1721
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,204
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1722
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,125
and we bought 100 million rounds of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1723
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,563
then we repackaged it and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1724
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,490
They had us dead to rights.

1725
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,370
It was pathetic.

1726
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,811
While going through Efraim's computer, they even found a to-do list that said,

1727
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,082
"Repackage Chinese ammo. "

1728
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,486
The story tonight that has Pentagon officials scrambling.

1729
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,607
How did two 20-something young men land a big Pentagon contract?

1730
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,929
Federal agents arrested both men last week, charging them with fraud

1731
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:25,249
for selling outdated, defective Chinese ammunition

1732
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,845
to the Pentagon.

1733
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,967
Efraim was charged with over 70 federal crimes

1734
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,567
and sentenced to four years in prison.

1735
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,762
I pled guilty and was sentenced to seven months house arrest.

1736
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:47,403
Congress called the Afghanistan contract a case study

1737
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,002
in all that is wrong with the government's procurement process.

1738
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:05,809
In 2022, AEY will be eligible once again to bid on Federal contracts.

1739
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,800
How's it going?

1740
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,841
It's okay.

1741
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,364
If I wanted you dead, you'd already be dead.

1742
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,246
I guess it's going all right then.

1743
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,766
Come in.

1744
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,964
How's your baby?

1745
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,650
It's a girl, right?

1746
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,729
Yeah. She's good.

1747
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,891
I got three.

1748
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,246
All girls.

1749
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,570
They tell you it gets better.

1750
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,967
That's not true, it gets worse.

1751
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,250
That's why I like the arms business.

1752
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,647
No women.

1753
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,440
I want to apologize about Albania.

1754
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,641
I had bad information.

1755
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,890
So you stuffed me in the trunk of a car and shoved a gun in my face by mistake?

1756
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,127
Yeah.

1757
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,443
I'm not a bad man, but in certain situations,

1758
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,085
I have to ask myself,

1759
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,648
what would a bad man do?

1760
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,884
I appreciate you leaving my name out of your testimony.

1761
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,048
I didn't really see a reason to include it.

1762
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,765
Yeah, but still.

1763
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,531
Can I ask you a question?

1764
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,321
Sure.

1765
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,486
When we met in Vegas at the blackjack table,

1766
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,605
was that a coincidence?

1767
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,249
What do you think?

1768
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,484
Can I ask you another question?

1769
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,965
My driver in Albania went missing.

1770
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
Do you know what happened to him?

1771
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,764
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.

1772
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,931
It's for you.

1773
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,768
No more questions.
