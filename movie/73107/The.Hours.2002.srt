<i>Dearest, I feel certain

3
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,900
<i>that I am going mad again.

4
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,260
<i>I feel we can't go

5
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,300

of these terrible times,

6
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,460

7
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,740
<i>recover this time.

8
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,100
<i>I begin to hear voices,
and can't concentrate.

9
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,140
<i>So, I am doing
what seems to be

10
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,100
<i>the best thing to do.

11
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,060
<i>You have given me

12
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,860
<i>the greatest possible
happiness.

13
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,340
<i>You have been in every way

14
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,620
<i>all that anyone could be.

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,140
<i>I know
that I am spoiling your life,

16
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,780
<i>and without me,
you could work.

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,820
<i>And you will,

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,700
<i>I know.

19
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,940
<i>You see, I can't
even write this properly.

20
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,780
<i>What I want to say
is that I owe

21
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,420
<i>all the happiness
of my life to you.

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,340
<i>You have been entirely patient
with me...

23
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,700
<i>and

24
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,420

25

<i>Everything's gone

26

<i>of your goodness.

28
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,660
<i>I can't go on
spoiling your life any longer.

29
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,380

30

31

<i>Virginia.

32
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,580
Good morning, Doctor.

33
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,020
Mr. Woolf.

34
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,140
No worse, I think.

35
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,060
I see.

36
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,060
The main thing is to keep her
where she is, and calm.

37
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,340
Friday, then.

38
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,500
Good morning, Leonard.

39
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,780
Good morning, Virginia.

40
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,140
How was your sleep ?

41
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,740
Uneventful.

42
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,460
The headaches ?

43
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,220
No. No headaches.

44
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,620
Doctor seemed pleased.

45
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,220
That's all from this morning ?

46
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,620
Yes. This young man
has submitted his manuscript.

47
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,180
I've found three errors of fact

48
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,100
and two spelling mistakes,

49
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,580
and I'm not yet on page four.

50
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,580
Have you had breakfast ?

51
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
Yes.

52
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,820
Liar.

53
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,820
Virginia, it's not
my insistence.

54
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,140
It's your own doctor's.

55
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm going to send

56
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,100
Nelly up with some fruit
and a bun.

57
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,820
Right. Lunch, then.

58
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,820
Proper lunch,

59
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,460
husband and wife
sitting down together...

60
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,780
soup, pudding

61
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,540
and all.

62
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,820
By force if necessary.

63
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,940
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.

64
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,180
Work, then.

65
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,660
Then you must eat.

66
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,180
Mrs. Dalloway said...

67
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,420
she would buy the flowers...
herself.

68
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,660
<i>Mrs. Dalloway said

69
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,860

70
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Sally, I think I'll buy
the flowers myself.

71
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,660
What ?

72
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,740
What flowers ?

73
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,420
Oh, shit. I forgot.

74
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,140
You're never going
to be a big boy

75
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,260
if you don't eat
your breakfast.

76
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,660
You're going to be
the big brother.

77
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
It's a very important job.

78
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,900
Happy birthday.

79
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,580
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, Dan.

80
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,140
Roses on your own birthday.

81
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,500
You're too much.
Really.

82
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,980
He'll eat it

83
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,060
now that you're here.

84
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,300
It's your birthday.

85
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,900
You shouldn't be out
buying me flowers.

86
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,500
Well, you were still sleeping.

87
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,180
So ?

88
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,100
Well, we decided
it would be better

89
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,980
if we let you sleep in
a little, didn't we ?

90
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,220
Morning, bug.

91
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,020
You need to rest, Laura.

92
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,620
You're only four months away.

93
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,740
Dan, don't.

94
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,220
I'm fine.

95
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,140
I'm just tired.

96
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,380
I've been telling him
he's got to eat his breakfast.

97
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,580
That's true.

98
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,300
So, it's a beautiful day.

99
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,620
What are you two going
to be doing with it ?

100
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,180
We've got our plans,
don't we ?

101
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,380
What plans ?

102
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,700
Hmm...

103
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,300
Well, it wouldn't
be much of a party,

104
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,300
would it, if I told you

105
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,380
every detail in advance ?

106
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,580
Well, I better just stop

107
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,180
asking questions then, huh ?

108
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,380
That the time ?

109
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,700
I better get going.

110
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,660
Have a good day.

111
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,740
You, too.

112
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,780
Dan, happy birthday.

113
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,940
Oh, thank you.

114
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,300
You need to finish
your breakfast.

115
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,980
Oh, I'm going to make a cake.

116
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,100
That's what I'm going to do.

117
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm going to make the cake
for Daddy's birthday.

118
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,660
Mommy, can I help ?

119
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,020
Can I help make the cake ?

120
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,100
Of course you can, sweet pea.

121
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm not going to do
anything without you.

122
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,500
No, of course.

123
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,220
You have to come.

124
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,380
Of course.

125
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,460
Well, I always wanted you

126
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,420
and everybody involved
in the actual ceremony.

127
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,140
I don't know.

128
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,540
Around 60.

129
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,940
Well, it will.

130
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,780
It'll mean so much.

131
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,060
The whole occasion.

132
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,060
It's the least I can do

133
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,060
to have a nice dinner
and say thank you

134
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,180
to everybody.

135
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,780
You've done so much for him.

136
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,260
Oh, I take that as a yes.

137
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,820
He'll be thrilled.

138
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,100
Oh, my God.

139
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,180
I'm thrilled.
Oh, good.

140
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,580
What if nobody comes ?

141
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,260
This is Clarissa Vaughan.

142
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,540
Yes, I am just confirming

143
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,820
that you're sending a car
to pick me up first.

144
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,140
Yeah.

145
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,740
- Hi, Clarissa.
- Hi, can't talk.

146
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,340
And then we're
going over to 679 Hudson,

147
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,220
which is at 9th and 14th.

148
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,780
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us.

149
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,380
And it'll be over at seven.

150
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,020
Flowers !
What a beautiful morning.

151
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,940
Hi, Clarissa.
How are you ?

152
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,340
I'm having a party.

153
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,260
My friend Richard's won
the Carruthers.

154
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,660
Well, that's just terrific...

155
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,140
if I knew what it was.

156
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,740
It's a poetry prize
for a life's work.

157
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,540
It's the most prestigious.

158
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,980
For a poet,
it's the best you can do.

159
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,220
Oh, very good.

160
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
So, what would you like ?

161
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,820
The lilies are perfect.

162
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,860
No. Too morbid.

163
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,940
Hydrangeas, I think.

164
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,380
And, um...

165
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,340
Oh, oh, let's just have
buckets of roses.

166
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,700
And... I think I'm going
to take these with me.

167
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,500
Rodney ?

168
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,980
Okay.

169
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,980
Thank you.

170
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,340
I actually tried
to read Richard's novel.

171
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,220
You did ?

172
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,940
Oh, I know. It's not easy.

173
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,100
I know.

174
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,540
It did take him
ten years to write.

175
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,460
Maybe it just takes
another ten to read.

176
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,180
It's you, isn't it ?

177
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,580
What is ?

178
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,060
In the novel,
isn't it meant to be you ?

179
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,740
Oh, I see.

180
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,220
Yeah.

181
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,660
Sort of.

182
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,100
I mean, in a way.

183
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,380
You know, Richard's a writer.

184
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,660
That's what he is.

185
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,180
He uses things
which actually happen.

186
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,620
Yeah.

187
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,860
And years ago,
he and I were students.

188
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,980
That's true.

189
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,500
But, you know,
then he changes things.

190
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,340
Oh, sure.

191
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,460
I don't mean in a bad way.

192
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,020
It's more like...
he makes them his own.

193
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,620
A woman's whole life...

194
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,900
in a single day,

195
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,660
just one day...

196
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,500
and in that day,

197
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,460
her whole life.

198
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,180
This is what we need.

199
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,620
Shortening...

200
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,300
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

201
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,620
Yes, it's me !

202
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Oh... It's me.

203
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,340
Come in.

204
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,940
Richard,
it's a beautiful morning.

205
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,340
How about we let in
a little more light ?

206
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,100
Is it still morning ?

207
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,980
Yes, it is.

208
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,140
Have I died ?

209
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,180
Good morning, my dear.

210
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,060
Any visitors ?

211
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,060
Yes.

212
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,220
Are they still here ?

213
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,700
No. They've gone.

214
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,540
Mm. How'd they look ?

215
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,500
Today ?

216
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,540
Sort of like black fire.

217
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,900
I mean, sort of light

218
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,300
and dark at the same time.

219
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,500
There was one a bit
like an electrified jellyfish.

220
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,820
They were singing.

221
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,340
May have been Greek.

222
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,300
So the ceremony is at 5:00.

223
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,580
Do you remember ?

224
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,820
And then...

225
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,180
the party is right after.

226
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,700
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they ?

227
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,420
What a question. Of course.

228
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,460
Richard, you did eat it ?

229
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,820
Well, can you see it ?

230
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,980
Is it here ?

231
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,980
Any breakfast lying around ?

232
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,300
No, I don't see it.

233
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,060
Well, then I must have
eaten it, mustn't I ?

234
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,420
I suppose.

235
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Does it matter ?

236
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,380
Of course, it matters.

237
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,700
You know what the doctors say.

238
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,500
Have you been skipping pills ?

239
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,820
Clarissa, I can't take this.

240
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,780
Take what ?

241
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,060
Having to be proud and brave

242
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,500
in front of everybody.

243
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,580
Oh. Honey, it's not
a performance.

244
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,660
Of course it is.

245
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,860
I got the prize
for my performance.

246
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,860
Well, that is
nonsense.

247
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,980
I got the prize for having AIDS
and going nuts

248
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,180
and being brave about it.

249
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,500
I actually got the prize
for having come through.

250
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,260
It's not true.

251
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,820
- For surviving, that's what
- It's not true.

252
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,300
I got the prize for.
Oh, you think they

253
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,420
would have given it to me
if I were healthy ?

254
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

255
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,980
Is it here somewhere ?

256
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,940
What ?

257
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,380
The prize.
I'd like to look at it.

258
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,660
No, you haven't gotten it yet.

259
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,260
It's tonight.

260
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,820
Are you sure ?

261
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,980
Um...

262
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,180
I remember
the ceremony perfectly.

263
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,660
I seem to have
fallen out of time.

264
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,180
Richard.

265
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,860
Richard...

266
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,580
it's a party,

267
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,860
and it's only a party.

268
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,020
Hmm ? Populated entirely

269
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,700
by people who respect
and admire you.

270
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,220
A small party, is it ?

271
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,860
A select party, is it ?

272
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,340
Your friends.

273
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,180
I thought I lost all my friends.

274
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
I thought I drove
my friends crazy.

275
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,260
Jesus.

276
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,460
Oh, Mrs. Dalloway,

277
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,940
always giving parties
to cover the silence.

278
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,740
Richard...

279
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,260
You won't need to do anything.

280
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,220
All you have to do is appear,

281
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,260
sit on the sofa.

282
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,820
And I will be there.

283
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,220
This is a group of people

284
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,940
who want to tell you
your work is going to live.

285
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,140
Oh, is it ?

286
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,060
Is my work going to live ?

287
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,220
I can't go through with it,
Clarissa.

288
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,260
Oh... Why do you say that ?

289
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,860
- I can't.
- Why ?

290
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,500
Because I wanted
to be a writer, that's all.

291
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,460
So ?

292
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,300
I wanted to write about it all.

293
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,380
Everything that happens
in a moment.

294
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,420
The way the flowers looked

295
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,140
when you carried them
in your arms.

296
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,420
This towel, how it... smells,
how it feels.

297
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,540
This thread.

298
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,100
All our feelings,

299
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,860
yours and mine.

300
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,860
The history of it,

301
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,500
who we once were.

302
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,260
Everything in the world.

303
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,660
Everything all mixed up...

304
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,420
like it's all mixed up now.

305
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,940
And I failed.

306
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,820
I failed.

307
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,580
No matter what you start with,
it ends up being so much less.

308
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,860
Sheer fucking pride...

309
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,460
and stupidity.

310
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,100
We want everything, don't we ?

311
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,540
I suppose we do.

312
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,660
You kissed me on a beach.

313
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,380
Yeah.

314
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,180
Do you remember...

315
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,660
how many years ago ?

316
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,860
Of course.

317
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,140
What did you want then ?

318
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,140
Come closer.

319
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,620
I'm right here.

320
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,780
Come closer, would you, please ?

321
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,100
Take my hand.

322
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,580
Would you be angry ?

323
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,860
Would I be angry
if you didn't show up

324
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,140
at the party ?

325
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,380
Would you be angry if I died ?

326
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,620
If you died ?

327
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,940
Who is this party for ?

328
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,060
What do you mean, who's it for ?

329
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,900
What are you asking ?
What are you trying to say ?

330
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,620
I'm not trying to say anything.

331
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,740
Mm.

332
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,020
I'm saying...

333
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,020
I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.

334
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Well...

335
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,620
so that is what we do.

336
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,380
That is what people do.

337
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,060
They stay alive for each other.

338
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,060
And the doctors told you,

339
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,500
you-you don't need to die.

340
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,460
They told you that.

341
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,900
You can... live
like this for years.

342
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,700
Well, exactly.

343
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,580
I don't accept this.

344
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,420
I don't accept what you say.

345
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,420
Oh.

346
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,660
And it's for you
to decide, is it ?

347
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,100
How long have you been
doing that ?

348
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,300
How many years ?

349
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,580
Coming to the apartment.

350
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,500
What about your own life ?

351
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,100
What about Sally ?

352
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,340
Just wait till I die.

353
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,740
Then you'll have to think
of yourself.

354
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,940
How are you going to like that ?

355
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,460
Richard...

356
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,660
it would be great
if you did come to the party,

357
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,100
if you felt
well enough to come.

358
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,300
Just to let you know,

359
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,340
I am making the crab thing.

360
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,260
Not that I imagine
it makes any difference to you.

361
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,900
Of course,
it makes a difference.

362
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,140
I love the crab thing.

363
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,060
Clarissa ?

364
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,180
Yes ?

365
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,260
I'll be back at 3:30,

366
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,740
and I'll help you
get dressed.

367
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,940
Wonderful.

368
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
3:30.

369
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,540
Wonderful.

370
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,820
<i>It's on this day,

371
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,980
<i>this day of all days...

372
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,820
<i>her fate becomes clear
to her.

373
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,700
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.

374
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,020
Mr. Woolf said I was to come
and speak with you.

375
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,340
I've nearly finished, Nelly.

376
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,300
You can tell me in the kitchen.

377
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,820
I'll be down very soon.

378
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,660
Hmm.

379
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,980
What happens is,
she says she wants something,

380
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,460
and then it turns out
she doesn't.

381
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,140
Well, she never does, does she ?

382
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,140
She never wants anything.

383
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,140
Mm-hmm.

384
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,380
Especially when she's
particularly after it.

385
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,340
That's a sure sign.

386
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,540
I wish I'd been there.

387
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,900
I wish you had, too.

388
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,060
Did you give her that look ?

389
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
That sort of look you do ?

390
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,340
<i>I said, Madam...

391
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,700
Yes, Nelly, tell me.

392
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,860
How can I help ?

393
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,180
It's about lunch.

394
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,500
I just had
to go ahead on my own.

395
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,260
I understand.

396
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,860
You chose a pie ?

397
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,580
I chose a lamb pie.

398
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,780
That seems suitable.

399
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,180
You being so busy
with your writing...

400
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,500
I had no instructions.

401
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,980
You do remember
that my sister is coming

402
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,580
at 4:00 with the children ?

403
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,780
Yes, ma'am.

404
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,740
I hadn't forgotten.

405
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,260
China tea, I think.

406
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
And ginger.

407
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,060
Ginger, Madam ?

408
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,700
I'd like
to give the children a treat.

409
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,860
We'd have to go to London

410
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,820
for ginger, Madam.

411
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,140
I haven't finished this,

412
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,060
and there's the rest
of lunch

413
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,500
to get ready.

414
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,340
The 12:30 train, Nelly,
will get you

415
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,900
into London just after 1:00.

416
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
If you return on the 2:30,

417
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,940
you should be back in Richmond
soon after 3:00.

418
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,780
Do I miscalculate ?

419
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,940
No.

420
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,380
Well, then, is something
detaining you, Nelly ?

421
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,140
I can't think of anything
more exhilarating

422
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,300
than a trip to London.

423
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,940
- Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.
- Good morning.

424
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,860
We shall publish
no more new authors.

425
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
I have to tell you,

426
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,700
I've discovered ten errors
in the first proof.

427
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,300
Lucky to have found them then.

428
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,940
<i>Passiondale was a...

429
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,100
<i>charnel house

430
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,700
<i>from which no min returned.

431
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,140
Do you think it's possible that

432
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,820
bad writing actually
attracts a higher

433
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,700
incidence of error ?

434
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,420
If it's all right, I thought
I might take a short walk.

435
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,260
Not far ?

436
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,740
No. Just for air.

437
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,540
Go then.

438
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,620
If I could walk midmorning,

439
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,020
I'd be a happy man.

440
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,740
She'll die.

441
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,100
She's going to die.

442
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,020
That's what's going to happen.

443
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,540
Huh.

444
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,140
That's it.

445
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
She'll kill herself.

446
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,700
She'll kill herself
over something

447
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,540
which doesn't seem to matter.

448
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,060
Let's think.

449
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,820
You grease the pan, Mommy.

450
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
I know you grease the pan,
sweet one.

451
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,220
Even Mommy knows that.

452
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,820
This is what we're going to do.

453
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,980
Flour...

454
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,340
bowl...

455
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,500
sifter.

456
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Can I do it, Mommy ?

457
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,140
Can you sift the flour ?

458
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,220
Yes, you can sift the flour,
baby,

459
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,940
if that's what makes you happy.

460
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,900
Yeah.

461
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,700
Isn't it beautiful ?

462
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,940
Don't you think
it looks like snow ?

463
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,900
Hmm ?

464
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,860
Okay.

465
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,180
Now, the next thing...

466
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,820
The next thing I'm going

467
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,900
to show you... uh, is...

468
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,060
we measure out the cups.

469
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,500
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

470
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,260
Now, I know.
I know it isn't difficult.

471
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,260
It's just that I...

472
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,620
I just want to do this
for Daddy.

473
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,540
Because it's his birthday ?

474
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,500
That's right.

475
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,980
We're baking the cake

476
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,900
to show him
that we love him.

477
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,420
Otherwise he won't know
we love him ?

478
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,620
That's right.

479
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,980
I got all the stuff.

480
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,220
I'm going right out again.

481
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,900
My God, what a zoo !

482
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,580
Why do people have to talk
about dry cleaning ?

483
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,700
I mean, what is there
to talk about ?

484
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,340
I bought you some flowers.

485
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,740
Where are you ?

486
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,460
In here.

487
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,820
I got someone at work
to cover me.

488
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,980
I'll be with you all night.

489
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,340
Are you all right ?

490
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,220
Sure.

491
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,700
I guess you saw Richard.

492
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,020
That's right.

493
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,340
Well, of course.

494
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,260
I bet he said,

495
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,900
<i>Oh, by the way,
honey, do you mind ?

496
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,020
<i>Can I skip the party ?

497
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,220
Don't worry.

498
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,860
He always shows up.

499
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
Oh, sure.

500
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,060
In the end.

501
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,820
What, Richard miss an award ?

502
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,940
A chance to talk about his work.

503
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,340
I don't think so.

504
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,460
He'll show up.

505
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,180
You did the seating.

506
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,980
I did.

507
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,780
I don't believe it...
Louis Waters.

508
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,020
Is Louis coming ?

509
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,140
Richard's Louis ?

510
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,500
He is.

511
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,500
You put him next to me.

512
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,900
Why do I always have
to sit next to the exes ?

513
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,740
Is this some kind of a hint,
sweetheart ?

514
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,140
And, anyway, shouldn't
the exes have a table

515
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,500
of their own,
where they can all ex together

516
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,980
in ex-quisite agony ?

517
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,900
I'm off.

518
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,820
Try not to pass out
from excitement.

519
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,540
Clarissa...

520
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,820
it's going to be beautiful.

521
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,900
Thank you.

522
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,740
You're welcome.

523
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,260
Why is everything wrong ?

524
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,780
It didn't work.

525
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,820
Damn it !

526
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,780
It didn't work.

527
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,260
Hey, Scott.

528
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,300
Hi, Mrs. Barlowe.

529
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,460
Mommy, Mommy, there's
someone at the door !

530
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,060
Hello ?

531
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,900
Hello ? Laura ?

532
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Hi, Kitty.

533
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,100
Hi. Am I interrupting ?

534
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,700
Oh, of course not. Come in.

535
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,820
Are you all right ?

536
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,380
Why, sure.

537
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,500
Hi, Richie.

538
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,620
Sit down.

539
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,060
I've got coffee on.

540
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,820
Um, would you like some ?

541
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,940
Please.

542
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,220
Oh, look.

543
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,460
You made a cake.

544
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,740
I know.

545
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,860
Didn't work.

546
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,420
I thought it was going to work.

547
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,860
I thought
it would work better than that.

548
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Oh, Laura, I don't understand

549
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
why you find it so difficult.

550
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,060
I don't know either.

551
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,260
Anyone can make a cake.

552
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,220
I know.

553
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Everyone can.

554
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,940
It's ridiculously easy.

555
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,940
Like, I bet you didn't
even grease the pan.

556
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,580
I greased the pan.

557
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,620
All right.

558
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,740
You know, you have

559
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,020
other virtues... and
Dan loves you so much,

560
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
he won't even notice.

561
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Whatever you do,

562
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,700
he's going to say
it's wonderful.

563
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,980
Well, it's true.

564
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,460
Does Ray have a birthday ?

565
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Sure he does.

566
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,340
When is it ?

567
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,500
September.

568
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,940
We go to the country club.

569
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,740
We always go
to the country club.

570
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,540
We drink martinis and spend
the day with 50 people.

571
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,100
Ray's got a lot of friends.

572
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,460
He does.

573
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,020
You both have a lot of friends.

574
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,020
You're good at it.

575
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,180
How is Ray ?

576
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,140
I haven't seen him in a while.

577
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,260
Ray's fine.

578
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,420
Mmm.

579
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,500
These guys are
something, aren't they ?

580
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,780
You can say that again.

581
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,780
They came home from the war.

582
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,980
They deserved it, didn't they ?

583
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,220
After what they'd
been through.

584
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,940
What... did they deserve ?

585
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,140
I don't know.

586
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,140
Us, I guess.

587
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,020
All this.

588
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,660
Oh.

589
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,580
You're reading a book.

590
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,780
Yeah.

591
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,900
What's this one about ?

592
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,180
Oh, it's about...

593
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,860
this woman who's incredibly...

594
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,020
Well, she's a hostess, and
she's incredibly confident,

595
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,140
and she's going to give a party,

596
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,500
and maybe because
she's confident,

597
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,420
everyone thinks she's fine...

598
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,940
but she isn't.

599
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,260
So.

600
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,620
Well.

601
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,740
Kitty, what is it ?

602
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,540
Is something wrong ?

603
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,460
I, uh... I have
to go into the hospital

604
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,660
for a couple of days.

605
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,340
Kitty.

606
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,660
Yeah. I have, um...

607
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,860
some kind of... growth,
in my uterus,

608
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,460
and they're going to go in
and take a look.

609
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,420
When ?

610
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,700
This afternoon.

611
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,020
Well, I need you
to feed the dog.

612
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,060
Of course.

613
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,620
Is that what you
came here to ask ?

614
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,980
What did the doctor
say exactly ?

615
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,180
Well, it's probably
what the trouble's been.

616
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,580
About getting pregnant.

617
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,460
The thing is...

618
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,860
I mean, you know,

619
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,700
I've been...
really happy with Ray.

620
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,340
And now it turns out
there was a reason.

621
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,100
There was a reason
I couldn't conceive.

622
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,020
You're lucky, Laura.

623
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,220
I don't think you
can call yourself a woman

624
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,420
until you're a mother.

625
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,540
The joke is...

626
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,340
all my life
I could do everything.

627
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,860
I mean, I could
do anything, really.

628
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,420
Except the one thing I wanted.

629
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,220
Yes.

630
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,500
That's all.

631
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,140
Well, at least now they'll
be able to deal with it.

632
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,140
That's right.
That's what they're doing.

633
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,180
That's right.

634
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,580
Mm. I'm not worried.

635
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,020
What would be
the point of worrying ?

636
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,940
No, it's not in your hands.

637
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,260
But that's it.

638
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,620
It's in the hands of some
physician I've never even met.

639
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,180
Some surgeon who probably
drinks more martinis

640
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,220
than Ray and...

641
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,220
Oh, Kitty.

642
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,740
I'm mean, of course I'm worried
about Ray.

643
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,580
Come here.

644
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,820
I'm doing fine.

645
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,780
Really.

646
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I know. I know you are.

647
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,180
I'm more worried about Ray.

648
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,340
If anything,
he's not good with this stuff.

649
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,900
Forget about him, hmm ?

650
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,300
Just forget about Ray.

651
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,980
You're sweet.

652
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,940
You know the routine, right ?

653
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,260
Half a can
in the evening, and...

654
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,380
check the water now and then,

655
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,300
and Ray will feed
him in the morning.

656
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,700
Kitty, you didn't mind ?

657
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,580
What ?

658
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,580
I didn't mind what ?

659
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,980
Do you want me to drive you ?

660
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,340
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.

661
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,460
Kitty, it's going to be
all right.

662
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,780
Of course it is.

663
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,100
Bye.

664
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,340
What ?

665
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,580
What do you want ?

666
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,260
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell
has arrived.

667
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,300
Not due till 4:00.

668
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,260
I can't help it.
She's here.

669
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,620
You look a perfect angel.

670
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,820
Don't let the boys
make fun of you.

671
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,420
Fly away, fly.

672
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,060
Virginia.

673
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,020
Leonard thinks it's
the end of civilization...

674
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,980
people who are invited
at 4:00 and arrive at 2:30.

675
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,300
Oh, God.

676
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,700
Barbarians.

677
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,420
Well, we finished lunch
sooner than we imagined.

678
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,660
I've had to send Nelly off
to London for sugar ginger.

679
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,180
Oh, Virginia.

680
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,220
You're not still frightened
of the servants, are you ?

681
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,540
Come on.

682
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,260
And how are you, sister ?

683
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,380
Frantic.

684
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,180
It's been ridiculous in London.

685
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,060
Ridiculous ? How ?

686
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,420
Busy.

687
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,420
Why is busy ridiculous ?

688
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,940
I would have invited you
to our party,

689
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,100
but I knew you wouldn't come.

690
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,540
Did you ?
How did you know that ?

691
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,420
I thought
you never came to town.

692
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,100
That's because
you no longer ask me.

693
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,500
Are you not forbidden to come ?

694
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,060
Do the doctors not forbid it ?

695
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,100
Oh, the doctors.

696
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,340
Do you not pay heed
to your doctors ?

697
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,460
Not when they're a bunch
of contemptible Victorians.

698
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,580
So... what are you saying ?

699
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,060
Are you feeling better ?

700
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,540
Has this vastness
made you stronger ?

701
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,380
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even
crazy people like to be asked.

702
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,940
Nessa ! Nessa !

703
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,900
Nessa ! Nessa !

704
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,140
Hello, changelings.

705
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,820
What have you got ?

706
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,020
What have you found ?

707
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,460
We found a bird.

708
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,020
Did you ?

709
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,020
Yes.

710
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,620
Where did you find that ?

711
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,540
I think it must have
fallen from a tree.

712
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,940
Oh, my goodness.

713
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,580
Just look at him.

714
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,820
We might be able to save him.

715
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,300
Save him ?

716
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,380
I think you have
to be careful, Quentin.

717
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,380
There's a time to die,

718
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,700
and it may be
the bird's time.

719
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,620
Come on, let's pick some grass

720
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,180
to make a grave.

721
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,140
- Oh, Julian.
- I'm just saying.

722
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,820
Then at least there'll be
a bed for him to die on.

723
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,940
Come on, Nessa,
let's make a grave.

724
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,940
Nessa, come on !

725
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,180
Oh...

726
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,980
Very well, I'm coming.

727
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,220
Wait for me then.

728
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,780
Angelica, will
you be all right ?

729
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,820
Stay with your aunt.

730
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,940
You're going too fast.

731
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,860
Do you think she'd like roses ?

732
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,180
Is it a she ?

733
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,940
Yes, the females are larger.

734
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,620
And less colorful.

735
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,340
What happens when we die ?

736
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,100
What happens ?

737
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,300
We return to the place
that we came from.

738
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,140
I don't remember
where I came from.

739
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,620
Nor do I.

740
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,180
She looks very small.

741
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,260
Yes.

742
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,820
Yes, that's one
of the things that happens...

743
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,300
we look smaller.

744
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,500
But very peaceful.

745
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,940
Oh, is it done ?

746
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,140
Have we finished ?

747
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,060
Is the bird funeral complete ?

748
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,020
Yes.

749
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,380
Very well, then.

750
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,180
Are we to be denied tea
altogether for coming so early ?

751
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,580
No, of course not.

752
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,740
Good.

753
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,740
Come on, Angelica.

754
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,060
Come on, come on, boys.

755
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,100
Let's get some tea.

756
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,020
Nessa, tell him to stop it !

757
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,220
Now stop it, Julian.

758
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,780
Virginia, we're going in.

759
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,980
Virginia !

760
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,180
Hey, bug.

761
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,300
I've got this idea.

762
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,660
We're going
to make another cake.

763
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,100
We're going to make
a better one.

764
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,620
What happened
to the first one ?

765
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,500
And after that...

766
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,140
I think we should go out.

767
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,700
Yes ?

768
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,860
Clarissa, it's Louis.

769
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,340
Louis Waters.

770
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,140
Louis ? Oh, my God.

771
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,100
You're early.

772
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,100
Do you mind ?

773
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,700
Is it all right ?

774
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,380
Oh, why should I mind ?

775
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,500
I'm delighted !

776
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,060
Well, now !

777
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,700
I feel like I'm interrupting.

778
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,660
Oh, why ?!

779
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,100
No.

780
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,900
I know the ceremony
isn't until 5:00,

781
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,180
but I flew in this morning.

782
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,340
Oh, well, Richard's
going to be thrilled.

783
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,780
He'll be thrilled
to see you.

784
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,780
You think so ?

785
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,300
Of course.

786
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,700
What are we doing ?
We should go in.

787
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,140
Are you all right ?

788
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,780
Yes. It's nothing.

789
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,580
It's just the party.

790
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,100
Oh, right.

791
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,700
Oh, wow !

792
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,660
It's looking beautiful.

793
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,340
Thanks.

794
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,100
Are you still with... ?

795
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,100
Yes, I am.

796
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,020
Still with her. Ten years.

797
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,900
It's crazy.

798
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,940
Why is it crazy ?

799
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,620
No reason.

800
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,140
Would you like something
to drink ?

801
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,780
Some water.

802
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,660
Okay.

803
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,940
Are you still an editor ?

804
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,140
Oh, sure.

805
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,500
With the same publisher ?

806
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,100
Mm-hmm.

807
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,940
How's San Francisco ?

808
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,900
Oh, it's one of those cities
people tell you to like.

809
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,820
Richard said he thought

810
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,900
you were happy out there.

811
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,860
Oh, great.

812
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,820
So now the illness
makes him psychic.

813
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,100
You have to prepare
yourself, Louis.

814
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,380
He's very changed.

815
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,420
I read the book.

816
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,620
Oh, God...

817
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,540
Exactly.

818
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,300
I thought you were
meant to do more

819
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,900
than just change people's names.

820
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,900
Well...

821
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,100
Isn't it meant to be fiction ?

822
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,780
He even had you living

823
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,300
on 10th Street.

824
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,380
It isn't me.

825
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Isn't it ?

826
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,700
You know how Richard is.

827
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,740
It's a fantasy.

828
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,220
A whole chapter on

829
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,940
<i>Should she buy
some nail polish ?

830
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,260
And then, guess what ?

831
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,300
After 50 pages, she doesn't.

832
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,300
The whole thing seems to go on
for eternity.

833
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,260
Nothing happens.

834
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,220
And then, wham !

835
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,620
For no reason,
she kills herself.

836
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,900
His mother

837
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,980
kills herself.

838
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,620
Yeah, sure, his mother,
but still for no reason.

839
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,860
Well, I...

840
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,900
Out of the blue.

841
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,500
I know the book is tough,
but I liked it.

842
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,580
I know.

843
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,980
Only one thing upset me.

844
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,220
What's that ?

845
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,180
What upset you ?

846
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,580
Well...

847
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,460
that there wasn't more
about you.

848
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,660
That's kind.

849
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,180
I went back to Wellfleet.

850
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,380
You did ?

851
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,340
One day.

852
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,460
I didn't tell you ?

853
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,180
No.

854
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,180
But then, I never see you.

855
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,340
You remember the house.

856
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,860
It's still there.

857
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,900
I think you're courageous.

858
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,700
Courageous ? Why ?

859
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,460
To dare go visit.

860
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,660
What I mean is...

861
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,460
to face the fact

862
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,820
that we have lost
those feelings forever.

863
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,020
Shit !

864
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,900
Clarissa ?

865
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,100
Um...

866
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,100
I don't know what's happening.

867
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,060
I'm sorry.

868
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,500
I seem to be in some strange

869
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,020
sort of mood.

870
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,020
I'm sorry.

871
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,860
It's, uh, it's very rude of me.

872
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,140
I seem to be unraveling.

873
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,140
I shouldn't have come.

874
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,180
No, it's not you.

875
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,020
It's not you.

876
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,940
It's more like having
a presentiment.

877
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,500
Do you know what I'm saying ?

878
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,580
Oh, God,
it's probably just nerves

879
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,540
about the party, you know ?

880
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,020
Bad hostess !

881
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,620
Clarissa, what's happened ?

882
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,380
Jesus !

883
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,700
What is it ?!

884
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,140
Oh ! Oh, God !

885
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,980
Do you want me to go ?

886
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,620
No, don't go ! Don't...

887
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,380
Don't go.

888
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,220
Explain to me
why this is happening.

889
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,580
Don't... don't touch me.

890
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,820
Jesus.

891
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,940
It's better if you don't.

892
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,540
It's just too much.

893
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,380
You fly in from San Francisco,

894
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,220
and I've been nursing Richard
for years.

895
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,220
And all the time,
I've held myself together...

896
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,700
no problem.

897
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,180
I know.

898
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,020
One morning, in Wellfleet...

899
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,340
you were there,
we were all there...

900
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,820
I'd been sleeping with him,

901
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,860
and I was out
on the back porch.

902
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,660
He came out behind me,

903
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,380
and he put his hand
on my shoulder.

904
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,100
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.

905
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,220
That's...

906
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,940
That's when...

907
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,700
From then on, I've...
been stuck.

908
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,780
Stuck ?

909
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,940
Yep.

910
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,340
Yeah.

911
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,260
With the name, I mean.

912
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,260
And now you walk in.

913
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,420
To see you

914
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,820
walk in...
because I never see you.

915
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,220
Look at you.

916
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:06,500
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

917
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,420
It was you he stayed with.

918
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,420
It was you he lived with.

919
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,460
I had one summer.

920
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,820
The day I left him,

921
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,260
I got on a train
and made my way across Europe.

922
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,740
I felt free
for the first time in years.

923
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,580
So... tell me about
San Francisco.

924
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,860
What's to tell ?

925
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,420
I still teach drama
to idiots, mostly.

926
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,980
They can't all be idiots.

927
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,140
No, no. In fact,

928
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,100
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

929
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,300
I've fallen in love.

930
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,420
Really ?

931
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
Yes.

932
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,420
With a student.

933
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,580
With a student.

934
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,260
Exactly.

935
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,180
I know.

936
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,540
You think,
Am I still up for this ?

937
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,460
All this intensity,
all those arguments,

938
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,220
doors being slammed.

939
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,100
Well, you know what it's like.

940
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,540
Are you feeling better ?

941
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,740
A little.

942
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,300
Thank you.

943
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,140
You think I'm ridiculous ?

944
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,380
Ridiculous ?

945
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,980
Fortunate, too.

946
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,220
I'm going to leave you
at Mrs. Latch's.

947
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,140
I have to do something.

948
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,380
Mommy, I don't want to go.

949
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,500
You have to. I'm sorry.

950
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,660
I have something to do
before Daddy gets home.

951
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,260
Hello.

952
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,780
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

953
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,420
My boy's not very happy.

954
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,660
Mommy, I don't want
to do this.

955
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,100
I have to go, honey.

956
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,540
Your mommy has things
she has to do.

957
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,020
Come in, I got cookies.

958
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,300
Okay, baby ?

959
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,740
You have to be brave now.

960
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,140
Don't worry now.

961
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,540
It's going to be fine.

962
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,540
Well...

963
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,500
Honey !

964
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,060
Come on. Come on, darling.

965
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,700
Mommy !

966
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,660
- Stop it.
- No !

967
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,900
Darling, stop it.

968
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,020
Mommy !

969
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,140
- All right.
- Mommy !

970
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,020
Mommy !

971
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,380
Mommy !

972
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,340
Come on.

973
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,780
Mommy !

974
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,300
Mommy !

975
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,020
No !

976
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,380
Breakfast is served

977
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,300
between 7:00 and 11:00
in the Regency Room,

978
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,580
and room service is available

979
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,140
24 hours.

980
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,340
Thank you, ma'am.

981
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,900
Is there anything else
you need ?

982
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,540
Yes, um...

983
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,460
No.

984
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,100
Not to be disturbed.

985
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,700
<i>'Did it matter, then ? '
She asked herself,

986
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,100
<i>walking toward Bon Street.

987
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:09,260
<i>Did it matter that she must
inevitably cease completely ?

988
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,900
<i>All this must go on
without her.

989
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,020
<i>Did she resent it ?

990
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,940
<i>Or did it not become consoling

991
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,780
<i>to believe that death
ended absolutely ?

992
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,140
<i>It is possible to die.

993
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,420
It is possible...

994
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,860
<i>...to die.

995
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,820
There was a lovely coat
for Angelica at Harrod's,

996
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,340
then nothing for the boys.

997
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,500
It seems so unfair.

998
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,100
Why should Angelica
be favored ?

999
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,500
Virginia ?

1000
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,780
Virginia ?

1001
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,220
Virginia !

1002
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,220
What are you thinking about ?

1003
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,860
Are you still with us ?

1004
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:26,620
Your aunt's a very
lucky woman, Angelica...

1005
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,060
because she has two lives.

1006
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,460
She has the life
she's leading,

1007
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,020
and also the book she's writing.

1008
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,180
This makes her very
fortunate indeed.

1009
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,220
What were you thinking about ?

1010
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,220
I was going to kill
my heroine...

1011
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,620
but I've changed my mind.

1012
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,660
I... I can't.

1013
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,140
I fear I may have to kill
someone else instead.

1014
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,980
Oh, Quentin !

1015
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,300
We're ready !

1016
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,420
A fascinating visit.

1017
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,660
We enjoyed it thoroughly.

1018
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,940
Do you have to go already ?

1019
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,820
I do wish you wouldn't go.

1020
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,780
Oh, Virginia,

1021
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,580
the last thing you want
is our noisiness.

1022
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:04,100
My hopeless, clumsy boys.

1023
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,940
Say good-bye, boys.

1024
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,300
Bye !

1025
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,740
You'll return to what ?

1026
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,180
Tonight ?

1027
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:18,420
Oh, just some...
insufferable dinner.

1028
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,340
Not even you could
envy, Virginia.

1029
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,820
But I do.

1030
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,580
Say something, Nessa.

1031
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,220
Didn't you think
I seemed better ?

1032
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,540
Yes...

1033
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,940
Yes... Virginia,
you seemed better.

1034
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,660
You think...

1035
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,980
You think I may one day escape ?

1036
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,140
One day. One...

1037
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,700
Nessa.

1038
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,260
Nessa !

1039
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,860
Come on, Nessa.

1040
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,460
Come, Angelica, we must go.

1041
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,860
Come on !

1042
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:42,820
Good-bye.

1043
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,860
Good-bye, little girl.

1044
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,540
Angelica !

1045
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,940
The train !

1046
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,660
We're going to miss the train.

1047
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,140
Come on. Hurry up.

1048
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,140
Big step.

1049
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,780
Come on, come on, come on !

1050
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,380
I want to go home.

1051
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,340
Yeah, all right.

1052
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,700
We stayed too long,
we've missed the train.

1053
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,860
Stay close.

1054
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,340
I'm sorry, I know.

1055
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,740
I tried to get here earlier.

1056
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,300
I tried, okay ? Don't start.

1057
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,140
I know,

1058
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,820
it's just incredibly important
because it's your party.

1059
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,380
Julia, how have you been doing ?

1060
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,860
I'm fine.

1061
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,700
Come here.

1062
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,460
What have you been doing ?

1063
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,820
Well, studying, Mom.

1064
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:55,620
Um...

1065
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,540
So, what should I do ? Chairs ?

1066
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,780
No. Let's clear off the desk
first.

1067
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,660
You can take it
into the bedroom.

1068
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,020
I bumped into Louis Waters.

1069
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,300
Oh, you did ?

1070
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,500
Where ?

1071
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,460
In the street.

1072
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,860
They're all here, aren't they ?

1073
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,940
All the ghosts.

1074
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,660
All of the ghosts are
assembling for the party.

1075
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,380
He's so weird.

1076
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,820
Oh, what ?

1077
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,140
You can't see that ?

1078
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,580
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird ?

1079
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,180
I can see that he's sad.

1080
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,500
Well... all your friends
are sad.

1081
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,460
You've been crying.
What's happening ?

1082
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,540
All it is,
I looked around this room,

1083
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,340
<i>and I thought,
I'm giving a party.

1084
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,900
<i>All I want to do
is give a party.

1085
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,180
And ?

1086
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,940
I know why he does it ;
he does it deliberately.

1087
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,860
Oh, is this Richard ?

1088
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,380
Of course.

1089
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,140
He did it this morning.

1090
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,100
He gives me that look.

1091
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,540
What look ?

1092
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:09,060
To say...

1093
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,780
<i>Your life is... trivial.

1094
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,700
<i>You are so trivial.

1095
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,100
Just...

1096
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,620
daily stuff, you know.

1097
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,980
Schedules and parties
and... details.

1098
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,700
That's what he means... by it,
that is what he's saying.

1099
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,860
Mom, it only matters
if you think it's true.

1100
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,060
Well ?

1101
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,980
Do you ? Tell me.

1102
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,020
When I'm with him, I feel...

1103
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,260
Yes, I am living.

1104
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,340
And when I'm not with him...

1105
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,900
Yes, everything does seem
sort of s...

1106
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,180
...silly.

1107
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,820
I don't mean with you.

1108
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,060
Oh, I...

1109
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,780
God. Jesus.

1110
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,940
Never with you.

1111
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,060
It's all the rest of it.

1112
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,340
Sally ?

1113
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,300
The rest of it.

1114
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,140
False comfort.

1115
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,660
Because ?

1116
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,660
<i>If you say to me,
When were you happiest ?

1117
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,820
Mom...

1118
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,300
<i>Tell me the moment
you were happiest.

1119
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,420
I know, I know,
it was years ago.

1120
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,420
Yeah.

1121
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,860
All you're saying is...
you were once young.

1122
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,300
I remember one morning...

1123
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:55,340
getting up at dawn,

1124
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:59,540
there was such a sense
of possibility.

1125
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,460
You know ?
That feeling ?

1126
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,540
Hmm ?

1127
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,860
And I remember
thinking to myself,

1128
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,700
<i>So, this is the
beginning of happiness.

1129
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,500
<i>This is where it starts.

1130
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,540
<i>And, of course, there
will always be more.

1131
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,340
It never occurred to me

1132
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,340
it wasn't the beginning.

1133
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,140
It was happiness.

1134
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:31,660
It was the moment...

1135
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,860
right then.

1136
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,260
Ah, Nelly, good evening.
I was wondering

1137
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,420
if you'd seen Mrs. Woolf.

1138
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,380
I thought you knew, sir.

1139
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,380
Mrs. Woolf has gone out.

1140
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,020
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

1141
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:07,180
Mr. Woolf, what an
unexpected pleasure.

1142
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,700
Perhaps you could tell me

1143
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,860
exactly what you think
you're doing ?

1144
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,220
What I was doing ?

1145
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,540
I went to look for you,
and you weren't there.

1146
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,060
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.

1147
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,780
You disturb me
when you disappear.

1148
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:18,780
I didn't disappear.

1149
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,900
I went for a walk.

1150
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,460
A walk ?!
Is that all ?

1151
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,100
Just a walk ?

1152
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,860
Virginia, we must go home now.
Nelly's cooking dinner.

1153
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:31,260
She's already had
a very difficult day.

1154
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,020
It's just our obligation
to eat Nelly's dinner.

1155
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,340
There is no such
obligation.

1156
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,620
No such obligation exists.

1157
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,660
Virginia,

1158
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,220
you have an obligation
to your own sanity.

1159
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,300
I have endured this custody !

1160
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,700
I have endured
this imprisonment.

1161
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,020
Oh, Virginia !

1162
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,700
I am attended by
doctors, everywhere.

1163
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:50,540
I am attended by doctors

1164
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,100
who inform me of
my own interests !

1165
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,300
They know your interests.

1166
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,340
They do not !

1167
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,180
They do not speak
for my interests.

1168
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,500
Virginia, I can...

1169
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,860
I can see that it must be
hard for a woman of your...

1170
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,700
- Of what ? Of my what, exactly ?
- Uh, your...

1171
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:03,780
your talents to see

1172
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,700
that she may not be
the best judge

1173
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,900
of her own condition !

1174
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,900
Who, then, is a better judge ?

1175
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,180
You have a history !

1176
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,500
You have a history
of confinement.

1177
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,980
We brought you to Richmond

1178
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,940
because you have a history
of fits, moods, blackouts,

1179
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,460
hearing voices.

1180
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,420
We brought you here

1181
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,860
to save you
from the irrevocable damage

1182
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,980
you intended upon yourself.

1183
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,620
You've tried to kill yourself
twice !

1184
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,780
I live daily with that threat.

1185
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,220
I set up the press...
we set up the printing press

1186
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,260
not just for itself,

1187
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,500
not just purely for itself,
but so that you might have

1188
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,860
a ready source
of absorption and of remedy.

1189
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,100
Like needlework ?

1190
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,260
It was done for you !

1191
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,500
It was done for your betterment !

1192
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,540
It was done out of love !

1193
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,980
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.

1194
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,900
I am ungrateful ?

1195
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,060
You call me ungrateful ?

1196
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,180
My life has been stolen from me.

1197
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,700
I'm living in a town
I have no wish to live in.

1198
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:19,220
I'm living... a life
I have no wish to live.

1199
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,700
How did this happen ?

1200
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,500
It is time for us
to move back to London.

1201
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:48,940
I miss London.

1202
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,940
I miss London life.

1203
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,500
This is not you speaking,
Virginia.

1204
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,980
This is an aspect
of your illness.

1205
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,940
- It's not you.
- It is me. It is my voice.

1206
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,020
It's not your voice.

1207
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,260
It's mine and mine alone.

1208
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,700
This is the voice
that you hear.

1209
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,380
It is not ! It is mine !

1210
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,340
I'm dying in this town !

1211
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,220
If you were thinking clearly,
Virginia,

1212
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,540
you'd recall it was London

1213
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,220
that brought you low.

1214
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,060
If I were thinking clearly...

1215
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,780
If I were thinking clearly...

1216
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,460
We brought you to Richmond
to give you peace.

1217
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,260
If I were thinking clearly,
Leonard,

1218
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,140
I would tell you that I wrestle
alone in the dark,

1219
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:36,300
in the deep dark,
and that only I can know,

1220
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,260
only I can understand
my own condition.

1221
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,100
You live with the threat...
you tell me...

1222
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,980
you live with the threat
of my extinction.

1223
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,460
Leonard, I live with it,

1224
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,980
too.

1225
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,020
This is my right.

1226
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,260
It is the right
of every human being.

1227
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,740
I choose not the suffocating
anesthetic of the suburbs,

1228
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,980
but the violent jolt
of the capital.

1229
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,740
That is my choice.

1230
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,260
The meanest patient,

1231
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,860
yes, even the very lowest
is allowed some say

1232
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:12,460
in the matter of her own
prescription.

1233
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,780
Thereby she defines
her humanity.

1234
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,900
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,

1235
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:31,300
I could be happy in this
quietness.

1236
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:36,500
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death,

1237
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:38,220
I choose death.

1238
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,540
Very well, London, then.

1239
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,020
We'll go back to London.

1240
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,140
You hungry ?

1241
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,740
I'm a little hungry myself.

1242
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,660
Come along.

1243
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,740
London train on platform one !

1244
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:04,820
This is the London train
terminating at Vauxhall.

1245
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:13,660
You cannot find peace
by avoiding life, Leonard.

1246
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,340
This is the London train !

1247
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:28,340
London train on platform one !

1248
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,620
Mommy !

1249
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,260
Mommy !

1250
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,260
Hey. Hey, there, bug.

1251
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,260
Hey, what's wrong ?

1252
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,020
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

1253
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,140
Sorry I'm late.

1254
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,220
He's fine.

1255
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,220
He's been fine.

1256
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,700
He's, he's just happy
to see you.

1257
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,980
Aw, it couldn't have been
that bad, could it ? Hmm ?

1258
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,660
So, you got it cut, then ?

1259
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,540
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.

1260
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,460
Looks great.

1261
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,900
Well, they didn't have
to do very much.

1262
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,580
Well, we had a fine time

1263
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,900
together.

1264
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,860
Thank you very much.

1265
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,660
So, that wasn't too bad, was it ?

1266
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,220
I wasn't gone too long.

1267
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,300
No, you weren't long.

1268
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,100
That's right.

1269
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,460
At one point...

1270
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,420
I don't know.

1271
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:49,780
There was a moment where
I thought I might be longer.

1272
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,580
But I changed my mind.

1273
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,980
What is it, honey ?

1274
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:03,420
Mommy, I love you.

1275
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,540
I love you, too, baby.

1276
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,420
What's wrong ?

1277
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,060
What ?

1278
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,860
Don't worry, honey,
everything's fine.

1279
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,580
We're going to have
a wonderful party,

1280
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:37,300
and we've made your daddy
such a nice cake.

1281
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,220
I love you, sweetheart.

1282
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,660
You're my guy.

1283
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:25,380
Mommy !

1284
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,700
Mommy !

1285
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:24,740
Richard, it's me. I'm early.

1286
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,180
What the hell is going on ?

1287
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,060
Richard !

1288
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,140
What are you doing here ?
You're early !

1289
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,380
Wha-What is going on here ?

1290
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,020
What are you doing ?

1291
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,820
I-I had this wonderful idea.

1292
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,020
I needed some light.
I needed to let in some light !

1293
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,660
Richard, what are you doing ?

1294
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:51,980
I had this fantastic notion.

1295
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:54,180
I took the Xanax
and the Ritalin together.

1296
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,660
It-it never occurred to me.

1297
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,340
Richard...

1298
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,460
Don't come near me !

1299
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:07,580
It seemed to me I needed
to let in some light.

1300
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:13,180
What do you think ?
I cleared away all the windows.

1301
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,740
All right, Richard,
do me one simple favor.

1302
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:16,900
Come. Come sit.

1303
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,780
I don't think I can make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1304
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,900
You don't have to go
to the party.

1305
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,180
You don't have to go
to the ceremony.

1306
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,820
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1307
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,340
You can do as you like.

1308
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,300
But I still have to face
the hours, don't I ?

1309
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,380
I mean, the hours
after the party,

1310
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,620
and the hours after that...

1311
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,620
You do have good days still.

1312
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,380
You know you do.

1313
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,660
Not really.

1314
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,060
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...

1315
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,500
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...

1316
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,820
not really true.

1317
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,180
Are they here ?

1318
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,940
Who ?

1319
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,740
The voices.

1320
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,540
Oh, the voices are always here.

1321
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:02,180
And it's the voices that you're
hearing now, isn't it ?

1322
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,900
No, no, no, no.

1323
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:07,220
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

1324
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:15,100
I've stayed alive for you,

1325
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:16,940
but now you have to let me go.

1326
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,620
Richard, I...

1327
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,660
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1328
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,900
Wait.

1329
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,500
Tell me a story.

1330
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,100
What about ?

1331
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,940
Tell me a story from your day.

1332
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,940
I, um...

1333
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,860
I-I got up...

1334
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,500
Yes ?

1335
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:43,780
...and I went out, and, uh,
I went to buy flowers,

1336
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,660
Like Mrs. Dalloway,
in the book, you know ?

1337
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,060
Yes.

1338
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,140
And it was a beautiful morning.

1339
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,620
Was it ?

1340
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,620
Yes, it was so beautiful.

1341
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:53,300
It was so fresh.

1342
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,020
Oh, fresh, was it ?

1343
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,060
Yes.

1344
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:00,260
Like a...

1345
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,980
like a morning on the beach ?

1346
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:04,540
Yes.

1347
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,660
Like that ?

1348
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,500
Yes.

1349
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:11,300
Like that morning when you
walked out of that old house,

1350
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,420
and you were, you were 18,
and maybe I was 19.

1351
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,220
Yes.

1352
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,340
I was 19 years old,

1353
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:22,780
and I'd never seen
anything so beautiful.

1354
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:24,820
You...

1355
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,700
coming out of a glass door

1356
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,180
in the early morning,
still sleepy.

1357
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:31,940
Isn't it strange ?

1358
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:37,660
Most ordinary morning
in anybody's life.

1359
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,980
I'm afraid I can't make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1360
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,340
The party...

1361
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,340
doesn't matter.

1362
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,740
You've been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.

1363
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,900
I love you.

1364
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,300
<i>I don't think two people

1365
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,660
<i>could've been happier
than we've been.

1366
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,340
Oh, God, no !

1367
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,100
Happy birthday.

1368
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,420
Happy birthday, Dan.

1369
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,700
This is perfect.

1370
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:28,460
This is just perfect.

1371
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,620
Oh, do you think so ?

1372
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,740
Do you really think so ?

1373
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:32,700
Why, sure.

1374
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,500
You must've been
working all day.

1375
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,180
Well, that's what
we were doing.

1376
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,820
Weren't we, bug ?

1377
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,980
Been working all day.

1378
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,140
This is just fantastic.

1379
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,660
It's what I've always wanted.

1380
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,420
Oh, Dan.

1381
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,780
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.

1382
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:47,500
I'll tell you
how it all happened.

1383
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,420
Don't.

1384
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:50,540
I want to.

1385
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:53,420
I want to tell him the story.

1386
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,420
What happened...

1387
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,020
when I was in the war.

1388
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,500
At war, I found myself

1389
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,660
thinking about this girl
that I had seen...

1390
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,060
I had never met her...

1391
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,380
at high school,

1392
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,900
this... strange,

1393
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:08,860
fragile-looking girl
named Laura McGrath.

1394
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:13,460
Yeah.

1395
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,540
And she was shy...

1396
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:18,060
and she was interesting.

1397
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,420
And... well,
your mother won't mind if

1398
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,380
I tell you this, Richie.

1399
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:22,900
She was the sort of
girl that you see

1400
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:23,980
sitting mostly on her own.

1401
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,700
And I'll tell you...

1402
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,180
sometimes, when I was
in the South Pacific,

1403
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:29,860
the fact is

1404
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,180
that I used to think

1405
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,740
about this girl.

1406
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:33,740
Dan.

1407
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:35,180
I used to think

1408
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,100
about bringing her to a house,

1409
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,340
to a life.

1410
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:42,380
Pretty much like this.

1411
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,500
And it was the thought
of the happiness...

1412
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:51,380
the thought of this woman,

1413
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:52,500
the thought of this life...

1414
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,260
that's what kept me going.

1415
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:58,060
I had an idea of our happiness.

1416
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,780
Why does someone have to die ?

1417
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,180
Leonard...

1418
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,900
In your book,
you said someone had to die.

1419
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:34,860
Hmm.

1420
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,940
Why ?

1421
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:41,340
Is that a stupid question ?

1422
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:42,700
No.

1423
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,060
I imagine my question is stupid.

1424
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,700
Not at all.

1425
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,220
Well ?

1426
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,740
Someone has to die

1427
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,380
in order that the rest of us
should value life more.

1428
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,260
It's contrast.

1429
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,420
And who will die ?

1430
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:06,700
Tell me.

1431
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,260
The poet will die.

1432
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,900
The visionary.

1433
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:29,740
What are you doing ?

1434
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,980
I'm brushing my teeth.

1435
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,060
Are you coming to bed ?

1436
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,580
Yeah, in a minute.

1437
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,780
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

1438
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,540
I ran into Ray.

1439
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,500
He said Kitty had to
go to the hospital.

1440
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:55,980
I know.

1441
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,260
Nothing serious.

1442
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,420
He said just a checkup.

1443
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,860
I'm terrified.

1444
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,900
Why ?

1445
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,420
Only I knew
that she could disappear.

1446
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:12,460
Maybe you could

1447
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,220
go see her
in the morning, honey.

1448
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,220
I was going to.

1449
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,900
I was going to stop by.

1450
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:28,620
I've had a wonderful day,

1451
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:31,100
and I have you to thank.

1452
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:40,620
Come to bed, honey.

1453
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,660
I'm coming.

1454
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:53,780
Are you coming ?

1455
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:55,700
Yes.

1456
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:15,420
What ?

1457
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,540
I was hoping
you were going to bed.

1458
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,620
I am.

1459
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,580
I am going to bed.

1460
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,780
What, then ?

1461
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:33,940
All else is clear.

1462
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,620
The outline of the story
is planned,

1463
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,420
now one thing only.

1464
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:41,260
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.

1465
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:23,700
You're Laura Brown.

1466
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:28,420
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.

1467
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,420
Of course.

1468
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,860
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.

1469
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,660
Please come in.

1470
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,940
My friend Sally
is in the kitchen,

1471
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,260
and my daughter.

1472
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,100
I'll take this.

1473
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,980
We were having a party.

1474
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:59,220
We were going to have a party.

1475
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,460
I was lucky.

1476
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,220
I got the last plane
from Toronto.

1477
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:06,660
So, that's the monster.

1478
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:08,820
Hope I did the right thing.

1479
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,780
I found your number
in his phone book.

1480
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:15,060
Yes, he had it.

1481
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:17,540
We didn't speak often.

1482
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:32,180
It's a terrible thing,
Miss Vaughan... to outlive

1483
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:33,820
your whole family.

1484
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:39,620
Richard's father died.

1485
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:42,980
Yes, he-he died of cancer
quite young.

1486
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,860
And Richard's sister is dead.

1487
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:53,340
Obviously, you...
feel unworthy.

1488
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:58,180
Gives you feelings
of unworthiness.

1489
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:01,300
You survive and they don't.

1490
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,660
Have you read the poems ?

1491
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,140
Oh, yes. Oh...

1492
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,700
I also read the novel.

1493
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:25,980
You see, uh, people say
the novel is difficult.

1494
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:29,580
Uh... I know.

1495
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,460
They say that.

1496
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,660
I know.

1497
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:43,340
He had me die in the novel.

1498
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:45,980
I-I-I know why he did that.

1499
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:51,780
It hurt, of course.

1500
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:54,060
I can't pretend it didn't hurt,
but I...

1501
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,460
I know why he did it.

1502
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:04,060
You left Richard
when he was a child.

1503
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:09,900
I left both my children.

1504
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,540
I abandoned them.

1505
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,780
They say it's the worst thing
a mother can do.

1506
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:35,940
You have a daughter.

1507
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,860
Yes...

1508
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:44,740
But I never met Julia's father.

1509
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,900
You so wanted a child.

1510
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:51,180
That's right.

1511
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:54,100
You're a lucky woman.

1512
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,540
There are times
when you don't belong,

1513
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:08,540
and you think you're going
to kill yourself.

1514
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:16,900
Once, I went to a hotel.

1515
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,980
Later that night, I made a plan.

1516
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,420
The plan was
I would leave my family

1517
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:30,540
when my second child was born...

1518
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:32,980
and that's what I did.

1519
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:36,660
I got up one morning,

1520
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,140
made breakfast,

1521
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:42,540
went to the bus stop,

1522
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:45,660
got on a bus.

1523
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:47,900
I'd left a note.

1524
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:56,580
I got a job in a library
in Canada.

1525
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,740
It would...

1526
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:10,420
be wonderful to say
you regretted it.

1527
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,420
It would be easy.

1528
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:20,020
But what does it mean ?

1529
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:23,940
What does it mean to regret...

1530
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,780
when you have no choice ?

1531
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:39,100
It's what you can bear.

1532
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,540
There it is.

1533
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,900
No one's going to forgive me.

1534
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:58,900
It was death.

1535
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,580
I chose life.

1536
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,420
Time to take your coat off.

1537
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:45,540
I thought you might like
a cup of tea.

1538
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,220
Oh my goodness.

1539
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:49,060
Thank you, dear.

1540
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:51,140
I feel like I'm stealing
your room.

1541
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,060
Um, we put the food away,

1542
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:55,900
so, if you're at all hungry
in the night,

1543
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,060
just help yourself.

1544
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,260
Oh, I will.

1545
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:00,380
Where will you sleep ?

1546
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:01,700
Oh, the sofa.

1547
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,580
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1548
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,460
Good night, sweetheart.

1549
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,540
Good night.

1550
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
<i>Dear Leonard,

1551
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:42,540
<i>to look life in the face...

1552
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:48,620
<i>always to look life in the face,

1553
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:53,900
<i>and to know it for what it is.

1554
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:59,300
<i>At last, to know it,

1555
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:02,900
<i>to love it for what it is,

1556
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:06,460
<i>and then...

1557
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:09,140
<i>to put it away.

1558
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,940
<i>Leonard...

1559
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:20,420
<i>always the years between us,

1560
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:24,060
<i>always the years...

1561
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:29,260
<i>always... the love...

1562
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,460
<i>always...

1563
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,860
<i>the hours.

1564
01:45:35,099 --> 01:45:38,093
