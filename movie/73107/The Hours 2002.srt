1
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:29,924
Dearest, I feel certain

2
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,763
that I am going mad again.

3
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:33,123
I feel we can't go

4
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:35,163
through another of these terrible times,

5
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:37,323
and I... shan't

6
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:40,603
recover this time.

7
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:44,963
I begin to hear voices, and can't concentrate.

8
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:50,003
So, I am doing what seems to be

9
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,963
the best thing to do.

10
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:08,923
You have given me

11
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,723
the greatest possible happiness.

12
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:14,203
You have been in every way

13
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:16,483
all that anyone could be.

14
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:23,003
I know that I am spoiling your life,

15
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,643
and without me, you could work.

16
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,683
And you will,

17
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,563
I know.

18
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:35,803
You see, I can't even write this properly.

19
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,643
What I want to say is that I owe

20
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:43,283
all the happiness of my life to you.

21
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,203
You have been entirely patient with me...

22
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:49,562
and

23
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,282
incredibly good.

24
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:53,562
Everything's gone

25
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:56,202
from me but the certainty

26
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:58,722
of your goodness.

27
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,522
I can't go on spoiling your life any longer.

28
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:07,242
I don't think two people could have been happier

29
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,682
than we have been.

30
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,242
Virginia.

31
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,441
Good morning, Doctor.

32
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:05,881
Mr. Woolf.

33
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:08,001
No worse, I think.

34
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,921
I see.

35
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:13,921
The main thing is to keep her where she is, and calm.

36
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,201
Friday, then.

37
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,358
Good morning, Leonard.

38
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:41,638
Good morning, Virginia.

39
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,998
How was your sleep ?

40
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:44,598
Uneventful.

41
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,318
The headaches ?

42
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,078
No. No headaches.

43
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,478
Doctor seemed pleased.

44
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,078
That's all from this morning ?

45
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,478
Yes. This young man has submitted his manuscript.

46
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,038
I've found three errors of fact

47
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,958
and two spelling mistakes,

48
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,438
and I'm not yet on page four.

49
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,438
Have you had breakfast ?

50
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,518
Yes.

51
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:06,678
Liar.

52
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,678
Virginia, it's not my insistence.

53
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,998
It's your own doctor's.

54
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,598
I'm going to send

55
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,958
Nelly up with some fruit and a bun.

56
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,678
Right. Lunch, then.

57
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,678
Proper lunch,

58
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,318
husband and wife sitting down together...

59
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:23,637
soup, pudding

60
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,397
and all.

61
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,677
By force if necessary.

62
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,797
Leonard, I believe I may have a first sentence.

63
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:39,037
Work, then.

64
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,517
Then you must eat.

65
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:46,036
Mrs. Dalloway said...

66
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:52,276
she would buy the flowers... herself.

67
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,516
Mrs. Dalloway said

68
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:56,716
she would buy the flowers herself.

69
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:01,396
Sally, I think I'll buy the flowers myself.

70
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,516
What ?

71
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,596
What flowers ?

72
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,276
Oh, shit. I forgot.

73
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:10,996
You're never going to be a big boy

74
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,116
if you don't eat your breakfast.

75
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,516
You're going to be the big brother.

76
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:15,596
It's a very important job.

77
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:16,756
Happy birthday.

78
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:18,436
- Morning, honey. - Oh, Dan.

79
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:20,996
Roses on your own birthday.

80
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,356
You're too much. Really.

81
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:23,836
He'll eat it

82
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:24,916
now that you're here.

83
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,156
It's your birthday.

84
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:28,756
You shouldn't be out buying me flowers.

85
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:30,356
Well, you were still sleeping.

86
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,036
So ?

87
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,956
Well, we decided it would be better

88
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:35,836
if we let you sleep in a little, didn't we ?

89
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,076
Morning, bug.

90
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:41,876
You need to rest, Laura.

91
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,476
You're only four months away.

92
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,596
Dan, don't.

93
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,076
I'm fine.

94
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,996
I'm just tired.

95
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:51,236
I've been telling him he's got to eat his breakfast.

96
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:52,436
That's true.

97
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,156
So, it's a beautiful day.

98
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:56,476
What are you two going to be doing with it ?

99
00:11:56,557 --> 00:12:00,036
We've got our plans, don't we ?

100
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:01,235
What plans ?

101
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,555
Hmm...

102
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:05,155
Well, it wouldn't be much of a party,

103
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:06,155
would it, if I told you

104
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:07,235
every detail in advance ?

105
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:08,435
Well, I better just stop

106
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:10,035
asking questions then, huh ?

107
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,235
That the time ?

108
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,555
I better get going.

109
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:14,515
Have a good day.

110
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,595
You, too.

111
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,635
Dan, happy birthday.

112
00:12:20,716 --> 00:12:21,795
Oh, thank you.

113
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:56,155
You need to finish your breakfast.

114
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,834
Oh, I'm going to make a cake.

115
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,954
That's what I'm going to do.

116
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,954
I'm going to make the cake for Daddy's birthday.

117
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:31,514
Mommy, can I help ?

118
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,874
Can I help make the cake ?

119
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:36,954
Of course you can, sweet pea.

120
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:40,314
I'm not going to do anything without you.

121
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:41,354
No, of course.

122
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,074
You have to come.

123
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,234
Of course.

124
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,314
Well, I always wanted you

125
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:49,274
and everybody involved in the actual ceremony.

126
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,994
I don't know.

127
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:52,394
Around 60.

128
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,794
Well, it will.

129
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,634
It'll mean so much.

130
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,914
The whole occasion.

131
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,914
It's the least I can do

132
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,914
to have a nice dinner and say thank you

133
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,034
to everybody.

134
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,634
You've done so much for him.

135
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:05,114
Oh, I take that as a yes.

136
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:06,674
He'll be thrilled.

137
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:07,954
Oh, my God.

138
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:11,034
I'm thrilled. Oh, good.

139
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,434
What if nobody comes ?

140
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,114
This is Clarissa Vaughan.

141
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:16,394
Yes, I am just confirming

142
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,674
that you're sending a car to pick me up first.

143
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:19,994
Yeah.

144
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,594
- Hi, Clarissa. - Hi, can't talk.

145
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:24,194
And then we're going over to 679 Hudson,

146
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,074
which is at 9th and 14th.

147
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,634
Then you will take me uptown and you will wait for us.

148
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,234
And it'll be over at seven.

149
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:42,873
Flowers ! What a beautiful morning.

150
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:44,793
Hi, Clarissa. How are you ?

151
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,193
I'm having a party.

152
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:50,113
My friend Richard's won the Carruthers.

153
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:51,513
Well, that's just terrific...

154
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,993
if I knew what it was.

155
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:57,593
It's a poetry prize for a life's work.

156
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,393
It's the most prestigious.

157
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:01,833
For a poet, it's the best you can do.

158
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:03,073
Oh, very good.

159
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,833
So, what would you like ?

160
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,673
The lilies are perfect.

161
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,713
No. Too morbid.

162
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:10,793
Hydrangeas, I think.

163
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:12,233
And, um...

164
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:16,193
Oh, oh, let's just have buckets of roses.

165
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:22,553
And... I think I'm going to take these with me.

166
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:23,353
Rodney ?

167
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:24,833
Okay.

168
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:25,833
Thank you.

169
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:30,193
I actually tried to read Richard's novel.

170
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,073
You did ?

171
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,793
Oh, I know. It's not easy.

172
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:37,953
I know.

173
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:40,393
It did take him ten years to write.

174
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:43,313
Maybe it just takes another ten to read.

175
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:47,033
It's you, isn't it ?

176
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,433
What is ?

177
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:49,913
In the novel, isn't it meant to be you ?

178
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:52,593
Oh, I see.

179
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,073
Yeah.

180
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,513
Sort of.

181
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:56,953
I mean, in a way.

182
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,232
You know, Richard's a writer.

183
00:15:58,313 --> 00:15:59,512
That's what he is.

184
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,032
He uses things which actually happen.

185
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:02,472
Yeah.

186
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,712
And years ago, he and I were students.

187
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:06,832
That's true.

188
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,352
But, you know, then he changes things.

189
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,192
Oh, sure.

190
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:11,312
I don't mean in a bad way.

191
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:18,872
It's more like... he makes them his own.

192
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:30,472
A woman's whole life...

193
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,752
in a single day,

194
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,512
just one day...

195
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:40,352
and in that day,

196
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,312
her whole life.

197
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:46,032
This is what we need.

198
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,472
Shortening...

199
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:48,151
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

200
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,471
Yes, it's me !

201
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,951
Oh... It's me.

202
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,191
Come in.

203
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:57,791
Richard, it's a beautiful morning.

204
00:17:57,872 --> 00:18:01,191
How about we let in a little more light ?

205
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:02,951
Is it still morning ?

206
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,831
Yes, it is.

207
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,991
Have I died ?

208
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,031
Good morning, my dear.

209
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:14,911
Any visitors ?

210
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:15,911
Yes.

211
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,071
Are they still here ?

212
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,551
No. They've gone.

213
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,391
Mm. How'd they look ?

214
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,351
Today ?

215
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,391
Sort of like black fire.

216
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,751
I mean, sort of light

217
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:30,151
and dark at the same time.

218
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:32,351
There was one a bit like an electrified jellyfish.

219
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,671
They were singing.

220
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:37,190
May have been Greek.

221
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,150
So the ceremony is at 5:00.

222
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:42,430
Do you remember ?

223
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,670
And then...

224
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:52,030
the party is right after.

225
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,550
They did bring you breakfast, didn't they ?

226
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:05,270
What a question. Of course.

227
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:06,310
Richard, you did eat it ?

228
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,670
Well, can you see it ?

229
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,830
Is it here ?

230
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:10,830
Any breakfast lying around ?

231
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:13,150
No, I don't see it.

232
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,910
Well, then I must have eaten it, mustn't I ?

233
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:17,270
I suppose.

234
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,350
Does it matter ?

235
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,230
Of course, it matters.

236
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,550
You know what the doctors say.

237
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:33,350
Have you been skipping pills ?

238
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,670
Clarissa, I can't take this.

239
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:35,630
Take what ?

240
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:36,910
Having to be proud and brave

241
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,350
in front of everybody.

242
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,430
Oh. Honey, it's not a performance.

243
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:41,510
Of course it is.

244
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,710
I got the prize for my performance.

245
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,710
Well, that is nonsense.

246
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,830
I got the prize for having AIDS and going nuts

247
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:48,030
and being brave about it.

248
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:50,350
I actually got the prize for having come through.

249
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:52,110
It's not true.

250
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,670
- For surviving, that's what - It's not true.

251
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:55,150
I got the prize for. Oh, you think they

252
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,269
would have given it to me if I were healthy ?

253
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,229
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

254
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,829
Is it here somewhere ?

255
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,789
What ?

256
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,229
The prize. I'd like to look at it.

257
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,509
No, you haven't gotten it yet.

258
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,109
It's tonight.

259
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,669
Are you sure ?

260
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,829
Um...

261
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,029
I remember the ceremony perfectly.

262
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,509
I seem to have fallen out of time.

263
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,029
Richard.

264
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,709
Richard...

265
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,429
it's a party,

266
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,709
and it's only a party.

267
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,869
Hmm ? Populated entirely

268
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,549
by people who respect and admire you.

269
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,069
A small party, is it ?

270
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,709
A select party, is it ?

271
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,189
Your friends.

272
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,029
I thought I lost all my friends.

273
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,109
I thought I drove my friends crazy.

274
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,109
Jesus.

275
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,309
Oh, Mrs. Dalloway,

276
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,789
always giving parties to cover the silence.

277
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:18,588
Richard...

278
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,108
You won't need to do anything.

279
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:26,068
All you have to do is appear,

280
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:29,108
sit on the sofa.

281
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,668
And I will be there.

282
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:36,068
This is a group of people

283
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:39,788
who want to tell you your work is going to live.

284
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:40,988
Oh, is it ?

285
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:43,908
Is my work going to live ?

286
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:46,068
I can't go through with it, Clarissa.

287
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,108
Oh... Why do you say that ?

288
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,708
- I can't. - Why ?

289
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,348
Because I wanted to be a writer, that's all.

290
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:53,308
So ?

291
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:56,148
I wanted to write about it all.

292
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,228
Everything that happens in a moment.

293
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:00,268
The way the flowers looked

294
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:01,988
when you carried them in your arms.

295
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,268
This towel, how it... smells, how it feels.

296
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,388
This thread.

297
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,948
All our feelings,

298
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:09,708
yours and mine.

299
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:10,708
The history of it,

300
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,348
who we once were.

301
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,108
Everything in the world.

302
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:19,508
Everything all mixed up...

303
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,268
like it's all mixed up now.

304
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,788
And I failed.

305
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,667
I failed.

306
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:40,427
No matter what you start with, it ends up being so much less.

307
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,707
Sheer fucking pride...

308
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,307
and stupidity.

309
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:58,947
We want everything, don't we ?

310
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,387
I suppose we do.

311
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:06,507
You kissed me on a beach.

312
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,227
Yeah.

313
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,027
Do you remember...

314
00:23:16,348 --> 00:23:18,507
how many years ago ?

315
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:19,707
Of course.

316
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:22,987
What did you want then ?

317
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,987
Come closer.

318
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:33,467
I'm right here.

319
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,627
Come closer, would you, please ?

320
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:42,947
Take my hand.

321
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:49,427
Would you be angry ?

322
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:53,706
Would I be angry if you didn't show up

323
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:54,986
at the party ?

324
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:58,226
Would you be angry if I died ?

325
00:23:58,307 --> 00:23:59,466
If you died ?

326
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,786
Who is this party for ?

327
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:03,906
What do you mean, who's it for ?

328
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:05,746
What are you asking ? What are you trying to say ?

329
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,466
I'm not trying to say anything.

330
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,586
Mm.

331
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,866
I'm saying...

332
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:14,866
I think I'm only staying alive to satisfy you.

333
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,826
Well...

334
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,466
so that is what we do.

335
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:29,226
That is what people do.

336
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:32,906
They stay alive for each other.

337
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:33,906
And the doctors told you,

338
00:24:33,947 --> 00:24:35,346
you-you don't need to die.

339
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:36,306
They told you that.

340
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,746
You can... live like this for years.

341
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:41,546
Well, exactly.

342
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:45,426
I don't accept this.

343
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:48,266
I don't accept what you say.

344
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:49,266
Oh.

345
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,506
And it's for you to decide, is it ?

346
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:53,946
How long have you been doing that ?

347
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:56,146
How many years ?

348
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,426
Coming to the apartment.

349
00:24:57,507 --> 00:25:00,346
What about your own life ?

350
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:02,946
What about Sally ?

351
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:06,186
Just wait till I die.

352
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,586
Then you'll have to think of yourself.

353
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,786
How are you going to like that ?

354
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,305
Richard...

355
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:25,505
it would be great if you did come to the party,

356
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:27,945
if you felt well enough to come.

357
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,145
Just to let you know,

358
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:32,185
I am making the crab thing.

359
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:35,105
Not that I imagine it makes any difference to you.

360
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:36,745
Of course, it makes a difference.

361
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,985
I love the crab thing.

362
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,905
Clarissa ?

363
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:44,025
Yes ?

364
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,105
I'll be back at 3:30,

365
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:01,585
and I'll help you get dressed.

366
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,785
Wonderful.

367
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:05,825
3:30.

368
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:18,385
Wonderful.

369
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:45,664
It's on this day,

370
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:47,824
this day of all days...

371
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,664
her fate becomes clear to her.

372
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:06,544
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.

373
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,864
Mr. Woolf said I was to come and speak with you.

374
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,184
I've nearly finished, Nelly.

375
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,144
You can tell me in the kitchen.

376
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:15,664
I'll be down very soon.

377
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,504
Hmm.

378
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,824
What happens is, she says she wants something,

379
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,304
and then it turns out she doesn't.

380
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:28,984
Well, she never does, does she ?

381
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:29,984
She never wants anything.

382
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,984
Mm-hmm.

383
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,224
Especially when she's particularly after it.

384
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:34,184
That's a sure sign.

385
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:35,384
I wish I'd been there.

386
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:36,744
I wish you had, too.

387
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:38,904
Did you give her that look ?

388
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:39,984
That sort of look you do ?

389
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:44,184
I said, Madam...

390
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,543
Yes, Nelly, tell me.

391
00:27:52,624 --> 00:27:53,703
How can I help ?

392
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,023
It's about lunch.

393
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,343
I just had to go ahead on my own.

394
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,103
I understand.

395
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:04,703
You chose a pie ?

396
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,423
I chose a lamb pie.

397
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:08,623
That seems suitable.

398
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:12,023
You being so busy with your writing...

399
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:16,343
I had no instructions.

400
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,823
You do remember that my sister is coming

401
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,423
at 4:00 with the children ?

402
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:22,623
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:24,583
I hadn't forgotten.

404
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,103
China tea, I think.

405
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:32,863
And ginger.

406
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:36,903
Ginger, Madam ?

407
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:42,543
I'd like to give the children a treat.

408
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:46,703
We'd have to go to London

409
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:47,663
for ginger, Madam.

410
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,983
I haven't finished this,

411
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,903
and there's the rest of lunch

412
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:52,343
to get ready.

413
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:55,183
The 12:30 train, Nelly, will get you

414
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,743
into London just after 1:00.

415
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,223
If you return on the 2:30,

416
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:00,783
you should be back in Richmond soon after 3:00.

417
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:03,623
Do I miscalculate ?

418
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:05,783
No.

419
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:08,223
Well, then, is something detaining you, Nelly ?

420
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:18,982
I can't think of anything more exhilarating

421
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,142
than a trip to London.

422
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:28,782
- Good morning, Mrs. Woolf. - Good morning.

423
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:31,702
We shall publish no more new authors.

424
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:32,782
I have to tell you,

425
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:34,542
I've discovered ten errors in the first proof.

426
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:36,142
Lucky to have found them then.

427
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:38,782
Passiondale was a...

428
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:39,942
charnel house

429
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:42,542
from which no min returned.

430
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,982
Do you think it's possible that

431
00:29:46,063 --> 00:29:47,662
bad writing actually attracts a higher

432
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:48,542
incidence of error ?

433
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:53,262
If it's all right, I thought I might take a short walk.

434
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:56,102
Not far ?

435
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,582
No. Just for air.

436
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:01,382
Go then.

437
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,462
If I could walk midmorning,

438
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:05,862
I'd be a happy man.

439
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:17,582
She'll die.

440
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:20,942
She's going to die.

441
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,862
That's what's going to happen.

442
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,382
Huh.

443
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:28,981
That's it.

444
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:36,581
She'll kill herself.

445
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,541
She'll kill herself over something

446
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,381
which doesn't seem to matter.

447
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:45,901
Let's think.

448
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,661
You grease the pan, Mommy.

449
00:30:47,742 --> 00:30:49,741
I know you grease the pan, sweet one.

450
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,061
Even Mommy knows that.

451
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:55,661
This is what we're going to do.

452
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:57,821
Flour...

453
00:30:57,902 --> 00:31:00,181
bowl...

454
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:01,341
sifter.

455
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:02,421
Can I do it, Mommy ?

456
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,981
Can you sift the flour ?

457
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:08,061
Yes, you can sift the flour, baby,

458
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:09,781
if that's what makes you happy.

459
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:16,741
Yeah.

460
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:22,541
Isn't it beautiful ?

461
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:25,781
Don't you think it looks like snow ?

462
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:26,741
Hmm ?

463
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:27,701
Okay.

464
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:30,021
Now, the next thing...

465
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,661
The next thing I'm going

466
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,741
to show you... uh, is...

467
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:35,901
we measure out the cups.

468
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,341
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

469
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:40,101
Now, I know. I know it isn't difficult.

470
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,101
It's just that I...

471
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:43,461
I just want to do this for Daddy.

472
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,381
Because it's his birthday ?

473
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,340
That's right.

474
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:47,820
We're baking the cake

475
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:49,740
to show him that we love him.

476
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,260
Otherwise he won't know we love him ?

477
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,460
That's right.

478
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,820
I got all the stuff.

479
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm going right out again.

480
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,740
My God, what a zoo !

481
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:14,420
Why do people have to talk about dry cleaning ?

482
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,540
I mean, what is there to talk about ?

483
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:18,180
I bought you some flowers.

484
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:21,580
Where are you ?

485
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:23,300
In here.

486
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,660
I got someone at work to cover me.

487
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:28,820
I'll be with you all night.

488
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:36,180
Are you all right ?

489
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:38,060
Sure.

490
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:43,540
I guess you saw Richard.

491
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:44,860
That's right.

492
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,180
Well, of course.

493
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:51,100
I bet he said,

494
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:52,740
Oh, by the way, honey, do you mind ?

495
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:53,860
Can I skip the party ?

496
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:57,060
Don't worry.

497
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,700
He always shows up.

498
00:32:58,781 --> 00:32:59,780
Oh, sure.

499
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:00,900
In the end.

500
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:02,660
What, Richard miss an award ?

501
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,780
A chance to talk about his work.

502
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,179
I don't think so.

503
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,299
He'll show up.

504
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,019
You did the seating.

505
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,819
I did.

506
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,619
I don't believe it... Louis Waters.

507
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,859
Is Louis coming ?

508
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,979
Richard's Louis ?

509
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,339
He is.

510
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,339
You put him next to me.

511
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,739
Why do I always have to sit next to the exes ?

512
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,579
Is this some kind of a hint, sweetheart ?

513
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,979
And, anyway, shouldn't the exes have a table

514
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,339
of their own, where they can all ex together

515
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,819
in ex-quisite agony ?

516
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,739
I'm off.

517
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,659
Try not to pass out from excitement.

518
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,379
Clarissa...

519
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,659
it's going to be beautiful.

520
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,739
Thank you.

521
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,579
You're welcome.

522
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,099
Why is everything wrong ?

523
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,619
It didn't work.

524
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,659
Damn it !

525
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,619
It didn't work.

526
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,099
Hey, Scott.

527
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,138
Hi, Mrs. Barlowe.

528
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,298
Mommy, Mommy, there's someone at the door !

529
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,898
Hello ?

530
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,738
Hello ? Laura ?

531
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:54,778
Hi, Kitty.

532
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,938
Hi. Am I interrupting ?

533
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:57,538
Oh, of course not. Come in.

534
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,658
Are you all right ?

535
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:00,218
Why, sure.

536
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:02,338
Hi, Richie.

537
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:03,458
Sit down.

538
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:04,898
I've got coffee on.

539
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:06,658
Um, would you like some ?

540
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:07,778
Please.

541
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,058
Oh, look.

542
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:11,298
You made a cake.

543
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:12,578
I know.

544
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,698
Didn't work.

545
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,258
I thought it was going to work.

546
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,698
I thought it would work better than that.

547
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:20,778
Oh, Laura, I don't understand

548
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:21,858
why you find it so difficult.

549
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:22,898
I don't know either.

550
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,098
Anyone can make a cake.

551
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:25,058
I know.

552
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,138
Everyone can.

553
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,778
It's ridiculously easy.

554
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:30,778
Like, I bet you didn't even grease the pan.

555
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:32,418
I greased the pan.

556
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:33,458
All right.

557
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:34,578
You know, you have

558
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:36,858
other virtues... and Dan loves you so much,

559
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:38,138
he won't even notice.

560
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,218
Whatever you do,

561
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,538
he's going to say it's wonderful.

562
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,818
Well, it's true.

563
00:35:44,738 --> 00:35:46,297
Does Ray have a birthday ?

564
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:49,137
Sure he does.

565
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:50,177
When is it ?

566
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:51,337
September.

567
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:52,777
We go to the country club.

568
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:54,577
We always go to the country club.

569
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:57,377
We drink martinis and spend the day with 50 people.

570
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,937
Ray's got a lot of friends.

571
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:01,297
He does.

572
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:02,857
You both have a lot of friends.

573
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:03,857
You're good at it.

574
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:08,017
How is Ray ?

575
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:09,977
I haven't seen him in a while.

576
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:11,097
Ray's fine.

577
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:12,257
Mmm.

578
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:14,337
These guys are something, aren't they ?

579
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:15,617
You can say that again.

580
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:17,617
They came home from the war.

581
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,817
They deserved it, didn't they ?

582
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:22,057
After what they'd been through.

583
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,777
What... did they deserve ?

584
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:24,977
I don't know.

585
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,977
Us, I guess.

586
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,857
All this.

587
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:32,497
Oh.

588
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:34,417
You're reading a book.

589
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:35,617
Yeah.

590
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:38,737
What's this one about ?

591
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:40,017
Oh, it's about...

592
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,697
this woman who's incredibly...

593
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:45,857
Well, she's a hostess, and she's incredibly confident,

594
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:47,977
and she's going to give a party,

595
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:50,337
and maybe because she's confident,

596
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:53,257
everyone thinks she's fine...

597
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,777
but she isn't.

598
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,096
So.

599
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:07,456
Well.

600
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,576
Kitty, what is it ?

601
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:15,376
Is something wrong ?

602
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:19,296
I, uh... I have to go into the hospital

603
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,496
for a couple of days.

604
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:22,176
Kitty.

605
00:37:23,337 --> 00:37:26,496
Yeah. I have, um...

606
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,696
some kind of... growth, in my uterus,

607
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:31,296
and they're going to go in and take a look.

608
00:37:31,337 --> 00:37:32,256
When ?

609
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:34,536
This afternoon.

610
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:37,856
Well, I need you to feed the dog.

611
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,896
Of course.

612
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:00,456
Is that what you came here to ask ?

613
00:38:03,737 --> 00:38:05,816
What did the doctor say exactly ?

614
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:10,016
Well, it's probably what the trouble's been.

615
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,416
About getting pregnant.

616
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:16,296
The thing is...

617
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,696
I mean, you know,

618
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:20,536
I've been... really happy with Ray.

619
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,175
And now it turns out there was a reason.

620
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,935
There was a reason I couldn't conceive.

621
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:37,855
You're lucky, Laura.

622
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:40,055
I don't think you can call yourself a woman

623
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:41,255
until you're a mother.

624
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:49,375
The joke is...

625
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,175
all my life I could do everything.

626
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,695
I mean, I could do anything, really.

627
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,255
Except the one thing I wanted.

628
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,055
Yes.

629
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:04,335
That's all.

630
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:07,975
Well, at least now they'll be able to deal with it.

631
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,975
That's right. That's what they're doing.

632
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,015
That's right.

633
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:12,415
Mm. I'm not worried.

634
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:14,855
What would be the point of worrying ?

635
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,775
No, it's not in your hands.

636
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,095
But that's it.

637
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:22,455
It's in the hands of some physician I've never even met.

638
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:26,015
Some surgeon who probably drinks more martinis

639
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:27,055
than Ray and...

640
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:28,055
Oh, Kitty.

641
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:30,575
I'm mean, of course I'm worried about Ray.

642
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:31,415
Come here.

643
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:32,655
I'm doing fine.

644
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:33,615
Really.

645
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:34,695
I know. I know you are.

646
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:36,015
I'm more worried about Ray.

647
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:38,175
If anything, he's not good with this stuff.

648
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:40,735
Forget about him, hmm ?

649
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:42,134
Just forget about Ray.

650
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:05,814
You're sweet.

651
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:12,774
You know the routine, right ?

652
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:15,094
Half a can in the evening, and...

653
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:17,214
check the water now and then,

654
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:20,134
and Ray will feed him in the morning.

655
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:27,534
Kitty, you didn't mind ?

656
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:32,414
What ?

657
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:33,414
I didn't mind what ?

658
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:44,814
Do you want me to drive you ?

659
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:51,174
I think I'll feel better if I drive myself.

660
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:57,294
Kitty, it's going to be all right.

661
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,613
Of course it is.

662
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:05,933
Bye.

663
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,173
What ?

664
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,413
What do you want ?

665
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:48,093
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell has arrived.

666
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:52,133
Not due till 4:00.

667
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:55,093
I can't help it. She's here.

668
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:03,453
You look a perfect angel.

669
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,653
Don't let the boys make fun of you.

670
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,253
Fly away, fly.

671
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,893
Virginia.

672
00:42:13,294 --> 00:42:15,853
Leonard thinks it's the end of civilization...

673
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,813
people who are invited at 4:00 and arrive at 2:30.

674
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:21,132
Oh, God.

675
00:42:22,293 --> 00:42:23,532
Barbarians.

676
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:28,252
Well, we finished lunch sooner than we imagined.

677
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:34,492
I've had to send Nelly off to London for sugar ginger.

678
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:37,012
Oh, Virginia.

679
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:41,052
You're not still frightened of the servants, are you ?

680
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:42,372
Come on.

681
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,092
And how are you, sister ?

682
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:49,212
Frantic.

683
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:51,012
It's been ridiculous in London.

684
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:52,892
Ridiculous ? How ?

685
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:56,252
Busy.

686
00:42:57,613 --> 00:42:59,252
Why is busy ridiculous ?

687
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:02,772
I would have invited you to our party,

688
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:03,932
but I knew you wouldn't come.

689
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:05,372
Did you ? How did you know that ?

690
00:43:07,093 --> 00:43:09,252
I thought you never came to town.

691
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:12,932
That's because you no longer ask me.

692
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,332
Are you not forbidden to come ?

693
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:20,892
Do the doctors not forbid it ?

694
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,932
Oh, the doctors.

695
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:26,172
Do you not pay heed to your doctors ?

696
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:29,292
Not when they're a bunch of contemptible Victorians.

697
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,412
So... what are you saying ?

698
00:43:32,773 --> 00:43:34,892
Are you feeling better ?

699
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:37,372
Has this vastness made you stronger ?

700
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:41,211
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even crazy people like to be asked.

701
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,771
Nessa ! Nessa !

702
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:44,731
Nessa ! Nessa !

703
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:46,971
Hello, changelings.

704
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:48,651
What have you got ?

705
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:49,851
What have you found ?

706
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:51,291
We found a bird.

707
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:52,851
Did you ?

708
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:53,851
Yes.

709
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,451
Where did you find that ?

710
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,371
I think it must have fallen from a tree.

711
00:43:57,412 --> 00:43:58,771
Oh, my goodness.

712
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:00,411
Just look at him.

713
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:02,651
We might be able to save him.

714
00:44:02,692 --> 00:44:04,131
Save him ?

715
00:44:04,212 --> 00:44:07,211
I think you have to be careful, Quentin.

716
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,211
There's a time to die,

717
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,531
and it may be the bird's time.

718
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:11,451
Come on, let's pick some grass

719
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:13,011
to make a grave.

720
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:14,971
- Oh, Julian. - I'm just saying.

721
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:16,651
Then at least there'll be a bed for him to die on.

722
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:19,771
Come on, Nessa, let's make a grave.

723
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:22,771
Nessa, come on !

724
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:24,011
Oh...

725
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:25,811
Very well, I'm coming.

726
00:44:25,892 --> 00:44:27,051
Wait for me then.

727
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,611
Angelica, will you be all right ?

728
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:30,651
Stay with your aunt.

729
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:32,771
You're going too fast.

730
00:44:51,252 --> 00:44:52,691
Do you think she'd like roses ?

731
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:02,010
Is it a she ?

732
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:05,770
Yes, the females are larger.

733
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:09,450
And less colorful.

734
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:12,170
What happens when we die ?

735
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,930
What happens ?

736
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:22,130
We return to the place that we came from.

737
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:24,970
I don't remember where I came from.

738
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:26,450
Nor do I.

739
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,010
She looks very small.

740
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:36,090
Yes.

741
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:38,650
Yes, that's one of the things that happens...

742
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:42,130
we look smaller.

743
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:45,330
But very peaceful.

744
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,770
Oh, is it done ?

745
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:00,970
Have we finished ?

746
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,890
Is the bird funeral complete ?

747
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:03,850
Yes.

748
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,210
Very well, then.

749
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:08,010
Are we to be denied tea altogether for coming so early ?

750
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:09,410
No, of course not.

751
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:10,570
Good.

752
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:13,570
Come on, Angelica.

753
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:14,890
Come on, come on, boys.

754
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:15,929
Let's get some tea.

755
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,849
Nessa, tell him to stop it !

756
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,049
Now stop it, Julian.

757
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,609
Virginia, we're going in.

758
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,809
Virginia !

759
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:48,008
Hey, bug.

760
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:50,128
I've got this idea.

761
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:52,488
We're going to make another cake.

762
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:55,928
We're going to make a better one.

763
00:47:55,969 --> 00:47:57,448
What happened to the first one ?

764
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:04,328
And after that...

765
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:06,968
I think we should go out.

766
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:18,528
Yes ?

767
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:20,688
Clarissa, it's Louis.

768
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,168
Louis Waters.

769
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:24,968
Louis ? Oh, my God.

770
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:25,928
You're early.

771
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:26,928
Do you mind ?

772
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:28,528
Is it all right ?

773
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:48,208
Oh, why should I mind ?

774
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:49,328
I'm delighted !

775
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:50,888
Well, now !

776
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:55,527
I feel like I'm interrupting.

777
00:48:55,608 --> 00:48:56,487
Oh, why ?!

778
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:57,927
No.

779
00:48:58,008 --> 00:48:59,727
I know the ceremony isn't until 5:00,

780
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:01,007
but I flew in this morning.

781
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:06,167
Oh, well, Richard's going to be thrilled.

782
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,607
He'll be thrilled to see you.

783
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:09,607
You think so ?

784
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:11,127
Of course.

785
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,527
What are we doing ? We should go in.

786
00:49:27,608 --> 00:49:28,967
Are you all right ?

787
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:30,607
Yes. It's nothing.

788
00:49:30,688 --> 00:49:32,407
It's just the party.

789
00:49:32,488 --> 00:49:33,927
Oh, right.

790
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:38,527
Oh, wow !

791
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:39,487
It's looking beautiful.

792
00:49:39,568 --> 00:49:41,167
Thanks.

793
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:41,927
Are you still with... ?

794
00:49:42,008 --> 00:49:42,927
Yes, I am.

795
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:44,847
Still with her. Ten years.

796
00:49:45,968 --> 00:49:46,727
It's crazy.

797
00:49:46,808 --> 00:49:48,767
Why is it crazy ?

798
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:50,447
No reason.

799
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:51,967
Would you like something to drink ?

800
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:53,607
Some water.

801
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:54,487
Okay.

802
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:11,767
Are you still an editor ?

803
00:50:11,848 --> 00:50:13,967
Oh, sure.

804
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:15,326
With the same publisher ?

805
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:17,926
Mm-hmm.

806
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:19,766
How's San Francisco ?

807
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:23,726
Oh, it's one of those cities people tell you to like.

808
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:39,646
Richard said he thought

809
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:40,726
you were happy out there.

810
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:41,686
Oh, great.

811
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,646
So now the illness makes him psychic.

812
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:47,926
You have to prepare yourself, Louis.

813
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:50,206
He's very changed.

814
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:54,246
I read the book.

815
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:55,446
Oh, God...

816
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:57,366
Exactly.

817
00:50:57,447 --> 00:50:59,126
I thought you were meant to do more

818
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,726
than just change people's names.

819
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,726
Well...

820
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:03,926
Isn't it meant to be fiction ?

821
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:05,606
He even had you living

822
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,126
on 10th Street.

823
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:08,206
It isn't me.

824
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:09,286
Isn't it ?

825
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,526
You know how Richard is.

826
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:11,566
It's a fantasy.

827
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:13,046
A whole chapter on

828
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:15,766
Should she buy some nail polish ?

829
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:17,086
And then, guess what ?

830
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,126
After 50 pages, she doesn't.

831
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:23,126
The whole thing seems to go on for eternity.

832
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:24,086
Nothing happens.

833
00:51:24,127 --> 00:51:25,046
And then, wham !

834
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,446
For no reason, she kills herself.

835
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:28,726
His mother

836
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:29,806
kills herself.

837
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:31,446
Yeah, sure, his mother, but still for no reason.

838
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:33,685
Well, I...

839
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:34,725
Out of the blue.

840
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:38,325
I know the book is tough, but I liked it.

841
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:40,405
I know.

842
00:51:40,526 --> 00:51:43,805
Only one thing upset me.

843
00:51:43,886 --> 00:51:45,045
What's that ?

844
00:51:45,086 --> 00:51:46,005
What upset you ?

845
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:49,405
Well...

846
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:52,285
that there wasn't more about you.

847
00:51:56,886 --> 00:51:58,485
That's kind.

848
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,005
I went back to Wellfleet.

849
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,205
You did ?

850
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:08,165
One day.

851
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:09,285
I didn't tell you ?

852
00:52:11,646 --> 00:52:13,005
No.

853
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:15,005
But then, I never see you.

854
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:18,165
You remember the house.

855
00:52:18,206 --> 00:52:20,685
It's still there.

856
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:21,725
I think you're courageous.

857
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,525
Courageous ? Why ?

858
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:26,285
To dare go visit.

859
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:28,485
What I mean is...

860
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:30,285
to face the fact

861
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:34,645
that we have lost those feelings forever.

862
00:52:37,526 --> 00:52:38,845
Shit !

863
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:40,725
Clarissa ?

864
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:42,925
Um...

865
00:52:42,966 --> 00:52:44,925
I don't know what's happening.

866
00:52:45,006 --> 00:52:45,885
I'm sorry.

867
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:47,325
I seem to be in some strange

868
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:48,845
sort of mood.

869
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:49,845
I'm sorry.

870
00:52:49,886 --> 00:52:52,685
It's, uh, it's very rude of me.

871
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:56,964
I seem to be unraveling.

872
00:52:57,045 --> 00:52:57,964
I shouldn't have come.

873
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:59,004
No, it's not you.

874
00:52:59,125 --> 00:52:59,844
It's not you.

875
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,764
It's more like having a presentiment.

876
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:04,324
Do you know what I'm saying ?

877
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,404
Oh, God, it's probably just nerves

878
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,364
about the party, you know ?

879
00:53:10,445 --> 00:53:12,844
Bad hostess !

880
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:15,444
Clarissa, what's happened ?

881
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:17,204
Jesus !

882
00:53:17,245 --> 00:53:19,524
What is it ?!

883
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:20,964
Oh ! Oh, God !

884
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:25,804
Do you want me to go ?

885
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:29,444
No, don't go ! Don't...

886
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:31,204
Don't go.

887
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:33,044
Explain to me why this is happening.

888
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:37,404
Don't... don't touch me.

889
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:38,644
Jesus.

890
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,764
It's better if you don't.

891
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:46,364
It's just too much.

892
00:53:46,445 --> 00:53:49,204
You fly in from San Francisco,

893
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:52,044
and I've been nursing Richard for years.

894
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:55,044
And all the time, I've held myself together...

895
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,524
no problem.

896
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:58,004
I know.

897
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:03,844
One morning, in Wellfleet...

898
00:54:03,925 --> 00:54:08,164
you were there, we were all there...

899
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,644
I'd been sleeping with him,

900
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:13,683
and I was out on the back porch.

901
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:17,483
He came out behind me,

902
00:54:17,564 --> 00:54:22,203
and he put his hand on my shoulder.

903
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:24,923
Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.

904
00:54:28,484 --> 00:54:30,043
That's...

905
00:54:32,164 --> 00:54:33,763
That's when...

906
00:54:33,844 --> 00:54:36,523
From then on, I've... been stuck.

907
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:37,603
Stuck ?

908
00:54:37,684 --> 00:54:39,763
Yep.

909
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,163
Yeah.

910
00:54:43,284 --> 00:54:45,083
With the name, I mean.

911
00:54:48,724 --> 00:54:51,083
And now you walk in.

912
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:54,243
To see you

913
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:57,643
walk in... because I never see you.

914
00:54:57,724 --> 00:55:00,043
Look at you.

915
00:55:02,004 --> 00:55:06,323
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

916
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:08,243
It was you he stayed with.

917
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:09,243
It was you he lived with.

918
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:12,283
I had one summer.

919
00:55:23,364 --> 00:55:25,643
The day I left him,

920
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:32,083
I got on a train and made my way across Europe.

921
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:36,562
I felt free for the first time in years.

922
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:55,402
So... tell me about San Francisco.

923
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:56,682
What's to tell ?

924
00:55:56,723 --> 00:56:00,242
I still teach drama to idiots, mostly.

925
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:01,802
They can't all be idiots.

926
00:56:01,843 --> 00:56:03,962
No, no. In fact,

927
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:06,922
I shouldn't tell you this, but...

928
00:56:07,003 --> 00:56:08,122
I've fallen in love.

929
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,242
Really ?

930
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:12,322
Yes.

931
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:14,242
With a student.

932
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:15,402
With a student.

933
00:56:15,483 --> 00:56:17,082
Exactly.

934
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:19,002
I know.

935
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,362
You think, Am I still up for this ?

936
00:56:21,483 --> 00:56:23,282
All this intensity, all those arguments,

937
00:56:23,403 --> 00:56:26,042
doors being slammed.

938
00:56:26,123 --> 00:56:28,922
Well, you know what it's like.

939
00:56:30,123 --> 00:56:31,362
Are you feeling better ?

940
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,562
A little.

941
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:36,122
Thank you.

942
00:56:40,243 --> 00:56:41,962
You think I'm ridiculous ?

943
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:46,202
Ridiculous ?

944
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:48,802
Fortunate, too.

945
00:57:17,682 --> 00:57:20,041
I'm going to leave you at Mrs. Latch's.

946
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:21,961
I have to do something.

947
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:35,201
Mommy, I don't want to go.

948
00:57:35,282 --> 00:57:37,321
You have to. I'm sorry.

949
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:39,481
I have something to do before Daddy gets home.

950
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:27,080
Hello.

951
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:28,600
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

952
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:30,240
My boy's not very happy.

953
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:33,480
Mommy, I don't want to do this.

954
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:35,920
I have to go, honey.

955
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:39,360
Your mommy has things she has to do.

956
00:58:39,441 --> 00:58:40,840
Come in, I got cookies.

957
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:43,120
Okay, baby ?

958
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,560
You have to be brave now.

959
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:48,960
Don't worry now.

960
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,360
It's going to be fine.

961
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:51,360
Well...

962
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:09,320
Honey !

963
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,879
Come on. Come on, darling.

964
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,519
Mommy !

965
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,479
- Stop it. - No !

966
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,719
Darling, stop it.

967
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,839
Mommy !

968
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,959
- All right. - Mommy !

969
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,839
Mommy !

970
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,199
Mommy !

971
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,159
Come on.

972
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,599
Mommy !

973
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,119
Mommy !

974
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,839
No !

975
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,198
Breakfast is served

976
01:01:29,279 --> 01:01:31,118
between 7:00 and 11:00 in the Regency Room,

977
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:32,398
and room service is available

978
01:01:32,479 --> 01:01:33,958
24 hours.

979
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:37,158
Thank you, ma'am.

980
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:40,718
Is there anything else you need ?

981
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:43,358
Yes, um...

982
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:45,278
No.

983
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:46,918
Not to be disturbed.

984
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:01,517
'Did it matter, then ? ' She asked herself,

985
01:03:01,598 --> 01:03:03,917
walking toward Bon Street.

986
01:03:03,998 --> 01:03:09,077
Did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely ?

987
01:03:09,158 --> 01:03:12,717
All this must go on without her.

988
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:15,837
Did she resent it ?

989
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,757
Or did it not become consoling

990
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,597
to believe that death ended absolutely ?

991
01:03:23,677 --> 01:03:27,956
It is possible to die.

992
01:03:29,717 --> 01:03:31,236
It is possible...

993
01:03:31,317 --> 01:03:32,676
...to die.

994
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:38,636
There was a lovely coat for Angelica at Harrod's,

995
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:40,156
then nothing for the boys.

996
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:41,316
It seems so unfair.

997
01:03:41,397 --> 01:03:42,916
Why should Angelica be favored ?

998
01:03:46,117 --> 01:03:47,316
Virginia ?

999
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:51,596
Virginia ?

1000
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:53,036
Virginia !

1001
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,036
What are you thinking about ?

1002
01:04:08,717 --> 01:04:11,676
Are you still with us ?

1003
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:26,436
Your aunt's a very lucky woman, Angelica...

1004
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:28,876
because she has two lives.

1005
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:31,276
She has the life she's leading,

1006
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:33,836
and also the book she's writing.

1007
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:37,996
This makes her very fortunate indeed.

1008
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:40,036
What were you thinking about ?

1009
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:10,035
I was going to kill my heroine...

1010
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:13,435
but I've changed my mind.

1011
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:17,475
I... I can't.

1012
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:33,955
I fear I may have to kill someone else instead.

1013
01:05:41,276 --> 01:05:42,795
Oh, Quentin !

1014
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:45,115
We're ready !

1015
01:05:46,716 --> 01:05:48,235
A fascinating visit.

1016
01:05:48,316 --> 01:05:51,475
We enjoyed it thoroughly.

1017
01:05:52,556 --> 01:05:53,755
Do you have to go already ?

1018
01:05:55,436 --> 01:05:56,635
I do wish you wouldn't go.

1019
01:05:56,716 --> 01:05:57,595
Oh, Virginia,

1020
01:05:57,676 --> 01:06:00,395
the last thing you want is our noisiness.

1021
01:06:00,476 --> 01:06:03,915
My hopeless, clumsy boys.

1022
01:06:03,995 --> 01:06:05,754
Say good-bye, boys.

1023
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:08,114
Bye !

1024
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:11,554
You'll return to what ?

1025
01:06:11,595 --> 01:06:12,994
Tonight ?

1026
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:18,234
Oh, just some... insufferable dinner.

1027
01:06:18,315 --> 01:06:21,154
Not even you could envy, Virginia.

1028
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:22,634
But I do.

1029
01:06:58,155 --> 01:06:59,394
Say something, Nessa.

1030
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:01,034
Didn't you think I seemed better ?

1031
01:07:01,195 --> 01:07:03,354
Yes...

1032
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:06,754
Yes... Virginia, you seemed better.

1033
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,473
You think...

1034
01:07:22,634 --> 01:07:25,793
You think I may one day escape ?

1035
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,953
One day. One...

1036
01:07:30,594 --> 01:07:31,513
Nessa.

1037
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:35,073
Nessa !

1038
01:07:35,114 --> 01:07:36,673
Come on, Nessa.

1039
01:07:36,714 --> 01:07:38,273
Come, Angelica, we must go.

1040
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:41,673
Come on !

1041
01:07:41,714 --> 01:07:42,633
Good-bye.

1042
01:07:42,674 --> 01:07:44,673
Good-bye, little girl.

1043
01:07:44,754 --> 01:07:47,353
Angelica !

1044
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:48,753
The train !

1045
01:07:50,794 --> 01:07:53,473
We're going to miss the train.

1046
01:07:53,514 --> 01:07:54,953
Come on. Hurry up.

1047
01:07:55,034 --> 01:07:55,953
Big step.

1048
01:08:01,114 --> 01:08:02,593
Come on, come on, come on !

1049
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:04,193
I want to go home.

1050
01:08:04,234 --> 01:08:05,153
Yeah, all right.

1051
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:07,513
We stayed too long, we've missed the train.

1052
01:08:07,594 --> 01:08:09,673
Stay close.

1053
01:09:29,673 --> 01:09:31,152
I'm sorry, I know.

1054
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,552
I tried to get here earlier.

1055
01:09:32,593 --> 01:09:34,112
I tried, okay ? Don't start.

1056
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:35,952
I know,

1057
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:39,632
it's just incredibly important because it's your party.

1058
01:09:39,713 --> 01:09:42,192
Julia, how have you been doing ?

1059
01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:44,672
I'm fine.

1060
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:45,512
Come here.

1061
01:09:45,553 --> 01:09:48,272
What have you been doing ?

1062
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:50,632
Well, studying, Mom.

1063
01:09:54,393 --> 01:09:55,432
Um...

1064
01:09:55,513 --> 01:09:58,352
So, what should I do ? Chairs ?

1065
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:00,591
No. Let's clear off the desk first.

1066
01:10:00,672 --> 01:10:03,471
You can take it into the bedroom.

1067
01:10:03,552 --> 01:10:05,831
I bumped into Louis Waters.

1068
01:10:05,872 --> 01:10:07,111
Oh, you did ?

1069
01:10:07,152 --> 01:10:08,311
Where ?

1070
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:09,271
In the street.

1071
01:10:12,232 --> 01:10:13,671
They're all here, aren't they ?

1072
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:14,751
All the ghosts.

1073
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:18,471
All of the ghosts are assembling for the party.

1074
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:21,191
He's so weird.

1075
01:10:21,232 --> 01:10:23,631
Oh, what ?

1076
01:10:23,712 --> 01:10:24,951
You can't see that ?

1077
01:10:25,032 --> 01:10:27,391
You can't see that Louis Waters is weird ?

1078
01:10:30,112 --> 01:10:31,991
I can see that he's sad.

1079
01:10:32,072 --> 01:10:36,311
Well... all your friends are sad.

1080
01:10:38,552 --> 01:10:40,271
You've been crying. What's happening ?

1081
01:10:44,272 --> 01:10:46,351
All it is, I looked around this room,

1082
01:10:46,432 --> 01:10:49,151
and I thought, I'm giving a party.

1083
01:10:49,192 --> 01:10:51,711
All I want to do is give a party.

1084
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:52,991
And ?

1085
01:10:53,032 --> 01:10:55,751
I know why he does it ; he does it deliberately.

1086
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:58,671
Oh, is this Richard ?

1087
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:00,191
Of course.

1088
01:11:00,232 --> 01:11:01,951
He did it this morning.

1089
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:03,911
He gives me that look.

1090
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:05,351
What look ?

1091
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:08,871
To say...

1092
01:11:08,912 --> 01:11:12,591
Your life is... trivial.

1093
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:16,511
You are so trivial.

1094
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,911
Just...

1095
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:20,430
daily stuff, you know.

1096
01:11:20,511 --> 01:11:22,790
Schedules and parties and... details.

1097
01:11:22,871 --> 01:11:26,510
That's what he means... by it, that is what he's saying.

1098
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:28,670
Mom, it only matters if you think it's true.

1099
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:31,870
Well ?

1100
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:33,790
Do you ? Tell me.

1101
01:11:36,551 --> 01:11:38,830
When I'm with him, I feel...

1102
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:45,070
Yes, I am living.

1103
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:50,150
And when I'm not with him...

1104
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:52,710
Yes, everything does seem sort of s...

1105
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:54,990
...silly.

1106
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:01,630
I don't mean with you.

1107
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:02,870
Oh, I...

1108
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,590
God. Jesus.

1109
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:08,750
Never with you.

1110
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:09,870
It's all the rest of it.

1111
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:16,150
Sally ?

1112
01:12:17,351 --> 01:12:19,110
The rest of it.

1113
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:25,950
False comfort.

1114
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:27,470
Because ?

1115
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:30,470
If you say to me, When were you happiest ?

1116
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:31,630
Mom...

1117
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:34,110
Tell me the moment you were happiest.

1118
01:12:34,191 --> 01:12:37,230
I know, I know, it was years ago.

1119
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:40,229
Yeah.

1120
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:44,669
All you're saying is... you were once young.

1121
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,109
I remember one morning...

1122
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,149
getting up at dawn,

1123
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:59,349
there was such a sense of possibility.

1124
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,269
You know ? That feeling ?

1125
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,349
Hmm ?

1126
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:04,669
And I remember thinking to myself,

1127
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:07,509
So, this is the beginning of happiness.

1128
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,309
This is where it starts.

1129
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,349
And, of course, there will always be more.

1130
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,149
It never occurred to me

1131
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:21,149
it wasn't the beginning.

1132
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:25,949
It was happiness.

1133
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:31,469
It was the moment...

1134
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,669
right then.

1135
01:14:55,269 --> 01:14:57,068
Ah, Nelly, good evening. I was wondering

1136
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:58,228
if you'd seen Mrs. Woolf.

1137
01:14:58,309 --> 01:15:00,188
I thought you knew, sir.

1138
01:15:00,269 --> 01:15:02,188
Mrs. Woolf has gone out.

1139
01:15:37,468 --> 01:15:38,827
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

1140
01:16:04,788 --> 01:16:06,987
Mr. Woolf, what an unexpected pleasure.

1141
01:16:07,068 --> 01:16:08,507
Perhaps you could tell me

1142
01:16:08,588 --> 01:16:10,667
exactly what you think you're doing ?

1143
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,027
What I was doing ?

1144
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:13,347
I went to look for you, and you weren't there.

1145
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:15,867
You were working in the garden. I didn't wish to disturb you.

1146
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:17,587
You disturb me when you disappear.

1147
01:16:17,668 --> 01:16:18,587
I didn't disappear.

1148
01:16:20,468 --> 01:16:21,707
I went for a walk.

1149
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,267
A walk ?! Is that all ?

1150
01:16:23,348 --> 01:16:24,907
Just a walk ?

1151
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:28,667
Virginia, we must go home now. Nelly's cooking dinner.

1152
01:16:28,748 --> 01:16:31,067
She's already had a very difficult day.

1153
01:16:31,188 --> 01:16:32,827
It's just our obligation to eat Nelly's dinner.

1154
01:16:32,908 --> 01:16:35,147
There is no such obligation.

1155
01:16:35,227 --> 01:16:37,426
No such obligation exists.

1156
01:16:37,507 --> 01:16:38,466
Virginia,

1157
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:40,026
you have an obligation to your own sanity.

1158
01:16:40,107 --> 01:16:42,106
I have endured this custody !

1159
01:16:42,187 --> 01:16:44,506
I have endured this imprisonment.

1160
01:16:44,627 --> 01:16:45,826
Oh, Virginia !

1161
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:48,506
I am attended by doctors, everywhere.

1162
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:50,346
I am attended by doctors

1163
01:16:50,427 --> 01:16:52,906
who inform me of my own interests !

1164
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:54,106
They know your interests.

1165
01:16:54,187 --> 01:16:55,146
They do not !

1166
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:56,986
They do not speak for my interests.

1167
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:58,306
Virginia, I can...

1168
01:16:58,387 --> 01:17:00,666
I can see that it must be hard for a woman of your...

1169
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:02,506
- Of what ? Of my what, exactly ? - Uh, your...

1170
01:17:02,547 --> 01:17:03,586
your talents to see

1171
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,506
that she may not be the best judge

1172
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,706
of her own condition !

1173
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:08,706
Who, then, is a better judge ?

1174
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:09,986
You have a history !

1175
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,306
You have a history of confinement.

1176
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:14,786
We brought you to Richmond

1177
01:17:14,867 --> 01:17:17,746
because you have a history of fits, moods, blackouts,

1178
01:17:17,827 --> 01:17:19,266
hearing voices.

1179
01:17:19,347 --> 01:17:21,226
We brought you here

1180
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:22,666
to save you from the irrevocable damage

1181
01:17:22,707 --> 01:17:25,786
you intended upon yourself.

1182
01:17:25,867 --> 01:17:28,426
You've tried to kill yourself twice !

1183
01:17:32,187 --> 01:17:33,586
I live daily with that threat.

1184
01:17:33,667 --> 01:17:36,026
I set up the press... we set up the printing press

1185
01:17:36,107 --> 01:17:38,066
not just for itself,

1186
01:17:38,147 --> 01:17:41,306
not just purely for itself, but so that you might have

1187
01:17:41,387 --> 01:17:44,666
a ready source of absorption and of remedy.

1188
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:45,906
Like needlework ?

1189
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:49,066
It was done for you !

1190
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:51,306
It was done for your betterment !

1191
01:17:51,387 --> 01:17:53,346
It was done out of love !

1192
01:17:55,146 --> 01:17:58,785
If I didn't know you better, I'd call this ingratitude.

1193
01:17:58,866 --> 01:18:01,705
I am ungrateful ?

1194
01:18:01,786 --> 01:18:03,865
You call me ungrateful ?

1195
01:18:05,586 --> 01:18:08,985
My life has been stolen from me.

1196
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:14,505
I'm living in a town I have no wish to live in.

1197
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:19,025
I'm living... a life I have no wish to live.

1198
01:18:22,826 --> 01:18:25,505
How did this happen ?

1199
01:18:38,066 --> 01:18:41,305
It is time for us to move back to London.

1200
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:48,745
I miss London.

1201
01:18:48,786 --> 01:18:51,745
I miss London life.

1202
01:18:54,346 --> 01:18:56,305
This is not you speaking, Virginia.

1203
01:18:56,386 --> 01:18:57,785
This is an aspect of your illness.

1204
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,745
- It's not you. - It is me. It is my voice.

1205
01:18:59,866 --> 01:19:00,825
It's not your voice.

1206
01:19:00,906 --> 01:19:02,065
It's mine and mine alone.

1207
01:19:02,146 --> 01:19:03,505
This is the voice that you hear.

1208
01:19:03,586 --> 01:19:06,185
It is not ! It is mine !

1209
01:19:06,226 --> 01:19:08,145
I'm dying in this town !

1210
01:19:12,145 --> 01:19:14,024
If you were thinking clearly, Virginia,

1211
01:19:14,065 --> 01:19:15,344
you'd recall it was London

1212
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:17,024
that brought you low.

1213
01:19:17,105 --> 01:19:19,864
If I were thinking clearly...

1214
01:19:20,945 --> 01:19:23,584
If I were thinking clearly...

1215
01:19:23,665 --> 01:19:26,264
We brought you to Richmond to give you peace.

1216
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:29,064
If I were thinking clearly, Leonard,

1217
01:19:29,105 --> 01:19:32,944
I would tell you that I wrestle alone in the dark,

1218
01:19:33,025 --> 01:19:36,104
in the deep dark, and that only I can know,

1219
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:39,064
only I can understand my own condition.

1220
01:19:40,385 --> 01:19:41,904
You live with the threat... you tell me...

1221
01:19:42,065 --> 01:19:43,784
you live with the threat of my extinction.

1222
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:47,264
Leonard, I live with it,

1223
01:19:47,345 --> 01:19:48,784
too.

1224
01:19:52,305 --> 01:19:54,824
This is my right.

1225
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:57,064
It is the right of every human being.

1226
01:19:57,145 --> 01:20:00,544
I choose not the suffocating anesthetic of the suburbs,

1227
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,784
but the violent jolt of the capital.

1228
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:04,544
That is my choice.

1229
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:07,064
The meanest patient,

1230
01:20:07,145 --> 01:20:09,664
yes, even the very lowest is allowed some say

1231
01:20:09,745 --> 01:20:12,264
in the matter of her own prescription.

1232
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:14,584
Thereby she defines her humanity.

1233
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,704
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,

1234
01:20:25,745 --> 01:20:31,104
I could be happy in this quietness.

1235
01:20:31,184 --> 01:20:36,303
But if it is a choice between Richmond and death,

1236
01:20:36,384 --> 01:20:38,023
I choose death.

1237
01:20:48,304 --> 01:20:50,343
Very well, London, then.

1238
01:20:51,704 --> 01:20:53,823
We'll go back to London.

1239
01:21:27,104 --> 01:21:29,943
You hungry ?

1240
01:21:34,544 --> 01:21:36,543
I'm a little hungry myself.

1241
01:21:55,503 --> 01:21:58,462
Come along.

1242
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:00,542
London train on platform one !

1243
01:22:00,623 --> 01:22:04,622
This is the London train terminating at Vauxhall.

1244
01:22:08,943 --> 01:22:13,462
You cannot find peace by avoiding life, Leonard.

1245
01:22:21,223 --> 01:22:23,142
This is the London train !

1246
01:22:24,503 --> 01:22:28,142
London train on platform one !

1247
01:22:43,103 --> 01:22:45,422
Mommy !

1248
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:48,062
Mommy !

1249
01:22:57,423 --> 01:22:59,062
Hey. Hey, there, bug.

1250
01:22:59,143 --> 01:23:01,062
Hey, what's wrong ?

1251
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,822
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

1252
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:03,942
Sorry I'm late.

1253
01:23:04,023 --> 01:23:05,022
He's fine.

1254
01:23:05,103 --> 01:23:06,022
He's been fine.

1255
01:23:06,063 --> 01:23:07,502
He's, he's just happy to see you.

1256
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,782
Aw, it couldn't have been that bad, could it ? Hmm ?

1257
01:23:09,862 --> 01:23:11,461
So, you got it cut, then ?

1258
01:23:11,502 --> 01:23:13,341
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.

1259
01:23:13,382 --> 01:23:14,261
Looks great.

1260
01:23:14,342 --> 01:23:15,701
Well, they didn't have to do very much.

1261
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:17,381
Well, we had a fine time

1262
01:23:17,422 --> 01:23:18,701
together.

1263
01:23:19,782 --> 01:23:21,661
Thank you very much.

1264
01:23:25,782 --> 01:23:29,461
So, that wasn't too bad, was it ?

1265
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:31,021
I wasn't gone too long.

1266
01:23:31,102 --> 01:23:33,101
No, you weren't long.

1267
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:34,901
That's right.

1268
01:23:37,582 --> 01:23:40,261
At one point...

1269
01:23:40,302 --> 01:23:42,221
I don't know.

1270
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:49,581
There was a moment where I thought I might be longer.

1271
01:23:49,662 --> 01:23:51,381
But I changed my mind.

1272
01:23:58,862 --> 01:23:59,781
What is it, honey ?

1273
01:23:59,822 --> 01:24:03,221
Mommy, I love you.

1274
01:24:05,342 --> 01:24:07,341
I love you, too, baby.

1275
01:24:15,502 --> 01:24:17,221
What's wrong ?

1276
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:21,861
What ?

1277
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:30,660
Don't worry, honey, everything's fine.

1278
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:33,380
We're going to have a wonderful party,

1279
01:24:33,421 --> 01:24:37,100
and we've made your daddy such a nice cake.

1280
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,020
I love you, sweetheart.

1281
01:24:45,261 --> 01:24:47,460
You're my guy.

1282
01:25:22,741 --> 01:25:25,180
Mommy !

1283
01:25:25,261 --> 01:25:27,500
Mommy !

1284
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:24,539
Richard, it's me. I'm early.

1285
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,979
What the hell is going on ?

1286
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:32,859
Richard !

1287
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,939
What are you doing here ? You're early !

1288
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:40,179
Wha-What is going on here ?

1289
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,819
What are you doing ?

1290
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,619
I-I had this wonderful idea.

1291
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:46,819
I needed some light. I needed to let in some light !

1292
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,459
Richard, what are you doing ?

1293
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,779
I had this fantastic notion.

1294
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,979
I took the Xanax and the Ritalin together.

1295
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,459
It-it never occurred to me.

1296
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,139
Richard...

1297
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,259
Don't come near me !

1298
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:07,379
It seemed to me I needed to let in some light.

1299
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:12,978
What do you think ? I cleared away all the windows.

1300
01:27:13,059 --> 01:27:15,538
All right, Richard, do me one simple favor.

1301
01:27:15,659 --> 01:27:16,698
Come. Come sit.

1302
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:19,578
I don't think I can make it to the party, Clarissa.

1303
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:20,698
You don't have to go to the party.

1304
01:27:20,779 --> 01:27:21,978
You don't have to go to the ceremony.

1305
01:27:22,019 --> 01:27:23,618
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

1306
01:27:23,659 --> 01:27:25,138
You can do as you like.

1307
01:27:25,259 --> 01:27:28,098
But I still have to face the hours, don't I ?

1308
01:27:28,179 --> 01:27:30,178
I mean, the hours after the party,

1309
01:27:30,259 --> 01:27:32,418
and the hours after that...

1310
01:27:32,459 --> 01:27:35,418
You do have good days still.

1311
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,178
You know you do.

1312
01:27:37,259 --> 01:27:39,458
Not really.

1313
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:40,858
I mean, it's kind of you to say so, but it's...

1314
01:27:40,859 --> 01:27:42,298
I mean, it's kind of you to say so, but it's...

1315
01:27:42,339 --> 01:27:43,618
not really true.

1316
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:52,978
Are they here ?

1317
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:54,738
Who ?

1318
01:27:54,819 --> 01:27:55,538
The voices.

1319
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:58,338
Oh, the voices are always here.

1320
01:27:58,379 --> 01:28:01,978
And it's the voices that you're hearing now, isn't it ?

1321
01:28:02,059 --> 01:28:03,698
No, no, no, no.

1322
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,018
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

1323
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:14,898
I've stayed alive for you,

1324
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:16,738
but now you have to let me go.

1325
01:28:18,499 --> 01:28:19,418
Richard, I...

1326
01:28:19,499 --> 01:28:20,458
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1327
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:22,698
Wait.

1328
01:28:26,378 --> 01:28:27,297
Tell me a story.

1329
01:28:27,338 --> 01:28:28,897
What about ?

1330
01:28:28,978 --> 01:28:32,737
Tell me a story from your day.

1331
01:28:32,818 --> 01:28:33,737
I, um...

1332
01:28:33,818 --> 01:28:35,657
I-I got up...

1333
01:28:35,738 --> 01:28:37,297
Yes ?

1334
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:43,577
...and I went out, and, uh, I went to buy flowers,

1335
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,457
Like Mrs. Dalloway, in the book, you know ?

1336
01:28:45,538 --> 01:28:46,857
Yes.

1337
01:28:46,938 --> 01:28:47,937
And it was a beautiful morning.

1338
01:28:48,018 --> 01:28:49,417
Was it ?

1339
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:51,417
Yes, it was so beautiful.

1340
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:53,097
It was so fresh.

1341
01:28:53,178 --> 01:28:54,817
Oh, fresh, was it ?

1342
01:28:54,898 --> 01:28:55,857
Yes.

1343
01:28:59,538 --> 01:29:00,057
Like a...

1344
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:02,777
like a morning on the beach ?

1345
01:29:02,818 --> 01:29:04,337
Yes.

1346
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:05,457
Like that ?

1347
01:29:05,538 --> 01:29:07,297
Yes.

1348
01:29:07,338 --> 01:29:11,097
Like that morning when you walked out of that old house,

1349
01:29:11,178 --> 01:29:14,217
and you were, you were 18, and maybe I was 19.

1350
01:29:14,298 --> 01:29:16,017
Yes.

1351
01:29:16,098 --> 01:29:18,137
I was 19 years old,

1352
01:29:18,178 --> 01:29:22,577
and I'd never seen anything so beautiful.

1353
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:24,617
You...

1354
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:26,497
coming out of a glass door

1355
01:29:26,538 --> 01:29:28,977
in the early morning, still sleepy.

1356
01:29:29,058 --> 01:29:31,737
Isn't it strange ?

1357
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:37,457
Most ordinary morning in anybody's life.

1358
01:29:39,898 --> 01:29:42,777
I'm afraid I can't make it to the party, Clarissa.

1359
01:29:42,858 --> 01:29:46,137
The party...

1360
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:48,136
doesn't matter.

1361
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:51,536
You've been so good to me, Mrs. Dalloway.

1362
01:29:53,697 --> 01:29:55,696
I love you.

1363
01:30:00,697 --> 01:30:02,096
I don't think two people

1364
01:30:02,177 --> 01:30:04,456
could've been happier than we've been.

1365
01:30:12,097 --> 01:30:13,136
Oh, God, no !

1366
01:30:21,937 --> 01:30:23,896
Happy birthday.

1367
01:30:23,977 --> 01:30:25,216
Happy birthday, Dan.

1368
01:30:25,257 --> 01:30:26,496
This is perfect.

1369
01:30:26,577 --> 01:30:28,256
This is just perfect.

1370
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:30,416
Oh, do you think so ?

1371
01:30:30,497 --> 01:30:31,536
Do you really think so ?

1372
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:32,496
Why, sure.

1373
01:30:32,577 --> 01:30:34,296
You must've been working all day.

1374
01:30:34,337 --> 01:30:35,976
Well, that's what we were doing.

1375
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,616
Weren't we, bug ?

1376
01:30:37,697 --> 01:30:39,776
Been working all day.

1377
01:30:39,817 --> 01:30:40,936
This is just fantastic.

1378
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:42,456
It's what I've always wanted.

1379
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,216
Oh, Dan.

1380
01:30:44,297 --> 01:30:45,576
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.

1381
01:30:45,657 --> 01:30:47,296
I'll tell you how it all happened.

1382
01:30:47,337 --> 01:30:49,216
Don't.

1383
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:50,336
I want to.

1384
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:53,216
I want to tell him the story.

1385
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:54,216
What happened...

1386
01:30:54,297 --> 01:30:55,816
when I was in the war.

1387
01:30:55,897 --> 01:30:58,296
At war, I found myself

1388
01:30:58,337 --> 01:31:00,456
thinking about this girl that I had seen...

1389
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:01,856
I had never met her...

1390
01:31:01,937 --> 01:31:03,176
at high school,

1391
01:31:03,256 --> 01:31:04,695
this... strange,

1392
01:31:04,776 --> 01:31:08,655
fragile-looking girl named Laura McGrath.

1393
01:31:12,016 --> 01:31:13,255
Yeah.

1394
01:31:13,336 --> 01:31:14,335
And she was shy...

1395
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:17,855
and she was interesting.

1396
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:20,215
And... well, your mother won't mind if

1397
01:31:20,256 --> 01:31:21,175
I tell you this, Richie.

1398
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,695
She was the sort of girl that you see

1399
01:31:22,776 --> 01:31:23,775
sitting mostly on her own.

1400
01:31:23,856 --> 01:31:25,495
And I'll tell you...

1401
01:31:25,576 --> 01:31:27,975
sometimes, when I was in the South Pacific,

1402
01:31:28,056 --> 01:31:29,655
the fact is

1403
01:31:29,696 --> 01:31:30,975
that I used to think

1404
01:31:31,056 --> 01:31:32,535
about this girl.

1405
01:31:32,656 --> 01:31:33,535
Dan.

1406
01:31:33,616 --> 01:31:34,975
I used to think

1407
01:31:35,016 --> 01:31:36,895
about bringing her to a house,

1408
01:31:36,936 --> 01:31:39,135
to a life.

1409
01:31:40,336 --> 01:31:42,175
Pretty much like this.

1410
01:31:43,856 --> 01:31:46,295
And it was the thought of the happiness...

1411
01:31:47,896 --> 01:31:51,175
the thought of this woman,

1412
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,295
the thought of this life...

1413
01:31:52,376 --> 01:31:54,055
that's what kept me going.

1414
01:31:55,496 --> 01:31:57,855
I had an idea of our happiness.

1415
01:32:24,735 --> 01:32:26,574
Why does someone have to die ?

1416
01:32:30,735 --> 01:32:31,974
Leonard...

1417
01:32:32,055 --> 01:32:33,694
In your book, you said someone had to die.

1418
01:32:33,775 --> 01:32:34,654
Hmm.

1419
01:32:34,735 --> 01:32:36,734
Why ?

1420
01:32:38,335 --> 01:32:41,134
Is that a stupid question ?

1421
01:32:41,215 --> 01:32:42,494
No.

1422
01:32:42,575 --> 01:32:43,854
I imagine my question is stupid.

1423
01:32:45,615 --> 01:32:47,494
Not at all.

1424
01:32:48,815 --> 01:32:50,014
Well ?

1425
01:32:52,655 --> 01:32:54,534
Someone has to die

1426
01:32:54,615 --> 01:32:57,174
in order that the rest of us should value life more.

1427
01:32:59,215 --> 01:33:01,054
It's contrast.

1428
01:33:01,135 --> 01:33:03,214
And who will die ?

1429
01:33:04,975 --> 01:33:06,494
Tell me.

1430
01:33:09,095 --> 01:33:12,054
The poet will die.

1431
01:33:12,095 --> 01:33:14,694
The visionary.

1432
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:29,534
What are you doing ?

1433
01:33:29,655 --> 01:33:31,774
I'm brushing my teeth.

1434
01:33:35,975 --> 01:33:37,854
Are you coming to bed ?

1435
01:33:37,935 --> 01:33:40,374
Yeah, in a minute.

1436
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:44,573
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

1437
01:33:48,894 --> 01:33:50,333
I ran into Ray.

1438
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:52,293
He said Kitty had to go to the hospital.

1439
01:33:53,854 --> 01:33:55,773
I know.

1440
01:33:55,854 --> 01:33:57,053
Nothing serious.

1441
01:33:57,094 --> 01:33:59,213
He said just a checkup.

1442
01:34:00,734 --> 01:34:02,653
I'm terrified.

1443
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:04,693
Why ?

1444
01:34:06,894 --> 01:34:09,213
Only I knew that she could disappear.

1445
01:34:11,134 --> 01:34:12,253
Maybe you could

1446
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:14,013
go see her in the morning, honey.

1447
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,013
I was going to.

1448
01:34:23,094 --> 01:34:25,693
I was going to stop by.

1449
01:34:25,734 --> 01:34:28,413
I've had a wonderful day,

1450
01:34:28,494 --> 01:34:30,893
and I have you to thank.

1451
01:34:36,214 --> 01:34:40,413
Come to bed, honey.

1452
01:34:40,454 --> 01:34:42,453
I'm coming.

1453
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:53,573
Are you coming ?

1454
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,493
Yes.

1455
01:35:13,253 --> 01:35:15,212
What ?

1456
01:35:18,173 --> 01:35:20,332
I was hoping you were going to bed.

1457
01:35:20,413 --> 01:35:22,412
I am.

1458
01:35:22,493 --> 01:35:24,372
I am going to bed.

1459
01:35:26,693 --> 01:35:28,572
What, then ?

1460
01:35:30,693 --> 01:35:33,732
All else is clear.

1461
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:36,412
The outline of the story is planned,

1462
01:35:36,493 --> 01:35:38,212
now one thing only.

1463
01:35:38,293 --> 01:35:41,052
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny must be resolved.

1464
01:36:20,812 --> 01:36:23,491
You're Laura Brown.

1465
01:36:23,572 --> 01:36:28,211
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.

1466
01:36:30,172 --> 01:36:32,211
Of course.

1467
01:36:34,212 --> 01:36:35,651
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.

1468
01:36:35,732 --> 01:36:37,451
Please come in.

1469
01:36:45,972 --> 01:36:48,731
My friend Sally is in the kitchen,

1470
01:36:48,812 --> 01:36:51,051
and my daughter.

1471
01:36:51,132 --> 01:36:52,891
I'll take this.

1472
01:36:53,012 --> 01:36:55,771
We were having a party.

1473
01:36:55,812 --> 01:36:59,011
We were going to have a party.

1474
01:36:59,092 --> 01:37:00,251
I was lucky.

1475
01:37:00,332 --> 01:37:02,011
I got the last plane from Toronto.

1476
01:37:02,052 --> 01:37:06,451
So, that's the monster.

1477
01:37:06,532 --> 01:37:08,611
Hope I did the right thing.

1478
01:37:08,692 --> 01:37:10,571
I found your number in his phone book.

1479
01:37:10,652 --> 01:37:14,851
Yes, he had it.

1480
01:37:14,932 --> 01:37:17,331
We didn't speak often.

1481
01:37:28,732 --> 01:37:31,971
It's a terrible thing, Miss Vaughan... to outlive

1482
01:37:32,052 --> 01:37:33,611
your whole family.

1483
01:37:37,012 --> 01:37:39,411
Richard's father died.

1484
01:37:39,491 --> 01:37:42,770
Yes, he-he died of cancer quite young.

1485
01:37:42,811 --> 01:37:44,650
And Richard's sister is dead.

1486
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:53,130
Obviously, you... feel unworthy.

1487
01:37:53,211 --> 01:37:57,970
Gives you feelings of unworthiness.

1488
01:37:58,051 --> 01:38:01,090
You survive and they don't.

1489
01:38:05,331 --> 01:38:07,450
Have you read the poems ?

1490
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:09,930
Oh, yes. Oh...

1491
01:38:11,531 --> 01:38:13,490
I also read the novel.

1492
01:38:20,891 --> 01:38:25,770
You see, uh, people say the novel is difficult.

1493
01:38:25,851 --> 01:38:29,370
Uh... I know.

1494
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,250
They say that.

1495
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:38,450
I know.

1496
01:38:40,611 --> 01:38:43,130
He had me die in the novel.

1497
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:45,770
I-I-I know why he did that.

1498
01:38:50,531 --> 01:38:51,570
It hurt, of course.

1499
01:38:51,611 --> 01:38:53,850
I can't pretend it didn't hurt, but I...

1500
01:38:53,891 --> 01:38:57,250
I know why he did it.

1501
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:03,849
You left Richard when he was a child.

1502
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:09,689
I left both my children.

1503
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:12,329
I abandoned them.

1504
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:21,569
They say it's the worst thing a mother can do.

1505
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,729
You have a daughter.

1506
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:41,649
Yes...

1507
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:44,529
But I never met Julia's father.

1508
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:46,689
You so wanted a child.

1509
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,969
That's right.

1510
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:53,889
You're a lucky woman.

1511
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:05,329
There are times when you don't belong,

1512
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:08,329
and you think you're going to kill yourself.

1513
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:16,689
Once, I went to a hotel.

1514
01:40:20,289 --> 01:40:23,768
Later that night, I made a plan.

1515
01:40:23,849 --> 01:40:26,208
The plan was I would leave my family

1516
01:40:26,289 --> 01:40:30,328
when my second child was born...

1517
01:40:30,369 --> 01:40:32,768
and that's what I did.

1518
01:40:32,849 --> 01:40:36,448
I got up one morning,

1519
01:40:36,529 --> 01:40:38,928
made breakfast,

1520
01:40:39,009 --> 01:40:42,328
went to the bus stop,

1521
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:45,448
got on a bus.

1522
01:40:45,529 --> 01:40:47,688
I'd left a note.

1523
01:40:51,809 --> 01:40:56,368
I got a job in a library in Canada.

1524
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:04,528
It would...

1525
01:41:06,489 --> 01:41:10,208
be wonderful to say you regretted it.

1526
01:41:10,289 --> 01:41:12,208
It would be easy.

1527
01:41:17,169 --> 01:41:19,808
But what does it mean ?

1528
01:41:19,889 --> 01:41:23,728
What does it mean to regret...

1529
01:41:23,809 --> 01:41:26,568
when you have no choice ?

1530
01:41:36,568 --> 01:41:38,887
It's what you can bear.

1531
01:41:44,488 --> 01:41:46,327
There it is.

1532
01:41:46,448 --> 01:41:48,687
No one's going to forgive me.

1533
01:41:54,728 --> 01:41:58,687
It was death.

1534
01:41:58,768 --> 01:42:01,367
I chose life.

1535
01:42:58,687 --> 01:43:01,206
Time to take your coat off.

1536
01:43:43,367 --> 01:43:45,326
I thought you might like a cup of tea.

1537
01:43:45,367 --> 01:43:47,006
Oh my goodness.

1538
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:48,846
Thank you, dear.

1539
01:43:48,887 --> 01:43:50,926
I feel like I'm stealing your room.

1540
01:43:52,887 --> 01:43:53,846
Um, we put the food away,

1541
01:43:53,967 --> 01:43:55,686
so, if you're at all hungry in the night,

1542
01:43:55,767 --> 01:43:56,846
just help yourself.

1543
01:43:56,887 --> 01:43:58,046
Oh, I will.

1544
01:43:58,127 --> 01:44:00,166
Where will you sleep ?

1545
01:44:00,247 --> 01:44:01,486
Oh, the sofa.

1546
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:03,366
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1547
01:44:11,087 --> 01:44:13,246
Good night, sweetheart.

1548
01:44:14,446 --> 01:44:16,325
Good night.

1549
01:44:35,286 --> 01:44:37,285
Dear Leonard,

1550
01:44:37,366 --> 01:44:42,325
to look life in the face...

1551
01:44:42,406 --> 01:44:48,405
always to look life in the face,

1552
01:44:48,446 --> 01:44:53,685
and to know it for what it is.

1553
01:44:53,766 --> 01:44:59,085
At last, to know it,

1554
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:02,685
to love it for what it is,

1555
01:45:02,766 --> 01:45:06,245
and then...

1556
01:45:06,326 --> 01:45:08,925
to put it away.

1557
01:45:12,526 --> 01:45:15,725
Leonard...

1558
01:45:15,766 --> 01:45:20,205
always the years between us,

1559
01:45:20,246 --> 01:45:23,845
always the years...

1560
01:45:23,926 --> 01:45:29,045
always... the love...

1561
01:45:29,086 --> 01:45:32,245
always...

1562
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,645
the hours.
