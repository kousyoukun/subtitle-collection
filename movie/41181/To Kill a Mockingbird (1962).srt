1
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:03,274
Maycomb was a tired old town...

2
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:06,152
even in 1932, when l first knew  it.

3
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:09,545
Somehow it was hotter then.

4
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:14,065
Men's stiff collars
wilted by 9:00 in the morning.

5
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:18,864
Ladies bathed before noon,
and after their 3:00 naps...

6
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:21,309
...by nightfall
were like soft tea cakes...

7
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,988
with frostin's of sweat
and sweet talcum.

8
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:29,383
A day was 24 hours long,
but it seemed longer.

9
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:34,111
There was no hurry, for there was
nowhere to go and nothing to buy...

10
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,832
no money to buy it with...

11
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:37,905
although Maycomb County
had recently been told...

12
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:40,349
that it had nothing to fear
but fear itself.

13
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:44,787
That summer l was six years old.

14
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:48,310
- Good morning, Mr Cunningham.
- Mornin', miss.

15
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,148
My daddy's getting dressed.
Would you like me to call him for you?

16
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:55,943
- No, miss. I don't care to bother.
- Why, it's no bother, Mr Cunningham.

17
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,343
He'll be happy to see you!
Atticus!

18
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,831
Here's Mr Cunningham.

19
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:09,592
- Good morning, Walter.
- Mornin', Mr Finch.

20
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:12,063
I didn't want to bother you none.

21
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,032
I brung you these here hickory nuts
as part of my entailment.

22
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:18,868
Well, l thank you. The collards
we had last week were delicious.

23
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,184
- Well, mornin'.
- Morning.

24
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,465
Scout, l think maybe...

25
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:32,467
next time Mr Cunningham comes,
you better not call me.

26
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:35,830
- I thought you'd wanna thank him.
- I do.

27
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:38,223
I think it embarrasses him
to be thanked.

28
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:45,705
Why does he bring you
all this stuff?

29
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:48,149
He's payin' me
for some legal work l did for him.

30
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:51,226
- Why does he pay you like this?
- That's the only way he can.

31
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:52,667
He has no money.

32
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,631
- Is he poor?
- Yes.

33
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:01,427
- Are we poor?
- We are indeed.

34
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,187
Are we as poor
as the Cunninghams?

35
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:08,062
No, not exactly. Cunninghams
are country folks, farmers.

36
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:11,391
Crash hit them the hardest.

37
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:17,874
- Scout, call your brother.
- Atticus. Jem's up in the tree.

38
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:19,785
He says he won't come down
until you agree...

39
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:22,468
to play football
for the Methodists.

40
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,985
Jem.

41
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:33,553
Son, why don't you come on down out
of there now and have your breakfast?

42
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,148
Calpurnia has a good one.
Hot biscuits.

43
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:39,909
No, sir! Not until you agree
to play football for the Methodists.

44
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:44,590
Oh, son, l can't do that. I explained
to you l'm too old to get out there.

45
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:47,188
After all,
l'm the only father you have.

46
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,947
Wouldn't want me to go out there
and get my head knocked off, would you?

47
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,433
I ain't comin' down!

48
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:54,625
Suit yourself.

49
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:01,110
Mornin'.

50
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,709
- Morning, Miss Maudie.
- What's goin' on over there?

51
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:08,469
I'm havin' a terrible time.
Jem's stayin' up in the tree...

52
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:11,352
until Atticus agrees
to play football for the Methodists.

53
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:14,747
And Atticus says he's too old.

54
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,712
Every time l'm wantin'
to do somethin', he's too old!

55
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:22,470
- He's too old for anything!
- He can do plenty of things.

56
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:25,512
You be good, children.
Mind Cal.

57
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:29,153
- Mornin', Maudie.
- Mornin', Atticus.

58
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,464
He won't let me have a gun...

59
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:34,990
and he'll only play touch football
with me-- never tackle.

60
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:40,505
He can make somebody's will
so airtight, you can't break it.

61
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:43,870
You count your blessin's
and stop complainin'. Both of you.

62
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:46,912
Thank your stars
he has the sense to act his age.

63
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,511
-Jem, he is pretty old.
- I can't help that.

64
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,785
Hey.

65
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:04,546
- Hey yourself.
- I'm Charles Baker Harris. I can read.

66
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,992
You got anything needs readin',
l can do it.

67
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:10,793
How old are you?
Four and a half?

68
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:14,071
- Goin' on seven.
- No wonder then.

69
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:16,190
Scout's been readin'
since she was born...

70
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:19,232
and she don't start school
till next month.

71
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,589
You look right puny
for goin' on seven.

72
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,505
I'm little, but l'm old.

73
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:28,707
Folks call me Dill.
I'm from Meridian, Mississippi...

74
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:32,628
and l'm spendin' two weeks next door
with my Aunt Stephanie.

75
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:35,069
My mama works
for a photographer in Meridian.

76
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,748
She entered my picture
in the "Beautiful Child" contest...

77
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,143
and won five dollars on me.

78
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:44,147
She give the money to me, and l went
to the picture show 20 times with it.

79
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:48,910
Our mama's dead, but we got a daddy.
Where's your daddy?

80
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,590
I haven't got one.

81
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,983
- Is he dead?
- No.

82
00:07:56,394 --> 00:08:00,148
If he's not dead,
you've got one. Haven't you?

83
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,830
Hush, Scout.

84
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,711
What did l do?

85
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:15,026
- Dill, this is Calpurnia.
- Pleased to know you, Dill.

86
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:16,991
Pleased to know you.

87
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:19,144
My daddy owns the L&N railroad.

88
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:22,544
He's gonna let me run the engine
all the way to New Orleans.

89
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,511
Is that so?

90
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,863
He says l can invite anybody--

91
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:36,629
There goes the meanest man
that ever took a breath of life.

92
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,587
Why is he the meanest man?

93
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:45,108
Well, for one thing...

94
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,349
he has a boy named Boo...

95
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,426
that he keeps chained to a bed
in the house over yonder.

96
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,471
Come on.

97
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,548
See? He lives over there.

98
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:08,230
Boo only comes out at night
when you're asleep and it's pitch-dark.

99
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,464
When you wake up at night,
you can hear him.

100
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:13,227
Once l heard him scratchin'
on our screen door...

101
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:16,465
but he was gone
by the time Atticus got there.

102
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,704
Wonder what he does in there.

103
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:23,783
- Wonder what he looks like.
- Well...

104
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:28,827
judgin' from his tracks,
he's about six and a half feet tall.

105
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:32,987
He eats raw squirrels
and all the cats he can catch.

106
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:37,431
There's a long, jagged scar
that runs all the way across his face.

107
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:40,631
His teeth are yellow and rotten,
his eyes are popped...

108
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,545
and he drools most of the time.

109
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,669
I don't believe you.

110
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:50,064
- Dill, what are you doin' here?
- My Lord, Aunt Stephanie!

111
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:54,033
- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- I don't want you playing there.

112
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:56,184
There's a maniac lives there,
and he's dangerous.

113
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,627
See?

114
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,547
I was just tryin' to warn him about Boo,
but he wouldn't believe me.

115
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,750
You just better believe him,
Mr Dill Harris.

116
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,870
Tell him how Boo
tried to kill his papa.

117
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,912
I was standin' in my yard one day
when his mama come out yellin'...

118
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:09,347
"He's killin' us all!"

119
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,790
Turned out that Boo was cuttin' up
the paper for his scrapbook...

120
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:15,513
and when his daddy come by,
he reached over with his scissors...

121
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:18,631
stabbed him in his leg, pulled them out
and went right on cuttin' the paper.

122
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:21,547
They wanted to send him to an asylum,
but his daddy said...

123
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,784
"No Radley's goin' to any asylum."

124
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,149
So they locked him up
in the basement of the courthouse...

125
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,749
till he nearly died of the damp,
and his daddy brought him back home.

126
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:33,588
There he is to this day,
sittin' over there with his scissors.

127
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,904
Lord knows what
he's doin' or thinkin'.

128
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:43,066
Six, seven, eight...

129
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:45,588
nine, ten!

130
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:51,431
Come on, Scout! lt's 5:00!

131
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:59,145
- Where you goin'?
- Time to meet Atticus.

132
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:02,226
- Why do you call your daddy Atticus?
- 'Cause Jem does.

133
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,305
- Why does he?
- I don't know.

134
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,227
He just started to
ever since he began talking.

135
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:15,232
Wait. Stop.
Miss Dubose is on her porch.

136
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:18,704
Listen, no matter what she says to you,
don't answer her back.

137
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,433
There's a Confederate pistol
in her lap under her shawl...

138
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,823
and she'll kill you
quick as look at you.

139
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,791
Come on.

140
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:36,664
- Hey, Miss Dubose.
- Don't say "Hey" to me, you ugly girl!

141
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:39,905
You say,
"Good afternoon, Miss Dubose."

142
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:42,428
You come over here
when l'm talkin' to you!

143
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:45,472
You come over here, l said!

144
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,351
- You listen to me when l'm talkin'!
- Atticus, this is Dill.

145
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:50,312
- How do you do, Dill?
- Don't your daddy teach you respect?

146
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:53,670
You come back here,
Jean Louise Finch!

147
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,465
Good afternoon, Miss Dubose.

148
00:11:57,554 --> 00:12:01,103
My, you look like a picture
this afternoon.

149
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:03,469
He don't say a picture of what.

150
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:06,273
My goodness gracious,
look at your flowers.

151
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,232
Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

152
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:13,193
Miss Dubose, the gardens at Bellingrath
have nothing to compare...

153
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,583
with your flowers.

154
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:18,108
Well, l don't think
they're as nice as last year.

155
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:21,630
He gets her interested in something nice
so she forgets bein' mean.

156
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:24,945
I think that your yard is gonna be
the show place of this town.

157
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:28,549
Well, grand seein' you,
Miss Dubose.

158
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:46,194
"l had two cats
which l brought ashore...

159
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,471
on my first raft.

160
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:53,183
And l had a dog."

161
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:57,506
Do you think Boo Radley
ever really comes...

162
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:00,233
and looks in my window at night?

163
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:03,511
Jem says he does. This afternoon
when we were over by their house--

164
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:09,032
Scout, l told you and Jem
to leave those poor people alone.

165
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:13,669
I want you to stay away from their house
and stop tormentin' them.

166
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,791
- Yes, sir.
- That's all the readin' for tonight.

167
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:19,547
- It's gettin' late.
- What time is it?

168
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,422
- 8:30.
- May l see your watch?

169
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:44,551
"To Atticus,
my beloved husband."

170
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:49,666
Jem says this watch
is gonna belong to him someday.

171
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:52,473
- That's right.
- Why?

172
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:58,629
Well, it's customary for the boy
to have his father's watch.

173
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:02,031
What are you gonna give me?

174
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,743
Well...

175
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,031
I don't know that l have much else
of value that belongs to me.

176
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,227
But there's a pearl necklace.

177
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,226
There's a ring
that belonged to your mother.

178
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:20,145
And l put them away...

179
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,794
and they're to be yours.

180
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,385
- Good night, Scout.
- Good night.

181
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,105
- Good night,Jem.
- Good night.

182
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,151
Yes?

183
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:07,870
- How old was l when Mama died?
- Two.

184
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,513
- How old were you?
- Six.

185
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:15,114
Old as l am now?

186
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:20,387
Was Mama pretty?

187
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,070
Was Mama nice?

188
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:31,351
- Did you love her?
- Yes.

189
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:35,029
- Did l love her?
- Yes.

190
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,543
Do you miss her?

191
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:53,271
- Evenin', Atticus.
- Good evening, Judge.

192
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,792
Rather warm, isn't it?

193
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,151
Yes, indeed.

194
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:09,544
- How's Mrs Taylor?
- She's fine. Fine, thank you.

195
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,793
Atticus, you heard
about Tom Robinson.

196
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,746
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,943
Grand jury will get around
to chargin' him tomorrow.

198
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:32,707
I was thinking about appointing you
to take his case.

199
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:39,750
Now, l realize you're very busy
these days with your practice.

200
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,067
And your children
need a great deal of your time.

201
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,703
Yes, sir.

202
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,193
I'll take the case.

203
00:16:56,954 --> 00:17:00,185
I'll send a boy over for you tomorrow
when his hearing comes up.

204
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:07,586
- Well, l'll see you tomorrow, Atticus.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:14,589
- And thank you.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,066
Hey, Jem...

207
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:29,703
I bet you a "Grey Ghost"
against two "Tom Swifts"...

208
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:32,752
you wouldn't go any farther
than Boo Radley's gate.

209
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,189
- Scared to, ain't you?
- I ain't scared.

210
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:43,664
I go past Boo Radley's house
nearly every day of my life.

211
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:46,552
- Always running.
- You hush up, Scout.

212
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:53,104
- Come on, Dill!
- Me first!

213
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:57,393
- You gotta let Dill be first.
- No, me!

214
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,351
Let her be first.

215
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,345
All right. Get in!

216
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,232
- Hurry up!
- All right.

217
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,502
- You ready?
- Uh-huh. Let her go.

218
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:31,592
Get away from there!
Scout, come on!

219
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,950
Don't just lie there! Get up!

220
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:40,705
Come on!

221
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:50,633
Run for your life!
Come on, Dill!

222
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,543
Now who's the coward?
You tell them about this...

223
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:04,910
back in Meridian County,
Mr Dill Harris.

224
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:08,032
I'll tell you what let's do.

225
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,868
Let's go down to the courthouse, and
see the room that they locked Boo up in.

226
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:15,503
My aunt says it's bat-infested,
and he nearly died from the mildew.

227
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:18,950
Come on! l bet they got chains
and instruments of torture down there.

228
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,151
Come on!

229
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:26,904
-Jem Finch?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:19:26,994 --> 00:19:30,225
If you're lookin' for your daddy,
he's inside the courthouse.

231
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:33,306
- Thank you, sir, but we're not look--
- Thank you, Mr Townsend, sir.

232
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:37,783
What's your daddy doin'
in the courthouse?

233
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:40,547
He's a lawyer,
and he has a case.

234
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,943
The grand jury's chargin'
his client today.

235
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:45,946
I heard somethin' about it last night
when Judge Taylor came over.

236
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,992
- Let's go watch!
- No, Dill!

237
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:50,951
He wouldn't like that.

238
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,865
Wait a minute!

239
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,270
- Is that the courtroom?
- Yeah.

240
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,551
I can't see anything.

241
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:14,944
You all lift me up
so l can see what's goin' on.

242
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:17,343
All right. Make a saddle.

243
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,145
Not much is happenin'.

244
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:28,153
The judge looks like he's asleep.

245
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,831
I see your daddy
and a coloured man.

246
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,144
The coloured man--

247
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,828
The coloured man looks to me
like he's cryin'.

248
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:42,384
- I seen him with my Mayella.
- I wonder what he's done to cry about?

249
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,112
What's goin' on?

250
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:49,026
There's a whole lot of men
sittin' together on one side...

251
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,709
and one man keeps pointin'
at the coloured man and yellin'.

252
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:57,143
- They're takin' the coloured man away.
- Where's Atticus?

253
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:01,669
I can't see your daddy now either.

254
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,148
- I wonder where in the world--
- Scout, Jem.

255
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,308
What in the world
are you doin' here?

256
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,828
Hello, Atticus.

257
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,109
What are you doin' here?

258
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:19,664
We came down to find out
where Boo Radley was locked up.

259
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,949
We wanted to see the bats.

260
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:25,422
I want you all back home
right away.

261
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:27,584
- Yes, sir.
- Run along now.

262
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,943
I'll see you there for dinner.

263
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,748
Hey, howdy, Cap'n.

264
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,427
- Mr Ewell.
- Cap'n, l--

265
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,712
I'm real sorry they picked you to defend
that nigger that raped my Mayella.

266
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:55,184
I don't know why l didn't kill him
myself instead of goin' to the sheriff.

267
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,425
I'd have saved you and the sheriff
and the taxpayers lots of trouble.

268
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:01,267
- Excuse me, Mr Ewell. I'm very busy.
- Hey, Captain...

269
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:04,630
somebody told me just now...

270
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:08,832
they thought that you believed
Tom Robinson's story agin ours.

271
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:12,423
You know what l said?

272
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,153
I said, "You wrong, man.
You dead wrong!

273
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,032
Mr Finch ain't takin'
his story against ours."

274
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:24,303
- They was wrong, wasn't they?
- I'm appointed to defend Tom Robinson.

275
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:28,182
Now that he's been charged,
that's what l intend to do.

276
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:31,107
- You takin' his story--
- If you'll excuse me.

277
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:38,386
What kind of man are you?

278
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:40,351
You got children of your own.

279
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:02,227
I think we ought to stay right here
in Miss Stephanie's yard.

280
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,226
You don't have to come along,
Angel May.

281
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:21,471
What are you gonna do?

282
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:25,263
Gonna look in a window
at the Radley house...

283
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,709
and see if we can
get a look at Boo Radley!

284
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:30,466
Come on.

285
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:37,187
- Please. I'm scared.
- Then go home if you're scared!

286
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:39,424
I swear, you act more
like a girl all the time.

287
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:41,505
- Come on.
- Wait for me. I'm coming.

288
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:50,105
We'll go around back...

289
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:53,027
and crawl under the high wire fence
at the rear of the Radley lot.

290
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,543
I don't believe
we can be seen from there.

291
00:24:06,594 --> 00:24:08,425
Come on.

292
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:23,591
Come on.

293
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,505
Come on.

294
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,665
Hold it up for me.

295
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,747
Don't make a sound.

296
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:00,903
Spit on it.

297
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:06,705
All right.

298
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:14,463
Spit some more.

299
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,185
All right.

300
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:44,384
Come on.

301
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,672
Come on. Hurry!

302
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:37,345
Hurry!

303
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,745
Quick! Come on!

304
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:28,945
Quiet!

305
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,067
- What are you gonna do for pants?
- I don't know.

306
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:45,151
You come on in now.

307
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:49,031
I better go.

308
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,669
Coming, Aunt Stephanie!

309
00:28:52,754 --> 00:28:54,870
So long.
I'll see you next summer.

310
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:56,751
So long!

311
00:28:58,114 --> 00:28:59,752
I'm comin'!

312
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:04,344
- I'm goin' back after my pants.
- Please, Jem. Come on in the house.

313
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:07,028
I can't go in without my pants.

314
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,912
- Then l'm goin' to call Atticus.
- No, you're not.

315
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:12,952
Now listen. Atticus ain't never
whipped me since l can remember...

316
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:15,673
and l plan to keep it that way.

317
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,588
- Then l'm goin' with you.
- You ain't! Now you stay right here.

318
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,983
I'll be back
before you can count to ten.

319
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:34,787
One, two...

320
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:38,991
three, four--

321
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,745
Come on in.

322
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,067
Five...

323
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:51,989
six, seven, eight...

324
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,312
nine, ten...

325
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:01,873
11 , 12...

326
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:06,027
13, 14--

327
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:27,551
What was that? What is it?

328
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,511
What happened?

329
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:34,073
What's goin' on? What is it?

330
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:36,625
What is it?

331
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:39,353
Will somebody please tell me
what's goin' on?

332
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:45,272
Mr Radley shot at a prowler
out in his collard patch.

333
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:47,424
A prowler? Oh, Maudie!

334
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,108
Whoever it was
won't be back anytime soon.

335
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:52,105
Mr Radley must have scared them
out of their wits.

336
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:54,025
Well, good night.

337
00:30:54,794 --> 00:30:56,944
Scared the livin' daylights
out of me.

338
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,947
Come on now. The excitement's over.
Time for bed.

339
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:29,225
Mornin'.

340
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,108
- Good morning, Miss Maudie.
- Good morning, Calpurnia.

341
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:35,503
Came to see if Jean Louise
is ready for her first day at school.

342
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,154
- Hey, Jem. Y'all ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

343
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:44,029
What are you gonna do with your self
with both children at school?

344
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,833
I don't know,
and that's the truth.

345
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:49,223
I was thinkin' about that just now.

346
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,382
Did you hear me? Now hurry!

347
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:12,908
Hey, everybody.
Look at Scout!

348
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:20,391
Come on in here.

349
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,505
Have your breakfast.

350
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,104
I think your dress
is mighty becomin', honey.

351
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:38,913
Now don't go tuggin' at that dress.

352
00:32:38,994 --> 00:32:41,827
You wanna have it all wrinkled
before you even get to school?

353
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:47,187
I still don't see why
l have to wear a darn old dress.

354
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:49,344
- You'll get used to it.
- I'm ready!

355
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:56,351
It's half an hour
before school starts.

356
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:59,663
Sit back down
and wait for your sister.

357
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:07,911
- Hurry up!
- I'm tryin' to.

358
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:11,464
Come on! lt's your first day.
You wanna be late?

359
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:16,542
- I'm ready.
- Let's go!

360
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:22,305
Bye!

361
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,665
Darn you, Walter Cunningham!

362
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:54,425
Cut that out!

363
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,869
What do you think you're doin'?

364
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:01,829
He made me start off
on the wrong foot!

365
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,109
I was tryin' to explain
to that darn lady teacher...

366
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:07,948
why he didn't have no money
for his lunch, and she got sore at me!

367
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,231
Stop it!

368
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,067
Your daddy Mr Walter Cunningham
from Old Sarum?

369
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:28,946
Come home and have dinner with us.
We'd be glad to have you.

370
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:33,824
Our daddy is a friend
of your daddy's.

371
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:39,067
Scout here is crazy.
She won't fight you no more.

372
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:45,666
I hope that's a dinner
that you enjoy.

373
00:34:45,754 --> 00:34:48,985
Yes, sir. I don't know when
l've had a roast.

374
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:52,544
We've been having squirrels
and rabbits lately.

375
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:57,902
My pa and l go hunting
in our spare time.

376
00:34:57,994 --> 00:35:00,428
You got a gun of your own?

377
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,990
- How long you had a gun?
- A year or so.

378
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:10,072
- Can l have the syrup, please?
- Certainly, son.

379
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,265
Will you bring in
the syrup dish, please?

380
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:15,424
Yes, sir.

381
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,869
How old were you
when you got your first gun?

382
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,751
Thirteen or fourteen.

383
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:26,225
I remember when my daddy
gave me that gun.

384
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:29,793
He told me that l should never
point at anything in the house...

385
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,552
and that he'd rather
l shoot at tin cans in the backyard.

386
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:39,546
But he said that soon the temptation
to go after birds would be too much...

387
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,831
and that l could shoot
all the bluejays l wanted...

388
00:35:44,914 --> 00:35:46,905
if l could hit 'em.

389
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:50,111
But to remember it was a sin
to kill a mockingbird.

390
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:52,705
Why?

391
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:55,991
I reckon 'cause mockingbirds
don't do anything...

392
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:58,383
but make music for us to enjoy.

393
00:36:01,114 --> 00:36:05,153
Don't eat people's gardens.
Don't nest in the corn cribs.

394
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:09,709
They don't do one thing
but just sing their hearts out for us.

395
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,672
How'd you like school?

396
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,551
All right.

397
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:19,623
Thank you, Cal.
That's for Walter.

398
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:43,628
What in the sam hill
are you doin'--

399
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:46,831
But Atticus, he's gone
and drowned his dinner in syrup...

400
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:49,553
and now he's pourin' it
all over.

401
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:53,873
- What?
- Come out here. I wanna talk to you.

402
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,385
That boy is your company...

403
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:08,023
and if he wants to eat up
that tablecloth, you let him, you hear?

404
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:09,945
And if you can't act fit
to eat like folks...

405
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:12,343
you can just sit here
and eat in the kitchen.

406
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,864
What in the world
has got into you?

407
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:34,865
- Now, now.
- I'm not goin' back.

408
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:41,263
I'm not goin' back
to school anymore.

409
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:43,788
Now, Scout.
It's just the first day.

410
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:46,946
I don't care.
Everything went wrong.

411
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,468
The teacher got mad
as the devil at me...

412
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:52,307
and said you were teaching me
to read all wrong...

413
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:53,907
and to stop it.

414
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:57,464
and then acted like a fool and tried
to give Walter Cunningham a quarter...

415
00:37:57,554 --> 00:38:01,945
when everybody knows Cunninghams
won't take nothin' from nobody.

416
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,104
Any fool
could have told her that.

417
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,583
Maybe she's just nervous.

418
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:10,667
After all, it's her first day
teachin' school and bein' new here.

419
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,747
Now wait a minute.

420
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:19,223
If you learn this single trick...

421
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:22,192
you'll get along a lot better
with all kinds of folks.

422
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:24,185
You never really
understand a person...

423
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:27,346
until you consider things
from his point of view.

424
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:28,992
Sir?

425
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:33,306
Till you climb inside of his skin
and walk around in it.

426
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,273
But if l keep goin' to school,
we can't ever read anymore.

427
00:38:44,194 --> 00:38:47,072
Do you know
what a compromise is?

428
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:49,945
Bendin' the law?

429
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:57,905
No, it's an agreement
reached by mutual consent.

430
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:05,070
Now here's the way it works.

431
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:08,430
You concede the necessity
of goin' to school...

432
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:13,943
we'll keep right on readin'
the same every night...

433
00:39:14,034 --> 00:39:15,865
just as we always have.

434
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:19,983
Is that a bargain?

435
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:25,823
There just didn't seem to be...

436
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:29,111
anyone or anything
Atticus couldn't explain.

437
00:39:30,194 --> 00:39:33,823
Though it wasn't a talent that would
arouse the admiration of our friends...

438
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,303
Jem and l had to admit
he was very good at that.

439
00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:39,703
But that was all he was good at...

440
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,625
we thought.

441
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:43,825
See? There he is.

442
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,509
Come on inside.

443
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:59,425
Come on. Get in.

444
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:09,426
Mr Finch? This is Cal.

445
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:12,267
I swear to God, there's a mad dog
down the street a piece.

446
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:14,231
He's comin' this way!

447
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:24,189
There he is.

448
00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:28,951
He's got it, all right, Mr Finch.

449
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:34,989
Stay inside, son.
Keep him in there, Cal.

450
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:38,424
He's within range, Heck.

451
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:42,827
- Take him, Mr Finch.
- No, Mr Tate.

452
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:45,030
- He can't shoot!
- Don't waste time.

453
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:48,345
For God's sake,
he's got to be killed right away.

454
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,312
Look where he is. I can't shoot
that well, and you know it.

455
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:53,988
- I haven't shot a gun in years.
- I'd feel mighty comfortable...

456
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:55,951
if you did now.

457
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:50,304
Don't go near that dog.
He's just as dangerous dead as alive.

458
00:41:50,394 --> 00:41:52,225
Yes, sir.

459
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:56,471
Yes, son.

460
00:41:59,514 --> 00:42:01,903
- Nothin'.
- What's the matter, boy?

461
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:05,191
Can't you talk? Didn't you know your
daddy's the best shot in this county?

462
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,391
Hush, Heck.
Let's get back to town.

463
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:11,307
- Remember, now. Don't go near that dog.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:15,434
I'll send Zeebo out right away
to pick him up.

465
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:38,233
Can we go with you?

466
00:42:38,314 --> 00:42:40,305
- Can we? Please?
- Huh? Can we?

467
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:43,511
No. I have to go to the country
on business, and you'll just get tired.

468
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,233
No, not me!
l won't get tired.

469
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:50,387
Well, promise to stay in the car
while l talk to Helen Robinson.

470
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,469
And not nag me about leavin'
if you do get tired.

471
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:55,392
All right. Climb in.

472
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:07,673
- Who's Helen Robinson?
- The wife of the man l'm defending.

473
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:29,224
- Good evening, David.
- Good evening.

474
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:31,782
- Good evening, Helen.
- Evening, Mr Finch.

475
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:33,865
I came over to tell you
about my visit with Tom.

476
00:43:33,954 --> 00:43:35,467
- Yes, sir.
- And to let you know...

477
00:43:35,554 --> 00:43:37,624
that l got a postponement
of the trial.

478
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:12,789
Would you tell my daddy
to come out here, please?

479
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:03,347
You nigger lover.

480
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:23,305
There's no need to be afraid of him,
son. He's all bluff.

481
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,504
Nigger lover!

482
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,865
There's a lot of ugly things
in this world, son.

483
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:57,904
I wish l could keep 'em all
away from you.

484
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,671
That's never possible.

485
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:08,064
If you wait till l get Scout in bed,
l'll drive you home.

486
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:10,031
Yes, sir.

487
00:46:24,154 --> 00:46:27,146
Do you mind stayin' here with Scout
till l get Cal home?

488
00:46:27,234 --> 00:46:29,794
- No, sir.
- Night, Jem.

489
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,705
Night, Cal.

490
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:59,191
Atticus had promised me
he would wear me out...

491
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:02,027
if he ever heard
of me fightin' anymore.

492
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:05,424
I was far too old and too big
for such childish things.

493
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:07,664
And the sooner
l learned to hold in...

494
00:49:07,754 --> 00:49:10,427
the better off
everybody would be.

495
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,345
I soon forgot.

496
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:15,823
CeciI Jacobs made me forget.

497
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:21,505
What is it?

498
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,909
Atticus, do you defend niggers?

499
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,832
- Don't say "nigger."
- I didn't say it.

500
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:37,145
Cecil Jacobs did.
That's why l had to fight him.

501
00:49:37,754 --> 00:49:40,029
Scout, l don't want you fightin'.

502
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:45,351
- I had to. He--
- I don't care what the reasons are.

503
00:49:45,434 --> 00:49:49,507
- I forbid you to fight.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:49:55,394 --> 00:49:59,865
Anyway, l'm simply defending
a Negro. Tom Robinson.

505
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:04,785
There are some things...

506
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:07,183
that you're not old enough
to understand just yet.

507
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:14,224
There's been some high talk
around town...

508
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:17,272
to the effect that l shouldn't do much
about defending this man.

509
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:24,553
If you shouldn't be defending him,
then why are you doing it?

510
00:50:29,714 --> 00:50:31,545
For a number of reasons.

511
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:36,069
The main one is,
that if l didn't...

512
00:50:36,154 --> 00:50:38,463
I couldn't hold my head up in town.

513
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:42,707
I couldn't even
tell you or Jem...

514
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:44,625
not to do somethin' again.

515
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:55,063
You're gonna hear some ugly talk
about this in school.

516
00:50:56,634 --> 00:51:00,946
But l want you
to promise me one thing:

517
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:04,026
that you won't get
into fights over it...

518
00:51:04,114 --> 00:51:06,423
no matter what they say to you.

519
00:51:12,914 --> 00:51:14,745
Yes, sir.

520
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,625
What are you doing?

521
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:31,944
Walkin' like an Egyptian.

522
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,184
We were studyin'
about 'em in school.

523
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:36,469
Teacher says we wouldn't be
no place without 'em.

524
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:38,706
Is that so?

525
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:42,673
Cradle of civilization. They invented
embalming and toilet paper.

526
00:51:45,194 --> 00:51:47,424
That's wrong.

527
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,463
You do your feet this way.

528
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,112
Look.

529
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:13,753
Look. The boy wears hair in front
of his eyebrows like you do.

530
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:17,593
Yeah, and the girl
wears bangs like you.

531
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:19,505
These are of us.

532
00:53:12,914 --> 00:53:14,586
You awake?

533
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:18,110
- Go back to bed.
- I can't go to sleep.

534
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:22,472
- Go back to bed.
- What you got in the box?

535
00:53:22,554 --> 00:53:24,545
Nothin'. Go back to bed.

536
00:53:32,354 --> 00:53:34,231
Come on.

537
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:44,311
If l show you, will you swear
never to tell anybody?

538
00:53:45,594 --> 00:53:48,711
- I swear.
- Cross your heart.

539
00:54:09,634 --> 00:54:11,989
I found all of these...

540
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:15,066
in the knothole of that old tree
at different times.

541
00:54:17,114 --> 00:54:19,912
This is a spelling medal.

542
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:24,793
You know they used to award these
in school to spelling winners...

543
00:54:24,874 --> 00:54:27,183
before we were born.

544
00:54:28,234 --> 00:54:31,624
And another time l found this.

545
00:54:45,394 --> 00:54:47,225
This.

546
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:03,631
And Scout...

547
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:05,545
you know somethin' else
l never told you...

548
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:07,943
about that night l went back
to the Radley house?

549
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:11,663
Somethin' else? You never told me
anything about that night.

550
00:55:12,554 --> 00:55:14,829
Well...

551
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:17,348
you know the first time when l was
gettin' out of my britches?

552
00:55:18,594 --> 00:55:20,903
They was all in a tangle...

553
00:55:20,994 --> 00:55:22,871
and l couldn't get 'em loose.

554
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,272
Well, when l went back, though...

555
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:31,664
they were folded
across the fence...

556
00:55:31,754 --> 00:55:33,984
sort of like
they was expectin' me.

557
00:55:41,194 --> 00:55:43,754
It was to be a long time...

558
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,951
before Jem and l
talked about Boo again.

559
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:52,426
School finally ended
and summer came...

560
00:55:53,394 --> 00:55:54,793
and so did Dill.

561
00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:57,024
- Good mornin'!
- Good mornin'.

562
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:59,833
My, you're up
mighty bright and early.

563
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:03,270
- I been up since 4:00.
- 4:00?

564
00:56:03,354 --> 00:56:07,108
Yes. I always get up at 4:00.
It's in my blood.

565
00:56:07,194 --> 00:56:10,630
You see, my daddy was a railroad man
till he got rich.

566
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:13,672
Now he flies aeroplanes.
One of these days...

567
00:56:13,754 --> 00:56:15,745
he's just gonna swoop
down here at Maycomb...

568
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:18,394
pick me up
and take me for a ride.

569
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:31,909
-Who's that in the car with the sheriff?
-Tom Robinson, son.

570
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:35,987
- Where's he been?
- In the Abbottsville Jail.

571
00:56:37,034 --> 00:56:40,743
- Why?
- Sheriff thought he'd be safer there.

572
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:43,348
They're bringin' him
back here tonight...

573
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,265
because his trial is tomorrow.

574
00:57:02,554 --> 00:57:05,352
- Good evenin', Heck.
- Good evenin', Mr Finch.

575
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,545
Come in.

576
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:17,272
News has gotten around that l brought
Tom Robinson back to the jail.

577
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:21,745
I heard there might be trouble
from that bunch out at Old Sarum.

578
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,747
If l need you to stay here tonight,
can you do it?

579
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:36,870
- Yes, sir, l can.
- Thank you.

580
00:57:43,674 --> 00:57:47,986
- I think you better count on stayin'.
- Yes, sir.

581
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:23,594
- What's goin' on?
- Go back to sleep.

582
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,551
What's goin' on?

583
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:37,071
There's his car.

584
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:52,309
See? There he is over there!

585
00:58:55,474 --> 00:58:58,705
No, Scout. Don't go to him.
He might not like it.

586
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,111
I just wanted to see where he was
and what he was up to.

587
00:59:04,714 --> 00:59:06,466
He's all right.
Let's go back home.

588
00:59:06,554 --> 00:59:08,385
Come on.

589
01:00:03,754 --> 01:00:07,747
- He in there, Mr Finch?
- He is.

590
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:11,349
He's asleep. Don't wake him.

591
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:13,823
You know what we want.

592
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:18,746
Get aside from that door, Mr Finch.

593
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:22,585
Walter...

594
01:00:24,594 --> 01:00:26,983
I think you ought to turn
right around and go back home.

595
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:31,543
- Heck Tate's around here somewhere.
- No, he ain't.

596
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:34,592
Heck and his bunch
is out in Old Sarum lookin' for us.

597
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:37,142
We knowed he was,
so we come in this other way.

598
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:39,702
You ain't thought about that,
had you, Mr Finch?

599
01:00:39,794 --> 01:00:42,467
- I thought about it.
- I can't see Atticus.

600
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:45,671
That changes things some.

601
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:55,786
Jem, go home,
and take Scout and Dill with you.

602
01:00:57,834 --> 01:01:01,110
- Son, l said go home.
- No, sir.

603
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:07,187
- I'll send him home.
- Don't you touch him! Let him go!

604
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:09,545
That'll do!

605
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,064
Ain't nobody
gonna do Jem that way!

606
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:18,789
Now you get them out of here.

607
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:25,790
- I want you to please leave.
- No, sir.

608
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:32,784
- I tell you l ain't goin'.
- Hey, Mr Cunningham.

609
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:39,592
I said, "Hey, Mr Cunningham."
How's your entailment getting along?

610
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:46,463
Don't you remember me,
Mr Cunningham?

611
01:01:46,554 --> 01:01:48,749
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

612
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:54,708
You brought us some hickory nuts
one early morning. Remember?

613
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,870
We had a talk.

614
01:01:58,794 --> 01:02:01,911
I went and got my daddy
to come out and thank you.

615
01:02:02,554 --> 01:02:06,069
I go to school with your boy.
I go to school with Walter.

616
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:10,786
He's a nice boy.
Tell him "hey" for me, won't you?

617
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:13,784
You know somethin',
Mr Cunningham?

618
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:17,071
Entailments are bad.
Entailments--

619
01:02:25,794 --> 01:02:29,753
I was just sayin' to Mr Cunningham
that entailments were bad...

620
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:31,904
but not to worry.

621
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:34,508
Takes a long time sometimes.

622
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,949
What's the matter?

623
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:49,383
I sure meant no harm,
Mr Cunningham.

624
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:55,343
No harm taken, young lady.

625
01:02:58,634 --> 01:03:01,467
I'll tell Walter you said "hey."

626
01:03:01,554 --> 01:03:03,624
Let's clear out of here.

627
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:06,825
Let's go, boys.

628
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:34,107
Now you go home.

629
01:03:34,194 --> 01:03:36,754
All of you.

630
01:03:36,834 --> 01:03:38,665
I'll be there later.

631
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:42,345
Come on.

632
01:04:08,274 --> 01:04:11,823
Mr Finch, they gone?

633
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:16,753
They've gone.
They won't bother you anymore.

634
01:04:36,714 --> 01:04:38,545
Morning, Mr Strikes.

635
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:41,273
- How do you do?
- Ever seen so many people?

636
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:43,709
Just like on Saturday.

637
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:48,867
- Where you goin'?
- I can't stand it any longer.

638
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:51,673
- I'm goin' to the courthouse and watch.
- Better not.

639
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,393
- You know what Atticus said.
- I don't care if he did.

640
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,910
I'm not gonna miss the most exciting
thing that ever happened in this town.

641
01:05:16,794 --> 01:05:20,582
It's packed solid.
They're standin' all along the back.

642
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:24,468
- Reverend.
- Yes?

643
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:28,513
-Reverend Sykes, are you going upstairs?
-Yes, l am.

644
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:41,071
Thank you, Brother Joe,
for holding my seat.

645
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:43,463
Come on, children.
Come on, come on.

646
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:19,432
This court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

647
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:33,309
On the night of August 21 ...

648
01:06:33,394 --> 01:06:37,103
I was just leaving my office
to go home when Bob--

649
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:39,469
Mr Ewell-- came in.

650
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:42,311
Very excited he was,
and he said...

651
01:06:42,394 --> 01:06:45,147
to get to his house
as quick as l could...

652
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,509
that his girl had been raped.

653
01:06:47,594 --> 01:06:51,951
I got in my car and went out there
as fast as l could.

654
01:06:52,034 --> 01:06:53,865
She was pretty well beat up.

655
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:58,589
I asked her if Tom Robinson
beat her like that.

656
01:06:58,674 --> 01:07:00,744
She said yes, he had.

657
01:07:02,074 --> 01:07:05,271
I asked if he'd
taken advantage of her.

658
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,232
She said yes, he did.

659
01:07:08,314 --> 01:07:10,669
That's all there was to it.

660
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:13,832
Thank you.

661
01:07:16,714 --> 01:07:19,990
Did anybody call
a doctor, Sheriff?

662
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:22,713
- No, sir.
- Why not?

663
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:24,944
Well, l didn't think
it was necessary.

664
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:27,229
She was pretty well beat up.

665
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,384
Somethin' sure happened.
It was obvious.

666
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:36,503
Now, Sheriff, you say that she
was mighty beat up. In what way?

667
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,347
Well, she was beaten
around the head.

668
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:42,392
There were bruises
already comin' on her arms.

669
01:07:42,474 --> 01:07:45,466
She had a black eye startin'.

670
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:48,830
- Which eye?
- Let's see.

671
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:50,745
It was her left.

672
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:54,752
Well, now, was that--

673
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:57,428
That was her left,
facing you...

674
01:07:57,514 --> 01:07:59,391
or looking the way
that you were?

675
01:07:59,474 --> 01:08:03,433
Yes, that would make it
her right eye.

676
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:07,711
It was her right eye, Mr Finch.
Now l remember.

677
01:08:07,794 --> 01:08:11,150
She was beaten up
on that side of her face.

678
01:08:16,714 --> 01:08:19,069
Which side again, Heck?

679
01:08:19,154 --> 01:08:20,826
The right side.

680
01:08:21,954 --> 01:08:24,263
She had bruises on her arms.

681
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:29,982
She showed me her neck. There were
definite finger marks on her gullet.

682
01:08:33,714 --> 01:08:38,583
All around her neck,
at the back of her throat?

683
01:08:40,434 --> 01:08:42,390
I'd say they were all around.

684
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:52,305
The witness may be seated.

685
01:08:54,354 --> 01:08:55,707
Robert E. Lee Ewell.

686
01:09:00,994 --> 01:09:02,825
Place your hand
on the Bible, please.

687
01:09:02,914 --> 01:09:05,872
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

688
01:09:05,954 --> 01:09:07,945
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

689
01:09:11,274 --> 01:09:13,105
Now, Mr Ewell...

690
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:16,072
you tell us,
just in your own words...

691
01:09:16,154 --> 01:09:19,066
what happened on August 21 .

692
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:20,712
That night...

693
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:23,547
I was comin' from the woods
with a load of kindlin'...

694
01:09:23,634 --> 01:09:26,751
and l heard Mayella screaming
as l got to the fence.

695
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:31,225
I dropped my kindlin', and l run as fast
as l could, but l run into the fence.

696
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:35,592
But when l got loose,
l run up to the window...

697
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:38,188
and l seen him with my Mayella!

698
01:09:43,314 --> 01:09:44,667
What did you do...

699
01:09:44,754 --> 01:09:47,222
after you saw the defendant?

700
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:49,145
I run around the house
tryin' to get in...

701
01:09:49,234 --> 01:09:52,306
but he done run through
the front door just ahead of me!

702
01:09:52,394 --> 01:09:54,305
But l seen who it was,
all right!

703
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:57,385
I seen him.

704
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,146
And l run in the house and...

705
01:10:03,234 --> 01:10:05,702
poor Mayella was layin'
on the floor squallin'.

706
01:10:07,314 --> 01:10:10,112
Then l run for Mr Tate
just as quick as l could.

707
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:14,182
Thank you.

708
01:10:23,434 --> 01:10:27,712
Would you mind if l just
ask you a few questions, Mr Ewell?

709
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:30,149
No, sir, Mr Finch,
l sure wouldn't.

710
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:37,829
Folks were doin'
a lot of running that night.

711
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:42,465
You say that you ran to the house,
you ran to the window...

712
01:10:42,554 --> 01:10:46,752
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella
and you ran to Sheriff Tate.

713
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:51,112
Did you, during all this running,
run for a doctor?

714
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:53,947
There wasn't no need to.
I seen who done it.

715
01:10:56,314 --> 01:10:59,431
Now, Mr Ewell, you've heard
the sheriff's testimony.

716
01:10:59,514 --> 01:11:01,869
Do you agree with his description
of Mayella's injuries?

717
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:06,104
I agree with everything
Mr Tate said.

718
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:08,025
Her eye was blacked.

719
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:11,584
She was mighty beat up,
mighty beat up.

720
01:11:13,754 --> 01:11:18,828
Now, Mr Ewell, can you--
Can you read and write?

721
01:11:21,074 --> 01:11:24,749
Yes, sir, Mr Finch,
l can read and l can write.

722
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:27,788
Good.

723
01:11:28,874 --> 01:11:31,911
Then will you write
your name, please?

724
01:11:31,994 --> 01:11:34,713
Right there.
Show us.

725
01:12:05,114 --> 01:12:06,991
What's so interesting?

726
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:08,905
You're left-handed, Mr Ewell.

727
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:12,987
What's that got to do with it, Judge?
l'm a God-fearin' man.

728
01:12:13,074 --> 01:12:15,542
That Atticus Finch,
he's tryin' to take advantage of me!

729
01:12:15,634 --> 01:12:18,102
You got to watch tricky lawyers
like Atticus Finch!

730
01:12:18,194 --> 01:12:20,503
Quiet! Quiet, sir.

731
01:12:20,594 --> 01:12:23,392
Now the witness
may take his seat.

732
01:12:33,434 --> 01:12:35,106
Mayella Violet Ewell.

733
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,224
Put your hand
on the Bible, please.

734
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:55,102
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

735
01:12:55,194 --> 01:12:57,105
Sit down, please.

736
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:03,225
Now, Mayella...

737
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:09,070
suppose you tell us
just what happened, huh?

738
01:13:16,154 --> 01:13:19,942
I was sittin' on the porch
and he come along.

739
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:26,549
There's this old chifforobe
in the yard...

740
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:29,902
and l said...

741
01:13:29,994 --> 01:13:32,554
"You come in here, boy,
and bust up this chifforobe...

742
01:13:32,634 --> 01:13:34,784
and l'll give you a nickel."

743
01:13:36,114 --> 01:13:38,628
So he come on in the yard...

744
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,433
and l go in the house
to get him the nickel...

745
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:45,547
and l turn around
and before l know it, he's on me.

746
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,073
I fought and hollered...

747
01:13:49,154 --> 01:13:51,622
but he had me around the neck...

748
01:13:51,714 --> 01:13:55,229
and he hit me,
again and again.

749
01:13:57,554 --> 01:14:02,025
And the next thing l knew,
Papa was in the room...

750
01:14:02,114 --> 01:14:04,230
standin' over me, hollerin'...

751
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:07,590
"Who done it? Who done it?"

752
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:10,471
Thank you, Mayella.

753
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:14,030
Your witness, Atticus.

754
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:18,832
Miss Mayella...

755
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:23,588
is your father good to you?

756
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:26,711
I mean, is he easy
to get along with?

757
01:14:28,514 --> 01:14:29,867
Does tolerable.

758
01:14:29,954 --> 01:14:32,184
Except when he's drinking.

759
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:38,071
When he's riled,
has he ever beaten you?

760
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:47,984
My pa's never touched
a hair on my head in my life.

761
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:57,589
You say that you asked Tom to come in
and chop up a-- What was it?

762
01:14:59,034 --> 01:15:00,513
A chifforobe.

763
01:15:00,594 --> 01:15:03,267
Was that the first time...

764
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:05,629
that you ever asked him
to come inside the fence?

765
01:15:06,634 --> 01:15:07,987
Yes.

766
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:11,550
Didn't you ever ask him...

767
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:13,943
to come inside the fence before?

768
01:15:18,074 --> 01:15:19,951
I might have.

769
01:15:21,074 --> 01:15:23,304
Can you remember
any other occasion?

770
01:15:26,194 --> 01:15:28,025
You say...

771
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:31,709
"He caught me, he choked me,
and he took advantage of me."

772
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:33,147
Is that right?

773
01:15:36,874 --> 01:15:39,149
Do you remember him
beating you about the face?

774
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:43,185
No.

775
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:44,787
I don't...

776
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:48,944
recollect if he hit me.

777
01:15:53,074 --> 01:15:56,225
I mean, yes!
He hit me!

778
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:57,906
He hit me!

779
01:16:03,754 --> 01:16:05,107
Thank you.

780
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,833
Now, will you identify
the man who beat you?

781
01:16:07,914 --> 01:16:10,872
I most certainly will.
Sittin' right yonder.

782
01:16:13,274 --> 01:16:16,072
Tom, will you stand up, please?

783
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,464
Let Miss Mayella have
a good long look at you.

784
01:16:28,754 --> 01:16:30,904
Will you catch this, please?

785
01:16:35,194 --> 01:16:36,183
Thank you.

786
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:43,073
Now, then, this time will you
please catch it with your left hand.

787
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:45,667
I can't, sir.

788
01:16:45,754 --> 01:16:47,426
Why can't you?

789
01:16:47,514 --> 01:16:49,823
I can't use my left hand at all.

790
01:16:50,874 --> 01:16:54,583
I got it caught in a cotton gin
when l was 12 years old.

791
01:16:54,674 --> 01:16:57,108
All my muscles were tore loose.

792
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:15,869
Is this the man who raped you?

793
01:17:18,114 --> 01:17:19,991
It most certainly is.

794
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:22,513
How?

795
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:28,784
I don't know how... He done it.

796
01:17:28,874 --> 01:17:31,024
He just done it.

797
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:33,912
You have testified...

798
01:17:33,994 --> 01:17:37,907
that he choked you
and he beat you.

799
01:17:38,874 --> 01:17:43,026
You didn't say that he sneaked up
behind you and knocked you out cold...

800
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:47,265
but that you turned around...

801
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:49,948
and there he was.

802
01:17:51,154 --> 01:17:53,952
Do you want to tell us
what really happened?

803
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:58,349
I got somethin' to say...

804
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:02,902
and then l ain't
gonna say no more!

805
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:09,632
He took advantage of me!

806
01:18:12,514 --> 01:18:14,823
And if you fine...

807
01:18:14,914 --> 01:18:16,825
fancy gentlemen...

808
01:18:16,914 --> 01:18:19,030
ain't gonna do
nothin' about it...

809
01:18:19,114 --> 01:18:21,503
then you're just
a bunch of lousy...

810
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:24,028
yellow, stinkin' cowards...

811
01:18:24,114 --> 01:18:26,344
the whole bunch of ya!

812
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:29,551
And your fancy airs
don't come to nothin'!

813
01:18:29,634 --> 01:18:32,671
Your "ma'am"-ing
and your "Miss Mayella"-ing...

814
01:18:32,754 --> 01:18:35,666
it don't come to nothin',
Mr Finch!

815
01:18:40,874 --> 01:18:43,183
You sit down now.

816
01:18:59,474 --> 01:19:01,066
Atticus.

817
01:19:04,154 --> 01:19:05,382
Mr Gilmer.

818
01:19:09,634 --> 01:19:11,864
The State rests, Judge.

819
01:19:19,794 --> 01:19:22,069
Tom Robinson, take the stand.

820
01:19:36,714 --> 01:19:38,511
Put your hand on the Bible.

821
01:19:39,594 --> 01:19:42,791
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

822
01:19:42,874 --> 01:19:44,705
- I do.
- Sit down.

823
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:02,150
Were you acquainted
with Mayella Violet Ewell?

824
01:20:02,234 --> 01:20:03,383
Yes, sir.

825
01:20:03,474 --> 01:20:06,864
I had to pass her place
going to and from the field every day.

826
01:20:07,874 --> 01:20:10,308
Is there any other way to go?

827
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:13,704
No, sir.
None's l know of.

828
01:20:13,794 --> 01:20:15,944
And did she ever speak to you?

829
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:18,150
Why, yes, sir.

830
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:20,509
I'd tip my hat when l'd go by.

831
01:20:21,754 --> 01:20:24,951
And one day she asked me
to come inside the fence...

832
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:27,992
and bust up a chifforobe for her.

833
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:30,588
She give me the hatchet,
and l broke it up.

834
01:20:30,674 --> 01:20:33,029
And then she said...

835
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:35,309
"l reckon l'll have
to give you a nickel, won't l?"

836
01:20:35,394 --> 01:20:39,103
And l said, "No, ma'am.
There ain't no charge."

837
01:20:39,194 --> 01:20:41,025
And l went home.

838
01:20:42,074 --> 01:20:46,352
Mr Finch, that was way last spring,
way over a year ago.

839
01:20:47,674 --> 01:20:49,744
Did you ever go
on the place again?

840
01:20:53,154 --> 01:20:54,553
Yes, sir.

841
01:20:55,474 --> 01:20:56,987
When?

842
01:20:59,274 --> 01:21:02,789
I went lots of times.

843
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:05,434
Seemed like every time
l passed by yonder...

844
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:07,903
she'd have some little
somethin' for me to do:

845
01:21:07,994 --> 01:21:10,667
chopping kindlin'
and totin' water for her.

846
01:21:22,074 --> 01:21:23,905
What happened to you...

847
01:21:23,994 --> 01:21:27,350
on the evening
of August 21 of last year?

848
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:40,192
I was goin' home
as usual that evenin'.

849
01:21:42,074 --> 01:21:44,872
When l passed the Ewell place...

850
01:21:44,954 --> 01:21:48,663
Miss Mayella were on the porch,
like she said she were.

851
01:21:48,754 --> 01:21:52,429
She said for me to come there
and help her a minute.

852
01:21:53,314 --> 01:21:55,874
I went inside the fence...

853
01:21:55,954 --> 01:22:00,823
and l looked around for some kindlin'
to work on, but l didn't see none.

854
01:22:02,714 --> 01:22:05,547
Then she said
to come in the house...

855
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:07,829
she has a door needs fixin'.

856
01:22:08,634 --> 01:22:10,784
So l follows her inside...

857
01:22:10,874 --> 01:22:14,549
and l looked at the door,
and it looked all right.

858
01:22:15,954 --> 01:22:17,307
Then she shut the door.

859
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:23,752
All the time l was wonderin'
why it was so quiet like.

860
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,188
And then it come to me.

861
01:22:28,274 --> 01:22:31,072
There was not a child
on the place.

862
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:35,750
And l said, "Miss Mayella,
where are the children?"

863
01:22:37,394 --> 01:22:40,352
She said, "They all gone
to get ice cream."

864
01:22:40,434 --> 01:22:45,269
She said it took her a year to save
seven nickels, but she'd done it.

865
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:47,504
And they'd all gone to town.

866
01:22:49,194 --> 01:22:50,547
What did you say then?

867
01:22:53,714 --> 01:22:56,182
I said somethin' like...

868
01:22:56,274 --> 01:23:00,187
"Why, Miss Mayella,
that's right nice of you to treat 'em."

869
01:23:01,234 --> 01:23:03,464
She said, "You think so?"

870
01:23:03,554 --> 01:23:06,785
"Well," l said, "l best be goin'."

871
01:23:06,874 --> 01:23:11,152
I couldn't do nothin' for her.
And she said yes, l could.

872
01:23:11,234 --> 01:23:13,111
And l asked her what.

873
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:18,183
And she said to just step
on the chair yonder...

874
01:23:18,274 --> 01:23:22,062
and get that box down
from on top of the chifforobe.

875
01:23:23,914 --> 01:23:27,111
So l done like she told me...

876
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:30,152
and l was reachin'...

877
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:34,864
when the next thing l know,
she grabbed me around the legs.

878
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:45,667
She scared me so bad, l hopped down
and turned the chair over.

879
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,222
That was the only thing--

880
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,067
only furniture--
disturbed in the room, Mr Finch...

881
01:23:51,154 --> 01:23:53,384
I swear, when l left it.

882
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:58,907
And what happened
after you turned the chair over?

883
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:17,270
You've sworn to tell the whole truth.
Will you do it?

884
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:22,862
What happened after that?

885
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:32,948
I got down off the chair...

886
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:36,151
and l turned around...

887
01:24:36,234 --> 01:24:38,907
and she sort of jumped on me.

888
01:24:39,994 --> 01:24:42,906
She hugged me around the waist.

889
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,792
She reached up
and kissed me on the face.

890
01:24:47,194 --> 01:24:51,790
She said she'd never kissed
a grown man before...

891
01:24:51,874 --> 01:24:54,229
and she might as well kiss me.

892
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:57,908
She says for me
to kiss her back...

893
01:24:59,434 --> 01:25:03,268
and l said, "Miss Mayella,
let me out of here"...

894
01:25:03,354 --> 01:25:05,185
and l tried to run.

895
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:10,708
Mr Ewell cussed at her
from the window.

896
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:14,110
He said he's gonna kill her.

897
01:25:22,514 --> 01:25:24,152
What happened after that?

898
01:25:27,674 --> 01:25:32,111
I was runnin' so fast,
l don't know what happened.

899
01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:43,389
Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell?

900
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,425
I did not, sir.

901
01:25:50,554 --> 01:25:53,068
Did you harm her in any way?

902
01:25:59,874 --> 01:26:02,342
I did not, sir.

903
01:26:20,954 --> 01:26:22,467
Robinson...

904
01:26:24,234 --> 01:26:28,466
you're good at bustin' up chifforobes
and kindlin' with one hand, aren't ya?

905
01:26:28,554 --> 01:26:30,784
Strong enough to choke the breath
out of a woman...

906
01:26:30,874 --> 01:26:32,785
and sling her to the floor?

907
01:26:33,834 --> 01:26:36,985
- I never done that, sir.
- But you're strong enough to.

908
01:26:38,714 --> 01:26:40,545
I reckon so, sir.

909
01:26:47,074 --> 01:26:50,669
How come you so all-fired anxious
to do that woman's chores?

910
01:26:54,234 --> 01:26:57,544
Looks like she--
she didn't have nobody to help her.

911
01:26:58,554 --> 01:26:59,748
Like l said--

912
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:02,951
With Mr Ewell and seven children
on the place?

913
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:06,822
You did all this choppin' and work
out of sheer goodness, boy?

914
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:10,743
You're a mighty good fella,
it seems.

915
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:13,109
Did all that for not one penny?

916
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:18,586
Yes, sir.
I felt right sorry for her.

917
01:27:18,674 --> 01:27:20,027
She seemed--

918
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,904
You felt sorry for her?

919
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:40,785
A white woman?

920
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:45,746
You felt sorry for her.

921
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:19,788
To begin with...

922
01:28:19,874 --> 01:28:22,388
this case should never
have come to trial.

923
01:28:22,474 --> 01:28:25,432
The State has not produced
one iota...

924
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:27,425
of medical evidence...

925
01:28:27,514 --> 01:28:31,063
that the crime Tom Robinson
is charged with...

926
01:28:31,154 --> 01:28:33,429
ever took place.

927
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,709
It has relied, instead...

928
01:28:36,794 --> 01:28:39,911
upon the testimony
of two witnesses...

929
01:28:39,994 --> 01:28:43,225
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question...

930
01:28:43,314 --> 01:28:45,748
on cross-examination...

931
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:49,588
but has been flatly contradicted
by the defendant.

932
01:28:51,754 --> 01:28:55,030
There is circumstantial evidence
to indicate that...

933
01:28:55,114 --> 01:28:57,674
Mayella Ewell was beaten...

934
01:28:57,754 --> 01:28:59,745
savagely...

935
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:04,305
by someone who led,
almost exclusively, with his left.

936
01:29:06,994 --> 01:29:10,873
Tom Robinson now sits before you,
having taken the oath...

937
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:14,469
with the only good hand
he possesses...

938
01:29:14,554 --> 01:29:16,431
his right.

939
01:29:27,354 --> 01:29:30,505
I have nothing but pity
in my heart...

940
01:29:32,434 --> 01:29:35,153
for the chief witness
for the State.

941
01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:39,745
She is the victim...

942
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:43,031
of cruel poverty and ignorance.

943
01:29:46,554 --> 01:29:49,830
But, my pity...

944
01:29:49,914 --> 01:29:52,951
does not extend so far...

945
01:29:53,034 --> 01:29:56,026
as to her putting
a man's life at stake...

946
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:01,393
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

947
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:05,626
I say "guilt," gentlemen...

948
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:09,343
because it was guilt...

949
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:11,504
that motivated her.

950
01:30:12,554 --> 01:30:14,704
She's committed no crime.

951
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:18,907
She has merely broken
a rigid and time-honoured...

952
01:30:18,994 --> 01:30:21,110
code of our society.

953
01:30:22,594 --> 01:30:26,746
A code so severe that whoever breaks it
is hounded from our midst...

954
01:30:26,834 --> 01:30:28,904
as unfit to live with.

955
01:30:28,994 --> 01:30:32,066
She must destroy the evidence...

956
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:33,985
of her offence.

957
01:30:35,034 --> 01:30:39,232
But what was the evidence
of her offence?

958
01:30:39,314 --> 01:30:43,023
Tom Robinson, a human being.

959
01:30:45,554 --> 01:30:48,944
She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

960
01:30:51,674 --> 01:30:55,303
Tom Robinson was to her
a daily reminder...

961
01:30:55,394 --> 01:30:58,113
of what she did.

962
01:30:58,194 --> 01:31:00,310
Now, what did she do?

963
01:31:01,434 --> 01:31:03,425
She tempted a Negro.

964
01:31:03,514 --> 01:31:06,267
She was white,
and she tempted a Negro.

965
01:31:07,794 --> 01:31:11,389
She did something that,
in our society, is unspeakable.

966
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,784
She kissed a black man.

967
01:31:14,874 --> 01:31:17,229
Not an old uncle...

968
01:31:19,034 --> 01:31:22,071
but a strong, young Negro man.

969
01:31:24,954 --> 01:31:28,583
No code mattered to her
before she broke it...

970
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:31,825
but it came crashing down
on her afterwards.

971
01:31:39,274 --> 01:31:41,105
The witnesses for the State...

972
01:31:41,194 --> 01:31:43,389
with the exception
of the sheriff of Maycomb County...

973
01:31:43,474 --> 01:31:46,705
have presented themselves
to you gentlemen, to this court...

974
01:31:48,474 --> 01:31:52,387
in the cynical confidence...

975
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:55,352
that their testimony
would not be doubted.

976
01:31:56,354 --> 01:31:59,426
Confident that you gentlemen...

977
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:02,506
would go along with them
on the assumption--

978
01:32:05,314 --> 01:32:07,111
the evil assumption--

979
01:32:07,194 --> 01:32:09,503
that all Negroes lie...

980
01:32:09,594 --> 01:32:12,711
all Negroes are basically
immoral beings...

981
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:16,946
all Negro men are not
to be trusted around our women.

982
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:25,154
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their calibre...

983
01:32:25,234 --> 01:32:29,432
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie.

984
01:32:32,154 --> 01:32:35,544
Which l do not need
to point out to you.

985
01:32:41,274 --> 01:32:42,912
And so...

986
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:47,510
a quiet, humble,
respectable Negro...

987
01:32:47,594 --> 01:32:51,269
who has had
the unmitigated temerity...

988
01:32:51,354 --> 01:32:54,187
to feel sorry
for a white woman...

989
01:32:55,674 --> 01:32:59,986
has had to put his word
against two white people's.

990
01:33:05,594 --> 01:33:08,188
The defendant is not guilty...

991
01:33:09,234 --> 01:33:12,271
but somebody
in this courtroom is.

992
01:33:14,074 --> 01:33:15,792
Now, gentlemen...

993
01:33:17,154 --> 01:33:19,145
in this country...

994
01:33:19,234 --> 01:33:23,068
our courts are
the great levellers.

995
01:33:23,154 --> 01:33:25,349
In our courts...

996
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:29,507
all men are created...

997
01:33:29,594 --> 01:33:31,152
equal.

998
01:33:32,154 --> 01:33:36,033
I'm no idealist
to believe firmly...

999
01:33:36,114 --> 01:33:39,106
in the integrity of our courts
and of our jury system.

1000
01:33:39,194 --> 01:33:43,665
That's no ideal to me.
That is a living, working reality!

1001
01:33:47,754 --> 01:33:52,111
I am confident that
you gentlemen will review...

1002
01:33:53,114 --> 01:33:56,186
without passion...

1003
01:33:56,274 --> 01:33:59,072
the evidence
that you have heard...

1004
01:34:00,394 --> 01:34:02,589
come to a decision...

1005
01:34:03,874 --> 01:34:06,547
and restore this man
to his family.

1006
01:34:15,994 --> 01:34:17,825
In the name of God...

1007
01:34:20,754 --> 01:34:22,585
do your duty.

1008
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:31,223
In the name of God...

1009
01:34:31,314 --> 01:34:33,145
believe...

1010
01:34:34,314 --> 01:34:36,145
Tom Robinson.

1011
01:35:09,634 --> 01:35:12,467
How long has the jury
been out now, Reverend?

1012
01:35:13,434 --> 01:35:15,504
Let's see.

1013
01:35:15,594 --> 01:35:18,711
Almost two hours now.

1014
01:35:20,154 --> 01:35:23,749
I think that's an awful
good sign, don't you?

1015
01:36:08,154 --> 01:36:10,668
Court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

1016
01:36:30,234 --> 01:36:33,624
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1017
01:36:33,714 --> 01:36:35,352
We have, Your Honour.

1018
01:36:39,914 --> 01:36:42,553
Will the defendant please rise
and face the jury.

1019
01:36:51,114 --> 01:36:53,503
What is your verdict?

1020
01:36:53,594 --> 01:36:56,392
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

1021
01:37:15,114 --> 01:37:18,026
Gentlemen,
this jury is dismissed.

1022
01:37:23,154 --> 01:37:24,985
Court is adjourned.

1023
01:37:35,794 --> 01:37:38,183
I'll go to see Helen
first thing tomorrow morning.

1024
01:37:38,274 --> 01:37:41,425
I told her not to be disappointed,
we'd probably lose this one.

1025
01:38:43,954 --> 01:38:45,307
Miss Jean Louise.

1026
01:38:46,794 --> 01:38:49,513
Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

1027
01:38:53,274 --> 01:38:55,265
Your father's passin'.

1028
01:39:29,354 --> 01:39:32,266
I'm sorry, Atticus.

1029
01:39:32,354 --> 01:39:34,390
Thank you, Maudie.

1030
01:39:42,874 --> 01:39:45,183
Atticus, can l see you
for a minute?

1031
01:39:47,834 --> 01:39:49,665
Will you excuse me?

1032
01:40:16,234 --> 01:40:17,906
Yes, ma'am?

1033
01:40:21,434 --> 01:40:24,346
I don't know if it'll help...

1034
01:40:24,434 --> 01:40:26,789
but l want to say this to you.

1035
01:40:30,794 --> 01:40:34,503
There's some men
in this world...

1036
01:40:34,594 --> 01:40:38,382
who are born to do
our unpleasant jobs for us.

1037
01:40:42,194 --> 01:40:44,310
Your father's one of them.

1038
01:40:48,594 --> 01:40:50,107
Oh, well.

1039
01:41:14,874 --> 01:41:17,388
What's the matter, Atticus?

1040
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:21,905
Tom Robinson's dead.

1041
01:41:31,914 --> 01:41:35,589
They were taking him
to Abbottsville...

1042
01:41:35,674 --> 01:41:38,029
for safekeeping.

1043
01:41:38,114 --> 01:41:40,469
Tom broke loose and ran.

1044
01:41:41,994 --> 01:41:44,462
The deputy...

1045
01:41:44,554 --> 01:41:47,387
called out to him to stop...

1046
01:41:47,474 --> 01:41:49,510
and Tom didn't stop.

1047
01:41:50,954 --> 01:41:53,548
He shot at him to wound him...

1048
01:41:53,634 --> 01:41:55,670
and missed his aim.

1049
01:41:58,714 --> 01:42:00,944
Killed him.

1050
01:42:05,034 --> 01:42:06,865
The deputy says...

1051
01:42:10,354 --> 01:42:13,187
Tom just ran like a crazy man.

1052
01:42:22,714 --> 01:42:25,023
The last thing l told him
was not to lose heart...

1053
01:42:25,114 --> 01:42:27,264
that we'd ask for an appeal.

1054
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:38,502
We had such a good chance.

1055
01:42:42,674 --> 01:42:45,507
We had more than a good chance.

1056
01:42:59,914 --> 01:43:02,223
I have to go out
and tell his family.

1057
01:43:03,354 --> 01:43:05,709
You look after
the children, Maudie.

1058
01:43:11,114 --> 01:43:13,833
Atticus, you want me
to go with you?

1059
01:43:13,914 --> 01:43:17,145
No, son. I think l'd better
go out there alone.

1060
01:43:20,474 --> 01:43:22,351
I'm goin' with you.

1061
01:43:24,194 --> 01:43:26,071
All right, son.

1062
01:43:48,474 --> 01:43:51,750
Hello, Mr Finch.
I'm Spence, Tom's father.

1063
01:43:52,794 --> 01:43:54,625
Hello, Spence.

1064
01:43:57,114 --> 01:43:58,467
- Is Helen here?
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:43:58,554 --> 01:44:01,751
She's inside lyin' down,
tryin' to get a little sleep.

1066
01:44:01,834 --> 01:44:04,223
We been talkin'
about the appeal, Mr Finch.

1067
01:44:04,314 --> 01:44:06,464
How long do you think it'll take?

1068
01:44:11,394 --> 01:44:13,749
There isn't going
to be any appeal.

1069
01:44:15,034 --> 01:44:18,151
Not now. Tom is dead.

1070
01:44:18,234 --> 01:44:19,792
Dead?

1071
01:44:57,234 --> 01:44:58,747
Boy.

1072
01:45:00,434 --> 01:45:04,188
Go inside and tell Atticus Finch
l said to come out here.

1073
01:45:05,274 --> 01:45:06,832
Go on, boy.

1074
01:46:40,874 --> 01:46:43,707
By October, things
had settled down again.

1075
01:46:45,114 --> 01:46:49,426
I still looked for Boo everytime
l went by the Radley place.

1076
01:46:53,034 --> 01:46:57,073
This night my mind
was filled with Halloween.

1077
01:46:57,154 --> 01:47:00,988
There was to be a pageant representing
our county's agricultural products.

1078
01:47:01,994 --> 01:47:03,825
I was to be a ham.

1079
01:47:05,754 --> 01:47:09,030
Jem said he would escort me
to the school auditorium.

1080
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:14,342
Thus began our longest
journey together.

1081
01:47:32,314 --> 01:47:34,305
- Scout.
- Yeah?

1082
01:47:35,354 --> 01:47:39,108
Will you come on?
Everybody's gone.

1083
01:47:39,194 --> 01:47:42,903
- I can't go home like this.
- Well, l'm going.

1084
01:47:42,994 --> 01:47:46,066
It's almost 10:00,
and Atticus will be waitin' for us.

1085
01:47:46,154 --> 01:47:48,714
All right, l'm comin'.

1086
01:47:48,794 --> 01:47:52,309
But l feel like a fool
walkin' home like this.

1087
01:47:52,394 --> 01:47:54,703
It's not my fault
you lost your dress.

1088
01:47:54,794 --> 01:47:57,672
I didn't lose it.
Just can't find it.

1089
01:47:57,754 --> 01:48:01,349
- Where are your shoes?
- I can't find them either.

1090
01:48:01,434 --> 01:48:03,789
- You can get 'em tomorrow.
- But tomorrow's Sunday.

1091
01:48:03,874 --> 01:48:07,025
You can get the janitor
to let you in. Come on.

1092
01:48:33,514 --> 01:48:36,904
Here, Scout. Let me hold on to you
before you break your neck.

1093
01:48:40,714 --> 01:48:43,182
Jem, you don't have
to hold me.

1094
01:48:45,594 --> 01:48:48,427
- What's the matter?
- Hush a minute, Scout.

1095
01:48:56,474 --> 01:48:58,829
I thought l heard somethin'.

1096
01:49:01,914 --> 01:49:02,903
Come on.

1097
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:16,185
Wait.

1098
01:49:16,274 --> 01:49:19,584
Are you trying to scare me?
You know l'm too old.

1099
01:49:19,674 --> 01:49:21,266
Be quiet.

1100
01:49:23,954 --> 01:49:26,309
- I hear an old dog bayin'.
- It's not that.

1101
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:29,033
I hear it when
we're walkin' along.

1102
01:49:29,114 --> 01:49:31,344
When we stop,
l don't hear it anymore.

1103
01:49:32,354 --> 01:49:35,710
Oh, yeah, my costume rustlin'.

1104
01:49:35,794 --> 01:49:38,069
Halloween's got ya.

1105
01:49:44,434 --> 01:49:46,345
I hear it now.

1106
01:49:46,434 --> 01:49:49,790
I'll bet it's just old
Cecil Jacobs tryin' to scare me.

1107
01:49:50,874 --> 01:49:53,593
Cecil Jacobs is a big, wet hen!

1108
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,273
Come on.

1109
01:50:40,674 --> 01:50:41,868
Run, Scout!

1110
01:50:41,954 --> 01:50:44,468
Run, Scout! Run! Run!

1111
01:52:33,594 --> 01:52:35,186
What happened?

1112
01:52:35,274 --> 01:52:37,583
I don't know.
I just don't know.

1113
01:52:39,274 --> 01:52:41,947
- Tell Dr Reynolds to come over.
- Yes, sir.

1114
01:52:44,234 --> 01:52:46,464
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:52:46,554 --> 01:52:48,704
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1116
01:52:56,914 --> 01:52:58,984
Sheriff Tate, please.

1117
01:52:59,074 --> 01:53:01,349
Atticus, is Jem dead?

1118
01:53:01,434 --> 01:53:03,994
No. He's unconscious.

1119
01:53:04,074 --> 01:53:06,986
We won't know how badly he's hurt
until the doctor gets here.

1120
01:53:07,074 --> 01:53:09,713
Heck? Atticus Finch.

1121
01:53:09,794 --> 01:53:11,864
Someone's been after my children.

1122
01:53:14,914 --> 01:53:17,303
He's got a bad break,
as far as l can tell.

1123
01:53:17,394 --> 01:53:20,272
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

1124
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:28,665
I'll be right back, Atticus.

1125
01:53:30,154 --> 01:53:33,112
- How's the boy, Doc?
- He'll be all right.

1126
01:53:35,834 --> 01:53:37,711
Sheriff Tate.

1127
01:53:56,474 --> 01:53:58,669
What is it, Heck?

1128
01:54:02,314 --> 01:54:05,033
Bob Ewell's lyin' on the ground
under that tree down yonder...

1129
01:54:05,114 --> 01:54:07,503
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

1130
01:54:11,034 --> 01:54:12,433
He's dead.

1131
01:54:26,914 --> 01:54:29,269
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:54:33,034 --> 01:54:35,502
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

1133
01:54:37,594 --> 01:54:39,949
Miss Scout, you think
you could tell us what happened?

1134
01:54:41,954 --> 01:54:43,831
I don't know.

1135
01:54:43,914 --> 01:54:47,793
All of a sudden somebody grabbed me,
knocked me down on the ground.

1136
01:54:47,874 --> 01:54:50,468
Jem found me then.

1137
01:54:50,554 --> 01:54:54,672
Then Mr Ewell, l reckon,
grabbed him again, and Jem hollered.

1138
01:54:54,754 --> 01:54:58,986
Then somebody grabbed me.
Mr Ewell, l guess.

1139
01:55:00,234 --> 01:55:02,065
Somebody grabbed him...

1140
01:55:02,154 --> 01:55:05,464
and then l heard someone
pantin' and coughin'.

1141
01:55:09,754 --> 01:55:11,585
Then l saw someone carrying Jem.

1142
01:55:11,674 --> 01:55:13,790
Who was it?

1143
01:55:18,234 --> 01:55:19,792
There he is, Mr Tate.

1144
01:55:20,634 --> 01:55:23,467
He can tell you his name.

1145
01:55:49,034 --> 01:55:50,387
Hey, Boo.

1146
01:55:52,794 --> 01:55:56,309
Miss Jean Louise,
Mr Arthur Radley.

1147
01:55:58,554 --> 01:56:01,432
I believe he already knows you.

1148
01:56:10,634 --> 01:56:12,943
Heck, let's go out
on the front porch.

1149
01:56:24,474 --> 01:56:27,830
Would you like to say good night
to Jem, Mr Arthur?

1150
01:56:50,074 --> 01:56:53,953
You can pet him, Mr Arthur.
He's asleep.

1151
01:56:54,034 --> 01:56:56,946
You couldn't if he was awake, though.
He wouldn't let you.

1152
01:57:00,994 --> 01:57:02,791
Go ahead.

1153
01:57:39,394 --> 01:57:41,828
Let's go sit in the swing,
Mr Arthur.

1154
01:57:48,834 --> 01:57:52,588
I guess the thing to do is--

1155
01:57:56,834 --> 01:58:00,509
Good Lord.
I must be losin' my memory.

1156
01:58:02,914 --> 01:58:07,351
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

1157
01:58:11,274 --> 01:58:14,027
Anyway, it'll have to...

1158
01:58:14,114 --> 01:58:16,469
come before the county court.

1159
01:58:19,514 --> 01:58:23,143
Of course, it's a clear-cut
case of self-defence.

1160
01:58:24,554 --> 01:58:26,351
I'll run down to the office--

1161
01:58:26,434 --> 01:58:28,026
Mr Finch...

1162
01:58:29,074 --> 01:58:31,349
do you think Jem
killed Bob Ewell?

1163
01:58:31,434 --> 01:58:33,584
Is that what you think?

1164
01:58:35,434 --> 01:58:37,584
Your boy never stabbed him.

1165
01:58:54,234 --> 01:58:56,668
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1166
01:58:57,994 --> 01:58:59,985
He killed himself.

1167
01:59:04,314 --> 01:59:07,112
There's a black man
dead for no reason.

1168
01:59:07,194 --> 01:59:10,630
Now the man responsible
for it is dead.

1169
01:59:10,714 --> 01:59:13,831
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr Finch.

1170
01:59:13,914 --> 01:59:16,223
I never heard tell it was
against the law for any citizen...

1171
01:59:16,314 --> 01:59:18,908
to do his utmost to prevent
a crime from being committed...

1172
01:59:18,994 --> 01:59:21,144
which is exactly what he did.

1173
01:59:21,234 --> 01:59:24,067
Maybe you'll tell me it's my duty
to tell the town all about it...

1174
01:59:24,154 --> 01:59:26,304
not to hush it up.

1175
01:59:26,394 --> 01:59:28,828
You know what'll happen then.

1176
01:59:28,914 --> 01:59:32,873
All the ladies in Maycomb, includin'
my wife, will be knockin' on his door...

1177
01:59:32,954 --> 01:59:35,263
bringin' angel food cakes.

1178
01:59:35,354 --> 01:59:38,312
To my way of thinkin',
takin' one man...

1179
01:59:38,394 --> 01:59:41,113
who done you and this town
a big service...

1180
01:59:41,194 --> 01:59:44,823
and draggin' him
with his shy ways into the limelight--

1181
01:59:45,914 --> 01:59:48,633
To me, that's a sin.

1182
01:59:48,714 --> 01:59:50,830
It's a sin.

1183
01:59:50,914 --> 01:59:53,587
And l'm not about
to have it on my head.

1184
01:59:54,914 --> 01:59:57,587
I may not be much, Mr Finch...

1185
01:59:57,674 --> 02:00:01,030
but l'm still sheriff
of Maycomb County...

1186
02:00:01,114 --> 02:00:04,072
and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1187
02:00:05,274 --> 02:00:07,105
Good night, sir.

1188
02:00:44,314 --> 02:00:46,703
Mr Tate was right.

1189
02:00:51,114 --> 02:00:53,753
What do you mean?

1190
02:00:53,834 --> 02:00:56,906
Well, it would be...

1191
02:00:56,994 --> 02:01:00,623
sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it?

1192
02:01:28,314 --> 02:01:30,145
Thank you, Arthur.

1193
02:01:37,754 --> 02:01:39,949
Thank you for my children.

1194
02:01:54,394 --> 02:01:57,386
Neighbours bring food
with death...

1195
02:01:57,474 --> 02:02:00,227
and flowers with sickness...

1196
02:02:00,314 --> 02:02:03,033
and little things in between.

1197
02:02:03,114 --> 02:02:05,628
Boo was our neighbour.

1198
02:02:05,714 --> 02:02:08,308
He gave us two soap dolls...

1199
02:02:08,394 --> 02:02:11,113
a broken watch and chain...

1200
02:02:11,194 --> 02:02:13,662
a knife...

1201
02:02:13,754 --> 02:02:15,631
and our lives.

1202
02:02:20,714 --> 02:02:24,309
One time Atticus said
you never really knew a man...

1203
02:02:24,394 --> 02:02:27,352
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

1204
02:02:32,954 --> 02:02:36,310
Just standin '
on the Radley porch was enough.

1205
02:02:43,354 --> 02:02:46,664
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended...

1206
02:02:46,754 --> 02:02:49,348
and another summer
had taken its place...

1207
02:02:49,434 --> 02:02:51,265
and a fall.

1208
02:02:51,354 --> 02:02:53,788
And Boo Radley had come out.

1209
02:02:57,754 --> 02:03:00,871
I was to think
of these days many times...

1210
02:03:00,954 --> 02:03:02,945
of Jem and Dill...

1211
02:03:03,034 --> 02:03:05,594
and Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.

1212
02:03:07,874 --> 02:03:09,751
And Atticus.

1213
02:03:17,754 --> 02:03:20,473
He would be in Jem's room
all night...

1214
02:03:21,594 --> 02:03:25,746
and he would be there
when Jem waked up in the morning.
