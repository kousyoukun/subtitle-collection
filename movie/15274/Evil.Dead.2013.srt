1
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,090
我們逮到她了
We caught the bitch.

2
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:28,274
請別傷害我
Please don't hurt me.

3
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,778
不要害怕  女孩
Don't be afraid, girl.

4
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,573
你是誰？
Who are you?

5
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:41,996
誰來救救我
Somebody please help me.

6
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:48,960
只有那本邪書能結束這一切
Only the evil book can undo what the evil book has done.

7
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,798
拜託，我只想回家
Please. I just want to go home.

8
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,803
拜託，我只想回家
Please. I just want to go home.

9
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,980
爸爸？
Daddy?

10
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,068
爸爸，你為何這麼做？
Daddy, why are you doing this to me?

11
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,945
他們是誰？
Who are these people?

12
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,363
他們是好人
Look, they are good people.

13
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,366
他們是來幫忙的
They are here to help.

14
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,368
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

15
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,453
媽媽呢？
Where's Mom?

16
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,206
媽媽死了，爸爸
Mommy's dead, baby.

17
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,624
你知道的
You know that.

18
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:32,714
你殺了她
You killed her.

19
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,965
什麼？
What?

20
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,216
真的
You did.

21
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,552
我沒有，你為何這麼說？
No, why are you saying these things?

22
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,721
爸爸  拜託，我只想回家
Daddy, please, I just want to go home.

23
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,180
我只是想回家
I just want to go home.

24
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:45,310
動手，只有這樣才能拯救她
Do it! It's the only way to save her soul!

25
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,981
我很抱歉，寶貝
I'm so sorry, baby.

26
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,983
爸爸，那是什麼？
Daddy, what is that?

27
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,991
爸爸
Daddy.

28
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,368
爸爸，看著我，是我啊
Daddy, look at me. It's me.

29
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,497
動手，讓你女兒解脫
Do it! Give your daughter peace!

30
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,250
我只想要你抱我，帶我回家
I just want you to hold me and take me home.

31
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,336
求你了！
Please.

32
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,259
拜託住手
Please stop.

33
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,181
我會撕碎你的靈魂
I will rip your soul out, Daddy.

34
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:29,520
我會吃掉你的靈魂，沒用的東西
I'll rip your soul out, you pathetic fuck!

35
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,274
混賬東西
Motherfucker!

36
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,110
我會殺了你，就像我殺掉…
I will kill you like I killed...

37
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,154
你的婊子
your whore!

38
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,369
干
Fuck!

39
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,955
干
Fuck!

40
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,173
寶貝，我愛你
I love you, baby.

41
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,141
最近忙什麼，大人物？
How's it going, Mr. Hot Shit City Boy?

42
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,143
- 嘿 ，奧利維亞   - 過來
- Hey, Olivia. - Come here.

43
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,145
用兩手，假裝你很想我
Two arms, please. Like you missed me.

44
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,566
這是我女友 娜塔莉
This is my girl Natalie.

45
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,860
你們車廠之花
Oh, the heartbreaker from your car shop.

46
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,153
你是醫生？
The doctor?

47
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,073
- 事實上她是… - 我是註冊護士
- Actually, she's... - I'm a registered nurse.

48
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,574
護士？
Nurse.

49
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,451
抱歉搞錯
Right, sorry.

50
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,912
你兩小時前就該到了
You were supposed to be here two hours ago, man.

51
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,247
那是萬人迷艾瑞克
And that's our irresistibly charming Eric.

52
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,917
教高中讓你產生負面心態？
Teaching high school finally turned you into a bitter old coot, huh?

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,960
不，是你
No, you did.

54
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,089
你讓我們苦等一個早上
You kept us waiting here all morning.

55
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,508
我也很高興見到你，過來
Good to see you, too, man. Come here.

56
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,844
你看起來不錯
You look good.

57
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,806
她在後面等著你
She's waiting for you in the back.

58
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,266
太好了
Great.

59
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:27,865
嘿  米亞
Hey, Mia.

60
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,035
我不敢相信
I'll be damned.

61
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,622
你真的來了
You actually came.

62
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,749
拜託　我是你哥
Come on, I'm your big brother.

63
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,709
我當然會來
Of course I came.

64
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,670
我知道我看起來很糟
I know I look like road kill.

65
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,756
不　你和以前一樣美
Oh, you look beautiful, as always.

66
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,135
你和以前一樣很會騙人
And you're a charming liar, as always.

67
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,139
爺爺？
Grandpa?

68
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,394
好久不見
Hey, there buddy.

69
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,064
我們最愛這堣F，對嗎？
We always loved this place, didn't we?

70
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,109
它很想你
He missed you a lot, you know.

71
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,489
- 噢  我的天   - 什麼？
- Oh, my God. - What?

72
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,950
- 那是什麼？ - 什麼？
- What is that? - What?

73
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,535
這個，這
Just this, right here. What are you...

74
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,247
這不好玩
It's not funny.

75
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,918
這是鼠李樹做的
This is, uh... It's made from a buckthorn tree.

76
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,004
可以讓你意志堅定
It's supposed to make your will stronger.

77
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,839
我以為你不信這些東西
But I thought you didn't believe in that kind of stuff.

78
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,426
我不信，但你相信，所以也許有用
I don't. But you do, so, well, maybe it'll work.

79
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,804
好吧
Okay.

80
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,057
那我們開始吧
Well, then, let's do this.

81
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,482
答應我　你會陪我到最後
Promise me you'll stay with me until the end.

82
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,859
我哪兒都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

83
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,110
你發誓
Cross your heart.

84
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,321
好吧
Okay.

85
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,115
我發誓
Hope to die.

86
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,162
好吧
Okay.

87
00:08:56,565 --> 00:09:00,450
在朋友和家人的見證之下
May my friends and family witness this act,

88
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,851
我真的下定決心要…
an irrevocable promise to my commitment that...

89
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,260
算了
Fuck it.

90
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:18,510
我發誓不碰這些東西…
I promise not to touch this shit...

91
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,978
再也不碰
ever again.

92
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,276
好了
Okay.

93
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,613
我們來戒毒吧
Let's play cold turkey.

94
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:40,665
嗯
Well...

95
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,376
我知道有些毒蟲今晚要開派對
I know some slugs are gonna have a party tonight.

96
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,586
大衛…
David...

97
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:49,507
米亞將要經歷她生命中最糟糕的三天
Mia's about to go through the worst three days of her life.

98
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,843
懂嗎？戒斷反應會讓她經歷極度的身體疼痛
Okay? Withdrawal's gonna make her experience extreme body pain,

99
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,554
嘔吐，冷顫，妄想癥…
vomiting, chills, paranoia...

100
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,014
這一點也不好
It's not gonna be nice.

101
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:58,325
為啥是三天？
Why three days?

102
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,908
因為三天之後…
Because after three days...

103
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:01,712
疼痛就消失了
the pain subsides.

104
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,021
她就會永遠擺脫麻煩
And she'll be off the hook for good.

105
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,649
米亞是很堅強的 她會沒事的
Mia's a strong girl. She'll be okay.

106
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,025
嗯
Yeah.

107
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,325
希望這還能用
Hopefully, this still works.

108
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,082
等一下
Wait.

109
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,054
好像有人進來過
Looks like someone broke in.

110
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,224
小心點
Be careful.

111
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,862
那是什麼味道？
What is that smell?

112
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,784
可能是年輕人來這媔摯s作樂
Some teenagers probably just broke in here to drink beer and bump uglies.

113
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,286
沒錯
Exactly.

114
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,773
媽媽要是看到一定氣壞了
Mom would have hated seeing the cabin like this.

115
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,191
好吧
Okay.

116
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,610
我們來整理一下
Let's make this place livable.

117
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,633
不 用我的相機
No, use my camera.

118
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:56,926
好吧 好吧
Fine, fine.

119
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,568
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

120
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,989
你記得媽媽唱的搖籃曲嗎？
Do you remember that lullaby Mom used to sing us?

121
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,492
歌詞好像是…
It was something like...

122
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,622
「我的寶貝，該說再見了」
"Baby, little baby, it's time to say goodbye.

123
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,085
「我的寶貝…」
"Baby, little baby..."

124
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,588
米亞，你現在不該想悲傷的回憶
Mia, please, I don't think you need sad memories in your head right now.

125
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,258
媽咪不是悲傷的回憶
Mom is not a sad one.

126
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,343
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

127
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,599
你知道嗎？她在醫院臨死前
You know what? Her final days at the hospital...

128
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:49,061
媽媽常以為我是你
Mom sometimes thought I was you.

129
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,400
有一次她一整天都叫我大衛
She even called me David for a whole day, once.

130
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,736
我順著他，因為…
And I played along, 'cause...

131
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,782
米亞，我也想去陪她，真的
Mia, look, I wanted to be there. Okay? I did.

132
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,076
但媽病情惡化時
But by the time Mom got bad,

133
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,662
我才剛找到芝加哥修車廠的工作
I had just gotten the job at the garage in Chicago.

134
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,542
我當時真的走不開
I don't know, I had a hard time finding the right moment to come back.

135
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,129
結果媽媽就過世了，所以…
And then it was too late. So...

136
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,355
也許你很幸運
Maybe you were lucky,

137
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,920
不用看到媽媽那樣
not to see her the way that I did.

138
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,215
她看起來還好
It looks like she's doing okay.

139
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,884
大衛，我有事要跟你說
David, there's something you need to know.

140
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,096
好吧
Okay.

141
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,683
我們去年夏天就做過一次
We already tried this whole thing back in Flint last summer.

142
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,770
米亞那時也發誓
Mia made the same promises.

143
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:14,619
她…
She...

144
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,440
同樣戲劇性地發誓要保持清醒
took the same dramatic vow of sobriety

145
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,151
然後把毒品丟掉
before chucking her dope down the toilet.

146
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,237
她戒了8小時然後放棄
She lasted eight hours and quit.

147
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,242
所以這次不能再給她機會
So, we don't want to give her that chance this time.

148
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,577
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

149
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,163
大衛，等她崩潰時…
David, when she breaks,

150
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,958
相信我，她會的
and believe me, she will,

151
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,002
我們不能讓她離開
we don't want to let her leave.

152
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,133
你要強迫她留在這堙H
What do you mean? You want force her to stay here?

153
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,468
米亞？
Mia?

154
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,305
這次只能來硬的
This time the only way is the hard way, man.

155
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,682
她經不起再次吸毒過量
She won't survive another OD.

156
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,808
什麼？
What?

157
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,519
米亞吸毒過量？
Mia OD'd?

158
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,146
不光吸毒過量
She didn't just OD.

159
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,148
按規定來說，你妹死了
Legally, your sister died.

160
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,818
醫生給她電擊才救活她
They had to defibrillate her.

161
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,448
天哪
Jesus.

162
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:11,453
我們的態度必須一致，不然沒用
Look, we all need to be together on this. Otherwise it won't work.

163
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,789
乖狗狗
Good boy.

164
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,001
我是來和我妹妹重修舊好的
I came here to make things better with my sister, not worse.

165
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,709
若她要我…
If she asks me to...

166
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,800
帶他回家，我會這麼做
take her home at some point, I'm gonna have to do it.

167
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,014
我受不了了！該死
I can't stand it! Fuck!

168
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,474
- 我受不了了  - 味道？什麼味道？
- I can't stand it! - Smell? What smell?

169
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,602
那是什麼鬼味道？
What the fuck is that smell?

170
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,103
我知道
I know, I know.

171
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,023
沒事的
It's okay. It's okay.

172
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,234
我再也受不了那個味道
I can't stand that fucking smell anymore.

173
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,486
躺下，好嗎？
Lie down, okay?

174
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,905
我們都在這堻郁A
We're all here for you. I know, I know.

175
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,160
我們都在這
We're all here.

176
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,870
我們都在這
We're all here.

177
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,040
我們不會離開
We're not going anywhere.

178
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,716
戒斷癥狀開始發作了
Withdrawal's kicking in hard.

179
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,010
這應該可以幫你度過今晚
This should help you get through the night.

180
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,472
不知道你們是怎麼回事
I don't know what is wrong with you people,

181
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:15,017
怎麼受得了那股屍臭味
but there is something dead and it reeks.

182
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,977
我沒聞到
But there is no smell.

183
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,687
你現在只是過度敏感
You're just extra-sensitive right now.

184
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:22,232
我受不了那個味道
I just can't stand that fucking smell anymore.

185
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,320
等一下
Wait.

186
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,081
那是血嗎？
Oh, is that blood?

187
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,473
該死
Oh, shit.

188
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,812
你還認為是我太敏感？
What's your medical diagnosis now?

189
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,605
真的好臭
It fucking stinks.

190
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,025
該死，小心
Shit. Careful.

191
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,777
樓梯都腐爛了
These steps are old and rotten.

192
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,071
就像這間房子一樣
Yeah, like this whole freaking house.

193
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,155
我知道
I know.

194
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:22,292
聞起來像頭髮燒焦
It smells like burnt hair.

195
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:24,920
好像是那後面
I think it's back there.

196
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,987
我的天
Oh, my God!

197
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,113
該死
Shit.

198
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,870
這是什麼？
What is this?

199
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,540
我不知道 我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

200
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,160
巫術？
Witchcraft?

201
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,167
誰會做這種事？
Who would do this?

202
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,506
有人在這媬N東西
Shit, something burned here.

203
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,011
你看
Look.

204
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,350
可惡
Shit, man.

205
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,978
這堨L媽發生了什麼？
What the fuck happened here?

206
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,314
我們不要過度反應，好嗎？
Let's not go crazy over this. Okay?

207
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,608
我等下會把死貓移走
I'll bury those dead cats out back later.

208
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,152
那些味道很快就會消失
Yeah. The smell will be gone in no time.

209
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,987
最好是
Yeah, okay.

210
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,949
那些巫毒的鬼玩意兒怎麼辦？
And what about the voodoo shit they did down there, huh?

211
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,453
不，巫毒用的是人偶那些東西
No, no, no. Voodoo is more about dolls and personal artifacts.

212
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,289
- 這不一樣了 - 艾瑞克，別說了
- This is something different. - Eric, that's enough.

213
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,669
你們不該碰那地下室的東西
You shouldn't have touched anything from that basement.

214
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,422
「納塔隆迪蒙多」
Naturom Demonic

215
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:47,766
「康達」
"Kunda."

216
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,400
「阿斯特塔」
"Astratta."

217
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,281
「蒙托賽」
"Montosse."

218
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,664
「康達」
"Canda."

219
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,596
老天，饒了我吧
Please, God, give me a break.

220
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,980
米亞
Mia.

221
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,285
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

222
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,038
抱歉，我現在必須離開這
I'm sorry, but I have to get out of here right now.

223
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,915
別鬧了，睡衣派對還沒結束
No, come on. The slumber party isn't over yet.

224
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,126
我們還沒玩「大風吹」，是嗎？
Yeah, we still haven't played "Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?

225
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,544
米亞，聽著
Mia, please look... Mia...

226
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,546
我快發瘋了
I'm going insane here.

227
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,758
奧利維亞  我覺得我快瘋了
Olivia, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

228
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,801
怎麼了？
Mia, what is it?

229
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,307
我這次真的會戒　好嗎？
I will go through with this, okay?

230
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,642
我只是…不能在這塈
I just... I can't do it here.

231
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,144
米亞
Mia...

232
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,023
我們說好不讓你回去
We've decided we're not gonna take you back.

233
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,987
我們不能再失去你
We can't lose you again.

234
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,031
你這次必須撐到最後
You're gonna have to stick it out this time.

235
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,994
大衛，載我回去
David, drive me home.

236
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,833
快點，大衛
Come on, David.

237
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,878
米亞 也許他們是對的
Mia, maybe they're right.

238
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,844
你應該支持我，不是他們
You were supposed to be here to support me, not them.

239
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,514
- 我是在支持你 米亞 所以我才來這 - 天哪
- I'm here for you, Mia. That's why I came. - Oh, my God.

240
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,516
我真是白癡
I'm such an idiot.

241
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,851
竟然笨到以為這次…
To think for once in my life,

242
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,312
我能依靠你
I could count on you.

243
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,776
米亞，我們只是想試著幫助你
Mia, we're just trying to help you.

244
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,861
不用了
Yeah, well, fuck you very much!

245
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,078
艾瑞克，讓她靜一靜
Eric, leave her alone.

246
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,413
米亞
Mia.

247
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,636
米亞
Mia!

248
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,682
太好了
Perfect.

249
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,810
干…
Fuck this. Fuck, fuck.

250
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,745
我到底在幹嘛？
What the fuck am I doing?

251
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:46,270
我到底在幹嘛？
What the fuck am I doing?

252
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,882
米亞
Mia!

253
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,803
- 米亞 - 米亞
- Mia! - Mia!

254
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,516
米亞
Mia.

255
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,689
米亞
Mia!

256
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:48,710
米亞
Mia.

257
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,763
米亞
Mia!

258
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:42,972
米亞
Mia!

259
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,641
米亞
Mia!

260
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,230
- 米亞  - 該死
- Mia! - Shit.

261
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,984
天哪
Oh, my God.

262
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,663
她怎麼樣了？
Hey, how's she doing?

263
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,999
她說樹林埵陪茪k的
Um, she's talking about a woman in the woods.

264
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,835
還說那些樹攻擊她
How the forest attacked her.

265
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,255
我不知道，應該只是戒斷癥狀
I don't know. It's just crazy withdrawal talk.

266
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:17,340
也許我們該帶她去醫院？
Well, don't you think we should take her to a hospital?

267
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,426
我也覺得情況有些失控
I feel like we're in over our heads here.

268
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,171
好
Okay.

269
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:23,510
我給她的治療和醫院一樣
I am giving her the exact same treatment she would get at a hospital.

270
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:30,270
若現在離開，一切都沒意義了
If we leave now, all of this mess will have been for nothing.

271
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,730
她手上的傷怎麼來的？
Okay. What about the wounds on her arms?

272
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,192
我拔出一些刺
I pulled some thorns out.

273
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,611
她應該是跑進有刺的樹林
It looks like she might've run into a thorn bush out there.

274
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,072
她可能是故意的
She probably did it on purpose.

275
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,116
什麼？
What?

276
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,035
大衛
David,

277
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,039
現在開始，她會想盡辦法離開
from now on, she is gonna do whatever it takes to get out of here.

278
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,601
米亞
Mia.

279
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,813
你該把衣服換掉
Listen, you've gotta get out of those clothes.

280
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,566
- 好嗎？去洗個澡   - 大衛
- All right? Take a shower. - David.

281
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,569
拜託
Please.

282
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,905
求求你
Please.

283
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,910
你必須帶我…
You have to get me...

284
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,329
離開這
...out of here.

285
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,625
沒人說戒毒很簡單
Mia, look, nobody said this was gonna be easy.

286
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:35,585
不
No.

287
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,256
你不瞭解
You don't understand.

288
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,469
大衛，樹林埵釭F西
There was something in the woods, David.

289
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:52,894
我覺得那東西…
And I think it's in here...

290
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,021
現在就在屋子
with us now.

291
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,983
在這屋堙H
With me in the room?

292
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,917
聽著，這只是你的幻覺
Look, you know it's all in your head.

293
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:18,628
試著撐過今晚
Just try to get it together.

294
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,216
明天就會好多了，好嗎？
You'll feel better tomorrow, okay?

295
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,218
你會感謝我們
You'll be glad we were such assholes.

296
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,639
好吧
Okay.

297
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:09,429
艾瑞克，你在幹什麼？
Eric, what are you doing?

298
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,681
不要在看那本書好嗎？
Please, would you just get rid of that thing?

299
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:14,851
你應該去地下室幫你朋友清理
You should be downstairs helping your friend clean up that mess.

300
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,520
我不知道你在說誰？
I don't know who you're talking about.

301
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,897
少假裝你不開心他
Come on. Don't act like you don't care about him.

302
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,358
我知道你關心
I know you do.

303
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,530
誰叫他過去幾年都不理我們
Well, I think we can all agree he hasn't cared about us for the past freaking century.

304
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,610
至少他來了
Well, he's here now.

305
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,038
是啊
Yeah.

306
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,540
真不可思議
Truly amazing.

307
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,491
爺爺？
Grandpa?

308
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,581
爺爺？
Grandpa!

309
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,589
爺爺？
Grandpa?

310
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,258
過來，狗狗
Come here, boy.

311
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,468
操
Fuck.

312
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:41,813
爺爺
Grandpa.

313
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,775
不  不  不
No,no,no.

314
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,028
狗狗，過來
Hey, boy. Come here.

315
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,538
怎麼回事？
What did you get into?

316
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,790
可惡
Fuck.

317
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,377
發生了什麼事？
What happened?

318
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,107
米亞？
Mia?

319
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,734
她在洗澡
She's in the shower.

320
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,486
發生了什麼事？大衛？
What happened? David?

321
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:33,906
米亞？
Mia?

322
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,826
米亞　開門
Mia, open the door.

323
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,873
米亞  開門
Hey, Mia, open the door.

324
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:43,958
米亞  開門！
Mia, open the door!

325
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,918
大衛  你在幹嘛？
David, what are you doing?

326
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,465
大衛，告訴我怎麼回事
David, stop, tell me what's going on.

327
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,342
米亞  把門打開！
Mia! Mia, open the fucking door!

328
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,516
米亞
Mia?

329
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,685
米亞  把門打開！
Mia, open the fucking door!

330
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,562
大衛！
David!

331
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,190
大衛！
David!

332
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,650
住手！
Stop it!

333
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,277
米亞
Mia!

334
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,783
米亞？
Mia?

335
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:19,827
米亞？
Mia?

336
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:23,623
奧利維亞
Olivia!

337
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,460
天哪
Holy shit!

338
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,128
米亞
Mia!

339
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,266
可惡
Shit.

340
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,894
太誇張了
This is insane.

341
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,611
可惡，在哪堙H
Fuck. Where is it?

342
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,639
怎麼可能
This can't be happening.

343
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,000
我 ..嗯... 我 ..
I, um... I...

344
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,253
我給她打針讓她睡一、兩小時
I gave her a sedative. So, she should be out for a couple of hours.

345
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:56,560
他傷勢嚴重，大概…
But, fuck, her burns are serious. Like,

346
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,604
二、三級灼傷
second, third degree.

347
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:00,305
這不該發生
This is so wrong.

348
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,220
誰知道她會做這種事
Well, nobody could have known she would do something so twisted!

349
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:04,223
不  你應該知道
No, you should have known!

350
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,434
我們到這兒後都聽你的指示
We've all been following your lead since we got here.

351
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,146
米亞要走時　我們就該離開的
We should have left when Mia wanted to.

352
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:13,983
寶貝，別這樣，我們不要慌
Baby, please! Okay? Let's not lose our heads, okay?

353
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,819
幸運的話，雨再幾小時就會停
Look, with any luck, it'll stop raining in a couple of hours,

354
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,195
明天早上就能過河
and we'll be able to cross the creek in the morning,

355
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,864
帶她去醫院
and we'll take her to a hospital.

356
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,408
好嗎？一切都會沒事
Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

357
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,286
「一切都會沒事」？
"Everything's gonna be fine?"

358
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,831
一切都會沒事
Everything's gonna be fine.

359
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,337
你大概沒注意到每件事都不對勁
I don't know if you've noticed this, but nothing has been fine.

360
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:38,591
而且每況愈下，越來越糟
And everything's been getting worse every second.

361
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,765
米亞？
Mia?

362
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,066
米亞？
Mia?

363
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,944
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

364
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,325
米亞  把槍放下
Mia, put the gun down.

365
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:06,994
拜託把槍放下
Put the gun down, please.

366
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,293
米亞
Mia.

367
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,629
把那該死的槍放下
Put the fucking gun down!

368
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,639
去死吧
Die!

369
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,395
我會把你們一個一個解決
One by one, we will take you!

370
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,317
你們今晚都要受死
You are all going to die tonight.

371
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,074
去拿槍，快
The gun. The gun, quick!

372
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,118
寶貝？
Baby?

373
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,055
米亞？
Mia!

374
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,861
放我出去！

375
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:22,820
- 讓我出去！ - 她真的瘋了
- Let me out! - She's totally psychotic.

376
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,031
我的天，她眼睛怎麼了？
Oh, my God, what happened to her eyes?

377
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,334
她在做什麼？
What's she doing?

378
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,378
聽起來像在撞東西
it sounds like she's hitting herself against something.

379
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,963
不可能
This is impossible.

380
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,549
我給她的劑量能讓馬睡著
I just gave her enough sedative to put a horse to sleep.

381
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,342
再給她一針
Give her another shot!

382
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,262
那會讓她陷入昏迷
That could put her into a coma.

383
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,723
她就快撞死自己了
For Christ's sakes, Olivia, she's gonna kill herself down there!

384
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,684
快去拿藥
Go get the shot!

385
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,396
我必須把彈殼取出來
I gotta get the shrapnel out of my arm.

386
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,482
我包埵酗p夾子
What? I have tweezers in my purse.

387
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,194
大衛  聽我說
David. Listen to me.

388
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,655
我覺得給她鎮定劑沒用
I don't think a tranquilizer's gonna do shit.

389
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:11,285
因為我們不是在處理恐慌癥
'Cause I don't think we're dealing with a freaking panic attack here!

390
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,579
我覺得米亞會這樣
I'm scared that what's happening to Mia has something to do

391
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,040
和地下室的東西有關
with the fucking witchcraft in the basement!

392
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:40,624
奧利維亞
Olivia!

393
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:51,969
奧利維亞？
Olivia?

394
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:15,826
奧利維亞？
Olivia?

395
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,495
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

396
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,129
奧利維亞？
Olivia?

397
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,488
奧利維亞，你在堶捧F嘛？
Olivia, what are you doing in there?

398
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:57,993
奧利維亞
Olivia.

399
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,331
奧利維亞？
Olivia.

400
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,170
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

401
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,969
天哪
Oh, my God!

402
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:17,680
你幹嘛這樣？
Why the fuck did you do that?

403
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:41,704
殺了他
Kill him.

404
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:21,577
不
No!

405
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,882
她想殺我
She tried to kill me.

406
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:37,051
她想殺我
She tried to kill me.

407
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,402
可惡
Fuck.

408
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,115
壓好，可以嗎？
You hold that. You got it?

409
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:13,587
壓住這
Hold it there, okay? Hold it there. Hold...

410
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:15,422
可惡
Fuck it.

411
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:19,774
大衛
David,

412
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,897
我做了很糟的事
I did something terrible.

413
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,557
我相信你不是故意的
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her.

414
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,769
我殺的東西不是奧利維亞
That thing I killed was not Olivia.

415
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:30,187
他失血過多
He's losing too much blood.

416
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,980
寶貝　他需要水和糖
Baby, he needs water and sugar. Okay?

417
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,107
去啊
Go.

418
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:34,858
快去
Go!

419
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:36,151
好 好
Okay. Okay.

420
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,115
- 好了  - 大衛
- All right. - David.

421
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,036
我念了那本書上的字
I read a passage from that book.

422
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,039
這是… 這是某種禱告
It was... It was some sort of prayer.

423
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:52,167
我釋放了某些東西
I released something, David.

424
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:57,881
我釋放了邪惡的東西
I released something evil.

425
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:00,611
娜塔莉？
Natalie?

426
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:10,829
米亞嗎？
Mia?

427
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,874
娜塔莉
Natalie.

428
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,756
我為何在地下室？
What am I doing down here?

429
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,551
我的腳好痛
My leg hurts.

430
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,096
我不能動
I can't move.

431
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:34,144
我要下來了，好嗎？
I'm gonna come down there, okay?

432
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,982
你們為何把我鎖在這堙H
Why did you lock me down here?

433
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,860
你們應該幫我才對
You were supposed to help me.

434
00:47:41,944 --> 00:47:44,571
我們是在試著幫你
Hey, we're trying to help you, okay?

435
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:48,283
你失控了，你知道嗎？
You were out of control, you know?

436
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:51,411
你變得很暴力，我們不知如何是好
You got violent and we didn't know what else to do.

437
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:56,542
米亞，剛發生很恐怖的事
Mia, look, something really terrible has happened

438
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,544
我們必須離開這
and we have to get out of here now. Okay?

439
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:01,880
你不懂
You don't understand.

440
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,298
他不會讓你離開
He's not gonna let you leave!

441
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:07,344
除非他得到你
And he's not gonna stop till he has you.

442
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:10,389
除非他得到所有人
Until he has all of you!

443
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:16,872
拜託…
Please...

444
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:24,880
我聞得到你骯髒的靈魂
I can smell your filthy soul.

445
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,708
親我，你這賤貨
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

446
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,188
帥哥，下來讓我吸你的屌
Why don't you come down here, so I can suck your cock, pretty boy!

447
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:24,648
米亞
Mia.

448
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,525
米亞不在這堙A你這白癡
Mia's not here, you fucking idiot!

449
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,612
你妹妹正在地獄被強姦
Your little sister is being raped in hell!

450
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,964
家 我要回家
Home. I want to go home.

451
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,620
謝謝你的水
Thanks for the water.

452
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,674
艾瑞克
Eric.

453
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:37,053
我以為這樣可以結束一切
I don't know why, but I thought this would end it.

454
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:42,893
但這本書燒不起來
But this book does not burn.

455
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:47,439
它燒不起來
It does not fucking burn.

456
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:53,028
告訴我怎麼回事
Tell me what's going on here.

457
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,002
這本書是用….
This book uses some

458
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:12,380
（你將受苦）
ancient alphabet.

459
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,300
堶惘酗@些翻譯，但…
There's some translations, but...

460
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,260
很零星
Just scattered notes.

461
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:20,430
它們全都指向…
They all refer to some...

462
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,266
一種邪惡的東西
Evil entity.

463
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,228
奪取靈魂的…
A taker of souls.

464
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:29,231
惡魔
A demon.

465
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,316
上面說…
It says...

466
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:36,154
「等他吞噬五條靈魂」
"Once he feasts on five souls,

467
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:40,158
「天空會再下血，惡魔…」
"the sky will bleed again and the abomination

468
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:42,536
「會從地域升起」
"will rise from Hell."

469
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,709
太荒唐了
This is insane.

470
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,391
這東西…
This thing...

471
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:35,380
像水蛭緊附在米亞的靈魂
is attached to Mia's soul like a leech.

472
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,132
它變成她
It's becoming her.

473
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,493
若要停止一切
If we want to stop this,

474
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:42,189
若要救米亞…
if we want to help Mia...

475
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:52,060
我想我們必須殺了她
I think we're gonna have to kill her.

476
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,858
你說什麼？
What did you say?

477
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:56,067
上面寫…
Everything says...

478
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:58,653
艾瑞克，我們不要殺人
Eric! We're not gonna fucking kill anybody!

479
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:01,114
你有沒有聽到自己說的話？
Are you listening to yourself?

480
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:04,993
也許是地下室那些死貓
What about those dead cats down in the basement?

481
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,912
也許它們有病毒
I mean, maybe they had some disease.

482
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,247
害米亞感染
I mean, some virus that... It spread to Mia,

483
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,584
然後她吐的時候又傳染給奧利維亞
and then she passed it to Olivia when she puked all over her face!

484
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,339
那種病毒…
But what kind of a virus...

485
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:18,210
會讓人拿玻璃割自己的臉？
makes a person cut off their face with a piece of glass?

486
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:23,762
天哪
Oh, God. Oh, God.

487
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:41,363
我不知道我們面對的是什麼
I don't know what we're dealing with here, okay?

488
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:43,973
但等雨一停
But it stopped raining,

489
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:46,580
等幾個小時 水位就會下降
and in a couple of hours, the river will be clear,

490
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,091
我們就能離開這
and we're gonna get out of this place.

491
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:49,632
我們所有人
All of us.

492
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:53,124
到哪堥瓣ㄜ垠n
It doesn't matter where we go.

493
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:55,943
若現在不採取行動
If we don't do something right now,

494
00:54:56,091 --> 00:54:58,719
到時候我們都會死
we're all gonna be dead by then!

495
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,150
還給我…
Give me back...

496
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:21,152
我的手
my hand.

497
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:24,155
我們要來抓你了
We're gonna get you

498
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,367
別再偷看了
Not another peep

499
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,495
該睡覺了
Time to go to sleep

500
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,038
睡吧
Sleep.

501
00:55:32,122 --> 00:55:33,707
睡吧 睡吧
Sleep. Sleep.

502
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:51,933
住手，賤人，不准割
Don't do it, you little bitch! Don't cut it off!

503
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:02,527
不准割
Don't cut it off!

504
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,778
去你的
FUCK you!

505
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,163
不…
No, no, no, no, no...

506
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:16,666
不 不！
No, no, no...

507
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:43,693
我必須要做 而且現在我感覺好多了
I had to do it. And I feel much better now.

508
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,751
等等，寶貝，請等一下
Hold on, baby. Hold on, please.

509
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:03,296
艾瑞克和我打算阻止這一切，好嗎？
Eric and I are gonna put a stop to this, okay?

510
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,091
我保證一切都會沒事
I promise that everything's gonna be fine.

511
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:07,884
好嗎，寶貝？
Okay? Okay, baby?

512
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,012
她把她的手切掉
She just cut her fucking arm off.

513
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:13,765
這樣叫沒事？
Does that sound fine?

514
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:27,028
這些文字混亂
These inscriptions are confusing,

515
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:29,030
有時相互矛盾
sometimes contradictory,

516
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:31,074
但有件事是一致的
but they're consistent about one thing.

517
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,198
要停止這一切
In order to stop this,

518
00:57:34,423 --> 00:57:36,870
必須淨化被附身者
the possessed must be cleansed.

519
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:39,290
要淨化
Purified.

520
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,585
這本書提到三個方法
The book describes three specific ways.

521
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,631
活埋
A live burial.

522
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,258
活埋
A live burial.

523
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,221
肢解
Bodily dismemberment.

524
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,473
肢解
Bodily dismemberment.

525
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,563
還有火燒淨化
And purification by fire.

526
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:07,360
你確定這有用嗎？
Are you sure this will work?

527
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:10,864
如果我們…
If we...

528
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,120
殺了我妹妹，她就會得到安息？
If I kill my sister, she'll be at peace?

529
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:21,374
我確定嗎？當然不
Am I... Am I sure? Of course not.

530
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:23,001
這又不是科學實驗
This is not a science book!

531
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,296
但我能確定一件事
But look, I'm sure of one thing.

532
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,761
米亞體內的東西…
Whatever is inside Mia...

533
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:30,630
就是這一切的根源
is the cause of all this.

534
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,788
她死了
If she dies,

535
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:34,670
那東西才會死
then this thing is gonna die with her.

536
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,723
要是她只是瘋了呢？
What if she just lost her mind?

537
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,935
也許她只是需要看醫生？
What if she just needs a doctor?

538
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,604
什麼？醫生？
What? A doctor?

539
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,567
我媽媽死在精神病院，她瘋了
My mom died in a mental hospital. She was crazy.

540
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:50,570
她喪失心智，成了野獸
She was deranged, she was a monster.

541
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:55,241
我一直很怕米亞和我會像她一樣
I've always feared that me and Mia would end up like her.

542
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:58,536
那好吧，米亞已經瘋了
So... Okay, so Mia went crazy.

543
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,289
那奧利維亞呢？娜塔莉呢？
Okay. What about Olivia? What about Natalie?

544
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:04,792
也許我們都瘋了
Maybe we've all gone crazy.

545
00:59:14,928 --> 00:59:17,472
你只是個膽小鬼
You're just a fucking coward.

546
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,184
你知道我們該怎麼做
You know exactly what we have to do,

547
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:24,312
但你害怕到不敢去做
but you're too scared to go through with it.

548
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:27,482
我要放火把這媬N了
I'm gonna burn this fucking place down.

549
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,984
好結束這場惡夢
And I'm gonna end this nightmare.

550
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:34,030
你乾脆逃走好了
Why don't you just run away?

551
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:38,034
去找個地方躲起來
Go hide beneath some rock somewhere.

552
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:40,453
這你最在行了
You know you're great at that.

553
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,044
可惡
Oh, shit.

554
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,872
她跑哪去了？
Where the fuck did she go?

555
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:08,249
大衛
David.

556
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,336
先去拿那把槍
Take it before she does.

557
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:46,079
想玩嗎 小不點？
Want to play, little man?

558
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:50,458
不
No!

559
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,212
站住
Stop!

560
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,139
不…
No,no,no!

561
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,142
不  不  不！
No, no, no...

562
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,675
大衛
David.

563
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,226
你為什麼要傷害我？
Why are you hurting me?

564
01:02:58,276 --> 01:03:00,153
我的臉好痛
My face hurts.

565
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:03,364
為什麼？
Why?

566
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:07,452
為什麼我的臉好痛？
Why... Why does my face hurt?

567
01:03:10,455 --> 01:03:11,622
寶貝
Baby.

568
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,542
小娜
Nat.

569
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:52,288
撐著點，到了
Come on. Come on, man. Here we are.

570
01:03:56,751 --> 01:03:58,961
撐著點
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

571
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,589
不要死，拜託
Don't die on me, please!

572
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,551
現在死掉也不錯
Dying wouldn't be so bad right now.

573
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:11,349
我不想被惡魔附身
I just don't want to become the devil's bitch.

574
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:17,271
我會做我該做的事
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

575
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,943
我會做該做的事，好嗎？
I'm gonna do what I gotta do. Okay?

576
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:08,299
抱歉，米亞
I'm sorry, Mia.

577
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:10,593
我愛你
I love you.

578
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,223
「我的寶貝」

579
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,727
「該說再見了」

580
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:24,398
「我的寶貝」

581
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:28,152
「我每天都會想你」

582
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:31,781
「我的寶貝」

583
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:35,701
「我每天都會寫信給你」

584
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:40,247
「寶貝，別哭」

585
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:44,335
「我希望我能留下「
I wish that I could stay

586
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:46,587
我下不了手
I can't do this.

587
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:51,217
我沒辦法
I can't do this.

588
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:29,046
這次只能來硬的
This time, the only fucking way is the hard way!

589
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:12,047
大衛

01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:15,551
兇手
Murderer.

591
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:18,846
懦夫
Coward.

592
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:22,303
艾瑞克
Eric.

593
01:10:42,763 --> 01:10:44,557
嘿  你還好嗎？

594
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:47,828
大衛

595
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,290
我很想你  夥計
I missed you, man.

596
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:58,005
你知道的，兄弟
You know that, buddy.

597
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:19,420
大衛？
David?

598
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,340
大衛？
David?

599
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:27,052
我動不了，我不能呼吸
I can't move! I can't breathe!

600
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:29,304
大衛

601
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,598

603
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:34,768
大衛，救我
Help me, David!

604
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:36,270
你不是她
You're not her.

605
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:38,355
大衛！
David!

606
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:39,440

你不是她！
You're not her!

608
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,284
你為什麼恨我，大衛？
Why do you hate me, David?

609
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,913
我知道你恨我
I know you do.

610
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,250
你離開家
You left home.

611
01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:03,457
把媽媽丟給我一個人
You left me all alone with our sick mother.

612
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:05,591
而我只是一個孩子
And I was just a kid.

613
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:08,844
你害我撒謊
You made me lie.

614
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:12,890
每次她尖叫你的名字
Every time she screamed your name,

615
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:15,184
我只能騙她說你在路上了
I told her you were coming to see her.

616
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:17,644
就像你答應的
Like you promised.

617
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:20,981
但你從沒回來過
But you never did.

618
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:25,486
拜託別說了，我求你
Please stop it, I'm begging you.

619
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:28,697
我知道現在媽媽恨你
I know Mother hates you now,

620
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:32,117
她在地獄等你
and she waits for you in hell.

621
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:42,294
閉嘴
Shut up.

622
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:43,837
你會燒死的，大衛
You will burn, David.

623
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,883
你會和你那吸毒的妹妹一起燒死在地獄
You will burn in hell alongside your junkie sister.

624
01:13:48,092 --> 01:13:49,301
閉嘴
Shut up.

625
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:53,847
你想殺我，就會被燒死在地獄，你這個混蛋！
You're gonna burn in hell for trying to kill me, you motherfucker!

626
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:12,533
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

627
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,122
我應該回家的
I should have been there.

628
01:14:20,124 --> 01:14:22,709
我應該回家陪你的
I should've been there for you.

629
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:19,892
拜託回來
Come on. Please, come back.

630
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:26,356
快 快 快

631
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,859
米亞，快回來

632
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,738
你安息吧
Okay, you are at peace.

633
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,116
你現在是在和平
You're at peace now.

634
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:45,852
大衛？
David?

635
01:16:52,526 --> 01:16:53,777
米亞？
Mia?

636
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,369
好可怕

637
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:06,540
真的好可怕
It was so horrible.

638
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:10,377
好了，沒事了
It's okay. It's all over now.

639
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:16,883
謝謝你沒離開我
Thanks for not leaving me, David.

640
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:27,602
在這媯央A我去拿車鑰匙
Wait here. I'm gonna get the car keys.

641
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:30,397
- 好嗎？ - 好
- Okay? - Yeah.

642
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:36,129
大衛

643
01:18:36,213 --> 01:18:38,090
- 走，快走  - 不 不
- Go. Please, go. - No, no, no.

644
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:39,424
去！
Go!

645
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:42,636
我不要走，我不走
I'm not gonna go anywhere. I'm not going anywhere.

646
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,142
鑰匙拿著，我們走
Mia, take the keys. Look at me, let's go.

647
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:50,811
快點，我們走
Come on. Come on, let's go.

648
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,026
快走
Get out of here.

649
01:18:59,403 --> 01:19:01,696
不
No! No!

650
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:03,824
大衛

651
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:06,493
大衛

他要來了
He's coming.

655
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:32,407
米亞
Mia.

656
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:32,967

657
01:24:58,386 --> 01:24:59,637
快點
Come on.

658
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:00,240
你會死在這，沒用的毒蟲
You're gonna die here, you pathetic junkie!

659
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:04,619
我受夠了
I've had enough of this shit.

660
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:47,745
我要吃掉你的靈魂
I will feast on your soul.

661
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:53,376
吃這個，王八蛋
Feast on this, motherfucker!

662
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:07,181
去死吧！
Die!

663
01:27:28,328 --> 01:27:30,330
回到地獄吧，婊子！
Go back to Hell, bitch.

664
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,002
你還好嗎 孩子？
Are you okay, kiddo?

665
01:31:48,129 --> 01:31:49,380
救救我
Help me.

666
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:53,926
全能的上帝
God Almighty.

667
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,014
別擔心，孩子
Don't you worry, kid.

668
01:31:58,097 --> 01:32:01,225
我帶你去醫院，你會很快得到救治
I'm taking you to the hospital, and they'll patch you up in no time.

669
01:32:01,309 --> 01:32:02,768
你會恢復健康的
You'll be right as rain.

670
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:42,219
我確信在康達堥廢墟有了驚人發現
I believe I have made a significant find in the Candarian Ruins...

671
01:34:42,303 --> 01:34:47,058
有一本關於古蘇美人喪葬的書
A volume of ancient Sumerian burial practices and funerary incantations.

672
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:50,519
書名"納塔隆迪蒙多"
It is entitled "Naturom Demonto."

673
01:34:50,603 --> 01:34:53,356
意思是"死亡之書"
Roughly translated, "Book of the Dead."

674
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:55,573
這本書用人皮作封面
The book is bound in human flesh

675
01:34:55,816 --> 01:34:57,690
用人血書寫
and inked in human blood.

676
01:34:57,777 --> 01:35:01,072
是關於惡魔復活
It deals with demons, demon resurrection,

677
01:35:01,155 --> 01:35:05,117
在森林遊蕩的黑暗勢力
those forces which roam the forest and dark bowers of man's domain.

678
01:35:06,219 --> 01:35:09,454
前幾頁警告說這些不朽的生物…
The first few pages warn that these enduring creatures

679
01:35:09,487 --> 01:35:12,120
看起來死了 但絕不會死
may lie dormant, but are never truly dead.

680
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:17,463
這本書上的咒語可讓他們復活
They may be recalled to active life through the incantations presented in this book.

681
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:20,091
只要唸咒語就給了惡魔通行證
It is through recitation of these passages

682
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:23,969
來奪取人的靈魂
that the demons are given license to possess the living.

683
01:35:57,753 --> 01:36:00,506
我看到黑影在森林堬劓
I have seen the dark shadows moving in the woods,

684
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:04,427
我相信被我召喚出的東西
and I have no doubt that whatever I have resurrected through this book

685
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:07,847
已經來找我了
is sure to come calling for me.

686
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:20,359
酷啊
Groovy.
