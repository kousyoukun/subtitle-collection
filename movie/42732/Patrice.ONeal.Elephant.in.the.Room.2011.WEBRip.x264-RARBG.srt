182
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,767
YOU DID.

183
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,400
YOU GAVE IT A TWO-YEAR SHOT.

00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,233
LIKE, "OH, YEAH, I TRIED.

BUT YOU--
IT'S NOT--

187
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,400
IT'S NOT--IT'S JUST F--

00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,200

AND I'MA TELL YOU SOMETHING
YOU DON'T KNOW

190
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,833
ABOUT BLACK FOLKS.

191
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,800
WE WOULD BE ON YOUR SIDE,

00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,333
UH, YOU KNOW,

00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,567
IF YOU WOULD, UH,

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,067
JUST NOT EVER TALK
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL

196
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,833
ABOUT ANYTHING RACIAL.

197
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:34,867
WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU.

198
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,400

199
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,800
'CAUSE BLACK PEOPLE

200
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,533

00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,700
BUT IT'S TOO MANY
WHITE PEOPLE

202
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,067
OUTWARDLY HATING HIM,

203
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,467

"IF YOU SHUT THE FUCK--

204
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,533
IF YOU SHUT UP,
I'LL BE YOUR GANGSTA."

205
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,733
I'M LIKE, "STOP--
STOP HAVING RALLIES

206
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,167

209
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,433
A WHITE SLAVE BY NOW.

210
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,067
I THOUGHT--

211
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I THOUGHT IT WAS
VENGEANCE DAY.

212
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,700
THOUGHT I'D HAVE ME
A WHITE FAMILY.

213
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,700
BIG OL' FAT WHITE GIRL

00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,067
"AND STARE YOUR HUSBAND
IN THE FACE

219
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:25,900

220
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,900
"NOW, YOU KNOW
YOUR WIFE'S UPSTAIRS,

221
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:29,967

PH--PH--PHILLIP."

224
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,500
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE,
ISN'T IT?

225
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,733
THAT'S UNCOM--
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

226
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,567
I APOLOGIZE.
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,933
CAN'T WE MOVE ON?

228
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:47,733
WE'LL MOVE ON.
WE'LL MOVE ON TO SOMETHIN'.

229
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,367
THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE THAT
IN PLAY.

230
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,600
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE, RIGHT?

231
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,733
TO THINK ABOUT THAT?

232
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,700
BUT YOU KNOW.

233
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,967

SO I JUST WANNA HAVE
AS MUCH FUN AS POSSIBLE,

237
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,833

AND THAT'S--THAT'S--

00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,633
THAT'S YOUNG
IN EVERYONE ELSE YEARS.

241
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,133
BUT, UH, IN BLACK YEARS--

242
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:15,700
I GOT, YOU KNOW,
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

243
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,867
DIABETES.

244
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,733
I AM, UH--

245
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:23,500
IF YOU DO THE BLACK-TO-WHITE
LIFE RATIO,

00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:27,833
I'M A HUNDRED...

247
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:32,333
AND SEVENTY-SEVEN YEAR OLD.

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,833
I'M OLD AS A MOTHERFU--

249
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:41,967
I'M OLD.

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,633
AND I WANNA LIVE,

251
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,067
BUT HERE'S WHERE
I MESSED UP.

252
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,800
I MESSED UP MY YOUNG YEARS.

253
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,033
AND I REALIZED SOMETHING.

254
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,933
I'MA TELL YOU,
IF YOU'RE OVER 40,

255
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,800

YOU'RE NOT GONNA

259
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,700
AND WHEN I SAY

260
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BETTER YOURSELF,

261
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,233
I MEAN BETTER YOURSELF
LIKE GO BACK TO WHEN--

262
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:06,167

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,900
WHEN YOU SUPPOSED
TO HAD DID IT,

264
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,267
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

265
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,267

266
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,633

NOW YOU'RE 40,
AND YOU'RE GOING,

269
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,833

00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,567

00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,067
[geezer voice]
"YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO--

276
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,200
NEVER TOO OLD,
AND NEVER TOO BL-BL-BL."

277
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,267
WHOLE BUNCH OF SAYINGS.

278
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,233
[babbling incoherently]

279
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:42,400

00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:44,933
'CAUSE IT AIN'T--

YOU'RE OLD.

283
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,133
YOUR BRAIN DON'T WORK.

284
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,667
YOUR BODY DON'T WORK.

285
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,200
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
YOUR ETHIC.

286
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,767
THERE MIGHT BE
TWO OF YOU

287
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,067
THAT CHANGED YOUR ETHIC.

288
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,900
LIKE THESE FAT PEOPLE SHOWS
THAT ARE ON TV.

289
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,333
WHERE THEY GOT PEOPLE,
"UUGGGH."

290
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,833
SOON AS THAT SHOW
IS OVER,

291
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,300
THEY'RE FAT AGAIN.

292
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,267
BIG FAT FATS.

293
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,900
FATTY, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

294
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,300
I WENT TO EXERCISE RECENTLY,

295
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,900
AND I TRIED TO CHANGE
MY LIFE

296
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,333
AND EXERCISE.

297
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,933
AFTER I FINISHED,
I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF,

298
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:23,533
"I GOTTA DO THIS TOMORROW?"

299
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,400
LIKE, NOTHING CHANGED.

300
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:26,600
I STILL GOT S--
A LUMP.

301
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,233
I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT WAS.

302
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,633
SOMETHING SHOULDA CHANGED.

303
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,767
NOTHING.

304
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,933
AND I GOTTA KEEP DOING THIS

305
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:36,233
UNTIL MAYBE I SEE
A CHANGE.

306
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,233
I JUST CAN'T.

307
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,767
I DON'T HAVE
THAT ETHIC ANYMORE.

308
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,933
I SHOULDA DID IT
WHEN I WAS 18 YEARS OLD.

309
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:45,467
LIKE, I CAN'T TYPE.

310
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,667
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT TYPING WAS

311
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,900
TILL RIGHT NOW.

312
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:54,567
I FUCKED UP
ALL MY GOOD TYPING YEARS

313
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,767
CALLING PEOPLE GAY

314
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,100
WHO WAS GOING
TO TYPING CLASS.

315
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,567
IT WAS, LIKE,

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,700

00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,867

320
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,300
"MAN, MAN,

00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,167
LET'S GO, UH, STEAL BREAD."

322
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,533
WE USED TO GO STEAL BREAD
AND LUNCHMEAT

323
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,633
FROM THE SUPERMARKET

324
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,067
AND MAKE SANDWICHES
AND SELL 'EM

325
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,967
DURING TYPING CLASS.

326
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:27,600
AND NOW I CAN'T TYPE.

327
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,500
IF YOU CAN'T TYPE,

328
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,500
AND YOU TRY TO BE
IN A WORLD

329
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,533
WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN,

330
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,133
YOU--YOU--
YOU FEEL IRRELEVANT.

331
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,933
YOU STOP, YOU KNOW?

332
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,067

ON THE INTERNET.

333
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,200
"HI."

334
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,933
AND SHE COME BACK
WITH THE SEVEN-PAGE MEMO.

335
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,833
LIKE, "HELLO," WHAP!

YOU SAW ME TYPE, "HELLO."

339
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,567
AND I YELLED IT,
EVIDENTLY.

340
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,067
I--IN BIG LETTERS,
IT WAS SAYING HELLO.

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,900
REALLY, SERIOUSLY,

342
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,133
"HELLO! HIIII, BITCH!

343
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,233
HIIIII!"

344
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,533
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
I DID, FOR REAL?

345
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,700
YEAH, REALLY?

346
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,167
JUST SEND SMILEY FACES,

LIKE, I CAN'T SPELL--

351
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,600
IF I HAD TO SPELL RESTAURANT,

00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,300
SOMETIMES.

526
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,000
SOMETIMMMMES.

534
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,733
AT THE JOB.

535
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,867
IT'S UNFAIR
THAT I CAN'T HARASS YOU

536
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,233
AT THE WORKPLACE.

537
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:17,300

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,833

LIKE, YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL
JUST TO SAY,

542
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,567
"HEY, YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL TODAY."

543
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,833
THAT'S HOW MESSED UP
THE GAME IS.

544
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,433
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO COMMENT

545
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:34,433
ON ANY PART OF THE BODY

546
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,633
THAT YOU SEE.

547
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,433
IF YOU--

548
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,367
I'M SERIOUS.

549
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,933
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,100
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

551
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,533
JEANNIE.
NOW, JEANNIE, NO DISRESPECT.

552
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,300
BUT IF I WORK
WITH YOU,

553
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,367
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO WALK IN AND GO,

554
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,567
"OH, JEANNIE, BEAUTIFUL, UH,

555
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,767
TITTY MEAT
YOU HAVE THERE."

556
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
AND--

557
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,800
'CAUSE I SEE THAT.

558
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,667
BUT WHATEVER
THE SCIENTIFIC TERM IS--

559
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,100
I'M LOOKING AT MR. F--

FOR, UH, T--THE TITTY MEAT.

WHAT'S THE ACTUAL--

564
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,100
AND IT'S NOT THE CLEAVAGE.

565
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,067
I MEAN, THE CLEAVAGE IS
THE SPACE IN THE MIDDLE.

566
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:18,267
I'M TALKING 'BOUT THE MEAT.

567
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,067

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

571
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:35,067
JUST SO I CAN GO
THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY

572
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,067
WITHOUT PRETENDING...

573
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,133

00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,367
HAVING WOMEN WORK
WITH MEN, RIGHT,

578
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,467
IS LIKE HAVING A GRIZZLY BEAR
WORK WITH SALMON.

579
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,733

00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:18,367
AND, "GOOD MORNING,
GRIZZLY BEARS."

586
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,467
[grunts]

AND THE GRIZZLY BEARS
IS LIKE,

00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,333
LIKE, "RAAWWWRR,

591
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,500
[growls]

00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,067
"OH, MY GOD, HUMAN RESOURCES.

595
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:41,433

00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,700
LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN GO,
"HEY, GOOD MORNING.

597
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:46,333
"GOOD MORNING, FISH.

OHHH."

599
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,433
I CAN'T TOUCH YOU.

600
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:50,733
LIKE, "OHHH, LOOK AT THAT.

601
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,633

"USUALLY I KILL FISH
AND EAT 'EM AND STUFF,

00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,333
"BUT I JUST WANTED
TO JUST RUB THAT--

GOD DAMN."

612
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:15,767
THAT'S OPPRESSIVE.

613
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,900
LIKE, YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN--

614
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,200
AND THERE'S CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE.

615
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,533
YOU CAN'T DO,
LIKE, WEIRD STUFF

616
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:28,100
BEHIND HER BACK, LIKE--

617
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,500
WHY WOULD IT BE DISRESPECTFUL
IF I SAID--

618
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:30,533
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

619
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,233
[inaudible]

620
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,333
TYRELLE.

621
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,267
IF I GO, "HEY, TYRELLE,
WE WORK TOGETHER."

622
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,333
AND I GO, "TYRELLE,
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.

623
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,433
"LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU GETTIN' UP

624
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:38,533
"TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

625
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:42,733
SO I CAN SNIFF YOUR CHAIR."

626
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,767
THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL
BECAUSE IT'S SEXUAL.

627
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,067
BUT THAT KEEPS ME
FROM BEING--

628
00:24:58,067 --> 00:24:59,067
LIKE, I THINK--LOOK.

629
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,133
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE
A HOLIDAY.

630
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,433
FOR LACK
OF A BETTER WORD,

631
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,433
HARASSMENT DAY.

632
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,433
BUT NOT--
THAT SOUNDS WHATEVER.

633
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:13,333
BUT I MEAN A DAY
WHERE I GET TO FIND OUT--

634
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,067
LIKE--BECAUSE--
AND THIS IS WHY

635
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,067
IT SHOULD BE
HARASSMENT DAY,

636
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,433
BECAUSE WOMEN GET TO BE
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUALLY

637
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:20,433
ALL THE TIME.

638
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:21,433
YOU GET TO BE INAPPROPRIATE.

639
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,367
AND WHEN I SAY INAPPROPRIATE,

640
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,067
I MEAN SAY HELLO TO ME
TOO CLOSE.

641
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,067
"HI!"

642
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,300
MMM-MEH.

643
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,100
OR SOME WEIRD MASSAGE

644
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,733
'CAUSE YOU THINK
WE'RE FRIENDS,

645
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:38,867
AND YOU,
"GOOD MORNING,"

646
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,067
A LITTLE KISS,
AND HE'S JUST LIKE,

647
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:42,067
"OHHH.

648
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,800
"OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

649
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,833
BOY, BOY, BOY."

650
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,067
AND YOU THINK
IN YOUR HEAD, MAN,

651
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,133
"I WONDER IF I--

652
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:53,700
I WONDER IF I, YOU KNOW--"

653
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,633
BUT HARASSMENT DAY
ALLOWS YOU

654
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:59,267
TO BE ABLE TO ASK.

655
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,167
ALL YEAR, I SAY THE TUESDAY
BEFORE THANKSGIVING.

656
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,467
AND IT'S--
AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

657
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,533
FLOWERS AND EVERYTHING.

658
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,667
YOU BUY HER FLOWERS,

659
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,767
YOU JUST REAL COOL.

660
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,133
YOU WALK UP,
YOU'RE RESPECTFUL.

661
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,900
YOU SAY,
"HEY, HOW ARE YOU?"

662
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,300
YOU KNOW,
GOOD AFTERNOON TO HER,

663
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,700
HAPPY HARASSMENT DAY.

664
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:23,867
AND YOU JUST, LIKE, SAY,

665
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,733
"LISTEN, I WAS WONDERING
ALL YEAR

666
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:30,500
IF YOU WOULD SUCK MY DICK
IN THE BROOM CLOSET."

667
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,900
AND YOU JUST BE LIKE,
"NO, THANK YOU, I'M NOT--"

668
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,067
AND YOU'D BE LIKE,
"I'M--THANK YOU.

669
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,967
"KEEP THE FLOWERS.
I JUST THOUGHT--

670
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,133
"I MADE A MISTAKE.

671
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,467
"I THOUGHT YOU WAS A HO
ALL YEAR.

672
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,700
"I WAS CONFUSED.

673
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:56,567
I THOUGHT YOU WAS A HO,
BUT YOU'RE NOT."

674
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,567
EVEN ANIMALS, MAN.

675
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,167
ANIMALS SMELL IT ON US.

676
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,400
THEY DO.

677
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,500
ANIMALS SMELL
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

678
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:06,667
LIKE WITH THE DOG WHISPERER.

679
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,367
HE GOT ANIMALS.

680
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,567
AND I'M A ANIMAL--UH--

681
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,567
LET ME SAY THIS, MAN.

682
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,700
I-I'M A WHAT THEY C--

683
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,967
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE TERM IS

684
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,167
FOR, UH,
EXTREME ANIMAL LOVER.

685
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,633
LIKE, I-I GET SICK
WHEN I SEE ANIMALS SUFFERING.

686
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:20,933
AND I KNOW THAT'S CONTRARY

687
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:24,533
TO POPULAR BELIEF SOMEHOW.

688
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,800
SOMEHOW IT'S SPREAD OUT

689
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:30,900
THAT BLACK PEOPLE, WE--
LIKE, WE HATE ANIMALS.

690
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:33,100
LIKE, WE CAN'T STAND
DOGS AND CATS.

691
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:34,100
AND I-I DON'T GET IT.

692
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,700
THAT'S THE NEWS DOING THAT.

693
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,833
'CAUSE THEY ONLY SHOW DUDES
THAT HATE DOGS.

694
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:39,167
LIKE WHEN THE VICK STUFF
WAS HAPPENING.

695
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,167
[deep voice]
"WHAT DO YOU THINK

696
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,767
OF MICHAEL VICK
AND THE DOG?"

697
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,967
THEY JUST SHOW--
EVERY DUDE THEY SHOW

698
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,067
IS LIKE, "MM, DOGS?
MAN, FUCK DOGS.

00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,667
WHERE IS THIS GOING?"

873
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,300
WHY'S IT HAVE TO GO
SOMEWHERE?

874
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,367
IT'S JUST COOL
RIGHT NOW, LIKE--

875
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,167
HERE'S THE BEST RELATIONSHIP
IN THE WORLD,

876
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,967
IS WHEN THE WOMAN
LOVES YOU...

877
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:41,567
AND THE MAN LIKES HER.

878
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,067
SO IF I LIKE YOU,
AND YOU LOVE ME,

879
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:50,900
THAT'S PERFECTION.

880
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:53,167
BECAUSE I LIKE LIKE.

881
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,400
LIKE IS LIKE WHEN--

882
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:56,267
THAT'S WHEN HE'S HAPPY
TO SEE YOU

883
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,733
AND HAPPY TO HEAR YOU,

884
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:58,933
AND YOU DOING THINGS

885
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:02,067
THAT DON'T DISRESPECT
THE HAPPY.

886
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,867
YOU LIE ABOUT LIKING SPORTS,

887
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,333
AND YOU DO
ALL KINDA THINGS.

888
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:07,700
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS,
LIKE, RIDICULOUS,

889
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:12,467
BUT I'LL PUT IT
IN VAGINAL TERMS FOR YOU.

890
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,700
'CAUSE I SEE THE FACES,
LIKE, "HUH?"

891
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,067
AND THEN GUYS GO,

892
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,867
"HEY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT."

893
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,767
LIKE, BUT I-I--
BUT GUYS DO.

894
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,833
I F--I SPEAK
FLUENT DUDE, MAN.

895
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,133
I-I UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE.

896
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,300
I'MA TELL YOU WHY--

897
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,467
OKAY, LADIES, YOU--
HOW MANY TIMES

898
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,067
HAS THERE BEEN A GUY
IN YOUR LIFE, OR GUYS,

899
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,567
WHERE THERE'S BEEN MEN
IN YOUR LIFE

900
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,233
WHO WANT TO SLEEP
WITH YOU,

901
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,100
BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SLEEP WITH HIM?

902
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,433
ZILLIONS.
YOU CAN'T COUNT IT.

903
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,767
SO WHAT THAT MEANS,
THERE'S A--

904
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,933
THERE'S A PHILOSOPHY THERE,

905
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,833
MEANING YOU ARE SEXABLE.

906
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,600
HE WANTS TO SLEEP
WITH YOU.

907
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:49,067
BUT JUST 'CAUSE YOU
ARE SEXABLE

908
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:50,967
DON'T MEAN I'M SEXABLE.

909
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:51,967
RIGHT?

910
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,067
SAME THING WITH LOVE.

911
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,900
JUST 'CAUSE I'M LOVABLE...

912
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:07,667
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU'RE LOVABLE TOO.

913
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,433
YOU'RE JUST LIKABLE TO ME.

914
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:22,200
YOU DIDN'T DO FOR ME
WHAT I DID FOR YOU

915
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,500
TO FEEL THAT WAY.

916
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:24,967
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

917
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,433
IT--IT--IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

918
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,833
SO IF YOU JUST WAIT FOR ME
TO LOVE YOU,

919
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:31,600
THEN YOU--YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

920
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:34,267
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT
A WHILE.

921
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,367
BUT MEN DON'T HAVE
THE OPTION

922
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,767
TO MUSCLE YOU
LIKE YOU MUSCLE US.

923
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,200
"YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOTTA EITHER
SHIT OR GET OFF THE POT.

924
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,500
"WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
THIS MANY MONTHS,

925
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:48,367
AND IT'S TIME FOR US
TO DISCOVER WHERE--"

926
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
LIKE, BUT MEN DON'T SAY
NOTHIN' LIKE THAT

927
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:52,767
TO MUSCLE YOU, MAN.
THAT'S--THAT'S, YOU KNOW--

928
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,533
I CAN'T GO, "LOOK,
WE'VE BEEN GOING OUT

929
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,067
"FOR A WEEK NOW.

930
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,867
"IT'S--IT'S--IT'S, UH...

931
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,167
"IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO ROLL
THESE PANTIES DOWN 'CAUSE...

932
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,500
"IT'S BEEN TOO LONG
I BEEN BUYING YOU DRINKS,

933
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:12,700
AND YOU GOT TO EITHER SHIT
OR GET OFF THE POT."

934
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:20,467
BUT WHEN YOUR WOMAN
LOVES YOU,

935
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,067
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET PAST THAT, MAN.

936
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,533
A WOMAN'S LOVE
IS SO BEAUTIFUL, MAN.

937
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:26,333
MEN'S LOVE IS
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL.

938
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,767
IT AIN'T PURE,
'CAUSE IT'S WORK. IT'S JOB.

939
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,267
I LOOK AT MY GIRL
LAYING THERE,

940
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,267
I BE LIKE, "GOD! OHH, MAN!"

941
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,267
I WANT TO CALL OUT SICK
FROM LOVE.

942
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,367
I BE LIKE, "DAMN."

943
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,767
BUT SHE'S SLEEPING
RIGHT THERE.

944
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,633
I BE WANTIN' TO GIVE
THE CALL-IN-SICK VOICE.

945
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:41,700
[groans]

946
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:44,067
"I CAN'T MAKE IT
TO LOVE YOU TODAY.

947
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,933
I GOT A..."

948
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,533
[groans]

949
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,300
BUT WHEN YOUR WOMAN
LOVE YOU, MAN,

950
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,300
YOU FEEL WEIRD.

951
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,833
I TRY TO START ARGUMENTS
WITH MY GIRL

952
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:55,833
ALL THE TIME JUST
SO THAT SHE LOVE ME LESS,

953
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,067
'CAUSE SHE JUST--

954
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,867
THE WAY SHE LOVE ME,
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

955
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,067
I'M LIKE, "DAMN."

956
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,733
IT AIN'T--
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

957
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,433
BUT SHE LOVES, MAN.

958
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:11,367
AND LOVE FOR A WOMAN
EMBODIES EVERYTHING.

959
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,333
IT'S LIKE...
[panting and moaning]

960
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:14,900
SHE'S CONCERNED
ABOUT MY HEALTH.

961
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:16,233
AIN'T NO MAN IN HERE

962
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:19,300
EVER ASK HOW
THEIR WOMAN'S HEALTH IS, EVER.

963
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,633
LOOK AT THIS NIGGA LAUGHIN'.

964
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,467
HOW LONG Y'ALL BEEN TOGETHER,
BY THE WAY, BRO?

965
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,833
- TWO YEARS.
- TWO YEARS.

966
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:26,167
HAVE YOU EVER ASKED HER
A HEALTH QUESTION?

967
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,433
NEVER.
IT AIN'T HAPPENIN'.

968
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,833
HE NEVER--WE DON'T KNOW
WHEN SHE,

969
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,800
THE LAST TIME SHE CHECKED
HER TITTIES FOR--

970
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,900
FOR LUMPS.

971
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,800
ANYBODY'S MAN EVER ASK

972
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,767
IF YOU CHECKED YOUR TITTIES
FOR FUCKIN' LUMPS? NO!

973
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,733
IF YOU TAKE PILLS,
DO YOUR MAN GO,

974
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:43,900
"HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR PILLS?"

975
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:46,267
NO, WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

976
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,500
JUST KNOCK YOUR PILLS
OFF THE--

977
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,267
"WHAT'S ALL THESE PILLS,
YOU SICK BITCH?"

978
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:03,567
"SOUND LIKE MARACAS AROUND HERE.
YOU'RE SICK."

979
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,233
AND IT'S NOT 'CAUSE
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

980
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:08,367
IT'S JUST THE WAY
WE CARE

981
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,200
IS NOT THE WAY...YOU KNOW.

982
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,433
MEN DON'T CARE ABOUT HEALTH
IN GENERAL.

983
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:20,433
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT BEING SICK.

984
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:25,867
I SHOULD BE GETTING
PROSTATE CHECKS EVERY WEEK.

985
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,733
I SHOULD BE AT LEAST DOING
MY OWN PROSTATE CHECK.

986
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:30,067
YOU CAN--IF YOUR PROSTATE'S
SWELLED UP,

987
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,500
YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN FINGER
IN YOUR BOOTY, RIGHT?

988
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:35,267
TO SEE IF YOUR PROSTATE
SWELLED,

989
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,867
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T--

990
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,200
BUT LOOK, ALL OF THAT,
I'LL NEVER KNOW,

991
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,133
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA STICK--

992
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,967
I'LL LET MY PROSTATE
FALL OUT MY ASSHOLE FIRST.

993
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:46,100
I'LL BE WALKIN',
IT'LL FALL ON THE GROUND.

994
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,333
I'LL BE LIKE,
"IS THAT MY PROSTATE

995
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,067
JUST FELL OUT
MY ASSHOLE?"

996
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,400
AND I STILL WOULDN'T GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

997
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:59,233
I'LL CALL ONE OF MY FRIENDS
ON THE PHONE.

998
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:03,033
"HEY, MAN, YOUR PROSTATE
EVER FALL OUT YOUR ASSHOLE?

999
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,400
"WHAT'D YOU DO ABOUT IT?

1000
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:06,667
PUT SOME DUCT TAPE?
ALL RIGHT, PUT SOME DUCT TAPE."

1001
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,833
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
THE LOVE.

1002
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,300
I'M TELLING YOU.
I'M DIABETIC, MAN,

1003
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,433
AND--AND, YOU KNOW,

1004
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:23,733
I'M NOT GONNA FIND NO WOMAN
THAT GIVES A--CARES...

1005
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,800
JUST OFF THE STREET.

1006
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,733
'CAUSE DIABETES, LOOK--

1007
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,667
FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T SUPPORT IT, ALL RIGHT?

1008
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,533
IF I DIDN'T HAVE IT,
I COULD GIVE A--

1009
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,467
IT'S JUST,
"WHATEVER, DUDE, REALLY?

1010
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,600
CAN'T EAT COOKIES, FAGGOT?
I DON'T CARE."

1011
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,967
[laughing]

1012
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:48,100
BUT I GOT
THAT MISERABLE DISEASE.

1013
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:49,433
IT'S JUST--
IT'S ONE OF THOSE--

1014
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,567
IT'S DETERIO--
IT'S JUST A--

1015
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,133
IT'S JUST A PAIN
IN THE ASS,

1016
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,733
'CAUSE I CAN'T EAT
AND DRINK WHAT I WANT.

1017
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:58,933
LIKE, I CAN EAT AS
MANY VEGETABLES AS I WANT.

1018
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,200
"PATRICE, YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS

1019
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,333
YOU EVER NEEDED."

1020
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,833
IT WAS LIKE, "OH."

1021
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:05,300
WHY CAN'T I EAT PASTA
AND CAKE?

1022
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,100
BUT YOU CAN'T,
AND IT HARD.

1023
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,467
IT'S LIKE BEING ADDICTED.

1024
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
FOOD IS,
I'M TELLING YOU--

1025
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,300
FOOD IS AN EVERYDAY, LIKE...

1026
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,400
I'LL BE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD, MAN, FOOD AGAIN?"

1027
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:14,367
I GOTTA THINK ABOUT--

1028
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,067
EVERY DAY, I GOTTA THINK.

1029
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:18,267
I GO TO SLEEP
THINKING ABOUT FOOD.

1030
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,667
TOMORROW, LIKE,
"WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

1031
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,067
"A'IGHT, TODAY,
I HAD SALAD AND FRUIT,

1032
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,900
"AND I--I'M GONNA
CELEBRATE TOMORROW

1033
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:29,900
"BY HAVING A WHOLE...

1034
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,733
"LAMB LEG,

1035
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,700
TO CELEBRATE HOW GOOD
I ATE YESTERDAY."

1036
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,067
IT'S JUST A SUFFERING...

1037
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:41,367
AND I UNDERSTAND
BEING ADDICTED.

1038
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,767
ANY SMOKERS?
SMOKERS HERE? ANYBODY?

00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,933

IT'S A--YOU DON'T--
YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

1042
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,933
YOU DON'T WANT TO DIE.

1043
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,800
SMOKERS ARE LIKE--
[inhales]

1044
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:56,267
YOU JUST KNOW
YOU'RE DYING, LIKE...

1045
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,667
"MAN, OH, MAN, DOG."

1046
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,100
[puffs, exhales]

1047
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,333
AND YOU GONNA GET CANCER,

1048
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:10,533
LIKE, YOU KNOW
YOU GONNA GET CANCER,

1049
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:12,067
AND YOU'RE GIVING
OTHER PEOPLE CANCER.

1050
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:13,233
YOU'RE LIKE...[blows]

1051
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:14,467
YOU'RE LIKE,
"I'M NOT A BAD PERSON,

1052
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,600
"I JUST CAN'T KEEP IT--

1053
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,500
"I CAN'T KEEP IT, UH...

1054
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:20,700
DOWN IN MY SYSTEM HERE."

1055
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,867
AND THEN THE PACK
OF CIGARETTES,

1056
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,233
THEY USED
TO SAY THINGS LIKE,

1057
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:29,133
"UH, CIGARETTES POSSIBLY

1058
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,267
"MIGHT

1059
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,067
CAUSE YOU TO BE ILL
AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE."

1060
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:36,967
NOW THEY SAY
IT WILL KILL YOU,

1061
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,133
AND YOU STILL...

1062
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:45,467
AND THEN YOU GOT
THE CIGARETTE BOXES IN CANADA.

1063
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,633
YOU EVER SEE
CANADA'S CIGARETTE BOXES?

1064
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,733
THEY GOT DEAD BABIES
ON THE BOX.

1065
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,700
LIKE, IT JUST BE
A DEAD BABY.

1066
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:55,067
CAN YOU IMAGINE SMOKING
AND RATIONALIZING?

1067
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:01,333
[laughs]

1068
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:03,267
IMAGINE YOU TELL YOURSELF,
YOU SAY,

1069
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,267
"MAN, I'M GLAD I MADE IT
PAST HIS AGE.

1070
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,667
GODDAMN."

1071
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,300
"HOW OLD WAS HE
WHEN HE STARTED SMOKING?

1072
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,800
"A DAY OLD?

1073
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,467
JESUS, SLOW DOWN, NIGGA,
USE A FILTER."

1074
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:23,800
I SAW SOME WHITE
CHOCOLATE-COVERED OREOS.

1075
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,867
OREOS DIPPED
IN CHOCOLATE, MAN.

1076
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,233
I WA--
I COULD--IT WAS--

1077
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:30,067
I WAS IN TEARS, LIKE,

1078
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,500
KNOWING I SHOULDN'T EAT IT,

1079
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:34,067
BUT I WAS IN PAIN, LIKE, GOING,
"OH, MY GOD."

1080
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,200
AND I'M TALKING TO MYSELF,

1081
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:36,733
"I CAN'T EAT
THESE COOKIES, MAN."

1082
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,567
AND THEY'RE CALLIN' ME,
AND I'M PRAYING TO GOD,

1083
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,500
AND I'M--AND I'M
LACTOSE INTOLERANT,

1084
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:42,067
BUT, LIKE, IF I EAT
THESE COOKIES,

1085
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,533
I GOTTA DRINK MILK TOO.

1086
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:44,633
I'MA GO OUT
LIKE A SOLDIER.

1087
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:45,600
IT'S LIKE, WHATEVER.

1088
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:49,767
AND THEN YOU SAY ALL KIND
OF WEIRD STUFF TO YOU

1089
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,467
TO RATIONALIZE EATING THEM.

1090
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,600
I'LL BE LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

1091
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:53,867
"I DON'T NEED
BOTH MY FEET.

1092
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,500
"I'M NOT A...

1093
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,967
"I'M NOT A BALLERINA.

1094
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:03,500
ALL I NEED IS ONE
SO I CAN DRIVE MY CAR."

1095
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,233
I'MA TELL YOU
A QUICK LOVE STORY, MAN.

1096
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:17,367
THIS WILL SUM UP
HOW MUCH MY GIRL LOVE ME,

1097
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,100
AND IT'S AMAZING.

1098
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:22,367
UM, YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID,
I'M DIABETIC, MAN,

1099
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,767
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A TRUE STORY.

1100
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,133
WHEN WE HAVE SEX,

1101
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,833
WE'RE REALLY, UH...

1102
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,100
REALLY DIRTY, MAN.

1103
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,200
WE'RE REALLY DIRTY.

1104
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:33,767
WE PEE ON EACH OTHER
AND THE WHOLE...

1105
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:43,200
BUT THAT'S--GET PAST THAT,
'CAUSE THIS IS TRUE LOVE, SO...

1106
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,233
SO I'M--
WE'RE HAVING SEX, RIGHT?

1107
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,600
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
THIS HAPPENED.

1108
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,967
WE'RE HAVING SEX,
AND THEN, UH, AFTERWARDS,

1109
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,567
SHE'S LIKE, "YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS GOOD,

1110
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,100
"BUT I THINK WE GOTTA
GO TO THE HOSPITAL

1111
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:53,133
AND GET YOU CHECKED OUT."

1112
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,667
I SAID, "WHY?"

1113
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,333
SHE SAID, "'CAUSE YOU'RE PEE
TASTES LIKE BIRTHDAY CAKE."

1114
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:01,767
AND...

1115
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,500
ISN'T THAT LOVE?

1116
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:07,067
IF YOU CAN
GET PAST THE PEE PART,

1117
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,433
THAT'S LOVE, RIGHT?

1118
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,200
WHEN SHE'S LIKE, "OH,
YOUR PEE IS TOO DELICIOUS.

1119
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:11,833
I DON'T--
I DON'T LIKE THAT."

1120
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:14,433
SHE DIDN'T GO, "YOU PEED
IN MY MOUTH, YOU NASTY--"

1121
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:17,067
SHE'S JUST LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
YOUR PEE TASTES--

1122
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,467
"I DONE LIKE THE WAY

1123
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,667
IT TASTES SCRUMPTIOUS."

1124
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,167
WHAT I'MA DO?

1125
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,267
YOU SEE
THESE THREE GOOFY GIRLS' LOOK,

1126
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,133
THEY LIKE,
"IF HE PEE IN MY MOUTH,

1127
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:26,433
"BLAH BLAH BLAH.

1128
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:29,067
BLAH BLAH-BLAH
BLAH-BLAH BLUH."

1129
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,800
THAT MEANS YOU'RE
NOT GONNA LOVE ME

1130
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,900
TO THE DEGREE THAT I NEED
TO SAVE MY LIFE, ARE YOU?

1131
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:34,900
NO.

1132
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,467
I DON'T NEED YOU.

1133
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,800
I DON'T NEED YOU
IF YOU CAN'T

1134
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,333
TASTE MY PEE AND GO,
"SOMETHING'S WRONG.

1135
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,600
YOU NEED TO GO
CHECK YOURSELF."

1136
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,100
YOU JUDGE ME.

1137
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:52,667
[laughing]

1138
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,967
[laughs harder]

1139
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,833
THAT'S YOUR WOMAN, BRO?

1140
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:58,433
HOW LONG YOU GUYS
BEEN TOGETHER?

1141
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:01,233
TEN YEARS? WOW.

1142
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:02,900
HOW LONG?

1143
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,600
2 1/2, 3 YEARS?

1144
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:07,400
Y'ALL GOIN'--

1145
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,233
YOU STICK IT IN RAW?

00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:14,100
OKAY, YOU PUT IT IN--

1147
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:15,767
LOOK IT, SHE PUNCHED HIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1148
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,967
LET ME EXPLAIN,
SHE JUST HIT HIM IN HIS ARM.

1149
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,633
I'MA EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

1150
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:24,067
THE QUICKER
THAT A MAN GOES RAW,

1151
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,400
IT MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE,
YOU KNOW, "GO AHEAD, PIMP.

1152
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:28,433
YOU GOT IT IN RAW."

1153
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:30,600
THE QUICKER THE WOMAN
GOES RAW,

1154
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:32,967
IT MAKES YOU LOOK--
YEAH, LOOSE.

1155
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:34,733
IT MAKES YOU LOOK BAD.

1156
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:41,833
'CAUSE SAFE SEX IS
A WOMAN'S RESPONSIBILITY.

1157
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,233
'CAUSE MEN ARE TRYING
TO DO IT

1158
00:46:53,267 --> 00:46:56,133
THE FIRST SECOND
WE MEET.

1159
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:59,500
LOOK, MY PROTECTION IS JUST,
I DO THIS.

1160
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,800
AND I JUST GO...
[laughs]

1161
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,167
"JUST NOT AIDS, GOD."

1162
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,067
"PLEASE DON'T LET ME
GET SICK AND DIE."

1163
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,800
IT IS YOUR

1164
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,733
RESPONSIBILITY.

1165
00:47:29,067 --> 00:47:30,100
YEP.

1166
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,933
WHEN DID Y'ALL
DECIDE TO DO IT?

1167
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:35,100
HOW LONG
DID IT TAKE, BRO?

1168
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:36,133
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?

1169
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,833
- A WHILE.

1170
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:39,633
- IT TOOK A WHILE?
WHAT'S A WHILE?

1171
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:40,833
WHAT'S A WHILE TO YOU?

1172
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:44,233
HEY, DID YOU DO
THE OLD BAGLESS TRICK,

1173
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:47,533
WHERE YOU WOULD JUST SLOWLY,
LIKE, JUST TRY TO PUT IT IN

1174
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,567

1175
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,833
AND YOU JUST, HOPEFULLY,
SHE STOP YOU?

1176
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:53,833
THAT OLD TRICK?
LIKE, "OKAY...

1180
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,733
AND THEN IT START
GETTING REAL CLOSE.

1181
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,167
YOU BE LIKE,
"NO, SHE GONNA LET ME--

1184
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:09,167
[screams]

"WE BOTH GONNA DIE

"OH, WE GONNA DIE!

[screams]

1190
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:22,800
BUT WE WON'T STOP, THOUGH.

1191
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,833
"AW, COME ON!
STOP ME!"

1192
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:30,600
[laughing]

1193
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:31,933
AND I CAN'T USE
NO CONDOM NO MORE.

1194
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:35,767
IT'S OVER--
CONDOM DAYS.

1195
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,500
I PUT A TRASH BAG
ON MY SHIT,

1196
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:38,767
IT JUST--

1197
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,967

00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:43,700
* WAH-WAH
IT'S JUST DEAD.

1199
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:46,167
I HAVE TO SEE IF MY BALLS
CAN FIT IN THERE TOO.

1200
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,667

HOW'S THAT FEEL?

1204
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,700
FILLED UP?
YOU FEEL FILLED UP?"

1205
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,933
I'MA DO--I'MA SHOW
YOU SOMETHING, LADIES, RIGHT?

1206
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:10,300
I'MA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

1207
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,800
HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFE SEX.

1208
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,633
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY GUYS
IN HERE, HONESTLY,

1209
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:16,700
HAVE USED
A DENTAL DAM BEFORE?

1210
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:20,867
[pop pop pop]

1211
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,300
[pop pop pop]

1212
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:28,300
[pop pop pop pop pop
pop pop]

1213
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,067
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A DENTAL DAM IS?

1214
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,433
YOU DO? NO ONE'S
EVER USED ON BEFORE, HUH?

1215
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:35,067
SEE?
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

1216
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,433
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING
ABOUT THE CONDOMS?

1217
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:38,533
Y'ALL JUST LIKE,
"PUT THAT CONDOM ON,"

1218
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:39,833
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE DENTAL DAM

1219
00:49:39,867 --> 00:49:44,067
IS A PIECE
OF A TRASH BAG, RIGHT?

1220
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,533
ABOUT AS BIG AS A NAPKIN
THAT YOU FLIP OUT,

1221
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,633
AND YOU LAY IT
OVER A WOMAN'S VAGINA

1222
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,833
JUST IN CASE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S--IT'S POISON.

1223
00:49:56,933 --> 00:50:00,333
TO PROTECT US
FROM IMMINENT DANGER,

1224
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:04,400
BUT WE DON'T USE IT
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE INSULTED.

1225
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:05,933
IF I'M GETTING READY
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU,

1226
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:08,400
AND I PULL OUT
A PIECE OF A TRASH BAG...

1227
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:11,133
AND YOU GO,
"UH, WHAT IS THAT?"

1228
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:13,100
"OH, I'M JUST GONNA
LAY THAT OVER YOUR VAGINA

1229
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,633
JUST IN CASE IT KILLS ME."

1230
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,067
"I'M SORRY,
WHAT DID YOU SAY?"

1231
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,667
AND WE SEE THAT FACE?
"NOTHIN', FORGET IT.

1232
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,433
"DON'T EVEN--PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.

1233
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,567
"I'D RATHER DIE THAN TO

1234
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,567
"INSULT MY WAY
OUT OF SOME PUSSY.

1235
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,767
I'D RATHER JUST GET
WHAT YOU GOT."

1236
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,967
[laughing]

1237
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,333
NO OFFENSE,

1238
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,000
BUT THAT'S US.

1239
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:44,267
WE ARE NOT LIKE YOU.

1240
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,933
UNDERSTAND THAT.

1241
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:47,933
WE'RE GOOD CREATURES,
SPECIAL--

1242
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:49,933
WE ARE, BUT
WE'RE JUST NOT LIKE YOU.

1243
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:52,033
WE'RE NOT LIKE--
WE DON'T TELL THE TRUTH,

1244
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:55,667
AND THE REASON IS
BECAUSE WE CANNOT.

1245
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,200
TRUTH IS, UH...
HERE'S WHAT TRUTH IS.

1246
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:02,800
TRUTH IS A FEELING
THAT GOES FROM YOUR GUT

1247
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,967
TO YOUR MOUTH
INSTANTANEOUSLY.

1248
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:07,700
WOMEN GET TO BE TRUTHFUL.

1249
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:09,067
YOU GET TO SAY...

1250
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,100
AND YOU SAY
ANY KIND OF FOUL,

1251
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:12,567
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
AN EDITING--

1252
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
IT JUST COMES UP.

1253
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:15,533
"I JUST--
TWO PLUS TWO IS SEVEN."

1254
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,933
[squawks]
JUST SAY IT.

1255
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:18,067
[squawks]
"I DON'T CARE."

1256
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,167
AND YOU BE LIKE,
"IT'S--IT'S FOUR."

1257
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,767
[squawks] "IT AIN'T.
IT'S WHATEVER I WANT IT TO BE!"

1258
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,300
[screech]

1259
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,633
[squawks] "I'MA TALK
IF I FEEL LIKE IT."

1260
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:25,867
[squawks]

1261
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,833
AND...

1262
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:32,767
MEN DON'T DO THAT.

1263
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,367
WE CAN'T BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

1264
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,800
MAN TRUTH IS CRUEL.

1265
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,567
IF WE TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME,

1266
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,967
THAT'S CRUELTY.

1267
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:44,367
MEN--MEN GO FROM OUR GUT,

1268
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,700
AND THEN IT STOPS
AT THE HEART,

1269
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:48,133
WHERE WE EDIT IT.

1270
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,133
WE EDIT WHAT THIS WAS.

1271
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,467
WHAT THIS WAS
WAS GONNA BE FOUL,

1272
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,100
SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY
WHAT THIS WAS.

1273
00:51:57,133 --> 00:52:02,867
AND THEN, IT GOES
INTO THE BRAIN FOR FURTHER...

1274
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,967
TOUCH-UPS.

1275
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:05,567
YOU KNOW, ANALYSIS.

1276
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,667
MMM, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

1277
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,967
AND THEN YOU SAY IT.

1278
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:10,933
WE DON'T JUST SPEW
STUFF OUT, MAN,

1279
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:13,533
BECAUSE HOW WE REALLY FEEL
ABOUT YOU,

1280
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:17,267
IT JUST--IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT COOL

1281
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,533
LIKE THIS,
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT YOU.

1282
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,333
YOU SAID TEN YEARS?

1283
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:24,833
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
HONESTLY.

1284
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:28,800
WHAT'S YOUR DAYDREAM
ON HOW TO KILL HER?

1285
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,567
- YOU WANT TO GET ME KILLED?

1286
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,833
- HERE'S WHERE
YOU'RE MESSING UP.

1287
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:41,433
I'MA TELL YOU
WHERE YOU'RE MESSING UP.

1288
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:43,200
HE GOES--HE SAYS TO ME,

1289
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,133
"HEY, MAN, YOU TRYING
TO GET ME KILLED?"

1290
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,767
SO YOU SEE HOW
WE CAN'T TELL THE TRUTH?

1291
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,800
THE--THE LIE, RIGHT?

1292
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:54,467
THAT MEANS
THAT HE THINKS ABOUT IT.

1293
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,533
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

1294
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:59,100
YOU SHOULD SAY, "I DON'T THINK
ABOUT KILLING MY WOMAN,"

1295
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,233
BUT YOU GO, "YOU TRYIN'
TO GET ME KILLED?

1296
00:53:01,267 --> 00:53:04,333
"IF I TELL YOU
HOW I'D KILL THIS BITCH,

1297
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:08,067
SHE GONNA KILL ME!"

1298
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,533
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET IT OUT NOW.

1299
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:12,733
HOW DO YOU KILL HER, MAN?

1300
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,233
JUST SO SHE KNOW.

1301
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:19,067
HOW DO YOU DAYDREAM
ABOUT IT?

1302
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:20,233
SPIT IT OUT.
SHE'S LOOKING AT--

1303
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:21,500
IT'S OVER. JUST--

1304
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,333
SWEETIE, I'M TRYING
TO LET YOU UNDERSTAND

1305
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,567
WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

1306
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,833
I'M JUST SAYING
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALIVE

1307
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:28,933
MEANS HE DIDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

1308
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:31,200
HE JUST--AND
I'MA TELL YOU WHY--

1309
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:34,500
WHY GUYS THINK ABOUT KILLING
THEIR WOMEN.

1310
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:37,933
IT'S 'CAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

1311
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:43,133
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
OUT OF MY LIFE,

1312
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:47,500
BUT I DON'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

1313
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:53,133
SO I'D RATHER YOU
BE DEAD,

1314
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,533
THAN TO BREAK YOUR HEART.

1315
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:01,067
SO WE THINK ABOUT,
HOW DO WE KILL THIS--

1316
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:03,067
AND GET AWAY--
HOW DO YOU DO IT, BRO?

1317
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:04,300
I'LL TELL YOU
HOW I KILL MY GIRL.

1318
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,833
I PUT A PILLOW
OVER HER HEAD

1319
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,200
AND SHOOT HER TWICE
WITH A SILENCER.

1320
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,700
[imitates silenced gunshots]

1321
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:12,300
AND THE FEATHERS
COME UP,

1322
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,433
AND I LOOK
UNDER THE PILLOW,

1323
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:15,733
AND HER EYES STILL BE OPEN,

1324
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:19,133
AND I CLOSE HER EYE--
I CLOSE HER EYES AND SHIT.

1325
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,167
[kiss]

1326
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,467
AND I KISS HER SOFTLY
ON HER FACE,

1327
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,667
BUT SHE'S DEAD.

1328
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,067
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SPIT IT OUT,

1329
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,433
'CAUSE IT'LL HELP YOU NOW,

1330
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:30,700
'CAUSE YOU CAN BLAME IT ON ALL--
THE WHOLE SITUATION,

1331
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:32,100
INSTEAD OF LATER
WHEN SHE'S LIKE,

1332
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:34,400
"SO, YOU KNOW..."

1333
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,067
YOU'RE PUERTO RICAN, RIGHT?

1334
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,167
- CUBAN.
- CUBAN?

1335
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,633
OH, LORD HAVE MERC--

1336
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,600
LIKE, WHATEVER, SHE'S--

1337
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:43,133
WHATEVER ACCENT AND WHATEVER
ANGER SHE DOES IN SPANISH,

1338
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:44,133
SHE'S GONNA BE ON YOU,

1339
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:45,500
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SAY IT,

1340
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,667
THINK ABOUT IT.

1341
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,867
'CAUSE SHE GONNA
BE ON YOU.

1342
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,833
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DO YOU, YOU KNOW.

1343
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,833
AND LOOK IT, I DON'T CONDONE
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN,

1344
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:57,433
BUT I DO CONDONE
THINKING ABOUT IT,

1345
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:00,700
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IT'S LIKE,

1346
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:02,533
"HOW DO I GET YOU
OUT OF MY FACE?"

1347
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:04,833
IT'S JUST LIKE,
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1348
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,400
WHEN A GIRL'S
IN YOUR FACE, AHH!

1349
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,567
ESPECIALLY BLACK WOMEN,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1350
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,067
THIS IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT
TO WHITE WOMEN,

1351
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:15,200
'CAUSE WHITE WOMEN,
YOU DO STUFF TO GET KILLED.

1352
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:18,633
PEOPLE KILL YOU.

1353
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,933
YOUR HUSBANDS KILL YOU.

1354
00:55:24,967 --> 00:55:26,933
BLACK WOMEN DO STUFF
TO GET HIT.

1355
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:28,900
LIKE, THEY MAKE YOU
WANT TO HIT 'EM,

1356
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:30,200
'CAUSE THEY BE
IN YOUR FACE,

1357
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:31,600
LIKE THEY COULD
WHUP YOUR ASS.

1358
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:32,900
"BLAH BLAH BLAH,
BLAH-BLAH."

1359
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:34,800
YOU BE LIKE,
"I'MA PUT THIS BITCH

1360
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,867
THROUGH A FISH TANK."

1361
00:55:38,733 --> 00:55:40,367
DON'T GET IN MY FACE,

1362
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,767
'CAUSE I CAN'T
EVEN HIT YOU.

1363
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,067
I CAN'T EVEN
POKE YOU HARD.

1364
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,667
LIKE, DON'T--

1365
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,367
DON'T PRESS ME LIKE THAT.

1366
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,300
"WHAT YOU GONNA DO?
I WISH YOU WAS--"

1367
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:52,700
LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, MAN,
GET OUT OF MY FACE."

1368
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:54,433
AND I'VE NEVER HIT
A WOMAN, MAN.

1369
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:55,700
I'VE NEVER NEEDED TO.

1370
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,533
AND I BEEN--BEEN, LIKE,
"WOW, MAN.

1371
00:55:57,567 --> 00:55:59,900
THIS WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER
IF I COULD,"

1372
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:01,467
BUT I JUST...
YOU JUST...

1373
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,900
LIKE, I NEVER EVEN
MUSHED A WOMAN.

1374
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:04,900
ANYONE EVER GET MUSHED?

1375
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:06,500
YOU EVER GET MUSHED?

1376
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:09,467
YOU KNOW
WHAT A MUSHING IS?

1377
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,600
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT MUSHING IS.

1378
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,367
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT MUSHING IS?

1379
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,267
YOU DO--YEAH, SEE. LOOK
AT THE BLACK GIRL RIGHT THERE.

1380
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,233
GO AHEAD, SHOW HER.
SHOW HER.

1381
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:21,900
SHE PUT HER WHOLE HAND
OVER HER FACE.

1382
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,600
IT'S A--IT'S--
IT'S A NON-VIOLENT...

1383
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:32,833
MOVEMENT...

1384
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:37,100
WHEN YOU'RE IN MY FACE,
AAH!

1385
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,067
AND IT'S JUST TO--
IT JUST MOVES YOU...

1386
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,700
AND SOMETIMES
A TWIST.

1387
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:48,667
IT'S JUST,
"GET OUT OF MY FACE,

1388
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,867
PLEASE."

1389
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,200
I DON'T EVER
WANT TO MUSH,

1390
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:53,367
AND I'VE NEVER DONE IT

1391
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,467
I'VE COME CLOSE,
BUT I'M TOO SCARED.

1392
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,333
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL
OVER NONSENSE, MAN.

1393
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:59,133
JAIL'S--
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

1394
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:00,667
PUSH--I DON'T WANT
TO MUSH A GIRL.

1395
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,833
"GET OUT OF HERE."

1396
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:04,200
SHE STUMBLE BACK,
CRACK HER HEAD, AND...

1397
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:06,400
YOU KNOW, SHE'S LAYING
ON THE GROUND DOING THE, UH...

1398
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:08,567
THE HULK HOGAN
FROM THE '80s, LIKE...

1399
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:12,700
I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

1400
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,400
I'M LIFTING HER HAND UP
LIKE THE REFEREE.

1401
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:16,233
LIKE, "OH, COME ON, BITCH.

1402
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,067
PLEASE GET UP."

1403
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,367
AND SHE'S JUST...

1404
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,767
AND ON THE THIRD ONE,
I'M HOPING SHE GO LIKE THIS,

1405
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,367
LIKE, "OH!"

1406
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,333
[laughs]

1407
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,500
"I'M STILL LIVIN', BROTHER!"

1408
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:29,667
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OKAY!
OKAY!

1409
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,667
"OH-HO!

1410
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,900
"OH-HO!

1411
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:33,600
OH, SHE'S LIVIN'!"

1412
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:39,667
[laughing]

1413
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,800
WHITE WOMEN, THOUGH,

1414
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,067
I'MA TELL YOU
WHY YOU GET KILLED,

1415
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,667
AND THIS IS A F--
I'M FROM BOSTON, MAN.

1416
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,700
I GOT A PhD
IN WHITE PEOPLE, MAN.

1417
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,433
I GREW UP AROUND THEM.

1418
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,567
WHITE WOMEN,
YOU DON'T SCREAM AT YOUR MEN.

1419
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,267
I NEVER SEEN A WHITE WOMAN
REALLY GO "AAH!" AT YOUR MAN.

1420
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,367
"WHAT? WHAT?"

1421
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,567
BUT YOU DO SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

1422
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,067
YOU DON'T SCREAM,
BUT YOU--YOU, UH...

1423
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,267
YOU SAY, LIKE,
REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS

1424
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,967
IN HIS EAR
SO ONLY HE CAN HEAR IT,

1425
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,467
AND IT STARTS TO, LIKE,

1426
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,800
ABRADE AND WHITTLE
HIS SPIRIT DOWN.

1427
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:17,067
LIKE REALLY FOUL STUFF,
BUT NICE, LIKE,

1428
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:19,700
"YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOUR MOTHER'S BREATH STINKS."

1429
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:21,167
YOU BE LIKE...

1430
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:26,633
"WHEN'D YOU GET CLOSE
ENOUGH TO MY MO--"

1431
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:27,800
"I DON'T HAVE TO.

1432
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,467
"IT STINKS FROM HERE.

1433
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,867
AND I'M GONNA FUCK
YOUR FRIEND PHILLIP."

1434
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:39,867
"I'M GONNA FUCK BYRON
AS SOON AS YOU GO TO WORK."

1435
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:47,800
AND THEN,
THIS IS OVER YEARS,

1436
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,767
AND YOU JUST--
YOU JUST--

1437
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:54,067
UNTIL ALL YOU GOT LEFT
IS MURDER.

1438
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:55,600
YOU JUST KILL HER,

1439
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:57,700
'CAUSE YOU GOT
NO MORE SPIRIT LEFT.

1440
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:58,867
THE SPIRIT IS GONE.

1441
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,500
SERIOUS, MAN.

1442
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:05,067
IF YOU WANT
TO UNDERSTAND MEN, LADIES,

1443
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:06,933
LOOK, I'M HERE FOR YOU.

1444
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:08,633
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT WE ARE.

1445
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,367
WHAT WE ARE,
YOU KNOW, NOT WHO WE ARE.

1446
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,533
WHAT WE ARE.

1447
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:14,067
JUST LIKE WHAT WE ARE
THAT MAKES US STRUGGLE.

1448
00:59:14,067 --> 00:59:15,633
AND, REALLY,
MEN ARE PERFECT CREATURES,

1449
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:19,767
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW,
ONE...

1450
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,433
LIKE, IF MOST WOMEN
WOULD WANT TO BE A MAN

1451
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:26,133
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO GIVE UP

1452
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:29,067
THAT POWER
THAT YOU HAVE,

1453
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,433
WHICH IS OUR WEAKNESS.

1454
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,600
THAT'S OUR WEAKNESS.

1455
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:33,800
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

1456
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:35,267
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.

1457
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,067
LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO WANT
TO BE WITH OTHER WOMEN EVER.

1458
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:41,267
LIKE, I WANT TO JUST
WALK DOWN THE STREET AND GO,

1459
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,233
"I NEVER NEED TO LOOK
AT ANOTHER WOMAN AGAIN,

1460
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:46,333
'CAUSE I'M WITH THE LAST WOMAN
I'M EVER GONNA BE WITH."

1461
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:48,367
AND I'M LIKE...
BUT IT AIN'T REAL.

1462
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,933
IT'S JUST...

1463
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:55,067
LIKE, NO GUY WANTS TO CHEAT
AND HURT HIS WOMAN, MAN.

1464
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,067
THAT HURTS.

1465
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,100
FIRST OF ALL, THINK ABOUT

1466
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:59,333
WHAT CHEATING IS
FOR A SECOND, LADIES.

1467
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:00,567
CHEATING IS A MAN,

1468
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,233
HE SNEAKS OUT
OF HIS OWN HOUSE

1469
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:08,233
TO GO, LIKE, FIND SOME HAPPINESS
BEHIND YOUR BACK

1470
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:11,267
SO YOUR FEELINGS
AREN'T HURT.

1471
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,767
CHEATING IS FOR YOU.

1472
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,100
IT'S NOT...

1473
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:29,367
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

1474
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,767
WE DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

1475
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,933
IF YOU GAVE
A LIE DETECTOR TEST

1476
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:37,000
TO A MAN AND A WOMAN

1477
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,267
AND ASKED THEM
THE SAME QUESTIONS, MAN,

1478
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,667
WE WOULD PASS THEM BOTH

1479
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,400
UP TO A POINT WHERE
IT'S LIKE, HEY,

1480
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,700
ASK A WOMAN, "YOU LOVE YOUR MAN?
YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY?

1481
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:46,533
YOU LOVE YOUR HOME,
YOU LOVE WHAT YOU BUILT?"

1482
01:00:46,567 --> 01:00:47,867
"YEP."

1483
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,433
"ALL RIGHT, YOU SEE BRAD PITT
OR DENZEL WASHINGTON

1484
01:00:51,467 --> 01:00:52,667
"OR WHATEVER
STANDING THERE,

1485
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,367
"WOULD YOU RISK EVERYTHING
YOU BUILT WITH YOUR MAN

1486
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,800
JUST TO SLEEP WITH HIM?"

1487
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:57,733
AND WOMEN, LOOK, THEY'LL GO
"NAH, I WOULDN'T."

1488
01:00:57,767 --> 01:00:59,567
AND THEY'LL PASS THE TEST.

1489
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,100
THEY'LL BE LIKE,
"EH, YOU KNOW,

1490
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:02,833
"THEY LOOK GOOD,
BUT I WOULDN'T."

1491
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,633
ASK GUYS THE SAME THING,
YOU KNOW, BOOM,

1492
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,400
LOVE YOUR WOMAN,
THE KIDS, THE HOU--

1493
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:08,967
"YEAH."
"ALL RIGHT, YOU--

1494
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:11,400
YOU SEE THAT GIRL PASSED OUT
BEHIND THE DUMPSTER?"

1495
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,733
"WOULD YOU RISK EVERYTHING
FOR A PASSED-OUT WOMAN

1496
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:26,567
BEHIND A DUMPSTER?"

1497
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:33,833
"I DON'T WANT TO,
BUT LOOK AT HER

1498
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:36,767
WITH GARBAGE ON--SHE LOOKS
SO CUTE WITH GARBAGE ON HER."

1499
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:42,300
YOU EVER DISCUSS
THREESOMES, GORGEOUS?

1500
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,133
YOU NEVER HAD
A THREESOME DISCUSSION

1501
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:47,367
WITH YOUR MAN
AFTER TEN YEARS?

1502
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,300
LIKE, JUST EVEN TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

1503
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,167
JUST A TALK.

1504
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,333
LIKE,
'CAUSE IT'LL MAKE HIM--

1505
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:54,067
WOULDN'T JUST
A NICE THREESOME TALK

1506
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,200
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE,

1507
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,867
"OH, MAN, JUST COOL
THAT SHE LETS ME GET

1508
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,800
A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT EVIL OUT, RIGHT?"

1509
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,100
AND BY THE WAY,
LADIES,

1510
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:05,067
A THREESOME
IS TWO GIRLS AND A GUY.

1511
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,733
THE GIRLS BE THINKING,
"WHAT ABOUT?"

1512
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:13,633
TWO GUYS AND A GIRL
IS A TRAIN.

1513
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,600
THAT IS...

1514
01:02:15,633 --> 01:02:17,933
ME AND HIM.

1515
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,567
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

1516
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,133
AND HE BETTER NOT
LOOK ME IN THE FACE.

1517
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,333
LIKE, WHAT--

1518
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,833
"NIGGA, JUST GET
YOUR DICK SUCKED.

1519
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:33,500
WHY ARE YOU
STARING AT ME?"

1520
01:02:35,067 --> 01:02:37,767
"LET ME FUCK MY HALF
OF THE TORSO."

1521
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,867
"CATCH THIS NIGGA
BLINKIN' AT ME

1522
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,567
"WHILE I'M TRYING TO
FUCK MY HALF OF THE BODY.

1523
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,067
"DAMN! DAMN, MAN!

1524
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:50,167
NIGGA DON'T HAVE
TRAIN ETIQUETTE."

1525
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,800
[laughing]

1526
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,800
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT, RIGHT?

1527
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,433
WOMEN DON'T RELATE
TO THAT CRAP,

1528
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:03,833
'CAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH, UH...

1529
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:06,667
TO GET SEX
FOR A GUY, MAN, IT'S HARD.

1530
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,967
IT'S HARDER TO FIND--

1531
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:10,467
IT'S HARDER TO GET SEX
THAN IT IS TO FIND LOVE.

1532
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,800
I SWEAR TO GOD.

1533
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:14,833
WOMEN HOLD--YOU GOTTA

1534
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:16,833
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
TO GET THROUGH THAT,

1535
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:19,967
BECAUSE WOMEN ARE LIKE
THE BEEFEATERS FROM, UH, ENGLAND

1536
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,067
WITH THE BIG HATS,
AND THEM DUDES BE...

1537
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,333
"WHO GOES THERE?"

1538
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,600

01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:33,833
"TICKLE, TICKLE, BABY.
TICKLE, TICKLE."

1541
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:36,500
AND SHE'S JUST, "YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GET THROUGH!"

1542
01:03:36,533 --> 01:03:38,667
"OH, COME ON."
[babbling]

1543
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,400
AND--AND THAT'S SKILL.

1544
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:43,067
WOMEN, YOU DON'T HAVE IT,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T NEED IT.

1545
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,067
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SWAGGER
TO GET SOME TONIGHT.

1546
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,267
YOU DON'T.

1547
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,067
YOU CAN JUST POINT
AT IT.

1548
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:51,333
YOU CAN LOOK AT A GUY,
RIGHT, CATCH HIS EYE,

1549
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:52,767
AND GO LIKE THIS,
AND HE'LL GO, "ME?"

1550
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,133
AND THEN YOU JUST POINT
RIGHT HERE.

1551
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:56,300
AND DON'T BE SEXY.

1552
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,567
DON'T BE LIKE, "OOH."

1553
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,267
JUST--
[grunts obnoxiously]

1554
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,067
AND HE'LL LOOK AROUND
FOR A MINUTE TO MAKE SURE

1555
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:09,400
IT AIN'T A TRICK, LIKE...

1556
01:04:10,533 --> 01:04:14,467
[grunting and yelling]

1557
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,967
MONSTERS IS GIVING OUT
PUSSY, MAN.

1558
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:18,467
WHAT I'MA DO?

1559
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,433

1560
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,600

01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,133

LIKE, JUST TO SYMPATHIZE.

1563
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,967
IT'S LIKE WE'RE
LIKE SPORT FISHERMEN.

1564
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:41,067
THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYIN'.

1565
01:04:41,067 --> 01:04:42,567
THAT'S WHAT MEN ARE.

1566
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,800
WE--I MEAN,
BEING WITH ONE WOMAN...

1567
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,167
I MEAN,
FOR REAL, LADIES,

1568
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,067
IF YOU JUST SAID THANK YOU
TO YOUR MAN

1569
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:49,200
FOR BEING FAITHFUL.

1570
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:50,733
YOU JUST GO
"THANK YOU, MAN.

1571
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:52,233
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING."

1572
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,500
HE'D BE LIKE, "DAMN."

1573
01:04:56,533 --> 01:04:58,433
AND IF YOU--
IF YOU TOLD HIS FRIENDS

1574
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,967
THAT YOU THANKED HIM
FOR FIGHTING HARD

1575
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,300
AND NOT CHEATING,

1576
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,900
HIS FRIENDS WOULD BE LIKE,
"WHAT?"

1577
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,800
LIKE, THEY WOULD LOOK AT YOU
LIKE YOU WAS AMAZING.

1578
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,767
IT'S SIMPLE.

1579
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,700
MEN LIKE TO FISH.

1580
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,200
AND SPORT FISHING
IS DIFFERENT

1581
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:14,467
FROM CATCHING
FISH FOR FOOD.

1582
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,567
YOU JUST GET IT--

1583
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,200
YOU GET IT,
YOU CATCH IT,

1584
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:18,600
AND YOU, YOU KNOW...

1585
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:19,933
YOU SHOW YOUR FRIENDS.

1586
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:30,233
'CAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN CATCH FISH.

1587
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:31,833
YOU TAKE
A COUPLE OF PICTURES

1588
01:05:31,867 --> 01:05:33,433
SO YOU CAN SHOW PEOPLE
THE FISH

1589
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:36,600
THAT YOU HAVE
THE ABILITY TO CATCH,

1590
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:42,167
AND THEN YOU RELEASE IT
BACK INTO THE WATER.

1591
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,367
BUT A LOT OF WOMEN IN HERE,

1592
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,600
YOU HAVE BOYFRIENDS
OR HUSBANDS,

1593
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:48,800
YOU WERE FISH THAT JUMPED
BACK ON THE BOAT...

1594
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:55,367
AND JUST WAS, LIKE,
FLAPPING, LOOKING AT ME, LIKE...

1595
01:05:58,233 --> 01:05:59,867
"HI.

1596
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,433
"I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE

1597
01:06:01,467 --> 01:06:04,633

NEXT WEEK, LIKE..."

1598
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,800
"YEAH, FOR OTHER FISH.

1599
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,867
GET OFF MY BOAT."

1600
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,100
"IS THAT HOW YOU TREAT
ALL THE FISH?"

1601
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:18,467
YOU BE LIKE, "OH, GODDAMN.

1602
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,933
"NO, I'M SORRY, SWEETIE,

1603
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:22,667
YOU'RE THE LAST FISH
I EVER WANTED TO BE WITH."

1604
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,467
NOW YOU'RE STUCK.

1605
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,533
STUCK WITH THE LAST FISH,

1606
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,067
WHO WAS LOVING YOU
AND FIGHTING HARD

1607
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:30,300
TO BE ON YOUR BOAT,

1608
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,200
THEN SHE GOT COMFORTABLE,

1609
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:33,333
AND NOW,
INSTEAD OF DOING THIS,

1610
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:35,567
SHE'S LIKE, "SO...

1611
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,667
"WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR, LIKE, A YEAR NOW.

1612
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,833
WHY DO YOU STILL
HAVE A BOAT?"

1613
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:42,100
YOU BE LIKE...

1614
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,700
"SO WHAT YOU TRYING TO SAY,
I CAN'T CATCH FISH NO MORE?"

1615
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,467
"WHY DO YOU NEED
TO CATCH A FISH?"

1616
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:55,133
"BECAUSE IF I LOSE MY ABILITY
TO CATCH FISH,

1617
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:57,567
"THEN YOU NOT GONNA
FIND ME SEXY NO MORE,

1618
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,100
"SO YOU GOTTA SMELL FISH
ON ME

1619
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:02,967
"SO THAT YOU KNOW
I CAN CATCH FISH

1620
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:05,667
SO YOU CAN ACT RIGHT."

1621
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,633
THAT'S LIKE, GUYS,
YOU MEET YOUR GIRL,

1622
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,267

LIKE, HAD HO--
LIKE SHE, BIG OL' BOOTY

1624
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:25,200
AND THIS AND THAT.

1625
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:26,367
YOU GOTTA LET HER DO THAT.

1626
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,100
DON'T START TRYING
TO FRUMP HER UP

1627
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:29,967
AND GET HER FAT
AND GET HER FOUL.

1628
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,633
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHY YOU LIKE HER.

1629
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:32,900
I DON'T WANT NO WOMAN

1630
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:34,967
THAT NO OTHER GUY'S
TRYING TO FUCK.

1631
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:36,567
I DON'T WANT A WOMAN

1632
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,367
THAT I CAN SEND TO THE STORE
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,

1633
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,600
'CAUSE NOBODY'S GONNA
TRY TO RAPE HER.

1634
01:07:42,633 --> 01:07:44,133
LIKE, I GO,

1635
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:46,333
"GO GET SOME BREAD
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

1636
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:48,867
"HEY, CUT THROUGH
THE ALLEY, BITCH, 'CAUSE..."

1637
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,167
"GIRL, I TALKED
TO THE JUNKIES.

1638
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,500
THEY DON'T WANT IT.
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU."

1639
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:58,867
[laughing]

1640
01:08:06,067 --> 01:08:10,433
AND I'M JUST--
TO BE FAIR TO WOMEN, UM,

1641
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:11,967
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

1642
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:17,067
LOOK, GOD HAS BEEN
VERY CRUEL TO YOU.

1643
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:18,367
BEING A WOMAN
AS A CREATURE,

1644
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,933
I THINK
IT'S JUST UNFAIR.

1645
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:21,133
I WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE A WOMAN.

1646
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,367
IT'S JUST...
I MEAN, LIKE, YOUR PERIOD,

1647
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,133
LIKE,
I LOOK AT THAT AND--

1648
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,567
AND SEE WHAT MY WOMAN
GO THROUGH

1649
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,600
EVERY MONTH.

1650
01:08:29,633 --> 01:08:33,067
LIKE, IF MY NOSE BLED
EVERY MONTH,

1651
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,800
I THINK I WOULD
KILL MYSELF.

1652
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:39,333
I WOULD BE LIKE,
"MOTHER--OH, MY GOD, MAN."

1653
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,300
YOU GOTTA STICK SOMETHING
IN YOUR NOSE

1654
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,067
WITH A STRING HANGING OUT.

1655
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:49,200
GOTTA TAKE THAT OUT,
WHAT, EVERY SEVEN SECONDS

1656
01:08:49,233 --> 01:08:50,367
OR WHATEVER.

1657
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,133
AND FIVE DAYS
BEFORE YOUR NOSE BLEEDS,

1658
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:54,300
YOU KNOW
IT'S GONNA BLEED,

1659
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,500
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN,

1660
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:57,767
SO YOU JUST
SITTIN' THERE LIKE,

1661
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,933
"WHEN IS MY NOSE

1662
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:05,700
"GOING TO START BLEEDING?

1663
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:09,400
OH, MY GOD!"

1664
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:11,167
AND THEN IF YOUR NOSE DON'T
BLEED WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO,

1665
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,700
YOU'RE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD!

1666
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:17,500
"MY NOSE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE BLEEDING BY NOW!"

1667
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,533
[crying]

1668
01:09:19,567 --> 01:09:25,067
"I'MA GO TO THE HOSPITAL
IF IT'S NOT BLEEDING SOON!"

1669
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:30,800
AND Y'ALL GET HORNY
AND...

1670
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,667
MY WOMAN GETS HORNY ON HER--
OH, MY GOD.

1671
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,067
AND I AIN'T DOWN WITH THAT.

1672
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,933
AND I SEE HER FACE,
LIKE IF I WOULD DO IT ONE TIME,

1673
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,900
IT PROBABLY
WOULD CHANGE HER LIFE,

1674
01:09:41,933 --> 01:09:44,267
LIKE SHE WOULD BE
JUST SO GRATEFUL,

1675
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,667
BUT I JUST CAN'T.

1676
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,333
SHE'S LIKE, "COME ON.

1677
01:09:48,367 --> 01:09:50,333
"YOU KNOW, COME ON.
JUST...

1678
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:53,833
JUST LAY A--COME ON,
LAY A TOWEL OR SOMETHING DOWN."

1679
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,067
AND I WAS GONNA DO IT
ONE TIME,

1680
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:01,067
BUT THEN I GOOGLED
THE WHOLE CYCLE.

1681
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,800
THERE'S ALL KIND OF STUFF
HAP--I DON'T...

1682
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,667
I SHARPENED A MOP STICK.

1683
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,933
EVERY MONTH,
I JUST POKE HER,

1684
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,133
I GO, "YAH! GET BACK!

1685
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,167
"YAH! BACK!
GET IN THE CLOSET!

1686
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,800
GET OUT OF HERE!"

1687
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,633
SLIDE HER SOME RAW MEAT
UNDER THE DOOR.

1688
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:25,933
"EAT THAT FOR A WEEK!
HA! GET BACK!"

1689
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:31,867
IT'S SHOCKING.

1690
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,733
LIKE, I KNOW,
LOOK, LIKE I SAID, I'M 40.

1691
01:10:34,767 --> 01:10:35,867
I CAN FEEL...

1692
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,567
I CAN FEEL MY SEX DRIVE,
RIGHT?

1693
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,767
I STILL LOVE WOMEN,
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE--

1694
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,900
I DON'T FEEL LIKE HAVING SEX
LIKE THAT.

1695
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:44,067
BUT I STILL LOVE
LOOKING AT 'EM, LIKE, "OH."

1696
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,467
BUT HERE'S WHAT GOD
DID FOR MEN.

1697
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,800
HE TURNED MY HORNINESS
INTO CREEPINESS.

1698
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:50,200
LIKE, SO...

1699
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,100
I CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME
SITTING AT THE MALL

1700
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:57,733
WATCHING CHICKS TRYIN'
ON SNEAKERS AT THE FOOT LOCKER,

1701
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:59,433
WITH THE CREEPY FACE, LIKE...

1702
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:09,333
MMM!

1703
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,233
I'M GOOD FOR THE DAY.

1704
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,167
BUT WOMEN,
YOU DON'T GET CREEPY.

1705
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,967
YOU GET HORNIER
AS YOU GET OLDER.

1706
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:24,067
IT'S WEIRD,
YOU WANT TO DO ALL YOUR SEXIN'

1707
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:27,367
BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 30 AND 50.

1708
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,100
THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT IT.

1709
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:31,700
BUT HERE'S HOW SAD
THINGS ARE.

1710
01:11:31,733 --> 01:11:35,867
THE VALUE OF VAGINA'S ONLY GOOD
FROM 18 TO 29.

1711
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,400
PUSSY GET OLD LIKE BREAD,
NOT LIKE WINE. IT--

1712
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:51,100
I DON'T WANT THE WAITER TO BRING
ME A VINTAGE GLASS OF TWAT.

1713
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:53,800
HE'D BE LIKE,
"WOULD YOU LIKE A

1714
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:58,500
"'52 LE STINKY VAGINA

1715
01:11:58,533 --> 01:12:01,467
FROM THE FUNK-FUNK REGION?"

1716
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,700
YOU'D BE LIKE, "UGH!

1717
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:04,333
"YOU AIN'T GOT A BETTER YEAR
THAN THAT?

1718
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:05,400
"YOU AIN'T GOT A..."

1719
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:07,467
[laughs]

1720
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,167
"GOT A '89 DOWN THERE?
GIVE ME A '89.

1721
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,767
"I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS.

1722
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,500
WATER, JUST '89."

1723
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:17,967
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU NOT SEXY IF YOU--

1724
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,367
IF YOU 40 OR WHATEVER.

1725
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,933
I'M NOT--
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, WHATEVER.

1726
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:26,600
I'M JUST SAYING
20 IS JUST...

1727
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,700
20.

1728
01:12:29,733 --> 01:12:31,467
20.

1729
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,067
WHO'S 20 DOWN HERE?
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

1730
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:36,800
OLDER THAN 20?
I HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE.

1731
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,567
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU
CHEW CIGARETTES.

1732
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,067
SHE'S JUST LIKE...

1733
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:42,767
AS CUTE AS YOU ARE,
YOU CAN HEAR IT.

1734
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,500
[gravelly]
"I'M OLDER THAN 20."

1735
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,100
'CAUSE WOMEN
WHO ARE NOT 20--

1736
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:47,467
DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED?

1737
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,833
SHE RAISED HER HAND FAST.
[high-pitched] "20! YAY!"

1738
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,200
[gravelly] "AHEM, UM..."

1739
01:12:55,667 --> 01:13:00,067
"OLDER THAN 20."

1740
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:01,667
20 YEARS--GOD.

1741
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,067
I BET YOU YOUR PUSSY
TASTES LIKE HOPE.

1742
01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:11,467
[laughing]

1743
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,833
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS.

1744
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,933
BUT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

1745
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:24,533
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
40-YEAR-OLD COOCH AND 20,

1746
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,900
IT'S THE AMOUNT OF TIME
I WAIT. THAT'S IT.

1747
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:28,800
20, I WAIT FOREVER.

1748
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:32,067
JUST WAIT IN THE CORNER,
LIKE, "OH, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

1749
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:36,933
I AM GOING TO WAIT
FOR THIS 20-YEAR-OLDNESS."

1750
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:39,967
40, I--
A DATE.

1751
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:41,100
TWO DATES.

1752
01:13:41,133 --> 01:13:42,300
TWO DATES,
AND THEN YOU GOTTA START

1753
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,600
ROLLIN' THEM OLD DRAWERS DOWN.

1754
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:51,233
FROM WHERE IT IS,
PULLED UP TO THE BRA.

1755
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:03,733
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE NOT SEXY
IF YOU'RE 40--

1756
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:07,200
I'M NOT. I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S THE TIME, THAT'S IT.

1757
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:08,600
LIKE, I WANT IT NOW.

1758
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:10,567
IF I'M WILLING TO EAT
SOME STALE CRACKER JACKS,

1759
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,533
I'LL EAT
SOME STALE CRACKER JACKS,

1760
01:14:13,567 --> 01:14:16,600
BUT I WANT 'EM RIGHT NOW.

1761
01:14:16,633 --> 01:14:20,100
IF I SAY, "HAND ME THEM STALE
CRACKER JACKS RIGHT THERE,"

1762
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:21,433
AND YOU GO,
"COME AND GET 'EM,"

1763
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:23,767
I'LL BE LIKE,

1764
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,067
"JUST THROW 'EM
ON THE FLOOR.

1765
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,233
"THEY OLD.
THE BOX IS OPEN

1766
01:14:30,267 --> 01:14:31,833
"THERE'S NO PRIZE
IN IT.

1767
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,700
WHERE THE MAGNIFYING GLASS?"

1768
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:40,800
"ONE PEANUT?
GET THAT--GET OUT OF HERE!"

1769
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:46,533
MAKING ME CRAWL AROUND
FOR OLD CRACKER JACKS.

1770
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:49,900
AND YOU WILL LAUGH AT THAT,
LADIES, IF

1771
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:52,967
IT'S JUST NOT FUN
FOR YOU.

1772
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:53,967
NOTHING'S FUN.

1773
01:14:54,067 --> 01:14:55,067
SEX ISN'T FUN.

1774
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,200
SEX IS SO MUCH FUN
FOR DUDES.

1775
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,967
'CAUSE WE GOT
A MONEY SHOT.

1776
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:06,300
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE--

1777
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:07,833
THE--THE--FEELING.

1778
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:10,500
LIKE, WE BOTH
HAVE ORGASMS.

1779
01:15:10,533 --> 01:15:11,733
UHH! UHH!

1780
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:14,333
BUT MEN HAVE A RECEIPT.

1781
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:16,133
LIKE, WE...

1782
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:18,133
WE SEE IT,

1783
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,067
AND IT'S A PAYOFF.

1784
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:22,267
YOU BE LIKE,
"I AM SATISFIED,

1785
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,733
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
LOOK AT IT."

1786
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,067
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'D BE HAPPIER, LADIES,

1787
01:15:32,067 --> 01:15:34,333
IF YOU COULD JUST
HAVE A--

1788
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:36,100
IF YOU COULD JUST SHOOT
A COUPLE OF EGGS

1789
01:15:36,133 --> 01:15:37,667
IN A GUY'S FACE?

1790
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,667
YOU JUST--FFF! FFF!--

1791
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,167
RIGHT ON TOP
OF HIS FOREHEAD?

1792
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,067
YOU WANT TO BE HAPPIER?
GET ON--FFF! UNH!

1793
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,500
AND HE'S JUST SITTING THERE.

1794
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:45,800
FFF! "UNH!"

1795
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,533
AND YOU GO,
"AW, THAT FELT GOOD!

1796
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:49,300
GO IN THE BATHROOM
AND WASH YOUR FACE."

1797
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,733
HE'S WALKING
TO THE BATHROOM...

1798
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,667
[spits]

1799
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,300
"OHH!"

1800
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,667
WIPING HIS EYES.

1801
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,900
"WHY ARE YOU SO AGGRESSIVE?"

1802
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:00,400
YOU LIKE,
"SHUT UP, FAGGOT, AND...

1803
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:04,433
HURRY UP AND MAKE ME
A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH."

1804
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:05,700
[laughing]

1805
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:07,733
CALL YOUR FRIENDS
ON THE PHONE,

1806
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,900
"I JUST EGGED
ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD."

1807
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,200
"DON'T TELL YOUR FRIENDS
OUR BUSINESS!"

1808
01:16:13,233 --> 01:16:14,767
"SHUT UP!
SHE ALREADY KNOWS

1809
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,767
I EGG ON THE TOP
OF YOUR HEAD ALREADY."

1810
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,867
HEY, I GOTTA GO, MAN.

1811
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,067
Y'ALL TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

1812
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,133
[cheers and applause]
THANK YOU.

1813
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:24,600

APPRECIATE IT.
