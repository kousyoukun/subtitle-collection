1
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:37,257
我们能在这座城市生活很幸运 他们说战争很恐怖
We're lucky to be in The City. They say the war was terrible.

2
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,360
除此以外的世界 早已被战争摧毁
That the rest of the world was destroyed.

3
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,263
我们城市的缔造者建起高墙 保护我们的安全
Our founders built the wall to keep us safe

4
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,508
他们为了维持和平 把我们
and they divided us into five groups,

5
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:48,767
分成了五类 五个派别
factions, to keep the peace.

6
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,539
那些拥有知识和逻辑分析能力的聪明人
The smart ones, the ones who value knowledge and logic

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,308
属于智慧派
are in Erudite.

8
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,512
他们无所不知
They know everything.

9
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,049
和平派的人务农
Amity farm the land.

10
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,485
他们永远温静而和谐 总是那么快乐
They're all about kindness and harmony, always happy.

11
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,392
诚实派的特质是诚实和守序
Candor value honesty and order.

12
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:16,027
他们只说真话 即使有时候你希望他们别那么诚实
They tell the truth, even when you wish they wouldn't.

13
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,931
然后是无畏派
And then there's Dauntless.

14
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:23,903
他们是我们的保护者 我们的战士 我们的警察
They're our protectors, our soldiers, our police.

15
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,704
我一直都觉得他们帅呆了
I always thought they were amazing.

16
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:32,176
勇敢 无畏 而且自由
Brave, fearless and free.

17
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,815
有人觉得无畏派的成员都是疯子
Some people think Dauntless are crazy,

18
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,017
事实上 确实有一点
which they kind of are.

19
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,720
来 比阿特丽斯
Come on, Beatrice.

20
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,755
我是无私派的人
My faction is Abnegation.

21
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,257
别人都叫我们"呆子"
The others all call us "stiffs."

22
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,560
我们过着简单的生活
We lead a simple life,

23
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,763
无私地奉献自己以帮助他人
selfless, dedicated to helping others.

24
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,965
我们甚至给那些无派别的人食物
We even feed the Factionless,

25
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,366
他们不属于任何派别
the ones who don't fit in anywhere.

26
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,438
因为我们是人民公仆
Because we're public servants,

27
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,374
人们信任我们 让我们执掌政府
we're trusted to run the government.

28
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,076
我父亲和城市的领导人马库斯一起工作
My father works alongside our leader, Marcus.

29
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,649
一切都井然有序 每个人都知道自己的归属
It all works. Everyone knows where they belong.

30
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,218
除了我
Except for me.

31
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,318
母亲说 有一种艺术叫做忘我
My mother says there's an art to losing yourself.

32
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,039
但我还没学会怎么做
But I haven't figured it out yet.

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,541
我应当永远摒除私心
I'm supposed to never think of myself,

34
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,109
永远致力于帮助他人
to always help others.

35
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,246
别对着镜子看太久
To never look too long in the mirror.

36
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,586
你紧张吗?
Are you nervous?

37
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,754
不紧张
No.

38
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,459
你当时呢? 你测试前紧张吗?
Were you? For your test?

39
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,193
唔 不紧张
Mmm-mm. No.

40
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,562
只是吓坏了
I was terrified.

41
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,433
但是当时我没必要紧张的 你也是
But I didn't have any reason to be and neither do you.

42
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,543
准备好了
That's all you get.

43
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,647
规矩必须遵守
Rules are rules.

44
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,223
今天我要去参加测试
Today I take the test.

45
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:31,063
我很害怕测试结果显示我不属于无私派
I'm scared it'll tell me I'm not Abnegation.

46
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,664
那样 我就不得不离开我的家人
That I have to leave my family.

47
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,302
但我更怕测试结果是让我留在这里
But I'm even more scared that it will tell me to stay.

48
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,908
对于我哥哥伽勒 这事儿就简单多了
For my brother Caleb, it's easy.

49
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,942
让我来帮您吧
Let me help you with that.

50
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,276
他天生就乐于助人
He's a natural.

51
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,648
比阿特丽斯 能不能帮忙拿下那些袋子?
Beatrice, do you want to get the other bags?

52
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,682
抱歉
Sorry.

53
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,485
如果她双目失明或者残疾呢? 你会不会帮助她?
What if she'd been blind or an amputee? Would you have helped her then?

54
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,755
- 我想过帮助她的  - 没有那么难的
- I was thinking about helping her.  - It's not that hard.

55
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,057
对你可能不难
For you, maybe.

56
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,678
放松 比阿特丽斯 深呼吸然后相信测试
Just relax, Beatrice. Take a deep breath and trust the test.

57
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,664
相信测试
Trust the test.

58
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,698
测试会告诉我我是谁 属于哪里
Test will tell me who I am, where I belong.

59
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,969
我聪明吗?
Am I smart?

60
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,907
仁慈吗? 我是否诚实?
Kind? Am I honest?

61
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,514
无私? 还是勇敢?
Selfless? Or brave?

62
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,551
嘿 那些没给我们的食物
Hey. So, all the food that we're not getting,

63
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,787
你们都拿去给那些无派别人士了?
you guys are giving away to the Factionless?

64
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,722
- 是吗?  - 是
- Right? Yeah?  - Yeah.

65
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,658
你这个骗子 为什么你要说谎?
You're a liar. Why are you lying to me?

66
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,160
大家都知道你们把它们扣下来私藏了
Everybody knows you keep it for yourselves.

67
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,431
你为什么不承认? 嗯?
So why don't you just admit it? Huh?

68
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,212
我跟你说话呢 你们这些呆子是都聋了还是怎么着? 嘿!
I'm talking to you. Are all you stiffs deaf or something? Hey!

69
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,702
比阿特丽斯...
Beatrice...

70
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,837
别去
Don't.

71
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,073
一百年前 战争结束后
One hundred years ago, after the war,

72
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,309
我们的祖先创造了一个他们认为
our founders created a system they believed

73
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,812
足以阻止未来的战争并创造恒久和平的系统
would prevent future conflict and create lasting peace.

74
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,749
今天 以人格测试为目的的能力测试
Today, aptitude testing based on your personality

75
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,919
将把你们分进其中一个派别
will assign you to one of the factions.

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,954
尽管我们认为 你们根据测试结果
While it is our belief that choosing the faction

77
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,759
来选择相应的派别可以保障你们在这个派别取得成就
indicated by your test is the best way to ensure success within the faction system,

78
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,862
但在明天的仪式上 无论测试结果如何
it is your right tomorrow at the choosing ceremony

79
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:47,099
要选择五派中的哪个派别的权利掌握在你们自己手里
to choose any of the five factions, regardless of your test results.

80
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,404
然而 你们的决定一旦做出便不可更改
However, once the choice has been made, there will be no change permitted.

81
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,591
你们无私派是怎么看待镜子的?
What is it with you Abnegation and mirrors?

82
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,729
我们拒绝虚伪的东西
We reject vanity.

83
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,562
是啊 我知道 坐下
Yeah. I know. Sit down.

84
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,647
我是托丽 负责给你做测试
I'm Tori. I'll be administering your test.

85
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,716
你会面临一系列的选择
You'll be offered a series of choices

86
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,918
来测试你对于每个派别的资质
to test your aptitude for each faction

87
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,319
直到得出一个结论
until you get one result.

88
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,155
不要紧张
I wouldn't sweat it.

89
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,257
大约95%的人都继承了父母的派别
95% get the faction of their origin,

90
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,658
而从你的面相上看...
and from the looks of you...

91
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,898
看出什么?
What is it?

92
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,732
喝干净
Bottoms up.

93
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,747
选一个
Choose.

94
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,484
现在就选 趁一切还来得及
Now. Before it's too late.

95
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,222
- 为什么? 选一个然后干嘛?  - 选一个
- Why? What will I do with them?  - Choose.

96
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,924
告诉我
Just tell me.

97
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,164
狗狗!
Puppy!

98
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,122
起来
Get up.

99
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,057
我们得在管理员来之前出去
We're going out the back door before a supervisor comes.

100
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,959
- 但是我的结果是什么?  - 快点!
- But what was my result?  - Come on!

101
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,963
发生了什么?
What happened?

102
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,165
你告诉你家里人 血清让你难受恶心
You're going to tell your family that the serum made you sick

103
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,867
- 所以我让你回家了 听明白了没?  - 没有 但是我的结果到底是什么?
- and that I sent you home. All right?  - No, but what was my result?

104
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,002
无私
Abnegation.

105
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,139
智慧和无畏
And Erudite. And Dauntless.

106
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,210
无畏...
Dauntless...

107
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,312
你的结果是不确定性的
Your results were inconclusive.

108
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,247
不可能 这太荒谬了
That's impossible. It doesn't make any sense.

109
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:59,583
不 不是不可能 只是极其罕见而已
No. Not impossible. It's just extremely rare.

110
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,387
他们把这类人叫做"分歧者"
They call it "Divergent."

111
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,892
你不能告诉任何人你的测试结果 甚至是你父母
You can't tell anyone about this. Not even your parents.

112
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,261
所有人都会认为
As far as the world is concerned,

113
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:12,598
你的测试结果是无私 因为我手动设定了这个结论
you received an Abnegation result because that is what I manually entered.

114
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,434
那我在选择仪式上应该怎么做?
So what am I supposed to do at the choosing ceremony?

115
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,970
我本来应该得知该怎么做的
I was supposed to learn what to do.

116
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,572
今天的测试应该告诉我我属于哪个派别
This was supposed to tell me what faction to choose, the test.

117
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:24,241
- 我们应该信任测试  - 测试对你无效
- We're supposed to trust the test.  - The test didn't work on you.

118
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,279
你得相信自己
You have to trust yourself.

119
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,596
你今儿怎么样?
What happened to you today?

120
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,932
测试结束后 你去哪儿啦?
Where did you go after your test?

121
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,568
我觉得有点恶心 所以他们就先让我回来了
I got sick, so they sent me home early.

122
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,370
你完成测试了吗?
Did you finish your test?

123
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,136
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

124
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,374
你的结果是什么?
What was your result?

125
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,179
你的呢?
What was yours?

126
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,184
你为什么不打一声招呼就走了?
Why did you just leave without telling anybody?

127
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,151
我不舒服
I was sick.

128
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,956
比阿特丽斯...
Beatrice...

129
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,992
我觉得你根本不了解我们现在面临多危急的状况
I don't think you understand the level of scrutiny we're under.

130
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,374
他们正想尽办法地败坏我们的名声
They're doing everything they can to discredit us right now.

131
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,664
谁?
Who is?

132
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,933
智慧派
Erudite.

133
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,669
他们觉得我们不配执掌政府 他们才是政府的主人
They believe that they should be the governing faction, not us.

134
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,604
所以你们现在要小心点 知道吗?
So you have to be careful right now, okay?

135
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,639
即使马库斯也遭到攻击
Even Marcus is under attack.

136
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,339
为什么?
For what?

137
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,810
那是一桩旧案了
It's an old accusation.

138
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,014
他虐待他的儿子
That he mistreated his son

139
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,516
然后他儿子叛逃了
and that's why the boy defected.

140
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,252
- 事实真如此吗?  - 不
- Is that true?  - No.

141
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,054
当然不是
Course not.

142
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,755
孩子天生叛逆
Children defect for all kinds of reasons.

143
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:29,033
别在这儿耽搁太久了 你们需要好好睡一觉...
Don't take too long in here. You need a good night's sleep...

144
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,669
为了明天的典礼
For tomorrow.

145
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,807
我 唔...
I, um...

146
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,347
我们爱你们
We love you.

147
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,161
晚安
Good night.

148
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,532
我为你骄傲 亲爱的
I'm so proud of you, honey.

149
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,457
- 比阿特丽斯?  - 怎么?
- Beatrice?  - What?

150
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,314
明天选择的时候...
Tomorrow when we choose...

151
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,120
你要好好为家人考虑一下
You have to think of the family.

152
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,521
嗯
Yeah.

153
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,356
但你也要为自己考虑
But you also have to think of yourself.

154
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,403
各派成员们 请在指定区域就座
Factions, please gather in your assigned areas.

155
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,447
早安 珍宁
Morning, Jeanine.

156
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,850
早 安德鲁 马库斯最近怎么样?
Good morning, Andrew. How is Marcus holding up?

157
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,252
一切正常
As well as can be expected.

158
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,721
我们要找到散播谣言的人
We need to find out who's behind these rumors.

159
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,192
我觉得 我们都知道是谁在捣鬼
I think we all know who it is.

160
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:37,429
如果是智慧派的人 我发誓我一定会把他找出来
If it's someone from Erudite, I promise I'll find out who.

161
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,332
这是你的孩子们啊 我都不知道他们也要今天选择呢
These are your children. I don't think I knew they were choosing today.

162
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,367
- 你叫什么?  - 我是... 我是伽勒
- What's your name?  - I'm... I'm Caleb.

163
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,703
- 很高兴认识您  - 我叫珍宁·马修斯
- It's a pleasure to meet you.  - Jeanine Matthews.

164
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,672
你叫?
And you are?

165
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,806
这是比阿特丽斯
This is Beatrice.

166
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,811
你们俩今天都要做出重要的决定
Well, you both have a big decision to make today.

167
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,647
我相信 无论你们选择什么 你们的父母都会支持的
I'm sure your parents will support whatever choice you make.

168
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,415
这不应该是选择的
That's not supposed to be a choice.

169
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,026
测试应该告诉我们我们要做什么
The test should tell us what to do.

170
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,290
- 你仍有权利自己选择  - 但你们不希望我们那么做
- You're still free to choose.  - But you don't really want that.

171
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,224
比阿特丽斯...
Beatrice...

172
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:14,199
我希望你正视自己的内心 选择你真正归属的派别
I want you to choose who you truly are and where you truly belong.

173
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,536
不能因为一时兴起 也不能因为你希望成为某个人而做出选择
Not on a whim. Not because you wish you were someone you're not.

174
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,839
而应当因为你非常了解自己
But because you honestly know yourself.

175
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,109
我希望你做出明智的选择 而且我知道你会的
I want you to choose wisely. And I know you will.

176
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,586
派别的系统是就像一个生命体
The faction system is a living being

177
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,690
你们都是其中的细胞
composed of cells, all of you.

178
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,326
这个生命体能够存活且繁荣的唯一方式
And the only way it can survive and thrive

179
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,597
就是每一个人都找到自己最准确的位置
is for each of you to claim your rightful place.

180
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:50,634
未来属于那些知道他们归宿的人
The future belongs to those who know where they belong.

181
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,276
在离开这个房间之后
When we leave this room,

182
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,778
你们将不再是家庭的从属者
you will no longer be dependents

183
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,179
而是社会中的正式成员
but full-fledged members of our society.

184
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,949
派别比亲情重要
Faction before blood.

185
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,485
派别比亲情重要
Faction before blood.

186
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,057
我爱你...
I love you...

187
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,526
不论你的选择是什么
No matter what.

- I'm Christina.  - Beatrice.

207
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,672
他们是真要弄死我们 还是只有我有这种感觉?
Is it just me or are they trying to kill us?

208
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,420
准备!
Get ready!

209
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,507

- 他们在跳  - 啥?
- They're jumping.  - What?

211
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,283
如果不跳呢?
What if you don't jump?

212
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,384
你觉得呢? 你会变成无家可归的人
What do you think? You'll be factionless.

213
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,386
好运啦 阿尔
Good luck, Al.

214
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,555

219
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,826
如果你们想加入无畏派 这是入门考核
If you want to enter Dauntless, this is the way in.

220
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,761
可你要是连跳下去的勇气都没有
And if you don't have the guts to jump,

221
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,830
那你便不属于无畏派
then you don't belong in Dauntless.

222
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,799
下面有水还是怎么?
Is there water at the bottom or something?

223
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,699
跳下去不就知道了
I guess you'll find out.

224
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,604
或者不跳也行
Or not.

225
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,973
咱们刚跳了一次 还要跳一次?
We just jumped. They want us to jump again?

226
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,634
总得有出头鸟吧 谁第一个?
Someone's gotta go first. Who's it gonna be?

Me.

228
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,445
脱吧 呆子!
Yeah, stiff, take it off!

229
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,547
再穿上!
Put it back on!

230

今天 新生训练
Today, Initiate.

231
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,842
怎么 有人把你推下来的?
What, you get pushed?

232
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,542
不是
No.

233

It's...

235
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,186
有那么难记吗?
Is that a hard one?

236
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,388
要是想换个名字 就换吧 但得想好
You can pick a new one if you want, but make it good.

237
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,622
过了这村就没这店了
You don't get to pick again.

238
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,794
好... 我叫特丽丝
Okay... My name's Tris.

239

我一般在控制室工作
Most of the time I work in Intelligence,

245
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,761
但训练期间 我是你们的导师
but during your training, I'll be your instructor.

246

Four like the number?

248
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,802
没错
Exactly like the number.

249
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,670
怎么说 一到三都被别人占了?
What happened, one through three were taken?

250
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,377
你叫什么?
What's your name?

我教你的第一堂课就是
The first lesson you learn from me

254
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,557
在这要是想活命
if you wanna survive here,

255
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,791

- Seriously?  - Is there no other area?

270
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,551
开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

271
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,052
别拘谨 就像在家一样 诚实派
You should feel right at home, Candor.

272

Everything out in the open.

273
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,556
这是开玩笑吧?
Is this a joke?

274
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,356
换衣服
Get changed.

275
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,660
好 有人要冲澡吗?

我们能坐那儿吗?
Shall we sit there?

279
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,300
你以前从没见过汉堡吗?
Have you never seen a hamburger before?

280
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,370
见是见过 但从没吃过
No, I've seen one. I just have never eaten one.

281
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,272
无私派只吃粗茶淡饭
Abnegation eat plain food.

282
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,542
主要吃素 不放酱料 尽量少烹调
Plant-based diet with no sauces and a minimum of seasoning.

283
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,278
你这啃的是哪本课本?
Which textbook did you swallow?

284
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,813
也很高兴认识你 我叫威尔 来自智慧派
Nice to meet you, too. I'm Will. Erudite.

285
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,250
看出来了
Of course you are.

286
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,619
无意冒犯 但我还以为无私派连饭都不吃呢
No offense, but I'm surprised Abnegation even eats at all.

287
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,489
太自私了 不是吗? 怪不得你离开了
Too selfish, right? No wonder you left.

288
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,524
要想和诚实派做朋友 得很自信才行
You gotta be pretty self-confident to be friends with a Candor.

289
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:34,726
这是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

290
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,062
你们口无遮拦 想到什么说什么
You have no filter. You say the first thing that comes into your head.

291
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,465
比方说 "你是个白痴"?
You mean like, "You're an idiot"?

292
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,700
说得好 阿尔 至少我们说了实话
Nice one, Al. At least we tell the truth.

293
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,136
智慧派说实话是因为我们掌握了事实
Erudite can tell the truth because we have the facts.

294
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,917
别再提你们的老派别了
I don't want to hear about your old factions.

295
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,275
你们现在都是无畏派
You're Dauntless now.

296
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,411
你也是转派的? 还是生于无畏派家庭?
Were you a transfer, too? Or Dauntless-born?

297
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,314
你在开玩笑?
Are you kidding?

298
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,416
没有
No.

299
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,260
你凭什么认为有资格和我说话?
What makes you think you can talk to me?

300
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,858
这...
It...

301
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,429
一定是因为你看起来太和蔼可亲了
Must be because you're so approachable.

302
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,739
小心点
Careful.

303
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,829
阿四...
Four...

304
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,846
朋友啊 你可真是活得不耐烦了
You, my friend, have a death wish.

305
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,417
他是班上的第一名
You know, he was first in his class.

306
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,787
他们两次想招他进领导层 但他都拒绝了
They tried to recruit him for leadership twice, but he said no.

307
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,100
新生 起立
Initiates, stand.

308
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,310
你们选择加入了勇士一派
You have chosen to join the warrior faction

309
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,214
肩负保卫这座城市及其居民的责任
tasked with the defense of this city and all its inhabitants.

310
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,317
我们信仰正当的勇敢行为
We believe in ordinary acts of bravery

311
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,353
以及促使人们
and the courage that drives one person

312
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,854
拔刀相助的勇气
to stand up for another.

313
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,090
铭记于心
Respect that.

314
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,392
让我们为你自豪
Do us proud.

315
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,971
哇!
Whoa!

316
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,407
所有人两分钟内到基地深坑集合
I want everyone in The Pit. Two minutes.

317
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,552
训练分两个阶段
There are two stages of training.

318
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,921
第一个是体力
The first is physical.

319
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,623
将体能逼到极限
Push your bodies to the breaking point

320
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,224
便能掌握格斗技巧
and you'll master the methods of combat.

321
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:24,195
第二个是意志力 同样 逼到极限
The second is mental. Again, breaking point.

322
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,432
你们将直面自己最深的恐惧 在被打倒之前战胜恐惧
You'll face your worst fears and conquer them unless they get you first.

323
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,434
你们将与无畏派出身者分开训练
You'll be trained separately from the Dauntless-born,

324
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,537
但放在一起排名
but you'll be ranked together.

325
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:36,774
新生训练之后 排名会决定你们去做什么工作
After initiations, rankings will determine what jobs you move into.

326
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:41,546
领导层 守护围栏 或是防止无派别人士自相残杀
Leadership, guarding the fence, or keeping the Factionless from killing each other.

327
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,408
排名也会决定谁出局
The rankings will also determine who gets cut.

328
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,419
出局?
Cut?

329
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,423
每一训练阶段结束后 排名最末的新生将离开这里
At the end of each stage of training, the lowest-ranking Initiates will be leaving us.

330
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,692
去干什么?
To do what?

331
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:58,494
回家是不可能了 只能成为无派别人士
There's no going home to your families, so you'd live factionless.

332
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,234
- 为什么事先没有声明?  - 新规矩
- Why didn't we know that?  - It's a new rule.

333
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,235
新规矩? 理应事先告知才对
A new rule? Somebody should have told us that.

334
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,705
为什么? 那样你就不来这里了吗?
Why? Would you have chosen differently?

335
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,508
因为恐惧?
Out of fear?

336
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,945
如果真是这样 那你现在就可以出局了
I mean, if that's the case, you might as well get out now.

337
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:17,647
如果你真的属于我们 那成败与否根本无足轻重
If you're really one of us, it won't matter to you that you might fail.

338
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,549
你们选择了我们
Now you chose us.

339
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,686
现在轮到我们来选择你们了
Now we get to choose you.

340
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,680
就是按统计学来看 你到现在也该打中一次靶子了
Statistically speaking, you should have hit the target at least once by now.

341
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,282
哪怕是瞎猫碰上死耗子
Even by accident.

342
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,359
嗨 有什么情况吗?
Hey. What have you got?

343
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,762
无派别人士 没什么动作
Factionless. Not doing anything.

344
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,897
瞧瞧 呆子 那就是你的新家庭
Check it out, stiff. That's gonna be your new family.

345
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,969
快去打个招呼
Go say "Hi."

346
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,412
准备好真正干上一架了吗?
You ready for some real fighting?

347
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,281
差得远呢
Not even close.

348
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,982
第一个跳下来的那个!
First jumper!

349
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,284
上格斗场
In the ring.

350
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,620
最后一个跳下来的!
Last jumper!

351
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,690
来干一架吧
Time to fight.

352
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,367
要打多久?
How long do we fight for?

353
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,303
直到一方不能接着打
Till one of you can't continue.

354
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,937
或者某一方认输
Or one of you concedes.

355
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,739
这是老规矩
According to the old rules.

356
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,507
新规矩是 不准认输
New rules, no one concedes.

357
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,612
你真想让她们第一次上场就往死里打啊?
You really want to lose 'em on their first fight?

358
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,714
真正的勇士绝不认输
A brave man never surrenders.

359
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,384
你说得轻松 咱们那个时候规则可不是这样
Lucky for you, those weren't the rules when we fought.

360
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,886
这一项要打分 所以卖力打
You'll be scored on this, so fight hard.

361
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,556
开始!
Go!

362
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,711
别害怕 呆子!
Don't be scared, stiff!

363
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,823
漂亮 特丽丝!
Nice, Tris!

364
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,684
- 漂亮  - 好!
- Nice.  - Yeah!

365
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,475
大家过来
All right, guys, over here.

366
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,244
听好了
Listen up.

367
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,450
知道这板是干什么的吗?
Know what this board is?

368
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,120
这是你们的命
It's your life.

369
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,022
我们每天为你们打分排名
We grade you every day.

370
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,858
要是第一阶段结束你们的名字还是红色 那就出局了
If you're still in the red by the end of the first stage, you're out.

371
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,662
我不可能通过的
I'm never gonna make it.

372
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,531
肯定可以
Yes, you are.

373
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,099
我是这里最弱的一个
I'm the weakest one here.

374
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,700
那你将是进步最大的那个
Then you'll be most improved.

375
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,538
你可是诚实派 不该撒谎的
You're Candor. You're not supposed to lie.

376
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,475
我以前是诚实派 再说我也没有撒谎
I was Candor. And I'm not lying.

377
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,978
他们要是把我踢出局的话 我爸妈应该会接我回去
If they cut me, I think my parents would take me back.

378
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,515
不是那样的
No, it doesn't work like that.

379
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,418
就算他们想 他们的派别也不允许
Even if they wanted to, their faction wouldn't allow it.

380
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:43,385
就算我父母接我回去
Even if my parents would take me back,

381
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,755
我也不再属于那里了
I wouldn't belong there anymore.

382
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,693
- 有点压抑啊  - 是
- This is getting depressing.  - Yeah.

383
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,829
你知道我们该干嘛吗? 去纹身
You know what we should do? Get tattoos.

384
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,823
你知道吗 可以纹自己的脸?
Did you know they had a tattoo of your face?

385
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,774
- 喜欢吗?  - 嗯
- Like it?  - Yeah.

386
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,476
- 想纹在哪?  - 不知道
- Where would you get it?  - I don't know.

387
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,678
有什么建议吗?
Where do you suggest?

388
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,980
哪里都行
Anywhere you want.

389
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:13,549
这里吧 是这样的
Here, it's this thing here.

390
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,401
你还记得我吧?
You remember me, right?

391
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,238
- 我只是在想你能不能...  - 不
- I was just wondering if you could...  - No.

392
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,874
我只负责纹身
I just do tattoos.

393
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,380
好吧
Okay.

394
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,759
我要纹这个
I'd like this one.

395
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,928
谢谢了
Please.

396
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,771
我能不能问问你...
Can I just ask you...

397
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,808
你不该选无畏派的
You made a mistake choosing Dauntless.

398
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,549
- 他们会发现你的...  - 谁?
- They'll find out about you...  - Who?

399
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,246
谁会发现?
Who will?

400
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,647
那些你对其构成威胁的人
The people you're a threat to.

401
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,084
- 什么人? 谁 无畏派?  - 不 整个社会
- What people? Who, Dauntless?  - No, society.

402
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,466
你如果不属于任何一类 他们就无法控制你
If you don't fit into a category, they can't control you.

403
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,223
我不明白
I don't get it.

404
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:30,259
我是无畏派 我要进无畏派 我选择了无畏派
I'm Dauntless. I'm going to be Dauntless. I chose Dauntless.

405
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,531
为了你 希望如此
For your sake, I hope so.

406
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,935
你身体太弱 没有肌肉
You're weak. You have no muscle.

407
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,846
- 你这样是没法赢的  - 多谢提醒
- You're never gonna win, not like that.  - That's good to know.

408
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,714
你得利用你的全身
Yeah, you're gonna have to use your whole body.

409
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,814
这里绷紧
Keep tension here.

410
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,787
- 好的...  - 然后开攻
- Okay...  - And go on offense.

411
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:07,356
你有速度 因此可以先发制人
You're fast, so you could win if you attack first.

412
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,538
一旦突破防守 便直捣喉咙
You get inside, you jab to the throat.

413
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:12,963
阿四!
Four!

414
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,464
接着练
Keep working.

415
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:25,009
对不起了 威尔
Sorry about that, Will.

416
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,451
加油啊 克丽丝
Come on, Chris.

417
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,728
住手... 住手!
Stop... Stop!

418
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,765
够了 我不行了
I'm done. I'm done.

419
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,465
你要住手?
You need to stop?

420
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,135
好
Okay.

421
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,071
我来帮你
Let me give you a hand.

422
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,815
谢谢
Thanks.

423
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,196
好了 大家都休息一下!
All right, let's everyone take a break!

424
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,361
感觉好点了没?
You feelin' a little better?

425
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:19,129
好多了
Yeah, I'm fine.

426
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,964
哇!
Whoa!

427
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,103
抓住铁栏
Grab the rail.

428
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,484
松手亦可
Or don't.

429
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,809
给你三个选择
You've got three options.

430
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,044
在那儿吊着 我就不计你的懦弱
Hang there and I'll forget your cowardice.

431
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,179
掉下去摔死
Fall and die.

432
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:38,447
或者放弃
Or give up.

433
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,529
但如果放弃 就出局了
But if you give up, you're out.

434
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,061
加油啊 克丽丝!
Come on, Chris!

435
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,078
够了!
Time!

436
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,455
无畏派从不言败
Dauntless never give up.

437
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,967
作为无畏派 我们为界内的每一条生命战斗 不能失败
As Dauntless, we fight to protect every life inside the fence, without fail.

438
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,537
这就是这样训练你们的原因
That's why we train you the way we do.

439
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,474
教你们永不言弃
To teach you not to give up.

440
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,945
并找出谁能胜任
And to find out who has what it takes.

441
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,155
即使已沉静多年 也可能随时发生变化
Even though it's been quiet out there for years, that could change at any moment.

442
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:53,023
所以我们必须做好一切准备
So we have to be ready for everything.

443
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,790
喔!
Whoo!

444
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,475
外面那些是什么?
What's out there?

445
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,544
怪物们
Monsters.

446
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,245
和平派的农庄
Amity farms.

447
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,080
我知道 但比那更远的地方是什么?
No, I know. But beyond that?

448
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,048
战后一直荒废的地方
Places that never recovered from the war.

449
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:21,185
你知道吗?
Do you know?

450
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:24,127
只能说他们建围墙是有原因的
Let's just say they built their fence for a reason.

451
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,704
小子!
Man!

452
00:45:52,115 --> 00:45:53,217
你还挺擅长这个啊
You're kinda good at this.

453
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,150
来吧
Come on.

454
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,860
真可悲
That was pathetic.

455
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,997
它打滑了
It slipped.

456
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,697
那去捡回来啊!
Well, go get it!

457
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,338
什么 他们还在扔的时候去捡?
What, while they're throwing?

458
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,206
你怕了吗?
Are you afraid?

459
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,208
怕被飞来的刀子刺伤? 确实
Of getting stabbed by an airborne knife? Yeah.

460
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,208
所有人停下来
Everybody stop.

461
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,281
站在靶子前面
Stand in front of the target.

462
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,962
阿四 借你的手一用
Four, gimme a hand here.

463
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,764
他扔刀子的时候 你就站在那里
You're gonna stand there while he throws those knives.

464
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,636
要是我看到你怕了 你就走人
And if I see you flinch, you're out.

465
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,407
今天你要学到的一点是
One thing you will learn here

466
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,775
命令是不可违抗的
is that orders are not optional.

467
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,093
住手
Stop.

468
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,302
谁都可以站在靶子前面 那并不能证明什么
Anyone can stand in front of a target. It doesn't prove anything.

469
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:21,164
那你可以代替他站在那里
Then it should be easy for you to take his place.

470
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,782
规则不变
Same rules apply.

471
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,959
哦 不是吧 阿四
Oh, come on, Four.

472
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,309
你可以扔得更近一点
You can get closer than that.

473
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:03,191
- 你想让我切她一点头发?  - 是 就切掉头顶的一点头发吧
- You want me to give her a little trim?  - Yeah, maybe just a little off the top.

474
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,463
对于勇敢 呆子
Points for bravery, stiff.

475
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:22,898
不是谁都能像你一样 有些人从此就张不开嘴了
Not as many as you just lost for opening your mouth.

476
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,236
现在自己小心点
Now watch yourself.

477
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,873
我们训练的是士兵 不是叛军
We train soldiers, not rebels.

478
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,911
今天到此为止 出去
But we're done for today. Get out.

479
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,253
- 你还好吗?  - 你切到我了
- You all right?  - You cut me.

480
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,287
我故意的
I meant to.

481
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,758
你故意的?
You meant to?

482
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,394
你以为不让你受点伤 他会放过你吗?
You think he was gonna let you off without a scratch?

483
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:54,698
要是我没切到你 你还站在那里呢
You'd still be standing there if I hadn't hit you.

484
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:57,365
这么说我该谢谢你了?
So am I supposed to thank you?

485
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,372
你应该学聪明点
You're supposed to be smart.

486
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:05,907
要是我想伤你 我就做得出来
If I wanted to hurt you, I would have.

487
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,220
她来了
There she is.

488
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,193
你真的是不想活了
You do have a death wish.

489
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,395
我想不到你会对埃里克说那种话
I can't believe you said that to Eric.

490
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,097
你是唯一站出来反对他的人
You're the only one who's ever stood up to him.

491
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,132
看看你的耳朵 我们帮你清理一下
Look at your ear. Let's get you cleaned up.

492
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:33,303
嘿 特丽丝 干得不错
Hey, Tris. That was cool.

493
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,270
谢谢
Thanks.

494
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,611
印象深刻啊 呆子 恭喜你
Impressive, stiff. Congrats.

495
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,646
闭嘴
Shut up.

496
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:46,783
怎么? 嘿 你现在出名了 跟埃里克没有关系
What? Hey, you're famous now. I mean, not because of the thing with Eric.

497
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,252
你上新闻了 真的 听着
You're in the news. Yeah, listen.

498
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:52,689
"最近的转入者安德鲁·普莱尔的孩子
"The recent transfers of Beatrice and Caleb Prior,

499
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,760
比阿特丽斯·普莱尔和伽勒·普莱尔
children of Andrew Prior, call into question the soundness

500
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,394
对无私派的教育和价值有所质疑
of Abnegation's teachings and values.

501
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:02,365
是什么让他们选择离开?
What prompted them to leave?

502
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:06,369
答案也许就在于整个派别腐败的理想
Perhaps the answer lies in the corrupted ideal of an entire faction.

503
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,172
盗窃资源 普遍无能
The theft of resources, the general incompetence,

504
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,108
虐待孩子"
the abuse of their children."

505
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,809
他们打你了吗 像马库斯·伊顿的孩子那样?
Did they beat you, like Marcus Eaton's kid?

506
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,248
他们没有打过人 他们是好人
They didn't beat anyone. They're good people.

507
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,349
好吧 所以你要离开?
Right. And that's why you left?

508
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,458
我说错什么了吗?
Was it something I said?

509
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,860
- 他是个笨蛋  - 没错
- He's an idiot.  - Yeah.

510
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,294
嗯 没关系
Yeah. That's okay.

511
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,437
她来无畏派做什么?
What's she doing at Dauntless?

512
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,543
普莱尔
Prior.

513
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,477
你是安德鲁·普莱尔的女儿 对吗?
You're Andrew Prior's daughter, aren't you?

514
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,448
比阿特丽斯
Beatrice.

515
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,884
这里只有特丽丝
It's just Tris now.

516
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:56,184
特丽丝 这名字我喜欢
Tris, I like that.

517
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,557
嗯
Hmm.

518
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,627
特丽丝 不管你父母怎么想 也不管你的测试结果是什么
You made an impressive choice, Tris, despite your parents.

519
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:05,994
你的选择令人钦佩
And your test result.

520
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:07,831
你看过我的测试结果了?
You've seen my test result?

521
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,667
当然
Of course.

522
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:13,529
我很高兴你非常聪明 了解自己的内心
I'm glad you were smart enough to know your own mind.

523
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,473
如果有什么需要可以来找我
Let me know if you ever need anything.

524
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,884
好奇怪啊
Well, that was weird.

525
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,886
是啊
Yeah.

526
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,491
你觉得发生什么事了?
What do you think is goin' on?

527
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:37,561
我猜他们在抓分歧者
I bet they're hunting Divergents.

528
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:40,562
智慧派的人整天都在聊这个
That's all they talk about at Erudite these days.

529
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,334
等等 真的有分歧者?
Wait. Divergents are real?

530
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,715
来吧 阿尔
Come on, Al.

531
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:57,045
第一场 彼得对特丽丝
First fight. Peter versus Tris.

532
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,349
什么?
What?

533
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,049
啊哦
Uh-oh.

534
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,954
埃里克干的
It's Eric.

535
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,588
他就是想让你名次退后
He's just trying to get back at you.

536
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,761
- 嘿  - 干嘛?
- Hey.  - What?

537
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,465
还记得我说过要怎么攻击吗?
Remember what I said about attack?

538
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,500
先出手一击 正中喉咙
First shot, right to the throat.

539
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,002
然后你看着他
And you watch him.

540
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,538
他出手前会先向前一步
He steps before he punches.

541
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,606
记住了?
All right?

542
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,372
嗯
Mmm.

543
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,749
好了吗 呆子?
All right there, stiff?

544
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,452
看来你要准备哭了
Look like you're about to cry.

545
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,953
要是你哭了 可能会考虑放点水
Might take it easy on you if you cry.

546
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:39,688
加油 特丽丝
Come on, Tris.

547
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,048
起来 起来
Get up. Get up.

548
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,916
快点 别再玩来玩去
Come on. Stop playin' with each other.

549
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,364
哇 你看起来...
Wow. You look...

550
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,064
看起来很不好
Look bad.

551
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,371
我躺了多久了?
How long have I been here?

552
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:02,505
差不多一天
About a day.

553
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:04,674
一天?
A day?

554
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,809
你看了分数板吗? 我排第几?
Have you seen the scoreboard? Where am I?

555
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,259
你在红线下面
You got below the line.

556
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:15,683
你们为什么穿这种背心?
Why are you wearing those vests?

557
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,087
战争游戏
War games.

558
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,957
- 哇  - 你要做什么?
- Whoa.  - What are you doing?

559
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,492
- 我现在就去  - 不行
- I'm coming.  - You can't.

560
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:24,127
埃里克说你的课程结束了
Eric says you're done.

561
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,662
什么?
What?

562
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:27,595
他说你出局了
He said you're out.

563
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,967
你爸爸是理事会成员 特丽丝
Your father's on the council, Tris.

564
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,389
也许他们会破个例 准你回家
Maybe they'll make an exception and let you go home.

565
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,272
我们也很难过 特丽丝
We're sorry, Tris.

566
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,567
我们得走了 我们要错过火车了
We gotta go. We're gonna miss the train.

567
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,710
好 走吧
Yeah, okay.

568
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,986
- 拜  - 拜
- Bye.  - Bye.

569
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,528
- 拜  - 拜
- Bye. - Bye.

570
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,432
谢谢
Thanks.

571
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,742
嗨
Hi.

572
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,110
- 嗨  - 你在这里做什么?
- Hi.  - What are you doing here?

573
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:49,712
我只是想着我一定要做到
I just figured that I had to make it.

574
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,646
谁让你出来的?
Who let you out?

575
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,184
我自己
I did.

576
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,251
你?
You did?

577
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,459
好
Okay.

578
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,708
我们坐吧
Let's sit you down.

579
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,576
*先夺得对方的旗帜或杀光对手者胜
游戏很简单 就像"夺旗"
The game's simple. It's like Capture the Flag.       

580
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,812
武器是这个
Weapon of choice.

581
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,182
这也叫枪?
You call that a gun?

582
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,895
这是刺激神经的飞镖
Neuro-stim dart.

583
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,531
痛觉和真实的枪伤是一样的
Simulates the pain of a real gunshot wound.

584
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,566
只持续几分钟
Only lasts a couple minutes.

585
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,002
分成两队 阿四和我是队长
Two teams. Four and I are captains.

586
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,837
你先选
You pick first.

587
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,772
好 爱德华
Okay. Edward.

588
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,043
我选这个呆子
I'll take the stiff.

589
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,879
哦 选最弱的一个
Oh. Picking the weak ones

590
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,660
这样等你输的时候就能怪到别人身上了
so you've got someone to blame when you lose.

591
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,949
差不多就是这样
Something like that.

592
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,661
埃里克的分队去哪里了?
Where did Eric's team go?

593
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,282
他们肯定去到尽头了
They must have gone to the end.

594
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,102
好了 把灯关了
All right. Lights off.

595
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,884
聚在一起 快点
Gather around. Come on.

596
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,072
好 你的策略是什么?
Okay. What's your strategy?

597
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,542
我们可以把旗藏得非常严密 让他们找不到
We can hide the flag well enough so they can't find it.

598
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,210
我们派出一支小分队去侦查他们的位置 看看能不能找到他们的旗子
Let's send out a team to scout their location. See if we can find their flag.

599
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,845
我们快攻 就是...
I say we blitz them. Just...

600
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,046
没错 这样输得更快一点
Yeah, that's the best way to lose quickly.

601
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,548
让他们来找我们
Let's make them come to us.

602
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:32,815
速战速决 他们不会料到的
End this quickly, they won't expect it.

603
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,684
我们不知道他们在哪儿
We don't know where they are.

604
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:35,685
好 我们分成两组 防御组和进攻组
Okay, we split into two groups, defense and offense.

605
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,321
- 谁让你指挥了?  - 必须得有个人做决定吧
- Who put you in charge?  - Someone has to make a decision.

606
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,790
- 我们要更积极一点  - 我们要学聪明点
- We need to be more aggressive.  - We need to be smart about it.

607
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,136
你不会跳下来吧?
You're not gonna jump, are you?

608
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,704
不会 我只是想占领一个有利位置
No, I'm just trying to get a good vantage point.

609
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,041
想法不错
Good thinking.

610
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,047
你不必跟着我
You don't have to come with me.

611
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:06,115
你应该小心点 你刚被揍了
You should go easy. You took a beating.

612
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,084
我没想到你知道了
I'm surprised you noticed.

613
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,752
我看见你在对打的过程中走开了
I saw you leave during the fight.

614
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,453
没错 我不想看下去
Yeah, well, it's not something I wanted to watch.

615
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,463
嘿!
Hey!

616
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,838
你还好吗?
You good?

617
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,676
没事吧?
You okay?

618
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,710
没事 我很好
Yeah. I'm fine.

619
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,817
已经够高了
This is high enough.

620
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,953
不 我们得爬得更高一点
No, we need to go higher.

621
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,959
你还行吗?
You all right?

622
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,066
你怕高
You're afraid of heights.

623
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,901
每个人都有害怕的东西
Everyone's afraid of something.

624
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:03,603
我原本以为你什么都不怕
I didn't think you were afraid of anything.

625
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,917
不是吧 特丽丝
Come on, Tris.

626
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,888
你确定?
Really?

627
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,127
你还是人吗?
Are you even human?

628
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,811
也没有很难嘛
This isn't so bad.

629
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,850
视野不错
Good eye.

630
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,456
看!
Look!

631
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:55,837
在那里
There it is.

632
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:00,029
- 好了 你的计划是什么?  - 我们分成两组
- All right. What's your plan?  - We split into two groups.

633
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,570
我们从这边上去 剩下的人去找埃里克交战
We'll go up this side and let the rest of you engage Eric.

634
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,695
- 我看见他们了  - 上! 上!
- I can see 'em.  - Go! Go!

635
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,980

Light 'em up!

636
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,852
还有两个! 我去接近他们!
There's two more! I'm gonna move in closer!

637
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,220
跟我来 上!
Follow me. Go!

638
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,164
- 小心右边!  - 上 上
- Watch on your right!  - Go, go, go.

639
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,928
上
Go.

640
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:32,962
克里斯汀娜 我们上!
Christina, let's go!

641
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,996
抓住他们 抓住他们!
Get 'em, get 'em!

642
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,871
这边走!
This way!

643
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,005
- 掩护我!  - 好
- Cover me!  - All right.

644
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,082
要是痛的话告诉我哦
Tell me if this hurts.

645
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,051
还是你告诉我吧
You tell me.

646
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:57,218
你个贱人!
You bitch!

647
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,747
混蛋
Asshole.

648
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:04,092
太棒了!
That was awesome!

649
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,994
掩护好!
Get covered!

650
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,690
上 特丽丝! 我保护你
Go, Tris! I'll guard.

651
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,980
哇!
Whoo!

652
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,088
游戏结束!
Game over!

653
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,256
干得好 特丽丝!
Good job, Tris!

654
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,397
嘿 特丽丝!
Hey, Tris!

655
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:15,531
怎么了?
Yeah?

656
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,966
跟我们来
Come with us.

657
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,267
你们去哪里?
Where you going?

658
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:19,869
走近路回去
Shortcut back.

659
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:24,006
小小的仪式 无畏派的风格
A little initiation ritual, Dauntless style.

660
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,931
哇
Wow.

661
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,383
好了 来吧!
All right, let's do this!

662
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,584
- 你没事吧?  - 没事
- All right, you good?  - Good.

663
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:10,086
- 系紧点  - 走你!
- Hang tight.  - Yeah. Go, go!

664
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,507
- 飞吧  - 哇!
- Fly, baby. - Whoo!

665
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:16,924
该你了
You're up.

666
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,961
快去啊!
All right, do it!

667
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,104
加油啊 妹子
Come on, girl.

668
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,201
加油! 特丽丝!
Go for it! Do it, Tris!

669
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,138
飞起来吧!
Like flying!

670
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,343
到底部别忘了拉减速带!
Don't forget to pull the brake at the bottom!

671
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,043
好的
Okay.

672
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,915
加油
Go.

673
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:39,982
准备好了吗?
You ready?

674
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,217
背带系好了
Harness is good.

675
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,186
拉减速带! 拉减速带!
Pull the brake! Pull the brake!

676
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,768
耶!
Yeah!

677
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,313

你很勇敢
You were brave.

683
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,202
是的
Yeah.

684
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:46,232
好吧 你该去找你的朋友们了
Anyway, you should get back to your friends.

685
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,844
好吧
Okay.

686
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,392
如果你们的排名在红线以上
If you're ranked above the red line,

687
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,728
就可以进入第二阶段训练
you'll move on to the second stage of training.

688
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,430
如果没达到
If you're below it,

689
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:09,932
我们就不会在你身上浪费时间了
we'll waste no more time on you.

690
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,167
这是你们的排名
Here are your rankings.

691
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,757
太好了
Nice.

692
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:26,549
你做到了
You made it.

693
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,450
你做到了 特丽丝
You made it, Tris.

694
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,596
- 好了  - 谢了
- Got it.  - Thank you.

695
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,476
好了
Here you go.

696
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:56,378
我们通过了第一阶段训练 难道奖励就是这个吗
So we pass the first stage of training, and this is our reward.

697
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,446
扔上来!
Toss it up!

698
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,346
真有意思
Glamorous.

699
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,791
妈妈?
Mom?

700
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,429
我的女儿!
Oh, my girl!

701
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,220
- 妈妈 你怎么会在这里?  - 我知道他们早晚会...
- Mom, what are you doing here?  - I knew they'd assign you here...

702
01:07:52,246 --> 01:07:56,416
派你来这里 瞧瞧你! 多健康漂亮
sooner or later. Look at you! God, you're so strong and beautiful.

703
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:00,876
- 妈妈 你不应该来这里  - 我知道 但你有危险
- Mom, you can't be here.  - I know, but you're in danger.

704
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:01,610
什么?
What?

705
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:04,180
我问你件事
I had to ask you something.

706
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:07,448
能力测试那天你没觉得不舒服 是吧?
You weren't sick the day you took your aptitude test, were you?

707
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:10,452
- 怎么了?  - 测试结果是什么?
- Why?  - What were your test results?

708
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,174
宝贝 没关系 你可以告诉我
Honey, it's okay. You can tell me.

709
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:22,062
结果是... 是不确定
They were... they were inconclusive.

710
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,467
你是分歧者?
Divergent?

711
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:28,066
千万别告诉别人 就连朋友和指导员都不能说
You can't tell anyone. You can't tell your friends, your instructors.

712
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:29,271
谁也不要相信
You can't trust anyone.

713
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,973
我没说
I'm not.

714
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:34,310
人们一直都很惧怕分歧者
People have always been so threatened by Divergents.

715
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:35,744
现在智慧派正在到处搜寻他们
But now Erudite is looking for them everywhere.

716
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,314
- 他们主动出击找寻他们  - 为什么?
- They're actively seeking them out.  - Why?

717
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,969
- 妈妈 我是什么?  - 你跟别人不同
- Mom, what am I?  - You don't conform.

718
01:08:40,995 --> 01:08:45,354
你的思维方式与众不同 他们很害怕你
Your mind works in a million different ways. They're scared of you.

719
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:48,390
第二阶段的训练对你来说最危险
Stage two of training is where you are most at risk.

720
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,493
他们会进入你的大脑 看看你对恐惧的反应
They're gonna get inside your head and watch how you respond to fear.

721
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,497
你可以通过无畏派的测试的 我以前见过的
But you can pass. You can make it through Dauntless. I have seen it before.

722
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,000
你怎么知道的这么多关于无畏派的事?
How do you know so much about this? About Dauntless?

723
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,603
别管我了 千万别让他们知道你的真实身份
Never mind about me. Do not let them know who you are.

724
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,338
等一下! 你以前是无畏派的?
Wait! Wait! Were you Dauntless?

725
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,799
- 听着  - 嘿!
- Listen.  - Hey!

726
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,942
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

727
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,481
车装好了 我们走吧
Truck's loaded. Let's go.

728
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,670
他们对她做了什么?
What did they do to her?

729
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,540
特丽丝
Tris.

730
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,753
请坐
Take a seat.

731
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,761
我要给你注射一种
I'm going to inject you with a serum that stimulates

732
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,829
能够激发大脑恐惧的血清
the part of your brain that processes fear.

733
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,631
好的
Great.

734
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,833
它会让你产生幻觉
It induces a hallucination,

735
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,903
血清中的传感器能让我看到你脑中的图像
and then transmitters in the serum allow me to see the images in your mind.

736
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:11,672
- 你能看到我脑袋里的东西?  - 嗯
- You can see inside my mind?  - Mmm-hmm.

737
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,144
躺下
Lay back.

738
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:37,433
你马上要经历前所未有的恐惧体验 特丽丝
Now, you're gonna be facing your worst fears, Tris.

739
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:40,667
大多数人会经历十到十五钟恐惧
Most people have 10 to 15 really bad ones.

740
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,472
你要保持镇定
You have to calm yourself.

741
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:47,401
稳住心律和呼吸 应对你面临的情况
Slow your heart rate and your breathing, and deal with what's in front of you.

742
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:52,881
勇敢点
Be brave.

743
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,824
这不是真实世界
This isn't real.

744
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,042
没事的 没事的
It's all right, it's all right.

745
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,610
你还好吧?
You okay?

746
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:47,896
你觉得你在幻觉里停留了多久 特丽丝?
How long do you think you were in the hallucination, Tris?

747
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,966
- 二十分钟?  - 三分钟
- Twenty minutes?  - Three.

748
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:54,201
是一般人的五分之一
Four times faster than the average.

749
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,774
我从没见过谁第一次就做得这么好
I've never seen anyone do that well the first time.

750
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,642
你是怎么对付那些鸟的?
How did you get rid of the birds?

751
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:02,110
图像不是很清楚
The image wasn't clear.

752
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,812
呃...
Um...

753
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,213
我跳进水里了
I just went into the water.

754
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:11,253
第二次会容易很多
Well, next time it'll be a lot easier.

755
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:13,222
还要再做一次?
I have to do that again?

756
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:16,091
嗯 你有很多次练习机会 最后参加考试 但你天资过人
Yeah, you have to practice several times before the final, but you're a natural.

757
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,692
一点也不用担心
You got nothing to worry about.

758
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,632
我全身都爬满了小虫子
My whole body was covered in these little insects.

759
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:27,033
它们钻进我的耳朵 喉咙...
They were in my ears, and my throat...

760
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,837
我无法呼吸
I couldn't breathe.

761
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,740
我听说有个人 大约两年前...
Yeah, I heard about this guy, like two years ago...

762
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,480
他害怕得心脏病发作 差点死在椅子上
so panicked he had a heart attack in his chair and he almost died.

763
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:35,177
什么?
What?

764
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:36,812
我们还算幸运的 是吧?
Yeah, so we've got that to look forward to, right?

765
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,915
你看来一点事都没有
You didn't seem to have any problem at all.

766
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:43,519
我? 不 天啊 太可怕了
Me? No, no, my God, it was awful.

767
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,226
算了吧 别人的时间根本没法跟你比 你太厉害了
Oh, come on. No one even came close to your time. You were amazing.

768
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:48,657
是的 她太厉害了 会把你挤出无畏派的队伍的
Yeah, what's amazing is that she's gonna knock you right out of Dauntless.

769
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:50,292
他不会把我挤出去的
She's not gonna knock me out of Dauntless.

770
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:52,694
她从倒数第一变成了正数第一
Look, she's gone from being the worst to one of the best.

771
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:54,763
肯定有人要变成倒数第一
Somebody's gotta take her place at the bottom.

772
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,165
会是谁呢? 是你
Who's it gonna be? You.

773
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,734
你能不能别说话?
Do you ever stop talking?

774
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:01,535
我只是想知道她是怎么做到的
I just want to know how she does it.

775
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,938
你搞了什么把戏?
What's your trick?

776
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,706
什么把戏也没有
I don't have a trick.

777
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:06,041
没人能这么快结束
Nobody gets through it that fast.

778
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,702
你就告诉我们你怎么做到的吧?
Why don't you tell us how you do it?

779
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,379
至少告诉你朋友吧
At least tell your friends.

780
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,584
他说的什么意思?
What's he talkin' about?

781
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:18,518
- 有轻松过关的方法吗?  - 没有
- Is there some way to make it easier?  - No.

782
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:24,825
没有 我... 我什么也没做
No, I... I'm not doing anything.

783
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,956
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

784
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,558
这不是真实世界
This isn't real.

785
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,847
你怎么做到的?
How'd you do that?

786
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,982
什么?
What?

787
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,021
你怎么打破玻璃的?
How'd you break the glass?

788
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,123
不知道 就那么打破了
I don't know. Just did it.

789
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,792
就那么打破了?
You just did it?

790
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,573
你的测试结果是什么?
What were your test results?

791
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:22,042
能力测试
Your aptitude test.

792
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,978
无私派
Abnegation.

793
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,948
我不相信
I don't think so.

794
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,749
什么?
What?

795
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,911
我觉得你在说谎
I think you're lying to me.

796
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,788
我为什么要说谎?
Why would I lie to you?

797
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,427
我再问你一遍
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

798
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:43,563
你的测试结果是什么?
What were your test results?

799
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,968
无私派
Abnegation.

800
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,672
你可以走了
Time for you to go.

801
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,113
特丽丝?
Tris?

802
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,918
告诉你吧
Just so you know,

803
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:06,186
无畏派不是那样打破玻璃的
Dauntless don't break the glass like that.

804
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,762
我弟弟和你一样
My brother was like you.

805
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:16,398
很快通过了第二阶段测试
During the second stage, he got good really fast.

806
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:18,100
仿真测试的最后一天
Last day of the simulations,

807
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:21,768
一个无畏派的领导来看他
one of the Dauntless leaders came to watch him.

808
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:26,141
然后第二天早上 他的尸体在峡谷里被人发现了
Then the next morning, we found his body at the bottom of the chasm.

809
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,442
他们杀了他
They got rid of him.

810
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:29,945
谁干的?
Who did?

811
01:17:29,946 --> 01:17:31,246
无畏派的领导层
Dauntless leadership.

812
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,947
你不能让他们发现你
You can't let them find out about you.

813
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,784
如果他们已经知道了呢?
And what if they already know?

814
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,120
那你早没命了
Then you're already dead.

815
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,222
比阿特丽斯
Beatrice.

816
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,566
你来这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

817
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:26,500
我遇到麻烦了
I'm in trouble.

818
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,541
怎么了?
What happened?

819
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:35,002
我通过不了无畏派的测试
I'm not gonna make it at Dauntless.

820
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,411
我在那里待不下去
I don't fit in there.

821
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:37,412
你必须待下去
You have to fit in there.

822
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,179
我做不到
I can't.

823
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:46,555
我... 我和他们不一样
I'm just... I'm not like them.

824
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,789
谁和他们一样? 他们是疯子
I mean, who is? They're crazy.

825
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,328
或许我可以回到无私派
Maybe I can go back to Abnegation.

826
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,130
- 不行  - 我知道 但...
- You can't go back.  - I know, but...

827
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:58,166
他们不会让你这么做的
They're never gonna let you do that.

828
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,135
- 谁?  - 智慧派
- Who? - Erudite.

829
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:02,170
他们不会再让无私派打破规矩的
They're not gonna let Abnegation break any more rules.

830
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,041
他们真以为政府是他们说了算的吗?
They actually think that they're running the government now?

831
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:07,908
马上就是了
They might be soon.

832
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,111
真的吗?
Wait. Really?

833
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,981
智慧派应该掌权 而不是无私派
Erudite should be in charge. Certainly not Abnegation.

834
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:16,151
等一下 伽勒 你怎么会这么说?
Wait, hold on, Caleb. How can you say that?

835
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:19,254
无私派已经输了 所有人都希望那样
It's what all the other factions want, now that Abnegation failed.

836
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,123
不 你在这里被洗脑了...
No. That's just what they're telling you here...

837
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,025
- 就是那样的  - 不是
- It's true.  - It's not true.

838
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,360
不是那样的
It's not.

839
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:27,028
他们是在骗你
There are liars here.

840
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,097
那些人想要操控你
There are people who know how to manipulate you.

841
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,265
你一定要清醒
You need to understand that.

842
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,265
比阿特丽斯
Beatrice.

843
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,336
我想你该走了
I think you should go.

844
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,209
派别比亲情重要 是吧?
Faction before blood. Yeah?

845
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,849
我懂了
Got it.

846
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,259
你需要跟我走
I need you to come with me.

847
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,942
住手!
Stop!

848
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,599
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

849
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,368
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

850
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,752
请坐
Please, sit down.

851
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,160
谢谢
Thank you.

852
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,995
我很高兴你今天来了
I'm glad you came here today.

853
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,263
是吗?
You are?

854
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:37,698
你在新派别里过得好吗?
Are you happy with your new faction?

855
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,601
嗯
Yeah.

856
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,370
但你过来找你哥哥了
But you came to see your brother.

857
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,406
我... 我只是想和他聊聊
I just... I just wanted to talk to him.

858
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:47,008
你见过你的父母吗?
Have you seen your parents?

859
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,708
没有
No.

860
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,099
很难接受吧
It's hard to let go.

861
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,418
派别比亲情重要
Faction before blood.

862
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:58,219
说起来容易
It's an important ideal,

863
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,121
做起来却很难
but sometimes difficult to fulfill.

864
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:03,425
这与我们的人性有冲突
It goes against our fundamental human nature.

865
01:21:03,426 --> 01:21:05,260
但人性正是我们需要
But that's exactly the weakness

866
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,629
克服的弱点
we need to overcome.

867
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,398
你觉得人性是弱点?
You think that human nature is a weakness?

868
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,269
我觉得人性是敌人
I think human nature is the enemy.

869
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,270
人性让我们有秘密 撒谎 偷盗
It's human nature to keep secrets, lie, steal.

870
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,741
我想要消除这些
And I wanna eradicate that.

871
01:21:19,742 --> 01:21:24,277
这样社会才能永保安定和平
That's how we'll maintain a stable, peaceful society.

872
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,642
你会帮我的 是吧?
You would help me with that, wouldn't you?

873
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,387
我怎么帮你?
How would I help you?

874
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,255
你知道无私派正在破坏派别系统
You're aware that Abnegation is undermining

875
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,558
还违反法律
the faction system and breaking laws

876
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,292
窝藏分歧者吧?
harboring Divergents?

877
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:45,266
我不知道
I didn't know that.

878
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:50,003
如果真是那样 我很高兴我离开了
But if that's true, then I'm glad that I left.

879
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,275
你要向我保证
See, I need to know that I can count on you

880
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,378
你能够遵守法律
to enforce the law,

881
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:59,114
即便触犯法律的人是跟你亲近的人
even if it's been broken by someone close to you.

882
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:01,314
是你很在乎的人
Someone you care about.

883
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,451
没问题
Of course.

884
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,222
很好
Good.

885
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:11,937
那我就让我的车把你送回无畏派
Then I'll have my car take you back to Dauntless.

886
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,005
快啊! 搞定她!
Come on! Get her over!

887
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,278
快点 推下去! 推下去!
Come on, do it! Do it!

888
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,646
嘿!
Hey!

889
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,401
你还好吧?
You all right?

890
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,105
还好
Yeah.

891
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,806
来吧 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

892
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,252
给你 穿上这个
Here, put this on.

893
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,356
谢谢
Thank you.

894
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,097
你在这儿会很安全
You'll be safe here.

895
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,572
抱歉
Sorry.

896
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:06,339
没事
It's okay.

897
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,415
我无法相信阿尔...
I can't believe Al...

898
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:18,386
你的排名在上升 他在下降
You're moving up through the ranks, and he's failing.

899
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:22,021
这会让他恨自己 也会恨你
It makes him hate himself and it makes him hate you.

900
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,459
他只是害怕
He's just afraid.

901
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,427
每个人都害怕
Everyone's afraid.

902
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,864
我知道 但是恐惧对阿尔这样的人会有奇怪的效果
I know, but fear does something strange to people like Al.

903
01:24:29,865 --> 01:24:32,065
对你则不会
But not you.

904
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,436
恐惧不会让你放弃 却会唤醒你
Fear doesn't shut you down, it wakes you up.

905
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:39,072
我见过的
I've seen it.

906
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,560
你应该躺下
You should lie down.

907
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,725
- 睡一会儿  - 好
- Get some sleep.  - Yeah.

908
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:01,361
我在地板上睡
I'll take the floor.

909
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,454
感觉怎么样了?
How you feeling?

910
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,356
好多了
Better.

911
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:30,225
很好
Good.

912
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,560
昨天你去了哪里?
Where'd you go yesterday?

913
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,297
去见我哥哥
To see my brother.

914
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:43,937
你在这儿感觉有点无聊 对吗?
It's getting a little boring for you here, is it?

915
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:47,609
我哥哥说...
My brother said that...

916
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:51,477
他认为智慧派正计划推翻无私派的掌权
He thinks Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.

917
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,550
你觉得他们能做到吗?
Do you think they could do that?

918
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:58,651
我觉得能 很有可能
Yeah, I do. I think it's possible.

919
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,100
取决于他们想以什么代价达到目的
Depends how far they're willing to go.

920
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:06,326
我很担心爸爸妈妈
I'm worried about my parents.

921
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,597
是啊
Yeah.

922
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:16,369
但我觉得你还有其他应该担心的事情
But I think you got other things you need to worry about.

923
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,538
不是吗?
Don't you?

924
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,541
是的
Yeah.

925
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,314
我该走了
I should go.

926
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:42,628
嗨
Hi.

927
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:44,630
嘿
Hey.

928
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:46,301
这是你的毛衫吗?
Is that your sweater?

929
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:48,303
不是
No.

930
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:49,704
那么昨晚发生了什么?
So what happened to you last night?

931
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:51,906
特丽丝 我能跟你说句话吗?
Tris, can I talk to you for a second?

932
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:54,642
听着 我只想说我很抱歉
Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

933
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:57,345
我不知道自己是怎么想的
I don't know what's wrong with me.

934
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:59,645
求你了 能原谅我吗?
Please, can you ever forgive me?

935
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,951
如果你再敢靠近我 我会杀了你
If you ever come close to me again, I will kill you.

936
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,053
特丽丝...
Tris...

937
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:07,689
离我远点!
You need to stay away from me!

938
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,123
你这个懦夫
You are a coward.

939
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:24,706
我简直不相信他会那么做
I just can't believe he would do that.

940
01:27:24,707 --> 01:27:27,173
一点都不像他的为人
It's not like him at all.

941
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,243
那边怎么了?
What's that?

942
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,881
使劲儿
Come on.

943
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,153
天啊!
Oh, my God!

944
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,423
好像是刚刚跳下去的
Guess he just jumped.

945
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,073
特丽丝
Tris.

946
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,609
特丽丝!
Tris!

947
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,811
让我一个人静一静
Leave me alone.

948
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:05,778
我对阿尔的事感到很遗憾
I'm sorry about Al.

949
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,483
他的死是我的错
It's my fault that he's dead.

950
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:11,652
不 跟你无关 那是他自己的选择
No, it's not because of you. He made his own choice.

951
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,421
否则他就会无家可归
He would have been factionless.

952
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:15,789
他肯定不会通过最后的测试
He was not gonna pass that final test.

953
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,930
我也不会
Neither am I.

954
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,129
为什么那么说?
Why do you say that?

955
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:29,836
你知道原因的
You know why.

956
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:36,043
只要其他人发现 他们就会杀了我
And as soon as all the others find out, they're gonna kill me.

957
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,578
我不会让那一幕发生
I'm not gonna let that happen.

958
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,123
关上门
Shut the door.

959
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:53,494
你需要练习
You're gonna practice.

960
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,463
- 在我感到恐惧的情形下?  - 不是
- In my fear landscape?  - No.

961
01:28:55,464 --> 01:28:57,330
在我这里
In mine.

962
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,863
我们一起练习
We go in together.

963
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:02,494
你以前这么做过吗?
Have you ever done this before?

964
01:29:03,704 --> 01:29:05,771
没有 从未做过
No, I haven't.

965
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,443
你确定要这样吗?
You sure you want to?

966
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:12,745
为什么不呢?
Why wouldn't I?

967
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:17,218
我不知道 你从未对我讲过你的任何事
I don't know. You haven't told me anything about yourself

968
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:19,853
然后现在就要让我进入你的大脑?
and now you're just gonna let me inside of your head?

969
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:23,523
- 你害怕吗?  - 你不害怕吗?
- Are you afraid of that?  - You're not?

970
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,459
不会
No.

971
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,103
恐高
Fear of heights.

972
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:11,470
我一点都不吃惊
I'm not surprised.

973
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,578
这不是真的
It's not real.

974
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,514
- 不  - 我们可以跳下去
- No.  - We could just jump.

975
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,148
分歧者才会跳下去
Divergent would jump.

976
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:23,184
无畏派会去那边的高楼
Dauntless would get to that building.

977
01:30:23,185 --> 01:30:25,253
如果你想通过 如果你想不被发现
If you want to pass, if you want to avoid discovery,

978
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:28,289
你必须按照无畏派的方式去做
you have to do everything the way a Dauntless would do it.

979
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:32,225
找一些工具 想办法幸存下来
You have to find some tool, some method to survive.

980
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:03,591
害怕被囚禁
Fear of confinement.

981
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:07,026
你得想办法解决 无畏派的人会怎么做?
You have to find a way of stopping it. What would a Dauntless do?

982
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:09,495
很好!
Good!

983
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:18,005
慢慢来
Take your time.

984
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:20,867
我开始有点享受在这个缩小的盒子了
I'm just enjoying myself in this shrinking box.

985
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:40,526
作为一个无畏派的战士 你必须服从命令 尽管你并不赞同
As a Dauntless soldier, you have to follow orders you don't always agree with.

986
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,930
她是谁?
Who is she?

987
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,036
她是无辜的
She's an innocent.

988
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,640
我必须杀了她
I have to kill her.

989
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:04,417
但这样我下不去手
But I can never do it.

990
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,753
除非看着别处
Unless I look away.

991
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,374
我们为什么在无私派这里?
Why are we in Abnegation?

992
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:33,045
最后的恐惧会最可怕
Your last fear is your worst fear.

993
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,650
它深居于灵魂深处
It lives in the deepest part of your mind.

994
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,127
马库斯曾经有个儿子
Marcus had a son.

995
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:50,031
叫什么名字?
What was his name?

996
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:53,999
托拜厄斯
Tobias.

997
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:59,071
托拜厄斯...
Tobias...

998
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,475
托拜厄斯...
Tobias...

999
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,781
托拜厄斯...
Tobias...

1000
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:09,749
我只想帮助你 让你更好一些
I'm just trying to help you to be better.

1001
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,153
不!
No!

1002
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:41,282
阿四?
Four?

1003
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:43,050
有四怕?
Four fears?

1004
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:45,551
以前是 现在也是
Four then, four now.

1005
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:51,056
我总是去那里 但我觉得永远不会消失的
I keep going in there, but I don't think you ever lose them.

1006
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:04,170
我能问你一件事吗?
Can I ask you something?

1007
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,307
当然
Sure.

1008
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,808
你的纹身是什么?
What's your tattoo?

1009
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,147
想看看吗?
You wanna see it?

1010
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,164
了不起
It's amazing.

1011
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:46,545
所有的派别
The factions.

1012
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:53,053
为什么把它们都纹在身上?
Why do you have all of them?

1013
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,688
我不想要只是某一派
I don't want to be just one thing.

1014
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,923
也做不到
I can't be.

1015
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:02,897
我想要勇敢 无私...
I want to be brave and I want to be selfless...

1016
01:35:02,898 --> 01:35:05,631
智慧 诚实和仁慈
Intelligent and honest and kind.

1017
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:11,036
尽管我仍在努力做到仁慈
Although I'm still working on "kind."

1018
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,804
我不想进展得太快
I don't wanna go too fast.

1019
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:49,241
没关系
It's okay.

1020
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,613
我已经习惯睡在地板上了
I've already got my spot on the floor.

1021
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:13,067
早上好
Morning.

1022
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:14,967
嘿
Hey.

1023
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,131
来 我给你看点东西
Come on. I'm gonna show you something.

1024
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,006
好的
Okay.

1025
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:36,989
看
Look.

1026
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:43,330
- 是智慧派  - 没错
- Erudite.  - Yeah.

1027
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:45,432
每天早上他们都在这里
They're here every morning.

1028
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:47,234
我观察他们好几个星期了
I've been watching them for weeks.

1029
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:49,136
他们在无畏派做什么?
What are they doing at Dauntless?

1030
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,304
装载补给 计算机
Loading in supplies. Computers.

1031
01:36:53,173 --> 01:36:55,307
还有这个
And these.

1032
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:58,513
这是什么?
What is it?

1033
01:36:58,514 --> 01:37:01,348
我觉得是某种认知发射剂 像血清一样注射
I think it's some kind of cognitive transmitter. You inject it like a serum.

1034
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:03,250
为什么?
Why?

1035
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:06,587
应该会让人更容易被控制
It's supposed to make you more susceptible to suggestion,

1036
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:10,823
但他们这么多的量 完全可以组建一支军队
but as many as they have, they could create an army.

1037
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:21,568
注意 所有新成员报到参加最后的测试
Attention, all initiates report for final testing.

1038
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,737
所有新成员报到参加最后的测试
All initiates report for final testing.

1039
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:34,081

You're ready.

1040
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:36,181
你可以做到
You can do this.

1041
01:37:57,438 --> 01:38:00,975
他们能在屏幕上看到你的幻觉
They can see your hallucinations on the screen.

1042
01:38:00,976 --> 01:38:03,077
所有你得按照无畏派的方式应对恐惧
So you get past your fears the way a Dauntless would,

1043
01:38:03,078 --> 01:38:04,645
但是要快
but do it quickly.

1044
01:38:04,646 --> 01:38:09,416
没错 如果我太优秀 他们会杀了我 如果太慢 我会死掉
Right. If I'm too good, then they'll kill me, and if I'm too slow, then I'll die.

1045
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:11,151
对
Right.

1046
01:38:11,152 --> 01:38:13,285

01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,532
哇哦 阿四!
Whoa. Four!

1051
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:43,770
住手! 阿四!
Stop! Four!

1052
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,371
你不是无畏派的吗?
Aren't you Dauntless?

1053
01:41:05,459 --> 01:41:07,861
别告诉我刚才你也都看到了
Please tell me that you weren't watching that.

1054
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:10,403
如果我说不 你会觉得好些吗?
Would you feel better if I said no?

1055
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,000
做得很好
You did well.

1056
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:17,069
现在...
Now...

1057
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:20,372
最后一个测试
One final test.

1058
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:28,881
你知道应该怎么做
You know what to do.

1059
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:31,385
什么?
What?

1060
01:41:31,386 --> 01:41:33,187
如果你想加入无畏派
If you want to be Dauntless.

1061
01:41:33,188 --> 01:41:34,987
不
No.

1062
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:37,256
下手吧
Do it.

1063
01:41:49,938 --> 01:41:52,638
你还好吗?
You all right?

1064
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:57,542
我觉得你做得不错 好吗?
That looked good to me, okay?

1065
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,280

无畏派的新成员

1077

1078
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,564
看见阿四了吗?
Do you see Four?

1079
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:54,835
没有
No.

1080
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:56,270

你应该站在队首的 但是...

1084
01:43:04,746 --> 01:43:06,645
我来给你帮个忙
I'll make it easy for you.

1085
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,617
很疼吧 哈?
Hurts like a bitch, huh?

1086
01:43:12,919 --> 01:43:15,387
现在你真正是我们的一员了
Now you're really one of us.

1087
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:37,342
嘿 怎么了...
Hey, what's...

1088
01:43:51,091 --> 01:43:52,826
派别比亲情重要
Faction before blood.

1089
01:43:52,827 --> 01:43:54,693
天啊
Oh, my God.

1090
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:11,778
他们能听见 也能看见我们
They can see and hear us.

1091
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:14,114
只是不会像正常人一样做出反应
They just don't process it the same way.

1092
01:44:14,115 --> 01:44:17,649
命令通过发射器下达
Commands come in through the transmitter.

1093
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,459
发生什么了?
What's goin' on?

1094
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:31,296
我们在干什么?
What are we doin'?

1095
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:37,402
是个分歧者
Divergent.

1096
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:44,711
嘿! 一切正常 没什么需要担心的
Hey! Everything's fine. There's nothing to worry about.

1097
01:47:15,795 --> 01:47:17,731
快点! 出来!
Hurry up! Move!

1098
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:24,170
无私派的领袖必须出示身份证明
Abnegation leaders must identify themselves.

1099
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:25,972
我们得找到我的父母
We need to find my parents.

1100
01:47:30,912 --> 01:47:33,647
继续走 你家在哪?
Just keep moving. Where's your house?

1101
01:47:33,648 --> 01:47:36,016
我们在找寻机密
We are looking for information.

1102

所有房屋都要搜查

1103

不要反抗 不会伤害你们的
Do not resist. You will not be hurt.

1104
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,328
妈妈? 爸爸?
Mom? Dad?

1105
01:47:51,865 --> 01:47:53,999
他们会去哪呢?
Where would they have gone?

1106
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:56,901
不知道
I don't know.

1107
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:02,974
你们不能这样! 快住手!
This can't happen here! Just stop it!

1108
01:48:08,848 --> 01:48:10,815
不要反抗
Do not resist.

1109
01:48:14,621 --> 01:48:16,923
所有无私派的人都要受审讯
All Abnegation will be questioned.

1110
01:48:16,924 --> 01:48:21,261
传说中的阿四... 变成了无脑的机器
The legendary Four... A mindless drone.

1111
01:48:21,262 --> 01:48:24,295
你曾经是班上第一 而现在...
You were first in your class. Now you're...

1112
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:26,831
一无是处
Nothing.

1113
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:43,783
怎么?
What?

1114
01:48:43,784 --> 01:48:45,817
你觉得他可能是...
Think he might be...

1115
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,554
只有一个办法可以知道
There's one way to find out.

1116
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:53,026
- 道别吧 混蛋  - 再见
- Say goodbye, asshole. - Goodbye.

1117
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,893
动一下就打死你!
Move and you die!

1118
01:48:55,295 --> 01:48:56,930
呆子?
The stiff?

1119
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:01,368
两个呆子
Two stiffs.

1120
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:03,136
两个要死的呆子
Two dead stiffs.

1121
01:49:03,137 --> 01:49:06,106
一个分歧者也不能放过
You can't let a single Divergent slip through.

1122
01:49:06,107 --> 01:49:09,843
- 还真是没错  - 她不会开枪的
- This is what happens. - She's not gonna shoot me.

1123
01:49:09,844 --> 01:49:12,211
你可能高估我的善心了
Think you might be overestimating my character.

1124
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:16,282
快跑!
Run!

1125
01:49:22,422 --> 01:49:24,882
- 你中枪了?  - 嗯
- You were hit?  - Yeah.

1126
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:27,193
就在这! 不许动!
Right there! Don't move!

1127
01:49:27,194 --> 01:49:28,975
放心武器
Drop your weapons.

1128
01:49:49,115 --> 01:49:51,716
是托拜厄斯·伊顿
Tobias Eaton.

1129
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:56,087
还有你 比阿特丽斯
And you, Beatrice.

1130
01:49:57,323 --> 01:49:59,959
我以为在你身上觉察到的是智慧
I thought it was intellect I was sensing in you.

1131
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:02,740
或许你没有自以为的那么聪明
Maybe you're not as smart as you think you are.

1132
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:04,998
你为什么要攻击这些无辜的人?
Why are you attacking all these innocent people?

1133
01:50:04,999 --> 01:50:06,866
无辜的人?
Innocent people?

1134
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:10,837
如果不加以管制 无私派就会破坏派别系统
Abnegation, if left unchecked, will destroy the faction system.

1135
01:50:10,838 --> 01:50:13,440
你们两个也是
Same can be said of both of you.

1136
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:17,477
必须有人阻止你们 否则和平就要被打破
Somebody has to stop you. If we don't, peace will be lost.

1137
01:50:17,478 --> 01:50:20,313
和平已经打破了 是你破坏的
It's already been lost. You destroyed it.

1138
01:50:20,314 --> 01:50:23,349
是人性破坏的
Human nature destroyed it.

1139
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:28,488
我们这些有能力预见的人有责任保护其它人
Those of us with the vision to see that are called upon to protect the rest.

1140
01:50:28,489 --> 01:50:33,460
我们会恢复和平 而这次会一直持续下去
We will restore the peace. And this time, it will last.

1141
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:35,794
如果你错了呢?
And what if you're wrong?

1142
01:50:42,335 --> 01:50:44,769
把他带过来
Bring him with us.

1143
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:52,577
她受伤了 任何结果都会失真
She's injured. Any results would be unclear.

1144
01:50:53,413 --> 01:50:56,354
- 可以处理掉她了  - 好的
- You can get rid of her. - All right.

1145
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:03,087
跪下!
Get down!

1146
01:51:08,762 --> 01:51:11,063
我们走 快!
Let's go. Come on!

1147
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:19,871
刚到的安保队 到五级移动司令部报到
Additional security teams, report to mobile command Level 5.

1148
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:59,177
比阿特丽斯!
Beatrice!

1149
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:01,813
- 妈妈? 妈!  - 比阿特丽斯
- Mom? Mom!  - Beatrice.

1150
01:52:02,115 --> 01:52:04,115
好了
Okay.

1151
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:11,756
好 我们得赶紧跑!
Okay, we gotta run!

1152
01:52:22,502 --> 01:52:25,003
您曾经是无畏派的
You were Dauntless.

1153
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:27,305
今天派上用场了
Served me well today.

1154
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:29,876
爸爸没事吧?
Is Dad okay?

1155
01:52:29,877 --> 01:52:33,179
嗯 他带着一队人去了门罗州 我们在那儿汇合
Yeah. He led a group over to Monroe and State. We're gonna meet him there.

1156
01:52:35,448 --> 01:52:37,181
快走!
Let's go!

1157
01:52:51,164 --> 01:52:53,131
发现目标!
Copy 1-9!

1158
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,952
威尔! 威尔!
Will! Will!

1159
01:53:17,657 --> 01:53:20,792
威尔! 威尔 住手! 住手!
Will! Will, stop! Stop!

1160
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:23,498
快住手!
Stop!

1161
01:53:25,499 --> 01:53:27,365
我...
I...

1162
01:53:34,908 --> 01:53:38,242
好了 快 宝贝 我们得走了
Okay. Come on, honey. We gotta go.

1163
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:58,197
我杀了他 我杀了他 是我杀了他
I killed him. I killed him. I killed him.

1164
01:53:58,198 --> 01:53:59,931
过来
Come here.

1165
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:06,638
好了
Okay.

1166
01:54:07,206 --> 01:54:09,407
我们去找你父亲
Let's go find your father.

1167
01:54:12,312 --> 01:54:14,413
- 掩护我  - 不
- Cover me.  - No.

1168
01:54:14,414 --> 01:54:16,781
我先走
I'll go.

1169
01:54:22,455 --> 01:54:24,656
发现目标 长官!
Got it, sir!

1170
01:54:27,962 --> 01:54:29,995
别停下! 别停!
Don't stop! Don't stop!

1171
01:54:29,996 --> 01:54:31,531
快走!
Go!

1172
01:54:36,569 --> 01:54:39,110
- 你没事吧?  - 嗯 没事 挺好的
- You okay?  - Yeah, good. I'm good.

1173
01:54:44,577 --> 01:54:47,278
好! 我们走! 安全了
Okay! Let's go! We're good.

1174
01:54:48,114 --> 01:54:49,248
妈妈?
Mom?

1175
01:54:49,249 --> 01:54:51,349
妈... 怎么了?
Mom... What is it?

1176
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,986
嘿...
Hey...

1177
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:57,991
妈!妈! 妈妈!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1178
01:54:57,992 --> 01:55:01,160
妈妈! 妈 不要!
Mom! Mom, no!

1179
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:03,995
妈妈! 妈妈!
Mom! Mom!

1180
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:09,367
妈? 妈妈! 醒来啊!
Mom? Mom! Mom, wake up!

1181
01:55:10,136 --> 01:55:12,036
妈!
Mom!

1182
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:15,073
天啊 妈妈!
Oh, my God, Mom!

1183
01:55:21,781 --> 01:55:23,649
住手! 住手!
Stop! Stop!

1184
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:30,955
我爱你 妈妈...
I love you, Mom...

1185
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:36,761
天啊!
Oh, my God!

1186
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:35,188
我父亲呢?
Where's my father?

1187
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:36,856
比阿特丽斯?
Beatrice?

1188
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,496
你妈妈呢?
Your mother?

1189
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:08,486
她救了我
She saved me.

1190
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:11,422
她为了救我死的
She saved me.

1191
01:57:11,757 --> 01:57:14,292
那她没有白白牺牲
Then it wasn't in vain.

1192
01:57:15,795 --> 01:57:17,862
我们得离开这里
We need to leave here.

1193
01:57:18,898 --> 01:57:21,299
外面有士兵吗?
Are there soldiers outside?

1194
01:57:25,505 --> 01:57:27,572
没有 安全的
No, it's clear.

1195
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:30,843
我应该相信你的
I should have believed you.

1196
01:57:30,844 --> 01:57:33,713
我一意识到问题就离开了
I left as soon as I realized.

1197
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:36,547
为什么会这样? 我不明白
Why is this happening? I don't understand.

1198
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,852
无畏派为什么要给智慧派卖命?
Why are Dauntless fighting for Erudite?

1199
01:57:39,853 --> 01:57:41,320
他们不知道自己在干嘛
They don't know what they're doing.

1200
01:57:41,321 --> 01:57:44,390
他们被控制了
They're under simulation.

1201
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:46,759
我们得唤醒他们 我得进入无畏派内部
We need to wake 'em up. I need to get into Dauntless.

1202
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,620
那是座堡垒
That's a fortress.

1203
01:57:48,861 --> 01:57:50,862
不可能成功的
It's not gonna happen.

1204
01:57:52,532 --> 01:57:55,199
我可以带你们进去
I can get us in there.

1205
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:04,275
准备好
Get ready.

1206
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:06,579
又要干嘛?
What now?

1207
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:09,046
你不会喜欢的
You're not gonna like it.

1208
01:58:28,868 --> 01:58:30,970
这个下面有张网
There's a net at the bottom.

1209
01:58:30,971 --> 01:58:33,237
别多想 只管跳
Don't think, just jump.

1210
01:58:43,983 --> 01:58:45,685
没事吧?
Are you good?

1211
01:58:45,686 --> 01:58:47,618
都没事吧?
Good?

1212
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:50,988
我们走
Let's go.

1213
01:58:56,596 --> 01:58:58,629
等一下
Wait here.

1214
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:06,872
趴到墙上
Against the wall.

1215
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:09,206
趴墙上!
Against the wall!

1216
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:13,946
你怎么是清醒的?
How are you awake?

1217
01:59:13,947 --> 01:59:16,249
因为我比你聪明
Because I'm smarter than you.

1218
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,650
而他们需要我
And they need me.

1219
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:19,685
控制中心在哪里?
Where are they controlling it from?

1220
01:59:19,686 --> 01:59:22,355
我为什么要告诉你? 反正你又不会开枪的
Why would I tell you that? It's not like you're gonna shoot me.

1221
01:59:22,356 --> 01:59:24,557
为什么你们都这么说?
Why do people keep saying that?

1222
01:59:27,761 --> 01:59:30,302
控制中心在哪里?
Where are they controlling it from?

1223
01:59:36,636 --> 01:59:39,177
你非得开枪打他吗?
Did you really need to shoot him?

1224
01:59:39,572 --> 01:59:41,874
每浪费一分钟 就会有无私派的人死去
Every minute we waste, another Abnegation dies

1225
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:44,310
无畏派的人变成凶手
and another Dauntless becomes a murderer.

1226
01:59:44,311 --> 01:59:46,644
彼得 我们走
Peter, let's go.

1227
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:03,429
是这儿 对不对?
That's it, isn't it?

1228
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:04,764
对
Yeah.

1229
02:00:04,765 --> 02:00:06,599
我见过珍宁进去
I've seen Jeanine go in there.

1230
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,300
她就是在这儿控制大家的
That's where she's controlling it from.

1231
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:24,482
如你所说 一秒钟也不能浪费
Like you said, there isn't a second to waste.

1232
02:00:29,488 --> 02:00:32,057
爸爸 不!
Dad, no!

1233
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,726
爸爸...
Dad...

1234
02:00:33,727 --> 02:00:35,061
不惜一切代价...
Do whatever it takes...

1235
02:00:35,062 --> 02:00:36,929
嘿!
Hey!

1236
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:19,270
看着伽勒 我先进去
Watch Caleb. I'm going in there.

1237
02:02:10,956 --> 02:02:13,324
嘿 嗨
Hey. Hi.

1238
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:29,473
阿四...
Four...

1239
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:32,978
阿四... 阿四 是我 你被控制了
Four... Four, it's me. You're in a SIM.

1240
02:02:32,979 --> 02:02:35,446
他听不到你说话
He can't hear you.

1241
02:02:36,715 --> 02:02:38,684
很神奇 对吧?
Amazing, isn't it?

1242
02:02:38,685 --> 02:02:41,187
我们以为称之为人的一切
Everything we think of that makes up a person,

1243
02:02:41,188 --> 02:02:44,590
思想 感情 过往...
thoughts, emotions, history...

1244
02:02:44,591 --> 02:02:46,592
都被化学物抹掉了
All wiped away by chemistry.

1245
02:02:46,593 --> 02:02:47,693
阿四
Four.

1246
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:49,727
他已经不是他自己了
He's gone.

1247
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:51,864
这样我们更安全
And we're all safer for it.

1248
02:02:51,865 --> 02:02:54,767
更安全? 怎么就更安全了?
Safer? How are we safer?

1249
02:02:54,768 --> 02:02:56,936
派别体系的天才之处
The brilliance of the faction system

1250
02:02:56,937 --> 02:02:59,171
就是对派别的服从会把
is that conformity to the faction removes the threat

1251
02:02:59,172 --> 02:03:02,875
能行驶自由意志的人构成的威胁消除
of anyone exercising their independent will.

1252
02:03:02,876 --> 02:03:05,709
分歧者威胁到了这种体系
Divergents threaten that system.

1253
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,583
别误会
Don't get me wrong.

1254
02:03:10,584 --> 02:03:13,652
你的反抗和拒绝被归类
There's a certain beauty in your resistance,

1255
02:03:13,653 --> 02:03:16,255
有些许美感
your defiance of categorization.

1256
02:03:16,256 --> 02:03:19,223
但这是我们无法承受的美
But it's a beauty we can't afford.

1257
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:35,241
阿四 是我 是我
Four, it's me. It's me.

1258
02:03:35,242 --> 02:03:37,708
拜托 阿四 看着我 看着我
Please, Four, look at me. Look at me.

1259
02:03:57,930 --> 02:03:59,964
阿四! 是我啊!
Four! It's me!

1260
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:30,427
阿四 住手!
Four, stop!

1261
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:32,896
停下!
Stop!

1262
02:04:33,632 --> 02:04:35,432
停下...
Stop...

1263
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:38,836
阿四... 求你...
Four... Please...

1264
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:47,745
没事的 没事的 我爱你 没关系
It's okay, it's okay. I love you. It's okay.

1265
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:53,884
没关系
It's okay.

1266
02:04:54,186 --> 02:04:56,587
我爱你 没事的
I love you. It's okay.

1267
02:05:02,061 --> 02:05:03,961
阿四 看着我 看着我
Four, look at me. Look at me.

1268
02:05:06,599 --> 02:05:09,134
是我 是我
It's me. It's me.

1269
02:05:09,135 --> 02:05:12,002
是我 是我啊
It's me. It's me.

1270
02:05:20,713 --> 02:05:22,413
特丽丝...
Tris...

1271
02:05:27,086 --> 02:05:28,886
动手吧
Go.

1272
02:05:31,857 --> 02:05:33,624
迅速搞定
Finish it.

1273
02:06:09,428 --> 02:06:11,128
救命!
Help!

1274
02:06:14,933 --> 02:06:16,834
嘿!
Hey!

1275
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,979
关闭系统
Shut it down.

1276
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:28,746
不
No.

1277
02:06:43,128 --> 02:06:44,963
我不会再说第二遍 快点!
I am not gonna ask you again. Do it!

1278
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:46,932
关闭系统!
Shut it down!

1279
02:06:46,933 --> 02:06:49,794
我很敬佩你甘愿为信仰牺牲...
I admire you willing to die for what you believe...

1280
02:06:50,035 --> 02:06:52,002
但我也一样
but so am I.

1281
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,107
你下不了手 对吧?
You can't do it, can you?

1282
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:34,446
或许你没有自己想得那么无畏
Maybe you're not quite as Dauntless as you thought you were.

1283
02:07:34,447 --> 02:07:36,880
你说得对
You're right.

1284
02:07:37,883 --> 02:07:39,752
我没有
I'm not.

1285
02:07:39,753 --> 02:07:41,685
因为我是分歧者
I'm Divergent.

1286
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:54,998
现在关闭系统清除程序
Now shut it down and wipe the program.

1287
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:25,798
控制终止
Simulation abort.

1288
02:08:25,799 --> 02:08:28,340
系统全面关闭
System-wide shutdown.

1289
02:08:36,141 --> 02:08:38,175
不... 不...
No... No...

1290
02:08:40,512 --> 02:08:42,679
不!
No!

1291
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:52,224
别误会
Don't get me wrong.

1292
02:08:52,225 --> 02:08:54,885
你的反抗还有些许美感
There's a certain beauty to your resistance.

1293
02:09:02,601 --> 02:09:04,169
特丽丝...
Tris...

1294
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:06,837
现在一级封锁启动
Lockdown now in effect.

1295
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:09,106
好了 快走!
All right, let's move!

1296
02:09:10,008 --> 02:09:12,142
我们得走了 立刻
We gotta go. Now.

1297
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:20,083
托拜厄斯
Tobias.

1298
02:09:21,486 --> 02:09:24,121
我们得继续走
We need to keep moving.

1299
02:09:32,331 --> 02:09:34,231
好 快走!
All right, move!

1300
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:50,213
儿子!
Son!

1301
02:09:59,892 --> 02:10:01,360
我能行!
I got it!

1302
02:10:01,361 --> 02:10:03,193
我知道
I know you do.

1303
02:10:18,977 --> 02:10:21,397
我爸妈今天都死了
My mom and dad died today.

1304
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:26,251
他们走了
They're gone.

1305
02:10:26,252 --> 02:10:28,020
我知道
I know.

1306
02:10:28,021 --> 02:10:30,320
但他们爱你 特丽丝
But they loved you, Tris.

1307
02:10:32,157 --> 02:10:34,493
对他们来说 这是最好的证明方法
For them, there was no better way to show you.

1308
02:10:40,565 --> 02:10:42,501
现在我们什么都没了
Now we have nothing.

1309
02:10:42,502 --> 02:10:45,102
我们没有家 没有派别...
We have no home, no faction...

1310
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:52,929
我都不知道自己是谁了
I don't even know who I am anymore.

1311
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:01,318
我很清楚你是谁
I know exactly who you are.

1312
02:11:02,321 --> 02:11:04,354
你确定吗?
You sure about that?

1313
02:11:05,524 --> 02:11:08,191
对 非常确定
Yeah, I'm very sure.

1314
02:11:11,163 --> 02:11:13,030
过来
Come here.

1315
02:11:25,677 --> 02:11:28,180
我们现在和无派别的人一样了
We're like the Factionless now.

1316
02:11:28,181 --> 02:11:31,149
我们把一切都抛下了
We've left everything behind,

1317
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:34,418
但我们找到了自我和彼此
but we found ourselves and each other.

1318
02:11:36,088 --> 02:11:39,624
明日我们或许还要战斗
Tomorrow we may have to fight again,

1319
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:43,028
但现在 我们会坐着火车到终点...
but, for now, we'll ride the train to the end of the line...

1320
02:11:43,029 --> 02:11:46,263
然后纵身一跃
and then we'll jump.
