00:32:33,238 --> 00:32:34,406
I was afraid you wouldn't.

517
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:36,274
Why?

518
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,078
Oh, you know.
After last night...

519
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:42,446
I'm sorry, Cindy.

520
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:18,717
About time.

521
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,617
You wouldn't mind taking your
hands out of your pockets,
would you, pop?

522
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:25,757
How about that?

523
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:32,131
Kind of generous,
aren't you, pop?

525
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,035
You're off your rocker.

526
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,603
Not that we ain't thankful.

527
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:40,139
Only you don't really want us

00:33:40,172 --> 00:33:42,207

to sleep or
something, do you?

529
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:44,809
Kobish, go out
and check that car.

530
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,179
This guy's getting
ideas every minute.

531
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,489
Maybe there's coppers
hiding in the backseat.

532
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:49,513
You check it.

533
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,251
Hal!
Yeah, Glenn?

534
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:54,153
Look at that car.
I'll cover you.

535
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:55,387
All right, pop.
In there.

536
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:01,360
Over there.

You're working your
headpiece overtime,
but you're not a bad guy.

541
00:34:32,624 --> 00:34:34,193
Your woman's waiting.

542
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,235
Here's a guy ain't
yellow, Kobish.

543
00:34:43,335 --> 00:34:44,736
I taught him, didn't I, Hal?

544
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,205
Yeah, you taught me everything.

545
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:47,806
That's right.
Everything.

546
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,475
Except how to live
in a house like this.

547
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,402
Darling, it's such
a short time now.

548
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,471
Less than three hours.

549
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,873
All they'll have is the car.

550
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,475
Even that's insured.

551
00:35:25,644 --> 00:35:27,355
As soon as they've gone,
you'll pick up the phone?

552
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:28,780
Yeah. Sure.

553
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,249
Dan, what are you thinking?

554
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,583
Nothing, dear.

555
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:35,520
What, Dan?
You're right, Ellie.
It'll soon be over.

556
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,821
No, there's something else.

557
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:39,524
They'll leave.
You'll pick up...

558
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,419
They can't let you
do that, can they?
Ellie...

00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:44,463
How can he stop it?
He can't, dear.

560
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:46,265
He must have a plan.

561
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:50,502
I know.

562
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,802
I know what
you're thinking.
Don't imagine things, Ellie.

563
00:35:53,605 --> 00:35:55,274
They'll have to take someone.

565
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:08,353

I just explained to your mother.

568
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:16,828
Please, don't let them
take me along.

569
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,863
They're not going to
take you or anyone.

570
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:20,765
I won't let them.

571
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:22,301
How are you gonna stop them?

572
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:26,905
I'll stop them.
I'll find a way.
I'll stop them.

573
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,608
Get under
the covers, darling.
Go back to sleep.

574
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:33,478
I just had a silly idea,
that's all.

575
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:36,448
Those men hadn't even
thought of that.

576
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,605
Good night, Chuck.

577
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,425
You had me so balled up, Cindy.

578

579
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:24,363
What? What do
you know?

00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:25,464
It's your father, isn't it?

581
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:28,032
I know how he feels about me.

582
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:32,537
Well, I'm going to
have it out with him.

583
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,806
No! No, Chuck. No.

584
00:37:34,906 --> 00:37:37,409
The lights are still on.
He must be up.
I said no.

585
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:39,678
It's...
It's not that at all.

586

searched yet.

Stay up there,

off that easy.

01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:19,842
She didn't recognize you.

1031
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:21,711
He's right, Kobish.

1032
01:09:21,811 --> 01:09:23,346
Hilliard took
her mind off of you.

1033
01:09:23,446 --> 01:09:25,415
Had her in
a real sweat. Pop...

1034
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,717
Gotta hand it to you.

1035
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:29,586
You'd have made a great con man.

1036
01:09:29,686 --> 01:09:31,288
What about the old
guy in the truck?

1037
01:09:31,321 --> 01:09:32,465
He ain't picking up
no more trash.

1038
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:33,723
Tailed?
Nah.

1039
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,425
Mr. Patterson...

1040
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:38,295
He saw their car in the garage.

1041
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:45,835
GRIFFIN:
Hey, listen to this.

1042
01:09:47,003 --> 01:09:50,340
"Dear Miss Swift,
bring help right away.

1043
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,609
"There are men
in the house with guns.

1044
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:54,711
"They are criminals."

1045
01:09:54,811 --> 01:09:56,613
Kid's a good speller, pop.

1046
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:58,615
(SOBS)

1047
01:09:59,982 --> 01:10:01,651
Crying department's
upstairs, lady.

1048
01:10:04,421 --> 01:10:05,722
(CRYING)

1049
01:10:05,822 --> 01:10:07,390
Griffin, it came.

1050
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:10,860
Afternoon mail.
Yeah?

1051
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,929
How could it?
It wasn't mailed
till this morning.

1052
01:10:14,997 --> 01:10:16,533
You...
Take it easy.

1053
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:22,505
Only it ain't
enough, pop.
Thanks anyway.

1054
01:10:24,341 --> 01:10:25,375
Hey, Glenn.

1055
01:10:26,343 --> 01:10:27,586
That's enough for us.
Let's blow.

1056
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:29,245
Tomorrow.

1057
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:31,714
Why are you crowding it?
Why go on taking
these chances?

1058
01:10:31,814 --> 01:10:34,660
I kind of like taking chances.
You don't take chances,
you might as well be dead.

1059
01:10:34,684 --> 01:10:36,386
Yeah. That's what
you're going to be,

1060
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:38,488
all of us if this goes on, dead.

1061
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,561
Oh, I'll take
the .38 now, Kobish.

1062
01:10:46,963 --> 01:10:49,432
I kind of like
the feel of it, Griffin.

1063
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:55,772
Clickety clickety click, pop.

1064
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:57,374
Don't work it overtime.

1065
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,541
Griffin...

1066
01:10:59,108 --> 01:11:00,843
When you leave here,

1067
01:11:00,943 --> 01:11:02,545
if that time ever comes...

1068
01:11:02,645 --> 01:11:04,547
Watch your manners.

1069
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:07,517
You know I'm going
to pick up the phone
and call the police.

1070
01:11:07,617 --> 01:11:09,552
Oh, now, pop,
you wouldn't do
a thing like that.

1071
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:11,388
What'll you do about it?

1072
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:13,823
Rip it out.

1073
01:11:13,923 --> 01:11:15,592
There's one next door.

1074
01:11:17,594 --> 01:11:19,028
What's on your mind?

1075
01:11:20,096 --> 01:11:22,465
I know what
you're planning, Griffin.

1076
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:26,035
You're not taking anyone along.

1077
01:11:27,604 --> 01:11:30,072
Say, that's not a bad idea.

1078
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:32,308
I never thought
of that.
You thought of it.

1079
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:33,476
All the way.

1080
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,712
I tell you what, pop.

1081
01:11:35,812 --> 01:11:38,615
You give us a fair shake,
we'll give you a fair shake.

1082
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:40,559
Then, if the dough gets here,
we'll take you with us.

1083
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:41,951
Just you.

1084
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:44,521
Nothing happens,
we ain't followed,

1085
01:11:44,621 --> 01:11:47,323
you get out
and walk home.
That's a deal, Griffin.

1086
01:11:47,424 --> 01:11:48,625
Sure, pop.

1087
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:49,926
A deal's a deal.

1088
01:11:50,026 --> 01:11:51,794
In the meantime,

1089
01:11:51,894 --> 01:11:53,463
don't get ulcers.

1090
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:05,341
I know what's
eating you, kid.
I'll tell you what.

1091
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:07,644
We'll take the girl
along just for you.

1092
01:12:09,145 --> 01:12:11,448
Is that what
you call a fair shake?

1093
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:13,983
Guys like Hilliard
ever give you
a fair shake?

1094
01:12:17,854 --> 01:12:19,589
I'll take the automatic now.

1095
01:12:21,558 --> 01:12:22,792
Get Kobish's...

1096
01:12:22,892 --> 01:12:24,661
I'm hanging on to this one.

1097
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:46,382
WAITRESS:
Two burgers, no onions.

1098
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:47,984
COOK: Two burgers,
no onions.

1099
01:12:48,084 --> 01:12:50,753
All the main roads are covered.

1100
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:52,121
It'll be dark in half an hour.

1101
01:12:52,221 --> 01:12:54,023
Tom, I want this
whole area combed,

1102
01:12:54,123 --> 01:12:55,925
every one of
the trash man's
customers.

1103
01:12:56,025 --> 01:12:58,728
Knock on every door
and report it...

1104
01:12:58,828 --> 01:13:01,598
Say, there ain't going
to be no shooting
here, is there?

1105
01:13:01,698 --> 01:13:04,100
No, no, no.
Just get us some
coffee, will you?

1106
01:13:06,168 --> 01:13:08,004
Report anything
unusual, anything.

1107
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:09,939
And especially
the garages, you hear?

1108
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:11,608
That's police talk, lad.

1109
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:14,511
This just came
into the city
police station.

1110
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:16,513
The bellhop's given
six different descriptions

1111
01:13:16,579 --> 01:13:18,491
of the man who tipped him.
A 5-spot to deliver it.

1112
01:13:18,515 --> 01:13:20,517
All we know
for sure is the man
was wearing clothes.

1113
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:25,154
"To the police...
Innocent people
will be in the house

1114
01:13:25,254 --> 01:13:28,825
"or automobile with
the three fugitives you want.

1115
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:30,426
"If you shoot,
you'll be responsible

1116
01:13:30,527 --> 01:13:33,095
"for the lives
of people who have
done no harm.

1117
01:13:33,195 --> 01:13:34,435
"To attempt to trace this letter

1118
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:36,051
"will only endanger
those same people."

1119
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,068
No signature.

1120
01:13:39,168 --> 01:13:41,203
Well, now we know.

1121
01:13:41,303 --> 01:13:43,706
Nah, it's a blind.
That letter's
no blind.

1122
01:13:43,806 --> 01:13:44,974
The idiot.

1123
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:47,944
Doesn't he know
you can't play ball
with savages like that?

1124
01:13:48,044 --> 01:13:49,846
Let's get moving,
Winston.
Fredericks,

1125
01:13:49,946 --> 01:13:51,080
what are you going to do?

1126
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,115
Follow your instructions.
Knock on a few doors.

1127
01:13:53,215 --> 01:13:55,451
That letter pretty well proves
they're here someplace.

1128
01:13:55,552 --> 01:13:57,854
I'm countermanding those orders.

1129
01:13:57,954 --> 01:13:59,656
Bard, you can't
put off a showdown.

1130
01:13:59,756 --> 01:14:01,791
Nobody wants a showdown
any more than I do,

1131
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:05,027
but we can't get
the poor slob's
family massacred.

1132
01:14:05,127 --> 01:14:07,129
Listen, you frisky
young punk,
and listen good.

1133
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:09,732
Pity is a luxury
your badge
doesn't afford.

1134
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,868
Did you hear that?

1135
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:13,903
Is it any wonder
the guy doesn't
sign his name,

1136
01:14:14,003 --> 01:14:15,723
why he doesn't trust
the police to help him?

1137
01:14:15,772 --> 01:14:16,973
What do you propose, Jess?

1138
01:14:17,073 --> 01:14:19,942
I propose keeping
those prowl cars
off the streets now.

1139
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:21,578
Bury 'em.

1140
01:14:21,678 --> 01:14:23,689
Then Tom and me
will cruise around and
see what we can spot.

1141
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,715
Oh, fine.
In the meantime,
they slip out.

1142
01:14:25,815 --> 01:14:28,015
There's plenty of
side streets, alleys...
Block them all.

1143
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,019
It's too big an area for that!

1144
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:31,788
If they slip through,
your name is mud.

1145
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:33,890
And yours, too.

1146
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:38,094
Get some equipment
moved in here.
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

1147
01:14:38,194 --> 01:14:40,597
Take my car, Jess.
It's not marked.

1148
01:14:40,697 --> 01:14:42,937
Better get some riot guns,
tear gas brought up.
The works.

1149
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:51,240
Wait a minute, Cindy.
Please, Chuck.

1150
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:55,511
Stay away from here, will you?

1151
01:14:55,612 --> 01:14:58,180
I don't want to see
you anymore,
do you hear?

1152
01:15:14,196 --> 01:15:15,665
DAN: Cindy!

1153
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,302
Didn't I tell you...
I couldn't help it, Dad.

1154
01:15:20,402 --> 01:15:22,338
Clickety clickety click, pop.

1155
01:15:23,205 --> 01:15:24,841
You've only got one trouble.

1156
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,909
You don't know
when you're licked.

1157
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:28,944
Hal,

1158
01:15:29,912 --> 01:15:32,181
the spitfire had
to come back to you.

1159
01:15:34,717 --> 01:15:36,919
You didn't blab
to the boyfriend,
did you?

1160
01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:38,988
Chuck knows nothing.

1161
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:41,891
Then what's
he doing still
sitting out there?

1162
01:15:41,991 --> 01:15:43,726
Get back on that window.

1163
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,228
If you pulled a fast one...

1164
01:15:49,398 --> 01:15:50,967
Chuck doesn't know anything.

1165
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,681
Kobish.

1166
01:16:06,716 --> 01:16:08,718
Hey, Glenn.
Here he comes again.

1167
01:16:13,823 --> 01:16:14,857
Kobish!

1168
01:16:25,267 --> 01:16:26,869
(CAR DRIVES AWAY)

1169
01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:28,337
Glenn, this can't go on.

1170
01:16:28,437 --> 01:16:29,739
First the old man in the truck,

1171
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:32,141
then the schoolteacher,
now this guy out here.

1172
01:16:32,241 --> 01:16:34,243
Somebody's going to get wise.

1173
01:16:35,077 --> 01:16:36,879
I'm not sticking any longer.

1174
01:16:39,882 --> 01:16:41,350
Kobish, watch them.

1175
01:16:42,919 --> 01:16:44,320
All right, beat it.

1176
01:16:51,728 --> 01:16:53,395
I'm getting out, Glenn, now.

1177
01:16:53,495 --> 01:16:56,799
Don't lose
your head, kid.
We're accessories now, Glenn.

1178
01:16:56,899 --> 01:16:58,911
I'm not going to the chair
'cause that ape in there
got trigger-happy.

1179
01:16:58,935 --> 01:17:00,770
The dough will be
here in the morning.

1180
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:03,039
What good's the dough gonna
do you in the death house?

1181
01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:04,841
Listen, kid.
It's that gal.

1182
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:06,275
She's got you all messed up.

1183
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:07,810
Ain't I always learned ya?

1184
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,645
You want something, take it.

1185
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:11,323
Your brother
knows it's not
that simple, Griffin.

1186
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:12,347
I'll make it that simple!

1187
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:13,950
You stay out of this!

1188
01:17:16,018 --> 01:17:17,018
Hal gets what he wants.

1189
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:19,388
I doubt it, Glenn.

1190
01:17:19,488 --> 01:17:21,023
I doubt if I ever will.

1191
01:17:26,062 --> 01:17:27,663
Listen, you yellow little punk!

1192
01:17:27,764 --> 01:17:29,441
They'll have
you back in stir
in less than an hour!

1193
01:17:29,465 --> 01:17:30,933
I can take care
of myself.
Since when?

1194
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:33,035
Since right now!

1195
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:35,805
I don't advise
your leaving here

01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,358
You can hightail it
out of here and maybe
say a prayer,

1367
01:27:46,382 --> 01:27:48,083
but nothing else, you hear?
Nothing!

Where's the phone?

01:28:05,601 --> 01:28:07,002

I'm in a garage.

I said I've been thinking
about everything.

1381
01:28:56,552 --> 01:28:57,919
I've got to talk to your father.

1382
01:28:58,019 --> 01:28:59,588
I know he doesn't like me,

1383
01:28:59,688 --> 01:29:01,433
but let's get
the whole thing
straightened out now.

1384
01:29:01,457 --> 01:29:03,124
No! No, not tonight,
Chuck.

1385
01:29:03,959 --> 01:29:05,060
Uh...

1386
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,062
Mother and Dad have company.

1387

They're playing cards.

01:29:10,466 --> 01:29:12,668
Oh. I don't care, Cindy.
I'm coming over.

1389
01:29:13,735 --> 01:29:15,571
You're not playing
cards, are you?

1390

No, I...

1391
01:29:17,506 --> 01:29:18,850
Then you come out
when I honk the horn.

1392
01:29:18,874 --> 01:29:20,576
If you don't, I'll come in.

What does he know?

1394

You ain't going nowhere.

01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:48,504
You heard him.
He'll come in here.

We don't want nobody
else in here now.

He means your old lady
is gonna be with us
in the car when we blow.

That means any cops

any guns go off,

What I'm asking, Bard,

1455
01:36:37,012 --> 01:36:39,414
is how come you let
so much time get away
and did nothing?

1456

Gentlemen, this is
Mr. Hilliard.

01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:44,552

to his house.

How did
I slip up?
You didn't.

is dead.
He had your gun.

1461

I just came on,
Mr. Hilliard.
I'm taking over.

1462
01:36:55,997 --> 01:36:58,433
Did you write this letter?

1463
01:36:58,533 --> 01:37:00,401
If you read that,
you know
the whole thing,

1464
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:02,103
and that you can't use these.

1465
01:37:02,203 --> 01:37:05,006
Mister, you're
not telling us how
to do our job?

1466
01:37:10,045 --> 01:37:11,565
If you'd come to us
in the first place,

1467
01:37:11,612 --> 01:37:13,081
you wouldn't be in this fix.

1468
01:37:13,181 --> 01:37:14,849
I'd have been in it sooner.

1469
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:16,584
Nobody's blaming you,
Mr. Hilliard.

1470
01:37:16,684 --> 01:37:17,986
Nobody in his right mind.

1471
01:37:18,954 --> 01:37:20,397
Are they both still
in the house?
Yeah.

1472
01:37:20,421 --> 01:37:22,490
How many guns?
One, with three bullets.

1473
01:37:23,324 --> 01:37:24,659
Well, that helps.

1474
01:37:25,593 --> 01:37:27,528
Also my wife and son.

1475
01:37:27,628 --> 01:37:30,231
Now, no one wants
to see innocent people
hurt, Mr. Hilliard.

1476
01:37:30,331 --> 01:37:32,000
Then get away from here.

1477
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,945
Take your men, your guns,
your lights, and get away!

1478
01:37:33,969 --> 01:37:35,679
There's been
a murder committed
in my county.

1479
01:37:35,703 --> 01:37:36,981
The papers are
starting to scream.

1480
01:37:37,005 --> 01:37:38,573
I don't care.
What do I care?

1481
01:37:38,673 --> 01:37:40,073
My family's
in that house
over there!

1482
01:37:40,108 --> 01:37:41,718
You've got to consider
what those men can do

1483
01:37:41,742 --> 01:37:44,012
if they bluff their way
out of that trap.

1484
01:37:44,112 --> 01:37:45,880
You don't want them
to kill a lot of others.

1485
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:48,883
I don't want them
or you to kill
my wife or boy.

1486
01:37:48,984 --> 01:37:50,986
That's first.
With me, that's first!

1487
01:37:51,987 --> 01:37:53,989
What do you suggest,
Mr. Hilliard?

1488
01:37:54,055 --> 01:37:56,424
I've got several thousand
dollars in my pocket.

1489
01:37:56,524 --> 01:37:58,559

they're not coming out.

What am I supposed to do,

1491
01:38:01,396 --> 01:38:02,606
sit up here and watch it happen?

1492
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:04,299
It's plain suicide
to go back there, now.

1493
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:07,035
Sheriff, there comes
a time when that fact
just doesn't enter in!

1494
01:38:07,135 --> 01:38:09,346
BARD: Masters, give him
a chance. Let him take
the dough in.

1495
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:11,148
What's the difference
does it make whether you
get Griffin now

1496
01:38:11,172 --> 01:38:13,574
or when he comes out?
Just so you get him.

1497
01:38:13,674 --> 01:38:15,610
You'll win your election.

1498
01:38:16,544 --> 01:38:19,447
You're out of it.
You don't go back.

1499
01:38:19,547 --> 01:38:21,682
The minute you're
ready, we move in.

1500
01:38:36,297 --> 01:38:39,467
Gentlemen, since this
is a federal case,
it's my decision.

1501
01:38:41,202 --> 01:38:43,071
You want a gun,
Mr. Hilliard?

1502
01:38:46,507 --> 01:38:48,076
No, thanks.
They search you?

1503
01:38:48,176 --> 01:38:49,544
Yeah.

blows up in your face,

1505
01:39:00,221 --> 01:39:02,099
I want a public statement
exonerating my office.

1506
01:39:02,123 --> 01:39:03,291
You'll get it.

1507
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:06,161
I'll take the gun.

(BULLETS CLATTERING)

1509
01:39:19,674 --> 01:39:21,309
An empty gun?
You crazy?

1510
01:39:22,243 --> 01:39:23,978
Maybe.

1511
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:25,346
But Griffin doesn't think so.

1512
01:39:25,446 --> 01:39:27,748
That's a pretty
long shot, isn't it?

1513
01:39:27,848 --> 01:39:30,551
I don't have
any short ones
in sight. Do you?

1514
01:39:31,486 --> 01:39:34,122
They're waiting for me.
Hilliard,

1515
01:39:34,222 --> 01:39:36,300
I'll give you 10 minutes
from the time you go
through that door.

1516
01:39:36,324 --> 01:39:37,425
And remember,

1517

we're playing it your way.

1518

Good luck, sir.

1519
01:39:48,636 --> 01:39:50,405
That gentleman's had it.

1520
01:39:50,505 --> 01:39:53,108
A man plays with dynamite,
he's gonna get it.

1521
01:39:57,778 --> 01:39:59,747
See that
he gets through.
Okay.

1522
01:41:17,192 --> 01:41:18,459

1524
01:41:19,827 --> 01:41:21,862
Stay with Ralphy,
and lock the door.

1525
01:41:21,962 --> 01:41:24,232
No! Before I let you go
with them, I'll scream!

1526
01:41:24,332 --> 01:41:25,633
I mean it!

Now fork over the dough!

I'll give it to you in the car.

1531
01:41:37,412 --> 01:41:39,247
You'll give it right now.

1532
01:41:39,347 --> 01:41:40,781
Get your hands up.

01:41:42,483 --> 01:41:43,718
Get them up!

1534
01:41:52,893 --> 01:41:55,230
I'll take that.
You'll take what?

1535
01:41:56,297 --> 01:41:57,898
(CHUCKLES)

1536
01:41:57,998 --> 01:42:01,536
You had it all doped out,
didn't you, Kobish?

1537
01:42:01,636 --> 01:42:04,439
Why, you
double-crossing rat!
Use your fat head.

1538
01:42:04,539 --> 01:42:06,407
Without me, you're cooked.

1539
01:42:06,507 --> 01:42:08,243
Here. Put this
in your pocket.

1540
01:42:08,309 --> 01:42:10,245
Forget your big ideas.

1541
01:42:10,345 --> 01:42:13,281
Okay. Let's roll.
Clickety clickety click.

1542
01:42:13,381 --> 01:42:14,625
You got to keep
trying, don't you, pop?

1543
01:42:14,649 --> 01:42:16,284
Right to the end.

1544
01:42:16,384 --> 01:42:17,552
Oh!

1545
01:42:17,652 --> 01:42:19,420
Ellie, go back in that room!

1546
01:42:21,622 --> 01:42:24,425
I'm ready, Griffin.
Yeah, but this gun
wasn't part of our deal.

1547
01:42:24,525 --> 01:42:26,594
Much as I appreciate it.
Dan, I meant
what I said.

1548
01:42:26,694 --> 01:42:27,895
Get in that room!

1549
01:42:27,995 --> 01:42:30,831
Lady, bring down
the kid. We're going
on a picnic.

1550
01:42:31,999 --> 01:42:34,302
Lock the door!
Knock it off, pop.

1551
01:42:37,772 --> 01:42:40,908
Now, didn't you
just hear me invite
the family to a picnic?

1552
01:42:41,008 --> 01:42:43,811
What are we
waiting for? I can
kick down that door.

1553
01:42:43,911 --> 01:42:46,481
I said I was
ready, Griffin.
I heard you,

1554
01:42:46,581 --> 01:42:48,182
but you're so full of ideas

1555
01:42:48,283 --> 01:42:49,693
that I'd feel better
in a car with lots

1556
01:42:49,717 --> 01:42:50,751
of people around me.

1557
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:52,520
Cover this wise guy.

1558
01:43:01,562 --> 01:43:03,431
Did you hear that?
What?

1559
01:43:08,603 --> 01:43:10,738
Hey, folks,
you don't want to
miss the fun.

1560
01:43:10,838 --> 01:43:12,340
Sounded like...

1561
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:15,976
GRIFFIN: Come on!

1562
01:43:16,076 --> 01:43:19,314
We're gonna be late
and all the ice cream's
going to be ate up.

1563
01:43:19,347 --> 01:43:21,782
What's going on
out there?
I don't know.

1564
01:43:22,717 --> 01:43:24,218
I thought I heard something.

1565
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:26,721
GRIFFIN: You want me
to kick the door down?

1566
01:43:26,821 --> 01:43:28,623
Okay, lady,
you just ain't smart.

1567
01:43:28,723 --> 01:43:30,491
You bring the coppers
back here?
No. No.

1568
01:43:30,591 --> 01:43:32,793
You're lying
in your teeth.
(GRIFFIN KICKING DOOR)

1569
01:43:49,644 --> 01:43:50,911
You crazy?

1570
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:57,518
I don't see nothing.
Might be hiding.

1571
01:43:58,085 --> 01:43:59,754
Could be the police.

1572
01:43:59,854 --> 01:44:03,558
GRIFFIN: Now, just do
as I say, lady, and junior
grows up to vote.

1573
01:44:03,658 --> 01:44:04,925
You out there!
Coppers!

1574
01:44:05,025 --> 01:44:06,894
We still got the Hilliards!

1575
01:44:07,695 --> 01:44:09,364

1577
01:44:12,733 --> 01:44:14,369
Oh, Dan!

1579
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:20,841

1580

Don't kill me!

1583

Ralphy!

1584

Dad! Dad!

1585
01:44:36,924 --> 01:44:38,793
Oh, he's got Ralph!

1586
01:44:38,893 --> 01:44:40,861
Go out the back door.
Get over to the Wallings.

1587
01:44:42,663 --> 01:44:44,832
Do as I say!

1588
01:44:44,932 --> 01:44:46,634
Ralphy's going to be all right.

1589
01:44:46,734 --> 01:44:48,403
Dad, hurry!
Go ahead!

1590
01:44:56,544 --> 01:44:57,544
Dad!

1591
01:45:00,548 --> 01:45:01,992
You're gonna get me
out of this, Hilliard.

1592
01:45:02,016 --> 01:45:04,536
Let go of the boy, Griffin.
Fat chance with
those cops out there.

1593
01:45:05,486 --> 01:45:07,622
If you want my help, Griffin,

1594
01:45:07,722 --> 01:45:08,989
you'll take your hands off him.

1595
01:45:13,461 --> 01:45:14,495
Okay.

1596
01:45:18,566 --> 01:45:20,701
You move, kid,
I'll blow
your head off.

1597

Ralph...

1598
01:45:25,706 --> 01:45:28,676
I want you to do exactly
what I tell you now.

1599
01:45:28,776 --> 01:45:30,645
This man is not
going to hurt you, son.

1600
01:45:30,745 --> 01:45:32,447
Just make a move, kid.
You'll find out.

1601
01:45:32,513 --> 01:45:35,516
Will you do exactly
as I say, Ralph?

1602
01:45:35,616 --> 01:45:38,052
Hilliard, you don't
know me if you think
I'm bluffing.

1603
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:40,655
Run!
Feel that?

1604
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:44,190
Run!

1605
01:45:45,125 --> 01:45:47,161
(CLICKING)
Out the back door.

1606
01:46:06,614 --> 01:46:08,082

Yes, we see him.

Mr. Hilliard,
are you all right?

1609
01:46:14,955 --> 01:46:16,691
Yes!
Stay where you are!

1610
01:46:24,131 --> 01:46:26,601
You ain't got it
in you, pop.
I got it in me.

1611
01:46:27,835 --> 01:46:29,203
You put it there.

1612
01:46:31,672 --> 01:46:32,707
What are you waiting for?

1613
01:46:34,008 --> 01:46:36,511
It's not going to be
that easy for you.

1614
01:46:37,277 --> 01:46:39,714
I want to tell you
about your brother.

1615
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,582
He's dead.

1616
01:46:42,683 --> 01:46:44,151
Full of police bullets.

1617
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,053
And you did it!

1618
01:46:48,723 --> 01:46:50,124
How does it feel?

1619
01:46:50,925 --> 01:46:52,560
How do you like it?

1620
01:46:55,696 --> 01:46:56,764
Go ahead.

1621
01:46:57,865 --> 01:46:59,233

1624
01:47:25,593 --> 01:47:26,627
Get out.

1625
01:47:28,062 --> 01:47:29,697

1632

Come ahead, Griffin.

1633
01:49:05,259 --> 01:49:07,361
Mr. Hilliard, keep away
from the front of the house.

1634
01:49:30,384 --> 01:49:33,187
Griffin, raise your
hands above your head

1635
01:49:33,287 --> 01:49:34,287
