1
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,191
- I'll get it.
- Some morning I'll catch that kid.

2
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,150
- If cows only knew how I hated them.
- What would they do?

3
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,791
<i>Hey, Ralphy!</i>

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,953
Bye, Mother. I'll be home late.
Scout meeting.

5
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,398
- Bye, Dream Witch.
- Goodbye, Pest.

6
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,870
- Ralphy...
- My name is Ralph, R-A-L-P-H.

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,033
There's no "Y" on the end.
I looked at my birth certificate.

8
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,191
Bye, now.

9
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,475
Mm... Ralph! Ralphy!

10
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,628
Ralphy, your bicycle!

11
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,713
I'll be late for the first bell!

12
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,314
Ralph, spelt R-A-L-P-H, considers
himself too old to kiss a man.

13
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,948
- Another milepost, Dan.
- Mm-hm.

14
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,680
They're sailing by pretty fast.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,310
Next, Cindy will be saying
she wants to get married.

16
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,278
I do, but he hasn't asked me.

17
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,910
- A-ha!
- Yet. A-ha.

18
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,629
- Dan.
- She's still a child.

19
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,076
Even though
she doesn't look like a child.

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,117
Huh?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,313
Cindy, try not to mention Chuck
to your father on the way to work.

22
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,471
All right, Mother.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,629
Darling, try not to mention
Chuck Wright to Cindy.

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,519
She's touchy
since she's been in love.

25
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,754
In love? That girl knows no more
about love than... Ralphy does.

26
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,956
Have a nice day, dear.

27
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,950
<i>The escape was
masterminded by Glenn Griffin.</i>

28
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,590
<i>He, his brother Hal
and another convict named Kobish</i>

29
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,911
<i>overpowered a guard
and fled without arousing suspición.</i>

30
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,356
<i>Griffin made headlines
here four years ago</i>

31
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,671
<i>when he deliberately shot a policeman,
then surrendered.</i>

32
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,709
<i>Enraged Deputy Sheriff Jesse Bard
slashed his gun across Griffin's face,</i>

33
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,871
<i>breaking his jaw.</i>

34
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,508
<i>Griffin swore to some day get even.</i>

35
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,550
Hi, Dutch.
Any of your relatives in there?

36
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,631
- Hi, Jesse.
- About time!

37
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,279
Overslept.

38
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,228
- What's the beauty contest?
- Routine questioning.

39
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,198
They had a prison break
at Terre Haute.

40
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,432
A lifer named Kobish,
brothers named Griffin.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,991
Griffin? When?

42
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,153
- Just before dawn.
- Why didn't you call me?

43
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,118
Call you? Why?

44
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,748
Dutch, get me Lieutenant Fredericks.

45
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,711
- Relax, Jesse. It's an FBI case.
- Who's this third one, this Kobish?

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,876
Kobish, Samuel. Aged 44. Male, white.
Six foot three, 260 pounds.

47
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,794
A loser with a record.
Makes my hair stand on end.

48
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,350
<i>- Fredericks on the line.
- What have you got?</i>

49
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,640
Nothing. They melted into the earth
as soon as they hit fresh air.

50
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,271
- Have you checked Griffin's girl?
- She left town three weeks ago.

51
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,432
We got road blocks
up and down the state.

52
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,591
Police are ripping buildings apart.

53
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,751
You don't know Griffin.

54
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,674
No road block's gonna stop him
coming back to Indianapolis.

55
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,789
Take the chip off your shoulder.
You want Griffin? Get him yourself.

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,234
- Griffin? Is he the one who...?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,391
He's the one.

58
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,118
Look at that. How about it, Glenn?

59
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,271
Yeah.

60
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,951
All right, I'm coming.

61
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,270
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I lost my way.

62
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,671
Would you direct me
to the Bowden Dairy?

63
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,832
There are no dairies close by...

64
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,992
Take it easy, lady! Easy, I said!

65
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,790
You scream and the kid'll come home
and find you in a pool of blood.

66
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,748
Better. Kobish, upstairs.

67
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,471
Where's the phone?

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,470
- Is that the only one?
- Extensión upstairs.

69
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,110
All clear.
There's a big car in the garage.

70
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,070
Keys to the car, lady. When I speak
to you, snap fast! Keys to the car.

71
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,710
- On the refrigerator.
- Get them, Hal. Check the car.

72
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,271
- Take the car, take anything!
- You stick with me, lady.

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,468
Nobody home but her.

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,150
Smart gal.

75
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,158
- How many bedrooms?
- Three. And two bathrooms!

76
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,314
Well... haven't had me a drink
in eight years!

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,549
- Where's the Liquor?
- Have a good cigar instead.

78
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,430
Keep an eye peeled out that side.
It's a library. Improve your mind.

79
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,993
Crude, ain't he?
Let's see the rest of the house.

80
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,995
The back stairs.

81
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,990
- The big car's ready but low on gas.
- Stick on that door.

82
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,628
- Oh, Hal.
- What?

83
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,839
Now, lady,
you and me got some business.

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,991
Come here.

85
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,554
- They had to pull something.
- How come we're just getting it?

86
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,711
This is Mr Carson, FBI.

87
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,839
How are you? It says
they beat up a farmer before dawn!

88
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,993
They left him in his barn out cold,
ripped out his telephone.

89
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,154
He staggered into a general store and
reported his car stolen. How are you?

90
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,233
Battered grey Sedan, 1941.
Did you put this on the air?

91
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,393
And give every amateur a crack at it?
We'd be flooded with phoney leads!

92
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,678
Then, we'll follow them all down.
What do you say, Carson?

93
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,630
The way I understand it,
you know Griffin better than anyone.

94
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,270
How about your taking over?
I'll string along.

95
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,479
OK. Let's find that car.

96
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,632
Repeat the description on air
every half-hour.

97
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,951
<i>Contact the police immediately if
you have information about this car.</i>

98
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,429
<i>Radio Station WTLI, Indianapolis.</i>

99
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,279
You paid this insurance on the 19th?

100
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,752
- Yes.
- Is that all the cash in the house?

101
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,390
My husband always says,
"Too much cash... "

102
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,599
He's right. It's never safe
to leave too much dough around.

103
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,830
<i>Tat-a-tat-tat!</i>

104
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,991
Knock it off!

105
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,390
- My guts are growling.
- Chew on this.

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,471
Maybe it slipped your mind. You
supposed to go some place tonight?

107
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,632
No. I've told you!
How many times...?

108
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,268
As many times as I say.

109
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,634
Are you sure you ain't forgetting
something? Like a gun in the house?

110
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,268
You got it hid from Junior.

111
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,188
You want me to let Kobish find it?

112
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,830
Put a gun in his paw
and his fingers get itchy.

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,230
He's only got half a brain.

114
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,110
Don't want nobody to get hurt.
Maybe you've got different ideas.

115
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,078
OK, I'll let him dig it out.

116
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,791
Wait!

117
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,991
I'm waiting.

118
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,556
Top shelf of my closet, in my room.
Behind the hat boxes.

119
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,711
- Hal!
- Yeah, Glenn?

120
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,189
Kobish, watch the back door.

121
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,628
- Yeah?
- Lady's got a present.

122
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,872
Top of her closet, back of the boxes.

123
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,033
Do you think you can talk on
the phone without busting into tears?

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,991
The phone!

125
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,119
Whom do you want me to call?

126
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,472
I always go for a dame with guts.

127
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,509
That's "whom" you're going to call.
A little lady with real guts.

128
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,673
Long distance. No double talk
and nobody gets hurt.

129
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,630
Mr James is calling Mrs James,
Atlantic 63389.

130
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,439
No, we don't write nothing down.

131
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,593
Atlantic 63389. Pittsburgh.

132
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,228
Pittsburgh, PA.

133
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,994
Operator, I want to place a call
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

134
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,789
Mrs James. Mr James is calling.

135
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,953
- Atlantic 6...
- 3389.

136
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,111
<i>...3389.</i>

137
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,517
Is that you, doll?
Don't talk now. Listen.

138
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,990
<i>- Get here as fast as you can.
- Indianapolis?</i>

139
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,951
Any trouble, call on the phone.
The number's... Broad Ripple 8493.

140
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,432
Address is 6459 North Preston.
Got it?

141
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,909
<i>- Yes.
- OK, doll.</i>

142
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,150
I'll look for you around midnight.

143
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,198
<i>- Only careful, see?
- I'll see.</i>

144
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,948
Got a customer, Dutch.

145
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,992
- You got a warrant?
- Got a warrant, Dutch?

146
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,628
- Fresh out of warrants.
- Where is she?

147
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,870
- Who?
- Where did she go?

148
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,477
- I want to see Sheriff Masters.
- Deputy Bard's in charge.

149
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,155
The gentleman wants to tell you
where Helen Miller went.

150
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,791
No rough stuff, Dutch.
Masters doesn't like rough stuff.

151
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,270
- Where's Sheriff Masters?
- In Michigan. Fishing.

152
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,671
- One coming.
- After you.

153
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,598
Dad, can't you go a little faster?

154
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,873
- I may not drive like your lawyer friend...
- Now, Dad!

155
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,033
Mother didn't say we couldn't talk
about him on the way home. How is he?

156
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,196
- I don't know. We had a fight.
- Oh, I'm crushed.

157
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,352
Nothing trivial, I hope.

158
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,910
Nothing serious. So sorry.

159
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,915
Uh-oh. Your mother
Left the car out again.

160
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,072
Open the garage door, will you, dear?

161
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,711
Close the door, folks.

162
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,471
Dan...

163
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,519
- That's being real sensible, mister.
- Ellie...

164
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,558
- I'm all right.
- Where's Ralphy?

165
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,872
- Not home yet.
- Stop pointing that gun at her.

166
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,475
- They left the door open.
- Shut it.

167
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,191
- The house is crawling with them.
- What are you doing here, Griffin?

168
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,434
- They're looking all over for you.
- They ain't looking here.

169
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,398
- What do you want?
- Take it easy.

170
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,438
- Why my house?
- Your break.

171
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,388
I like the location.
I like a house with a bike outside.

172
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,792
I love people with kids.
They don't take no chances.

173
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,794
Do you get it now, Hilliard? You can
get brave any time you feel like it.

174
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,951
You might get away with it.

175
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,113
But I ain't saying what's
going to happen to the others.

176
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,068
- How long?
- You ain't dumb, are you?

177
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,153
- How long?!
- About midnight, maybe sooner.

178
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,630
You see, we can play this together.

179
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,598
- Then nobody loses.
- Why midnight?

180
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,754
I got a friend bringing some dough.
As soon as she gets here, we get out.

181
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,878
What if the police find you here?

182
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,473
- What then?
- It wouldn't be pretty.

183
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,714
If that happens,
you folks get it first.

184
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,279
- Kid's turning in.
- Let me explain...

185
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,434
You pull anything, I'll let you
watch me kick the kid's face in!

186
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,471
<i>It's all right, Ralphy.</i>

187
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,310
- What's going on?
- It's all right.

188
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,473
Your old man knows where it's
buttered. How come you're so late?

189
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,428
- I don't have to tell you nothing.
- I've been so worried!

190
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,229
- Scout meeting, remember?
- It don't pay to forget.

191
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,871
What if I could get you the money
you're waiting for before midnight?

192
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,670
You may be a big shot in your office,
but I saw your bank book. 800 bucks!

193
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,718
- You're a punk.
- I could raise more.

194
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,270
- Don't get in an uproar.
- He's using his brain.

195
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,910
- Use yours! Helen's on her way.
- That ain't it.

196
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,232
He's got other business.
What do we care who bust your jaw?

197
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,198
- I'll bust yours...
- Why should we stick our necks...

198
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,353
...just so you can knock a copper off!
- Spill your guts somewhere else.

199
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,513
Who got you here? Who done it?
Get out in the back.

200
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,952
Using his brain, is he? Look at him.
Clickety-click. I can see it perking.

201
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,956
Don't ever try to come in between,
you smart-eyed slob. We're sticking.

202
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,590
Take the kid upstairs
and see he don't get out.

203
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,753
I don't want him hollering
out any windows either.

204
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,388
She's a honey, ain't she, Hal?

205
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,630
Four years!
It don't cost nothing to look.

206
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,792
By the way,
you got a gun in the house?

207
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,270
Stay looking at me
and answer the question.

208
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,908
No, no gun.

209
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,231
That's right, you ain't.
Show him, Hal.

210
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,192
I thought you was going to lie to me.

211
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,830
I like doing business
with a man I can trust.

212
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,992
Get in the kitchen
and cook that chicken.

213
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,790
Do it yourself.
My wife's not your servant.

214
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,235
I always wanted a servant.

215
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,119
- I don't mind.
- I do! Stay here.

216
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,714
You ain't calling the tune!

217
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,509
I got my guts full
of shiny-shoed wise guys

218
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,274
with handkerchiefs in their pockets.

219
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,639
Next time, I'll wipe 'em on you.

220
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,268
Now get out there and cook!

221
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,152
Ralphy, Ralphy!

222
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,472
- Where's my other DC-7?
- I don't know, kid.

223
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,359
- What did you do with it?
- I'll get another.

224
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,592
- You'll let them get away with this?
- I'll take that.

225
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,593
- It's mine!
- Kobish, grow up!

226
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,558
- Sit tight, Pop.
- Hand it over!

227
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,719
- You brat!
- Dad!

228
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,471
It ain't gonna be like this, see?
Not like this!

229
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,359
- Dan! What's happened?
- Get back to the kitchen.

230
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,509
- Get back!
- Go ahead, Ellie. I'm all right.

231
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,719
Hal, put that away.

232
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,474
All the wrong places. This is Bard.
Put Carson on. What a waste of time.

233
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,712
<i>- Bard?
- Nothing here. Anything new there?</i>

234
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,759
<i>- Plenty. We've spotted Griffin's girl.
- Where?</i>

235
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,391
<i>Heading west from Pittsburgh.
Ought to be here at 11.30 or 12.00.</i>

236
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,315
Don't tail her, but I want her
clocked, every town she goes through.

237
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,552
20 miles out, we'll put a real tag on her.

238
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,030
<i>- She'll lead us straight to Griffin.
- Good.</i>

239
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,871
Pretty good chow.

240
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,948
What time is the next news?

241
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,552
They're not so tough.
You hit the big guy.

242
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,871
You could have licked him,
couldn't you?

243
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,511
I lost my temper, that's all.
I can't do that again.

244
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,392
I could climb out my window,
across the roof there, and drop.

245
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,758
It's not much higher than the garage.
I've jumped off the garage.

246
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,472
How many times have I told you
to stay off... the roof of the garage?

247
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,550
But you could.
You could let yourself drop.

248
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,995
I bet you could, Dad.

249
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,630
Listen, Ralph.
You want me to call you Ralph.

250
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,794
You want to be considered a grown
boy. You've got to think like one.

251
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,431
We could get word to the Wallings
or the police. Then what, Ralph?

252
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,391
- The police would know what to do.
- Ralph, those guns down there,

253
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,031
they're loaded. It's not like
in the comic books or televisión.

254
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,191
Those are real bullets.

255
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,868
You're afraid, aren't you?

256
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,311
Yes, son, I'm afraid.

257
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,668
And I'm not ashamed of it.

258
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,638
Sometimes it's better to be afraid.

259
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,997
Well, I'm not! And neither is Cindy!

260
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,948
Hal, upstairs.

261
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,996
Sweetie, you get the pleasure.
If it's for Mr James, I'll take it.

262
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,709
Anybody else, let 'em talk,
except the brat.

263
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,873
Make it sound right,
just like any other night, normal.

264
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,799
Hello?

265
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,871
No, I...

266
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,471
Sore? No, no.

267
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,471
No, please! Not tonight.

268
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,791
No, wait, please!

269
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,551
- I flunked.
- Who was it?

270
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,951
- Sherlock Holmes!
- The boyfriend. He's coming over.

271
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,432
- You ain't as wise as I thought.
- He didn't give her a chance.

272
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,593
Hal, how would you like to take
the little spitfire dancing?

273
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,471
You ought to see him dance. He's got
all the babes groggy. Take a dance!

274
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,871
- What's the matter?
- Cut the clowning.

275
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,110
When Sherlock arrives, you duck out.
Hilliard, I got a job for you.

276
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,273
Go upstairs with Ralphy. Lock the door.
Don't open it until I tell you.

277
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,433
The gas is low in your car.
Fill her up and check the oil.

278
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,592
- Are you crazy?
- The kid and the missus stay.

279
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,753
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Nothing. He's smart.

280
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,549
Clickety-click,
I can hear them wheels going around.

281
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,510
He's saying, "Griffin means business.
He ain't afraid to pull a trigger.

282
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,470
"Is it worth calling the cops,
when I only got a few hours to go?"

283
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,110
If they track you down,
it wouldn't be our doing.

284
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,070
- Maybe, maybe not. I'd never know.
- But you couldn't blame us!

285
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,153
I can do anything.
This is all you got to remember.

286
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,313
Any red lights out front,
or coppers setting up machine guns,

287
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,472
throwing tear gas,
you know who gets it?

288
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,794
Not you. Them. That's all
you gotta keep on your mind.

289
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,519
- Get me some Liquor.
- No liquor.

290
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,468
- He's right.
- You letting this joker give orders?

291
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,952
Nobody gives me orders.
Make it bourbon, bonded.

292
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,590
- Bring some papers.
- Would you like a scrapbook, too?

293
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,399
Wait upstairs until Chuck comes.

294
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,108
When you get back,
park the car heading out.

295
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,748
Nice family you got here.

296
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,598
But you'll see. He'll do something.

297
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,070
Let's go!

298
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,798
- Good evening, sir.
- Fill her up.

299
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,632
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hello, Chuck.

300
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,268
Well, this is more like it.

301
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,314
- On the phone, I thought...
- Chuck, let's go, please.

302
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,229
I'm glad you came.
I was afraid you wouldn't.

303
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,188
- Why?
- You know, after last night...

304
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,991
I'm sorry, Cindy.

305
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,991
About time!

306
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,154
You wouldn't mind taking your hands
out of your pockets, would you?

307
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,311
How about that?

308
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,230
Kinda generous, aren't you?

309
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,393
- Clickety-clickety-click.
- You're off your rocker!

310
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,953
Not that we ain't thankful. You don't
want us to drink ourselves to sleep.

311
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,590
Kobish, check that car.
This guy's getting ideas.

312
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,230
Maybe there's coppers
in the back seat. You check it.

313
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,472
Hal! Look at that car.
I'll cover you.

314
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,631
All right, Pop, in there.

315
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,551
Over there.

316
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,313
Eight years and then you can't open it!

317
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,518
You're all right.

318
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,356
You're working your headpiece
overtime, but you're not a bad guy.

319
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,911
Your woman's waiting.

320
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,437
This guy ain't yellow. I taught him.

321
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,070
- You taught me everything.
- That's right.

322
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,710
Except how to live
in a house like this.

323
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,472
Darling, it's such a short time now,
Less than three hours.

324
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,631
All they'll have is the car.

325
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,271
That's insured. As soon as they've
gone, you'll pick up the phone.

326
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,000
- Sure.
- What are you thinking?

327
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,628
- Nothing, dear.
- What, Dan?

328
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,793
- You're right. It'll soon be over.
- There's something else.

329
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,272
They'll leave, you'll pick up...
They can't let you do that.

330
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,749
- How can he stop it?
- He can't.

331
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,911
He must have a plan.

332
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,391
- I know what you're thinking.
- Don't imagine things, Ellie.

333
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,949
They'll have to take someone.

334
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,630
Dad, don't let them take me.

335
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,270
Ralphy, I just explained
to your mother...

336
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,911
- Please don't let them take me!
- They're not taking you or anyone.

337
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,392
- I won't let them.
- How are you going to stop them?

338
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,199
I'll stop them. I'll find a way.

339
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,239
Get under the covers, darling.
Go back to sleep.

340
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,392
I just had a silly idea, that's all.

341
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,189
Those men
hadn't even thought of that.

342
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,991
Goodnight, Chuck.

343
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,788
You had me so balled up, Cindy.
But I know now.

344
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,589
- What? What do you know?
- It's your father.

345
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,399
I know how he feels about me.

346
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,836
Well, I'm going to
have it out with him.

347
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,151
- No!
- The lights are on. He must be up.

348
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,189
- I said no! It's not that at all.
- Well, what is it, then?

349
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,468
Have fun, sweetie?

350
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,948
What you been doing?

351
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,631
Get upstairs, miss.

352
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,792
- Ain't been searched yet.
- Where's Griffin?

353
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,599
- Stay there!
- We searched the old man.

354
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,788
- Come up, Cindy. Where's Griffin?
- Lift your arms, baby.

355
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,953
- Hold it, Kobish. Hold it, I said!
- What you think...?

356
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,151
- Where'd you get that?
- Go upstairs, miss.

357
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,869
- Where'd you get that gun?
- Hal, you fool!

358
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,831
- Go sleep it off, Kobish.
- Both of you. Both got guns, huh?

359
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,709
Only me. Should have known.

360
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,429
OK, you brothers, you wait.
You just wait!

361
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,071
- Get to bed.
- Just a minute, sis.

362
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,438
You don't get off that easy.
Close the curtains. Gimme that coat.

363
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,835
- Lift your arms.
- Griffin!

364
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,719
Shut up! Come on, get 'em up.

365
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,511
I gotta stop that fool.

366
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,039
Hold it right there.
Don't think I won't.

367
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,791
Kobish!

368
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,311
- Cindy!
- Don't move!

369
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,278
- Glenn!
- Hal, this girl is ill.

370
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,910
- If there's any decency in you...
- Glenn!

371
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,073
Miss, there's no cause to be scared.
Hold it!

372
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,594
Aah! Aah!

373
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,391
Open the door!

374
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,993
Lock the back door.
Turn off the lights. Go up to Ralphy.

375
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,039
Stay away from the windows.
They're all outside.

376
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,439
Operator... Operator...

377
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,230
Operator!

378
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,470
Dan, don't!

379
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,430
<i>Dad!</i>

380
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,398
<i>Operator. Operator.</i>

381
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,391
Is that...?

382
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,395
<i>Your call, please?</i>

383
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,551
They've got Ralphy.

384
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,190
<i>This is the operator.
Your call, please.</i>

385
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,679
Go upstairs. Get in our room,
both of you. Lock the door.

386
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,311
Ellie! If you hear a shot,
make the call.

387
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,431
Ralphy! Where are you?

388
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,591
Here, Dad...

389
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,598
Try something now, the brat gets his.

390
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,834
- Let the boy come in, Griffin.
- Gun first. Set the safety.

391
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,110
Now the lights. Back inside.

392
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,791
I tried anyway.

393
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,188
Go up to your mother, son.

394
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,474
Jumped off the roof.
Brave kid you got there, Hilliard.

395
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,634
Brave family. Going on midnight
and you couldn't wait.

396
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,113
You couldn't wait! You ain't learned
yet who's running this show.

397
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,271
Hands off, Griffin!

398
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,991
<i>Glenn.</i>

399
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,631
Get Kobish in here.

400
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,591
- Bard?
- Yeah.

401
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,753
Helen Miller's not coming.
She ran a red light in Columbus.

402
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,388
- What?
- A patrol car gave chase.

403
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,949
They arrested her
for a traffic violation?!

404
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,318
- She gave them the slip in Columbus.
- But they had orders.

405
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,873
It's been on every teletype between
here and Pittsburgh: Do not arrest!

406
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,353
Oh, those greedy crumbs! Trying to
pick her off on a lousy 15-buck fine.

407
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,832
- Take it easy, Bard.
- Don't tell me to take it easy!

408
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,310
If she's not coming,
she's got to call him.

409
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,471
Dutch, get me a court order.

410
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,634
I want every long-distance call
from Columbus, Ohio, to Indianapolis

411
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,873
as fast as they get 'em,
any number to any number.

412
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,828
<i>- Got you, Chief.
- Names, addresses, numbers.</i>

413
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,992
- Ralphy?
- Don't move, Dan.

414
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,798
- What time...?
- After one.

415
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,351
- Midnight! He said he...
- Dan, listen.

416
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,910
Close your eyes and listen to me,
darling.

417
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,634
You must never do anything
like that again. Ever.

418
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,793
- You might have been killed.
- Why haven't they gone?

419
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,273
Listen! Nobody knows anything
about what's happening here.

420
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,512
We're all alone in this.
Promise me...

421
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,912
Ellie, how long has it been
since I said I love you?

422
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,071
Hal, upstairs.

423
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,151
Lady, get that!

424
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,319
Hello?

425
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,473
<i>I have a collect call for Mr James
from Mrs James.</i>

426
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,438
<i>- Put her on.
- You accept the charges?</i>

427
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,591
Yeah, put her on.

428
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,709
- Get them inside.
- Inside and shut the door.

429
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,028
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah?</i>

430
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,192
<i>- Is this you?
- Yeah. What's up?</i>

431
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,150
<i>I ran into trouble in Columbus.
I'm heading for Louisville.</i>

432
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,313
<i>- You know where.
- Yeah. Now, listen.</i>

433
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,917
Put that stuff in a plain envelope
and take down this address.

434
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,311
<i>- OK?
- Yeah.</i>

435
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,631
As soon as I get it,
we'll make tracks.

436
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,519
<i>- Watch out, see?
- I'll see.</i>

437
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,791
Close them curtains.

438
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,590
- What if they trace that call?
- Ever hear of Circleville, Ohio?

439
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,399
It's 24 miles south of Columbus.

440
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,554
You think them cops will trace calls
from a jerk town like Circleville?

441
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,714
- But what if we get trapped here?
- It can't be nowhere else!

442
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,477
All that dough in this town, I can
have that copper put on ice for good.

443
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,598
Cindy, go to sleep, dear.

444
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,797
You, too.

445
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,314
You don't drink your milk, you ain't
gonna be a big strong man like Daddy.

446
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,039
- How much longer, Griffin?
- Is that any way to talk to a guest?

447
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,478
- How much longer?
- Till I get a certain envelope.

448
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,633
Everything goes on like before.
You and the spitfire go to work.

449
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,112
Junior here misses a day at school.
It won't hurt you, kid.

450
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,590
- I missed a few myself.
- And look at you!

451
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,754
Pass you on the street, you'd look
through us. You're seeing us now!

452
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,912
Hal!

453
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,154
<i>- The morning paper.
- Get your kicks young, kid.</i>

454
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,637
Hal, the paper. You're going to be
late for the office, Hilliard.

455
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,271
Why do you torture my husband?
You take pleasure in torturing people!

456
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,037
I'm attacked from all sides! I take
pleasure in looking out for my skin.

457
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,115
No, it's some sort of game with you.
Cruel! Inhuman!

458
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,590
- Filthy!
- Ellie!

459
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,309
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

460
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,792
The whole family's getting tough!

461
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,190
All right, Pop, get moving.

462
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,199
I'm not leaving this house today!

463
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,991
You stay and we stay. We ain't gonna
beat it until we get that dough.

464
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,436
That dough's in a letter
addressed to your office.

465
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,633
We don't want Federal men
tracing anything to our front door.

466
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,233
He'll go. I'm all right now.

467
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,870
I'll stay with Ralphy.
Cindy, get your coat.

468
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,510
Hey, Ralphy! Shake a leg!

469
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,950
- He's staying home. He hurt his leg.
- He did? The lucky stiff!

470
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,350
He's gonna miss the big game!

471
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,108
A- plus, Pop.

472
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,791
You heard me, Ralph. You're going
to stay with your mother all day.

473
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,270
Don't be hard on the kid.
He saved my neck.

474
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,318
It's all right. We'll be all right.

475
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,791
I don't see nothing so funny
you should break your neck laughing.

476
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,432
I laugh when I feel like it.
You ain't got nothing to say about it.

477
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,070
- That right, Hal?
- Yeah, that's right.

478
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,550
Get the dough and come back.
No mistakes.

479
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,713
That nick on your head.
Got a story ready?

480
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,873
It wouldn't take much of a slip,
just a little one,

481
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,830
and you're gonna wish you'd never
come back through this door.

482
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,108
I never understood before
how your mind works, but I do now.

483
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,274
- You'll be late for that time clock.
- I've got the same thing in me.

484
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,750
- I want to kill you.
- You're a comedian!

485
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,710
If anything goes wrong,
any harm comes to any one of us,

486
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,351
I'll do it, I'll kill you,
so help me God!

487
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,559
- You understand that?
- Yeah, I got you.

488
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,712
We understand each other all the way.

489
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,632
Lady, you didn't know what
a tough old bird you married!

490
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,312
No. No, I didn't.

491
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,190
Dad, are we making a mistake
not going to the police?

492
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,673
Maybe. I don't know.
I've tried to think of everything.

493
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,308
But you heard him, Cindy.

494
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,473
I won't gamble with
your mother's life, or Ralphy's.

495
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,631
Oh, Dad!

496
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,791
Cindy, baby.

497
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,272
Listen, nobody can know anything
about this. Not Chuck. Nobody.

498
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,911
And another thing,
you're not going back tonight.

499
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,551
Go to your girlfriend's or a hotel,
but don't come home.

500
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,311
Hal!

501
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,473
Get the old lady down here!

502
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,310
- Who is it?
- Mr Patterson. He takes the trash.

503
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,951
- Let him pick it up and beat it.
- This is the end of the month.

504
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,272
- He'll come to the door to collect.
- OK, pay him!

505
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,596
Hal, get back upstairs
with the brat. I said pay him!

506
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,119
Yes, just a second!

507
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,071
Here, let me see that.

508
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,549
Use your head.
Hal's upstairs with the brat.

509
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,075
Yes!

510
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,474
Good morning, Mrs Hilliard.
Thank you, ma'am. Is there any...?

511
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,519
Aren't you feeling yourself today,
Mrs Hilliard?

512
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,674
- Just a headache, Mr Patterson.
- I'll take these papers with me.

513
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,832
- All right.
- Goodbye, Mrs Hilliard.

514
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,991
What's up?

515
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,630
- Want me to grab him, Griffin? Huh?
- He's going away.

516
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,234
Shut up, both of you.

517
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:57,792
Give me the gun. I'll stop him.
Griffin, ain't you gonna do nothing?

518
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,631
- Do you want to let him get away?
- She paid him with a cheque.

519
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,429
Get it back. If you get in trouble,
don't come back.

520
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,311
Get back upstairs.

521
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,711
Keep going, George.

522
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,191
<i>- Keep your eyes on the road.
- Watch where you're going!</i>

523
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,629
Drive out of town.
I'd like to see some country.

524
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:09,352
- Good morning, Mr Hilliard.
- Good morning. Good morning.

525
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,590
- Good morning, Miss Wells.
- Good morning, Mr Hilliard.

526
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,115
I'll open it today.

527
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,988
- Not interrupting anything?
- I'm busy as the devil!

528
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,470
OK, Mr Executive!
What happened to your head?

529
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,189
- Well...
- Tell me when you're not so busy!

530
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,310
- When's the next mail?
- This afternoon.

531
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,950
- There's one more delivery.
- Bring it in when it arrives.

532
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,111
- Yes, sir.
- Unopened.

533
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,151
<i>Read all about it!</i>

534
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,192
Boy, take this to the police station
around the corner.

535
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,911
- Are you a guest at the hotel?
- Yes. And no questions.

536
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,958
Yes, sir. No questions at all, sir.

537
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,234
<i>Extra! Read all about it!</i>

538
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,991
Ah, missed.

539
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,519
Turn here!

540
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,710
You ain't gonna be needing it.

541
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,793
Mister, I ain't gonna open my mouth.
Honest.

542
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,793
I ain't gonna say a word to nobody.

543
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,110
I know you ain't, George.

544
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,631
- I have to talk to you.
- Some other time.

545
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,032
I'm sorry, Mr Hilliard.
I just had lunch with Cindy.

546
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,156
Yeah...?

547
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,118
- What's happening?
- It's nothing.

548
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,909
Nothing? She's miserable.
If I'm the cause...

549
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,709
- It doesn't concern you.
- It concerns me!

550
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,873
- Stay out of it!
- What kind of a father are you?

551
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,029
<i>- Yes?
- A Mr James is calling, Mr Hilliard.</i>

552
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,471
Put him on.

553
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,679
- Yeah?
- Hilliard, you recognise my voice?

554
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,630
<i>- What do you want? What's happened?
- Come and get me.</i>

555
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,032
- Where are you?
- Fall Creek Road. The golf course.

556
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,873
You won't see me, but I'll be waiting.

557
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:16,553
- It'll be a long wait, Mr James.
- I get nabbed and I'll spill my guts.

558
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,791
Wait a minute.

559
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,509
- This is a private conversation.
- I'm sorry.

560
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,071
<i>- Yeah?
- You there?</i>

561
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,596
I'll call the coppers,
tip 'em the address.

562
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,230
<i>- Let 'em shoot up the joint.
- Stay out of sight.</i>

563
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,198
It'll take me an hour to get there.

564
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,200
That's the last delivery today.

565
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:12,671
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

566
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,400
You can mind your own business.

567
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,629
- Mr Hilliard...
- I'm sorry, Chuck. Not now.

568
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,631
It's a. 38.

569
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,630
That guard at Terre Haute,
his gun was a. 38.

570
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,793
Bard, you can't tie in every crime
in the state with Griffin.

571
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,954
Why would anybody pump three slugs
into an old man? He wasn't robbed.

572
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,918
Nothing much. Here's his address.

573
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,709
- Find out where he worked today.
- I'm bushed!

574
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,874
One of his customers was probably
the last person that saw him alive.

575
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,950
- My singing bother you?
- Tell me what you were doing there.

576
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,998
Maybe I was playing a game of golf.

577
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,313
Give you a little hint, Hilliard.
Just like on them quiz shows.

578
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,948
Three bullets left.

579
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,471
Tell Ralphy we beat
the socks off them!

580
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,953
- Beat it. Get away! All of you!
- Hey, what did I say wrong?

581
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,111
What did I say?

582
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,158
Well, Cindy,
when she was Ralphy's age...

583
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,719
- Ellie!
- Dan...

584
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,270
You remember Miss Swift,
Ralphy's teacher?

585
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,432
Sure I do. How are you, Miss Swift?

586
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,950
I want you to meet...
Johnny, come here!

587
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,159
I met Johnny in a bar.
We had a couple. He's an old friend.

588
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,915
I promised him another.
Will you excuse me?

589
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,548
- There you are!
- She's seen me.

590
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,599
<i>I'll get her out of here.
Make yourself at home!</i>

591
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,231
<i>- Ralphy will be all right tomorrow.
- Pour yourself a real one!</i>

592
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,790
<i>- I'll be right back!
- Thank you, Ralph.</i>

593
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,991
I'd better be going.

594
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,948
Miss Swift dropped by
to see how Ralphy was feeling.

595
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,271
Miss Swift,
that's a nice PTA practice.

596
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,910
- I'll be sure you get full credit.
- For what?

597
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,232
- His week's composition.
- Excuse me, do you mind?

598
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,994
Miss Swift, do you encourage
such drivel as this?

599
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,879
You're in no condition to discuss it.

600
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,033
In that case, I'll read it
in the morning. Have a drink!

601
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,988
- Come on, make it a party!
- I'm very sorry.

602
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,151
- Nice work.
- We gotta stop that dame!

603
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,711
- She didn't recognise you!
- Hilliard took her mind off you.

604
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:39,034
Had her in a sweat. I gotta hand it
to you, you'd make a great con man.

605
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,670
- What about the old guy?
- He ain't picking up trash.

606
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,319
- Tailed?
- No.

607
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,950
Mr Patterson
saw their car in the garage.

608
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:59,474
Listen to this! "Dear Miss Swift,
bring help right away.

609
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,633
"There are men in the house
with guns. They are criminals. "

610
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,791
Kid's a good speller, Pop.

611
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,479
Crying department's upstairs, lady.

612
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,270
Griffin, it came. Afternoon mail.

613
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,230
Yeah? How could it?
It wasn't mailed till this morning.

614
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,914
- Take it easy.
- You...

615
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,319
It ain't enough. Thanks, anyway.

616
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,392
That's enough for us. Let's blow.

617
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,711
- Tomorrow.
- Why go on taking chances?

618
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,873
If you don't take chances,
you might as well be dead.

619
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,750
That's what you're gonna be,
all of us, if this goes on. Dead!

620
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,268
I'll take the. 38 now, Kobish.

621
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,560
I like the feel of it, Griffin.

622
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,517
Clickety-click, don't work it overtime!

623
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,913
Griffin, when you leave here,
if that time ever comes...

624
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:13,073
- Watch your manners.
- You know I'm gonna call the police.

625
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,394
- You wouldn't do a thing like that.
- What'll you do about it?

626
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,030
- Rip it out.
- There's one next door.

627
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:27,711
- What's on your mind?
- I know what you're planning.

628
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,079
- You're not taking anyone along.
- Say, that's not a bad idea.

629
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,233
- I never thought of that.
- You thought of it, all the way.

630
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,949
You give us a fair shake,
we'll give you a fair shake.

631
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,750
As soon as the dough gets here,
we'll take you with us. Just you.

632
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,435
- We ain't followed, you walk home.
- That's a deal.

633
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,596
Sure, Pop. A deal's a deal.
In the meantime, don't get ulcers.

634
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:12,476
I know what's eating you, kid.
We'll take the girl along just for you.

635
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,631
Is that a fair shake?

636
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,873
Did guys like Hilliard
ever give you a fair shake?

637
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,790
- I'll take the automatic now.
- Get Kobish's.

638
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,190
I'm hanging on to this one.

639
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,110
<i>- Two burgers, no onions.
- Two burgers, no onions!</i>

640
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,273
The main roads are covered.
It'll be dark in half an hour.

641
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,434
I want this area combed. Every one
of the trashman's customers.

642
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,873
- There ain't gonna be no shooting?
- No. Just get us coffee later.

643
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:11,189
Report anything unusual,
especially the garages.

644
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,750
- That's police talk!
- This just came in.

645
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,228
A bellhop's given six descriptions
of the man he delivered it for.

646
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,949
We know only
that the man was wearing clothes.

647
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:28,433
"Innocent people will be in the house
or automobile with the fugitives you want.

648
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,593
"If you shoot, you'll be responsible
for the lives of innocent people.

649
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,230
"To trace this letter
will endanger those people. "

650
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,598
- No signature.
- Now we know.

651
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,752
- It's a blind.
- That letter's no blind.

652
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,310
The idiot.
You can't play ball with savages.

653
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,472
- Let's get moving.
- What you gonna do?

654
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,428
Follow your instructions,
knock on a few doors.

655
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,798
- I'm countermanding those orders.
- You can't put off a showdown!

656
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,750
Nobody wants one more than me,
but we can't get a family massacred.

657
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,914
Listen, you young punk, pity is
a luxury your badge doesn't afford!

658
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:14,074
Is it any wonder the guy doesn't sign
his name or trust the police to help?

659
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:19,030
- What do you propose, Jesse?
- Get the prowl cars off the streets.

660
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,668
Tom and me will cruise around.

661
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,991
They'll slip out.
There's plenty of alleys.

662
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,311
- Block 'em all!
- It's too big an area!

663
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,075
If they slip through,
your name is mud! Yours too!

664
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,951
Get some equipment moved in here.
Take my car. It's not marked.

665
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,395
Get riot guns and tear gas.

666
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,630
- Wait a minute, Cindy.
- Please, Chuck!

667
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,959
Stay away from here.
I don't want to see you any more.

668
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:16,154
- Cindy, didn't I tell you...?
- I couldn't help it, Dad.

669
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,313
Clickety-clickety-click.
You only got one trouble.

670
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,472
You don't know when you're licked.

671
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,428
Hal! The spitfire
had to come back to you.

672
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,871
You didn't blab to the boyfriend,
did you?

673
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,033
- Chuck knows nothing.
- Then, why's he still sitting there?

674
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,191
Back on that window.

675
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,828
If you pulled a fast one...

676
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,749
Chuck doesn't know anything.

677
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,590
- Kobish!
- Hey, Glenn! Here he comes again.

678
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,519
Kobish!

679
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,835
This can't go on. First the old man,
then the teacher, now this guy.

680
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,993
Somebody's gonna get wise.
I'm not sticking any longer.

681
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,473
- Kobish, watch 'em!
- All right, beat it.

682
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,314
- I'm getting out.
- Don't lose your head.

683
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,792
I'm not going to the chair
'cause that ape got trigger-happy!

684
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,431
- The dough will come in the morning.
- What good is it in the death house?

685
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,913
That gal's got you all messed up.
If you want something, take it!

686
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,278
- He knows it's not that simple.
- You stay out of this!

687
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,120
- Hal gets what he wants.
- I doubt it. I doubt if I ever will.

688
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,998
- You'll be back in stir in under an hour!
- I can take care of myself!

689
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,628
- Since when?
- Since right now!

690
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,271
- I don't advise your leaving now.
- They won't catch me.

691
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:32,228
- Come along, Glenn.
- You ain't gonna take no car.

692
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,871
- I'll take the girl's coupé
- They'll trace it in ten minutes.

693
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:42,353
Yeah... OK, Mr Hilliard.
I can pick up a car anywhere.

694
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,832
- You're gonna listen to me...
- You're not stopping me!

695
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,710
Who's stopping you?
You got more guts than I thought, kid.

696
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,268
Here, take this.

697
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,312
- I got more coming.
- Thanks, Glenn.

698
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,998
Take care of yourself. No chances.

699
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,472
You get in any trouble,
you know where I'll be.

700
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,632
- Be careful, Hal.
- OK, Glenn.

701
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,791
I mean it, see?

702
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,468
What are you gaping at?!

703
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,233
- You better get hold of yourself.
- I got hold.

704
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:19,233
- You got yours coming! All of you!
- Why'd you let him go?

705
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:24,030
Good riddance.
He was getting on my nerves.

706
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,430
- Satisfied?
- Listen...

707
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,592
Shut up, Mr Hilliard!
"Mr", he called you!

708
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,390
- You can't turn this on us.
- I got my guts full of you!

709
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:40,874
Smart-eyed, respectable suckers!
We seen 'em sitting on parole boards!

710
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,273
"Throw him in the cell! He ain't fit
to live with decent folk!" Decent?!

711
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,508
<i>We bring you a bulletin
from the WTLI newsroom.</i>

712
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:00,152
<i>We have an unconfirmed report
that the combined police agencies</i>

713
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,471
<i>are searching for

714
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,110
<i>just north of the city limits

715
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,755
Glenn! I gotta phone.

716
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,950
- What are you gonna do?
- Shut up.

717
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,111
Stop the car.

718
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,748
- I got a wife and kids!
- Stop the car!

719
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,755
All right. Now get out. Get out!

720
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,790
Two cups of java
and some change, please.

721
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,436
Oh, excuse me.

722
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,032
Hey, Nick!

723
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,437
Glenn!

724
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,151
Take it, Hilliard.

725
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,877
Hello? Yes.

726
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:44,398
This is Carl at the store. That
special-delivery letter just came.

727
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,712
<i>- There's nobody to bring it to you.
- Tell him you'll pick it up.</i>

728
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,519
I'll be down right away. Thanks.

729
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,791
<i>OK, snap it up.</i>

730
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,791
Go to Ralphy.

731
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,873
The money's here.
I told the night watchman to call me.

732
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,679
I'll be back right away.

733
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,833
Ellie, when they leave,
I'll have to go along.

734
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,470
Only me, just to make sure
they get out of town.

735
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,950
- No, I won't let you go!
- Listen!

736
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:24,113
Wait four hours. If you don't hear
from me, call the police.

737
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,999
<i>- Dan...
- Snap it up up there!</i>

738
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,628
Ellie, it's the only way!

739
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,793
<i>- He hates you. He'll kill you.
- That dough's waiting!</i>

740
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,430
We're not saved
if anything happens to you!

741
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,593
That's the way it is, that's all.
You do as I say.

742
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,151
<i>Hilliard, come on!</i>

743
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,630
- Go in to your mother.
- Dad, come here.

744
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,438
Go ahead.

745
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,393
- What is it?
- When they take you, I'm going too.

746
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,468
You'll do nothing of the sort.

747
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:21,316
You'll do what I tell you. I've had
all I'm going to take, young man!

748
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,119
<i>Hurry up!</i>

749
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,108
- Grab a taxi. Don't bring it back.
- Remember our deal!

750
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,158
- On your way!
- I'll be 45 minutes.

751
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,118
- Step on it.
- Get going.

752
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:06,356
<i>- Go ahead.
- Two soups, take 'em away!</i>

753
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,949
What is this?

754
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,510
- What's your business?
- Attorney. What is this?

755
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,673
I'm in a hurry. What are you doing
cruising round here?

756
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,991
- Is it against the law?
- Don't get fresh.

757
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,470
You got no warrant, no charges.
I don't bully.

758
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,950
- You fronting for those rats?
- What rats?

759
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,590
Don't you read the papers?
They're up here, see?

760
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,072
Holed up in one of those houses.
What's up?

761
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,598
- Nothing.
- You suspect something.

762
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,991
- No.
- You look like I just kicked you.

763
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,472
It's just a shock, that's all.
My girl lives round here.

764
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,235
Where? Where? Name, address!

765
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,510
I don't know what I'd do in your
shoes, but I'm gonna get that name.

766
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,831
- Now spit it out!
- You can't hold me.

767
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,630
I can if you don't co-operate. Aiding
and abetting, accessory to murder!

768
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,792
- Carson speaking.
- They killed a man.

769
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:15,431
That's the scum you let your girl
spend the evening with. Talk... fast!

770
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,795
- Make me.
- I can.

771
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,032
Hold it, will you? Yeah, spell it.

772
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:27,031
H- I-L-L-I-A-R-D.

773
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,715
D as in David. Hilliard. Got it.

774
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,873
- What happened?
- State police killed Hal Griffin.

775
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:40,034
He was carrying a gun registered
in the name of Daniel C Hilliard.

776
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,919
Daniel C... Hilliard.

777
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,959
We got it! One son, aged nine.

778
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,430
- Daughter, 19, Cynthia.
- I don't know her.

779
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:56,391
Then, you got nothing to worry about.
Alert everybody. We're moving in.

780
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:01,759
Throw a cordon round this house.
Let no one in or out of the block.

781
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,514
If I get inside with a gun...

782
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,389
Don't get any ideas.
We can't let anything go haywire.

783
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,552
- What can I do?
- Say a prayer.

784
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,518
But nothing else, you hear? Nothing!

785
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,478
<i>Poached two and an order of bacon!</i>

786
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,151
- What's going on?
- Phone?

787
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,117
Round the corner.

788
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,351
Hey, up there! Kobish, upstairs.
You take it, sis.

789
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,639
Hello?

790
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,991
I'm fine, Chuck.

791
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:15,598
Cindy, I've been thinking...
Can you hear me? I'm in a garage.

792
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,917
<i>I've got to talk to your father.</i>

793
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,629
He doesn't like me,
but Let's get it straightened out.

794
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,791
No! Not tonight, Chuck.

795
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:31,677
Mother and Dad have company.
They're playing cards.

796
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:36,755
I don't care. I'm coming over.
You're not playing cards, are you?

797
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,433
No, I...

798
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,071
Come out when I honk the horn.
If you don't, I'll come in.

799
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,871
What's he up to? What does he know?
You ain't going nowhere.

800
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,669
- You heard him.
- We don't want nobody else here.

801
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,831
Shut up a minute!

802
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,950
We've still got two of them.
All we need to get away, ain't it?

803
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,271
- Cindy, you go.
- What do you mean?

804
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,910
Your old lady's
gonna be with us in the car.

805
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:30,870
Any cops outside, any guns go off,
you'll find her in a ditch.

806
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,031
The brat, too.

807
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,993
- Here you are, Mr Hilliard.
- Thanks, Carl, thanks!

808
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,670
Is that him?
How come he got here so quick?

809
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,240
- Go on!
- No, I'm staying here.

810
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,393
- You're doing nothing of the sort.
- No!

811
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,870
- Did you hear me?!
- No, Mother!

812
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,190
He's getting out of the car.

813
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,198
- Cindy, please!
- No, Mother! I'm not leaving you!

814
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:11,352
Hello, Cindy... Mrs Hilliard.

815
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,313
- I can't go out.
- Yes, she can.

816
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,677
Stop kidding me!
Goodnight, Mrs Hilliard.

817
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:29,870
- You're out. Thank God you're safe.
- What do you mean?

818
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,753
- Chuck, what...?
- They're all around the block.

819
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,918
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

820
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,878
I'm going home. What's it to you?

821
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,238
We're police officers.
What's your name?

822
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,190
- Walling. Claude Walling.
- Address?

823
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:11,951
- For God's sake, what's happening?
- Are you Daniel Hilliard?

824
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:16,910
- I've got to get home.
- Come along with us. Let's be quiet.

825
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:21,232
They're still in there, sir.
This way, please.

826
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,632
Mr Hilliard, come on upstairs.

827
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,789
- Dan, we didn't know...
- Claude.

828
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,235
- Dad!
- Your mother?

829
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,391
- Ralphy?
- Mr Hilliard.

830
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,394
- Mr Hilliard, is Ralph OK?
- Yeah.

831
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,869
OK, Harris, stand by.

832
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,033
How come you let so much time
get away and did nothing?

833
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,760
Gentlemen, this is Mr Hilliard.

834
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,232
- He was walking back to his house.
- How did I slip up?

835
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,188
You didn't. Young Griffin's dead.
He had your gun.

836
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,352
I'm Masters, sheriff of this county.

837
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,990
I'm taking over.
Did you write this letter?

838
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,630
You know the whole thing.
You can't use these.

839
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,315
You're not telling us
how to do our job?

840
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,470
If you'd come to us,
you wouldn't be in this fix.

841
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:20,111
- I'd have been in it sooner.
- Nobody's blaming you.

842
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,078
Are they in the house? How many guns?

843
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:27,028
- One... with three bullets.
- Well, that helps.

844
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,637
- Also my wife and son.
- No one wants innocent people hurt.

845
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,951
Then take your men,
your gun and lights away!

846
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,111
There's been a murder.

847
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,159
- The papers are starting to scream.
- What do I care?

848
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:46,314
What if they bluff their way out?
You don't want them to kill others.

849
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,359
I don't want them or you
to kill my wife or boy!

850
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,990
- With me, that's first!
- What do you suggest?

851
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,631
I've got several thousand dollars.
Without that, they're not coming out.

852
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,588
- Then we move in.
- Am I supposed to watch it happen?

853
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,753
- It's suicide to go back.
- That fact doesn't enter in!

854
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,990
Let him take the dough in.

855
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:13,472
What does it matter if you get Griffin now
or when he comes out?

856
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:18,430
- You'll win your election.
- You're out of it. Don't go back.

857
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,592
The minute you're ready, we move in.

858
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,554
Gentlemen, since this is
a Federal case, it's my decisión.

859
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:45,192
- Do you want a gun, Mr Hilliard?
- Thanks.

860
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,669
- They search you?
- Yeah.

861
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,630
I want a statement
exonerating my office.

862
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,588
- You'll get it.
- I'll take the gun.

863
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,391
- An empty gun?
- You crazy?

864
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:24,556
- Maybe, but Griffin doesn't think so.
- That's a pretty long shot.

865
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,508
I don't have any short ones in sight.
They're waiting.

866
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:33,470
I'll give you ten minutes from
the time you go through that door.

867
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,790
We're playing it your way.

868
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,791
Good luck, sir.

869
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,151
That gentleman's had it.

870
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,312
Man plays with dynamite,
he's gonna get it.

871
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,472
- See that he gets through.
- OK.

872
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,668
- You got the dough?
- Dan?

873
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,070
- Stay with Ralphy!
- No!

874
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,959
Before I'll let you go, I'll scream!

875
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:21,830
Open your mouth, the old man gets
a slug in the stomach. The dough!

876
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,992
I'll give it to you in the car.

877
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,869
You'll give it right now.
Get your hands up.

878
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,631
Get 'em up!

879
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,792
- I'll take that.
- You'll take what?

880
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,108
You had it all doped out.

881
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,590
- You crossing-crossing...
- Use your fat head!

882
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:58,389
Without me, you're cooked.
Put this in your pocket.

883
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,030
- Forget your big ideas.
- OK, let's roll.

884
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:05,795
Clickety-click,
you keep trying to the end.

885
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:11,591
Ellie, go back in that room!
I'm ready, Griffin.

886
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,151
- This gun wasn't part of our deal.
- Dan, I meant what I said!

887
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,154
- Get in that room!
- Bring the kid on a picnic.

888
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,834
- Lock the door!
- Knock it off.

889
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,391
Didn't I invite the family
to a picnic?

890
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:33,553
- I can kick down that door.
- I said I was ready.

891
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,714
I heard you. But I'd feel better in
a car with lots of people around me.

892
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,871
Cover this wise guy.

893
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,471
Did you hear that?

894
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,560
You don't want to miss the fun.

895
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,188
Sounded like...

896
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:06,229
<i>We're gonna be late and
all the ice cream's gonna be ate up!</i>

897
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:10,837
- What's going on?
- I thought I heard something.

898
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,993
<i>You want me to kick the door down?
Lady, you ain't smart.</i>

899
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,958
- Did you bring coppers here?
- No!

900
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,588
You're lying in your teeth!

901
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,799
Crazy!

902
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,870
- I don't see nothing.
- They might be hiding.

903
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:48,511
<i>- Could be the police.
- Do as I say and Junior grows up.</i>

904
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:52,229
You there! Coppers!
We still got the Hilliards!

905
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,716
<i>Dan!</i>

906
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,119
Dan!

907
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,310
- Ralphy!
- Dad!

908
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,869
- Ralphy!
- Dad! Dad!

909
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,838
- He's got Ralphy!
- Go out the back door!

910
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,389
Get over to the Wallings!

911
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,030
Do as I say!
Ralphy's going to be all right.

912
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,589
<i>- Dad, hurry!
- Go ahead!</i>

913
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:44,431
- Dad!
- You're gonna get me out of this.

914
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,229
- Let go of the boy.
- Fat chance with those cops.

915
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,870
If you want my help,
take your hands off him.

916
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,399
OK.

917
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,109
You move, kid,
I'll blow your head off.

918
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,913
Ralph, I want you to do
exactly what I tell you.

919
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,073
- This man is not going to hurt you.
- You'll find out!

920
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,629
Will you do exactly as I say?

921
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,793
You don't know me
if you think I'm bluffing!

922
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,155
- Run!
- Feel that?

923
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,913
Run!

924
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,799
Go out the back door!

925
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:52,597
<i>- The boy's coming out!
- Yes, we see him.</i>

926
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:57,231
- Mr Hilliard, are you all right?
- Yes, stay where you are.

927
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:09,636
- You ain't got it in you, Pop.
- I got it in me. You put it there!

928
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:16,272
- What are you waiting for?
- It's not that easy for you.

929
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,512
I want to tell you
about your brother.

930
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:23,309
He's dead, full of police bullets.

931
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,471
And you did it!

932
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:30,710
How does it feel? How do you like it?

933
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,310
Go ahead, get it over with.

934
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,798
You can't do it, can you, Pop?

935
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:07,111
Get out. Get out of my house.

936
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,791
<i>We're waiting for Griffin,
Mr Hilliard.</i>

937
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,198
- Look, Pop...
- Get out!

938
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,709
Let me have this.

939
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,075
Griffin, this is Bard.

940
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,231
<i>Come on out.</i>

941
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,474
Griffin, we're waiting for you!

942
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,591
Come ahead, Griffin.

943
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,594
Mr Hilliard, keep away
from the front of the house.

944
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:07,793
Raise your hands above your head
and walk into the light.

945
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,719
<i>Raise your hands above your head!</i>

946
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,191
- Dad?
- Yes, Ralph?

947
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,031
Congratulations, Mr Hilliard.
Fine work.
