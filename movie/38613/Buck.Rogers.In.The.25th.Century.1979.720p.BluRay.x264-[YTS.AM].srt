1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,209
About 25 seconds.
Authorization for the launch.

2
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,625
- All ready. Twenty.
- Ten, nine, eight...

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,917
- seven, six, five...
- Internal management.

4
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:21,417
Four, three, two, one, zero.

5
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,209
In 1987, at the John F.
Kennedy Space Center...

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,292
NASA launched the latest US
interplanetary space probe.

7
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,584
In the payload of the warhead
of the huge rocket...

8
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:41,084
I was going a man's exploration ship.
The Ranger 3.

9
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:44,334
On board the compact
interstellar ship...

10
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,459
Captain William "Buck" Rogers...

11
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:50,667
He experienced cosmic forces
that were incomprehensible.

12
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,875
He saw death closely.

13
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,959
In the blink of an eye,
unimaginable temperatures froze...

14
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,542
Your life maintenance team.

15
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,500
Ranger 3 went out of its way...

16
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,250
and it entered into a thousand
times more extensive orbit...

17
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,459
same that returned the ship
to the starting point...

18
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:12,834
to Mother Earth...

19
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:17,209
not five months later,
but 500 years later.

20
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,834
For 500 years, Buck Rogers was
adrift in a world where...

21
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:27,000
reality and fantasy merged
into an eternal dream.

22
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,334
Alert!! Alert!
A hostile ship approaches.

23
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,417
Clear the platforms to attack.

24
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,959
Wait!

25
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:09,917
There's something weird about that ship.
I had never seen one like that.

26
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,000
Prepare to tow it.

27
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,125
Embrace the alien ship
in a force field...

28
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,292
and prepare her to get
on board the Draconia.

29
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,042
- Transport of neurosystems.
- In transport.

30
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,250
Begin heart-lung procedure.

31
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,084
- Dilute a minor pressure agent.
- Transmitting.

32
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,959
Increase diogen and
crystalline in proportion.

33
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:02,167
The heart-lung response increased
0.2 and continues to rise.

34
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,334
We begin to receive positive
neurological signals.

35
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,709
Its alive.

36
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,834
Ahead.

37
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:21,834
What's so important about the
intruder that you could not wait?

38
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:25,009
The man is alive.
I'm not sure why.

39
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,542
Not sure why?
Do I have to decipher the riddle?

40
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,667
I must decipher it.

41
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,584
The ship is outdated like none
I've seen in the star system...

42
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,292
or outside the history books.

43
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,800
Kane, please.

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,584
They froze it with a
combination of gases.

45
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,250
Oxygen, cryogen, ozone, metal.

46
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,375
Balanced almost perfectly.

47
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,209
They are techniques used in the
galaxy for terminal diseases.

48
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,125
Yes, at present.

49
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,250
However, there is another issue.
The ship of man.

50
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,050
Kane, you have one more minute.

51
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,625
His instruments stopped...

52
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,000
frozen in the year 1987.

53
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:06,042
- Are you telling me...
- The man could be 500 years old.

54
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,834
- Are you serious.
- Yes.

55
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,084
Frozen by elements so
instantaneously and perfectly...

56
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:17,250
which is totally preserved and alive.

57
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,500
It is a fascinating idea.

58
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:29,459
- Preserved young or old?
- Very young.

59
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,709
Are you flawed by the hard experience?

60
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:38,834
Fortunately for him, we are
very advanced in cryogenics.

61
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,792
I have not met a man of 500 years.
Prepare it for a hearing.

62
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,875
I think it's possible
that he is not coherent.

63
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,667
I will be lenient.

64
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,292
- Where I am?
- We ask the questions.

65
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,092
Who are you?

66
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,667
Captain Buck Rogers, Air
Force of the United States.

67
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,337
- Who are you?
- What did he say?

68
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:12,125
Something about a united states.

69
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,875
Captain, where are you going?

70
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,834
- What's going on?
- My head.

71
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,667
- Does anyone have an aspirin?
- What does that mean?

72
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,542
It must be some kind of
drug to remove the pain.

73
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,292
Give him something for his annoyance.

74
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:36,875
What place is this?

75
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,167
Where I am?

76
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,175
Who are you?

77
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,042
It's in the Draconia,
the king's flagship...

78
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,292
under the command of the
royal princess Ardala.

79
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,759
- Who?
- Where are you from.?

80
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,625
Wait, wait, wait. Slower.

81
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,542
What did he say about a ship?

82
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,375
It is a fortress of the king on the
way to Earth on a mission of peace.

83
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,584
On the way to Earth?

84
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:13,792
Do you mean to say that you are not...
of the...

85
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,167
Do you mean we're not...

86
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,250
Are not we on Earth?

87
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,167
I will definitely need the aspirin.

88
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,584
- Give it to her.
- Just a moment.

89
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:27,959
Captain.

90
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,717
Keep in mind that he is a prisoner...

91
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,792
of a dynasty that conquered
75% of the universe.

92
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,959
He will respond with care
if he values his life.

93
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,334
You. Is she a princess of real life?

94
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,167
I think we gave our captain
too much medicine.

95
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,709
No, no, I feel great.

96
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,584
The United States of America...

97
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,125
It was an empire of the planet
Earth a few centuries ago.

98
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,717
You took juice from those royal tutors.

99
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,500
You are from Earth, Kane.
You should know more than me.

100
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,667
The United States perished
almost 500 years ago.

101
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,342
That would explain his ship,
his clothes, the instruments.

102
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:26,250
I have a better explanation.
I think he's an infiltrator...

103
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,375
of the Federal Terrestrial Council.

104
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,125
- An infiltrator?
- Yes.

105
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:33,375
An Army spy put in our way.

106
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:37,125
They would not dare. I am a real
sent from my father's kingdom.

107
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,625
I am aware of his
father's purpose.

108
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,500
Guarantee trade between the
Earth and the draconians.

109
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,584
What reason would they have
to put a spy on board?

110
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,500
Check our ship.

111
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:50,634
- See if we are armed.
- I see.

112
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:54,759
- We could not allow that, could we?
- Do not.

113
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,542
Then, I suppose I can dispose
of Captain Rogers as he wishes.

114
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:04,000
How you take care of security
is your prerogative.

115
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,709
Follow me, Tiger Man.

116
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,500
Go design Heavens!

117
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,250
- How is he this morning?
- Fabulous.

118
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,584
What a coincidence.
I have a ship like this.

119
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,009
Disconnect the medication.

120
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,709
Oh, do not do that.
I really love it. But...

121
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,125
- Very soon he will leave.
- Great. Where we go?

122
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,167
- He'll go home.
- Great. Where is that?

123
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,542
- On earth.
- Oh, sure.

124
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,792
We repair and reprogram
your ship to take it home.

125
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,834
- Sure, he's anxious.
- Oh, yes.

126
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,500
It seems I've been absent for weeks.

127
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:56,917
Oh. Oh.

128
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,042
I should have had a lot of fun with you.

129
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:03,750
You know? I will miss you.
I have a great idea.

130
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,375
- How about we all go down together?
- Come on. We will reach it.

131
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,667
Not if I wake up.

132
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:17,250
Goodbye. Oh, what an incredible dream.

133
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:28,375
In Houston you will be surprised
when you return with this story.

134
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:29,917
Battery.

135
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,917
Prepare to launch
the alien ship.

136
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,750
Five seconds for the launch.
Four...

137
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,875
three two...

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,417
one. Launching.

139
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,667
It gave us the opportunity to test
the protective shield of the Earth.

140
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:04,042
How to prove it?
We know that anyone who enters...

141
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,375
without authorization they
incinerate it immediately.

142
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,959
But if our captain is a
spy, as I believe...

143
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,875
they will escort him through the shield...

144
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,542
along the channel that
only the military knows.

145
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,092
How can that help us?

146
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:20,834
I hid a microtransmitter
in Captain Rogers' ship...

147
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,125
who will send us a guided map.

148
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,459
When we give the signal...

149
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,500
your father's attack
forces will use the map...

150
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,417
to pierce his protective shield.

151
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,709
What if Captain Rogers is not a spy?

152
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,917
Then, it will burn.

153
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,250
I see.

154
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,109
It does not seem very pleased.

155
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,084
Of course I'm pleased.

156
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:47,875
But I have a strange feeling that
I will see Captain Rogers again.

157
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,917
Air control 1 to ship Able, Baker 4.

158
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,750
- Here location control.
- Approaching.

159
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,584
- What is your position and fuel?
- Confirmed.

160
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,625
Here Tartalia to air control Long.
We are approximately...

161
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:19,167
Houston control, here the 711 flight.
Answer, control of Houston.

162
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,584
Leave the cards and the backgammon.
Buck the lucky one came back.

163
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:25,084
Mr. Supervisor?

164
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,625
Supervisor ready. What position is it?

165
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,917
Delta sector, sir.
They do not know about me very often.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,342
Yes, delta sector?

167
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:37,250
My scanners monitor the low
frequency direct band.

168
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,167
I'm getting some voices or something.

169
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:43,417
Sure you get pirate conversations.
There is no need to be alarmed.

170
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,667
Perhaps they are echoes of last
night's attack on the freighters.

171
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,750
Those signals will bounce all week.

172
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,917
Yes sir. I mean, no sir.
This is not an echo, sir.

173
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:55,584
It is a voice. It is a strong voice.
Is singing.

174
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,667
- Singing?
- Yes.

175
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:01,917
- Delta sector, did you say "singing"?
- Yes.

176
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:07,375
Operational control, I'm supervisor
14, give me the delta sector audio.

177
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,963
Answer, control of Houston.
Answer

178
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:29,667
Houston control, here the 711 flight.

179
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,375
Answer Do you receive me? Give me
instructions. I'm going to re-enter.

180
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:38,834
Answer, control of Houston.
Houston control, do you receive me?

181
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,084
Anden, papanatas, stop
slacking and give me "info".

182
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:45,334
It is practically a foreign language.

183
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,459
Is it a joke?

184
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:01,084
Goes directly to the protective shield.
Communicate me with interception.

185
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,459
With the interception squadron.

186
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm Colonel Deering.
What are the coordinates?

187
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:24,209
Right. Back the shield 160 km.
Until checking the ship.

188
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,834
Alert, interceptors.
Alien ship position.

189
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,959
- Thats weird.
- What's weird?

190
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,125
The target moves very slowly
and irregularly to be a ship.

191
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,334
I have the target in sight.

192
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,584
What is it?

193
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,584
Hey, good.
I'm glad to see you...

194
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,042
boys.

195
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,588
Who are they?

196
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:23,917
What are they?

197
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,134
Attention, alien ship.
Do you listen me?

198
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:29,209
I am "alien"?
You are not familiar.

199
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,625
Who are they?

200
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,834
Limit your answers to "yes" and \ x22.
It is in serious danger.

201
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,375
Whose? Of you?

202
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:38,042
It crosses a narrow corridor
that leads to the inner cities.

203
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,175
Cities what? Look, miss...

204
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:45,167
Colonel Deering. Now, keep silent.
If you leave the indicated route...

205
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,417
It will become steam, do you understand?

206
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:51,959
In steam? Yes Yes, I understand.
What should I do?

207
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,542
- Can you handle the ship manually?
- Clear.

208
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,750
Then, follow me very closely.

209
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,334
I'm after you.

210
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:15,625
This time they won us.
It must be the Russians.

211
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:20,917
He's doing fine.

212
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,550
- How do you say?
- I'm just trying to be friendly.

213
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,292
Violating our airspace is an
act of war, not friendship.

214
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,209
Wait until the Cape
guys find out.

215
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:40,167
Buck Rogers will land in
the center of Red Square.

216
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,500
Air control 1 access.

217
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:10,125
Cleared in the 1-0 corridor
Able for the approaching ship.

218
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,917
Confirmed. Open exterior
barriers for approach...

219
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,750
in the 1-0 corridor Able
for the approaching ship.

220
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,042
Hey, baby, what a great deal.

221
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,500
I'm Colonel Deering, commander
of Terrestrial Defense.

222
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,042
- You. Are you in charge of all this?
- Right.

223
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,000
- If there are no more questions...
- Hey, Colonel, quiet.

224
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,167
I would fly with you whenever you want.

225
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:54,834
- Interrogate this barbarian.
- What?

226
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,292
Listen. Hey, wait a moment!

227
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,709
I waited!

228
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,292
What... What do they do?
Hey, wait a minute!

229
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,792
How are you, Captain Rogers?

230
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,750
I am Dr. Huer.
I am very happy to meet you.

231
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,709
What is happening?
Where am I and what do they do to me?

232
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,671
We are studying it.
Everything is electronic and painless.

233
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:32,709
But we are as astonished as you.
For what happened.

234
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:35,459
But his tests give
us phenomenal data.

235
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,125
Fabulous. What is happening?

236
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,834
If I'm dead, I did not go to heaven.
What planet is this?

237
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,046
What planet?
Oh, it's Earth, of course.

238
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,417
He returned as his mission demanded...

239
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:52,042
to almost the precise area of
scheduled landing on your ship.

240
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,959
Look, doctor.

241
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,042
I've been through a lot...

242
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,250
but in no way will you tell me...

243
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,834
that that city is Chicago.

244
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:08,542
No, it is not. There is nothing
left on Earth like Chicago.

245
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,042
Allow me to bring my administrator, Dr.
Theopolis.

246
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:15,800
Look, doctor...

247
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,292
Twiki, could you bring Dr.
Theopolis, please?

248
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:30,358
- What is that?
- He is Twiki.

249
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,875
- It's your robot.
- My what?

250
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,125
During your report and determination...

251
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,167
Twiki will be your assistant.

252
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,092
And this...
This is Dr. Theopolis.

253
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,667
Good morning, Dr. Theopolis.
It is a beautiful day.

254
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,792
Thank you. I did my best.

255
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,542
Dr. Theopolis is a member
of the Computer Council.

256
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,417
And in addition to other
things, he is responsible...

257
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,000
of the environmental controls
of the Internal City.

258
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,375
This afternoon I will introduce
a touch of mauve at sunset.

259
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,292
Not as deep as an amethyst...

260
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,959
but a more subtle
texture like cinnamon.

261
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,425
That's good.

262
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,459
I hope the captain sees it with us.
It really will be lovely.

263
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,542
If it were you, I would talk to
the programmer about that thing.

264
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,334
Captain Rogers, it's
us, the Council...

265
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,334
those who do all the programming.

266
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,625
Please reserve your opinion.
Let's go to work.

267
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,042
Captain Rogers, I'll leave
you with some advice.

268
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,500
These androids were not
programmed by humans.

269
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,334
They have programmed each
other for generations.

270
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:37,342
You see, the mistakes we made...

271
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,900
in areas, then, as our environment...

272
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,367
they were totally in his hands.

273
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,634
And they saved the Earth
from a secure end.

274
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:48,084
Little by little we have recovered
to not depend totally...

275
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,209
from other planets in
terms of water and food.

276
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:53,000
Androids are not human, but...

277
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,125
You can hurt your feelings.

278
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,959
It is this sensitivity that
separates them from the machines.

279
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:04,292
I will see it again
in about 16 hours.

280
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,500
16 hours? Wait a moment!

281
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you think I'll stay here and
talk with a box for 16 hours?

282
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:15,125
Sit down, captain. Let's try
to be as pleasant as possible.

283
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,542
That's. Be a good robot, Twiki,
and put me on the table...

284
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,834
where I can see the captain well while
you bring him something to drink.

285
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,250
- I do not need anything to drink.
- Of course.

286
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:32,209
You're dehydrated from your
terrible experience, Buck.

287
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:33,959
If you allow me to call you Buck.

288
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,375
Now bring your drink to
Captain Rogers, Twiki.

289
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,584
Wow, you're a very attractive
man, Captain Buck Rogers.

290
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,759
Look, I've been waiting 24 hours...

291
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:56,375
to find out where I am,
who I am, who you are.

292
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,292
Could you give me some answers?

293
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:02,334
Of course, Buck. That's why I'm
here, to answer your questions.

294
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,959
Great. Begins.

295
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,125
You are Captain Buck Rogers, and
according to your ship's diary...

296
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:09,042
You left Earth in 1987.

297
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,709
I already know that. Tell
me what I do not know.

298
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:15,750
If the preliminary data is valid,
it seems that you came back...

299
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,875
to Earth 504 years later.

300
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,709
Now you are in the XXV century.

301
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,667
Buck? Are you okay, Buck?

302
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,584
You heard me?

303
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,542
I think I'm going to drink now.

304
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,542
I assure.
He is a wonderful man. Trust me.

305
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,084
I think you think he's
a wonderful man...

306
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,000
but you do not risk lives...

307
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,084
of our surviving warriors
for their subterfuge.

308
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:53,542
He is only a man. How could
it endanger our people?

309
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,125
I could discredit the
treaty with Draconia.

310
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,983
He has not tried to do that.
He came to us bewildered.

311
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:03,917
I want the opportunity to
spend time with our captain.

312
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
If you look for a defect in
your testimony, you lose time.

313
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,375
Saving Earth is not
a waste of time...

314
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:11,796
despite supporting the
company of the captain.

315
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:14,334
Well, if Dr. Theopolis
has no objection...

316
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,167
I don't have any.

317
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,384
I have no objection.

318
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,667
The captain belongs to
me until I unmask him.

319
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,004
I had never seen
Colonel Deering...

320
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:31,584
so unusually emotional about something.

321
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,542
Nor about someone.

322
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,500
This part seems more a
dream than a nightmare.

323
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:46,959
Look, my behavior yesterday was
inappropriate. I want to apologize.

324
00:25:47,084 --> 00:25:49,167
I accept your apology, captain.

325
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:54,625
Tell me about the holocaust.

326
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,667
I can not.

327
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,084
Well, it's not real until
you hear it and feel it.

328
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,634
I lost everything that
was important to me.

329
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:07,292
Mother, father, brothers,
sisters, a woman he loved.

330
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,167
If I do not hear something
that convinces me...

331
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:13,917
They will be waiting for me
somewhere in time and space.

332
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,750
- How is the exterior?
- From the city? I would not like it.

333
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,959
- Radiation?
- In some places.

334
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:24,084
The rest are ruins and scorched earth.

335
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,875
We depend on trade
with other planets.

336
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:30,796
Tell me about the trade agreement with
the draconians and with the princess.

337
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:34,834
The pirates who cut our transport
routes kill us with hunger.

338
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,500
The draconians promised
to keep them open...

339
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,667
in exchange for giving them
landing privileges on Earth.

340
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,792
I would like to see my ship.
It's possible?

341
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:46,250
Anything is possible, captain.

342
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:51,042
Those guards thought it was
crazy to come at this time.

343
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,542
I already slept an eternity.

344
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,167
Do you recognize those brands?

345
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,000
They are common in ships
that were in combat.

346
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,667
Well, I was not in combat.
You. They shot me?

347
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:05,709
- Of course not.
- Then who?

348
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,667
Maybe the pirates who attacked us.

349
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:11,250
And why am I still here?
Why did not they kill me?

350
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:13,667
Why did not they strip
her or open her?

351
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,959
The pirates are meticulous, they
would check an unarmed ship...

352
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
especially one that was shot.

353
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:24,417
He was in flight a long time.
Anything could happen.

354
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,334
Those brands are new.
Cordite has not oxidized.

355
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,125
I think Princess Ardala's
ships shot me...

356
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,842
before towing me inside his ship.

357
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:37,250
- Your ship is unarmed. Is the law.
- Well, it seems he's raping her.

358
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,884
What do you suggest, Captain?

359
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:43,000
Have them check their ship before letting
it go through its protective shield.

360
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:47,292
It would be an insult.
The alliance is based on good faith.

361
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:51,542
Good faith is for bureaucrats and
what gives them a protected city.

362
00:27:51,742 --> 00:27:54,509
I would go armed to the teeth
or they will be easy prey.

363
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:58,542
For someone whose expertise
is five centuries old...

364
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,584
You seem to be very inflexible.

365
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,459
Is right.

366
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:06,000
It's not my business how
they ruin your world.

367
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,810
My generation did not know
what I was doing either.

368
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:10,018
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Where are you going, Captain?

369
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:12,917
- I'll go around the city.
- He's under suspicion. Can not.

370
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,042
I have to find out what
changed in 500 years.

371
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:18,959
- That is forbidden.
- Is a free country. At least, it was.

372
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:22,792
He is arrested and is my prisoner.
I can not let him go.

373
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,625
He will have to shoot me to stop me.

374
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:27,042
It does not leave me an alternative.

375
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:38,634
You did not have to come with me.

376
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:42,292
I wanted to be with you.
I wish you listened to reasons.

377
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,750
This is nothing compared
to what awaits us.

378
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,917
- Why do not we spend the night here?
- Oh, we would die frozen.

379
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:53,384
The heat that you feel is
emanated by the Inner City.

380
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:56,834
Within a few hours, the energy
will be reduced by two thirds...

381
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,442
and the temperature here
will be below zero.

382
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:02,125
So, I guess we have to continue.

383
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,967
I'm sorry I brought them.

384
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,750
They assigned me to be with you.

385
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:11,125
No one forced me to be on your side.
I believed in you and I still do it.

386
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,209
What did he say?

387
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,250
- You do not want to know.
- Oh.

388
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,768
- What did he say now?
- You do not want to know.

389
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,334
Come back I can face
whatever is there...

390
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,625
if it helps me discover
what happened to my people.

391
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,334
I'll stay with you, Buck.

392
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,342
- What did he say?
- You do not want to know.

393
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,917
- Stop saying that! I want to know.
- He thinks they're watching us.

394
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,084
It's just your imagination. Walking.

395
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:25,542
- It is impossible. Totally impossible.
- We'll be fine.

396
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,917
- It's not you they want.
- What?

397
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,542
Do not be offended,
but they want us.

398
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,625
My gold circuits are worth
a lot in the black market.

399
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:43,625
And as for Twiki, well, I'd hate
to tell you how they'll use it.

400
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,625
Buck, where are you going?

401
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,750
STATE STREET

402
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,625
It's here.

403
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,750
I do not want to question
your strategy, Buck...

404
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,417
but to stop in the middle
of the street is stupid...

405
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:04,375
Given the circumstances.

406
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,125
Come!

407
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,000
I do not know where he is going.
Just follow him.

408
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,875
I do not know what he does.
Just follow him, Twiki.

409
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,292
- Holy...
- I know, Twiki.

410
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,042
I see them. Just keep going.

411
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:05,709
Do not think about that.
Your batteries will be exhausted.

412
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,167
Here my parents are buried.

413
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,209
At least I already know a part.

414
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,875
We can not stay long, Buck.
They are following us.

415
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:31,292
What happened? There is only one
gravestone, it has no date.

416
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,917
They only buried some lucky ones.

417
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,334
It happened so fast that they
buried the families together.

418
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:40,709
The systems fell and the dates
stopped being important.

419
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,084
In the end, there were
no armies or fighting.

420
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:47,125
Only hunger, pollution
and prolonged death.

421
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,500
- I wish I had been with them.
- You can not go back, Buck.

422
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:56,459
The past is gone. But you can
help us with our future.

423
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,584
If there is a future.
I think it's too late.

424
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,709
Run, Twiki.

425
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,209
Watch out!

426
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:50,209
Damned...

427
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,584
They are too many, Buck, it has no case.

428
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:36,250
If someone has some final words,
now it's time to say them.

429
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,875
Let's get out of here.

430
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:33,709
Go, Colonel. What brings you
here on a night like this?

431
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,417
Captain, I came to look for
you with great danger for me.

432
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,425
- Very courageous.
- Very what?

433
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:43,792
Forget it.
Well, do not expect a fanfare.

434
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,334
We were fine until you arrived.
Right, Theo?

435
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,250
- Well...
- Forget it, Theo.

436
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,925
Well, at least Twiki is on my side.

437
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:55,292
I like it here. It's a bit primitive,
but it's the south side of Chicago.

438
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,292
Captain, we waste our time. Let's move on.

439
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,834
I still do not finish.
So unless I'm going to shoot myself...

440
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:04,292
Captain, he escaped once, but not now.
Lieutenant.

441
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,917
What is the problem?

442
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,959
So, it does work for pirates.

443
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:21,084
- I still can not believe it.
- Well, you're the only one, Theo.

444
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:24,167
This microtransmitter was
on your navigation device.

445
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:26,750
Revealed our secret
access corridors.

446
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,125
This is not how an innocent man behaves.

447
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,042
At first I thought I was guilty.
And later...

448
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:35,375
They are subjective in their
evaluation of Buck Rogers.

449
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,625
I, on the other hand, support
it for practical reasons.

450
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,834
- And which are they?
- I'm convinced of something.

451
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:45,250
Our friend, Captain Rogers,
met Princess Ardala...

452
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,250
and was aboard the draconian ship.

453
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,750
Your descriptions
are too precise...

454
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,467
to be the conjectures of a pirate.

455
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,042
Maybe the pirates boarded that
ship and gave him the information.

456
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,334
Precious, they are the
deadliest enemies.

457
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:01,167
It is unlikely that a pirate
survived such a visit...

458
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,792
to tell it.

459
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,042
There's news from Captain Rogers.

460
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,625
They intercepted her
ship and escorted her...

461
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,375
as I expected.

462
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:32,625
The transmitter that we installed in your
ship gave us the necessary information...

463
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:35,354
so that my father crosses the shield?

464
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,084
Yes, but they discovered the transmitter.

465
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,009
- That bad.
- That does not change things.

466
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:43,667
When we enter, we will destroy
the shield from within.

467
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,917
The earthlings will not suspect...

468
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,209
when he tells you he was here?

469
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:52,792
They will not believe you. We can
give Captain Rogers for dead.

470
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:57,050
Stop worrying about the trial.

471
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,875
I am a member of the Council and
I will personally defend you.

472
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:05,250
Thanks, Theo.
It is good to have at least one friend.

473
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,584
Forgive me, Twiki. Two friends.

474
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:13,000
The Council is ready to
hear the final arguments...

475
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:15,334
in the case against
Captain Buck Rogers...

476
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:18,467
on charges of espionage and treason.

477
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:22,125
- Lawyer Apol.
- The case of the State is elementary.

478
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:25,542
The captain flew through
our defense network...

479
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,917
with a microtransmitter, revealing
the accesses of the shield.

480
00:38:29,117 --> 00:38:32,759
What reward would you consider fair...

481
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:36,417
Captain Rogers for selling
to the human race?

482
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,625
Only your pirate
friends can respond.

483
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:41,000
But I maintain that in my opinion...

484
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,917
what they seek at all costs is the
destruction of the treaty with Draconia.

485
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:48,084
Since its promulgation
means its downfall.

486
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,417
The State finished presenting its case.

487
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,292
Now we will hear the defense.
Dr. Theopolis.

488
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,084
Distinguished colleagues,
you heard the evidence...

489
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:03,084
and I challenge you to
find this man guilty.

490
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:07,375
There is no evidence to indicate
that he was born on this planet...

491
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:09,584
because we all know very well...

492
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:13,334
that there are no records
prior to the great holocaust.

493
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,375
He can not explain how the
transmitter came to his ship...

494
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
because it is not his work.

495
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:22,042
He is an innocent pawn in a great war.

496
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,709
I tell you, colleagues, if
you find this man guilty...

497
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,875
You must find me guilty.

498
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,042
My sensors tell me
that this man is good.

499
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:35,209
The defense finished presenting its case.
Thank you.

500
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:39,584
Captain Rogers, do you have any last
words before we give the ruling?

501
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm just an innocent pawn, a
puppet, whatever they call me.

502
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,834
It was another who manipulated me.

503
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:54,750
They should worry less about
me and more about them.

504
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:59,250
Because I can not harm them anymore
no matter what the result is today.

505
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,000
But he or she...

506
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:05,125
I could destroy them.

507
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,000
Very good, Buck.
We do not have to worry.

508
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,375
Unanimously, the Council
rules in favor of the State.

509
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,917
Captain Rogers, the
Council finds you guilty.

510
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,792
Your life will end.

511
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:30,834
The execution will be
carried out immediately.

512
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,750
The session is over.

513
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,834
I can not believe it.

514
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,084
Will not say anything?

515
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:53,025
- Do not.
- That's ridiculous.

516
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:56,042
He was sentenced to death.

517
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:59,959
At the very least, he would think that
a man of his type would be furious...

518
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:02,667
that would attack me verbally,
that I would say something.

519
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,209
Goodbye?

520
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,375
Buck, enough.
It is being unreasonable.

521
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,000
Am I being unreasonable?

522
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:15,213
It is almost as if he believed that
the sentence will not be carried out.

523
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:19,542
I do not think there is anyone
here who carries out the sentence.

524
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,342
I know that you will not be in charge.

525
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:25,750
He still clings to his story
that the Draconia is armed.

526
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,667
I can prove it.

527
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,125
What would you say if I said...

528
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,542
I came to give you that opportunity?

529
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,125
How?

530
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,334
We will go to the Draconia
flagship to verify its history...

531
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,417
that they found it.

532
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,667
And will they investigate
while they are there?

533
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:48,292
Exact.

534
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,084
No no. I...
I do not like that plan.

535
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,667
- It worries me.
- Why?

536
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,334
Well, you see, my
execution is scheduled.

537
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,384
If I do not show up,
I'll get in trouble.

538
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:07,292
You are impossible. Do I offer his
life and he answers me with jokes?

539
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,209
That's what it means.

540
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:14,125
Does it offer to end my
execution or just postpone it?

541
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:19,209
If he shows that his story is real...

542
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,459
Walking.

543
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:38,167
Stay close to my ship.
The maneuvers will be simple.

544
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,334
Stay on automatic pilot.
It will only control the acceleration.

545
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,459
Thanks, colonel.

546
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,834
Can I look out the window?

547
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,634
This is no time for
frivolities, Captain.

548
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:50,834
The pirates destroyed a
third of our ships here.

549
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:52,834
When they attack, they attack fast.

550
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,667
It can not beat the computer.

551
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,442
It will take evasive measures
to evade its missiles.

552
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,334
If you try to fly, it
will only cost one ship.

553
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,334
I appreciate your concern.

554
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:04,542
I wish I had brought a book.

555
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,800
I have a goal in vector 401.

556
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,584
Aware, Colonel.
I see the target to port.

557
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,625
If you see it at this distance...

558
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,834
It must be giant.

559
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:27,667
Permit to board? Why?

560
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,962
He is a special envoy.

561
00:43:30,162 --> 00:43:32,175
That's all I know.

562
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,542
This does not conform to the protocol.

563
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:38,125
- What do you think they're up to?
- I don't know.

564
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:40,250
But they warned us in advance.

565
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,334
And there will be nothing that betrays us.

566
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:45,500
I would like to know what they are up to.

567
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's prepare them a
very special welcome.

568
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:52,500
Send our pirate ships.

569
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:54,917
And prepare a surprise for them.

570
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:09,084
Welcome aboard the
Draconia flagship...

571
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:12,050
sent from Draco,
conqueror of space...

572
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,292
leader of Astrium, ruler
of the draconian kingdom.

573
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:19,417
I present your daughter,
Princess Ardala.

574
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,792
Haunted.
This is an unexpected pleasure.

575
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:25,125
We can hardly receive
them properly.

576
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,009
Your time is an adequate reception.

577
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,959
I am Col. Deering, commander of the
3rd Terrestrial Council Force.

578
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:34,209
And I think you already
know Captain Rogers.

579
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:37,667
No. If I had met a young
and dashing captain...

580
00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:39,792
I would surely remember it vividly.

581
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,542
I do not think we had the pleasure.

582
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,542
I think he's wrong, princess.

583
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,209
I never forget a knuckle.

584
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:52,542
- Captain.
- We want to get to the bottom of the matter.

585
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:56,459
Do I describe some of
the interior cameras?

586
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,300
What interior cameras are you referring to?

587
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,459
I do not find it memorable,
but I will never forget it.

588
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:06,084
I especially liked the
high neck dress and...

589
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:10,459
Colonel Deering, what's wrong?
Why you came?

590
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,000
Pirates are in this sector.

591
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,167
We came to make sure
they arrived safely.

592
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,092
Alert! Alert! Alert!

593
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:28,500
Hostile ships attack the Draconia.

594
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,042
And Captain Rogers...

595
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,625
All staff to their
defense posts.

596
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:36,542
- Men, to your ships!
- Alert to all posts!

597
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,625
This is how they offer us protection.

598
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:42,500
Go escort.
At least we will die together.

599
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,459
Clear launch channels to attack.

600
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,167
Alert!! Alert!

601
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,917
Care, greater. It is behind you.

602
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:46,000
Climb, I'll intercept it.

603
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:50,209
Not there! He goes to his sight!

604
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,334
Captain Rogers, I ordered
you not to interfere.

605
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,084
Colonel, you need all
the help available.

606
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,167
- Bandit at 12.00, up.
- At 12.00 what?

607
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:11,209
Lieutenant Wrather, ignore it.
Captain Rogers, shut up.

608
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,209
Computers are superior to you.

609
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:16,292
If your computers do not
do something fast...

610
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,455
they're going to eliminate
their lieutenant Wrather.

611
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:24,917
Be careful, Thornberry!

612
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:29,250
Colonel, you must change to manual flight.

613
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:31,709
If it does not stop
distracting our pilots...

614
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:34,917
Help the lieutenant.
There are a couple of pirates behind you.

615
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,417
I'll change to manual, Colonel.

616
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:41,792
Let's see if I can share
what we have been receiving.

617
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:43,917
Buck Rogers, I order
him to return to base.

618
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:51,500
Now let's see if they like to send
the defensive load to the old one.

619
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:13,542
I destroyed one. Six are missing.

620
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:20,334
I gave you!

621
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,217
- Lower and turn on the rear propellers!
- I can not!

622
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,167
It goes against the principles
of modern air combat.

623
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:56,917
That is called sending the
load with the linebackers.

624
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,209
I do not know what happened
to the combat computers...

625
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,709
but thanks.

626
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:11,959
Now, captain, let's go home.

627
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:16,254
- Mine or yours?
- What?

628
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,375
- What did he say?
- Just kidding.

629
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:20,584
Air control 1 access.

630
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:24,625
1-0 Runner Able cleared
for approaching ship.

631
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:30,292
Confirmed. Open exterior
barriers for approach...

632
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:34,125
in the 1-0 Able corridor
for the approaching ship.

633
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:43,125
Colonel Deering, have you
seen Captain Rogers?

634
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,667
Yes because?

635
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,042
The Council received a request
from Princess Ardala.

636
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,000
What does that have to do with the captain?

637
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,967
She thinks that he only saved...

638
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,417
to his unarmed ship of
the renegade pirates...

639
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,334
and he wants to thank you personally.

640
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,042
He alone?

641
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,542
Apparently, they almost
destroy your ship too.

642
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,917
If it was not for Captain
Rogers' ability...

643
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,842
and his quick reaction,
the princess thinks...

644
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:10,292
I do not care about the opinion of the
princess. I know what happened. I was there.

645
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,625
Tomorrow I will conquer Earth.

646
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:20,917
Tomorrow we will conquer
the Earth, your highness.

647
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,542
You look great, Buck.

648
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:49,667
Something bothers you?

649
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,175
Why did you invite me to this?
Nobody believes me.

650
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:56,334
Princess Ardala wants to thank you for
protecting her ship from pirates.

651
00:50:57,542 --> 00:51:00,625
I would also like to tell you something...
In private.

652
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:02,625
I'm sure they will not allow it.

653
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:04,834
After all, you're just a captain.

654
00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:07,334
And you do not even have
an officer's degree.

655
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:11,542
- Do you have something for the headache?
- You feel bad?

656
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,209
I guess I'm not fully
recovered from my trip.

657
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:17,917
Why did not you say something?
Twiki will bring you a relaxing one.

658
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:20,792
Well, it's time to enter.

659
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:23,542
Let's not wait for the
trade delegation.

660
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,917
Welcome.
The draconian trade delegation...

661
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,917
under the leadership of
his royal highness...

662
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:53,459
the princess of the kingdom. Ardala.

663
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,750
I bring you greetings on
this historic occasion.

664
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,709
My father, King Draco...

665
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:05,667
wants to give them their
flagship Draconia...

666
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:09,959
full of the latest technology.
It symbolizes a new glorious era...

667
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:12,542
of commerce and peace.

668
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:18,209
Let the celebration begin.

669
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,875
We brought you some pills, Buck.

670
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:40,167
For your headache.
It is a very strong relaxant.

671
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:42,584
Do not take more than one at a time.

672
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,375
Thanks guys.

673
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:48,542
I see that the dance has
advanced a lot in 500 years.

674
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:00,875
I will need something else. A rose.

675
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,917
- You said a rose?
- Yes, red.

676
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,375
- What do you need a rose for?
- Twiki, can you bring me a quick one?

677
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:20,459
Do you like our presentation,
Captain Rogers?

678
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,959
Is awesome.

679
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:27,542
Did this folkloric dance
come from your dad's world?

680
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:31,092
Excuse me, but I did not
understand what he said.

681
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:35,125
And I suggest you use a more
respectful reference than "dad".

682
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,584
Maybe he's the greatest
leader we know.

683
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:39,917
I'll give you a warning, Colonel.

684
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:44,917
- Beware of gifts from the Greeks.
- The Greeks?

685
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,834
That was before you were born.
A long time ago.

686
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,917
Tell me, do you know the
history of the Trojan horse?

687
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:54,584
Do not.

688
00:53:54,709 --> 00:53:57,084
No, huh? Well, forget it.

689
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,584
I guess I'm from a time
that was paranoid.

690
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:01,584
See you.

691
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:11,167
- Your rose, Buck.
- How cute. Thanks, Twiki.

692
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:14,167
Buck, nobody gave flowers
to the princess.

693
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,967
You will make everyone look ridiculous.

694
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:18,834
Do not separate, friends.
We follow.

695
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:29,592
Go, Captain Rogers.
Congratulations and thanks.

696
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:33,417
We are grateful to you for saving
us from those horrible corsairs.

697
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,792
Not so strong. Here they believe
that I am a corsair, thanks to you.

698
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:43,500
To me? I wish I had not made
him go through much shame.

699
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,334
- Are you angry?
- From...

700
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:48,500
- The O!
- What a great body.

701
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,792
- From me to you.
- Who is your lovely little friend?

702
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,500
It's called Twiki.

703
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:00,084
Yes, and that thing hanging
from his neck is Theo...

704
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,925
Member of the Computer Council.

705
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,709
- Your Majesty.
- Do you want to dance with me?

706
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:07,750
- The princess does not...
- It does not bother me to dance.

707
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,125
I'm not up to date with these steps.

708
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,417
If you have a preference...
It's my party.

709
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:43,917
Fantastic.
How about something old-fashioned?

710
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:48,209
Sir, excuse me. Do you know rock?
You know...

711
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:51,292
Try it, try it Ande.

712
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:57,917
No, no, that's not it. Just let yourself go. Let
go. Let yourself be carried away by the music.

713
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,292
That's. Right. Yes. That's. Yes.

714
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,467
That makes?

715
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,834
It's called juerguear.
It's old. If you scare her...

716
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,467
Nothing scares me.

717
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,875
Very good. Come stomping.

718
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,792
- It's expressive.
- It's nasty!

719
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:53,917
- What happens if we crash?
- Automatically we are husband and wife.

720
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:57,000
Great. A juerguear.

721
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,917
You are a special
man, Captain Rogers.

722
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,500
I think the earthlings
believed his story...

723
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:05,834
of having been frozen 500 years.

724
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:09,959
- It is not like this. They think I'm a spy.
- My own?

725
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:14,213
- They are not sure.
- Do you want to join me?

726
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:17,542
- Who do I talk to negotiate with?
- With me.

727
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:21,375
Tell me, is that building still
the communications center?

728
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:25,084
It is secret information.

729
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,667
Of course.

730
00:57:28,834 --> 00:57:30,750
I will always be one of you, Dr. Huer.

731
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:34,334
Maybe I'll stay
here permanently.

732
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,834
We hope so.

733
00:57:53,084 --> 00:57:56,250
Your Highness, some ministers
want to talk to you.

734
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,417
- Then, Kane.
- The affairs of the kingdom come first!

735
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:03,250
His father hopes that it serves
the interests of the kingdom.

736
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:05,384
If you do not...

737
00:58:05,584 --> 00:58:08,542
He has another 29 daughters who will!

738
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:20,042
It was a pleasure, Captain
Rogers, but we must do our duty.

739
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:23,875
Later?

740
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,750
I'll leave on my private
ship at midnight.

741
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:29,834
I'll be there.

742
00:58:35,584 --> 00:58:38,167
Captain Rogers.

743
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,125
I would like to know if it is
a good time to talk to you.

744
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,459
The princess left suddenly...

745
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:46,125
and it seems that the party was over.

746
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,317
He has no plans, do he?

747
00:58:48,517 --> 00:58:50,584
- Well...
- Very good.

748
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,900
- There's something I want to say.
- Well I...

749
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,375
I thought he was a
spy, Captain Rogers.

750
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,459
I was wrong.

751
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,375
Do you want to go somewhere else?

752
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:29,500
I'm not ready for that yet.

753
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:33,463
I have not done it for a long time.
500 years.

754
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:37,542
My reintegration should be calm.

755
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,042
Do not worry.

756
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,625
Better listen to it, friend.
It is reasonable.

757
01:00:01,709 --> 01:00:04,209
I asked Captain Rogers
to accompany us.

758
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:07,750
You're lucky not to fight with me.

759
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,709
We are almost there.

760
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,084
Where are you going?

761
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,625
I know it's cold, but
we have no choice.

762
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,959
We have orders to
stay close to Buck.

763
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,834
And maybe he needs us, so he
goes back to the refrigerator.

764
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:36,417
Twiki, I'm talking to you.

765
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,959
I freeze the ball bearings.

766
01:00:43,417 --> 01:00:46,667
Captain Rogers does
not appear anywhere.

767
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,384
What did you expect from a primitive?

768
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:51,959
We will let you know if we
know anything about him.

769
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:56,667
You're a spy, Buck Rogers...

770
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,250
and I know exactly where you are.

771
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,042
Outside.

772
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,125
They are better pets if you castrate them.

773
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,750
Let's get comfortable.
Serve us something to drink.

774
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:36,000
At last we are alone.

775
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:57,167
You will not say anything?

776
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,792
Until this moment I did not
know what I was missing.

777
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:01,709
I also have to confess something.

778
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,959
Is there a man waiting for you at home?

779
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,167
I had not realized
what I was missing.

780
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:10,942
You are different. You are arrogant.

781
01:02:11,142 --> 01:02:13,667
You flagrantly ignore the orders.

782
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,625
And you're the kind of man who
could overthrow my father.

783
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,500
Overthrowing your father is
the last thing on my mind.

784
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:23,000
- I brought you here for a reason.
- I was counting on that.

785
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:25,542
I want you by my side.

786
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:28,750
That was not exactly
what I was thinking.

787
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:31,292
Consider it.

788
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:35,542
You have no idea what it is to be the
daughter of Draco the Conqueror.

789
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:38,000
29 sisters on your heels.

790
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:42,792
Cortesanos snitches like
Kane competing for power.

791
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:47,625
But with a man...
a true man like you...

792
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:53,292
I could challenge my father,
I could live my own life.

793
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:56,625
- Yes?
- A new magnificent dynasty.

794
01:02:56,709 --> 01:02:59,042
Are not you getting ahead of the facts?

795
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,834
Now give me my drink.

796
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,959
- We have to be very careful.
- Oh yeah?

797
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:21,384
The moment is not the right one.

798
01:03:21,584 --> 01:03:24,250
Things never change.
This has always been the case.

799
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:27,709
Why did not I meet you
before, Buck Rogers?

800
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,125
We have a lot of time, do not we?

801
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:42,125
Weapons personnel show up on the
platform to load the weapons.

802
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:44,292
Look, they're sleeping down there.

803
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:47,459
The fools will never know what happened.

804
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:52,459
I am very relaxed.
Can you turn off the lights?

805
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,342
If you are a spy, I will have to kill you.

806
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:15,667
If those are the things you say
in bed, I found your problem.

807
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:33,792
This is not good at all, Twiki.

808
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:35,334
There are soldiers everywhere...

809
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,792
and we do not even know where to
start looking for Captain Rogers.

810
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:16,375
Caramba!

811
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:19,125
Let's see if we can find your pajamas.

812
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:46,125
The pirate ships. This is how they could
attack us. It was his own people.

813
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,709
- Where is the Tiger Man?
- I do not know, sir.

814
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,292
Go away!

815
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:42,588
Did you wake up, my love?

816
01:06:42,788 --> 01:06:45,667
Did you wake up, baby?

817
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:48,792
Shoot him!

818
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:54,875
Outside! Take it out!
Take it out! Execute it!

819
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:59,209
- No. Take him for questioning.
- Are you giving a counter order?

820
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:02,167
Under the circumstances, yes.

821
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,875
Obey me.

822
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:06,459
Take it.

823
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,584
You will have to give me explanations.

824
01:07:17,709 --> 01:07:19,625
Do I have to explain?

825
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:23,542
Well, it's not a Gucci,
but what does it matter?

826
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,709
I do not want to be caught either.

827
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:37,084
But something is very wrong and
we must find out what it is.

828
01:07:38,209 --> 01:07:41,375
I hope you know that this
violates my guarantee.

829
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:45,125
Obviously she has been... very worried.

830
01:07:45,209 --> 01:07:48,125
Then I'll take care of
you for your insolence.

831
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:50,375
Give the order to attack now.

832
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,542
We can not attack without the
support of his father's forces.

833
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:55,917
Kane, how weak you are!

834
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:59,875
We do not need my father.
We have the element of surprise.

835
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:03,334
We will destroy the Inner City
and the protective shield.

836
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:05,667
When my father's
forces arrive...

837
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:07,634
we will be sitting on the
throne of the Earth.

838
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,709
At least I do, since obviously
you do not have the courage.

839
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:16,459
Very well, we will attack.

840
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:19,542
It's a wise decision, Kane.

841
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:23,584
Meanwhile, Captain Rogers
is loose on the ship.

842
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,500
Find them.

843
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,375
Alert!! Alert!

844
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:33,334
Intruder aboard the ship.

845
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:37,000
Alert! Alert! Alert!

846
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:39,592
It's Buck.

847
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:42,375
I see.
Bring on the enemy's uniform.

848
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,250
This will warm your tail.

849
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:58,667
They are warships.
It means that the treaty is a hoax.

850
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:02,292
But we can do a last
service to our country.

851
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,834
We can take care of Captain Rogers.

852
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:10,250
Six minutes to attack and count.

853
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:27,250
Five minutes to attack and count.

854
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:31,500
- Do not move, Captain Rogers.
- Theo, Twiki, what are you doing here?

855
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:35,875
- This will not be pleasing to anyone.
- Can you go? I have work to do.

856
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:39,417
- We realize, traitor.
- Do not you realize what's going on?

857
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,459
- I'd say they're going to bomb the Earth.
- Do you recognize the ships?

858
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:46,542
- No, but I do not see how...
- They are pirate ships.

859
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:50,375
Why would there be pirate ships
in the draconian flagship?

860
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:53,417
Forgives. You do not convince me.
Now join us.

861
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:55,917
- 4 minutes to attack and counting.
- Do not.

862
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,584
Look, pile of electronic nonsense, I do
not expect you to know everything...

863
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:02,542
But did you hear that the
bombs were in the tubes?

864
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,375
Silence, Twiki.
I'm getting confused

865
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,667
I'll help you clarify things. There are
no pirate ships, there never were.

866
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:13,209
They are draconian bombers
disguised as looters.

867
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,542
They interrupted the routes to
force them to sign the treaty.

868
01:10:18,084 --> 01:10:20,459
Of course.
It's witty, if it's true.

869
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,209
Three minutes to attack and count.

870
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:25,375
You have ten seconds to decide
if you believe me or Kane.

871
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:28,542
- Go alternative.
- And you do you think?

872
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,634
- Can not you see I'm telling the truth?
- Yes.

873
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:34,500
If you do not want to become spare
parts, follow your instincts.

874
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:38,834
Well, but only if you help
us reach a communicator...

875
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,792
to be able to warn
the Inner City.

876
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:43,125
They will have to do it alone.

877
01:10:43,209 --> 01:10:46,084
I have to make sure these
ships do not take off.

878
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:50,209
Commander Kane. There is an
unconscious guard on platform three.

879
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:53,375
- Two minutes to attack.
- Time is up, Theo.

880
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:55,959
- They found the guard I knocked out.
- Very good.

881
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:58,542
We will do our part.
Good luck, Buck.

882
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:18,125
Come to the console, Twiki.

883
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:22,050
Now, take the center panel.

884
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:25,875
- Ninety seconds to attack.
- Let it go.

885
01:11:25,959 --> 01:11:29,042
Grab the circuits and pull them.

886
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:40,459
80 seconds to attack and count.

887
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:46,584
70 seconds to attack and count.

888
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:53,917
Come to the microphone.

889
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:55,921
60 seconds to attack and count.

890
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:58,084
Terrestrial Council, emergency channel.

891
01:11:58,209 --> 01:11:59,917
Answer please.

892
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,000
Colonel Deering online.

893
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:05,292
I'm Dr. Theopolis.

894
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:08,500
Yes doctor. Where are you?
Why are you calling here?

895
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:10,667
I'm aboard the Draconia ship.

896
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:13,750
I followed Captain Rogers as
I was ordered. Listen out.

897
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:17,209
The Draconia is not...
I repeat, it is not an unarmed ship.

898
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:19,209
It's full of bombers
ready to launch...

899
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,900
a large-scale attack
on the Inner City.

900
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,667
Where did they come from?
His platform was empty.

901
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:28,792
- Send the fighter squadrons now!
- Thank you Doctor. Good luck.

902
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:32,000
Dr. Huer, permission
to send the fighters.

903
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:39,667
20 seconds to attack and count.

904
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,792
Battle positions.

905
01:12:48,084 --> 01:12:49,584
Prepare for the launch!

906
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:56,250
- Ten seconds to attack.
- Prepare to attack.

907
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:59,592
Eight, seven, six...

908
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,459
five seconds for the launch.

909
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:04,667
Four three...

910
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,792
two one.

911
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:08,417
Attack!

912
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:22,875
What's going on? What happens?

913
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:29,542
- Our ships simply exploded.
- It is impossible!

914
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,000
Here the Earth Council.

915
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:46,792
Attack the bombers;
Us, to the main ship.

916
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:52,417
There are no bombers.
They explode as soon as they come out.

917
01:13:52,617 --> 01:13:54,042
That makes no sense.

918
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,709
Take out our warships!

919
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:09,125
Prepare to intercept.
Do not use combat computers.

920
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:10,209
I unplug it.

921
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:15,375
Ladéate to the right!
I shot him!

922
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,125
Two come below.
I'll shoot the one above.

923
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:43,375
I go after the other.

924
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,292
Take that and that!

925
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:23,459
Oh, hell.

926
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:37,375
You will be responsible for the
damage suffered by this platform.

927
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:00,750
I am very sorry that you have come to this.

928
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:10,042
In the center and inside!

929
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:15,417
Preparation for transmission
with King Draco.

930
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,084
In the name of the kingdom,
what is happening?

931
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:23,209
Are they attacking when my
ships are still hours away?

932
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,584
I only obey orders.

933
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:29,125
And the orders of whom you obeyed?

934
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:30,959
Those of your daughter, sir.

935
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:35,667
Did he order our ships to
disintegrate upon entering combat?

936
01:16:36,834 --> 01:16:40,375
If either of them survives the
greatest disaster in the kingdom...

937
01:16:40,459 --> 01:16:44,292
They will give me accounts!

938
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:52,042
Stop fighting the fighters, we
will destroy the mothership.

939
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:07,875
Emergency.!

940
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,671
Emergency.! Emergency!

941
01:17:12,871 --> 01:17:15,459
This was his work, your highness.

942
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:19,792
I should leave her to
burn with the ship...

943
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:23,042
But I want her alive so she can
render an account to her father.

944
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:26,000
I have an emergency
ferry ready to go.

945
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:30,792
It will bring us close enough
to his father's ships.

946
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:36,750
Emergency.! Emergency!

947
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,500
Emergency.!

948
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:52,667
Emergency.! Emergency!

949
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,667
The ship is going to explode.

950
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,709
Remove the ships from the impact area.
Theo, I'm going for you and Twiki.

951
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,759
Forget us. Save Buck - Buck?

952
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:07,459
Wilma, he destroyed the
entire fighter fleet alone.

953
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:10,542
- He sent us to warn you.
- See me on the flight deck.

954
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:12,917
We'll find Buck.

955
01:18:18,209 --> 01:18:20,667
Emergency.! Emergency!

956
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,125
Theo, Twiki, over here!

957
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,625
I'm glad to see you again, Buck.

958
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,250
- This powder magazine is going to explode.
- Help is on the way.

959
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,042
- How do you help?
- Wilma will come to rescue us.

960
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,542
What? You can not land here. He will die.

961
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,167
Emergency.! Emergency!

962
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:57,875
- Will explode.
- Over here, Buck. Through the smoke.

963
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:12,042
Cab! Cab!

964
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:20,417
- Let's move on. The powder magazine is going to explode.
- I have the same opinion. Get up.

965
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:47,175
Very well done.

966
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:51,084
Thank you. But we are
not out of danger yet.

967
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:10,417
We would already be the
rulers of the Earth...

968
01:20:10,617 --> 01:20:12,300
if Buck Rogers had not tackled!

969
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,834
He would not have been necessary
if you were more man.

970
01:20:19,042 --> 01:20:23,834
We owe you more than an
apology, Buck, especially me.

971
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:26,875
I confess that I thought the
princess had coaxed you.

972
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,834
Well, I'll say that she had the
best pair of... horns in the dance.

973
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:32,959
Yes, it was an attractive hat.

974
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,675
You will never be as man as Buck Rogers.

975
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,375
We'll see when we see Mr.
Rogers again.

976
01:20:41,459 --> 01:20:46,375
- And we will.
- I hope so.

977
01:20:48,917 --> 01:20:51,300
Buck...

978
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,000
I know I've been distant with you and cold.

979
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:58,042
I was afraid, afraid to get involved.

980
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:02,959
Now things will be
different between us.

981
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:05,084
I'm not just a professional.

982
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:07,334
I am as woman as the princess.

983
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,875
How good.

984
01:21:09,959 --> 01:21:13,209
And, from now on, I'll show you.

985
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:15,209
What?

986
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:18,167
Well, I guess we'll
never see Kane again...

987
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:19,917
nor the princess.

988
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,417
The eyes in front.

989
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:33,500
- You will get sick.
- Buck, I like you very much.
