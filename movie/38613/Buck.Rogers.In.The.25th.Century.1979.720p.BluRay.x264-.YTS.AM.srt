1
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:10,485
About 25 seconds. We have
complete clearance for launch.

2
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:14,368
- We are go. Twenty.
- Ten, nine, eight...

3
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:17,660
- seven, six, five...
- Ignition sequence starts...

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,159
Four, three, two, one, zero.

5
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:29,769
In the year 1987, at the
John F. Kennedy Space Center...

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,806
NASA launched the last of
America's deep space probes.

7
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:37,157
The payload perched on the nose
cone of the massive rocket...

8
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:41,438
was a one man exploration vessel.
Ranger 3.

9
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,711
On board this compact
starship a lone astronaut...

10
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,078
Captain William "Buck" Rogers...

11
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:51,406
was to experience cosmic forces
beyond all comprehension.

12
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:53,613
An awesome brush with death.

13
00:00:55,177 --> 00:00:58,696
In the wink of an eye, his life
support system were frozen by...

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,280
temperatures beyond imagination.

15
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,241
Ranger 3 was blown out of
its planned trajectory...

16
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:07,692
into an orbit a thousand times more vast.

17
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:11,801
An orbit which was to return the
ship full circle to its point of origin.

18
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,395
It's Mother Earth...

19
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:17,945
not in five months, but in 500 years.

20
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:23,269
For 500 years, Buck Rogers drifted
through a world in which...

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,735
reality and fantasy merged
into a timeless dream.

22
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,587
Alert! Alert!
Incoming hostile ship.

23
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:44,130
Clear all launch channels for attack.

24
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:04,669
Wait!

25
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:10,626
There's something about the ship.
I've not seen anything like it.

26
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:13,151
Prepare to take in in tow.

27
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,456
Envelop alien ship in force field...

28
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:19,730
and prepare her for
boarding the Draconia.

29
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,099
- Neurosystems transport.
- In transport.

30
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,679
Begin heart-lung procedure.

31
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,351
- Dilute a minor pressure agent.
- Transmitting.

32
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:58,264
Increase diogen and
crystalline in proportion.

33
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:02,394
Heart-lung response up
on 0.2 and increasing.

34
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:05,499
We're starting to receive
positive neurological signals.

35
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:08,412
He's alive.

36
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,888
Enter.

37
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:21,960
And what about our intruder is so
important, it could not wait, Kane?

38
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:25,171
The man lives.
I'm not sure why.

39
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,898
You're not sure why.
Is this a puzzle for me to decipher?

40
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,012
The puzzle is for me to decipher.

41
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:35,162
The ship is antiquated... unlike
anything I've seen in the star system...

42
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:36,742
or outside of history
books for that matter.

43
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,109
Kane, please.

44
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:41,844
He was frozen in a
combination of gases.

45
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,948
Oxygen, cryogen, ozone, metalon.

46
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:46,898
Almost a perfect balance.

47
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,907
Were these techniques use throughout the
galaxy for terminal illness and disease.

48
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:52,122
Yes, today.

49
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:54,739
However, there is another matter.
The man's ship.

50
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,810
Kane, you have one more minute.

51
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:59,029
His instrumentation was stopped...

52
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:02,559
frozen solid in the year 1987.

53
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,402
- Are you telling me...?
- That the man may be 500 years old.

54
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:11,300
- You're serious?
- Yes.

55
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:14,159
Frozen by elements so
instantaneous and perfect...

56
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,690
that he is fully preserved and living.

57
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,826
It's a fascinating thought.

58
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:28,993
- Preserved young or preserved old?
- Very young.

59
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:35,402
Any defects from the ordeal?

60
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:39,211
Fortunately for him, we're
quite advanced in cryogenics.

61
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:47,342
Well, I've never met a 500 year old man.
Prepare him for an audience.

62
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:50,397
I'm afraid he's liable
to be not too coherent.

63
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,999
I'll make allowances.

64
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:01,184
- Where I am?
- We ask the questions.

65
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,075
Who are you?

66
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,790
Captain Buck Rogers,
United States Air Force.

67
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,079
- Who are you?
- What did he say?

68
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:12,167
Something about a united states.

69
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:15,384
Captain, what is your destination?

70
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:19,091
- What is it?
- My head.

71
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,355
- Could I get an aspirin?
- What does he mean?

72
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:26,229
Probably some kind of anti-pain drug.

73
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,482
Give him something for his discomfort.

74
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,139
What is this place?

75
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,813
Where am I?

76
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:44,039
Who are you?

77
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,351
You're aboard the king's
flagship Draconia...

78
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:48,977
under command of the
royal princess Ardala.

79
00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:58,442
- Who?
- Where are you from.?

80
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,246
No. Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

81
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,996
What was that about a ship?

82
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:06,886
One of the king's fortresses on its
way to Earth on a peace mission.

83
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,021
On its way to Earth?

84
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:14,248
You mean you guys aren't from...?

85
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:16,185
I mean, we're not...

86
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:19,198
We're not on Earth?

87
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,848
I'm definitely going
to need that aspirin.

88
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:26,113
- Give it to him.
- Wait a second.

89
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:26,824
Oh!

90
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:28,387
Captain.

91
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,333
Bear in mind that you're a captive...

92
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:35,471
of a dynasty that has
conquered 3/4 of the universe.

93
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:38,419
You will answer carefully
if you value your life.

94
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,012
Are you a real life princess?

95
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:53,710
I think we've given our captain
a little too much medication.

96
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,806
No, no, I feel great.

97
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,174
The United States of America...

98
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,186
It was an empire on the planet
Earth some centuries ago.

99
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,295
Those royal tutors gave
you your money's worth.

100
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,723
Well, you're from Earth, Kane.
You should know better than I.

101
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,140
The United States had
perished almost 500 years ago.

102
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,851
Well, that would account for his
spacecraft, his clothes, the instruments.

103
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,868
I have a better explanation.
I think he's a very clever plant...

104
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,892
from the Federal Directorate of Earth.

105
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,704
- A plant?
- Yes.

106
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:33,956
An spy placed in our
path by their military.

107
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,558
They wouldn't dare. We come as a
royal envoy from my father's kingdom.

108
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,152
I am fully aware of your
father's stated purpose.

109
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,172
The guarantee trade between
Earth and the Draconian dynasty.

110
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,159
What possible reason could they
have in placing a spy on board?

111
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:48,003
To search our ship.

112
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,194
- To see if we're armed.
- I see.

113
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,303
- We couldn't allow that, could we?
- No.

114
00:10:56,148 --> 00:11:00,212
Then I'm to assume that I may
dispose of Captain Rogers as I see fit.

115
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,945
How you handle security
is your prerogative.

116
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,765
Come on, Tiger Man.

117
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,771
What a layout!
Wow!

118
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:30,607
- And how are we this morning?
- Terrific.

119
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,333
Hey! That's a coincidence.
I got a ship just like this.

120
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:34,958
Disconnect the medication.

121
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,062
Oh, don't do that.
I really love it.

122
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,790
- You'll be on your way very shortly.
- Great. Where are we going?

123
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,890
- You're going home.
- Great. Where is that?

124
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,960
- On Earth.
- Oh, right!

125
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,175
Your ship has been serviced and
reprogrammed to take you home.

126
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,357
- I sure you must be anxious.
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:53,164
Seems like I haven't
been there for weeks.

128
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,913
Oh. Oh.

129
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,313
I must be having a great
time with you guys.

130
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:04,196
You know I'm going to miss you.
Hey! I got a great idea.

131
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,070
Why don't we all go
down there together?

132
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,054
You go on ahead.
We'll be along in a few days.

133
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,899
Not if I wake up.

134
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,158
Bye bye.
Oh, am I dreaming this?

135
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:28,017
Boy, they're going to be surprised back in
Houston when I come back with this story.

136
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,619
Battery.

137
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:43,153
Prepare to launch
the alien vessel.

138
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,078
Five seconds to launch.
Four...

139
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,468
three two...

140
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,301
one. Launch.

141
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,159
It's given us the perfect opportunity
to test the Earth's defense shield.

142
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:02,573
What do you mean test it?

143
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,463
We know that anyone
entering the earth surface...

144
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,745
without a clearance is
immediately incinerated.

145
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:11,475
But if our captain is
a spy, as I believe...

146
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:13,350
they will escort him
through the shield...

147
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,306
along the narrow channel
only known to their military.

148
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:17,822
Well, how can this help us?

149
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:21,095
I've hidden a micro-transmitter
aboard Captain Rogers' ship...

150
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,529
which will send back the
equivalent of a guide map.

151
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:25,769
When we give the signal...

152
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,967
that guide map will be used by
your father's attack forces...

153
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:30,939
to pour through their defense shield.

154
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,189
What if our Captain
Rogers is not a spy?

155
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,236
Then, he will burn.

156
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:37,868
I see.

157
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:39,899
You don't look very pleased.

158
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,618
Of course I'm pleased.

159
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,944
It's just that I have this strange feeling
I'm going to see Captain Rogers again.

160
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,518
<i>Air control 1 to vessel Able, Baker 4.</i>

161
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:04,110
<i>Approach inner city a further 3/4.
Over.</i>

162
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:05,930
<i>What is your current
positioning and fuel supply?</i>

163
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,673
<i>Confirmed.</i>

164
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,714
This is Tartalia near the air control Long.
We are approximately...

165
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,159
<i>They do things...
they don't do, oh no...</i>

166
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:17,515
Houston Control, this is Flight 711.

167
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,429
Come in, Houston Control.

168
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,476
Put down your cards and
your backgammon boards.

169
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:22,921
Lucky Buck is back.

170
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,481
Ah... Sir. Super?

171
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,964
Super on.
What station is this?

172
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:32,219
Delta sector, sir.
You don't hear from me very often.

173
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,972
Yes, yes Delta sector?

174
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:37,432
My scanners monitor the low
frequency direct communication band.

175
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,322
<i>I'm picking up some
voices or something.</i>

176
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,647
I'm sure you're picking up
pirate or maraudic chatter.

177
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:43,443
Nothing to be alarmed about.

178
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,779
Probably echoes from last
night's attack on our freighters.

179
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,845
<i>Those signals will be
bouncing around all week.</i>

180
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:52,224
Yes sir. I mean, no sir.
This isn't an echo, sir.

181
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:55,911
It's a voice. A strong voice.
It's singing.

182
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,271
- Singing?
- Yes.

183
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:02,559
- Delta sector, did you say "singing"?
- Yes.

184
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:06,366
Operational control, this is
Supervisor 14 on the floor.

185
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,936
Feed me to Delta sector.

186
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:27,164
Come in, Houston Control.
Come in.

187
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,892
<i>Houston Control, this is Flight 711.</i>

188
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:31,737
<i>Come on you guys. You read me?
Give me some instructions.</i>

189
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:33,375
<i>I'm on final reentry.</i>

190
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,097
<i>Come in, Houston Control.
Houston Control, do you read me?</i>

191
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:43,222
<i>Hey! Come on you turkeys, get off
your duff and give me some info.</i>

192
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:45,120
It's practically a foreign language.

193
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,232
Maybe some kind of joke?

194
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:01,339
It's heading directly to the
defense shield. Get me Intercept.

195
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,015
<i>Intercept squadron
on the line, please.</i>

196
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:17,073
Colonel Deering.
What are the coordinates?

197
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:24,560
Right. We're targeting the shield
100 miles to identify the craft.

198
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:31,373
Alert, Intercept airborned.
Position of alien craft.

199
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,239
- Very odd.
- What's odd?

200
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:41,975
The target seems to be
moving unusually slow

201
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,378
and erratic for any
conventional spacecraft.

202
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,884
I have target in visual sight.

203
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,213
What is it?

204
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,752
Hey, alright.
I see you...

205
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:15,385
guys.

206
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,032
Who are you?

207
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,313
What are you?

208
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:26,690
Attention, alien spacecraft.
Do you read?

209
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,782
Why do call an "alien"? You don't
look so familiar yourself, you know.

210
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:30,922
<i>Who are you?</i>

211
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:34,204
Please restrict your answers to "yes"
or "no". You're in grave danger.

212
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,602
From who?
You?

213
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:38,261
You are traversing a narrow
corridor into our inner cities.

214
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,799
Inner what? Look, lady...

215
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,789
Colonel Deering.
Now, please be quiet.

216
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,508
If you deviate from my orders by
so much as a thousand yards...

217
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,140
you will be burned into
vapour, do you understand?

218
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:52,039
Vapours? Yeah yeah, I understand.
What do I do?

219
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,969
- Do you have manual override capabilities?
- Sure.

220
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,253
Then, follow me very closely.

221
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,878
Be right on your tail.

222
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:16,176
Really blow it this time.
Gotta be the Russians.

223
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,112
You're doing just fine.

224
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,010
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm just trying to be friendly.

225
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:28,723
Violating our airspace is an
act of war, not friendship.

226
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,199
Now wait until the guys
at the Cape hear this.

227
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:40,160
Buck Rogers sets down in
the middle of Red Square.

228
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,975
Air Control 1 access.

229
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:10,226
Clear on Corridor 1-0
Able for incoming vessel.

230
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:13,246
Confirmed. Outer barriers
all clear for approach...

231
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:17,364
in the Corridor 1-0 Able
for incoming vessel.

232
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,395
Hey, babe. This is quite a setup.

233
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:43,042
It's Colonel Deering,
Commander of Earth Defenses.

234
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,564
- Then you're in charge of all this?
- That's right.

235
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:48,495
- Now, if there are no more questions...
- Why, Colonel, take it easy.

236
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,034
I'd fly with you anytime.

237
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:55,143
- Take this barbarian in for interrogation.
- What?

238
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,818
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

239
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,857
Wait!

240
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:03,521
What you... What are you doing?
Hey wait!

241
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,390
How do you do, Captain Rogers?

242
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:22,015
My name's Dr. Huer.
And I'm very pleased to meet you.

243
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:23,453
Just what's going on?

244
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,289
Where am I and what
are you doing to me?

245
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,790
Well, we're studying you.
It's all electronic and painless.

246
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,075
But so far we're as boggled
as you are by what happened.

247
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,915
Your testing is producing
the most phenomenal data.

248
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:38,618
Terrific.
But what is happening?

249
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:40,930
Cos if I'm dead, I obviously
didn't make it to heaven.

250
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,430
So just what planet is this?

251
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,430
What planet?
Oh, it's Earth, of course.

252
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:46,966
You returned as your
mission required...

253
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:52,394
to almost the precise landing area
originally programmed into your ship.

254
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,295
Aah, look, Doc.

255
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,084
I've been through a lot...

256
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:02,858
but there is no way
you can tell me that...

257
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:05,346
that city out there is
anything like Chicago.

258
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:08,853
No, it isn't. There's nothing
like Chicago left on Earth.

259
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,080
Allow me to bring in my
administrator, Dr. Theopolis.

260
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,642
Now look, Doc...

261
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,447
Twiki, would you bring
in Dr. Theopolis, please?

262
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,957
- What is that?
- It is Twiki.

263
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,644
- He's your drone.
- My what?

264
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,550
Well, for the duration of your
debriefing and determination...

265
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:39,765
Twiki will act as your aide.

266
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:43,488
And this...
This is Dr. Theopolis.

267
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,376
Good morning, Dr. Theopolis.
Lovely day.

268
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,389
Thank you.
I did my best.

269
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:51,138
Dr. Theopolis here is a
member of our Computer Council.

270
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:53,901
And in addition to other things,
he is personally responsible...

271
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:56,534
for all our environmental controls
here within the Inner City.

272
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,777
This introducing a pale hint of
mauve into the sunset this evening.

273
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,495
Not so deep as an amethyst...

274
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,554
but the more subtle burn
texture of cinnamon.

275
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,239
Well, how nice.

276
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,442
I do hope our captain
can watch it with us.

277
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:10,286
It's truly going to be lovely.

278
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,662
If I were you, I'd check in with
whoever's programming that thing.

279
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,928
Captain Rogers, it is
we on the Council...

280
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:20,100
who do the programming
for the entire city.

281
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,107
And kindly reserve your opinion.
Shall we get down to cases?

282
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:28,962
Captain Rogers, I... I'll leave
you with a word of advice.

283
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,970
These quads are not
programmed by man.

284
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:34,899
They've been programmed by
one another over for generations.

285
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,886
You see, the mistakes we have made...

286
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:40,491
in areas, well, like
our environment...

287
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,642
have been entirely
turned over to them.

288
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:45,010
And they saved the
Earth from certain doom.

289
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:47,663
Little by little, bringing us
back, so that we will not have

290
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:50,824
to depend entirely on other
planets for our food and water.

291
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:53,166
The quads are not human, but...

292
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,048
you can hurt their feelings.

293
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:59,360
It's this sensitivity that
separates them from mere machines.

294
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:04,742
So, I'll see you again in
approximately 16 hours.

295
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:06,889
16 hours?
Wait a minute!

296
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,045
Do you think I'm going to sit here
and talk to a box for 16 hours?

297
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:14,662
Sit down, captain. Let's both try
to be as pleasant as possible.

298
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:18,155
That's a good fellow.

299
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:20,912
Be a good drone, Twiki, and
place me on the table...

300
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,732
where I can get a good
look at the captain

301
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:24,752
while you get him some
liquid refreshment.

302
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,456
Well, that's alright. I don't
need any liquid refreshment.

303
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:29,588
Of course you do.

304
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,309
You're extremely dehydrated
from your ordeal, Buck.

305
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,955
If I may call you Buck.

306
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,041
Now run along Twiki and get
Captain Rogers his drink.

307
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:46,305
Well now...

308
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,808
what an attractive man you
are, Captain Buck Rogers.

309
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:50,899
Now look...

310
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:53,342
I've been waiting 24 hours...

311
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:57,225
to find out where I am,
who I am, who you are.

312
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:58,875
Can I have some answers?

313
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,704
Certainly, Buck. That's why I'm
here, to answer your questions.

314
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:04,313
Great. Let's have it.

315
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:07,598
Well, you are Captain Buck Rogers,
and according to your ship's log...

316
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,623
You left Earth in 1987.

317
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,650
That much I know.
Tell me what I don't know.

318
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,481
Well, if preliminary data holds up,

319
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:18,464
it appears you have returned
to Earth 504 years later.

320
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:24,288
You are now in the 25th century.

321
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:27,762
Buck? Are you alright, Buck?

322
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,426
Did you hear me?

323
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:30,721
Buck?

324
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,076
I think I want a drink now.

325
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:43,323
You can take my word. He's
a wonderful man. Believe me.

326
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,115
I do believe, that you believe
that he's a wonderful man...

327
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:48,418
but you're not being asked
to risk the lives of our few

328
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,368
surviving warriors
on his subterfuge.

329
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:53,813
He is only one man. What can he
possibly do to endanger our people?

330
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,327
He could attempt to discredit
the treaty with Draconia.

331
00:24:56,403 --> 00:25:00,417
But he has made no such attempt.
He comes to us a bewildered man.

332
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:04,087
I would like the opportunity to
spend some time with our captain.

333
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:07,574
If you're hoping to find fault with his
testimony, you'll waste your time.

334
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,729
Saving Earth cannot
be a waste of time...

335
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,097
despite having to endure
the captain's company.

336
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:15,524
Well, if Dr. Theopolis has
no objections... I have none.

337
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,213
I have no objections.

338
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:21,276
And the captain belongs
to me until I expose him.

339
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,330
I have not seen Colonel Deering...

340
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:30,123
so uncharacteristically
emotional about anything before.

341
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:33,378
Nor anyone.

342
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:38,781
This part seems more of
a dream than a nightmare.

343
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,281
Look, I was a little loud yesterday.
I'd like to apologize.

344
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,978
I accept your apology, captain.

345
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:54,392
Tell me about the holocaust.

346
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:56,273
I can't.

347
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,467
Well, until I hear it and feel it.
It isn't real.

348
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:03,718
Look, I lost everything
that was important to me.

349
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,477
A mother, father, brothers,
sisters, a woman I cared for.

350
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,587
And until I hear something
that convinces me different...

351
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:14,257
they're waiting for me right now,
somewhere else in time and space.

352
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,777
- What's it like on the outside?
- Outside the city? You wouldn't like it.

353
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:22,739
- Radiation?
- In some places.

354
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:24,876
Ruins and scorched
earth everywhere else.

355
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:27,440
That's why we're so dependent
on trade with other planets.

356
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:31,272
This trade agreement with the Draconians
and the princess. What's that all about?

357
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:35,118
We're being starved out by pirates
who choke off our shipping lines.

358
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:37,860
The Draconians have promised to
keep our supply lines open...

359
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,945
in return for landing
privileges here on Earth.

360
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:43,151
I'd like to see my ship.
Is that possible?

361
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:46,240
Anything is possible, captain.

362
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:51,253
Those guards thought we were crazy
coming out here at this hour of the night.

363
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:53,475
I've had enough sleep
to last me a lifetime.

364
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:57,112
Do you recognize these markings?

365
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:01,155
Fairly common for an aircraft
that had been in combat.

366
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,205
Well, I wasn't in combat.
Did your ships fire on me?

367
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:06,270
- Certainly not.
- Then who did?

368
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,091
Possibly pirates who've
been attacking our shipping.

369
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:11,382
And why am I still here?
Why didn't they finish me off?

370
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,047
Why didn't they strip the
ship or at least open it?

371
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,447
You'd think pirates would be thorough
enough to check out an unarmed ship...

372
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,426
particularly one they
bothered to fire on.

373
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:24,666
You've been in flight a long time.
Anything could have happened.

374
00:27:24,824 --> 00:27:28,306
Yeah, well those burns are fresh.
The cordite is still unoxidized.

375
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:30,974
I think Princess Ardala's
attack fighters fired on me...

376
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:32,429
before they towed me aboard her ship.

377
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:37,635
- Her ship is unarmed. That is the law.
- Yeah well, she seems to be bending it.

378
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,270
What would you suggest, Captain?

379
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:41,138
I would suggest thoroughly
searching her ship

380
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,218
before you allow it inside
your defense shield.

381
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:47,534
Rather an insulting way to begin
an alliance based on good faith.

382
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:51,198
Good faith is for bureaucrats.
It won't get you a city with a lid on it.

383
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:53,578
I'd go up there armed to
the teeth, full squadron,

384
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,998
otherwise you'll be sitting ducks.

385
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:59,201
For a man whose expertise is
allegedly five centuries old...

386
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:01,139
you seem quite opinionated.

387
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:02,633
You're right.

388
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,758
It's none of my business
how you blow up your world.

389
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:08,075
My generation didn't know
what they were doing either.

390
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:10,184
- Good night, Colonel.
- Where are you going, Captain?

391
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:13,243
- I'm going to look around the city.
- You're suspicion. You can't.

392
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,278
I'd like to find out what's
changed in 500 years.

393
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,325
- That's forbidden.
- It's a free country. At least, it was.

394
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:23,203
Technically you're still under arrest
and my prisoner. I can't let you go.

395
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,032
You'll have to shoot
me to stop me, Colonel.

396
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:26,874
You leave me little choice.

397
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:38,878
You didn't have to
come with me, Theo.

398
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:42,459
I wanted to be with you, Buck.
I wish you'd listened to reasons.

399
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:45,962
This is nothing compared
to what lies ahead.

400
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:48,847
Why don't we stay here for the night?

401
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:51,226
Oh, I'm afraid we'd freeze to death.

402
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:54,042
What little warmth you feel is
emanated from the Inner City.

403
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,086
In a few hours, they cut
power by two thirds...

404
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,506
and it will drop well
below zero out here.

405
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,683
Well, it's straight
ahead then I guess.

406
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:04,678
I'm just sorry I brought
you guys into all this.

407
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,890
I was assigned to be with you.

408
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:10,074
No one forced me into your camp.
I believed in you...

409
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:11,223
and I still do.

410
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,724
- What is he saying?
- You don't want to know.

411
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,682
Oh!

412
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:26,025
- What's he saying now?
- You don't want to know.

413
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:28,546
You guys go back. I can put up
with whatever's out there...

414
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,673
if it helps me to find what
happened to my people.

415
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,413
I'm with you, Buck.

416
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,701
- What's he saying?
- You don't want to know.

417
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:12,491
Stop saying I don't want to know.
I want to know.

418
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,511
He thinks we're being watched.

419
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,529
It's just his imagination.
Come on.

420
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:25,804
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
- Oh we'll be alright.

421
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:34,078
- It isn't you they're after.
- What?

422
00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:35,903
No offense, but it's us.

423
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:39,163
My gold circuits and parts bring a
lot of money on the black market.

424
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,592
As for Twiki, well, I'd hate to
tell you the use they'll put him to.

425
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:45,528
Buck, where are you going?

426
00:30:47,622 --> 00:30:49,122
STATE STREET

427
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:50,857
My God!
This is it.

428
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:59,217
I don't mean to impugn
your strategy, Buck...

429
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:01,700
but standing in the middle
of the street is stupid...

430
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,614
under the circumstance.

431
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:08,536
Come on!

432
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,415
- I don't know where he is going.
- Just follow him.

433
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,872
- I don't know what he's doing.
- Just follow him, Twiki.

434
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,758
- Holy...
- I know, Twiki.

435
00:31:56,903 --> 00:31:59,337
- I see them.
- Just keep going.

436
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:05,787
Don't think thoughts like that.
You'll run down your batteries.

437
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:20,692
This is where my parents are buried.

438
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:22,583
Well, at least I know part of it.

439
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,228
We can't stay long, Buck.
We're being followed.

440
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,217
What happened?

441
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,666
There's only one stone, no date.

442
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:34,333
Only a few fortunate
ones were buried at all.

443
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:37,585
It happened so fast,
families were buried together.

444
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:41,088
Dates became unimportant
as all systems broke down.

445
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,558
Finally, there were no
more armies or fighting.

446
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:47,395
Only starvation, contamination
and lingering death.

447
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:52,433
- I wish I'd been with them.
- You can't go back, Buck.

448
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:56,914
The past is gone. But you can
still help us with our future.

449
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:02,017
If there is a future.
I'm afraid it's too late.

450
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:03,929
Take off, Twiki.

451
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:29,055
Watch out!

452
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:50,061
Dirty...

453
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:29,326
There's just too many of
them, Buck. It's hopeless.

454
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:36,760
If anyone has any last words, I
think now would be the time for them.

455
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,659
Let's get out of here.

456
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:33,968
Oh well, Colonel. What brings
you out on a night like this?

457
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:36,729
Captain, I came to find
you at some personal risk.

458
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,006
- Very ballsy.
- Very what?

459
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:43,748
Forget it. Well, don't
expect any fanfare.

460
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:46,485
We were doing just fine until
you came along. Right, Theo?

461
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,296
- Well...
- Forget it, Theo.

462
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:51,418
Well, at least Twiki is on my side.

463
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,881
Matter of fact,
I kind of like it out here.

464
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,504
It's a bit primitive, but then
it is the south side of Chicago.

465
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,543
Captain, we're wasting time.
Let's go.

466
00:35:57,673 --> 00:35:59,364
I'm not through looking yet.

467
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,146
So unless you're
prepared to shoot me...

468
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,942
Captain, you got away once,
but not this time. Lieutenant.

469
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:10,643
What's wrong?

470
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:17,306
Then it's true, he's
working for the pirates.

471
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:19,154
I still don't believe it.

472
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:21,174
Well, you stand alone, Theo.

473
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:24,152
The micro-transmitter was attached
to his navigational equipment...

474
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,857
revealing our secret access
corridors to our enemies.

475
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,948
That's not the behaviour
of an innocent man.

476
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:32,359
At first I thought he
was guilty and then...

477
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,591
You're being subjective in
your evaluation of Buck Rogers.

478
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:39,122
I, on the other hand, support
him for very practical reasons.

479
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,978
- And what are they?
- I'm convinced of one thing.

480
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:45,426
Our friend, Captain Rogers, has
indeed met the Princess Ardala...

481
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,850
and has been aboard
the draconian flagship.

482
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,870
His descriptions are too precise...

483
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,455
to be the guesswork of a pirate.

484
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:55,126
Perhaps the pirates have been aboard her
ship and provided him with the information.

485
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:57,694
My dear, they are the
deadliest of enemies.

486
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,997
It is unlikely that any pirate could
survive such a visit to tell about it.

487
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,534
Word from Earth on Captain Rogers' fate.

488
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,853
His ship was intercepted and led down...

489
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:26,937
as I expected.

490
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:32,946
Did the transmitter we sneaked aboard his
ship provide the necessary information...

491
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,495
to bring my father's forces
through their defense shield?

492
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:38,332
Yes, however the transmitter
had been discovered.

493
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:40,499
- It's too bad.
- It makes no difference.

494
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,257
Once we're welcomed inside, we
will destroy the shield from within.

495
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,307
Won't the earthlings
be suspicious when.

496
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:49,429
Captain Rogers tells them
he was aboard our ship?

497
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,281
They won't believe him.
Captain Rogers is as good as dead.

498
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:57,347
Now stop worrying about the trial.

499
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:01,428
I'm a member of the Council and
I'm going to defend you personally.

500
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:05,274
Thanks, Theo. It's nice to
have at least one friend.

501
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:09,698
I'm sorry, Twiki.
Two friends.

502
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:13,078
The Computer Council is ready
to hear the final arguments...

503
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,879
in the case of the Directorate
versus Captain Buck Rogers...

504
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,392
on charges of espionage and treason.

505
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:22,016
- Councilor Apol.
- The State's is elementary.

506
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:25,175
Captain Rogers piloted a foreign
aircraft through our defense network...

507
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:29,194
with a micro-transmitter, revealing our
secret shield borders to our enemy.

508
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,775
What price you may ask...

509
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,621
What bounty would
Captain Rogers consider

510
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:36,642
just in selling out the human race?

511
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:38,904
Only he and his pirate
friends can answer.

512
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:41,263
But I submit that in my opinion...

513
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:45,338
it is the destruction of the treaty with
Draconia that they seek at all cost.

514
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:48,063
For its enactment spells their doom.

515
00:38:48,511 --> 00:38:50,506
The State rests its case.

516
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:53,908
We will now hear from the defense.
Dr. Theopolis.

517
00:38:57,038 --> 00:39:00,205
Distinguished colleagues,
you have heard the evidence...

518
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,074
and I challenge you
to find this man guilty.

519
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:07,519
No evidence has been found to suggest
his claim to a birthright on this planet...

520
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,867
because we all know full well...

521
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:13,100
no records exist prior
to the great holocaust.

522
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:16,471
He has no explanation as how a
transmitter got aboard his ship...

523
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,544
because it was not his doing.

524
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:21,953
He is an innocent pawn in a great war.

525
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:25,938
I say to you, my colleagues,
that if you find this man guilty...

526
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:27,904
you must find me guilty.

527
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:31,845
My sensors tell me
that this man is good.

528
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:35,301
The defense rests.
Thank you.

529
00:39:35,714 --> 00:39:39,869
Captain Rogers, have you any last
words before we pass judgment?

530
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:49,333
Just that I'm an innocent pawn,
puppet, call it what you will.

531
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,184
Somebody else pulls the strings.

532
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,953
You'd be better advised to worry
less about me and more about them.

533
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:59,325
Because I can do you no more harm,
no matter what the outcome today.

534
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:03,098
But he or she...

535
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,028
could destroy you.

536
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,104
Very nice, Buck. We don't
have a thing to worry about.

537
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:19,556
By unanimous vote, the
Council finds for the State.

538
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:23,751
Captain Rogers, the
Council finds you guilty.

539
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:26,444
Your life is to be terminated.

540
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:29,750
Said termination will be
carried out immediately.

541
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:32,680
This council is adjourned.

542
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:35,495
I don't believe it.

543
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,458
Aren't you going to say anything?

544
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,930
- No.
- That's ridiculous.

545
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:55,614
You have been
sentenced for termination.

546
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:59,981
At the very least, I would think a man
of your sort would fly into a rage...

547
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,709
Lash out at me.
Say something.

548
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:04,433
Goodbye?

549
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,645
Buck, stop it!
You're being unreasonable.

550
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:08,688
I'm being unreasonable?

551
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:15,386
It is almost as if you don't think
the sentence will be carried out.

552
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,527
Well, as a matter of fact,
I don't think there's going

553
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:19,484
to be anyone around to
carry the sentence out.

554
00:41:19,795 --> 00:41:21,553
At least I know you
people won't be in charge.

555
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:25,170
You're still clinging to your story
about the Draconia bearing arms.

556
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,029
I can prove it.

557
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:30,445
What would you say if I told you...

558
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:33,508
that I came here to
give you that chance?

559
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,246
How?

560
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:41,448
By flying out to meet the Draconia
flagship, to verify your story...

561
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,933
about them finding you.

562
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:46,716
And... do a little looking
around while you're there?

563
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:48,204
Exactly.

564
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,232
No no. I...
I don't like that plan.

565
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:58,329
- It worries me.
- Why?

566
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,164
Well, you see, I'm
scheduled for termination.

567
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,765
If I miss it, I might get
into a lot of trouble.

568
00:42:04,012 --> 00:42:04,999
Buck! You are impossible.

569
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:07,702
I'm offering you your life and
you're giving me practical jokes?

570
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:09,009
Well, you see that's the point.

571
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:12,525
Are you offering me
termination of my termination...

572
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:14,330
or are you just postponing it?

573
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:19,150
If you can prove that
your story is true...

574
00:42:22,778 --> 00:42:23,949
Let's go.

575
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:38,279
Stay close to my wing, Captain. We'll
keep the maneuvers nice and simple.

576
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:41,649
Stay on auto-flight. You won't be
expected to run anything but the throttle.

577
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:42,947
Thanks, colonel.

578
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:46,232
Is it alright if I occasionally
look out the window? Hmm?

579
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,041
This is no time for levity, Captain.

580
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:50,770
We've lost nearly a third of our
ships in this sector to pirates.

581
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:52,876
When they hit, they hit fast.

582
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:54,506
You can't out-fly the computer.

583
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:57,439
It will take any necessary evasive
action to avoid their missiles.

584
00:42:57,753 --> 00:43:00,716
If you try to fly that thing,
you will only cost us a ship.

585
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,614
I appreciate your concern.

586
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,920
Just wish I had brought
along something to read.

587
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:08,253
I make a target vector 401.

588
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,991
Roger, Colonel. I have a
visual on target. Just to port.

589
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:13,077
If you have visual at this distance...

590
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:14,779
it must be gigantic.

591
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,033
Permission to come aboard?
Why?

592
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,189
A special envoy.

593
00:43:30,227 --> 00:43:31,391
That's all I know.

594
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,239
It isn't according to protocol.

595
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:38,090
- What do you think they have in mind?
- I don't know.

596
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:40,276
But they have given us plenty of warning.

597
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,666
And there'll be nothing
in evidence to betray us.

598
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:45,247
I'll be curious to know
what they have in mind.

599
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:48,200
Let's prepare a very
special welcome for them.

600
00:43:50,615 --> 00:43:52,611
Send out our pirate ships...

601
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:55,028
and arrange a little
surprise for them.

602
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:09,233
Welcome aboard the
flagship Draconia...

603
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:12,269
envoy of Draco, conqueror of space...

604
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:16,479
warlord of Astrium, ruler
of the Draconian realm.

605
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,052
I give you his daughter,
Princess Ardala.

606
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:22,986
Delighted.
This is an unexpected pleasure.

607
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:25,186
We are hardly prepared
to greet you properly.

608
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,475
Consider your time adequate greeting.

609
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:31,235
I'm Colonel Deering, Commander of the
3rd Force of the Earth Directorate.

610
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:33,789
And I believe you already
know Captain Rogers.

611
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:37,738
But no. If I had met so
dashing young captain...

612
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:39,811
I'm sure I would have
remembered vividly.

613
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,884
I don't believe we've
had the pleasure.

614
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:45,405
I think you're mistaken, princess.

615
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,241
I never forget a knuckle.

616
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:50,814
Captain!

617
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:52,835
Listen. We're here to get
to the bottom of things.

618
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:57,030
Would you like me to describe
some of your inner chambers?

619
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,740
Oh! What inner chambers
is he referring?

620
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:03,616
Well the princess may not find me
memorable, but I'll never forget her.

621
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:06,185
I especially liked the dress
with the high neck collar and...

622
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:08,768
Colonel Deering,
what is this all about?

623
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,083
Why are you here?

624
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:13,111
The pirate forces are at
their worst in this sector.

625
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,290
We brought our ships to
assure you safe arrival.

626
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:26,132
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

627
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,913
<i>Draconia under attack
by hostile ships.</i>

628
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:30,038
And Captain Rogers...

629
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,448
All personnel to defense posts.

630
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:36,978
- Men, to your ships!
- Alert all stations. Secure the ship.

631
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,826
So this is how you
bid us safe conduct.

632
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:43,096
Find escort.
At least we'll all perish together.

633
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:52,604
<i>Clear all launch channels for attack.</i>

634
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:54,167
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

635
00:46:41,263 --> 00:46:43,346
Lay off, Bank! I got your tail.

636
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,016
Pull up! I'll cut him off.

637
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,706
There's no way you're diving
without any of those powers!

638
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,491
Captain Rogers, I ordered
you to stay out of this.

639
00:46:57,718 --> 00:46:59,294
Colonel, you need all
the help you can get.

640
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:06,397
- Wing man! Man at 12 o'clock high.
- 12 o'clock what?

641
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:11,406
Lieutenant Wrather, disregard.
Captain Rogers, get off the air.

642
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:13,369
Our combat computers
are way ahead of you.

643
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:16,307
Well yeah Colonel, but if your computers
don't do something pretty fast...

644
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:18,880
your lieutenant Wrather
is going to be...

645
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:24,279
Watch out, Thornberry!

646
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:29,461
Colonel, you've got to
go to manual flight.

647
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:31,874
Buck Rogers, if you don't
stop distracting our pilots...

648
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:34,978
You just have a lieutenant and
a couple of pirates on your tail.

649
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:38,839
Colonel, I'm switching to manual.

650
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,019
See if I can start dishing out a
little of what we've been taking.

651
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:44,081
Buck Rogers, I'm ordering
you back to the base.

652
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:51,726
Nailed him... let's see how he like
a little old fashion red dogging.

653
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:13,191
One sack. Six to go.

654
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:20,610
Got you!

655
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,857
Colonel. Take it down.
Straight down and enter retro!

656
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,883
I can't! It goes against the
principles of modern aerial combat.

657
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:56,800
That's called bunching
your linebackers.

658
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:06,834
Look! I don't know what went wrong
with our combat computers but...

659
00:49:07,755 --> 00:49:08,825
thank you.

660
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:12,023
Now, captain, let's go home.

661
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:16,236
- Mine or is it yours?
- What?

662
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:18,041
- What did you say?
- Just joking.

663
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,111
Air control 1 to access.

664
00:49:20,284 --> 00:49:24,199
Clear on Corridor 1-0
Able for incoming vessel.

665
00:49:27,287 --> 00:49:30,043
Confirmed. Outer barrier is
all clear for approach...

666
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:33,959
on Corridor 1-0 Able
for incoming vessel.

667
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:43,197
Colonel Deering. Have
you seen Captain Rogers?

668
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:44,506
Yes. Why?

669
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,517
Our Council has had a formal request
from Her Majesty Princess Ardala.

670
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,161
What has that got to
do with the captain?

671
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:53,343
Well, the princess feels
he single-handedly saved...

672
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:55,524
their unarmed vessel from
the renegade pirates...

673
00:49:55,545 --> 00:49:57,378
and wants to thank him personally.

674
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:58,789
Single-handedly?

675
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,849
Apparently, even your
ship was nearly destroyed.

676
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:04,369
Were if not for Captain
Rogers' inordinate skills...

677
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,437
and quick thinking,
the princess feels...

678
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,318
I don't care what the princess feels.

679
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:10,394
I know what happened.
I was there.

680
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,029
Tomorrow I conquer Earth.

681
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:20,917
Tomorrow we conquer
Earth, your Highness.

682
00:50:44,823 --> 00:50:46,740
You look magnificent, Buck.

683
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,877
Is something troubling you?

684
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,550
Why am I invited to this thing?
Nobody believes me.

685
00:50:52,775 --> 00:50:54,987
Princess Ardala wants
to thank you personally

686
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:56,754
for fighting the
pirates off her ship.

687
00:50:57,653 --> 00:51:00,735
And I'd had a word or two
with her myself... alone.

688
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:02,728
Oh! I'm sure that won't be permitted.

689
00:51:02,881 --> 00:51:05,271
After all, you're only a captain.

690
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,503
And not even commissioned at that.

691
00:51:08,968 --> 00:51:11,739
- What have you got for headache?
- A headache? Are you ill, Buck?

692
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:14,349
Oh! I guess I'm just not fully
recovered from that long trip yet.

693
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:18,236
Why didn't you say something?
Twiki will get you a relaxant.

694
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,244
Well, it's time to go in now.

695
00:51:21,265 --> 00:51:23,734
We don't want to keep the
trade delegation waiting.

696
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:48,123
Welcome.
The Draconian trade delegation...

697
00:51:48,144 --> 00:51:50,127
under the leadership of
Her Royal Highness...

698
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,041
Crown Princess of the realm.
Ardala.

699
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:58,919
I bring you greetings on
this historic occasion.

700
00:51:59,971 --> 00:52:01,730
My father, King Draco...

701
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:05,153
would like to present to you
his own flagship Draconia...

702
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,467
filled with all the latest technology...

703
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:10,176
as a gift to symbolize
a new glorious era...

704
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:12,492
of commerce and peace.

705
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:18,361
Let the celebration begin.

706
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:36,378
- We brought you some pills, Buck.
- Hmm?

707
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:40,270
For your headache.
It's a very strong relaxant.

708
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:42,690
You mustn't take more
than one at a time.

709
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:44,469
Thanks guys.

710
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:48,436
Well, I see dancing has come
a long way in 500 years.

711
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,966
Listen. I'm going to need
something else. A rose.

712
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,995
- Did you say a rose?
- Yeah, a red one.

713
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:05,260
What do you need a rose for, Buck?

714
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,959
Twiki, would you go get
me one, quickly huh?

715
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:20,398
How do you like our
presentation, Captain Rogers?

716
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,897
Most impressive.

717
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:27,335
Did this folk dance come all
the way from her daddy's world?

718
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:31,162
Sorry, I don't think I
understand your terms.

719
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:35,142
And I would suggest a more
respectful reference than "daddy".

720
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,023
He's perhaps the greatest
leader the world has ever known.

721
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:40,299
Well, a word of caution, Colonel.

722
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:44,834
- Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.
- Greeks?

723
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:48,792
Maybe that was a little before
your time. Quite a while back.

724
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:52,446
Tell me, do you know the
story of the Trojan horse?

725
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:54,848
No.

726
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,244
No, huh?
Well, forget it.

727
00:53:57,389 --> 00:53:59,856
I guess I came from a time
that was hopelessly paranoid.

728
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:01,309
See you around.

729
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:08,677
Your rose, Buck.

730
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:10,697
Oh! It's a nice one.
Thank you, Twiki.

731
00:54:11,295 --> 00:54:14,169
Buck, no one else is giving
the princess flowers.

732
00:54:14,253 --> 00:54:15,996
You're going to make
them all look ridiculous.

733
00:54:16,017 --> 00:54:17,805
Stay close fellows. We're next.

734
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,627
Well, Captain Rogers.
Congratulations and thank you.

735
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:33,457
We're very grateful to you for saving
us from those horrible privateers.

736
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:36,661
Not too loud, my Princess.

737
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:39,647
Around here they think
I am a privateer. Thanks to you.

738
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,552
Me? Well, I hope I haven't
caused you too much embarrassment.

739
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,627
- Are you angry?
- On behalf of the...

740
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:48,874
- Theo!
- What a body.

741
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:54,777
- From me to you.
- Who's your charming little friend?

742
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,531
His name is Twiki.

743
00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:59,743
Yes, and that thing hanging
around his neck is Theo...

744
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:02,026
Ex-officio member of
the Computer Council.

745
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,237
Your Majesty.

746
00:55:03,257 --> 00:55:04,769
Would you care to join
me in the next dance?

747
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:08,465
- The princess does not...
- Does not mind to dance.

748
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,003
I don't think I'm too up on
these latest dance steps.

749
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,378
Well, if you have a preference...
It is my party.

750
00:55:41,492 --> 00:55:43,378
Really. How about something
old-fashioned, huh?

751
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:47,958
Sir, excuse me. Are you
familiar with... rock? You know...

752
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:50,667
Try it, try it. Come on.

753
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:56,309
No, no, that's not it.
Just let yourself go.

754
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:57,986
Let it go. Go with the music.

755
00:55:58,243 --> 00:55:59,243
That's right. Yeah.

756
00:56:09,942 --> 00:56:10,911
What are you doing?

757
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:14,296
It's called getting down. It's a little
before your time, if it frightens you...

758
00:56:16,484 --> 00:56:17,831
Nothing frightens me.

759
00:56:17,952 --> 00:56:20,159
Yeah it's fine.
Get down and boogie.

760
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:45,633
It's expressive.

761
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,828
It's disgusting!

762
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:53,657
- What happens if we bump together?
- We automatically become man and wife.

763
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:57,163
Groovy. Get down.

764
00:56:58,762 --> 00:57:00,723
You're quite a man, Captain Rogers.

765
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,596
I have the feeling the earth people
believe your incredible story...

766
00:57:03,617 --> 00:57:06,111
about being frozen for 500 years.

767
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,949
- Not on your life. They think I'm a spy.
- One of mine?

768
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:13,609
- They're not sure.
- You want to join us?

769
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:17,195
- Who do I gotta see to make my move?
- Me.

770
00:57:18,044 --> 00:57:21,927
Tell me, that building... Is it
still the communications center?

771
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:25,198
That would be secret information.

772
00:57:25,948 --> 00:57:27,113
Of course.

773
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,956
I will always be one of you, Dr. Huer.

774
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:34,217
Perhaps I will remain
here... permanently.

775
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:35,830
We hope so.

776
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:56,288
Your Highness, some of ministers
would like a few minutes.

777
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:59,770
- Later, Kane.
- Business of the realm comes first!

778
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:03,544
Your father expects you to serve
the best interests of the realm.

779
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,119
If you don't...

780
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:08,634
he has 29 other daughters that will!

781
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:20,032
It's been a pleasure, Captain Rogers, but
I'm afraid our duties are cut out for us.

782
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:23,180
Later perhaps?

783
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,489
I depart aboard my
private launch at midnight.

784
00:58:27,946 --> 00:58:29,169
I'll be there.

785
00:58:35,463 --> 00:58:37,034
Captain Rogers.

786
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,623
I wonder if this wouldn't be
a good time to talk with you.

787
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:43,622
Princess Ardala left so abruptly...

788
00:58:43,643 --> 00:58:45,648
and the party seems to be over.

789
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:47,944
You don't have any plans, do you?

790
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,503
- Well...
- Good.

791
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,248
I have something I would like to say.

792
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:54,425
Well, I...

793
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:56,974
I thought you were a
spy, Captain Rogers.

794
00:58:59,224 --> 00:59:00,644
I was wrong.

795
00:59:23,302 --> 00:59:25,513
Would you like to go some place?

796
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:29,618
I'm not up to that yet.

797
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:32,360
I have been out of it
for quite a while...

798
00:59:33,627 --> 00:59:34,662
500 years.

799
00:59:34,907 --> 00:59:37,315
I've got to go easy on reentry.

800
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:58,804
It's alright.

801
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:01,358
Now listen to her, fella.
She's making sense.

802
01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:03,967
I've asked Captain Rogers to join us.

803
01:00:05,391 --> 01:00:06,925
Lucky for you she called me on.

804
01:00:18,946 --> 01:00:20,550
We're almost there.

805
01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:22,660
Where are you going?

806
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:26,314
I know it's chilly, but
we've got no choice.

807
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:28,725
Our orders are to stay close to Buck.

808
01:00:29,024 --> 01:00:31,816
And he may need us,
so back in the cooler.

809
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:36,353
Twiki, I'm speaking to you.

810
01:00:37,005 --> 01:00:39,369
Ooh! Freezing my ball bearings off.

811
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,356
Captain Rogers is
just not to be found.

812
01:00:46,738 --> 01:00:48,664
What do you expect from a primitive?

813
01:00:49,597 --> 01:00:50,860
We'll let you know
if we hear anything.

814
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,966
You are a spy, Buck Rogers...

815
01:00:56,723 --> 01:00:59,010
and I know exactly where you are.

816
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,373
Out!

817
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,501
They make better pets
if you had them fixed.

818
01:01:22,337 --> 01:01:24,836
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
Pour us a drink.

819
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,413
At last we're alone.

820
01:01:54,763 --> 01:01:56,141
Have you nothing to say?

821
01:01:57,223 --> 01:01:59,513
Up until this moment I didn't
know what it was I'd been missing.

822
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,890
Well, I have a confession as well.

823
01:02:02,187 --> 01:02:03,772
There's somebody else back home.

824
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:06,813
I didn't realized what I was missing.

825
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,156
You're different.

826
01:02:10,356 --> 01:02:11,514
You're arrogant.

827
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:13,751
You flagrantly disregard orders.

828
01:02:14,509 --> 01:02:16,756
And you're the kind of man
who could unseat my father.

829
01:02:16,878 --> 01:02:19,387
Your father's seat is the
furthest thing from my mind.

830
01:02:19,979 --> 01:02:21,655
I brought you here for a reason.

831
01:02:21,873 --> 01:02:22,983
I was counting on that.

832
01:02:24,265 --> 01:02:25,647
I want you by my side.

833
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:28,137
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

834
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:30,762
Consider it.

835
01:02:31,301 --> 01:02:35,043
You have no idea what it's like being
the daughter of Draco the Conqueror.

836
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:38,055
29 sisters living at your heels.

837
01:02:40,058 --> 01:02:42,932
Weasely little courtiers
like Kane vying for power.

838
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:47,756
But with a man...
a real man like yourself...

839
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,290
I could defy my father,
I could live my own life.

840
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:54,688
Oh?

841
01:02:55,153 --> 01:02:56,708
A magnificent new dynasty.

842
01:02:56,895 --> 01:02:58,551
Aren't we getting a
little ahead of ourselves?

843
01:02:59,186 --> 01:03:00,594
I'll take that drink now.

844
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:16,223
We have to be very careful.

845
01:03:16,562 --> 01:03:17,826
- Do we?
- Mm hm.

846
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:20,587
The timing is not good.

847
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,938
Things never change.
This is the way it's always been.

848
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:27,710
Why couldn't I have met
you sooner, Buck Rogers?

849
01:03:27,825 --> 01:03:29,484
Well, we've got plenty
of time, don't we?

850
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:42,103
All armament personnel report to
flight bay to begin loading weaponry.

851
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:44,352
Look at them.
Down there sleeping.

852
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:47,065
The fools will never
know what happened.

853
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,538
I so relaxed.
Would you turn off the lights?

854
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,701
If you're a spy,
I'll have to kill you.

855
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:15,034
If that's an example of your best
pillow-talk, I think I found your problem.

856
01:04:31,547 --> 01:04:33,034
This is no good, Twiki.

857
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:35,330
There are soldiers everywhere...

858
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:38,419
and we don't even know where to
begin to look for Captain Rogers.

859
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:15,341
Holy gee!

860
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,649
Let's see if we can
find your jammies now.

861
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:44,228
The pirate ships. So that's how
they were able to attack us.

862
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:45,934
It was their own people.

863
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,441
- Where's Tiger Man?
- I don't know, sir.

864
01:06:34,162 --> 01:06:35,578
Go away!

865
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:41,943
Did they wake you, my darling?

866
01:06:43,058 --> 01:06:45,910
Did they wake you,
my little baby prince?

867
01:06:47,928 --> 01:06:49,043
Blast it!

868
01:06:51,827 --> 01:06:54,936
Get it out! Get it out!
Get it out! Execute him!

869
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:59,369
- No. Remove him for questioning.
- You countermand my order?

870
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:01,437
Under the circumstances, yes.

871
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:03,366
Do as I say.

872
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,390
Take him.

873
01:07:16,049 --> 01:07:17,737
You have a lot of explaining to do.

874
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:19,733
I have some explaining to do?

875
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:22,534
Well, it's not Gucci,
but what the hell!

876
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,533
I don't want to get caught either.

877
01:07:33,892 --> 01:07:37,073
But something is very wrong and
we've got to find out what it is.

878
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:41,396
I hope you know this
violates my warranty.

879
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:45,373
You have quite obviously
been... preoccupied.

880
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,411
I will deal with you for
your insolence later.

881
01:07:48,453 --> 01:07:50,503
Give the order to attack at once.

882
01:07:50,684 --> 01:07:53,830
We cannot attack without your
father's forces to support us.

883
01:07:54,092 --> 01:07:55,857
Kane, you're spineless!

884
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:59,901
We do not need my father.
We have the element of surprise.

885
01:07:59,939 --> 01:08:03,314
We can wipe out the Inner City.
We can destroy the defense shield.

886
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,529
By the time my
father's forces arrive...

887
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,512
we'll be sitting on the
throne of the Earth.

888
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:10,741
At least I will, since you
obviously don't have the nerve.

889
01:08:13,408 --> 01:08:16,742
Alright, we will attack.

890
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:19,468
A wise decision, Kane.

891
01:08:20,135 --> 01:08:23,867
Meanwhile, Captain Rogers is
loose somewhere on this ship.

892
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:25,107
Find him.

893
01:08:26,175 --> 01:08:28,124
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

894
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:32,690
<i>Outside intruder aboard ship.</i>

895
01:08:32,711 --> 01:08:35,499
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

896
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,281
It's Buck.

897
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:42,167
I see him. He's wearing
the uniform of the enemy.

898
01:08:48,242 --> 01:08:50,450
Well, this will warm your tail.

899
01:08:54,721 --> 01:08:58,708
Those are warships out there.
That means the treaty is a hoax.

900
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:01,471
But we can do one last
service for our country.

901
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:04,822
We can deal with Captain Rogers.

902
01:09:07,331 --> 01:09:10,206
Six minutes to attack and counting.

903
01:09:23,647 --> 01:09:26,554
Five minutes to attack and counting.

904
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,484
- Don't move, Captain Rogers.
- Theo, Twiki, what are you doing here?

905
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:33,793
This isn't going to be
pleasant for anyone.

906
01:09:33,813 --> 01:09:35,945
Will you guy get out of here?
I got work to do.

907
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,570
- We can see that, you traitor.
- Can't you see what's happening?

908
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,355
I'd say someone is
about to bomb Earth.

909
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:43,553
Do you recognize these ships?

910
01:09:43,574 --> 01:09:45,348
No, but I don't see how
that's very important...

911
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:46,666
They're pirate ships.

912
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:49,875
Why would there be pirate ships
aboard the Draconian flagship?

913
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,530
I'm sorry. You'll have to do better
than that. Now come with us.

914
01:09:53,551 --> 01:09:55,432
- 4 minutes to attack and counting.
- No.

915
01:09:55,453 --> 01:09:58,206
Look! You half baked load
of electronic gibberish,

916
01:09:58,226 --> 01:09:59,480
I don't expect you
to know everything...

917
01:09:59,501 --> 01:10:02,358
but have you ever heard of loading
bombs into the tail pipe of a rocket ship?

918
01:10:03,469 --> 01:10:06,422
You be quiet, Twiki.
I'm getting confused.

919
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,276
Maybe I can help unconfuse you.

920
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:10,184
There are no pirate ships.
There never were.

921
01:10:10,559 --> 01:10:12,928
They are Draconian bombers
disguised as marauders.

922
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,508
They've been harassing
your shipping lanes

923
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:16,627
in order to force you into
a treaty with Draconia.

924
01:10:17,892 --> 01:10:20,267
Of course!
It's ingenious, if true.

925
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:22,445
<i>Three minutes to attack and counting.</i>

926
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:25,461
You got about 10 seconds to make up your
mind who you believe in. Me or Kane.

927
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:27,982
- Some choice.
- And what about yourself?

928
01:10:28,455 --> 01:10:29,962
Don't your circuits tell
you, I'm on the level?

929
01:10:29,983 --> 01:10:30,742
Yes.

930
01:10:30,763 --> 01:10:32,869
Alright, unless you want to consider
yourself somebody's spare parts,

931
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,524
why don't you go along
with your initial instincts.

932
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:38,543
Alright. But only on the condition
you help us get to a communicator...

933
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:40,769
so we can warn Inner City.

934
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:42,610
Well, you have to
do that on your own.

935
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:44,052
On the chance that
if you don't make it,

936
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,901
I got to make sure none of
these ships are ready to launch.

937
01:10:46,011 --> 01:10:48,986
Commander Kane. I found a
guard unconscious in Bay 3.

938
01:10:50,353 --> 01:10:53,176
- 2 minutes to attack and counting.
- Find somewhere to hide, Theo.

939
01:10:53,197 --> 01:10:54,984
They found the guard I knocked out.
Now get out of here.

940
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:57,930
Alright. Alright. We'll do our part.
Good luck, Buck.

941
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,905
Take me over to the console, Twiki.

942
01:11:19,626 --> 01:11:21,842
Now, grab the middle panel.

943
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:25,691
- Ninety seconds to attack and counting.
- Drop it.

944
01:11:26,635 --> 01:11:28,900
Grab the circuits and pull them.

945
01:11:37,015 --> 01:11:40,140
<i>80 seconds to attack and counting.</i>

946
01:11:43,586 --> 01:11:46,461
<i>70 seconds to attack and counting.</i>

947
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:53,448
Put it close to the microphone.

948
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:55,862
<i>60 seconds to attack and counting.</i>

949
01:11:56,097 --> 01:11:58,219
Earth Directorate, emergency channel.

950
01:11:58,734 --> 01:11:59,972
Come in, please.

951
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,013
Colonel Deering online.

952
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:05,362
This is Dr. Theopolis.

953
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:06,499
Yes doctor.
Where are you?

954
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,264
How did you get on
this emergency channel?

955
01:12:08,285 --> 01:12:10,377
I'm on board the flagship Draconia.

956
01:12:10,514 --> 01:12:13,611
I followed Captain Rogers as ordered.
Now please listen.

957
01:12:13,777 --> 01:12:17,092
The Draconia is not... repeat,
not an unarmed vessel.

958
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:19,081
She is filled with bombers
preparing to launch...

959
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,799
a full-scale military attack
against the Inner City.

960
01:12:22,191 --> 01:12:24,758
But how? Where did they come from?
Their landing bay was empty.

961
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:27,318
Scramble your fighter squadrons now!
At once!

962
01:12:27,474 --> 01:12:29,163
Thank you Doctor.
Good luck.

963
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:31,893
Dr. Huer, permission
to scramble fighters.

964
01:12:36,838 --> 01:12:39,699
<i>20 seconds to attack and counting.</i>

965
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:42,942
Battle stations.

966
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:49,765
Fighters! Prepare to launch!

967
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:56,259
- 10 seconds to attack and counting.
- Standby to attack.

968
01:12:56,778 --> 01:12:59,843
Eight, seven, six...

969
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,264
five seconds to launch.

970
01:13:02,413 --> 01:13:04,557
Four, three...

971
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:06,903
two, one.

972
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:08,214
Attack!

973
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,650
What is it?
What's going on?

974
01:13:26,414 --> 01:13:29,417
- Our ships. They simply exploded.
- That's impossible!

975
01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:43,957
This is Earth Directorate.

976
01:13:43,978 --> 01:13:46,562
Attack bombers as they launch.
We'll attack the main ship.

977
01:13:49,147 --> 01:13:52,007
There are no bombers to attack.
They're exploding as they emerge.

978
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:53,789
That doesn't makes any sense.

979
01:13:55,485 --> 01:13:56,831
Get our warships out there!

980
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:09,162
Prepare to intercept. Do not, I repeat,
do not use combat computers.

981
01:14:09,249 --> 01:14:10,249
Disengaging.

982
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:15,351
Draconia on your wing.
Bank right! I'll get him!

983
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:37,671
We got two coming up from below.
I'll jump the one on the top.

984
01:14:40,923 --> 01:14:42,054
I've got the other one.

985
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,168
Take that and that!

986
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:22,878
Oh, shit!

987
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:36,810
Alright! I'm going to hold you responsible
for any damage done to this bay.

988
01:15:58,907 --> 01:16:00,740
I'm really sorry it
had to come to this.

989
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:09,678
Bottoms up!

990
01:16:12,258 --> 01:16:15,482
Prepare to transmit
Person-Image of King Draco.

991
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,313
What, in the name of
the realm, is going on?

992
01:16:19,395 --> 01:16:23,260
You are attacking while
my ships are still hours away?

993
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,678
I'm... just following orders.

994
01:16:25,863 --> 01:16:29,190
And just whose orders
were you following?

995
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:30,998
Your daughter, sir.

996
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:35,643
And did she order our ships to
disintegrate as they enter battle?

997
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:40,400
If either of you survive this
greatest debacle our realm has known...

998
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:43,500
You will answer to me!

999
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:50,157
All squadron, disengage
from fighting warships,

1000
01:16:50,178 --> 01:16:52,137
and prepare to finish
off the mother-craft.

1001
01:17:06,603 --> 01:17:08,098
<i>Emergency!</i>

1002
01:17:10,307 --> 01:17:13,178
<i>Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1003
01:17:13,249 --> 01:17:15,682
This was your doing, your Highness.

1004
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:19,685
I oughta leave you here to
burn up with the ship...

1005
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,712
But I want you alive to
answer to your father.

1006
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:25,655
I have an emergency escape
shuttle, ready to leave now.

1007
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:30,215
It'll take us far enough away
to reach your father's ship.

1008
01:17:33,102 --> 01:17:36,727
<i>Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1009
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:47,548
<i>Emergency!</i>

1010
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:52,799
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1011
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:57,547
The ship is ready to blow.

1012
01:17:57,825 --> 01:18:01,544
Withdraw all ships from the impact area.
Theo, I'm coming in to get you and Twiki.

1013
01:18:01,565 --> 01:18:03,864
- Forget us. Save Buck.
- Buck?

1014
01:18:03,885 --> 01:18:07,336
Wilma, he single-handedly destroyed
their entire fleet of warships.

1015
01:18:07,357 --> 01:18:10,469
- He sent us to warn you.
- Meet me there on the flight deck.

1016
01:18:10,744 --> 01:18:11,829
I'm going to find Buck.

1017
01:18:18,305 --> 01:18:21,098
<i>Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1018
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:24,168
Theo, Twiki, over here!

1019
01:18:26,629 --> 01:18:28,268
It's good to see you again, Buck.

1020
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:31,400
Yeah, well cut out the formality.
This magazine's about to blow.

1021
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,387
Help is on the way.

1022
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:35,256
- What do you mean help?
- Wilma is coming in to get us.

1023
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,755
What? She can't land here.
She'll be killed.

1024
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:54,440
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1025
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:57,969
- It's time to go.
- This way, Buck. Through the smoke.

1026
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,025
Taxi cab! Taxi!

1027
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:18,987
Let's get out of here.
That magazine's about to blow.

1028
01:19:19,008 --> 01:19:20,874
I'm with you.
Get in!

1029
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:47,380
Very nice.

1030
01:19:47,971 --> 01:19:50,490
Thank you. But we're
not in the clear yet.

1031
01:20:07,358 --> 01:20:09,453
We would be rulers of Earth now...

1032
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,797
if you hadn't let
Buck Rogers on board!

1033
01:20:13,024 --> 01:20:15,857
He wouldn't have been necessary
if you were more of a man.

1034
01:20:19,243 --> 01:20:23,136
We owe you a great deal more
than apology, Buck. Especially me.

1035
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:26,708
I confess, I thought the
princess had you beguiled.

1036
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:30,757
Well, I will say she had the
nicest set of... horns at the ball.

1037
01:20:30,945 --> 01:20:32,987
Yes, it was an attractive hat.

1038
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:37,874
You'll never be the man Buck Rogers is.

1039
01:20:38,597 --> 01:20:40,865
We'll see when we
meet Mr. Rogers again.

1040
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:42,294
And we will.

1041
01:20:43,312 --> 01:20:44,417
I hope so.

1042
01:20:49,115 --> 01:20:50,152
Buck...

1043
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:54,971
I know I've been aloof
towards you... cold.

1044
01:20:55,211 --> 01:20:57,840
I was frightened,
afraid to get involved.

1045
01:20:59,864 --> 01:21:01,682
Things are going to be
different now between us.

1046
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:04,550
I'm not all business.

1047
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:07,178
I am every bit the woman
that the princess was.

1048
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:09,588
That's nice.

1049
01:21:10,477 --> 01:21:13,032
And, from this moment on,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1050
01:21:14,293 --> 01:21:15,012
What?

1051
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:18,052
Well, I guess that's the
last we'll see of Kane...

1052
01:21:18,643 --> 01:21:19,819
and the princess.

1053
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:21,963
Wakey!

1054
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:28,815
Eyes forward.

1055
01:21:29,477 --> 01:21:30,503
We'll get star sick.

1056
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:33,834
Buck! You're my kind of guy.
