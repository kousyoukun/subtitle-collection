有效载荷位于巨大火箭的前锥上。

使飞船绕一圈回到原点的轨道。

19
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:23,213
不是五个月，而是500年后。
not in five months, but in 500 years.

关于这艘船有什么事。我从没见过这样的东西。

26
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,448
准备好被拖走。

27
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:31,895
在力场中包围外星人飞船…

28
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,308
让她准备登上德龙尼亚号。

29
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,631
——神经系统传输。——在运输。

00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,065
他的活着。
He's alive.

36
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:30,731
进入。

37
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,190
我们的入侵者如此重要，等不及了，凯恩?

38
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,538
那个人的生活。我不知道为什么。

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,424
你不知道为什么。这是一个需要我破译的难题吗?

40
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,629
这个谜得由我来解。

41
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:53,956
这艘船过时了。不像我在星系里见过的任何东西…
The ship is antiquated... unlike anything I've seen in the star system...

42
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,603
或者历史书之外的东西。
or outside of history books for that matter.

43
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,028
请凯恩。
Kane, please.

44
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:00,923
他被一种混合气体冻住了。

45
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:04,160
氧气，制冷剂，臭氧，金属。

46
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,193
几乎达到了完美的平衡。

00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:10,373
这些技术在整个星系中用于治疗绝症和疾病。

48
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,640
是的,今天。

49
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:14,369
然而，还有另一件事。这个人的船。
However, there is another matter. The man's ship.

50
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:16,528
凯恩，再给你一分钟。
Kane, you have one more minute.

51
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:18,842
他的仪器被停止了…
His instrumentation was stopped...

52
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:22,522
1987年冻成固体
frozen solid in the year 1987.

53
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:26,529
-你是说…?那人可能有500岁了。
- Are you telling me...? - That the man may be 500 years old.

54
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:31,635
——你是认真的吗?——是的。
- You're serious? - Yes.

55
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,616
被瞬间和完美的元素冻结…
Frozen by elements so instantaneous and perfect...

56
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,298
他被完好地保存下来并活着。
that he is fully preserved and living.

57
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,610
这是一个令人着迷的想法。

58
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,083
-保幼还是保老?——非常年轻。
- Preserved young or preserved old? - Very young.

59
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,765
有什么缺点吗?
Any defects from the ordeal?

60
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,736
幸运的是，我们在低温学方面相当先进。
Fortunately for him, we're quite advanced in cryogenics.

61
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,213
我从没见过一个500岁的老人。让他做好面对观众的准备。
Well, I've never met a 500 year old man. Prepare him for an audience.

62
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,398
恐怕他的思路不太清晰。
I'm afraid he's liable to be not too coherent.

63
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,112
我会体谅。
I'll make allowances.

64
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:23,646
-我在哪?-我们问问题。
- Where I am? - We ask the questions.

65
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,617
你是谁?
Who are you?

66
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:29,491
巴克·罗杰斯上尉，美国空军。
Captain Buck Rogers, United States Air Force.

67
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,877
-你是谁?-他说什么了?
- Who are you? - What did he say?

68
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:35,097
是关于美国的。
Something about a united states.

69
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:38,451
机长，你的目的地是哪里?
Captain, what is your destination?

70
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,316
-什么事?——我的头。
- What is it? - My head.

71
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:46,761
能给我一片阿司匹林吗?-他什么意思?
- Could I get an aspirin? - What does he mean?

72
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,758
可能是止痛药。
Probably some kind of anti-pain drug.

73
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,108
给他点药减轻他的不适。
Give him something for his discomfort.

74
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,134
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

75
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:03,922
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

76
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:08,328
你是谁?
Who are you?

77
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,739
你在国王的旗舰德龙尼亚上…
You're aboard the king's flagship Draconia...

78
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,476
在皇家公主阿达拉的指挥下。
under command of the royal princess Ardala.

79
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,345
——谁?-你从哪里来?
- Who? - Where are you from.?

80
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,225
不。等等,等等,等等。慢下来。
No. Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

81
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,093
那艘船是怎么回事?
What was that about a ship?

82
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:32,148
这是国王的堡垒之一，正在前往地球执行和平任务的途中。
One of the king's fortresses on its way to Earth on a peace mission.

83
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,374
在飞往地球的途中?
On its way to Earth?

84
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,824
你是说你们不是…?
You mean you guys aren't from...?

85
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,844
我是说，我们不是…
I mean, we're not...

86
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,986
我们不在地球上?
We're not on Earth?

87
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:49,834
我肯定需要那片阿司匹林。
I'm definitely going to need that aspirin.

88
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,196
-给他-等一下。
- Give it to him. - Wait a second.

89
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:52,937
哦!
Oh!

90
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,567
队长。
Captain.

91
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:58,682
记住，你是一个俘虏…
Bear in mind that you're a captive...

92
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:01,954
一个征服了四分之三宇宙的王朝
of a dynasty that has conquered 3/4 of the universe.

93
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,028
如果你珍惜你的生命，你就会谨慎地回答。
You will answer carefully if you value your life.

94
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:12,944
你是真正的公主吗?
Are you a real life princess?

95
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,970
我想我们给船长的药有点多了。
I think we've given our captain a little too much medication.

96
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,155
不，不，我感觉很好。
No, no, I feel great.

97
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,050
美利坚合众国……
The United States of America...

98
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:39,191
几个世纪前，它是地球上的一个帝国。
It was an empire on the planet Earth some centuries ago.

99
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:42,433
那些皇家教师给你的钱是值得的。
Those royal tutors gave you your money's worth.

100
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,965
凯恩，你来自地球。你应该比我更清楚。
Well, you're from Earth, Kane. You should know better than I.

101
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:48,528
美国在近500年前就灭亡了。
The United States had perished almost 500 years ago.

102
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,354
这就解释了他的飞船，他的衣服，仪器。
Well, that would account for his spacecraft, his clothes, the instruments.

103
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:55,542
我有一个更好的解释。我认为它是一株非常聪明的植物……
I have a better explanation. I think he's a very clever plant...

104
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,653
来自联邦地球局。
from the Federal Directorate of Earth.

105
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,542
——一种植物?——是的。
- A plant? - Yes.

106
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,933
一个被他们军队安插在我们面前的间谍。
An spy placed in our path by their military.

107
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:06,688
他们不敢。我们是我父王王国的皇家使者。
They wouldn't dare. We come as a royal envoy from my father's kingdom.

108
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:09,392
我完全了解你父亲陈述的目的。
I am fully aware of your father's stated purpose.

109
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:12,541
地球和严酷王朝之间的保证贸易。
The guarantee trade between Earth and the Draconian dynasty.

110
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,655
他们在船上安置间谍可能有什么理由呢?
What possible reason could they have in placing a spy on board?

111
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:17,578
搜查我们的船。
To search our ship.

112
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,904
-看看我们有没有武器。——我明白了。
- To see if we're armed. - I see.

113
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,189
-我们不能允许这样，对吧?——没有。
- We couldn't allow that, could we? - No.

114
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,307
那么，我想我可以把罗杰斯船长处理掉了。
Then I'm to assume that I may dispose of Captain Rogers as I see fit.

115
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:34,200
如何处理安全问题是您的特权。
How you handle security is your prerogative.

116
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,098
来吧，老虎侠。
Come on, Tiger Man.

117
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,042
什么一个布局!哇!
What a layout! Wow!

118
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,998
-今天早上好吗?——棒极了。
- And how are we this morning? - Terrific.

119
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,840
嘿!这是一个巧合。我也有一艘这样的船。
Hey! That's a coincidence. I got a ship just like this.

120
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,534
断开的药物。
Disconnect the medication.

121
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:08,728
哦，不要那样做。我真的很喜欢。
Oh, don't do that. I really love it.

122
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,615
-你马上就来。——太棒了。我们要去哪里?
- You'll be on your way very shortly. - Great. Where are we going?

123
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,804
-你要回家。——太棒了。那是哪儿?
- You're going home. - Great. Where is that?

124
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,963
——地球上。——哦,对!
- On Earth. - Oh, right!

125
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:20,316
你的飞船已经检修好并重新编程，可以带你回家了。
Your ship has been serviced and reprogrammed to take you home.

126
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:22,590
-我想你一定很焦虑。-哦,是的。
- I sure you must be anxious. - Oh, yeah.

127
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,517
我好像好几个星期没去了。
Seems like I haven't been there for weeks.

128
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,426
哦。哦。
Oh. Oh.

129
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:34,014
和你们在一起一定很开心。
I must be having a great time with you guys.

130
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:37,019
你知道我会想你的。嘿!我有个好主意。
You know I'm going to miss you. Hey! I got a great idea.

131
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,016
不如我们一起下去吧?
Why don't we all go down there together?

132
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,127
你先去吧。我们过几天就来。
You go on ahead. We'll be along in a few days.

133
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,051
如果我醒来就不会了。
Not if I wake up.

134
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:50,534
再见。哦，我是在做梦吗?
Bye bye. Oh, am I dreaming this?

135
00:12:57,952 --> 00:13:01,857
天啊，等我带着这个故事回来休斯顿，他们一定会大吃一惊的。
Boy, they're going to be surprised back in Houston when I come back with this story.

136
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,527
电池。
Battery.

137
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,638
准备发射外星飞船。
Prepare to launch the alien vessel.

138
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,731
离发射还有5秒。四个……
Five seconds to launch. Four...

139
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,222
三两个…
three two...

140
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:27,176
一个。发射。
one. Launch.

141
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,412
这给了我们测试地球防御系统的绝佳机会。
It's given us the perfect opportunity to test the Earth's defense shield.

142
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,886
测试是什么意思?
What do you mean test it?

143
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:39,856
我们知道任何进入地球表面的人…
We know that anyone entering the earth surface...

144
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:42,235
未经许可立即焚烧。
without a clearance is immediately incinerated.

145
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,167
但如果我们的队长是间谍，我相信…
But if our captain is a spy, as I believe...

146
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,122
他们将护送他穿过盾牌……
they will escort him through the shield...

147
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:52,204
沿着狭窄的海峡，只有他们的军队知道。
along the narrow channel only known to their military.

148
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,785
这对我们有什么帮助呢?
Well, how can this help us?

149
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:57,198
我在罗杰斯船长的船上藏了一个微型发报机……
I've hidden a micro-transmitter aboard Captain Rogers' ship...

150
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,735
它会发送回相当于指南地图的信息。
which will send back the equivalent of a guide map.

151
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:02,070
当我们发出信号时…
When we give the signal...

152
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,404
那份指南地图将被你父亲的攻击部队使用…
that guide map will be used by your father's attack forces...

153
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,460
冲过他们的防御盾。
to pour through their defense shield.

154
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,805
如果我们的罗杰斯队长不是间谍怎么办?
What if our Captain Rogers is not a spy?

155
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,940
然后，他会燃烧。
Then, he will burn.

156
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,684
我明白了。
I see.

157
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:16,802
你看起来不太高兴。
You don't look very pleased.

158
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,595
我当然很高兴。
Of course I'm pleased.

159
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:25,191
只是我有一种奇怪的感觉，我又会见到罗杰斯上尉了。
It's just that I have this strange feeling I'm going to see Captain Rogers again.

160
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,343
<i>空气控制1到船Able，贝克4.</i>

00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:04,327

Ah... Sir. Super?

171
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,959
超级。这是哪一站?
Super on. What station is this?

172
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:11,353
三角洲地区，长官。我不常给你打电话。
Delta sector, sir. You don't hear from me very often.

173
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:13,181
是的，三角洲部门?
Yes, yes Delta sector?

174
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:16,788
我的扫描仪监视低频直接通信频段。
My scanners monitor the low frequency direct communication band.

175
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,759
<i>我正在听到一些声音或什么的。</i>

没有什么可大惊小怪的。
Nothing to be alarmed about.

178
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,534
可能是昨晚货船遭袭的回声。
Probably echoes from last night's attack on our freighters.

179
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,688
<i>这些信号将在整个星期上下跳动。</i>
<i>Those signals will be bouncing around all week.</i>

180

是的，长官，我是说，不，长官，这不是回音，长官。
Yes sir. I mean, no sir. This isn't an echo, sir.

181
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:36,056
这是一个声音。强大的声音。这是唱歌。
It's a voice. A strong voice. It's singing.

182
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:38,517
——唱歌吗?——是的。

183
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:42,988
-三角洲部门，你是说“唱歌”吗?——是的。

<i>Hey! Come on you turkeys, get off your duff and give me some info.</i>

192
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,363
它几乎是一门外语。
It's practically a foreign language.

193
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,565
也许是什么笑话?
Maybe some kind of joke?

194
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,274
它直接飞向防御盾。让我拦截。
It's heading directly to the defense shield. Get me Intercept.

195
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:57,491
<i>拦截中队连线，请。</i>
<i>Intercept squadron on the line, please.</i>

196
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:00,680
上校-迪尔岭。坐标是什么?
Colonel Deering. What are the coordinates?

197
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,486
正确的。我们的目标是100英里外的盾号来识别飞船。
Right. We're targeting the shield 100 miles to identify the craft.

198
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,590
警惕,拦截空中。外星飞船的位置。
Alert, Intercept airborned. Position of alien craft.

199
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,791
——非常奇怪。——奇怪的是什么?
- Very odd. - What's odd?

200
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,643
目标似乎移动得异常缓慢
The target seems to be moving unusually slow

201
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,149
对任何传统航天器来说都不稳定。
and erratic for any conventional spacecraft.

202
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,487
我有可视目标。
I have target in visual sight.

203
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,958
它是什么?
What is it?

204
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:59,776
嘿,好吧。我看到你…
Hey, alright. I see you...

205
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:01,479
人。
guys.

206
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,367
你是谁?
Who are you?

207
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:09,745
你是什么?
What are you?

208
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,266
注意,外星人飞船。你读过吗?
Attention, alien spacecraft. Do you read?

209
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,490
为什么叫“外星人”?你自己看起来也不那么面熟。
Why do call an "alien"? You don't look so familiar yourself, you know.

210
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:17,679
<我>你是谁? < / i >
<i>Who are you?</i>

211
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:21,100
请将你的答案限制在“是”或“不是”。你的处境很危险。
Please restrict your answers to "yes" or "no". You're in grave danger.

212
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:22,558
从谁?你吗?
From who? You?

213
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:25,330
你正穿过一条狭窄的走廊进入我们的内城。
You are traversing a narrow corridor into our inner cities.

214
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:27,977
内心的什么?看,夫人……
Inner what? Look, lady...

215
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:30,051
上校-迪尔岭。现在，请安静。
Colonel Deering. Now, please be quiet.

216
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:32,886
如果你偏离我的命令哪怕一千码…
If you deviate from my orders by so much as a thousand yards...

217
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:35,630
你会被烧成蒸汽，你明白吗?
you will be burned into vapour, do you understand?

218
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:39,695
蒸汽吗?是的，是的，我明白。我该怎么办?
Vapours? Yeah yeah, I understand. What do I do?

219
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,750
你有手动超越的能力吗?——确定。
- Do you have manual override capabilities? - Sure.

220
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,131
那么，请紧紧跟着我。
Then, follow me very closely.

221
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:46,825
紧盯着你。
Be right on your tail.

222
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:04,861
这次真的搞砸了。肯定是俄罗斯人干的。
Really blow it this time. Gotta be the Russians.

223
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,008
你做得很好。
You're doing just fine.

224
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,072
-你说什么?-我只是想表示友好。
- I beg your pardon? - I'm just trying to be friendly.

225
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,943
侵犯我们的领空是一种战争行为，而不是友谊。
Violating our airspace is an act of war, not friendship.

226
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,780
现在等着海角那边的人听到这个吧。
Now wait until the guys at the Cape hear this.

227
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,868
巴克·罗杰斯在红场中央坐下。
Buck Rogers sets down in the middle of Red Square.

走廊1-0，可容纳来客船只。
in the Corridor 1-0 Able for incoming vessel.

232
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,671
嘿,宝贝。这是一个相当好的安排。
Hey, babe. This is quite a setup.

233
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,431
我是迪林上校，地球防御部队指挥官。
It's Colonel Deering, Commander of Earth Defenses.

234
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:38,061
-那么这一切都是你负责的?——这是正确的。
- Then you're in charge of all this? - That's right.

235
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:41,117
-现在，如果没有问题了…-上校，放心吧。
- Now, if there are no more questions... - Why, Colonel, take it easy.

236
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,722
我随时都愿意和你一起飞行。
I'd fly with you anytime.

237
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:48,048
-把这个野蛮人抓去审问。——什么?
- Take this barbarian in for interrogation. - What?

238
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,837
嘿!嘿，等一下!
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

239
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:52,964
等等!
Wait!

240
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,784
什么你…你在做什么?嘿,等等!
What you... What are you doing? Hey wait!

241
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,202
你好，罗杰斯船长。
How do you do, Captain Rogers?

242
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:16,067
我是Huer医生。我很高兴见到你。
My name's Dr. Huer. And I'm very pleased to meet you.

243
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:17,566
到底发生了什么事?
Just what's going on?

244
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,480
我在哪里，你在对我做什么?
Where am I and what are you doing to me?

245
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,130
我们在研究你。全是电子的，无痛的。
Well, we're studying you. It's all electronic and painless.

246
00:21:24,022 --> 00:21:27,598
但到目前为止，我们和你一样对所发生的事感到困惑不解。
But so far we're as boggled as you are by what happened.

247
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:30,560
您的测试正在产生最显著的数据。
Your testing is producing the most phenomenal data.

248
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,378
棒极了。但是发生了什么呢?
Terrific. But what is happening?

249
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,788
因为如果我死了，很明显我去不了天堂。
Cos if I'm dead, I obviously didn't make it to heaven.

250
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,352
那么这到底是什么行星呢?
So just what planet is this?

251
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:39,437
地球上什么?哦，当然是地球。
What planet? Oh, it's Earth, of course.

252
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:42,082
你按任务要求回来了……
You returned as your mission required...

253
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:47,741
接近你飞船上最初设定的精确着陆区域。
to almost the precise landing area originally programmed into your ship.

254
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:52,851
啊,看,医生。
Aah, look, Doc.

255
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,759
我经历了很多…
I've been through a lot...

256
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:58,651
但是你不可能告诉我…
but there is no way you can tell me that...

257
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:01,245
那边的那个城市和芝加哥很像。
that city out there is anything like Chicago.

258
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:04,902
不,它不是。地球上再也没有芝加哥这样的城市了。
No, it isn't. There's nothing like Chicago left on Earth.

259
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:10,351
请允许我介绍我的行政长官，西奥波利斯博士。
Allow me to bring in my administrator, Dr. Theopolis.

260
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:11,980
现在看来,医生…
Now look, Doc...

261
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,948
Twiki，请你把Theopolis医生带来好吗?
Twiki, would you bring in Dr. Theopolis, please?

262
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,949
-那是什么?-是Twiki。
- What is that? - It is Twiki.

263
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:31,793
-他是你的无人机。——我什么?
- He's your drone. - My what?

264
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:34,823
在你听取汇报和下定决心的这段时间里…
Well, for the duration of your debriefing and determination...

265
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,133
Twiki会作为你的助手。
Twiki will act as your aide.

266
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:41,014
这……我是Theopolis医生。
And this... This is Dr. Theopolis.

267
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,025
早上好，Theopolis博士。可爱的一天。
Good morning, Dr. Theopolis. Lovely day.

268
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:46,124
谢谢你！我尽力了。
Thank you. I did my best.

269
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,990
Theopolis博士是我们计算机委员会的成员。
Dr. Theopolis here is a member of our Computer Council.

270
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:51,871
除此之外，他个人也要负责……
And in addition to other things, he is personally responsible...

271
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:54,616
我们对内城环境的控制
for all our environmental controls here within the Inner City.

272
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,998
这给今晚的日落带来了一抹淡紫色。
This introducing a pale hint of mauve into the sunset this evening.

273
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,788
没有紫水晶那么深……
Not so deep as an amethyst...

274
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,978
但肉桂更微妙的灼伤质感。
but the more subtle burn texture of cinnamon.

275
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,735
好,多好。
Well, how nice.

276
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:07,031
我真希望船长能和我们一起看。
I do hope our captain can watch it with us.

277
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,954
一定会很好吃的。
It's truly going to be lovely.

278
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,517
如果我是你，我会和编程的人联系。
If I were you, I'd check in with whoever's programming that thing.

279
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,922
罗杰斯船长，是我们在会议上…
Captain Rogers, it is we on the Council...

280
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:19,187
为整个城市做节目的人
who do the programming for the entire city.

281
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:23,365
敬请保留您的意见。我们开始谈案子吧?
And kindly reserve your opinion. Shall we get down to cases?

282
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,426
罗杰斯上尉,我…最后我要给你一个忠告。
Captain Rogers, I... I'll leave you with a word of advice.

283
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,563
这些四轴飞行器不是由人编的程序。
These quads are not programmed by man.

284
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:34,617
它们已经被彼此编程好几代了。
They've been programmed by one another over for generations.

285
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,731
你看，我们犯过的错误……
You see, the mistakes we have made...

286
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:40,447
在某些领域，比如我们的环境……
in areas, well, like our environment...

287
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:42,690
已经完全移交给他们了
have been entirely turned over to them.

288
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,159
他们把地球从厄运中拯救了出来。
And they saved the Earth from certain doom.

289
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,925
一点一点，把我们带回来，这样我们就不会有
Little by little, bringing us back, so that we will not have

290
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:51,221
完全依赖其他星球获取食物和水。
to depend entirely on other planets for our food and water.

291
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:53,662
四胞胎不是人类，但是…
The quads are not human, but...

292
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,624
你会伤害他们的感情。
you can hurt their feelings.

293
00:23:56,056 --> 00:24:00,120
正是这种敏感度将它们与单纯的机器区分开来。
It's this sensitivity that separates them from mere machines.

294
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,731
16小时后再见。
So, I'll see you again in approximately 16 hours.

295
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:07,970
16小时?等一下!
16 hours? Wait a minute!

296
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:11,261
你以为我会坐在这里对着一个盒子讲16个小时吗?
Do you think I'm going to sit here and talk to a box for 16 hours?

297
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:16,075
坐下来,队长。让我们双方都尽量愉快些。
Sit down, captain. Let's both try to be as pleasant as possible.

298
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:19,717
那是个好人。
That's a good fellow.

299
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:22,591
做个好无人机，Twiki，把我放在桌子上…
Be a good drone, Twiki, and place me on the table...

300
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,489
我在哪里可以好好地看船长呢
where I can get a good look at the captain

301
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,595
你去给他买点饮料。
while you get him some liquid refreshment.

302
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,457
嗯,这是好的。我不需要任何液体饮料。
Well, that's alright. I don't need any liquid refreshment.

303
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:31,637
你当然知道。
Of course you do.

304
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:34,474
你已经极度脱水了，巴克。
You're extremely dehydrated from your ordeal, Buck.

305
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:36,190
如果我可以叫你巴克的话。
If I may call you Buck.

306
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,493
现在快去Twiki给Rogers上尉拿来他的饮料。
Now run along Twiki and get Captain Rogers his drink.

307
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,067
现在……
Well now...

308
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,719
你是一个多么有魅力的人啊，巴克·罗杰斯船长。
what an attractive man you are, Captain Buck Rogers.

309
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,857
现在看来……
Now look...

310
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:56,404
我已经等了24小时了…
I've been waiting 24 hours...

311
00:24:56,426 --> 00:25:00,453
去发现我在哪里，我是谁，你是谁。
to find out where I am, who I am, who you are.

312
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,173
我能知道一些答案吗?
Can I have some answers?

313
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:06,165
当然,巴克。这就是为什么我在这里，来回答你们的问题。
Certainly, Buck. That's why I'm here, to answer your questions.

314
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:07,843
太好了。让我们拥有它。
Great. Let's have it.

315
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:11,267
好吧，你是巴克·罗杰斯船长，根据你的航海日志……
Well, you are Captain Buck Rogers, and according to your ship's log...

316
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:13,378
你在1987年离开了地球。
You left Earth in 1987.

317
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,492
我知道的就这些。告诉我我不知道的。
That much I know. Tell me what I don't know.

318
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:18,444
如果初步数据站得住脚
Well, if preliminary data holds up,

319
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:22,597
似乎你在504年后回到了地球。
it appears you have returned to Earth 504 years later.

320
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,669
你们现在是在25世纪。
You are now in the 25th century.

321
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,291
巴克?你没事吧，巴克?
Buck? Are you alright, Buck?

322
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,026
你听到了吗?
Did you hear me?

323
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:35,376
巴克?
Buck?

324
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:38,875
我想我现在想喝一杯。
I think I want a drink now.

325
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:48,515
你可以相信我的话。他是个了不起的人。相信我。
You can take my word. He's a wonderful man. Believe me.

326
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:51,426
我确实相信，你相信他是个了不起的人……
I do believe, that you believe that he's a wonderful man...

327
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,827
但你不能拿我们少数人的生命冒险
but you're not being asked to risk the lives of our few

328
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,860
在他的诡计下幸存的战士。
surviving warriors on his subterfuge.

329
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:59,452
他只是一个人。他能做什么危害我们人民的事呢?
He is only one man. What can he possibly do to endanger our people?

330
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,073
他可以企图与德古尼亚撕毁条约。
He could attempt to discredit the treaty with Draconia.

331
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:06,337
但他并没有这样的尝试。他向我们走来，神情茫然。
But he has made no such attempt. He comes to us a bewildered man.

332
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:10,164
我希望有机会和我们船长呆一段时间。
I would like the opportunity to spend some time with our captain.

333
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:13,800
如果你想在他的证词中挑毛病，那你是在浪费时间。
If you're hoping to find fault with his testimony, you'll waste your time.

334
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,046
拯救地球绝不是浪费时间…
Saving Earth cannot be a waste of time...

335
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:18,515
尽管不得不忍受船长的陪伴。
despite having to endure the captain's company.

336
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:22,088
如果泰奥波利斯医生没有异议…我没有。
Well, if Dr. Theopolis has no objections... I have none.

337
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:24,891
我没有反对意见。
I have no objections.

338
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,085
船长是属于我的，除非我揭穿他。
And the captain belongs to me until I expose him.

339
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,355
我没有看见迪林上校……
I have not seen Colonel Deering...

340
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:37,310
对以前的任何事都如此一反常态地情绪化。
so uncharacteristically emotional about anything before.

341
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,704
也没有任何人。
Nor anyone.

342
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,337
这部分看起来更像是一场梦而不是一场噩梦。
This part seems more of a dream than a nightmare.

343
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:55,199
听着，我昨天有点吵。我向你道歉。
Look, I was a little loud yesterday. I'd like to apologize.

344
00:26:55,262 --> 00:26:56,969
我接受你的道歉，上尉。
I accept your apology, captain.

345
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,614
告诉我关于大屠杀的事。
Tell me about the holocaust.

346
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:04,575
我不能。
I can't.

347
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,947
嗯，直到我听到它，感觉到它。它不是真实的。
Well, until I hear it and feel it. It isn't real.

348
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:12,336
听着，我失去了对我重要的一切。
Look, I lost everything that was important to me.

349
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,255
母亲，父亲，兄弟，姐妹，一个我关心的女人。
A mother, father, brothers, sisters, a woman I cared for.

350
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:19,498
直到我听到一些让我信服不同的东西…
And until I hear something that convinces me different...

351
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:23,325
他们现在在时间和空间的某个地方等着我。
they're waiting for me right now, somewhere else in time and space.

352
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:29,080
-外面怎么样?-城外?你不会喜欢的。
- What's it like on the outside? - Outside the city? You wouldn't like it.

353
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:32,168
——辐射?-在某些地方。
- Radiation? - In some places.

354
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,396
到处都是废墟和焦土。
Ruins and scorched earth everywhere else.

355
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:37,069
这就是为什么我们如此依赖与其他星球的贸易。
That's why we're so dependent on trade with other planets.

356
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:41,065
与龙人和公主的贸易协定。这到底是怎么回事?
This trade agreement with the Draconians and the princess. What's that all about?

357
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:45,076
海盗封锁了我们的航路，使我们的粮食吃不消。
We're being starved out by pirates who choke off our shipping lines.

358
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:47,934
龙人已经答应保持我们的补给线畅通……
The Draconians have promised to keep our supply lines open...

359
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:51,151
来换取登陆地球的特权
in return for landing privileges here on Earth.

360
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,451
我想看看我的船。这有可能吗?
I'd like to see my ship. Is that possible?

361
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,672
一切皆有可能，上尉。
Anything is possible, captain.

362
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:01,899
那些卫兵认为我们疯了，在夜里这么晚出来。
Those guards thought we were crazy coming out here at this hour of the night.

363
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:04,216
我睡得够我一辈子的了。
I've had enough sleep to last me a lifetime.

364
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,008
你认识这些记号吗?
Do you recognize these markings?

365
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:12,223
这对于在战斗中的飞机来说是很常见的。
Fairly common for an aircraft that had been in combat.

366
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,403
我没有参加战斗。你们的船向我开火了吗?
Well, I wasn't in combat. Did your ships fire on me?

367
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,556
——当然不是。-那是谁干的?
- Certainly not. - Then who did?

368
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,497
可能是海盗袭击了我们的船只。
Possibly pirates who've been attacking our shipping.

369
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,886
为什么我还在这里?他们为什么没把我干掉?
And why am I still here? Why didn't they finish me off?

370
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:25,664
他们为什么不把船拆开，至少把它打开?
Why didn't they strip the ship or at least open it?

371
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:29,209
你以为海盗会彻底检查一艘没有武装的船……
You'd think pirates would be thorough enough to check out an unarmed ship...

372
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,273
特别是一辆他们不厌其烦地开着的车。
particularly one they bothered to fire on.

373
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,736
你坐了很长时间的飞机。任何事情都可能发生。
You've been in flight a long time. Anything could have happened.

374
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:40,531
是啊，这些烧伤是新鲜的。cordite仍未被碱化。
Yeah, well those burns are fresh. The cordite is still unoxidized.

375
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,313
我想阿达拉公主的攻击战士向我开火了……
I think Princess Ardala's attack fighters fired on me...

376
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:44,830
在他们把我拖上船之前。
before they towed me aboard her ship.

377
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:50,258
-她的船没有武装。这就是法律。-是啊，她好像在弯曲它。
- Her ship is unarmed. That is the law. - Yeah well, she seems to be bending it.

378
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:51,963
船长，你有什么建议?
What would you suggest, Captain?

379
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,912
我建议彻底搜查她的船
I would suggest thoroughly searching her ship

380
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,080
然后让它进入你的防御盾。
before you allow it inside your defense shield.

381
00:28:57,123 --> 00:29:00,579
而不是以一种侮辱的方式开始建立一个基于诚信的联盟。
Rather an insulting way to begin an alliance based on good faith.

382
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:04,399
诚信是留给官僚的。它不会给你一个盖上盖子的城市。
Good faith is for bureaucrats. It won't get you a city with a lid on it.

383
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,881
我会全副武装，全副武装，全副武装，
I'd go up there armed to the teeth, full squadron,

384
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,361
否则你会成为活靶子。
otherwise you'll be sitting ducks.

385
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:12,743
对于一个专业知识据说有五个世纪历史的人来说…
For a man whose expertise is allegedly five centuries old...

386
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:14,764
你似乎很固执己见。
you seem quite opinionated.

387
00:29:15,268 --> 00:29:16,321
你是对的。
You're right.

388
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,579
你怎么炸了你的世界不关我的事。
It's none of my business how you blow up your world.

389
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:21,995
我们那一代人也不知道自己在做什么。
My generation didn't know what they were doing either.

390
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:24,194
-晚安，上校。-上尉，你去哪儿?
- Good night, Colonel. - Where are you going, Captain?

391
00:29:24,313 --> 00:29:27,384
-我要去看看这个城市。——你怀疑。你不能。
- I'm going to look around the city. - You're suspicion. You can't.

392
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:29,505
我想知道500年来发生了什么变化。
I'd like to find out what's changed in 500 years.

393
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:33,725
——这是禁止的。-这是个自由的国家。至少，它是。
- That's forbidden. - It's a free country. At least, it was.

394
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:37,768
严格地说，你还是被捕的，还是我的囚犯。我不能让你走。
Technically you're still under arrest and my prisoner. I can't let you go.

395
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:39,675
你得开枪才能阻止我，上校。
You'll have to shoot me to stop me, Colonel.

396
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,596
你让我别无选择。
You leave me little choice.

397
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:54,112
你不用跟我来的，西奥。
You didn't have to come with me, Theo.

398
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,845
我想和你在一起，巴克。我希望你听了理由。
I wanted to be with you, Buck. I wish you'd listened to reasons.

399
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,497
与未来相比，这算不了什么。
This is nothing compared to what lies ahead.

400
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,505
我们为什么不在这里过夜呢?
Why don't we stay here for the night?

401
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,986
哦，我怕我们会冻死。
Oh, I'm afraid we'd freeze to death.

402
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,922
你所感受到的那一点点温暖都来自城市的内城。
What little warmth you feel is emanated from the Inner City.

403
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:13,096
在几个小时内，他们切断了三分之二的电力。
In a few hours, they cut power by two thirds...

404
00:30:13,152 --> 00:30:15,620
温度会降到零度以下。
and it will drop well below zero out here.

405
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,890
哦，我想它就在正前方。
Well, it's straight ahead then I guess.

406
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,013
我只是很抱歉把你们扯进来。
I'm just sorry I brought you guys into all this.

407
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:23,319
我被指派和你在一起。
I was assigned to be with you.

408
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:26,639
没人强迫我进入你的阵营。我相信你…
No one forced me into your camp. I believed in you...

409
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:27,837
我现在依然如此。
and I still do.

410
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:30,444
-他在说什么?-你不会想知道的
- What is he saying? - You don't want to know.

411
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,443
哦!
Oh!

412
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:43,270
-他现在在说什么?-你不会想知道的
- What's he saying now? - You don't want to know.

413
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:45,898
你们回去。我能忍受外面的一切…
You guys go back. I can put up with whatever's out there...

414
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:48,116
如果它能帮我找到我的族人发生了什么事。
if it helps me to find what happened to my people.

415
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:49,930
我和你在一起，巴克。
I'm with you, Buck.

416
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,850
-他在说什么?-你不会想知道的
- What's he saying? - You don't want to know.

417
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:31,717
别说了，我不想知道。我想知道。
Stop saying I don't want to know. I want to know.

418
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:33,823
他认为我们被监视了。
He thinks we're being watched.

419
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,970
这只是他的想象。来吧。
It's just his imagination. Come on.

420
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:45,598
——这是绝望。绝对的绝望。-我们会没事的。
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless. - Oh we'll be alright.

421
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:54,225
-他们抓的不是你——什么?
- It isn't you they're after. - What?

422
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,127
无意冒犯，但是我们。
No offense, but it's us.

423
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:59,526
我的金电路和零件在黑市上赚了很多钱。
My gold circuits and parts bring a lot of money on the black market.

424
00:32:00,124 --> 00:32:04,143
至于Twiki，好吧，我不想告诉你他们会把他派上什么用场。
As for Twiki, well, I'd hate to tell you the use they'll put him to.

425
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:06,162
巴克，你要去哪儿?
Buck, where are you going?

426
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,909
道富银行
STATE STREET

427
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,718
我的上帝!这是它。
My God! This is it.

428
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,434
我无意攻击你的策略，巴克……
I don't mean to impugn your strategy, Buck...

429
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,023
但是站在街道中间是愚蠢的…
but standing in the middle of the street is stupid...

430
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:25,019
在这种情况下。
under the circumstance.

431
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:30,150
来吧!
Come on!

432
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:34,195
-我不知道他要去哪里-跟着他。
- I don't know where he is going. - Just follow him.

433
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:08,036
-我不知道他在干什么。-跟他走，崔奇。
- I don't know what he's doing. - Just follow him, Twiki.

434
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,428
-圣…-我知道，Twiki。
- Holy... - I know, Twiki.

435
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:23,117
-我看到了。-继续。
- I see them. - Just keep going.

436
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:29,841
不要那样想。你会把电池耗光的。
Don't think thoughts like that. You'll run down your batteries.

437
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:45,382
这是我父母长眠的地方。
This is where my parents are buried.

438
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:47,353
至少我知道一部分。
Well, at least I know part of it.

439
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:50,111
我们不能待太久，巴克。有人在跟踪我们。
We can't stay long, Buck. We're being followed.

440
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:54,271
发生了什么事?
What happened?

441
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,824
只有一块石头，没有日期。
There's only one stone, no date.

442
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,605
只有少数幸运的人被埋了。
Only a few fortunate ones were buried at all.

443
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,996
它发生得如此之快，一家人被埋葬在一起。
It happened so fast, families were buried together.

444
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:06,648
随着所有系统的崩溃，日期变得不重要了。
Dates became unimportant as all systems broke down.

445
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,223
最后，再也没有军队和战争了。
Finally, there were no more armies or fighting.

446
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:13,224
只有饥饿，污染和挥之不去的死亡
Only starvation, contamination and lingering death.

447
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:18,476
-我真希望当时和他们在一起。-你不能回去，巴克。
- I wish I'd been with them. - You can't go back, Buck.

448
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:23,148
过去的已经过去。但你仍然可以帮助我们的未来。
The past is gone. But you can still help us with our future.

449
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,469
如果有未来。恐怕太晚了。
If there is a future. I'm afraid it's too late.

450
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,463
起飞,Twiki。
Take off, Twiki.

451
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:56,661
小心!
Watch out!

452
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,562
脏……
Dirty...

453
00:35:56,591 --> 00:35:59,501
人太多了，巴克。这是绝望的。
There's just too many of them, Buck. It's hopeless.

454
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:07,252
如果有人有什么遗言的话，我想现在是他们说的时候了。
If anyone has any last words, I think now would be the time for them.

455
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,573
让我们离开这里。
Let's get out of here.

456
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,899
哦,上校。什么风把你吹到这样的夜晚来了?
Oh well, Colonel. What brings you out on a night like this?

457
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,778
上尉，我是来找你的，你冒着个人危险。
Captain, I came to find you at some personal risk.

458
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,195
——很有胆量的。——非常什么?
- Very ballsy. - Very what?

459
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:17,097
算了吧。好吧，别指望会有什么宣传。
Forget it. Well, don't expect any fanfare.

460
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:19,950
在你出现之前，我们一直过得很好。西奥?
We were doing just fine until you came along. Right, Theo?

461
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:21,838
——嗯…-别提了，西奥。
- Well... - Forget it, Theo.

462
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,093
至少Twiki站在我这边。
Well, at least Twiki is on my side.

463
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:26,618
事实上，我还挺喜欢这儿的。
Matter of fact, I kind of like it out here.

464
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,353
它有点原始，但它是芝加哥的南部。
It's a bit primitive, but then it is the south side of Chicago.

465
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,479
上尉，我们在浪费时间。我们走吧。
Captain, we're wasting time. Let's go.

466
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,377
我还没看完呢。
I'm not through looking yet.

467
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,235
所以除非你准备开枪打我…
So unless you're prepared to shoot me...

468
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:38,150
上尉，你逃过一次，但这次逃不掉了。中尉。
Captain, you got away once, but not this time. Lieutenant.

469
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:45,136
怎么了?
What's wrong?

470
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:52,083
那是真的，他是为海盗工作。
Then it's true, he's working for the pirates.

471
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,010
我还是不相信。
I still don't believe it.

472
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:56,116
你就孤身一人了，西奥。
Well, you stand alone, Theo.

473
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:59,221
微型发射机安装在他的导航设备上。
The micro-transmitter was attached to his navigational equipment...

474
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:02,042
向敌人暴露我们的秘密通道。
revealing our secret access corridors to our enemies.

475
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,222
那不是一个无辜的人的行为。
That's not the behaviour of an innocent man.

476
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,779
起初我以为他有罪，但后来…
At first I thought he was guilty and then...

477
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:11,149
你对巴克·罗杰斯的评价太主观了。
You're being subjective in your evaluation of Buck Rogers.

478
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:14,831
另一方面，我出于非常实际的原因支持他。
I, on the other hand, support him for very practical reasons.

479
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,808
-它们是什么?-我确信一件事。
- And what are they? - I'm convinced of one thing.

480
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:21,403
我们的朋友罗杰斯船长确实见过阿德拉公主……
Our friend, Captain Rogers, has indeed met the Princess Ardala...

481
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,930
登上了那艘严酷的旗舰。
and has been aboard the draconian flagship.

482
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:26,037
他的描述太精确了。
His descriptions are too precise...

483
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,690
是一个海盗的猜测。
to be the guesswork of a pirate.

484
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:31,517
也许海盗曾登上过她的船，并向他提供了情报。
Perhaps the pirates have been aboard her ship and provided him with the information.

485
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,194
亲爱的，他们是最致命的敌人。
My dear, they are the deadliest of enemies.

486
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:38,681
任何一个海盗都不可能活过这样一次探访，然后讲述这件事。
It is unlikely that any pirate could survive such a visit to tell about it.

487
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:01,136
来自地球的消息，关于罗杰斯船长的命运。
Word from Earth on Captain Rogers' fate.

488
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:03,554
他的船被拦截下来了。
His ship was intercepted and led down...

489
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:04,684
如我所料。
as I expected.

490
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:10,950
我们潜入他船上的发射器提供必要的信息了吗…
Did the transmitter we sneaked aboard his ship provide the necessary information...

491
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:13,608
让我父亲的军队穿过他们的防御盾?
to bring my father's forces through their defense shield?

492
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,566
是的，不过发射机被发现了。
Yes, however the transmitter had been discovered.

493
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,826
-太糟糕了。-没什么区别。
- It's too bad. - It makes no difference.

494
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:22,744
一旦我们在里面受到欢迎，我们就会从里面摧毁这个盾牌。
Once we're welcomed inside, we will destroy the shield from within.

495
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,924
地球人不会怀疑的。
Won't the earthlings be suspicious when.

496
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,137
罗杰斯船长告诉他们他在我们船上?
Captain Rogers tells them he was aboard our ship?

497
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:32,152
他们不会相信他的。罗杰斯上尉是死定了。
They won't believe him. Captain Rogers is as good as dead.

498
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,392
现在别担心审判了。
Now stop worrying about the trial.

499
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,646
我是长老会的成员，我要亲自为你辩护。
I'm a member of the Council and I'm going to defend you personally.

500
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:44,657
谢谢,西奥。至少有一个朋友挺好的。
Thanks, Theo. It's nice to have at least one friend.

501
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:49,269
对不起,Twiki。两个朋友。
I'm sorry, Twiki. Two friends.

502
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,793
计算机委员会准备听取最后的辩论。
The Computer Council is ready to hear the final arguments...

503
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:55,714
在局长诉巴克·罗杰斯船长案中……
in the case of the Directorate versus Captain Buck Rogers...

504
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:58,333
被指控犯有间谍罪和叛国罪
on charges of espionage and treason.

505
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:02,111
——委员的。-国家是基本的。
- Councilor Apol. - The State's is elementary.

506
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:05,405
罗杰斯上尉驾驶一架外国飞机通过我们的防御网络。
Captain Rogers piloted a foreign aircraft through our defense network...

507
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:09,595
用一个微型发射器，向敌人暴露我们的秘密盾牌边界。
with a micro-transmitter, revealing our secret shield borders to our enemy.

508
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,244
你想要什么价格…
What price you may ask...

509
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,211
罗杰斯船长会考虑多少赏金呢
What bounty would Captain Rogers consider

510
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:17,361
仅仅是出卖人类?
just in selling out the human race?

511
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:19,720
只有他和他的海盗朋友能回答这个问题。
Only he and his pirate friends can answer.

512
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:22,180
但我认为…
But I submit that in my opinion...

513
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:26,428
他们不惜一切代价要破坏与德古尼亚的条约。
it is the destruction of the treaty with Draconia that they seek at all cost.

514
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:29,269
因为它的颁布意味着他们的毁灭。
For its enactment spells their doom.

515
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:31,816
国家停止了它的案件。
The State rests its case.

516
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:35,363
我们现在听取辩方的陈述。Theopolis博士。
We will now hear from the defense. Dr. Theopolis.

517
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,928
尊敬的同事们，你们已经听到了证据……
Distinguished colleagues, you have heard the evidence...

518
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,919
我向你提出挑战，将这个人判有罪。
and I challenge you to find this man guilty.

519
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:49,553
没有证据表明他声称在这个星球上拥有与生俱来的权利。
No evidence has been found to suggest his claim to a birthright on this planet...

520
00:40:49,787 --> 00:40:52,002
因为我们都很清楚…
because we all know full well...

521
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:55,372
在大大屠杀之前没有记录存在。
no records exist prior to the great holocaust.

522
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:58,887
他无法解释发射机是如何进入他的船上的。
He has no explanation as how a transmitter got aboard his ship...

523
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:01,049
因为这不是他做的。
because it was not his doing.

524
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,603
他是一场大战中一个无辜的小卒。
He is an innocent pawn in a great war.

525
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:08,758
我告诉你们，我的同事们，如果你们认定这个人有罪…
I say to you, my colleagues, that if you find this man guilty...

526
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:10,808
你必须判我有罪。
you must find me guilty.

527
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:14,917
我的感应器告诉我这个人很好。
My sensors tell me that this man is good.

528
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,520
国防休息。谢谢你！
The defense rests. Thank you.

529
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:23,283
罗杰斯队长，在我们做出判断之前，你还有什么遗言吗?
Captain Rogers, have you any last words before we pass judgment?

530
00:41:27,937 --> 00:41:33,150
我只是一个无辜的卒子，傀儡，随你怎么称呼它。
Just that I'm an innocent pawn, puppet, call it what you will.

531
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:35,080
幕后操纵的是别人。
Somebody else pulls the strings.

532
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:39,010
你最好少担心我，多担心他们。
You'd be better advised to worry less about me and more about them.

533
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:43,568
因为我不能再伤害你了，不管今天结果如何。
Because I can do you no more harm, no matter what the outcome today.

534
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:47,502
但是他或她……
But he or she...

535
00:41:48,143 --> 00:41:49,514
可能会毁了你。
could destroy you.

536
00:41:56,439 --> 00:42:00,019
很好,巴克。我们没有什么可担心的。
Very nice, Buck. We don't have a thing to worry about.

537
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:04,661
经全体一致投票，委员会决定支持该州。
By unanimous vote, the Council finds for the State.

538
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,035
罗杰斯上尉，委员会认定你有罪。
Captain Rogers, the Council finds you guilty.

539
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,843
你的生命将被终结。
Your life is to be terminated.

540
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:15,290
上述终止协议将立即执行。
Said termination will be carried out immediately.

541
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,345
本会议休会。
This council is adjourned.

542
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,280
我真不敢相信。
I don't believe it.

543
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,839
你不打算说什么吗?
Aren't you going to say anything?

544
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:39,459
——没有。——这是荒谬的。
- No. - That's ridiculous.

545
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,258
你被判终止合同。
You have been sentenced for termination.

546
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:46,811
至少，我认为像你这样的男人是会勃然大怒的……
At the very least, I would think a man of your sort would fly into a rage...

547
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,655
抨击我吧。说点什么。
Lash out at me. Say something.

548
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:51,453
再见吗?
Goodbye?

549
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:53,759
巴克,阻止它!你是不合理的。
Buck, stop it! You're being unreasonable.

550
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,889
我被不合理吗?
I'm being unreasonable?

551
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:02,873
这就好像你认为判决不会得到执行一样。
It is almost as if you don't think the sentence will be carried out.

552
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:05,105
嗯，事实上，我不认为会发生什么
Well, as a matter of fact, I don't think there's going

553
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,146
成为身边的任何人来执行这句话。
to be anyone around to carry the sentence out.

554
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,303
至少我知道你们这些人不会掌权。
At least I know you people won't be in charge.

555
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:13,075
你还执著于你关于龙骑士有武器的故事。
You're still clinging to your story about the Draconia bearing arms.

556
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:15,013
我可以证明。
I can prove it.

557
00:43:15,898 --> 00:43:18,574
如果我告诉你……你会怎么说?
What would you say if I told you...

558
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:21,768
我是来给你这个机会的吗
that I came here to give you that chance?

559
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:24,623
如何?
How?

560
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:30,046
飞出去见德龙尼亚旗舰，去证实你的故事……
By flying out to meet the Draconia flagship, to verify your story...

561
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,595
担心他们会找到你。
about them finding you.

562
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,539
和…你在那里的时候会四处看看吗?
And... do a little looking around while you're there?

563
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,091
完全正确。
Exactly.

564
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,333
不不。我…我不喜欢那个计划。
No no. I... I don't like that plan.

565
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:47,647
-这让我担心。——为什么?
- It worries me. - Why?

566
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:50,603
你看，我准备被解雇了。
Well, you see, I'm scheduled for termination.

567
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:53,315
如果我错过了，我可能会有很多麻烦。
If I miss it, I might get into a lot of trouble.

568
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:54,602
巴克!你是不可能的。
Buck! You are impossible.

569
00:43:54,623 --> 00:43:57,420
我给你你的生命，你却给我恶作剧?
I'm offering you your life and you're giving me practical jokes?

570
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:58,783
你看，这就是问题所在。
Well, you see that's the point.

571
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:02,449
你是想终止我的合同…
Are you offering me termination of my termination...

572
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:04,331
还是你只是推迟了?
or are you just postponing it?

573
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,357
如果你能证明你的故事是真的……
If you can prove that your story is true...

574
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:14,360
我们走吧。
Let's go.

575
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:29,300
紧靠我的机翼，舰长。我们会让这些操作简单明了。
Stay close to my wing, Captain. We'll keep the maneuvers nice and simple.

576
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,814
留在auto-flight。你将不会被期望运行任何东西除了油门。
Stay on auto-flight. You won't be expected to run anything but the throttle.

577
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:34,168
谢谢,上校。
Thanks, colonel.

578
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:37,593
我可以偶尔看看窗外吗?嗯?
Is it alright if I occasionally look out the window? Hmm?

579
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:39,480
现在不是轻举妄动的时候，上尉。
This is no time for levity, Captain.

580
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:42,325
我们在这个区域有近三分之一的船只被海盗夺走。
We've lost nearly a third of our ships in this sector to pirates.

581
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,521
当他们击打时，他们击打得很快。
When they hit, they hit fast.

582
00:44:44,665 --> 00:44:46,221
你飞不过计算机。
You can't out-fly the computer.

583
00:44:46,243 --> 00:44:49,279
它将采取任何必要的规避行动来避开他们的导弹。
It will take any necessary evasive action to avoid their missiles.

584
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:52,696
如果你想让那东西飞起来，只需要花我们一艘船。
If you try to fly that thing, you will only cost us a ship.

585
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:54,676
谢谢你的关心。
I appreciate your concern.

586
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:57,080
真希望我带了点东西来读。
Just wish I had brought along something to read.

587
00:44:57,677 --> 00:45:00,555
我画一个目标向量401。
I make a target vector 401.

588
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:03,409
罗杰,上校。我看到目标了。港口。
Roger, Colonel. I have a visual on target. Just to port.

589
00:45:03,588 --> 00:45:05,585
如果你能在这个距离看到…
If you have visual at this distance...

590
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,359
它一定很大。
it must be gigantic.

591
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:20,136
允许上船吗?为什么?
Permission to come aboard? Why?

592
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,384
特使。
A special envoy.

593
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:24,680
我只知道这些。
That's all I know.

594
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:27,649
这不是协议规定的。
It isn't according to protocol.

595
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:31,664
-你认为他们在想什么?-我不知道。
- What do you think they have in mind? - I don't know.

596
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:33,943
但他们已经给了我们很多警告。
But they have given us plenty of warning.

597
00:45:34,195 --> 00:45:36,436
也不会有任何证据背叛我们。
And there'll be nothing in evidence to betray us.

598
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:39,127
我很想知道他们在想什么。
I'll be curious to know what they have in mind.

599
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,205
让我们为他们准备一个特别的欢迎会。
Let's prepare a very special welcome for them.

600
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:46,804
派出我们的海盗船…
Send out our pirate ships...

601
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:49,324
给他们安排一个小惊喜。
and arrange a little surprise for them.

602
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:04,135
欢迎登上德龙尼亚旗舰…
Welcome aboard the flagship Draconia...

603
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:07,301
德拉科的使者，太空的征服者……
envoy of Draco, conqueror of space...

604
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:11,690
阿斯特瑞姆的军阀，严酷王国的统治者。
warlord of Astrium, ruler of the Draconian realm.

605
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:14,373
我把他的女儿给你，阿达拉公主。
I give you his daughter, Princess Ardala.

606
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:18,475
很高兴。这是一种意想不到的乐趣。
Delighted. This is an unexpected pleasure.

607
00:46:18,638 --> 00:46:20,768
我们几乎没有准备好迎接你。
We are hardly prepared to greet you properly.

608
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,154
考虑一下你的时间足够问候。
Consider your time adequate greeting.

609
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:27,074
我是迪林上校，地球理事会第三军的指挥官。
I'm Colonel Deering, Commander of the 3rd Force of the Earth Directorate.

610
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,737
我相信你已经认识罗杰斯上尉了。
And I believe you already know Captain Rogers.

611
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:33,855
但是没有。如果我遇到这么年轻英俊的船长……
But no. If I had met so dashing young captain...

612
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,016
我相信我会记得很清楚。
I'm sure I would have remembered vividly.

613
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:39,220
我想我们没有那个荣幸。
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

614
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:41,848
我想你弄错了，公主。
I think you're mistaken, princess.

615
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:44,806
我从来不会忘记关节。
I never forget a knuckle.

616
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:47,488
船长!
Captain!

617
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,596
听。我们是来弄清事情的真相的。
Listen. We're here to get to the bottom of things.

618
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,970
你想让我描述一下你的内部房间吗?
Would you like me to describe some of your inner chambers?

619
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,838
哦!他指的是什么内室?
Oh! What inner chambers is he referring?

620
00:46:57,972 --> 00:47:00,837
公主也许不会觉得我令人难忘，但我永远不会忘记她。
Well the princess may not find me memorable, but I'll never forget her.

621
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:03,516
我特别喜欢那件高领的裙子和……
I especially liked the dress with the high neck collar and...

622
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:06,209
迪林上校，这是怎么回事?
Colonel Deering, what is this all about?

623
00:47:06,538 --> 00:47:07,581
你为什么在这里?
Why are you here?

624
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:10,737
这个地区的海盗势力是最厉害的。
The pirate forces are at their worst in this sector.

625
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,009
我们带了船来确保你的安全到达。
We brought our ships to assure you safe arrival.

626
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:24,313
<我>警报!警报!警告! < / i >
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

627
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,213
<i>龙受到敌对船只的攻击。</i>
<i>Draconia under attack by hostile ships.</i>

628
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:28,385
罗杰斯和队长……
And Captain Rogers...

629
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:30,898
所有人员到防御岗位去。
All personnel to defense posts.

630
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:35,621
船员们，上你们的船去!-通知所有电台。安全的船。
- Men, to your ships! - Alert all stations. Secure the ship.

631
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:38,591
这就是你们要求我们安全行事的方式。
So this is how you bid us safe conduct.

632
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:42,000
找到护航。至少我们会一起死亡。
Find escort. At least we'll all perish together.

633
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:51,914
<i>清除所有攻击发射通道</i>
<i>Clear all launch channels for attack.</i>

634
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,543
<我>警报!警告! < / i >
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

635
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:44,819
解雇,银行!我抓到你的尾巴了。
Lay off, Bank! I got your tail.

636
00:48:46,162 --> 00:48:47,603
拉起!我要打断他。
Pull up! I'll cut him off.

637
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:52,493
没有这些超能力你是不可能潜水的!
There's no way you're diving without any of those powers!

638
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:59,568
罗杰斯上尉，我命令你不要插手此事。
Captain Rogers, I ordered you to stay out of this.

639
00:48:59,805 --> 00:49:01,448
中校，你需要所有能得到的帮助。
Colonel, you need all the help you can get.

640
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:08,854
——翼人!12点钟方向的人。- 12点什么?
- Wing man! Man at 12 o'clock high. - 12 o'clock what?

641
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,076
中尉忿怒,漠视。罗杰斯上尉，别再广播了。
Lieutenant Wrather, disregard. Captain Rogers, get off the air.

642
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:16,123
我们的作战电脑在你前面。
Our combat computers are way ahead of you.

643
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:19,186
是的，上校，但如果你的电脑运行不快…
Well yeah Colonel, but if your computers don't do something pretty fast...

644
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,869
你的副手宁可…
your lieutenant Wrather is going to be...

645
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,498
瑟隆伯利小心!
Watch out, Thornberry!

646
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:32,901
中校，你必须手动飞行。
Colonel, you've got to go to manual flight.

647
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,416
巴克·罗杰斯，如果你继续分散我们飞行员的注意力……
Buck Rogers, if you don't stop distracting our pilots...

648
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:38,652
你只有一个中尉和两个海盗在跟踪你。
You just have a lieutenant and a couple of pirates on your tail.

649
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,678
中校，我要换手动。
Colonel, I'm switching to manual.

650
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,951
看看我能不能把我们一直在做的事情讲出来。
See if I can start dishing out a little of what we've been taking.

651
00:49:46,058 --> 00:49:48,143
巴克·罗杰斯，我命令你回基地。
Buck Rogers, I'm ordering you back to the base.

652
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:56,114
钉他…让我们看看他有多喜欢老式的红地毯。
Nailed him... let's see how he like a little old fashion red dogging.

653
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:18,494
一个袋子。六要走。
One sack. Six to go.

654
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,230
有你!
Got you!

655
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:46,297
上校。拿下来。直接向下，进入复古!
Colonel. Take it down. Straight down and enter retro!

656
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,452
我不能!这违背了现代空战的原则。
I can't! It goes against the principles of modern aerial combat.

657
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:03,962
这叫做把你的中后卫绑在一起。
That's called bunching your linebackers.

658
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:14,424
看!我不知道我们的战斗计算机出了什么问题，但是…
Look! I don't know what went wrong with our combat computers but...

659
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:16,500
谢谢你！
thank you.

660
00:51:17,135 --> 00:51:19,834
现在，船长，我们回家吧。
Now, captain, let's go home.

661
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:24,227
-是我的还是你的?——什么?
- Mine or is it yours? - What?

662
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:26,109
-你说什么?——只是在开玩笑。
- What did you say? - Just joking.

663
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:28,267
空管1进入。
Air control 1 to access.

664
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:32,530
走廊1-0允许来客进入。
Clear on Corridor 1-0 Able for incoming vessel.

665
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,624
证实。外部障碍已清除，可以接近…
Confirmed. Outer barrier is all clear for approach...

666
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:42,706
在走廊1-0上，可容纳进港船只。
on Corridor 1-0 Able for incoming vessel.

667
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:52,338
上校-迪尔岭。你看见罗杰斯上尉了吗?
Colonel Deering. Have you seen Captain Rogers?

668
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,703
是的。为什么?
Yes. Why?

669
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:57,885
我们的御前会议收到了阿达拉公主陛下的正式请求。
Our Council has had a formal request from Her Majesty Princess Ardala.

670
00:51:58,856 --> 00:52:00,642
那和船长有什么关系?
What has that got to do with the captain?

671
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,917
公主觉得他独自拯救了…
Well, the princess feels he single-handedly saved...

672
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:05,191
他们的手无寸铁的船来自反叛的海盗…
their unarmed vessel from the renegade pirates...

673
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:07,124
想亲自感谢他。
and wants to thank him personally.

674
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:08,595
一手吗?
Single-handedly?

675
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:11,786
显然，连你的飞船也差点被毁。
Apparently, even your ship was nearly destroyed.

676
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,413
如果不是罗杰斯船长过分的技巧……
Were if not for Captain Rogers' inordinate skills...

677
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:16,569
公主想了想，觉得……
and quick thinking, the princess feels...

678
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,530
我才不管公主怎么想呢。
I don't care what the princess feels.

679
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:20,695
我知道发生了什么事。我在那里。
I know what happened. I was there.

680
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,570
明天我将征服地球。
Tomorrow I conquer Earth.

681
00:52:28,694 --> 00:52:31,667
明天我们将征服地球，殿下。
Tomorrow we conquer Earth, your Highness.

682
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:58,591
你看起来真棒，巴克。
You look magnificent, Buck.

683
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,862
有什么事困扰你吗?
Is something troubling you?

684
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:04,648
为什么我会被邀请参加这个活动?没有人相信我。
Why am I invited to this thing? Nobody believes me.

685
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:07,189
阿达拉公主想亲自感谢你
Princess Ardala wants to thank you personally

686
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:09,031
因为她在船上打击海盗。
for fighting the pirates off her ship.

687
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:13,182
我自己也跟她说了一两句话……一个人。
And I'd had a word or two with her myself... alone.

688
00:53:13,263 --> 00:53:15,261
哦!(我肯定这是不允许的。)
Oh! I'm sure that won't be permitted.

689
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,912
毕竟，你只是个上尉。
After all, you're only a captain.

690
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:20,239
甚至没有被委任。
And not even commissioned at that.

691
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:24,656
你们有什么治头痛的药?——头痛?你病了吗，巴克?
- What have you got for headache? - A headache? Are you ill, Buck?

692
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:27,377
哦!我想我只是还没从长途旅行中完全恢复过来。
Oh! I guess I'm just not fully recovered from that long trip yet.

693
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:31,430
你为什么不早说?Twiki会帮你弄点放松药。
Why didn't you say something? Twiki will get you a relaxant.

694
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,566
好了，现在该进去了。
Well, it's time to go in now.

695
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:37,162
我们可不想让贸易代表团久等。
We don't want to keep the trade delegation waiting.

696
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:02,591
受欢迎的。严厉的贸易代表团…
Welcome. The Draconian trade delegation...

697
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:04,681
在女王殿下的领导下……
under the leadership of Her Royal Highness...

698
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,719
王国的王储公主。Ardala。
Crown Princess of the realm. Ardala.

699
00:54:10,692 --> 00:54:13,847
在这历史性的时刻，我向你们致以问候。
I bring you greetings on this historic occasion.

700
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:16,778
我父亲，德拉科国王……
My father, King Draco...

701
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:20,347
向你展示他自己的旗舰龙onia…
would like to present to you his own flagship Draconia...

702
00:54:20,618 --> 00:54:22,760
充满了所有最新的技术…
filled with all the latest technology...

703
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,584
作为礼物，象征着一个新的辉煌时代…
as a gift to symbolize a new glorious era...

704
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:27,998
商业与和平。
of commerce and peace.

705
00:54:32,283 --> 00:54:34,118
庆祝活动开始吧。
Let the celebration begin.

706
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:52,903
-我们给你带了些药，巴克——嗯?
- We brought you some pills, Buck. - Hmm?

707
00:54:53,392 --> 00:54:56,961
你的头痛。这是一种非常强效的松弛剂。
For your headache. It's a very strong relaxant.

708
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:59,484
你一次只能拿一个。
You mustn't take more than one at a time.

709
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,339
谢谢你的家伙。
Thanks guys.

710
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:05,475
嗯，我知道舞蹈在500年里有了很大的发展。
Well, I see dancing has come a long way in 500 years.

711
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,539
听。我还需要别的东西。玫瑰。
Listen. I'm going to need something else. A rose.

712
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,655
-你是说玫瑰吗?-对，红色的。
- Did you say a rose? - Yeah, a red one.

713
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,017
巴克，你要玫瑰做什么?
What do you need a rose for, Buck?

714
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:24,788
Twiki，你能快点给我拿一个来吗?
Twiki, would you go get me one, quickly huh?

715
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,800
罗杰斯船长，你觉得我们的简报怎么样?
How do you like our presentation, Captain Rogers?

716
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:40,363
最令人印象深刻的。
Most impressive.

717
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:46,033
这种民间舞蹈是从她父亲的世界来的吗?
Did this folk dance come all the way from her daddy's world?

718
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:50,024
对不起，我想我不明白你的条件。
Sorry, I don't think I understand your terms.

719
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:54,174
我建议你用一个比“爸爸”更有礼貌的称呼。
And I would suggest a more respectful reference than "daddy".

720
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:57,178
他也许是世界上最伟大的领导人。
He's perhaps the greatest leader the world has ever known.

721
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,551
提醒你一句，上校。
Well, a word of caution, Colonel.

722
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:04,279
-当心带礼物的希腊人。——希腊人?
- Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. - Greeks?

723
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:08,406
也许那比你的时代早一点。很久以前了。
Maybe that was a little before your time. Quite a while back.

724
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:12,215
告诉我，你知道特洛伊木马的故事吗?
Tell me, do you know the story of the Trojan horse?

725
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:14,720
不。
No.

726
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:17,218
不,是吧?好吧,忘了它吧。
No, huh? Well, forget it.

727
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:19,941
我想我来自一个绝望的多疑时代。
I guess I came from a time that was hopelessly paranoid.

728
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:21,456
在见到你。
See you around.

729
00:56:27,856 --> 00:56:29,138
你的玫瑰,巴克。
Your rose, Buck.

730
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,244
哦!它很漂亮。谢谢你,Twiki。
Oh! It's a nice one. Thank you, Twiki.

731
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:34,865
巴克，没有其他人给公主送花。
Buck, no one else is giving the princess flowers.

732
00:56:34,952 --> 00:56:36,769
你会让他们看起来很可笑的。
You're going to make them all look ridiculous.

733
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:38,655
保持密切联系。我们下一个。
Stay close fellows. We're next.

734
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:50,981
罗杰斯上尉。祝贺你们，谢谢你们。
Well, Captain Rogers. Congratulations and thank you.

735
00:56:51,302 --> 00:56:54,975
我们非常感谢你把我们从那些可怕的私掠船手中救了出来。
We're very grateful to you for saving us from those horrible privateers.

736
00:56:56,821 --> 00:56:58,316
不要太大声，我的公主。
Not too loud, my Princess.

737
00:56:58,337 --> 00:57:01,429
这里的人都以为我是私掠船船长。多亏了你。
Around here they think I am a privateer. Thanks to you.

738
00:57:01,982 --> 00:57:05,501
我吗?好吧，我希望我没有给你带来太多的尴尬。
Me? Well, I hope I haven't caused you too much embarrassment.

739
00:57:05,703 --> 00:57:07,664
-你生气了吗?-我代表…
- Are you angry? - On behalf of the...

740
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:11,050
——西奥!-多好的身体啊。
- Theo! - What a body.

741
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:17,204
-从我到你。-你那个可爱的小朋友是谁?
- From me to you. - Who's your charming little friend?

742
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:19,033
他的名字叫Twiki。
His name is Twiki.

743
00:57:20,055 --> 00:57:22,382
是的，他脖子上挂的那个东西是西奥…
Yes, and that thing hanging around his neck is Theo...

744
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:24,763
电脑委员会当然成员。
Ex-officio member of the Computer Council.

745
00:57:24,784 --> 00:57:26,025
陛下。
Your Majesty.

746
00:57:26,046 --> 00:57:27,622
你愿意和我跳下一个舞吗?
Would you care to join me in the next dance?

747
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:31,476
-公主不会…-不介意跳舞。
- The princess does not... - Does not mind to dance.

748
00:58:01,093 --> 00:58:03,316
我不太熟悉这些最新的舞步。
I don't think I'm too up on these latest dance steps.

749
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,792
好吧，如果你有偏好…这是我的派对。
Well, if you have a preference... It is my party.

750
00:58:05,911 --> 00:58:07,877
真的。来点老派的怎么样?
Really. How about something old-fashioned, huh?

751
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:12,653
先生,对不起。你熟悉……吗?摇滚吗?你知道的…
Sir, excuse me. Are you familiar with... rock? You know...

752
00:58:14,072 --> 00:58:15,477
试试看，试试看。来吧。
Try it, try it. Come on.

753
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:21,360
不，不，不是这样的。让自己去吧。
No, no, that's not it. Just let yourself go.

754
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:23,109
让它去吧。跟着音乐走。
Let it go. Go with the music.

755
00:58:23,377 --> 00:58:24,420
这是正确的。是的。
That's right. Yeah.

756
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:36,585
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

757
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:40,114
这叫做下坠。如果你害怕的话，这比你的年龄要早一点……
It's called getting down. It's a little before your time, if it frightens you...

758
00:58:42,396 --> 00:58:43,800
我什么都不害怕。
Nothing frightens me.

759
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:46,228
是的很好。下来跳舞。
Yeah it's fine. Get down and boogie.

760
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:12,788
它是表达。
It's expressive.

761
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:15,077
很恶心!
It's disgusting!

762
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:21,154
-如果我们撞到一起会怎么样?-我们自动成为夫妻。
- What happens if we bump together? - We automatically become man and wife.

763
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:24,809
Groovy。下来。
Groovy. Get down.

764
00:59:26,477 --> 00:59:28,522
你真了不起，罗杰斯船长。
You're quite a man, Captain Rogers.

765
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:31,517
我觉得地球人相信你的故事…
I have the feeling the earth people believe your incredible story...

766
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:34,139
被冻结了500年
about being frozen for 500 years.

767
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:38,141
-绝对不行。他们认为我是间谍。-我的一个?
- Not on your life. They think I'm a spy. - One of mine?

768
00:59:39,387 --> 00:59:41,957
-他们不确定。-你想加入我们吗?
- They're not sure. - You want to join us?

769
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:45,696
-我得去找谁才能采取行动?——我。
- Who do I gotta see to make my move? - Me.

770
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:50,631
告诉我，那栋楼…还是通讯中心吗?
Tell me, that building... Is it still the communications center?

771
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:54,041
那是机密信息。
That would be secret information.

772
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:56,038
当然可以。
Of course.

773
00:59:58,048 --> 01:00:00,045
我永远是你们中的一员，胡尔博士。
I will always be one of you, Dr. Huer.

774
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:03,445
也许我会留在这里……永久。
Perhaps I will remain here... permanently.

775
01:00:03,648 --> 01:00:05,126
我们希望如此。
We hope so.

776
01:00:23,158 --> 01:00:26,457
殿下，有些大臣想占用几分钟。
Your Highness, some of ministers would like a few minutes.

777
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:30,087
——后,凯恩。-王国的事业是第一位的!
- Later, Kane. - Business of the realm comes first!

778
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:34,022
你父亲希望你为国家服务。
Your father expects you to serve the best interests of the realm.

779
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:35,665
如果你不…
If you don't...

780
01:00:36,036 --> 01:00:39,330
他还有29个女儿也会嫁给他!
he has 29 other daughters that will!

781
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:51,214
这是我们的荣幸，罗杰斯船长，但恐怕我们的任务太艰巨了。
It's been a pleasure, Captain Rogers, but I'm afraid our duties are cut out for us.

782
01:00:53,164 --> 01:00:54,496
也许以后?
Later perhaps?

783
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,946
午夜时分，我乘私人汽艇离开。
I depart aboard my private launch at midnight.

784
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:00,740
我就会与你同在。
I'll be there.

785
01:01:07,303 --> 01:01:08,941
罗杰斯上尉。
Captain Rogers.

786
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:12,683
我不知道现在和你谈话是不是很合适。
I wonder if this wouldn't be a good time to talk with you.

787
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,810
阿达拉公主突然离开……
Princess Ardala left so abruptly...

788
01:01:15,832 --> 01:01:17,922
派对似乎要结束了。
and the party seems to be over.

789
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:20,316
你没有任何计划，是吗?
You don't have any plans, do you?

790
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:22,984
——嗯…——好。
- Well... - Good.

791
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,803
我有些话想说。
I have something I would like to say.

792
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,073
好吧,我……
Well, I...

793
01:01:27,095 --> 01:01:29,731
我以为你是间谍，罗杰斯船长。
I thought you were a spy, Captain Rogers.

794
01:01:32,077 --> 01:01:33,558
我错了。
I was wrong.

795
01:01:57,182 --> 01:01:59,487
你想去别的地方吗?
Would you like to go some place?

796
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,768
我还没准备好。
I'm not up to that yet.

797
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:06,626
我已经有一段时间没有工作了……
I have been out of it for quite a while...

798
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,026
500年。
500 years.

799
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:11,793
我在重返大气层时可得小心了。
I've got to go easy on reentry.

800
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:34,198
它是好的。
It's alright.

801
01:02:35,032 --> 01:02:36,861
现在听她说，伙计。她的意义。
Now listen to her, fella. She's making sense.

802
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,581
我已经邀请罗杰斯船长加入我们。
I've asked Captain Rogers to join us.

803
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:42,665
你真幸运，她打电话给我。
Lucky for you she called me on.

804
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:56,871
我们差不多了。
We're almost there.

805
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,072
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

806
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:02,881
我知道天很冷，但我们别无选择。
I know it's chilly, but we've got no choice.

807
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:05,395
我们的命令是紧盯巴克。
Our orders are to stay close to Buck.

808
01:03:05,706 --> 01:03:08,617
他可能需要我们，所以回到冷藏箱里。
And he may need us, so back in the cooler.

809
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,347
Twiki，我在跟你说话呢。
Twiki, I'm speaking to you.

810
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:16,492
噢!把我的滚珠冻掉了。
Ooh! Freezing my ball bearings off.

811
01:03:20,979 --> 01:03:23,776
就是找不到罗杰斯船长。
Captain Rogers is just not to be found.

812
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,183
你对原始人有什么期待?
What do you expect from a primitive?

813
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:28,473
(有消息我们会通知你的。)
We'll let you know if we hear anything.

814
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,796
你是个间谍，巴克·罗杰斯……
You are a spy, Buck Rogers...

815
01:03:34,585 --> 01:03:36,970
我知道你在哪里。
and I know exactly where you are.

816
01:03:49,854 --> 01:03:50,902
出去!
Out!

817
01:03:58,203 --> 01:04:00,419
如果你把它们修好，它们会成为更好的宠物。
They make better pets if you had them fixed.

818
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,896
让我们找个舒服的地方。给我们倒杯喝的。
Let's make ourselves comfortable. Pour us a drink.

819
01:04:13,586 --> 01:04:14,924
我们终于单独在一起了。
At last we're alone.

820
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,536
你有什么要说的吗?
Have you nothing to say?

821
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:40,052
直到这一刻，我才知道我错过了什么。
Up until this moment I didn't know what it was I'd been missing.

822
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:42,530
我也有件事要坦白。
Well, I have a confession as well.

823
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,492
有人在家。
There's somebody else back home.

824
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:47,662
我没有意识到我错过了什么。
I didn't realized what I was missing.

825
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:50,105
你是不同的。
You're different.

826
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:52,564
你是傲慢。
You're arrogant.

827
01:04:52,793 --> 01:04:54,897
你公然违抗命令。
You flagrantly disregard orders.

828
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:58,030
而你是那种能让我父亲下台的人。
And you're the kind of man who could unseat my father.

829
01:04:58,157 --> 01:05:00,773
你父亲的座位是我最不可能想到的。
Your father's seat is the furthest thing from my mind.

830
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,137
我带你来这里是有原因的。
I brought you here for a reason.

831
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:04,522
我正指望着呢。
I was counting on that.

832
01:05:05,859 --> 01:05:07,300
我希望你在我身边。
I want you by my side.

833
01:05:07,851 --> 01:05:09,896
那并不是我想要的。
That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

834
01:05:11,593 --> 01:05:12,633
考虑。
Consider it.

835
01:05:13,194 --> 01:05:17,096
你不知道作为征服者德拉科的女儿是什么感觉。
You have no idea what it's like being the daughter of Draco the Conqueror.

836
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:20,236
29个姐妹跟在你身后。
29 sisters living at your heels.

837
01:05:22,324 --> 01:05:25,321
像凯恩这样狡猾的小朝臣们争夺权力。
Weasely little courtiers like Kane vying for power.

838
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:30,350
但是和男人在一起……像你这样的男子汉……
But with a man... a real man like yourself...

839
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:36,121
我可以违抗父亲，我可以过我自己的生活。
I could defy my father, I could live my own life.

840
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:37,578
哦?
Oh?

841
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,684
一个宏伟的新王朝。
A magnificent new dynasty.

842
01:05:39,879 --> 01:05:41,606
我们是不是有点超前了?
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?

843
01:05:42,268 --> 01:05:43,736
我现在就喝那杯。
I'll take that drink now.

844
01:05:58,647 --> 01:06:00,032
我们必须非常小心。
We have to be very careful.

845
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:01,703
——我们?-嗯嗯。
- Do we? - Mm hm.

846
01:06:02,985 --> 01:06:04,581
时机不是很好。
The timing is not good.

847
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:08,075
事情永远不会改变。一直都是这样。
Things never change. This is the way it's always been.

848
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:12,008
为什么我不能早点遇见你呢，巴克·罗杰斯?
Why couldn't I have met you sooner, Buck Rogers?

849
01:06:12,128 --> 01:06:13,858
嗯，我们有足够的时间，不是吗?
Well, we've got plenty of time, don't we?

850
01:06:22,993 --> 01:06:27,014
所有武器人员到飞行室报到开始装填武器。
All armament personnel report to flight bay to begin loading weaponry.

851
01:06:27,036 --> 01:06:29,359
看看他们。在那里睡觉。
Look at them. Down there sleeping.

852
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,188
傻瓜永远不会知道发生了什么。
The fools will never know what happened.

853
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:36,852
我如此放松。请你关灯好吗?
I so relaxed. Would you turn off the lights?

854
01:06:54,787 --> 01:06:56,832
如果你是间谍，我就得杀了你。
If you're a spy, I'll have to kill you.

855
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:01,350
如果这是你最擅长的枕边谈话，我想我发现了你的问题。
If that's an example of your best pillow-talk, I think I found your problem.

856
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,117
这样不好，特威奇。
This is no good, Twiki.

857
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:22,511
到处都是士兵……
There are soldiers everywhere...

858
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:25,732
我们甚至不知道从哪里开始寻找罗杰斯船长。
and we don't even know where to begin to look for Captain Rogers.

859
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,228
天啊!
Holy gee!

860
01:08:05,432 --> 01:08:07,677
我们看看能不能找到你的睡衣。
Let's see if we can find your jammies now.

861
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:34,347
海盗船只。这就是他们如何能够攻击我们。
The pirate ships. So that's how they were able to attack us.

862
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:36,125
那是他们自己的人民。
It was their own people.

863
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:15,231
-老虎侠在哪里?-我不知道，先生
- Where's Tiger Man? - I don't know, sir.

864
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:27,885
走开!
Go away!

865
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,522
他们吵醒你了吗，亲爱的?
Did they wake you, my darling?

866
01:09:35,684 --> 01:09:38,658
他们吵醒你了吗，我的小王子?
Did they wake you, my little baby prince?

867
01:09:40,762 --> 01:09:41,925
爆炸了!
Blast it!

868
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:48,069
把它弄出来!把它弄出来!把它弄出来!执行他!
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out! Execute him!

869
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:52,690
——没有。把他带走审问。-你取消我的订单?
- No. Remove him for questioning. - You countermand my order?

870
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,846
在这种情况下，是的。
Under the circumstances, yes.

871
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:56,858
照我说的做。
Do as I say.

872
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:00,011
带他。
Take him.

873
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:11,842
你可得好好解释一番。
You have a lot of explaining to do.

874
01:10:11,926 --> 01:10:13,923
我得向你解释一下?
I have some explaining to do?

875
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:16,843
不是Gucci，但管他呢!
Well, it's not Gucci, but what the hell!

876
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:28,311
我也不想被抓住。
I don't want to get caught either.

877
01:10:28,685 --> 01:10:32,002
但是有些东西很不对劲，我们必须找出它是什么。
But something is very wrong and we've got to find out what it is.

878
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:36,509
我希望你知道这违反了我的保证。
I hope you know this violates my warranty.

879
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:40,655
很明显你已经…关注。
You have quite obviously been... preoccupied.

880
01:10:41,026 --> 01:10:43,822
你无礼的行为我以后再跟你算账。
I will deal with you for your insolence later.

881
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:46,003
下令立即进攻。
Give the order to attack at once.

882
01:10:46,192 --> 01:10:49,472
没有你父亲的军队支持，我们无法进攻。
We cannot attack without your father's forces to support us.

883
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,585
凯恩,你懦弱!
Kane, you're spineless!

884
01:10:51,805 --> 01:10:55,801
我们不需要我父亲。我们有惊喜的元素。
We do not need my father. We have the element of surprise.

885
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:59,360
我们可以摧毁内城。我们可以摧毁防御盾。
We can wipe out the Inner City. We can destroy the defense shield.

886
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,670
等我父亲的军队到达时…
By the time my father's forces arrive...

887
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:03,738
我们将坐在地球的王座上。
we'll be sitting on the throne of the Earth.

888
01:11:04,107 --> 01:11:07,105
至少我会的，因为你显然没有勇气。
At least I will, since you obviously don't have the nerve.

889
01:11:09,885 --> 01:11:13,361
好吧，我们进攻。
Alright, we will attack.

890
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,203
一个明智的决定，凯恩。
A wise decision, Kane.

891
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:20,790
与此同时，罗杰斯船长还在这艘船上的某个地方。
Meanwhile, Captain Rogers is loose somewhere on this ship.

892
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,083
找到他。
Find him.

893
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,228
<我>警报!警告! < / i >
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

894
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,989
<i>外来入侵者在船上。</i>
<i>Outside intruder aboard ship.</i>

895
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:32,918
<我>警报!警报!警告! < / i >
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

896
01:11:35,861 --> 01:11:36,861
这是巴克。
It's Buck.

897
01:11:36,945 --> 01:11:39,870
我看到他。他穿着敌人的制服。
I see him. He's wearing the uniform of the enemy.

898
01:11:46,204 --> 01:11:48,506
好吧，这可以温暖你的尾巴。
Well, this will warm your tail.

899
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:57,116
那些是军舰。这意味着条约是一个骗局。
Those are warships out there. That means the treaty is a hoax.

900
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,996
但是我们可以为我们的国家做最后的贡献。
But we can do one last service for our country.

901
01:12:00,971 --> 01:12:03,490
我们可以对付罗杰斯上尉。
We can deal with Captain Rogers.

902
01:12:06,106 --> 01:12:09,104
还有六分钟进攻倒计时。
Six minutes to attack and counting.

903
01:12:23,118 --> 01:12:26,149
五分钟后开始进攻。
Five minutes to attack and counting.

904
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:31,289
-别动，罗杰斯船长。- Theo, Twiki，你们在这里做什么?
- Don't move, Captain Rogers. - Theo, Twiki, what are you doing here?

905
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:33,696
这对任何人来说都不愉快。
This isn't going to be pleasant for anyone.

906
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:35,940
你们能不能出去?我有工作要做。
Will you guy get out of here? I got work to do.

907
01:12:36,002 --> 01:12:39,719
-我们看得出来，你这个叛徒。-你看不出来是怎么回事吗?
- We can see that, you traitor. - Can't you see what's happening?

908
01:12:39,866 --> 01:12:42,623
我会说有人要炸地球了。
I'd say someone is about to bomb Earth.

909
01:12:42,645 --> 01:12:43,872
你认识这些船吗?
Do you recognize these ships?

910
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:45,744
不，但我不明白这有什么重要的……
No, but I don't see how that's very important...

911
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:47,118
他们是海盗船。
They're pirate ships.

912
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,464
为什么会有海盗船在严酷的旗舰上?
Why would there be pirate ships aboard the Draconian flagship?

913
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:54,274
我很抱歉。你应该做得更好。现在跟我们走吧。
I'm sorry. You'll have to do better than that. Now come with us.

914
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:56,257
- 4分钟进攻和计时。——没有。
- 4 minutes to attack and counting. - No.

915
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:59,149
看!你这半生不熟的电子呓语，
Look! You half baked load of electronic gibberish,

916
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,477
我不指望你知道所有的事情……
I don't expect you to know everything...

917
01:13:00,499 --> 01:13:03,478
但是你听说过把炸弹装进火箭船的尾管里吗?
but have you ever heard of loading bombs into the tail pipe of a rocket ship?

918
01:13:04,636 --> 01:13:07,715
你安静点，Twiki。我都被弄糊涂了。
You be quiet, Twiki. I'm getting confused.

919
01:13:07,935 --> 01:13:09,648
也许我能帮你解惑。
Maybe I can help unconfuse you.

920
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:11,637
根本就没有海盗船。没有。
There are no pirate ships. There never were.

921
01:13:12,028 --> 01:13:14,498
他们是伪装成掠夺者的严酷的轰炸机。
They are Draconian bombers disguised as marauders.

922
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,145
他们一直在骚扰你们的航道
They've been harassing your shipping lanes

923
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:18,354
以迫使你与德古尼亚签订条约。
in order to force you into a treaty with Draconia.

924
01:13:19,673 --> 01:13:22,149
当然!如果这是真的，那很巧妙。
Of course! It's ingenious, if true.

925
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:24,420
<i>三分钟攻击和计数。</i>
<i>Three minutes to attack and counting.</i>

926
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,565
你有10秒钟的时间来决定你相信谁。我或者凯恩。
You got about 10 seconds to make up your mind who you believe in. Me or Kane.

927
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,193
——一些选择。-你自己呢?
- Some choice. - And what about yourself?

928
01:13:30,687 --> 01:13:32,258
难道你的电路没有告诉你，我是正常的吗?
Don't your circuits tell you, I'm on the level?

929
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,071
是的。
Yes.

930
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:35,289
好吧，除非你想把自己当成别人的零件，
Alright, unless you want to consider yourself somebody's spare parts,

931
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:37,015
你为什么不跟着你最初的直觉走呢?
why don't you go along with your initial instincts.

932
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:41,205
好吧。但前提是你要帮我们找到通讯员…
Alright. But only on the condition you help us get to a communicator...

933
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,526
这样我们就能警告内城了。
so we can warn Inner City.

934
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:45,446
好吧，你得自己去做。
Well, you have to do that on your own.

935
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,950
如果你没能成功
On the chance that if you don't make it,

936
01:13:46,971 --> 01:13:48,877
我得确保这些飞船都没准备好下水。
I got to make sure none of these ships are ready to launch.

937
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:52,094
指挥官凯恩。我发现3号湾有个警卫不省人事。
Commander Kane. I found a guard unconscious in Bay 3.

938
01:13:53,519 --> 01:13:56,462
- 2分钟攻击和计数。-找个地方躲起来，西奥。
- 2 minutes to attack and counting. - Find somewhere to hide, Theo.

939
01:13:56,484 --> 01:13:58,347
他们找到了被我打晕的警卫。现在离开这里。
They found the guard I knocked out. Now get out of here.

940
01:13:58,369 --> 01:14:01,419
好吧。好吧。我们会尽力的。祝你好运,巴克。
Alright. Alright. We'll do our part. Good luck, Buck.

941
01:14:19,499 --> 01:14:22,245
带我去控制台，Twiki。
Take me over to the console, Twiki.

942
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,350
现在，抓住中间的面板。
Now, grab the middle panel.

943
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:30,364
- 90秒攻击和计数。——放弃。
- Ninety seconds to attack and counting. - Drop it.

944
01:14:31,348 --> 01:14:33,710
抓住电路，拉动它们。
Grab the circuits and pull them.

<i>80秒攻击和计数。</i>

950
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:06,107
请进。
Come in, please.

951
01:15:08,193 --> 01:15:09,277
上校在线-迪尔岭。
Colonel Deering online.

952
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,726
我是Theopolis医生。
This is Dr. Theopolis.

953
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:12,911
是的医生。你在哪里?
Yes doctor. Where are you?

954
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:14,751
你是怎么接通这个紧急频道的?
How did you get on this emergency channel?

955
01:15:14,773 --> 01:15:16,954
我在龙onia号旗舰上。
I'm on board the flagship Draconia.

956
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,326
我听从罗杰斯船长的吩咐，跟在他后面。现在请仔细听。
I followed Captain Rogers as ordered. Now please listen.

957
01:15:20,499 --> 01:15:23,955
德龙尼亚不是……重复，不是没有武器的船。
The Draconia is not... repeat, not an unarmed vessel.

958
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,029
她满是准备发射的轰炸机…
She is filled with bombers preparing to launch...

959
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:28,863
对内城的全面军事攻击。
a full-scale military attack against the Inner City.

960
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:31,948
但如何?它们从哪里来?他们的登陆场空无一人。
But how? Where did they come from? Their landing bay was empty.

961
01:15:32,191 --> 01:15:34,617
紧急起飞你的战斗机中队，马上!在一次!
Scramble your fighter squadrons now! At once!

962
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,541
谢谢你医生。祝你好运。

01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:13,443
四个,三个……
Four, three...

971
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:15,890
两个,一个。
two, one.

972
01:16:16,106 --> 01:16:17,257
攻击!
Attack!

973
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,309
它是什么?这是怎么呢
What is it? What's going on?

974
01:16:36,233 --> 01:16:39,364
——我们的船只。他们只是爆炸了。——这是不可能的!
- Our ships. They simply exploded. - That's impossible!

975
01:16:53,103 --> 01:16:54,524
这里是地球理事会。
This is Earth Directorate.

976
01:16:54,546 --> 01:16:57,240
攻击起飞的轰炸机。我们将攻击主船。
Attack bombers as they launch. We'll attack the main ship.

977
01:16:59,935 --> 01:17:02,917
没有轰炸机可以攻击。它们一出现就爆炸了。
There are no bombers to attack. They're exploding as they emerge.

978
01:17:03,482 --> 01:17:04,775
那没有任何意义。
That doesn't makes any sense.

979
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:07,946
把我们的战舰派出去!
Get our warships out there!

980
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:20,803
准备拦截。我重复一遍，不要使用作战计算机。
Prepare to intercept. Do not, I repeat, do not use combat computers.

981
01:17:20,894 --> 01:17:21,937
分离。
Disengaging.

982
01:17:24,955 --> 01:17:27,256
德龙尼亚在你的翅膀上。银行对吧!我要得到他!
Draconia on your wing. Bank right! I'll get him!

983
01:17:47,716 --> 01:17:50,528
有两个从下面上来。我要跳过最上面的那个。
We got two coming up from below. I'll jump the one on the top.

984
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,098
我得到了另一个。
I've got the other one.

985
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:34,837
拿着那个和那个!
Take that and that!

986
01:18:36,698 --> 01:18:37,662
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

987
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:52,189
好吧!对海湾造成的任何损坏，我要让你负责。
Alright! I'm going to hold you responsible for any damage done to this bay.

988
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:17,139
我真的很抱歉事情发展到这一步。
I'm really sorry it had to come to this.

989
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:26,458
干杯!
Bottoms up!

990
01:19:29,148 --> 01:19:32,509
准备传送德拉科国王的人像。
Prepare to transmit Person-Image of King Draco.

991
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:36,504
以王国的名义，这到底是怎么回事?
What, in the name of the realm, is going on?

992
01:19:36,589 --> 01:19:40,619
你在我的船还在几小时之外的时候进攻?
You are attacking while my ships are still hours away?

993
01:19:40,707 --> 01:19:43,139
我…只是服从命令。
I'm... just following orders.

994
01:19:43,332 --> 01:19:46,801
那你到底是听从谁的命令呢?
And just whose orders were you following?

995
01:19:47,303 --> 01:19:48,686
先生,你的女儿。
Your daughter, sir.

996
01:19:48,707 --> 01:19:53,528
她是命令我们的船只在进入战斗时解体吗?
And did she order our ships to disintegrate as they enter battle?

997
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:58,488
如果你们有谁能在这场我们国家所知的最大灾难中幸存下来……
If either of you survive this greatest debacle our realm has known...

998
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,720
你要回答我!
You will answer to me!

999
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:08,661
所有中队，脱离战舰，
All squadron, disengage from fighting warships,

1000
01:20:08,683 --> 01:20:10,726
准备完成这艘母舰。
and prepare to finish off the mother-craft.

1001
01:20:25,808 --> 01:20:27,367
紧急! <我> < / i >
<i>Emergency!</i>

1002
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:32,663
<我>紧急!紧急!紧急! < / i >
<i>Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1003
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:35,274
这是你干的，殿下。
This was your doing, your Highness.

1004
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:39,448
我应该把你留在这里和船一起烧掉……
I oughta leave you here to burn up with the ship...

1005
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,604
但我要你活着回答你父亲的问题。
But I want you alive to answer to your father.

1006
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:45,672
我有一架紧急逃生飞船，准备好了。
I have an emergency escape shuttle, ready to leave now.

1007
01:20:47,353 --> 01:20:50,427
它能带我们走到足够远的地方到你父亲的船。
It'll take us far enough away to reach your father's ship.

1008
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:57,217
<我>紧急!紧急!紧急! < / i >
<i>Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1009
01:21:07,213 --> 01:21:08,499
紧急! <我> < / i >
<i>Emergency!</i>

1010
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,973
<我>紧急!紧急! < / i >
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1011
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:18,924
这艘船随时要爆炸了。
The ship is ready to blow.

1012
01:21:19,214 --> 01:21:23,092
把所有船只撤出撞击区域。西奥，我来接你和特威基。
Withdraw all ships from the impact area. Theo, I'm coming in to get you and Twiki.

1013
01:21:23,113 --> 01:21:25,510
——忘记我们。保存。——巴克?
- Forget us. Save Buck. - Buck?

1014
01:21:25,532 --> 01:21:29,130
威尔玛，他单枪匹马摧毁了他们的舰队。
Wilma, he single-handedly destroyed their entire fleet of warships.

1015
01:21:29,152 --> 01:21:32,397
-他派我们来警告你。-在飞行甲板上见。
- He sent us to warn you. - Meet me there on the flight deck.

1016
01:21:32,683 --> 01:21:33,814
我要去找巴克。
I'm going to find Buck.

1017
01:21:40,566 --> 01:21:43,478
<我>紧急!紧急!紧急! < / i >
<i>Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1018
01:21:45,164 --> 01:21:46,679
Theo, Twiki，过来!
Theo, Twiki, over here!

1019
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:50,954
很高兴再次见到你，巴克。
It's good to see you again, Buck.

1020
01:21:51,444 --> 01:21:54,219
是啊，省掉那些繁文缛节。这本杂志就要爆炸了。
Yeah, well cut out the formality. This magazine's about to blow.

1021
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,248
救援马上就到。
Help is on the way.

1022
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:58,239
-什么叫帮忙?-威尔玛要来接我们了
- What do you mean help? - Wilma is coming in to get us.

1023
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:00,845
什么?她不能降落在这里。她会被杀死。
What? She can't land here. She'll be killed.

1024
01:22:16,234 --> 01:22:18,241
<我>紧急!紧急! < / i >
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

1025
01:22:18,263 --> 01:22:21,921
-该走了。-这边走，巴克。通过吸烟。
- It's time to go. - This way, Buck. Through the smoke.

1026
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:36,576
出租车!出租车!
Taxi cab! Taxi!

1027
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,835
让我们离开这里。那本杂志就要炸了。
Let's get out of here. That magazine's about to blow.

1028
01:22:43,857 --> 01:22:45,803
我和你一起。进入!
I'm with you. Get in!

1029
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:13,439
很好。
Very nice.

1030
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:16,681
谢谢你！但我们还不清楚。
Thank you. But we're not in the clear yet.

1031
01:23:34,269 --> 01:23:36,453
我们将成为地球的统治者…
We would be rulers of Earth now...

1032
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:38,898
如果你没有让巴克·罗杰斯上船!
if you hadn't let Buck Rogers on board!

1033
01:23:40,177 --> 01:23:43,131
如果你更像个男人，他就没必要了。
He wouldn't have been necessary if you were more of a man.

1034
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:50,720
我们欠你的远不止道歉，巴克。特别是我。
We owe you a great deal more than apology, Buck. Especially me.

1035
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,444
我承认，我以为公主把你骗了。
I confess, I thought the princess had you beguiled.

1036
01:23:54,884 --> 01:23:58,666
好吧，我会说她有最好的一套…角在球。
Well, I will say she had the nicest set of... horns at the ball.

1037
01:23:58,862 --> 01:24:00,991
是的，那是一顶漂亮的帽子。
Yes, it was an attractive hat.

1038
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,086
你永远也成不了巴克·罗杰斯。
You'll never be the man Buck Rogers is.

1039
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,205
等我们再见到罗杰斯先生时再说吧。
We'll see when we meet Mr. Rogers again.

1040
01:24:09,632 --> 01:24:10,694
我们将。
And we will.

1041
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:12,908
我希望如此。
I hope so.

1042
01:24:17,806 --> 01:24:18,887
巴克……
Buck...

1043
01:24:20,262 --> 01:24:23,911
我知道我对你一直很冷淡……冷。
I know I've been aloof towards you... cold.

1044
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:26,902
我很害怕，不敢参与其中。
I was frightened, afraid to get involved.

1045
01:24:29,012 --> 01:24:30,908
我们之间的情况将会有所不同。
Things are going to be different now between us.

1046
01:24:32,237 --> 01:24:33,898
我不擅长做生意。
I'm not all business.

1047
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:36,638
我还是那个公主。
I am every bit the woman that the princess was.

1048
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:39,151
这很好。
That's nice.

1049
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:42,742
从现在开始，我要证明给你们看。
And, from this moment on, I'm going to prove it to you.

1050
01:24:44,057 --> 01:24:44,807
什么?
What?

1051
01:24:45,475 --> 01:24:47,976
好吧，我想这是我们最后一次见到凯恩…
Well, I guess that's the last we'll see of Kane...

1052
01:24:48,592 --> 01:24:49,818
和公主。
and the princess.

1053
01:24:51,101 --> 01:24:52,054
醒来吧!
Wakey!

1054
01:24:57,784 --> 01:24:59,198
眼睛向前。
Eyes forward.

1055
01:24:59,888 --> 01:25:00,958
我们会晕船的。
We'll get star sick.

1056
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:04,436
巴克!你是我喜欢的那种人。
Buck! You're my kind of guy.
