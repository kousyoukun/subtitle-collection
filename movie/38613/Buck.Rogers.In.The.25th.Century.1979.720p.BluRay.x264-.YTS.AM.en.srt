1
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,845
About 25 seconds.
Authorization for the launch.

2
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,407
- All ready. Twenty.
- Ten, nine, eight...

3
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,840
- seven, six, five...
- Internal management.

4
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:44,532
Four, three, two, one, zero.

5
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,656
In 1987, at the John F.
Kennedy Space Center...

6
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,914
NASA launched the latest US
interplanetary space probe.

7
00:00:57,044 --> 00:01:00,346
In the payload of the warhead
of the huge rocket...

8
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:05,039
I was going a man's exploration ship.
The Ranger 3.

9
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:08,427
On board the compact
interstellar ship...

10
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,643
Captain William "Buck" Rogers...

11
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,031
He experienced cosmic forces
that were incomprehensible.

12
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,333
He saw death closely.

13
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:22,634
In the blink of an eye,
unimaginable temperatures froze...

14
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,328
Your life maintenance team.

15
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:28,412
Ranger 3 went out of its way...

16
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:32,322
and it entered into a thousand
times more extensive orbit...

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,711
same that returned the ship
to the starting point...

18
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,145
to Mother Earth...

19
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,707
not five months later,
but 500 years later.

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,572
For 500 years, Buck Rogers was
adrift in a world where...

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,916
reality and fantasy merged
into an eternal dream.

22
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,550
Alert!! Alert!
A hostile ship approaches.

23
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:17,722
Clear the platforms to attack.

24
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,141
Wait!

25
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:45,353
There's something weird about that ship.
I had never seen one like that.

26
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:48,568
Prepare to tow it.

27
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:51,827
Embrace the alien ship
in a force field...

28
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:55,129
and prepare her to get
on board the Draconia.

29
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:18,850
- Transport of neurosystems.
- In transport.

30
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,409
Begin heart-lung procedure.

31
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,407
- Dilute a minor pressure agent.
- Transmitting.

32
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,447
Increase diogen and
crystalline in proportion.

33
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:39,835
The heart-lung response increased
0.2 and continues to rise.

34
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,137
We begin to receive positive
neurological signals.

35
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:45,614
Its alive.

36
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:49,915
Ahead.

37
00:06:56,823 --> 00:07:00,342
What's so important about the
intruder that you could not wait?

38
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:03,652
The man is alive.
I'm not sure why.

39
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,336
Not sure why?
Do I have to decipher the riddle?

40
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,552
I must decipher it.

41
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,636
The ship is outdated like none
I've seen in the star system...

42
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:15,417
or outside the history books.

43
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:16,990
Kane, please.

44
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,935
They froze it with a
combination of gases.

45
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,715
Oxygen, cryogen, ozone, metal.

46
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,931
Balanced almost perfectly.

47
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,929
They are techniques used in the
galaxy for terminal diseases.

48
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,927
Yes, at present.

49
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:34,142
However, there is another issue.
The ship of man.

50
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,019
Kane, you have one more minute.

51
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,704
His instruments stopped...

52
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:42,223
frozen in the year 1987.

53
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:46,438
- Are you telling me...
- The man could be 500 years old.

54
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,435
- Are you serious.
- Yes.

55
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,823
Frozen by elements so
instantaneously and perfectly...

56
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:58,125
which is totally preserved and alive.

57
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,556
It is a fascinating idea.

58
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:10,855
- Preserved young or old?
- Very young.

59
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,329
Are you flawed by the hard experience?

60
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,631
Fortunately for him, we are
very advanced in cryogenics.

61
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:28,928
I have not met a man of 500 years.
Prepare it for a hearing.

62
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:32,143
I think it's possible
that he is not coherent.

63
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,054
I will be lenient.

64
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,048
- Where I am?
- We ask the questions.

65
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,925
Who are you?

66
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:49,652
Captain Buck Rogers, Air
Force of the United States.

67
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,436
- Who are you?
- What did he say?

68
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,343
Something about a united states.

69
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:58,211
Captain, where are you going?

70
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,339
- What's going on?
- My head.

71
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:06,336
- Does anyone have an aspirin?
- What does that mean?

72
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,333
It must be some kind of
drug to remove the pain.

73
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,201
Give him something for his annoyance.

74
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:21,150
What place is this?

75
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,540
Where I am?

76
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:27,719
Who are you?

77
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,709
It's in the Draconia,
the king's flagship...

78
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,055
under the command of the
royal princess Ardala.

79
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,926
- Who?
- Where are you from.?

80
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:45,915
Wait, wait, wait. Slower.

81
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,914
What did he say about a ship?

82
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:51,910
It is a fortress of the king on the
way to Earth on a mission of peace.

83
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,214
On the way to Earth?

84
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:59,644
Do you mean to say that you are not...
of the...

85
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,121
Do you mean we're not...

86
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:05,335
Are not we on Earth?

87
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,420
I will definitely need the aspirin.

88
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,940
- Give it to her.
- Just a moment.

89
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,416
Captain.

90
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,335
Keep in mind that he is a prisoner...

91
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,541
of a dynasty that conquered
75% of the universe.

92
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:24,843
He will respond with care
if he values his life.

93
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,533
You. Is she a princess of real life?

94
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,701
I think we gave our captain
too much medicine.

95
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,351
No, no, I feel great.

96
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,734
The United States of America...

97
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,426
It was an empire of the planet
Earth a few centuries ago.

98
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:02,128
You took juice from those royal tutors.

99
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:05,030
You are from Earth, Kane.
You should know more than me.

100
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:08,333
The United States perished
almost 500 years ago.

101
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,122
That would explain his ship,
his clothes, the instruments.

102
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,197
I have a better explanation.
I think he's an infiltrator...

103
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:17,413
of the Federal Terrestrial Council.

104
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,237
- An infiltrator?
- Yes.

105
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:22,626
An Army spy put in our way.

106
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:26,536
They would not dare. I am a real
sent from my father's kingdom.

107
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,143
I am aware of his
father's purpose.

108
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,141
Guarantee trade between the
Earth and the draconians.

109
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:35,356
What reason would they have
to put a spy on board?

110
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:37,354
Check our ship.

111
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:40,622
- See if we are armed.
- I see.

112
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:44,923
- We could not allow that, could we?
- Do not.

113
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:49,911
Then, I suppose I can dispose
of Captain Rogers as he wishes.

114
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,559
How you take care of security
is your prerogative.

115
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,341
Follow me, Tiger Man.

116
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,063
Go design Heavens!

117
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,930
- How is he this morning?
- Fabulous.

118
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,364
What a coincidence.
I have a ship like this.

119
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:25,850
Disconnect the medication.

120
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:29,708
Oh, do not do that.
I really love it. But...

121
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:32,227
- Very soon he will leave.
- Great. Where we go?

122
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:34,356
- He'll go home.
- Great. Where is that?

123
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,833
- On earth.
- Oh, sure.

124
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,221
We repair and reprogram
your ship to take it home.

125
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:42,351
- Sure, he's anxious.
- Oh, yes.

126
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:45,130
It seems I've been absent for weeks.

127
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:49,736
Oh. Oh.

128
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,037
I should have had a lot of fun with you.

129
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,861
You know? I will miss you.
I have a great idea.

130
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:02,726
- How about we all go down together?
- Come on. We will reach it.

131
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,116
Not if I wake up.

132
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,937
Goodbye. Oh, what an incredible dream.

133
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,538
In Houston you will be surprised
when you return with this story.

134
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,145
Battery.

135
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,701
Prepare to launch
the alien ship.

136
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,697
Five seconds for the launch.
Four...

137
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,913
three two...

138
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:46,564
one. Launching.

139
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:56,209
It gave us the opportunity to test
the protective shield of the Earth.

140
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,728
How to prove it?
We know that anyone who enters...

141
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:03,203
without authorization they
incinerate it immediately.

142
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:06,940
But if our captain is a
spy, as I believe...

143
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,938
they will escort him through the shield...

144
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:11,719
along the channel that
only the military knows.

145
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:13,335
How can that help us?

146
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:17,237
I hid a microtransmitter
in Captain Rogers' ship...

147
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,626
who will send us a guided map.

148
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,060
When we give the signal...

149
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:25,231
your father's attack
forces will use the map...

150
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,229
to pierce his protective shield.

151
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,619
What if Captain Rogers is not a spy?

152
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,922
Then, it will burn.

153
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,354
I see.

154
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,293
It does not seem very pleased.

155
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,352
Of course I'm pleased.

156
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:45,433
But I have a strange feeling that
I will see Captain Rogers again.

157
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,032
Air control 1 to ship Able, Baker 4.

158
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,943
- Here location control.
- Approaching.

159
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,941
- What is your position and fuel?
- Confirmed.

160
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,155
Here Tartalia to air control Long.
We are approximately...

161
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:18,061
Houston control, here the 711 flight.
Answer, control of Houston.

162
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:21,624
Leave the cards and the backgammon.
Buck the lucky one came back.

163
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,231
Mr. Supervisor?

164
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,923
Supervisor ready. What position is it?

165
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:31,356
Delta sector, sir.
They do not know about me very often.

166
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,842
Yes, delta sector?

167
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,917
My scanners monitor the low
frequency direct band.

168
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:38,916
I'm getting some voices or something.

169
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:43,347
Sure you get pirate conversations.
There is no need to be alarmed.

170
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:46,736
Perhaps they are echoes of last
night's attack on the freighters.

171
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,908
Those signals will bounce all week.

172
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:52,210
Yes sir. I mean, no sir.
This is not an echo, sir.

173
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,034
It is a voice. It is a strong voice.
Is singing.

174
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,206
- Singing?
- Yes.

175
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:02,637
- Delta sector, did you say "singing"?
- Yes.

176
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:08,328
Operational control, I'm supervisor
14, give me the delta sector audio.

177
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,753
Answer, control of Houston.
Answer

178
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:31,572
Houston control, here the 711 flight.

179
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,439
Answer Do you receive me? Give me
instructions. I'm going to re-enter.

180
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,131
Answer, control of Houston.
Houston control, do you receive me?

181
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:45,563
Anden, papanatas, stop
slacking and give me "info".

182
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,909
It is practically a foreign language.

183
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,124
Is it a joke?

184
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:04,331
Goes directly to the protective shield.
Communicate me with interception.

185
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:17,235
With the interception squadron.

186
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:20,927
I'm Colonel Deering.
What are the coordinates?

187
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:28,444
Right. Back the shield 160 km.
Until checking the ship.

188
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:35,352
Alert, interceptors.
Alien ship position.

189
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,824
- Thats weird.
- What's weird?

190
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:49,211
The target moves very slowly
and irregularly to be a ship.

191
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:09,240
I have the target in sight.

192
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:12,629
What is it?

193
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:19,928
Hey, good.
I'm glad to see you...

194
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,448
boys.

195
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,274
Who are they?

196
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,702
What are they?

197
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:33,014
Attention, alien ship.
Do you listen me?

198
00:18:33,222 --> 00:18:36,220
I am "alien"?
You are not familiar.

199
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,697
Who are they?

200
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:41,043
Limit your answers to "yes" and \ x22.
It is in serious danger.

201
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:42,649
Whose? Of you?

202
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,430
It crosses a narrow corridor
that leads to the inner cities.

203
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,654
Cities what? Look, miss...

204
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:52,860
Colonel Deering. Now, keep silent.
If you leave the indicated route...

205
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:55,206
It will become steam, do you understand?

206
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:59,942
In steam? Yes Yes, I understand.
What should I do?

207
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,635
- Can you handle the ship manually?
- Clear.

208
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:04,937
Then, follow me very closely.

209
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:07,632
I'm after you.

210
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:24,618
This time they won us.
It must be the Russians.

211
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,136
He's doing fine.

212
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,925
- How do you say?
- I'm just trying to be friendly.

213
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:37,826
Violating our airspace is an
act of war, not friendship.

214
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,124
Wait until the Cape
guys find out.

215
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:50,209
Buck Rogers will land in
the center of Red Square.

216
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,624
Air control 1 access.

217
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:21,446
Cleared in the 1-0 corridor
Able for the approaching ship.

218
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:24,357
Confirmed. Open exterior
barriers for approach...

219
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:28,354
in the 1-0 corridor Able
for the approaching ship.

220
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,641
Hey, baby, what a great deal.

221
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,204
I'm Colonel Deering, commander
of Terrestrial Defense.

222
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,854
- You. Are you in charge of all this?
- Right.

223
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,939
- If there are no more questions...
- Hey, Colonel, quiet.

224
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,198
I would fly with you whenever you want.

225
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:08,065
- Interrogate this barbarian.
- What?

226
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,628
Listen. Hey, wait a moment!

227
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,148
I waited!

228
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,927
What... What do they do?
Hey, wait a minute!

229
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:29,918
How are you, Captain Rogers?

230
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,130
I am Dr. Huer.
I am very happy to meet you.

231
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:39,216
What is happening?
Where am I and what do they do to me?

232
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:43,347
We are studying it.
Everything is electronic and painless.

233
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:47,557
But we are as astonished as you.
For what happened.

234
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,425
But his tests give
us phenomenal data.

235
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,205
Fabulous. What is happening?

236
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:57,072
If I'm dead, I did not go to heaven.
What planet is this?

237
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,378
What planet?
Oh, it's Earth, of course.

238
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:01,851
He returned as his mission demanded...

239
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:07,716
to almost the precise area of
scheduled landing on your ship.

240
00:22:10,714 --> 00:22:12,843
Look, doctor.

241
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:16,058
I've been through a lot...

242
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,360
but in no way will you tell me...

243
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:21,054
that that city is Chicago.

244
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:24,921
No, it is not. There is nothing
left on Earth like Chicago.

245
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:30,656
Allow me to bring my administrator, Dr.
Theopolis.

246
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:32,489
Look, doctor...

247
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:36,130
Twiki, could you bring Dr.
Theopolis, please?

248
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:47,668
- What is that?
- He is Twiki.

249
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:51,336
- It's your robot.
- My what?

250
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:54,724
During your report and determination...

251
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:56,854
Twiki will be your assistant.

252
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,946
And this...
This is Dr. Theopolis.

253
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:03,631
Good morning, Dr. Theopolis.
It is a beautiful day.

254
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,847
Thank you. I did my best.

255
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:08,714
Dr. Theopolis is a member
of the Computer Council.

256
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,712
And in addition to other
things, he is responsible...

257
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,406
of the environmental controls
of the Internal City.

258
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:17,925
This afternoon I will introduce
a touch of mauve at sunset.

259
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:19,924
Not as deep as an amethyst...

260
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:22,704
but a more subtle
texture like cinnamon.

261
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:24,233
That's good.

262
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:28,439
I hope the captain sees it with us.
It really will be lovely.

263
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:33,739
If it were you, I would talk to
the programmer about that thing.

264
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:36,651
Captain Rogers, it's
us, the Council...

265
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,736
those who do all the programming.

266
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:43,210
Please reserve your opinion.
Let's go to work.

267
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:48,859
Captain Rogers, I'll leave
you with some advice.

268
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:51,422
These androids were not
programmed by humans.

269
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,419
They have programmed each
other for generations.

270
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:57,513
You see, the mistakes we made...

271
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:00,180
in areas, then, as our environment...

272
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,753
they were totally in his hands.

273
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:05,117
And they saved the Earth
from a secure end.

274
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:08,714
Little by little we have recovered
to not depend totally...

275
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,930
from other planets in
terms of water and food.

276
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:13,840
Androids are not human, but...

277
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:16,056
You can hurt your feelings.

278
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:20,053
It is this sensitivity that
separates them from the machines.

279
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:25,614
I will see it again
in about 16 hours.

280
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,917
16 hours? Wait a moment!

281
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:31,566
Do you think I'll stay here and
talk with a box for 16 hours?

282
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:36,910
Sit down, captain. Let's try
to be as pleasant as possible.

283
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:42,558
That's. Be a good robot, Twiki,
and put me on the table...

284
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:47,034
where I can see the captain well while
you bring him something to drink.

285
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,638
- I do not need anything to drink.
- Of course.

286
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:54,724
You're dehydrated from your
terrible experience, Buck.

287
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:56,548
If you allow me to call you Buck.

288
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:01,153
Now bring your drink to
Captain Rogers, Twiki.

289
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:12,841
Wow, you're a very attractive
man, Captain Buck Rogers.

290
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:16,151
Look, I've been waiting 24 hours...

291
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,922
to find out where I am,
who I am, who you are.

292
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,921
Could you give me some answers?

293
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:26,135
Of course, Buck. That's why I'm
here, to answer your questions.

294
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:27,830
Great. Begins.

295
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:31,131
You are Captain Buck Rogers, and
according to your ship's diary...

296
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:33,130
You left Earth in 1987.

297
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:35,911
I already know that. Tell
me what I do not know.

298
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:40,124
If the preliminary data is valid,
it seems that you came back...

299
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:42,340
to Earth 504 years later.

300
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:48,423
Now you are in the XXV century.

301
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:52,550
Buck? Are you okay, Buck?

302
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:54,549
You heard me?

303
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,719
I think I'm going to drink now.

304
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:08,060
I assure.
He is a wonderful man. Trust me.

305
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:10,711
I think you think he's
a wonderful man...

306
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,709
but you do not risk lives...

307
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,925
of our surviving warriors
for their subterfuge.

308
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:19,530
He is only a man. How could
it endanger our people?

309
00:26:19,617 --> 00:26:22,224
I could discredit the
treaty with Draconia.

310
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:26,246
He has not tried to do that.
He came to us bewildered.

311
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:30,348
I want the opportunity to
spend time with our captain.

312
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:33,563
If you look for a defect in
your testimony, you lose time.

313
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:36,039
Saving Earth is not
a waste of time...

314
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,564
despite supporting the
company of the captain.

315
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:41,210
Well, if Dr. Theopolis
has no objection...

316
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:43,122
I don't have any.

317
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,433
I have no objection.

318
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:48,856
The captain belongs to
me until I unmask him.

319
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:55,464
I had never seen
Colonel Deering...

320
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:59,197
so unusually emotional about something.

321
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,239
Nor about someone.

322
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:06,408
This part seems more a
dream than a nightmare.

323
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:15,229
Look, my behavior yesterday was
inappropriate. I want to apologize.

324
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,531
I accept your apology, captain.

325
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:23,222
Tell me about the holocaust.

326
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:25,351
I can not.

327
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:28,914
Well, it's not real until
you hear it and feel it.

328
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:32,616
I lost everything that
was important to me.

329
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:36,430
Mother, father, brothers,
sisters, a woman he loved.

330
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,428
If I do not hear something
that convinces me...

331
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,338
They will be waiting for me
somewhere in time and space.

332
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:49,420
- How is the exterior?
- From the city? I would not like it.

333
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,723
- Radiation?
- In some places.

334
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,939
The rest are ruins and scorched earth.

335
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,849
We depend on trade
with other planets.

336
00:27:56,937 --> 00:28:00,938
Tell me about the trade agreement with
the draconians and with the princess.

337
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,148
The pirates who cut our transport
routes kill us with hunger.

338
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:07,928
The draconians promised
to keep them open...

339
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,230
in exchange for giving them
landing privileges on Earth.

340
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:13,446
I would like to see my ship.
It's possible?

341
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:17,052
Anything is possible, captain.

342
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:22,049
Those guards thought it was
crazy to come at this time.

343
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:24,655
I already slept an eternity.

344
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,435
Do you recognize those brands?

345
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:32,432
They are common in ships
that were in combat.

346
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:35,213
Well, I was not in combat.
You. They shot me?

347
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:37,342
- Of course not.
- Then who?

348
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:40,426
Maybe the pirates who attacked us.

349
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:43,120
And why am I still here?
Why did not they kill me?

350
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,640
Why did not they strip
her or open her?

351
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:49,072
The pirates are meticulous, they
would check an unarmed ship...

352
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:51,201
especially one that was shot.

353
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,849
He was in flight a long time.
Anything could happen.

354
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,933
Those brands are new.
Cordite has not oxidized.

355
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:03,844
I think Princess Ardala's
ships shot me...

356
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:05,634
before towing me inside his ship.

357
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:10,230
- Your ship is unarmed. Is the law.
- Well, it seems he's raping her.

358
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,934
What do you suggest, Captain?

359
00:29:12,142 --> 00:29:16,226
Have them check their ship before letting
it go through its protective shield.

360
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,701
It would be an insult.
The alliance is based on good faith.

361
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:25,133
Good faith is for bureaucrats and
what gives them a protected city.

362
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:28,226
I would go armed to the teeth
or they will be easy prey.

363
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:32,431
For someone whose expertise
is five centuries old...

364
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,561
You seem to be very inflexible.

365
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,558
Is right.

366
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,208
It's not my business how
they ruin your world.

367
00:29:40,338 --> 00:29:42,095
My generation did not know
what I was doing either.

368
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,398
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Where are you going, Captain?

369
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:47,420
- I'll go around the city.
- He's under suspicion. Can not.

370
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,636
I have to find out what
changed in 500 years.

371
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:53,720
- That is forbidden.
- Is a free country. At least, it was.

372
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:57,717
He is arrested and is my prisoner.
I can not let him go.

373
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:59,628
He will have to shoot me to stop me.

374
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,149
It does not leave me an alternative.

375
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,236
You did not have to come with me.

376
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:18,050
I wanted to be with you.
I wish you listened to reasons.

377
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,656
This is nothing compared
to what awaits us.

378
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:27,043
- Why do not we spend the night here?
- Oh, we would die frozen.

379
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:29,616
The heat that you feel is
emanated by the Inner City.

380
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:33,213
Within a few hours, the energy
will be reduced by two thirds...

381
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:35,932
and the temperature here
will be below zero.

382
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:38,730
So, I guess we have to continue.

383
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,651
I'm sorry I brought them.

384
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:43,553
They assigned me to be with you.

385
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,114
No one forced me to be on your side.
I believed in you and I still do it.

386
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:49,245
What did he say?

387
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,416
- You do not want to know.
- Oh.

388
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:03,383
- What did he say now?
- You do not want to know.

389
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:06,058
Come back I can face
whatever is there...

390
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:08,447
if it helps me discover
what happened to my people.

391
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,229
I'll stay with you, Buck.

392
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,861
- What did he say?
- You do not want to know.

393
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:54,631
- Stop saying that! I want to know.
- He thinks they're watching us.

394
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:57,933
It's just your imagination. Walking.

395
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:05,710
- It is impossible. Totally impossible.
- We'll be fine.

396
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,442
- It's not you they want.
- What?

397
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,137
Do not be offended,
but they want us.

398
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:19,352
My gold circuits are worth
a lot in the black market.

399
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:24,565
And as for Twiki, well, I'd hate
to tell you how they'll use it.

400
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,650
Buck, where are you going?

401
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:29,909
STATE STREET

402
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,864
It's here.

403
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,336
I do not want to question
your strategy, Buck...

404
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:43,117
but to stop in the middle
of the street is stupid...

405
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:46,201
Given the circumstances.

406
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,154
Come!

407
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:54,152
I do not know where he is going.
Just follow him.

408
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:28,431
I do not know what he does.
Just follow him, Twiki.

409
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,336
- Holy...
- I know, Twiki.

410
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:43,203
I see them. Just keep going.

411
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:50,155
Do not think about that.
Your batteries will be exhausted.

412
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:05,230
Here my parents are buried.

413
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:07,360
At least I already know a part.

414
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,139
We can not stay long, Buck.
They are following us.

415
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:16,830
What happened? There is only one
gravestone, it has no date.

416
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,568
They only buried some lucky ones.

417
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:23,131
It happened so fast that they
buried the families together.

418
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:26,650
The systems fell and the dates
stopped being important.

419
00:34:26,736 --> 00:34:29,126
In the end, there were
no armies or fighting.

420
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:33,340
Only hunger, pollution
and prolonged death.

421
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:38,944
- I wish I had been with them.
- You can not go back, Buck.

422
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:43,072
The past is gone. But you can
help us with our future.

423
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:48,416
If there is a future.
I think it's too late.

424
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:50,632
Run, Twiki.

425
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,221
Watch out!

426
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:39,118
Damned...

427
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:19,132
They are too many, Buck, it has no case.

428
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:27,125
If someone has some final words,
now it's time to say them.

429
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:38,204
Let's get out of here.

430
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:27,038
Go, Colonel. What brings you
here on a night like this?

431
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,862
Captain, I came to look for
you with great danger for me.

432
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,999
- Very courageous.
- Very what?

433
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:37,552
Forget it.
Well, do not expect a fanfare.

434
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,203
We were fine until you arrived.
Right, Theo?

435
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,200
- Well...
- Forget it, Theo.

436
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,990
Well, at least Twiki is on my side.

437
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:49,543
I like it here. It's a bit primitive,
but it's the south side of Chicago.

438
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,629
Captain, we waste our time. Let's move on.

439
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:55,322
I still do not finish.
So unless I'm going to shoot myself...

440
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:58,928
Captain, he escaped once, but not now.
Lieutenant.

441
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,836
What is the problem?

442
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,136
So, it does work for pirates.

443
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:16,437
- I still can not believe it.
- Well, you're the only one, Theo.

444
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:19,651
This microtransmitter was
on your navigation device.

445
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,345
Revealed our secret
access corridors.

446
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,821
This is not how an innocent man behaves.

447
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:27,863
At first I thought I was guilty.
And later...

448
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:31,338
They are subjective in their
evaluation of Buck Rogers.

449
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:34,727
I, on the other hand, support
it for practical reasons.

450
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:38,073
- And which are they?
- I'm convinced of something.

451
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,635
Our friend, Captain Rogers,
met Princess Ardala...

452
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:43,720
and was aboard the draconian ship.

453
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:46,327
Your descriptions
are too precise...

454
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:48,117
to be the conjectures of a pirate.

455
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,845
Maybe the pirates boarded that
ship and gave him the information.

456
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:54,235
Precious, they are the
deadliest enemies.

457
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:58,232
It is unlikely that a pirate
survived such a visit...

458
00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:59,926
to tell it.

459
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,041
There's news from Captain Rogers.

460
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,734
They intercepted her
ship and escorted her...

461
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,559
as I expected.

462
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,033
The transmitter that we installed in your
ship gave us the necessary information...

463
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:33,879
so that my father crosses the shield?

464
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,725
Yes, but they discovered the transmitter.

465
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:38,733
- That bad.
- That does not change things.

466
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:42,547
When we enter, we will destroy
the shield from within.

467
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:45,936
The earthlings will not suspect...

468
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:48,326
when he tells you he was here?

469
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:52,062
They will not believe you. We can
give Captain Rogers for dead.

470
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:56,501
Stop worrying about the trial.

471
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,532
I am a member of the Council and
I will personally defend you.

472
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,052
Thanks, Theo.
It is good to have at least one friend.

473
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,571
Forgive me, Twiki. Two friends.

474
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:13,133
The Council is ready to
hear the final arguments...

475
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,566
in the case against
Captain Buck Rogers...

476
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:18,833
on charges of espionage and treason.

477
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,647
- Lawyer Apol.
- The case of the State is elementary.

478
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:26,210
The captain flew through
our defense network...

479
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,729
with a microtransmitter, revealing
the accesses of the shield.

480
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:33,735
What reward would you consider fair...

481
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:37,550
Captain Rogers for selling
to the human race?

482
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,852
Only your pirate
friends can respond.

483
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,328
But I maintain that in my opinion...

484
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:46,413
what they seek at all costs is the
destruction of the treaty with Draconia.

485
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:49,715
Since its promulgation
means its downfall.

486
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:52,148
The State finished presenting its case.

487
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:55,145
Now we will hear the defense.
Dr. Theopolis.

488
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,228
Distinguished colleagues,
you heard the evidence...

489
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:05,356
and I challenge you to
find this man guilty.

490
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:09,830
There is no evidence to indicate
that he was born on this planet...

491
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,133
because we all know very well...

492
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,043
that there are no records
prior to the great holocaust.

493
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,214
He can not explain how the
transmitter came to his ship...

494
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:21,430
because it is not his work.

495
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,123
He is an innocent pawn in a great war.

496
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,947
I tell you, colleagues, if
you find this man guilty...

497
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:31,205
You must find me guilty.

498
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:35,550
My sensors tell me
that this man is good.

499
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:38,853
The defense finished presenting its case.
Thank you.

500
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:43,415
Captain Rogers, do you have any last
words before we give the ruling?

501
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:53,233
I'm just an innocent pawn, a
puppet, whatever they call me.

502
00:41:53,363 --> 00:41:55,145
It was another who manipulated me.

503
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:59,228
They should worry less about
me and more about them.

504
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:03,920
Because I can not harm them anymore
no matter what the result is today.

505
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,831
But he or she...

506
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:10,046
I could destroy them.

507
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:20,343
Very good, Buck.
We do not have to worry.

508
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:24,905
Unanimously, the Council
rules in favor of the State.

509
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:29,641
Captain Rogers, the
Council finds you guilty.

510
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:32,639
Your life will end.

511
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:36,853
The execution will be
carried out immediately.

512
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,851
The session is over.

513
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:42,067
I can not believe it.

514
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:56,926
Will not say anything?

515
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:59,992
- Do not.
- That's ridiculous.

516
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:03,138
He was sentenced to death.

517
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:07,222
At the very least, he would think that
a man of his type would be furious...

518
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:10,046
that would attack me verbally,
that I would say something.

519
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:11,654
Goodbye?

520
00:43:11,697 --> 00:43:13,912
Buck, enough.
It is being unreasonable.

521
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,649
Am I being unreasonable?

522
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:23,128
It is almost as if he believed that
the sentence will not be carried out.

523
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:27,642
I do not think there is anyone
here who carries out the sentence.

524
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,519
I know that you will not be in charge.

525
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:34,115
He still clings to his story
that the Draconia is armed.

526
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,114
I can prove it.

527
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,719
What would you say if I said...

528
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,240
I came to give you that opportunity?

529
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:44,933
How?

530
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:50,364
We will go to the Draconia
flagship to verify its history...

531
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:52,536
that they found it.

532
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:55,925
And will they investigate
while they are there?

533
00:43:56,056 --> 00:43:57,620
Exact.

534
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:02,616
No no. I...
I do not like that plan.

535
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:08,438
- It worries me.
- Why?

536
00:44:08,568 --> 00:44:11,219
Well, you see, my
execution is scheduled.

537
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,356
If I do not show up,
I'll get in trouble.

538
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:17,431
You are impossible. Do I offer his
life and he answers me with jokes?

539
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,430
That's what it means.

540
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,556
Does it offer to end my
execution or just postpone it?

541
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,857
If he shows that his story is real...

542
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,331
Walking.

543
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,625
Stay close to my ship.
The maneuvers will be simple.

544
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:52,927
Stay on automatic pilot.
It will only control the acceleration.

545
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,143
Thanks, colonel.

546
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:57,619
Can I look out the window?

547
00:44:57,706 --> 00:44:59,496
This is no time for
frivolities, Captain.

548
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:02,833
The pirates destroyed a
third of our ships here.

549
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,918
When they attack, they attack fast.

550
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:06,829
It can not beat the computer.

551
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,723
It will take evasive measures
to evade its missiles.

552
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,738
If you try to fly, it
will only cost one ship.

553
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,824
I appreciate your concern.

554
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,126
I wish I had brought a book.

555
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:20,523
I have a goal in vector 401.

556
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:23,426
Aware, Colonel.
I see the target to port.

557
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:25,554
If you see it at this distance...

558
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,858
It must be giant.

559
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:41,239
Permit to board? Why?

560
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,632
He is a special envoy.

561
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,939
That's all I know.

562
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:48,407
This does not conform to the protocol.

563
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:52,143
- What do you think they're up to?
- I don't know.

564
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:54,359
But they warned us in advance.

565
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,532
And there will be nothing that betrays us.

566
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,833
I would like to know what they are up to.

567
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:02,440
Let's prepare them a
very special welcome.

568
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,132
Send our pirate ships.

569
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,653
And prepare a surprise for them.

570
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:24,425
Welcome aboard the
Draconia flagship...

571
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:27,517
sent from Draco,
conqueror of space...

572
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:31,941
leader of Astrium, ruler
of the draconian kingdom.

573
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:35,199
I present your daughter,
Princess Ardala.

574
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:38,718
Haunted.
This is an unexpected pleasure.

575
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,151
We can hardly receive
them properly.

576
00:46:41,238 --> 00:46:43,115
Your time is an adequate reception.

577
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:47,234
I am Col. Deering, commander of the
3rd Terrestrial Council Force.

578
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:50,623
And I think you already
know Captain Rogers.

579
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:54,228
No. If I had met a young
and dashing captain...

580
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,444
I would surely remember it vividly.

581
00:46:57,357 --> 00:47:00,354
I do not think we had the pleasure.

582
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:02,440
I think he's wrong, princess.

583
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,221
I never forget a knuckle.

584
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:09,739
- Captain.
- We want to get to the bottom of the matter.

585
00:47:11,347 --> 00:47:13,823
Do I describe some of
the interior cameras?

586
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:17,828
What interior cameras are you referring to?

587
00:47:18,037 --> 00:47:21,122
I do not find it memorable,
but I will never forget it.

588
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,859
I especially liked the
high neck dress and...

589
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:28,421
Colonel Deering, what's wrong?
Why you came?

590
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:31,071
Pirates are in this sector.

591
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,330
We came to make sure
they arrived safely.

592
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:44,722
Alert! Alert! Alert!

593
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,233
Hostile ships attack the Draconia.

594
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,840
And Captain Rogers...

595
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:51,534
All staff to their
defense posts.

596
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:55,618
- Men, to your ships!
- Alert to all posts!

597
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,833
This is how they offer us protection.

598
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,830
Go escort.
At least we will die together.

599
00:48:09,651 --> 00:48:12,215
Clear launch channels to attack.

600
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:15,038
Alert!! Alert!

601
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,828
Care, greater. It is behind you.

602
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:08,043
Climb, I'll intercept it.

603
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,431
Not there! He goes to his sight!

604
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,861
Captain Rogers, I ordered
you not to interfere.

605
00:49:19,947 --> 00:49:22,728
Colonel, you need all
the help available.

606
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:29,071
- Bandit at 12.00, up.
- At 12.00 what?

607
00:49:30,852 --> 00:49:34,328
Lieutenant Wrather, ignore it.
Captain Rogers, shut up.

608
00:49:34,415 --> 00:49:36,414
Computers are superior to you.

609
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:39,628
If your computers do not
do something fast...

610
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,884
they're going to eliminate
their lieutenant Wrather.

611
00:49:46,406 --> 00:49:48,622
Be careful, Thornberry!

612
00:49:51,142 --> 00:49:53,140
Colonel, you must change to manual flight.

613
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,704
If it does not stop
distracting our pilots...

614
00:49:55,834 --> 00:49:59,049
Help the lieutenant.
There are a couple of pirates behind you.

615
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:02,698
I'll change to manual, Colonel.

616
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:06,217
Let's see if I can share
what we have been receiving.

617
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:08,433
Buck Rogers, I order
him to return to base.

618
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:16,340
Now let's see if they like to send
the defensive load to the old one.

619
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:39,323
I destroyed one. Six are missing.

620
00:50:45,363 --> 00:50:46,405
I gave you!

621
00:51:04,218 --> 00:51:07,138
- Lower and turn on the rear propellers!
- I can not!

622
00:51:07,346 --> 00:51:10,214
It goes against the principles
of modern air combat.

623
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,551
That is called sending the
load with the linebackers.

624
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:34,240
I do not know what happened
to the combat computers...

625
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:36,847
but thanks.

626
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:40,235
Now, captain, let's go home.

627
00:51:42,712 --> 00:51:44,714
- Mine or yours?
- What?

628
00:51:44,922 --> 00:51:46,925
- What did he say?
- Just kidding.

629
00:51:47,134 --> 00:51:49,229
Air control 1 access.

630
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,442
1-0 Runner Able cleared
for approaching ship.

631
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,351
Confirmed. Open exterior
barriers for approach...

632
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:03,348
in the 1-0 Able corridor
for the approaching ship.

633
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:12,732
Colonel Deering, have you
seen Captain Rogers?

634
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,340
Yes because?

635
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:17,859
The Council received a request
from Princess Ardala.

636
00:52:19,032 --> 00:52:20,944
What does that have to do with the captain?

637
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:22,995
She thinks that he only saved...

638
00:52:23,203 --> 00:52:25,549
to his unarmed ship of
the renegade pirates...

639
00:52:25,636 --> 00:52:27,548
and he wants to thank you personally.

640
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:29,329
He alone?

641
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,936
Apparently, they almost
destroy your ship too.

642
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,412
If it was not for Captain
Rogers' ability...

643
00:52:34,543 --> 00:52:36,420
and his quick reaction,
the princess thinks...

644
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:41,060
I do not care about the opinion of the
princess. I know what happened. I was there.

645
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:46,620
Tomorrow I will conquer Earth.

646
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:52,138
Tomorrow we will conquer
the Earth, your highness.

647
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:18,858
You look great, Buck.

648
00:53:20,335 --> 00:53:22,116
Something bothers you?

649
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:24,731
Why did you invite me to this?
Nobody believes me.

650
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,068
Princess Ardala wants to thank you for
protecting her ship from pirates.

651
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:33,542
I would also like to tell you something...
In private.

652
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,628
I'm sure they will not allow it.

653
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:37,931
After all, you're just a captain.

654
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:40,538
And you do not even have
an officer's degree.

655
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:44,926
- Do you have something for the headache?
- You feel bad?

656
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:47,707
I guess I'm not fully
recovered from my trip.

657
00:53:47,837 --> 00:53:51,573
Why did not you say something?
Twiki will bring you a relaxing one.

658
00:53:52,616 --> 00:53:54,571
Well, it's time to enter.

659
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:57,438
Let's not wait for the
trade delegation.

660
00:54:20,204 --> 00:54:22,854
Welcome.
The draconian trade delegation...

661
00:54:22,941 --> 00:54:24,940
under the leadership of
his royal highness...

662
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,633
the princess of the kingdom. Ardala.

663
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:34,150
I bring you greetings on
this historic occasion.

664
00:54:35,323 --> 00:54:37,235
My father, King Draco...

665
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:41,362
wants to give them their
flagship Draconia...

666
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:45,838
full of the latest technology.
It symbolizes a new glorious era...

667
00:54:45,924 --> 00:54:48,531
of commerce and peace.

668
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,440
Let the celebration begin.

669
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:12,860
We brought you some pills, Buck.

670
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:17,336
For your headache.
It is a very strong relaxant.

671
00:55:17,544 --> 00:55:19,856
Do not take more than one at a time.

672
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,723
Thanks guys.

673
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:26,068
I see that the dance has
advanced a lot in 500 years.

674
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:38,928
I will need something else. A rose.

675
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,057
- You said a rose?
- Yes, red.

676
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:45,706
- What do you need a rose for?
- Twiki, can you bring me a quick one?

677
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,349
Do you like our presentation,
Captain Rogers?

678
00:55:59,435 --> 00:56:00,913
Is awesome.

679
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:06,734
Did this folkloric dance
come from your dad's world?

680
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:10,436
Excuse me, but I did not
understand what he said.

681
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:14,641
And I suggest you use a more
respectful reference than "dad".

682
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,205
Maybe he's the greatest
leader we know.

683
00:56:17,335 --> 00:56:19,638
I'll give you a warning, Colonel.

684
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:24,851
- Beware of gifts from the Greeks.
- The Greeks?

685
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:28,935
That was before you were born.
A long time ago.

686
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:32,150
Tell me, do you know the
history of the Trojan horse?

687
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:34,931
Do not.

688
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:37,538
No, huh? Well, forget it.

689
00:56:37,624 --> 00:56:40,145
I guess I'm from a time
that was paranoid.

690
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,230
See you.

691
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:52,222
- Your rose, Buck.
- How cute. Thanks, Twiki.

692
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:55,350
Buck, nobody gave flowers
to the princess.

693
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:57,227
You will make everyone look ridiculous.

694
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:00,217
Do not separate, friends.
We follow.

695
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:11,434
Go, Captain Rogers.
Congratulations and thanks.

696
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:15,423
We are grateful to you for saving
us from those horrible corsairs.

697
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:22,070
Not so strong. Here they believe
that I am a corsair, thanks to you.

698
00:57:22,114 --> 00:57:25,936
To me? I wish I had not made
him go through much shame.

699
00:57:26,145 --> 00:57:27,849
- Are you angry?
- From...

700
00:57:27,935 --> 00:57:31,150
- The O!
- What a great body.

701
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:37,711
- From me to you.
- Who is your lovely little friend?

702
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:40,534
It's called Twiki.

703
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:43,229
Yes, and that thing hanging
from his neck is Theo...

704
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,148
Member of the Computer Council.

705
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:48,051
- Your Majesty.
- Do you want to dance with me?

706
00:57:48,138 --> 00:57:51,222
- The princess does not...
- It does not bother me to dance.

707
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:23,937
I'm not up to date with these steps.

708
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,327
If you have a preference...
It's my party.

709
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:28,934
Fantastic.
How about something old-fashioned?

710
00:58:29,064 --> 00:58:33,409
Sir, excuse me. Do you know rock?
You know...

711
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,624
Try it, try it Ande.

712
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:43,532
No, no, that's not it. Just let yourself go. Let
go. Let yourself be carried away by the music.

713
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:47,051
That's. Right. Yes. That's. Yes.

714
00:58:55,045 --> 00:58:56,618
That makes?

715
00:58:56,826 --> 00:59:00,128
It's called juerguear.
It's old. If you scare her...

716
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:03,917
Nothing scares me.

717
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,427
Very good. Come stomping.

718
00:59:31,843 --> 00:59:35,537
- It's expressive.
- It's nasty!

719
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:41,923
- What happens if we crash?
- Automatically we are husband and wife.

720
00:59:43,227 --> 00:59:45,138
Great. A juerguear.

721
00:59:46,572 --> 00:59:49,222
You are a special
man, Captain Rogers.

722
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:51,916
I think the earthlings
believed his story...

723
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,349
of having been frozen 500 years.

724
00:59:55,653 --> 00:59:58,650
- It is not like this. They think I'm a spy.
- My own?

725
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:03,086
- They are not sure.
- Do you want to join me?

726
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:06,557
- Who do I talk to negotiate with?
- With me.

727
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,554
Tell me, is that building still
the communications center?

728
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:14,421
It is secret information.

729
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:16,072
Of course.

730
01:00:18,332 --> 01:00:20,329
I will always be one of you, Dr. Huer.

731
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:24,066
Maybe I'll stay
here permanently.

732
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,631
We hope so.

733
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:46,918
Your Highness, some ministers
want to talk to you.

734
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:50,221
- Then, Kane.
- The affairs of the kingdom come first!

735
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:54,217
His father hopes that it serves
the interests of the kingdom.

736
01:00:54,348 --> 01:00:56,443
If you do not...

737
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:59,735
He has another 29 daughters who will!

738
01:01:07,642 --> 01:01:11,727
It was a pleasure, Captain
Rogers, but we must do our duty.

739
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:15,723
Later?

740
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:18,721
I'll leave on my private
ship at midnight.

741
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:21,937
I'll be there.

742
01:01:27,932 --> 01:01:30,626
Captain Rogers.

743
01:01:30,712 --> 01:01:33,710
I would like to know if it is
a good time to talk to you.

744
01:01:34,406 --> 01:01:36,144
The princess left suddenly...

745
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,924
and it seems that the party was over.

746
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:41,209
He has no plans, do he?

747
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:43,573
- Well...
- Very good.

748
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:47,031
- There's something I want to say.
- Well I...

749
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,654
I thought he was a
spy, Captain Rogers.

750
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,913
I was wrong.

751
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:19,850
Do you want to go somewhere else?

752
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:24,151
I'm not ready for that yet.

753
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,283
I have not done it for a long time.
500 years.

754
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:32,537
My reintegration should be calm.

755
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:53,912
Do not worry.

756
01:02:55,432 --> 01:02:57,648
Better listen to it, friend.
It is reasonable.

757
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,343
I asked Captain Rogers
to accompany us.

758
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:04,035
You're lucky not to fight with me.

759
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:17,547
We are almost there.

760
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:21,066
Where are you going?

761
01:03:21,153 --> 01:03:23,716
I know it's cold, but
we have no choice.

762
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:26,150
We have orders to
stay close to Buck.

763
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:29,147
And maybe he needs us, so he
goes back to the refrigerator.

764
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,926
Twiki, I'm talking to you.

765
01:03:34,925 --> 01:03:37,619
I freeze the ball bearings.

766
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:44,614
Captain Rogers does
not appear anywhere.

767
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,447
What did you expect from a primitive?

768
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:50,132
We will let you know if we
know anything about him.

769
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:55,041
You're a spy, Buck Rogers...

770
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,734
and I know exactly where you are.

771
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:11,073
Outside.

772
01:04:18,328 --> 01:04:20,544
They are better pets if you castrate them.

773
01:04:21,717 --> 01:04:24,323
Let's get comfortable.
Serve us something to drink.

774
01:04:34,056 --> 01:04:36,054
At last we are alone.

775
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:58,125
You will not say anything?

776
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:00,862
Until this moment I did not
know what I was missing.

777
01:05:00,906 --> 01:05:02,861
I also have to confess something.

778
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:05,207
Is there a man waiting for you at home?

779
01:05:06,423 --> 01:05:08,552
I had not realized
what I was missing.

780
01:05:09,855 --> 01:05:12,488
You are different. You are arrogant.

781
01:05:12,697 --> 01:05:15,330
You flagrantly ignore the orders.

782
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,414
And you're the kind of man who
could overthrow my father.

783
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:21,412
Overthrowing your father is
the last thing on my mind.

784
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:25,061
- I brought you here for a reason.
- I was counting on that.

785
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:27,712
I want you by my side.

786
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:31,057
That was not exactly
what I was thinking.

787
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:33,707
Consider it.

788
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:38,139
You have no idea what it is to be the
daughter of Draco the Conqueror.

789
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:40,702
29 sisters on your heels.

790
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:45,698
Cortesanos snitches like
Kane competing for power.

791
01:05:47,132 --> 01:05:50,738
But with a man...
a true man like you...

792
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:56,647
I could challenge my father,
I could live my own life.

793
01:05:56,733 --> 01:06:00,122
- Yes?
- A new magnificent dynasty.

794
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,643
Are not you getting ahead of the facts?

795
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:05,554
Now give me my drink.

796
01:06:19,152 --> 01:06:21,325
- We have to be very careful.
- Oh yeah?

797
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,939
The moment is not the right one.

798
01:06:26,147 --> 01:06:28,927
Things never change.
This has always been the case.

799
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:32,534
Why did not I meet you
before, Buck Rogers?

800
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,053
We have a lot of time, do not we?

801
01:06:43,439 --> 01:06:47,566
Weapons personnel show up on the
platform to load the weapons.

802
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:49,825
Look, they're sleeping down there.

803
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:53,127
The fools will never know what happened.

804
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,341
I am very relaxed.
Can you turn off the lights?

805
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:18,030
If you are a spy, I will have to kill you.

806
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,540
If those are the things you say
in bed, I found your problem.

807
01:07:39,137 --> 01:07:41,439
This is not good at all, Twiki.

808
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,047
There are soldiers everywhere...

809
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:46,653
and we do not even know where to
start looking for Captain Rogers.

810
01:08:23,408 --> 01:08:25,841
Caramba!

811
01:08:25,929 --> 01:08:28,708
Let's see if we can find your pajamas.

812
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:56,862
The pirate ships. This is how they could
attack us. It was his own people.

813
01:09:33,617 --> 01:09:36,051
- Where is the Tiger Man?
- I do not know, sir.

814
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:48,128
Go away!

815
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,736
Did you wake up, my love?

816
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:58,947
Did you wake up, baby?

817
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:02,205
Shoot him!

818
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:08,548
Outside! Take it out!
Take it out! Execute it!

819
01:10:08,635 --> 01:10:13,067
- No. Take him for questioning.
- Are you giving a counter order?

820
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:16,151
Under the circumstances, yes.

821
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:17,932
Obey me.

822
01:10:19,062 --> 01:10:20,627
Take it.

823
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:32,227
You will have to give me explanations.

824
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,355
Do I have to explain?

825
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:38,439
Well, it's not a Gucci,
but what does it matter?

826
01:10:47,128 --> 01:10:49,040
I do not want to be caught either.

827
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:52,560
But something is very wrong and
we must find out what it is.

828
01:10:53,733 --> 01:10:57,034
I hope you know that this
violates my guarantee.

829
01:10:57,121 --> 01:11:00,944
Obviously she has been... very worried.

830
01:11:01,032 --> 01:11:04,072
Then I'll take care of
you for your insolence.

831
01:11:04,116 --> 01:11:06,418
Give the order to attack now.

832
01:11:06,549 --> 01:11:09,720
We can not attack without the
support of his father's forces.

833
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:12,197
Kane, how weak you are!

834
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:16,324
We do not need my father.
We have the element of surprise.

835
01:11:16,412 --> 01:11:19,931
We will destroy the Inner City
and the protective shield.

836
01:11:20,061 --> 01:11:22,363
When my father's
forces arrive...

837
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:24,414
we will be sitting on the
throne of the Earth.

838
01:11:24,623 --> 01:11:27,621
At least I do, since obviously
you do not have the courage.

839
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,616
Very well, we will attack.

840
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,831
It's a wise decision, Kane.

841
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:41,046
Meanwhile, Captain Rogers
is loose on the ship.

842
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:43,043
Find them.

843
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:46,041
Alert!! Alert!

844
01:11:48,822 --> 01:11:51,212
Intruder aboard the ship.

845
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:55,035
Alert! Alert! Alert!

846
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:57,737
It's Buck.

847
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,639
I see.
Bring on the enemy's uniform.

848
01:12:06,548 --> 01:12:08,850
This will warm your tail.

849
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:17,627
They are warships.
It means that the treaty is a hoax.

850
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:21,407
But we can do a last
service to our country.

851
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,057
We can take care of Captain Rogers.

852
01:12:26,707 --> 01:12:29,705
Six minutes to attack and count.

853
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:47,431
Five minutes to attack and count.

854
01:12:47,561 --> 01:12:51,862
- Do not move, Captain Rogers.
- Theo, Twiki, what are you doing here?

855
01:12:51,906 --> 01:12:56,424
- This will not be pleasing to anyone.
- Can you go? I have work to do.

856
01:12:56,633 --> 01:13:00,117
- We realize, traitor.
- Do not you realize what's going on?

857
01:13:00,204 --> 01:13:04,332
- I'd say they're going to bomb the Earth.
- Do you recognize the ships?

858
01:13:04,418 --> 01:13:07,547
- No, but I do not see how...
- They are pirate ships.

859
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,543
Why would there be pirate ships
in the draconian flagship?

860
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:14,715
Forgives. You do not convince me.
Now join us.

861
01:13:14,846 --> 01:13:17,322
- 4 minutes to attack and counting.
- Do not.

862
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:21,146
Look, pile of electronic nonsense, I do
not expect you to know everything...

863
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:24,230
But did you hear that the
bombs were in the tubes?

864
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:28,227
Silence, Twiki.
I'm getting confused

865
01:13:28,357 --> 01:13:32,702
I'll help you clarify things. There are
no pirate ships, there never were.

866
01:13:32,911 --> 01:13:35,353
They are draconian bombers
disguised as looters.

867
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:38,828
They interrupted the routes to
force them to sign the treaty.

868
01:13:40,436 --> 01:13:42,912
Of course.
It's witty, if it's true.

869
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:44,737
Three minutes to attack and count.

870
01:13:44,823 --> 01:13:48,038
You have ten seconds to decide
if you believe me or Kane.

871
01:13:48,126 --> 01:13:51,340
- Go alternative.
- And you do you think?

872
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,522
- Can not you see I'm telling the truth?
- Yes.

873
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:57,553
If you do not want to become spare
parts, follow your instincts.

874
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,072
Well, but only if you help
us reach a communicator...

875
01:14:02,115 --> 01:14:04,114
to be able to warn
the Inner City.

876
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,546
They will have to do it alone.

877
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:09,632
I have to make sure these
ships do not take off.

878
01:14:09,718 --> 01:14:13,933
Commander Kane. There is an
unconscious guard on platform three.

879
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:17,234
- Two minutes to attack.
- Time is up, Theo.

880
01:14:17,443 --> 01:14:19,928
- They found the guard I knocked out.
- Very good.

881
01:14:20,059 --> 01:14:22,622
We will do our part.
Good luck, Buck.

882
01:14:39,913 --> 01:14:43,041
Come to the console, Twiki.

883
01:14:44,823 --> 01:14:47,134
Now, take the center panel.

884
01:14:47,342 --> 01:14:51,122
- Ninety seconds to attack.
- Let it go.

885
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,424
Grab the circuits and pull them.

886
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,329
80 seconds to attack and count.

887
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:12,716
70 seconds to attack and count.

888
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:20,362
Come to the microphone.

889
01:15:20,405 --> 01:15:22,451
60 seconds to attack and count.

890
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,707
Terrestrial Council, emergency channel.

891
01:15:24,837 --> 01:15:26,618
Answer please.

892
01:15:28,138 --> 01:15:29,833
Colonel Deering online.

893
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,223
I'm Dr. Theopolis.

894
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:35,568
Yes doctor. Where are you?
Why are you calling here?

895
01:15:35,655 --> 01:15:37,827
I'm aboard the Draconia ship.

896
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:41,042
I followed Captain Rogers as
I was ordered. Listen out.

897
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:44,648
The Draconia is not...
I repeat, it is not an unarmed ship.

898
01:15:44,735 --> 01:15:46,734
It's full of bombers
ready to launch...

899
01:15:46,864 --> 01:15:49,540
a large-scale attack
on the Inner City.

900
01:15:49,748 --> 01:15:52,425
Where did they come from?
His platform was empty.

901
01:15:52,555 --> 01:15:56,726
- Send the fighter squadrons now!
- Thank you Doctor. Good luck.

902
01:15:58,116 --> 01:16:00,071
Dr. Huer, permission
to send the fighters.

903
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:08,066
20 seconds to attack and count.

904
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:11,324
Battle positions.

905
01:16:16,842 --> 01:16:18,406
Prepare for the launch!

906
01:16:21,925 --> 01:16:25,357
- Ten seconds to attack.
- Prepare to attack.

907
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:28,842
Eight, seven, six...

908
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,831
five seconds for the launch.

909
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:34,133
Four three...

910
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,349
two one.

911
01:16:36,436 --> 01:16:38,044
Attack!

912
01:16:50,426 --> 01:16:53,119
What's going on? What happens?

913
01:16:56,856 --> 01:17:00,071
- Our ships simply exploded.
- It is impossible!

914
01:17:13,539 --> 01:17:15,146
Here the Earth Council.

915
01:17:15,234 --> 01:17:18,058
Attack the bombers;
Us, to the main ship.

916
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:23,923
There are no bombers.
They explode as soon as they come out.

917
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:25,617
That makes no sense.

918
01:17:27,137 --> 01:17:29,441
Take out our warships!

919
01:17:37,217 --> 01:17:41,344
Prepare to intercept.
Do not use combat computers.

920
01:17:41,432 --> 01:17:42,475
I unplug it.

921
01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:47,861
Ladéate to the right!
I shot him!

922
01:18:08,324 --> 01:18:12,626
Two come below.
I'll shoot the one above.

923
01:18:14,364 --> 01:18:17,057
I go after the other.

924
01:18:53,943 --> 01:18:55,551
Take that and that!

925
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:58,853
Oh, hell.

926
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:13,363
You will be responsible for the
damage suffered by this platform.

927
01:19:35,826 --> 01:19:37,737
I am very sorry that you have come to this.

928
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:47,426
In the center and inside!

929
01:19:49,425 --> 01:19:53,030
Preparation for transmission
with King Draco.

930
01:19:53,117 --> 01:19:56,854
In the name of the kingdom,
what is happening?

931
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:01,155
Are they attacking when my
ships are still hours away?

932
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:03,631
I only obey orders.

933
01:20:03,718 --> 01:20:07,324
And the orders of whom you obeyed?

934
01:20:07,532 --> 01:20:09,236
Those of your daughter, sir.

935
01:20:09,323 --> 01:20:14,145
Did he order our ships to
disintegrate upon entering combat?

936
01:20:15,362 --> 01:20:19,054
If either of them survives the
greatest disaster in the kingdom...

937
01:20:19,142 --> 01:20:23,138
They will give me accounts!

938
01:20:26,918 --> 01:20:31,219
Stop fighting the fighters, we
will destroy the mothership.

939
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,729
Emergency.!

940
01:20:50,032 --> 01:20:52,729
Emergency.! Emergency!

941
01:20:52,938 --> 01:20:55,637
This was his work, your highness.

942
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,155
I should leave her to
burn with the ship...

943
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:03,543
But I want her alive so she can
render an account to her father.

944
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,628
I have an emergency
ferry ready to go.

945
01:21:07,931 --> 01:21:11,624
It will bring us close enough
to his father's ships.

946
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:17,837
Emergency.! Emergency!

947
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:29,046
Emergency.!

948
01:21:32,739 --> 01:21:34,434
Emergency.! Emergency!

949
01:21:37,909 --> 01:21:39,647
The ship is going to explode.

950
01:21:39,734 --> 01:21:43,862
Remove the ships from the impact area.
Theo, I'm going for you and Twiki.

951
01:21:43,905 --> 01:21:45,999
Forget us. Save Buck - Buck?

952
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:49,857
Wilma, he destroyed the
entire fighter fleet alone.

953
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:53,072
- He sent us to warn you.
- See me on the flight deck.

954
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:55,549
We'll find Buck.

955
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:03,630
Emergency.! Emergency!

956
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:07,235
Theo, Twiki, over here!

957
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,927
I'm glad to see you again, Buck.

958
01:22:12,058 --> 01:22:15,707
- This powder magazine is going to explode.
- Help is on the way.

959
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:18,619
- How do you help?
- Wilma will come to rescue us.

960
01:22:18,705 --> 01:22:21,225
What? You can not land here. He will die.

961
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:38,560
Emergency.! Emergency!

962
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:42,427
- Will explode.
- Over here, Buck. Through the smoke.

963
01:22:53,723 --> 01:22:57,199
Cab! Cab!

964
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:05,931
- Let's move on. The powder magazine is going to explode.
- I have the same opinion. Get up.

965
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,832
Very well done.

966
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:37,908
Thank you. But we are
not out of danger yet.

967
01:23:54,548 --> 01:23:58,067
We would already be the
rulers of the Earth...

968
01:23:58,275 --> 01:24:00,030
if Buck Rogers had not tackled!

969
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,715
He would not have been necessary
if you were more man.

970
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:12,057
We owe you more than an
apology, Buck, especially me.

971
01:24:12,143 --> 01:24:15,228
I confess that I thought the
princess had coaxed you.

972
01:24:15,358 --> 01:24:19,356
Well, I'll say that she had the
best pair of... horns in the dance.

973
01:24:19,442 --> 01:24:21,572
Yes, it was an attractive hat.

974
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:26,489
You will never be as man as Buck Rogers.

975
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:30,347
We'll see when we see Mr.
Rogers again.

976
01:24:30,435 --> 01:24:35,561
- And we will.
- I hope so.

977
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:40,696
Buck...

978
01:24:40,905 --> 01:24:44,554
I know I've been distant with you and cold.

979
01:24:44,642 --> 01:24:47,726
I was afraid, afraid to get involved.

980
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,853
Now things will be
different between us.

981
01:24:52,939 --> 01:24:55,069
I'm not just a professional.

982
01:24:55,155 --> 01:24:57,415
I am as woman as the princess.

983
01:24:58,631 --> 01:25:00,064
How good.

984
01:25:00,152 --> 01:25:03,541
And, from now on, I'll show you.

985
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,626
What?

986
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:08,710
Well, I guess we'll
never see Kane again...

987
01:25:08,841 --> 01:25:10,535
nor the princess.

988
01:25:18,442 --> 01:25:20,441
The eyes in front.

989
01:25:20,571 --> 01:25:24,698
- You will get sick.
- Buck, I like you very much.
