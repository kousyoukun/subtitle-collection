anything I've seen in the star system.

- Kane, please.

68
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,927
He was frozen by a combination of gases.

69
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,841
Oxygen, cryogen, ozone, methalon.
Almost a perfect balance.

70
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,010
These are techniques used
throughout the galaxy for terminal illness.

another matter. The man's ship.

Kane, you have one more minute.

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,523
His instrumentation was stopped.
Frozen solid in the year 1987.

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,531
- Are you telling me...
- That the man may be 500 years old.

75
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,281
- You're serious.
- Yes.

76
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,726
Frozen by elements so instantaneous and perfect
that he is fully preserved and living.

77
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,842
What a fascinating thought.

78
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,971
- Preserved young or preserved old?
- Very young.

79
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,243
Any defects from the ordeal?

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,285
Fortunately for him,
we're quite advanced in cryogenics.

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,125
Well, I've never met a 500-year-old man.

82
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,246
- Prepare him for an audience.
- I'm afraid he's liable to be incoherent.

83
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,123
I'll make allowances.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,607
- Where am I?
- We ask the questions.

85
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,449
Who are you?

86
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,689
Captain Buck Rogers,
United States Air Force.

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,927
- Who are you?
- What did he say?

88
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,567
Something about a United States.

89
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,763
Captain, what is your destination?

90
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,207
- What is it?
- My head.

91
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,167
- Anybody got an aspirin?
- What does he mean?

92
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,090
Probably some kind of anti-pain drug.

93
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,851
Give him something for his discomfort.

94
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,562
What is this place?

95
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,767
Where am I?

96
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,565
- Who are you?
- You're on the King's flagship Draconia,

97
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,649
under command
of the Royal Princess Ardala.

98
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,682
Oh.

99
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,448
- Who?
- Where are you from?

100
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,008
Wait. Slow down.
What was that about a ship?

101
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,931
One of the King's star fortresses
on its way to Earth on a peace mission.

102
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,088
On its way to Earth?

103
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,321
You mean you guys aren't from...

104
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,647
I mean, we're not...

105
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,729
We're not on... Earth?

106
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,723
- I'm definitely going to need an aspirin.
- Give it to him.

107
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,331
What is that?

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,966
Captain?

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,291
Bear in mind you're a captive of a dynasty
that conquered three fourths of the universe.

110
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,688
You will answer carefully
if you value your life.

111
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,682
Mm.

112
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,204
Are you a real live princess?
(Laughs hysterically)

113
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,723
I think we've given our captain
too much medication.

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,163
No, I feel great.
(Continues chuckling)

115
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,401
The United States of America

116
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,762
was an empire on the planet Earth
some centuries ago.

117
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,371
Those royal tutors gave you
your money's worth.

118
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,051
You're from Earth, Kane.
You should know better than I.

119
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,243
The United States perished
almost 500 years ago.

120
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,170
That would account for his spacecraft,
his clothes.

121
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,048
I have a better explanation. He's a clever
plant from the Federal Directorate of Earth.

122
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,731
- A Plant?
- Yes, a spy.

123
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,967
Placed in our path by their military.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,686
They wouldn't dare. We come as an envoy
from my father's kingdom.

125
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,045
I am fully aware of your father's stated
purpose, to guarantee trade with Earth.

126
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,129
What reason could they have
for placing a spy on board?

127
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,326
- To search our ship, to see if we're armed.
- I see.

128
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,445
- We couldn't allow that, could we?
- No.

129
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,088
Then I'm to assume that I may
dispose of Captain Rogers as I see fit.

130
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,202
How you handle security
is your prerogative. Come on, Tigerman.

131
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,089
What a layout. Wow.

132
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
- How are we this morning?
- Terrific. This is a coincidence.

133
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,407
- I got a ship just like this.
- Disconnect the medication.

134
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,681
Don't do that. I really love that.

135
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,761
- You'll be on your way shortly.
- Where?

136
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,768
- You're going home.
- Where's that?

137
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,041
- On Earth.
- Right.

138
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,243
Your ship has been serviced
and reprogrammed to take you home.

139
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,161
- I'm sure you must be anxious.
- Seems like I haven't been there in weeks.

140
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,722
Whoa!

141
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,091
I've had a great time with you guys.
You know, I'm going to miss you.

142
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,920
I've got a great idea.
Why don't we all go down there together?

143
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,804
You go on ahead.
We'll be along in a few days.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,482
Not if I wake up.

145
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,929
Bye-bye. Boy, what a dream this is.

146
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,327
Boy, they're going to be surprised back at
Houston when I come back with this story.

147
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,611
'Prepare to launch alien vessel.

150
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,764
Whoo-wee!

151
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,121
(Kane) He's given us an opportunity
to test the Earth's defence shield.

152
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,566
Test it? We know that anyone entering
Earth without a clearance is incinerated.

153
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,243
But if our captain's a spy, as I believe,
they will escort him through the shield,

154
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,648
along the narrow channel
only known to their military.

155
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,163
- How can this help us?
- I've hidden a transmitter aboard his ship.

156
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,329
It will send back the equivalent
of a guide map.

157
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,763
When we give the signal, it will be used
by your father's attack forces

158
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,802
to pour through their defence shield.

159
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,323
- What if Captain Rogers is not a spy?
- Then he will burn.

160
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,003
- I see.
- You don't look very pleased.

161
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,646
Of course I'm pleased.

162
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,289
I just have the strangest feeling
I'm going to see Captain Rogers again.

163
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,887
♫ Chicago, Chicago, you're my kind of town

164
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,527
♫ Chicago, Chicago, I'm going...

165
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,168
- 'Air Control 1 to vessel...'
- 'This is Traffic Control, vessel Tartalian.

166
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,807
'What is your current position
and fuel supply?'

167
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,004
'This is Tartalian to Air Control.
We are approximately...'

168
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,681
'♫ They do things
they don't do on old Broadway...

169
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,567
'Houston Control, this is flight 711.
Come in, Houston Control.'

170
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,922
Put down your backgammon boards.
Lucky Buck is back.

171
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,882
Sir... super?

172
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,008
'Super on. What station is this?'

173
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,328
Delta sector, sir.
You don't hear from me very often.

174
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,885
Yes, Delta sector.

175
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,641
My scanners monitor the low-frequency
direct communication band.

176
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,489
'I'm picking up some voices.'

177
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,844
I'm sure you're picking up pirate chatter.
Nothing to be alarmed about.

178
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,205
Echoes from the attack on our freighters.
Those signals will bounce around all week.

179
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,370
Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.
This isn't an echo, sir. It's a voice.

180
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,971
A strong voice. It's singing.

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,128
- Singing?
- Yes.

182
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,322
- Delta sector, did you say singing?
- Yes.

183
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,762
Operational control, this is supervisor 14
on the floor. Feed me the Delta sector.

184
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,486
'♫ Won't you come home, Bill Bailey,
won't you come home?

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,211
'♫ You've been gone the whole night long'

186
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,403
♫ Remember that rainy evenin'

187
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,442
♫ I threw you out...

188
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,767
(Whistling)

189
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,723
Come in, Houston Control.

190
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,880
'Houston Control, this is flight 711.

191
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,164
'Come on, you guys, give me instructions.
I'm on final re-entry.

192
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,241
'Come in, Houston Control.
Houston Control, do you read me?

193
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,447
'Come on, you turkeys, get off your duffs
and give me some info.'

194
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,724
Practically a foreign language.
Could it be some kind of joke?

195
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,802
(Alarm)

196
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,441
He's heading directly for the defence shield.
Get me Intercept.

197
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,889
Intercept Squadron on the line, please.

198
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,481
Colonel Deering.
What are the coordinates?

199
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,643
Retard the shield 100 miles
until we verify the craft.

200
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,682
(Alarm continues)

201
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,170
Alert. Intercept airborne.
Position of alien craft.

202
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,361
- Very odd.
- 'What's odd?'

203
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,651
Target is moving unusually slow and erratic
for any conventional spacecraft.

204
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,722
I have target in visual sight.

205
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,925
What is it?

206
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,003
Hey, all right? Nice seeing you...

207
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,451
guys.

208
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,927
Who are you?

209
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,327
What are you?

210
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,681
'Attention, alien spacecraft, do you read?'

211
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,611
Watch who you call alien. You don't
look familiar yourself. Who are you?

212
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,247
Please restrict your answers to yes and no.
You are in grave danger.

213
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,691
From who, you?

214
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,883
'You are traversing a corridor
into our Inner Cities.'

215
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,684
Inner what? Look, lady...

216
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,722
Colonel Deering. Please be quiet.

217
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,800
If you deviate from my orders, you will be
burned into vapours. Do you understand?

218
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,007
Vapours? Yeah, I understand. What do I do?

219
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,964
- 'You have manual override capabilities?'
- Sure.

220
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,607
- Then follow me very closely.
- Be right on your tail.

221
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,970
We really blew it this time.
Gotta be the Russians.

222
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,371
- 'You're doing just fine.'
- Da svidaniya.

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,051
- I beg your pardon?
- Just trying to be friendly.

224
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,721
Violating our airspace
is an act of war, not friendship.

225
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,571
Wait till the guys at the Cape hear this.

226
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,570
Buck Rogers sets down
in the middle of Red Square.

227
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,922
'Air Control 1 to Access.

228
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,443
'Clear on corridor 1-0,
able for incoming vessel.'

229
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,125
'Confirm. Area is clear for approach
on corridor 1-0, able for incoming vessel.'

230
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,322
Hey, babe, this is quite a setup.

231
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,011
Colonel Deering,
commander of Earth's defences.

232
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,520
- You're in charge?
- That's right.

233
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,691
- If there are no more questions...
- Take it easy. I'd fly with you any time.

234
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,208
- Take this barbarian in for interrogation.
- What?

235
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,684
Hey, wait a minute.

236
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,449
Wait.

237
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,402
What are you doing? Hey, wait!

238
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,882
(Beeping)

239
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,401
How do you do, Captain Rogers?

240
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,087
My name's Dr Huer
and I'm very pleased to meet you.

241
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,169
What's going on? Where am I
and what are you doing to me?

242
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,330
We're studying you.
It's all electronic and painless.

243
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,081
But so far we're as boggled as you are
by what's happened.

244
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,885
Your testing is producing phenomenal data.

245
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,006
Terrific, but what is happening? If I'm
dead, I obviously didn't make it to heaven.

246
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,328
- Just what planet is this?
- It's Earth, of course.

247
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,171
You returned as your mission required
to almost the precise landing area

248
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,487
originally programmed into your ship.

249
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,330
Look, doc, I've been through a lot.

250
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,287
But there is no way you can tell me that
city out there is anything like Chicago.

251
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,961
No, it isn't. There's nothing
like Chicago left on Earth.

252
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,446
Allow me to bring in
my administrator Dr Theopolis.

253
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,482
Now, look, doc...

254
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,808
Twiki, would you bring in
Dr Theopolis, please?

255
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,369
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi.

256
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,442
- What is that?
- This is Twiki.

257
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,324
- He's your drone.
- My what?

258
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,605
Well, for the duration of your debriefing
and determination, Twiki will be your aide.

259
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,171
And this is Dr Theopolis.
Good morning, Dr Theopolis. Lovely day.

260
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,202
Thank you. I did my best.

261
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,005
Dr Theopolis is a member
of our computer council.

262
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,410
In addition, he's responsible for all our
environmental controls within the Inner City.

263
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,047
I'm introducing a pale hint
of mauve into the sunset.

264
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,722
Not so deep as an amethyst, but
the more subtle burn texture of cinnamon.

265
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,003
- How nice.
- I hope our captain can watch it with us.

266
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,691
It's truly going to be lovely.

267
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,610
If I were you, I'd check
on whoever is programming that thing.

268
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,601
It is we on the council
who do the programming for the entire city.

269
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,123
And kindly reserve your opinion.
Shall we get down to cases?

270
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,203
Captain Rogers, I'll leave you
with a word of advice.

271
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,326
These Quads are not programmed by man.
They've been programmed by one another.

272
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,203
You see, the mistakes we have made,
in areas like our environment,

273
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,167
have been entirely turned over to them
and they've saved the Earth from doom.

274
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,570
Bringing us back, so we will not have to
depend on other planets for food and water.

275
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,447
The Quads are not human,
but you can hurt their feelings.

276
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,804
It's this sensitivity that separates them
from mere machines.

277
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,681
So I'll see you again
in approximately 16 hours.

278
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,927
16 hours! Wait a minute!

279
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,328
Do you think
I'm going to talk to a box for 16 hours?

280
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,528
Sit down, Captain. Let's both try
to be as pleasant as possible.

281
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,562
That's a good fellow.

282
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,730
Twiki, place me on the table
where I can get a good look at the captain

283
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,206
while you get him some liquid refreshment.

284
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,605
Bidi bidi bidi bidi.

285
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,723
- I don't need any liquid refreshment.
- You do.

286
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,322
You're dehydrated from your ordeal, Buck.
If I may call you Buck.

287
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,527
Run along, Twiki,
and get Captain Rogers his drink.

288
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,723
Well, now, what an attractive man you are,
Captain Buck Rogers.

289
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,971
Now, look, I've been waiting 24 hours
to find out where I am,

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,641
who I am, who you are...
Can I have some answers?

291
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,605
Certainly, Buck. That's why I'm here,
to answer your questions.

292
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,244
Great, let's have it.

293
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,320
You're Captain Buck Rogers. According
to your ship's log, you left Earth in 1987.

294
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,011
That much I know.
Tell me what I don't know.

295
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,127
If preliminary data holds up, it appears
you have returned to Earth 504 years later.

296
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,049
You are now in the 25th century.

297
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,882
Buck? Are you all right, Buck?
Did you hear me?

298
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,845
- Buck?
- I think I will have that drink now.

299
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,446
Bidi bidi bidi bidi. Le'chaim!

300
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,325
(Theo) You can take my word.
He's a wonderful man. Believe me.

301
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,931
I believe you believe he's a wonderful man,

302
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,443
but you're not being asked to risk our few
surviving warriors on his subterfuge.

303
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,689
He's only one man.
What can he do to endanger us?

304
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,371
He could discredit the treaty with Draconia.

305
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,644
But he has made no such attempt.
He comes to us a bewildered man.

306
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,843
I would like the opportunity
to spend time with him.

307
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,248
Finding fault with his testimony
is a waste of your time.

308
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,968
Saving Earth is not a waste of time despite
having to endure the captain's company.

309
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,520
Well, if Dr Theopolis
has no objections, I have none.

310
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,767
I have no objections.

311
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,168
Then the captain
belongs to me until I expose him.

312
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,726
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi.

313
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,971
(Theo) I have not seen Colonel Deering
so emotional about anything before.

314
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,922
Nor anyone.

315
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,328
This part seems
more of a dream than a nightmare.

316
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,447
Look, I was a little out of it yesterday.
I'd like to apologise.

317
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,642
I accept your apology, Captain.

318
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,927
Tell me about the Holocaust.

319
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,008
I can't.

320
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,169
Well, until I hear it and feel it, it isn't real.

321
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,130
I lost everything that was important to me.

322
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,607
Mother, father, brother, sisters,
a woman I cared for.

323
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,201
Until something convinces me different,
they're waiting for me now,

324
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,481
somewhere else in time and space.

325
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,686
- What's it like on the outside?
- You wouldn't like it.

326
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,529
Radiation?

327
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,803
In some places.
Ruins and scorched earth everywhere else.

328
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,923
So we're dependent on trade
with other planets.

329
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,442
This trade agreement with the Draconians,
what's it about?

330
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,326
We're being stewed out by pirates
who choke off our shipping lines.

331
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,163
The Draconians promise to keep our supply
lines open in return for landing privileges.

332
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,329
I'd like to see my ship. Is that possible?

333
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,522
Anything is possible, Captain.

334
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,447
Those guards thought we were crazy
coming out here at this hour.

335
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,370
I've had enough sleep to last me a lifetime.

336
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,641
Do you recognise these markings?

337
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,331
Common for an aircraft
that had been in combat.

338
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,409
I wasn't in combat.
Did your ships fire on me?

339
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,091
- Certainly not.
- Then whose did?

340
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,283
- Possibly pirates.
- Then why am I still here?

341
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,961
Why didn't they finish me off,
strip the ship or at least open it?

342
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,243
You'd think pirates
would check out an unarmed ship.

343
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,443
Particularly one they bothered to fire on.

344
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,687
You were in flight a long time.
Anything could have happened.

345
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,566
Those burns are fresh.
The cordite is still unoxidised.

346
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,447
I think Princess Ardala's fighters fired on
me before they towed me aboard her ship.

347
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,565
- Her ship is unarmed. That is the law.
- She seems to be bending it.

348
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,329
What would you suggest?

349
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,207
Thoroughly searching her ship before
you allow it inside your defence shield.

350
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,562
An insulting way to begin
an alliance based on good faith.

351
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,571
Good faith is for bureaucrats
and what gets you a city with a lid on it.

352
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,650
I'd go up there armed to the teeth,
otherwise you'll be sitting ducks.

353
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,846
For a man whose expertise is five centuries
old, you seem quite opinionated.

354
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,083
You're right. It's none of my business
how you blow up your world.

355
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,124
We didn't know what we were doing either.
Good night.

356
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,811
- Where are you going?
- To look around the city.

357
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,447
- You're under suspicion.
- I want to see what's changed.

358
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,280
- That's forbidden.
- It's a free country. At least it was.

359
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,166
You're still under arrest and my prisoner.
I can't let you go.

360
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,330
- You'll have to shoot me to stop me.
- You leave me little choice.

361
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,771
- You didn't have to come with me, Theo.
- I wanted to be with you.

362
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,840
I wish you'd listen to reason. This is
nothing compared to what lies ahead.

363
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,371
Why don't we stay here for the night?

364
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,883
We'd freeze to death. What warmth
you feel emanates from the Inner City.

365
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,563
In a few hours, they cut power by two thirds.
It will drop well below zero out here.

366
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,004
Well, it's straight ahead, then, I guess.
I'm just sorry I brought you into all this.

367
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,931
I was assigned to be with you.
No one forced me into your camp.

368
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,611
- I believed in you and I still do.
- Bidi bidi.

369
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,007
- What did he say?
- You don't want to know.

370
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,451
Oh.

371
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,925
Bidi bidi bidi.

372
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,327
- What's he saying?
- You don't want to know.

373
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,806
Go back. I can put up
with whatever's out there

374
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,207
if it helps me find out about my people.

375
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,242
I'll be with you, Buck.

376
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,408
Bidi bidi bidi.

377
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,807
- What did he say?
- You don't want to know.

378
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,289
- Stop saying that. I want to know.
- He thinks we're being watched.

379
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,721
It's just his imagination. Come on.

380
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,931
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
- We'll be all right.

381
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,010
- It isn't you they're after.
- What?

382
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,649
No of fence, but it's us. My gold circuits
bring a lot of money on the black market.

383
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,924
As for Twiki, well, I hate to tell you
the use they'll put him to.

384
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,962
Where are you going?

385
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,162
My God, this is it.

386
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,766
I don't mean to impugn your strategy, but
standing in the middle of the street is stupid

387
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,802
under the circumstances.

388
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,409
- Come on.
- Bidi bidi bidi.

389
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,649
(Theo) I don't know where he's going.
Just follow him.

390
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,770
Bidi bidi bidi.

391
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,168
I don't know what he's doing.
Just follow him, Twiki.

392
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,728
(Gasping and shrieking)

393
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,722
Bidi bidi bidi. Holy...

394
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,923
I know, Twiki. I see them. Just keep going.

395
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,366
- (Screech)
- Bidi bidi bidi.

396
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,803
Don't think thoughts like that.
You'll run down your batteries.

397
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,568
This is where my parents are buried.
At least I know part of it.

398
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,251
We can't stay long. We're being followed.

399
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,009
(Moaning)

400
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,646
What happened?
There's only one stone. No date.

401
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,251
Only a few fortunate ones were buried.

402
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,682
It happened so fast.
Families were buried together.

403
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,042
Dates became unimportant
as all systems broke down.

404
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,447
Finally, there were no more armies,

405
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,246
only starvation, contamination
and lingering death.

406
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,847
- I wish I'd been with them.
- You can't go back, Buck.

407
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,771
The past is gone, but you can
still help us with our future.

408
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,290
Bidi bidi bidi bidi.

409
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,004
If there is a future. I'm afraid it's too late.

410
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,722
Take off, Twiki.

411
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,002
(Shouting)

412
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,970
Bidi bidi.

413
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,649
Look out!

414
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,763
- Bidi bidi.
- You dirty...

415
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,048
(Shrieking)

416
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,931
There's just too many of them. It's hopeless.

417
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,570
If anyone has any last words,
I think now would be the time for them.

418
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,243
Bidi bidi bidi. Let's get out of here.

419
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,044
- Bidi bidi.
- (Gunshots)

420
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,165
(Screeching)

421
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,361
(Crash)

422
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,924
Well, what brings you out
on a night like this?

423
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,851
Captain, I came to find you
at some personal risk.

424
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,882
- Very ballsy.
- Very what?

425
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,369
Forget it. Don't expect any fanfare. We were
fine until you came along. Right, Theo?

426
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,402
- Well...
- Forget it, Theo.

427
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,330
- Bidi bidi bidi.
- At least Twiki's on my side.

428
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,490
I like it here. It's primitive,
but it is the south side of Chicago.

429
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,320
- We're wasting time. Let's go.
- I'm not through looking yet.

430
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,684
- So unless you shoot me...
- You got away once, but not this time.

431
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,602
(zap)

432
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,362
What's wrong?

433
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,050
- It's true. He is working for the pirates.
- I still don't believe it.

434
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,291
You stand alone. The microtransmitter was
attached to his navigational equipment,

435
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,971
revealing our access corridors
to our enemies.

436
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,402
That's not the behaviour
of an innocent man.

437
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,685
- First I thought he was guilty and then...
- You're being subjective in your evaluation.

438
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,964
- I support him for very practical reasons.
- What are they?

439
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,450
I'm convinced of one thing. Captain Rogers
has indeed met the Princess Ardala

440
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,051
and has been aboard
the Draconian flagship.

441
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,880
His descriptions are too precise
to be the guesswork of a pirate.

442
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,208
Perhaps the pirates have been
aboard her ship and told him.

443
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,561
My dear, they are deadly enemies.

444
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,561
It is unlikely that any pirate could
survive such a visit to tell about it.

445
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,286
Word from Earth on Captain Rogers' fate.

446
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,927
His ship was intercepted and led down,
as I expected.

447
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,768
Did the transmitter provide
the necessary information

448
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,610
to bring my father's forces
through their shield?

449
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,325
Yes, but the transmitter
has been discovered.

450
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,408
- Too bad.
- It makes no difference.

451
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,002
Once we're welcomed inside,
we'll destroy the shield from within.

452
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,443
Won't they be suspicious when Captain
Rogers tells them he was aboard our ship?

453
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,962
They won't believe him.
Captain Rogers is as good as dead.

454
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,441
Now, stop worrying about the trial.

455
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,963
I'm a member of the council
and I'm going to defend you personally.

456
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,527
Thanks, Theo. It's nice
to have at least one friend.

457
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,485
- Bidi bidi bidi bidi.
- I'm sorry, Twiki. Two friends.

458
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,211
The computer council is ready
to hear arguments

459
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,849
in the case of the Directorate versus
Captain Rogers on charges of espionage.

460
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,168
- Councillor Apol.
- The state's case is elemental.

461
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,330
Captain Rogers piloted a foreign aircraft
with a microtransmitter,

462
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,125
revealing our shield borders
to our enemies.

463
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,367
What price, you may ask,

464
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,645
what bounty would Captain Rogers consider
just in selling out the human race?

465
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,808
Only his pirate friends can answer.

466
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:45,200
But in my opinion, it is the destruction
of the treaty with Draconia that they seek.

467
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,323
For its enactment spells their doom.

468
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,681
The state rests its case.

469
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,850
We will now hear from the defence.
Dr Theopolis.

470
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,407
Distinguished colleagues,
you have heard the evidence

471
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,330
and I challenge you to find this man guilty.

472
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,843
No evidence has been found to suggest
his claim to a birthright on this planet

473
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,569
because we all know full well, no records
exist prior to the Great Holocaust.

474
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,686
He has no explanation for the transmitter,
because it was not his doing.

475
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,327
He is an innocent pawn in a great war.

476
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,163
I say to you, my colleagues, that if you find
this man guilty, you must find me guilty.

477
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,250
My sensors tell me that this man is good.

478
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,409
The defence rests. Thank you.

479
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,809
Captain Rogers, have you any last words
before we pass judgement?

480
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,446
Just that I'm an innocent pawn, puppet...
Call it what you will.

481
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,801
Somebody else pulled the strings.

482
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,845
You'd be better advised to worry less
about me and more about them.

483
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,521
Cos I can do you no more harm,
no matter what the outcome today.

484
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,323
But he or she could destroy you.

485
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,087
Very nice, Buck.
We don't have a thing to worry about.

486
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,567
By unanimous vote,
the council finds for the state.

487
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,286
Captain Rogers, the council finds you guilty.

488
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,687
Your life is to be terminated.

489
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,088
Said termination
to be carried out immediately.

490
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,968
This council is adjourned.

491
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,802
I don't believe it.

492
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,131
Aren't you going to say anything?

493
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,323
- No.
- That's ridiculous.

494
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,170
You have been sentenced for termination.

495
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,809
At the very least, I would think a man of your
sort would fly into a rage, lash out at me.

496
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,446
- Say something.
- Goodbye.

497
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,202
- Buck, stop it. You're being unreasonable.
- I'm being unreasonable?

498
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,401
It's as if you don't think
the sentence will be carried out.

499
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,684
I don't think there's going to be
anyone around to carry the sentence out.

500
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,722
I know you people won't be in charge.

501
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,890
You're still clinging to your story
about the Draconia bearing arms.

502
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,922
I can prove it.

503
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,808
What would you say if I told you
that I came here to give you that chance?

504
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,169
How?

505
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,606
By flying out to meet the Draconia flagship
to verify your story about them finding you.

506
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,883
And do a little looking around
while you're there?

507
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,490
Exactly.

508
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,443
No, no, I don't like that plan.

509
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,483
- It worries me.
- Why?

510
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,251
You see, I'm scheduled for termination.

511
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,760
If I miss it, I might get in a lot of trouble.

512
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,486
You are impossible. I'm offering you
your life and you give me jokes.

513
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,367
That's the point. Are you offering me
termination of my termination

514
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,323
or just postponing it?

515
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,450
If you can prove that your story is true...

516
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,642
Let's go.

517
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,442
Stay close to my wing.
We'll keep manoeuvres simple.

518
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,882
Stay on auto flight.
Don't run anything but the throttle.

519
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,084
Thanks, Colonel. Is it all right
if I occasionally look out the window?

520
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,001
This is no time for levity. We've lost a third
of our ships in this vector to pirates.

521
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,088
When they hit, they hit fast.

522
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,648
You can't outfly the computer.
It will take any necessary evasive action.

523
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,607
- If you try to fly it, you'll only cost us a ship.
- I appreciate your concern.

524
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,371
I just wish
I'd brought along something to read.

525
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,210
I make a target vector 4-0-1.

526
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,846
'Roger, Colonel. I have a visual on target.'

527
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,044
If you have visual at this distance,
it must be gigantic.

528
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,723
Permission to come aboard? Why?

529
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,127
A special envoy.

530
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,242
That's all I know.

531
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,127
It isn't according to protocol.
What do you think they have in mind?

532
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,323
I don't know,
but they gave us plenty of warning.

533
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,522
There'll be nothing to betray us.

534
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,803
I'd be curious to know
what they have in mind.

535
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,208
Let's prepare
a very special welcome for them.

536
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,803
Send out our pirate ships
and arrange a little surprise for them.

537
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,291
Welcome aboard the flagship Draconia,

538
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:16,283
envoy of Draco, conqueror of space, warlord
of Astria, ruler of the Draconian realm.

539
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,642
I give you his daughter Princess Ardala.

540
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,843
Delighted. This is an unexpected pleasure.

541
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,531
We're hardly prepared to greet you properly.

542
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,169
Consider your time adequate greeting. I'm
Colonel Deering of the Earth Directorate.

543
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,443
I believe you already know Captain Rogers.

544
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,964
But no. If I'd met so dashing a captain,
I'm sure I would have remembered vividly.

545
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,531
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

546
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,927
I think you're mistaken, Princess.

547
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,489
I never forget a knuckle.

548
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,809
- Captain.
- We're here to get to the bottom of things.

549
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,961
Would you like me to describe
some of your inner chambers?

550
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,651
Of what inner chambers does he refer?

551
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,684
She may not find me memorable,
but I'll never forget her.

552
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,291
I liked the dress with the high-necked collar.

553
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,484
Colonel Deering, what is this all about?
Why are you here?

554
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,367
The pirate forces are at their worst here.
We wanted to assure your safe arrival.

555
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,689
'Alert. Draconia under attack
by hostile ships.'

556
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,088
- And Captain Rogers says...
- 'All personnel to posts.'

557
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,925
- Men, to your ships.
- Alert all stations. Secure the ship.

558
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,767
So this is how you bid us safe conduct?
At least we will all perish together.

559
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,643
(Alarm)

560
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,250
'Clear all launch pads for attack. Alert.'

561
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,402
(Alarm continues)

562
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,084
(Rapid fire)

563
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,122
Look out. He's on your tail.

564
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,203
Pull up. I'll head him off.

565
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,329
You're diving into his power.

566
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,369
- I ordered you to stay out of this.
- You need all the help you can get.

567
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,289
- Bandit at 12 o'clock high.
- 12 o'clock what?

568
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,449
Lieutenant, disregard.
Captain Rogers, get off the air.

569
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,881
Our combat computers
are way ahead of you.

570
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,482
If your computers don't do something fast,
then where will you be?

571
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,087
Watch out, Thornberry.

572
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,843
- Colonel, go to manual flight.
- 'Stop distracting our pilots.'

573
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,611
'There's a couple of pirates on your tail.'

574
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,050
I'm switching to manual
to dish out what we've been taking.

575
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,082
I'm ordering you back to the base.

576
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,645
Now, then, let's see how you like
a little old-fashioned red-dogging.

577
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,646
One sack, six to go.

578
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,362
Gotcha.

579
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,651
- Take it down and into retros.
- It's against all principles of combat.

580
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,891
That's called blitzing your linebackers.

581
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,850
'I don't know what went wrong
with our combat computers, but thank you.'

582
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,091
Now, Captain, let's go home.

583
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,131
- My place or yours?
- 'What did you say?'

584
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,891
- 'Just joking.'
- 'Air Control 1 to Access.

585
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,323
'Clear on corridor 1-0,
able for incoming vessel.'

586
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,442
'Sir, area is all clear for approach
on corridor 1-0, able for incoming vessel.'

587
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,208
Colonel Deering,
have you seen Captain Rogers?

588
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,651
Yes. Why?

589
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:49,163
Our council has had a formal request
from Her Majesty Princess Ardala.

590
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,168
What has that got to do with him?

591
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,569
She feels he single-handedly saved
their unarmed vessel from the pirates

592
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,602
and wants to thank him personally.

593
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,725
- Single-handedly?
- Even your ship was nearly destroyed.

594
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,527
Were it not for Captain Rogers' skills
and quick thinking, the Princess feels...

595
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,451
I don't care what the Princess feels!
I know what happened. I was there.

596
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,931
Tomorrow I conquer Earth.

597
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,123
Tomorrow we conquer Earth,
Your Highness.

598
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,482
(Hum of conversation)

599
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,963
(Theo) You look magnificent, Buck.
(Twiki) Bidi bidi.

600
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,483
- (Theo) ls something troubling you?
- Why am I invited? Nobody believes me.

601
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,445
Princess Ardala wants to thank you
for fighting the pirates.

602
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,808
I'd like to have a word or two
with her myself... alone.

603
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,050
I'm sure that won't be permitted.
After all, you are only a captain.

604
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,401
And not even commissioned at that.

605
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,689
- What have you got for a headache?
- Are you ill?

606
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,371
I'm not fully recovered from that long trip.

607
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,041
Why didn't you say something?
Twiki will get you a relaxant.

608
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,411
(Applause)

609
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,241
It's time to go in now. We don't want
to keep the trade delegation waiting.

610
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,122
(Fanfare)

611
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,971
Welcome. The Draconian trade delegation

612
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,767
under the leadership of Her Royal Highness,
crown princess of the realm Ardala.

613
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,882
I bring you greetings
on this historic occasion.

614
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,006
My father King Draco would like to present
to you his own flagship Draconia,

615
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,126
filled with all the latest technology,
as a gift to symbolise a glorious new era

616
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,640
of commerce and peace.

617
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,402
Let the celebration begin.

618
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,442
(Electronic music)

619
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,082
We brought you some pills, Buck.

620
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,282
For your headache.
It's a very strong relaxant.

621
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,564
- You mustn't take more than one at a time.
- Thanks, guys.

622
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,682
I see dancing has come
a long way in 500 years.

623
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,962
Listen, I'm going to need a rose.

624
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,048
- Did you say rose?
- A red one.

625
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,529
- What do you need a rose for?
- Twiki, would you go get me one quickly?

626
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,090
- How do you like our presentation?
- Most impressive.

627
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,803
Did this folk dance come
all the way from her daddy's world?

628
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,411
Sorry, I don't understand your terms.

629
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,081
And I would suggest
a more respectful reference than Daddy.

630
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,567
He's perhaps the greatest leader
the world has ever known.

631
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,049
A word of caution, Colonel.
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

632
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,042
Greeks?

633
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,085
Maybe that was a little before your time.
Quite a while back.

634
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,920
Do you know the story of the Trojan horse?

635
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,123
- No.
- Well, forget it.

636
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,007
I guess I came from a time that was
hopelessly paranoid. See you around.

637
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,051
- Bidi bidi bidi. Your rose, Buck.
- Thank you, Twiki.

638
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,126
Buck, no one else is giving her flowers.
You'll make them all look ridiculous.

639
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,322
Stay close, fellas. We're next.

640
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,690
Captain Rogers,
congratulations and thank you.

641
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,520
We're very grateful to you for saving us
from those horrible privateers.

642
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,927
Not too loud, Princess. Around here,
they think I am a privateer, thanks to you.

643
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,648
Me? I hope I haven't caused you
too much embarrassment. Are you angry?

644
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,921
- On behalf of the...
- Theo...

645
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,884
Bidi bidi bidi. What a body.

646
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,929
- From me to you.
- Who's your charming little friend?

647
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,167
His name is Twiki.

648
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,047
That thing hanging around his neck is Theo,
a member of the computer council.

649
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,765
- Your Majesty.
- Join me in the next dance?

650
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,849
- The Princess does not...
- Does not mind if she does.

651
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,211
I don't think
I'm up on the latest dance steps.

652
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,087
- If you have a preference, it is my party.
- How about something old-fashioned?

653
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,602
Sir, excuse me, are you familiar with rock?

654
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,322
Try it. Come on.

655
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,601
(♫ Electronic gavotte)

656
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,770
No, that's not it. Just let yourself go.
Go with the music.

657
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,088
- ♫ Electronic funk)
- That's it. Right. Yeah.

658
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,371
- What are you doing?
- I'm gettin' down.

659
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,290
It's before your time, if it frightens you.

660
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,041
- Nothing frightens me.
- Fine. Get down and boogie.

661
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,168
Bidi bidi bidi.

662
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,921
- It's expressive.
- It's disgusting.

663
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,922
What happens if we bump together?

664
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,042
We become man and wife.

665
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,482
Bidi bidi bidi bidi.
Groovy. Get down.

666
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,881
You're quite a man, Captain Rogers.

667
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,848
I have the feeling the Earth people believed
your story about being frozen for 500 years.

668
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,010
- Not on your life. They think I'm a spy.
- One of mine?

669
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,930
- They're not sure.
- Want to join up?

670
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,167
Who do I have to see to make my move?

671
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,725
Me.

672
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,481
Tell me, that building,
is it still the communications centre?

673
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,807
- That would be secret information.
- Of course.

674
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,888
(Laughs humourlessly)

675
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,370
I will always be one of you, Dr Huer.
Perhaps I will remain here permanently.

676
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,004
We hope so.

677
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,963
Your Highness, the ministers
would like a few minutes.

678
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,607
- Later, Kane.
- Business of the realm comes first.

679
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,486
Your father expects you
to serve the best interests of the realm.

680
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,731
If you don't,
he has 29 other daughters that will.

681
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,363
It's been a pleasure, but I'm afraid
our duties are cut out for us.

682
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,609
Later, perhaps?

683
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,849
I depart aboard
my private launch at midnight.

684
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,002
I'll be there.

685
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,327
Captain Rogers, I wonder if this
wouldn't be a good time to talk with you.

686
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,970
Princess Ardala left so abruptly
and the party seems to be over.

687
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,002
You don't have any plans, do you?

688
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,565
Well...

689
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,171
Good. I have something I would like to say.

690
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,843
- Well...
- I thought you were a spy, Captain Rogers.

691
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,962
I was wrong.

692
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,082
Would you like to go someplace?

693
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,565
I'm... not up to that yet.

694
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,604
I've been out of it for quite a while.
500 years.

695
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,007
I've got to go easy on re-entry.

696
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,642
(Spaceship approaching)

697
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,042
♫ Chicago, Chicago, you're my kind of town

698
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,367
- (Growls)
- ♫ Chicago, Chicago...

699
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,528
It's all right.

700
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,282
- Listen to her. She's making sense.
- I asked Captain Rogers to join us.

701
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,809
Lucky for you she called me off.

702
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,451
We're almost there.

703
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,131
- Where are you going?
- Bidi bidi.

704
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,811
I know it's chilly, but we've got no choice.

705
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,447
Our orders are to stay close to Buck
and he may need us.

706
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,450
- So back in the cooler.
- Bidi bidi bidi.

707
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,404
Twiki, I'm speaking to you.

708
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,444
Bidi bidi.
I'm freezing my ball bearings off.

709
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,563
Captain Rogers is just not to be found.

710
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,410
What do you expect from a primitive?

711
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,011
We'll let you know if we hear anything.

712
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,767
You are a spy, Buck Rogers.

713
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,291
And I know exactly where you are.

714
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,202
Out.

715
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,209
They make better pets
if you have them fixed.

716
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,642
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
Pour us a drink.

717
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,882
At last we're alone.

718
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,211
Have you nothing to say?

719
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,210
Up until now I didn't know
what I'd been missing.

720
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,882
- I have a confession as well.
- There's somebody else back home?

721
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,321
I didn't realise what I was missing.

722
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,369
You're different. You're arrogant.

723
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,725
You disregard orders and you're the kind
of man who could unseat my father.

724
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,570
Your father's seat
is the furthest thing from my mind.

725
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,082
- I brought you here for a reason.
- I was counting on that.

726
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,364
- I want you by my side.
- That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

727
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:35,442
Consider it. You have no idea what it's like
being the daughter of Draco the Conqueror.

728
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,643
29 sisters nipping at your heels.

729
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,407
Weaselly little courtiers like Kane
vying for power.

730
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,330
But with a man, a real man like yourself...

731
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,405
I could defy my father.
I could live my own life.

732
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,203
- A magnificent new dynasty.
- Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves?

733
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,891
I'll take that drink now.

734
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,042
- We have to be very careful.
- Do we?

735
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,923
Mm-hm.

736
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,611
The timing is not good.

737
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,440
Things never change.
That's the way it's always been.

738
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,801
Why couldn't I have met you sooner?

739
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,161
We've got plenty of time, don't we?

740
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,165
'All armament personnel, report to
flight bay to begin loading weaponry.'

741
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,362
(Kane) Look at them. They're sleeping.

742
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,563
The fools will never know what happened.

743
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,723
I'm so relaxed.
Would you turn out the lights?

744
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,120
If you're a spy, I'll have to kill you.

745
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,891
That's an example of your best pillow talk?

746
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,082
I think I've found your problem.

747
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:35,201
This is no good, Twiki.
There are soldiers everywhere.

748
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,847
We don't even know where
to begin to look for Captain Rogers.

749
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,971
(zap)

750
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:18,443
Holy gee!
See if we can find your jammies now.

751
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,844
The pirate ships. That's how
they attacked us. It was her own people.

752
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,482
(♫ Whistles Chicago)

753
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,931
- Where's Tigerman?
- I don't know, sir.

754
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,602
(Knocking)

755
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,404
Go away.

756
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,562
Did they wake you, my darling?

757
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,411
Did they wake you, my little babykins?

758
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,925
(Screaming)

759
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,371
Blast it!

760
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,722
Get out! Get him out!

761
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,560
- Get him out! Execute him!
- No. Remove him for questioning.

762
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,083
- You countermand my order?
- Under the circumstances, yes.

763
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,122
Do as I say.

764
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,922
Take him.

765
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,647
- You have a lot of explaining to do.
- I have explaining to do?

766
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,041
It's not Gucci, but what the hell?

767
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,966
Bidi bidi.

768
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,368
I don't want to get caught either,
but something is wrong

769
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,562
and we've got to find out what it is.

770
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,491
Bidi bidi.
I hope you know this violates my warranty.

771
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,206
You have quite obviously
been... preoccupied.

772
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,289
I will deal with you for your insolence later.

773
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,448
Give the order to attack at once.

774
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,643
We cannot attack
without your father's forces.

775
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,887
Kane, you're spineless!

776
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,766
We do not need my father.
We have the element of surprise.

777
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,407
We can wipe out the Inner City
and the defence shield.

778
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,923
By the time my father's forces arrive, we'll
be sitting on the throne of the Earth.

779
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,804
At least I will,
since you don't have the nerve.

780
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,522
All right. We will attack.

781
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:23,603
A wise decision, Kane. Meanwhile, Captain
Rogers is loose somewhere on this ship.

782
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,529
Find him.

783
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,242
'Alert.

784
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,523
'Hostile intruder aboard ship. Alert.'

785
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,000
(Alarm)

786
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:42,444
- Bidi bidi bidi bidi. It's Buck.
- He's wearing the uniform of the enemy.

787
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,241
This will warm your tail.

788
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,725
Those are warships out there.
That means the treaty is a hoax.

789
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,367
But we can do
one last service for our country.

790
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,562
We can deal with Captain Rogers.

791
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,164
'Six minutes to attack and counting.'

792
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,160
'Five minutes to attack and counting.'

793
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,529
- Don't move, Captain Rogers.
- What are you doing here?

794
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,884
- This isn't going to be pleasant.
- Get out of here. I've got work to do.

795
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,968
We can see that, you traitor.

796
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,244
- Can't you see what's happening?
- Someone's about to bomb Earth.

797
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,011
- Do you recognise these ships?
- I don't see...

798
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,610
They're pirate ships.

799
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,883
Why would they be aboard
a Draconian flagship?

800
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,527
Sorry. You'll have to do better than that.
Come with us...

801
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,608
'Four minutes to attack and counting.'

802
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,211
Look, you load of electronic gibberish.

803
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,484
Have you heard of loading bombs
into the tailpipe of a rocket ship?

804
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,366
- Bidi bidi.
- You be quiet, Twiki. I'm getting confused.

805
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,007
I can help. There are no pirate ships.
There never were.

806
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,203
Those are Draconian bombers
disguised as marauders.

807
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:17,882
They've been harassing your shipping lanes
to force you into a treaty with Draconia.

808
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,491
Of course. It's ingenious, if true.

809
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,170
'Three minutes to attack...'

810
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,329
You've got ten seconds.
Do you believe in me or Kane?

811
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,443
- Some choice.
- What about yourself?

812
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,801
- Do your circuits tell you I'm on the level?
- Yes.

813
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,447
Why don't you go along
with your initial instincts?

814
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,963
All right, but only on the condition
you help us get to a communicator

815
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,809
so we can warn the Inner City.

816
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,047
You'll have to do that on your own.

817
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,004
I've got to make sure
none of these ships can launch.

818
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:50,170
Commander Kane, we found
a guard unconscious in bay 3.

819
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,363
- 'Two minutes to attack...'
- We've run out of time.

820
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,440
- They found the guard I wiped out. Go.
- We'll do our part. Good luck, Buck.

821
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,401
Take me over to the console, Twiki.

822
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,927
Now, grab the middle panel.

823
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,611
'90 seconds to attack and counting.'

824
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,770
(Theo) Drop it.
Grab the circuits and pull them.

825
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,131
Bidi bidi.

826
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,002
Aaargghh!

827
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,127
'80 seconds to attack and counting.'

828
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,881
'70 seconds to attack and counting.'

829
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,602
Put me close to the microphone.

830
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,961
'60 seconds to attack and counting.'

831
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,891
'Earth Directorate,
emergency channel, come in, please.'

832
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,287
- Colonel Deering online.
- 'This is Dr Theopolis.'

833
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,369
Where are you? How did you
get on this emergency channel?

834
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,607
I m on board the flagship Draconia

835
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,723
'I followed Captain Rogers as ordered.
Please listen.'

836
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,287
The Draconia is not, repeat not,
an unarmed vessel.

837
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:22,247
She is filled with bombers preparing
to launch an attack against the Inner City.

838
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,647
But how? Her landing bay was empty.

839
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,490
Scramble your fighter squadrons at once.

840
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,923
Thank you, Doctor. Good luck.
Dr Huer, permission to scramble fighters?

841
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,201
'20 seconds to attack and counting.'

842
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,284
Battle stations.

843
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,564
Fighters prepare to launch.

844
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,602
(Engines power up)

845
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,722
'Ten seconds to attack and counting.'

846
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,171
Stand by to attack.

847
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,446
'Eight, seven, six...

848
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:06,726
'five seconds to launch,
four, three, two, one.'

849
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,364
Attack!

850
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,209
Aarrgh!

851
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,811
What is it? What's going on?

852
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,449
- Our ships simply explode.
- That's impossible.

853
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,723
This is Earth Directorate. Attack bombers
as they launch, and the main ship.

854
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,326
There are no bombers to attack.
They're exploding as they emerge.

855
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,964
That doesn't make sense.

856
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,442
Get our warships out there!

857
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,051
Prepare to intercept.
Do not use combat computers.

858
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,128
Disengaging

859
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,287
Draconian on your wing. I'll get him.

860
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,487
Two coming up from below.
I'll jump the one on the top.

861
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,250
I've got the other one.

862
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,210
Take that and that.

863
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,765
Haaargh!

864
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,404
Shit.

865
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,242
Right, I'm going to hold you responsible
for any damage done to this bay.

866
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,884
(Evil chuckle)

867
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,930
(Roars)

868
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,922
Arrgh!

869
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,882
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

870
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,922
(Howling)

871
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,882
(Panting)

872
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,922
Bottoms up.

873
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,443
'Prepare to transmit image of King Draco.'

874
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,280
What in the name of the realm is going on?

875
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,166
You are attacking
while my ships are still hours away!

876
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,567
I...was just following orders.

877
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,925
- And just whose orders were you following?
- Your daughter's, sir.

878
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,602
Did she order our ships
to disintegrate as they enter battle?

879
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:44,160
If either of you survive this greatest debacle
our realm has known, you'll answer to me!

880
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,050
All squadrons,
prepare to finish off the mother craft.

881
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,047
'Emergency.'

882
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,084
- (Alarm)
- 'Emergency. Emergency.'

883
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,563
- This was your doing, Your Highness.
- (Explosion)

884
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,888
I ought to leave you here
to burn up with the ship.

885
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,890
But I want you alive to answer to your father.

886
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,083
I have an emergency escape shuttle
ready to leave.

887
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,965
It will take us far enough away
to reach your father's ships.

888
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,003
'Emergency. Emergency.'

889
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,249
'Emergency.'

890
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,282
Argh!

891
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,649
'Emergency. Emergency.'

892
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,608
'The ship is ready to blow.'

893
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,690
Withdraw all ships from the impact area.
I'm going to get Theo and Twiki.

894
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,927
- Forget us. Save Buck.
- Buck?

895
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,407
'He single-handedly destroyed
their entire fleet of warships.'

896
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,489
- He sent us to warn you.
- Meet me on the flight deck.

897
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,841
- We're going to find Buck.
- Bidi bidi.

898
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,408
'Emergency. Emergency.'

899
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,563
- Theo, Twiki, over here!
- Bidi bidi bidi.

900
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,608
It's good to see you again, Buck.

901
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,201
- No formalities. This magazine will blow.
- Help is on the way.

902
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,050
- What do you mean, help?
- Wilma's coming.

903
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,526
She can't land here. She'll be killed.

904
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,730
Aaargh!

905
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,081
'Emergency.'

906
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,886
- It's time to go.
- This way, Buck. Through here.

907
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,730
'Emergency. Emergency.'

908
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,083
(Twiki) Taxi cab! Taxi!

909
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,443
- Let's go. That magazine's about to blow.
- Get in.

910
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,802
'Emergency. Emergency. Emergency.'

911
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,043
'Emergency. Emergency.'

912
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,811
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

913
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,081
But we're not in the clear yet.

914
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:12,441
We would be rulers of Earth now
if you hadn't let Buck Rogers on board.

915
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,962
He wouldn't have been necessary
if you were more of a man.

916
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,083
We owe you a great deal more
than an apology, Buck.

917
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:26,887
Especially me. I confess I thought
the Princess had you beguiled.

918
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,766
Well, I will say she had
the nicest set of horns at the ball.

919
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,928
Yes, it was an attractive hat.

920
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,846
(Princess) You'll never be
the man Buck Rogers is.

921
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,211
We'll see when we meet Mr Rogers again.

922
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,370
- And we will.
- I hope so.

923
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:54,962
Buck, I know I've been
aloof towards you and cold.

924
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,163
I was frightened, afraid to get involved.

925
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,565
Mm-hm.

926
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,888
Things are going to be
different now between us.

927
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:07,323
I'm not all business. I'm every bit
the woman that the Princess was.

928
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:13,201
- That's nice.
- From now on, I'm going to prove it to you.

929
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,330
- What?
- I guess that's the last we'll see of Kane.

930
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,885
And the Princess.

931
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,762
Twiki.

932
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,802
Bidi bidi bidi bidi. Uh-oh!

933
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,643
Eyes forward. You'll get star sick.

934
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,490
Bidi bidi bidi.
Buck, you're my kind of guy.

935
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,610
♫ Far beyond the world I've known

936
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,325
♫ Far beyond my time

937
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,607

01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,683
♫ For some truths to reveal

943
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,802
♫ What thoughts are fantasy

944
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,005
♫ What memories real?

945
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:34,001
♫ Long before this life of mine

946
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:39,171
♫ Long before this time

947
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,569
♫ What was there?
Who cared to make it begin?

948
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,488
♫ ls it forever

949
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:50,047
♫ Or will it all end?

950
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,367
♫ Searching my past

951
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,290
♫ For the things that I've seen

952
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,322
♫ ls it my life

953
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:02,571
♫ Or just something I've dreamed?

954
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,525
♫ Far beyond this world I've known

955
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:46,160
♫ Far beyond my time

956
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:52,007
♫ What kind of world am I going to find?

957
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:57,763
♫ Will it be real or just all in my mind?

958
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,090
♫ What am I? Who am I?

959
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,361
♫ What will I be?

960
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,528
♫ Where am I going

961
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:10,521
♫ And what will I see? ♫
