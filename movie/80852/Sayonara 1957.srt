1
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:35,453
Sayonara

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:46,464
Sayonara

3
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:55,890
Sayonara

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:31,193
Sayonara

5
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:37,908
Japanese goodbye

6
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,441
Just like a bird!

7
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,001
How many did you get, sir?

8
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,920
Hey, he got two more!

9
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,963
-Four? Old Gruver got two more...

10
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,924
Nice going there, sir!

11
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,227
Mmm-hmm.

12
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,813
Now, let's try the other lung. Breathe.

13
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,526
- Breathe.
- Hi, padre.

14
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,696
- Breathe.
-Two more MiGs today I hear, Lloyd.

15
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,906
Yeah.

16
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,201
Yeah, that's it. You can put it on.

17
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,369
Okay-

18
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,414
Well, Ace, you've had it.

19
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,958
Say what?

20
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,377
You're through flying, for a while, anyway.

21
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,712
Oh, no, nothing wrong with me

22
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,048
a little bottle of beer isn't going to fix up.

23
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,259
Give him a bottle of beer
and send him back out.

24
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,220
Look, now,
just don't get yourself excited here.

25
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,721
Don't get pale, Gruver.

26
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,890
I was just giving you a rib.

27
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,101
But you could use some sleep.

28
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,771
Yeah, I could use a little nice Korean sleep.

29
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,856
Mmm, better than that.

30
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,317
You're going to Japan.

31
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,779
I'm going to Japan? What for?

32
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,072
Why not?

33
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,993
Wouldn't you like to tango with one
of those beautiful Japanese dolls?

34
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,369
Well, if it's your prescription, Doc,

35
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,122
then I'll certainly work at it the best I can.

36
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,416
You're going to Kobe.

37
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,918
Kelly has your orders.

38
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,587
What in the world am I going to do in Kobe?

39
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,214
Well, it's a special request

40
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,301
of General Webster himself.

41
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,389
Then this has all been pre-arranged.

42
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,975
Pre-arranged? Demanded.

43
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,312
Why shouldn't a three-star general

44
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,522
look out for a four-star general’s son?

45
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,190
Now, don't be getting on my back.

46
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,775
I ain't bucking for favors.

47
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,153
I know you're not. I was just kidding.

48
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,321
I'll see you, Doc. Thanks.

49
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,239
Could I have a word with you, Gruver?

50
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,408
Yeah, I'll bet you I know what the word is.

51
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,660
K-E-L-L-Y. Is that true or false?

52
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,078
He's got permission to go back

53
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,997
and marry that Japanese girl.

54
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,667
Well, I told him he can't
take her back to the States.

55
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,669
I explained the law in detail myself.

56
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,589
But there's no law
which says he can't marry her.

57
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,507
And he's appealed to his congressman.

58
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,260
His congressman?

59
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,262
I wish you'd
talk to him.

60
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,473
After all, he is one of your men.

61
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,600
And you're the only human being
he looks up to.

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,435
Now, listen, I...

63
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,103
You know, I'm going to tell you something.

64
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,646
That boy don't look up to anybody.

65
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,900
He has been promoted four times

66
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,110
and busted right back again.

67
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,864
Yeah, my congressman.
Shocking, ain't it, Major?

68
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,908
Chaplain says, "Don't marry the girl."

69
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,618
Colonel says, "Don't marry the girl."

70
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,703
You say, "Don't marry the girl."

71
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,081
Congressman says,
"You marry that girl, Kelly."

72
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,624
What can I do?

73
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,459
I'll tell you what you can do, boy.

74
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,128
You can go home
and marry your congressman.

75
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,963
You'd be better off.

76
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,466
Give me more coffee.

77
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,676
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,307
Hear you bagged two more today, Major.

79
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,976
- Yes.
-How was it up there?

80
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,853
Oh, it was splendid.

81
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,859
What's the matter? What happened?

82
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,325
There was a guy
with a face in one of those planes today.

83
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,952
Well, there was a guy with a face

84
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,829
in all the other seven you shot down.

85
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,499
Yeah.

86
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,169
That's exactly what
I've been thinking about.

87
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,672
Well, you can stop thinking.

88
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,967
You got a very well-written contract here.

89
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,554
General Webster's had you assigned

90
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,140
to the Interservice
Aviation Board over there.

91
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,351
Which means
you've got practically nothing to do

92
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,603
except, of course, marry
the General's daughter,

93
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,689
who is arriving in Kobe tomorrow.

94
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,359
You mean, Eileen...

95
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,527
That's right.

96
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,112
General’s wife
and daughter both, from Tulsa.

97
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,822
Listen, don't fool me now.

98
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,073
I'm not fooling, Major.

99
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,951
You're not supposed to
know anything about it. Big surprise.

100
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,371
Eileen’s coming to Kobe.

101
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,457
Yeah.

102
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,460
General Webster
arranges it for you to marry his daughter.

103
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,754
My congressman
arranges it for me to marry my girl.

104
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,965
Generals for the officers,

105
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,925
congressmen for the peasants.

106
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,220
Listen, I'm glad you brought that up, boy.

107
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,222
Because I think there's a little bit

108
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,558
of difference that we ought to talk about.

109
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,059
What do you mean?

110
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,811
Well, now, listen.

111
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,398
I never did show you
a picture of my girl, did I, Kelly?

112
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,483
No.

113
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,903
Well, I'm gonna show you a picture of a girl.

114
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,906
It happens to be my girl,
but she's American.

115
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,825
And I want you
to take a long, long look at her

116
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,078
because I believe that maybe you've forgot

117
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,080
what an American girl looks like.

118
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,833
And this girl I'm going to show to you

119
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,336
is, first of all, an American girl,

120
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,088
a girl with fine character,

121
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,257
a girl with good background,

122
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,302
good education, good family, good blood.

123
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,805
I've known this girl
since I was about that high.

124
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,933
Our families are very close.

125
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,353
I've been engaged to this girl
for a long time, Kelly.

126
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,564
Now, she's a girl of unusual character

127
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,650
and I'd like you to take a look at her,

128
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,236
a close look, and tell me what you think.

129
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,446
Tell me what your feeling is.

130
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,411
Kind of beat-up, ain't she?

131
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,121
I beg your pardon?

132
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,334
No, that... The beat-up one's
her mother, you idiot. Not...

133
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,962
Here's Eileen now. Wait...

134
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,297
That's... Now, now.

135
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,468
Hey. Boy, she sure
does something wicked to a bathing suit.

136
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,639
Well, she has an enormous capacity
to fulfill a bathing suit.

137
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,432
-I can see that.
-That's enough, that's enough.

138
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,310
Listen, I'm just,
you know, showing it to you,

139
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,981
but all kidding aside,
the reason I want to show you this girl...

140
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,108
Hey, you ever seen Katsumi?

141
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,609
Where's that?

142
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,111
It's not a "Where's that?"

143
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,654
That's the girl I'm marrying.

144
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,156
Oh. Well, no.

145
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,492
I mean,
I don't know Japanese names.

146
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,661
That's all right. Forget it.

147
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,750
- Well?
- -Oh, yeah.

148
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,212
Looks like a bright girl.

149
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,339
She's a whole lot brighter than me.

150
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,175
Well, that ain't too hard to do, you know.

151
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,221
Listen, Kelly,
I want to say something seriously to you.

152
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,681
Don't you think you're taking a risk

153
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,308
in marrying this Japanese girl?

154
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,768
Risks don't scare me any.

155
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,731
Look, Major, the Army and the Air Force
and the State Department

156
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,108
have all ganged up
to keep me from getting married.

157
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,359
Oh, hold on, Kelly.

158
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,194
I mean, what do you mean ganged up?

159
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,488
Here, look at these pamphlets.

160
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,783
"Think it over, Americans.

161
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,037
"Things you are required to know and do
before marrying Orientals."

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,163
Yeah.

163
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,081
Here's another piece of garbage.

164
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,375
"But will your family accept her?"

165
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,710
Will they, Kelly?

166
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,503
I ain't got any family.

167
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,549
Listen, Kelly, I haven't
got anything against this girl of yours.

168
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,427
I haven't got anything against
the Japanese anymore.

169
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,137
I mean, not really.

170
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,723
But, you know, when...

171
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:45,354
I just don't understand
how a normal, average American...

172
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,690
I mean, let's put it this way.

173
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,567
I think even your friends are gonna

174
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,111
put you down if you marry this girl.

175
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,322
If the friends I got are that kind,

176
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,200
they won't be friends of mine much longer.

177
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,785
Look, Major,

178
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,703
I'm gonna marry my girl if I have to give up

179
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,705
my American citizenship to do it.

180
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,292
Oh, Kelly, you stupid, ignorant slob!

181
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,794
I mean, go ahead and marry

182
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,838
this slant-eyed runt if you want to.
It'll serve you right.

183
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,090
Now, wait a minute, Major!

184
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,925
Don't talk to me that way!

185
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,803
I won't take that from you or anybody else!

186
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,017
I'm sorry, Kelly.

187
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,687
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,941
I'm just blowing my stack a little today.

189
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,778
But, boy, I mean it. I...

190
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,115
I want to tell you, when you tell me

191
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,034
that you're gonna give up your citizenship

192
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,246
for a girl, I mean any girl,

193
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,040
I think you're nuts.

194
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,501
I mean, I think you're crazy.

195
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,961
I am crazy.

196
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,963
I'm in-love crazy.

197
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,798
I think you're going to cut your throat

198
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,092
and I'd just hate to see you do it.

199
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,594
And I mean this with all sincerity.

200
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,722
Maybe that's because you don't feel

201
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,224
as strong about your girl as I do mine.

202
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,941
There's your orders, Major.
See you on the plane.

203
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,156
Okay-

204
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,165
Kelly.

205
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,007
Well, we're coming in, Major.

206
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,176
There's the Inland Sea. Beautiful, ain't it?

207
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,385
Yeah.

208
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,472
Boy, it sure is
nice scenery out there.

209
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,475
That's Kobe over there.
You see it, with all the docks?

210
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,517
Oh?

211
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,852
You know, what you're
looking at, Major,

212
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,271
really is three cities, you know,
all running together.

213
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,815
There's Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto.

214
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,692
They got Kabuki there.

215
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,235
What's Kabuki?

216
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,237
You never heard
of Kabuki theater?

217
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,198
- No.
- All men, no dames.

218
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,617
That's going to be dull, isn't it?

219
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,368
Oh, I don't know.

220
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,496
Well, if it's all dames you want,

221
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,790
I think we're going to get there in about...

222
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,792
Yep. Look down there.

223
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,045
See that? See that little park over
there with the little lakes around it?

224
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,630
That's Matsubayashi.

225
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,173
- Where?
- Right down in there.

226
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,716
- -You see it?
- Oh, yeah.

227
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,385
The Matsubayashi girls
are the most famous girls in all of Japan.

228
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,804
You know, they sing, they dance,

229
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,722
they act all the parts, no men.

230
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,307
Katsumi knows all the actresses.

231
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,683
She's like a movie fan or something.

232
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,852
Listen, you're just blowing your top

233
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,979
about seeing Katsumi, aren't you?

234
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,272
Carrying on.

235
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,774
She's my girl, Major.

236
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,582
Well, GG, good to see you.

237
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,792
So long, Lloyd. Lots of luck to you.

238
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,253
Oh, good enough. Thank you. Bye-bye.

239
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,423
Lloyd! Lloyd, here we are!

240
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,259
- Lloyd!
- Come on.

241
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,760
Hey, there!

242
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,220
Don't forget to act surprised.

243
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,056
Yeah. Hi, there! Hot dog!

244
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,101
Oh, won't he be surprised!

245
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,228
-Major?
- Yeah. Huh?

246
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,148
How about being my best man?

247
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,864
Now, listen, Kelly, I told you
that I'm against this marriage.

248
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,285
It would mean a lot to me.
What do you say, Major?

249
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,208
Okay-

250
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,087
Consul’s Office, 10:00, Saturday.

251
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,637
Well, come on, honey. Hurry up.

252
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,103
Well, now, hello! Come here, you!

253
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,480
-Ha, ha! You're good...
- Bless your heart.

254
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,065
-Certainly good to see you.
- Hi, Lloyd.

255
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,609
Hi, sir. Nice to see you.

256
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,776
You know, I was getting off the plane.

257
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,695
And I said, "There's General Webster
standing over there.

258
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,822
"But who is that good-looking woman?"

259
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,741
Listen, tell me about Eileen. How is she?

260
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,911
Oh, she finds Tulsa terribly dull
without you, Lloyd.

261
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,747
Well, you know, I think...
I wish she could have come along.

262
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,124
Oh, now, Lloyd,
you couldn't expect us to bring her out here.

263
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,334
Well, I know that, but...

264
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,377
You're registered at the hotel
with us for the first few nights,

265
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,296
but you'll be stationed
out here at the field after that.

266
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,505
I see.

267
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,049
Come on, let's go. Now, you get in first.

268
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,216
No, you go ahead, Mrs. Webster, honey.

269
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,594
- No, you get in first.
- No, no, you got...

270
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,720
- Go on. Get in!
-No, no.

271
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,388
Ladies first. What's the matter with you?

272
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,851
Hi, Lloyd.

273
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,104
You devil.

274
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,231
Come here. Mmm-mmm!

275
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,363
Mmm.

276
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,157
I'm glad to see you, darling.

277
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,541
I forgot what an ugly girl you got here.

278
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,378
Lloyd, she's not ugly. She's a beautiful girl.

279
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,630
What are you talking about?
She's the ugliest girl I ever saw.

280
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,966
- Come here, you.
-Oh.

281
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,760
And that dress, I think it's terrible.

282
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,680
It just goes in and out... That's awful.

283
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,807
It's meant to go in and out.

284
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,475
I go in and out.

285
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,936
Well, we'll talk about that later.

286
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,659
Send Major Gruver's
luggage up to his room, will you?

287
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,327
That's beautiful, isn't it?

288
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,246
Are there any rules against it?

289
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,456
Oh, no, there are no rules against it.
But it's understood...

290
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,208
I thought the club would be honored!

291
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,295
Please, Mike, let's go.

292
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,298
What's she doing here?

293
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,591
Mother!

294
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,427
Well, isn't she with that young officer?

295
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,928
You know, this is a...

296
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,888
Kobe's a recreation center.

297
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,223
That's right, dear.

298
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,268
It degrades the uniform.
It's out-and-out fraternization.

299
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,436
Mother, she's beautiful.

300
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,771
All the more reason. Mark?

301
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,025
-Colonel Crawford?
- Yes, sir?

302
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,568
Let's get out of this clip joint.

303
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,778
Just a minute, Captain Bailey.

304
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,947
What's the trouble?

305
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,116
Oh, I didn't mean
to bother you with this, General.

306
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:17,078
But Captain Bailey here
is wanting to take her into the club.

307
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,247
General Webster, sir.

308
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,793
This young lady is one of
Japan's most famous dancers.

309
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,004
She's no ordinary...

310
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,465
Yes, I understand.

311
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,593
Even so, don't you realize

312
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,429
this club is only for American personnel?

313
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,847
Now...

314
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,101
We've been pretty easy
about fraternization in this area,

315
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,812
even though there are
very strict orders against it.

316
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:48,193
But, when an officer
who should be an example...

317
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,986
Am I to understand, sir,

318
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,322
that you personally refuse to allow me

319
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,657
to take this young lady into the club?

320
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,995
I understand how you feel, Captain,
and I'm very embarrassed.

321
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,331
But I'm sorry.

322
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,499
Thank you.

323
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,125
Thank you, sir!

324
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,710
Don't you know that there's such a thing

325
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,337
as insolence through manner?

326
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,006
Thank you, sir.

327
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,517
Well, come on in, boys.
Eileen has to change.

328
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,520
Oh, Lloyd, Eileen’s taking you
to the Kabuki tonight.

329
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,687
Oh, good.

330
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,980
We met Mr. Nakamura, the head actor,

331
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,649
and he invited her to come.

332
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,859
Now, Kabuki, isn't that the place
where there are no dames

333
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,529
and the men play all the women parts?

334
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,697
Oh, that's right.
The way they do at Princeton.

335
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,032
Come on, Mark.

336
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,450
Gonna be fun. Come on, baby.

337
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,773
You bring your lunch?

338
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,367
Miss Eileen Webster.

339
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,452
Who'd you find there?

340
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,455
Oh, that's Nakamura.
He's the one I met. He's very famous.

341
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,415
- That Nakamura?
- Uh-huh.

342
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,794
It's about a lady who turns into a lion.

343
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,340
He's going...
She's going to turn into a lion right here?

344
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,633
Uh-huh.

345
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,468
I want to see that.

346
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,158
I love you, Lloyd. I love you terribly.

347
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,912
I always have, and I guess I always will.

348
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,665
I love you, honey.

349
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,210
Awful glad you're here, too.

350
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,681
Everybody acting like nobody
ever kisses a woman.

351
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,805
She wouldn't be half so ugly

352
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,516
if she didn't stick her face
in that flour barrel.

353
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,642
She?

354
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,770
Well, whatever it was.

355
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,565
You got me.

356
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,325
He's a male actress.

357
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,202
It says here they've been
trained since childhood

358
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,579
to have the grace of a woman,

359
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,997
and yet the power of a man.

360
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,415
Oh, my word.

361
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,086
My Lord, that's my father!

362
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,076
Is he man enough now for you, Lloyd?

363
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,621
Is that the same fellow?

364
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,914
Uh-huh.

365
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,476
All right, boy.

366
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,156
I am sure it must be very difficult

367
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,827
to enjoy theater so different from your own.

368
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,454
Well, we found it fascinating.

369
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,831
I am glad.

370
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,500
Kabuki is very old, isn't it?

371
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,628
Mmm. Some 300 years.

372
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:45,133
I find myself becoming intrigued
by everything in Japan.

373
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,594
I should be happy to help you
know my country better

374
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,471
if at any time I can.

375
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:57,019
You did not enjoy the evening
so much, I fear, Major Gruver.

376
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,022
Oh, yeah, I thought it was a fine play.

377
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:05,570
I thought maybe you could use a Marilyn
Monroe here and there, you know, to...

378
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,952
Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred

379
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,371
from Kabuki in the 17th century.

380
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,541
Well, I didn't mean to sound corny.

381
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,127
I just didn't know what to say about it.

382
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,463
Oh, please, do not apologize.

383
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:28,426
I am great admirer of Miss Monroe myself.

384
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,054
That's two of us. That's you and me, boy.

385
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,060
- Oh, no, don't do it to me.
- Oh, no, thank you.

386
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,688
I did real good. Thank you very much.

387
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,608
- Fine art.
-Let's go and see the garden.

388
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,693
Okay, you go on. I'll take this.

389
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,781
That's fine. Fine cooking. Very good.

390
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,666
Here you are, honey.

391
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,794
-No, thank you.
- Don't care for any?

392
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,255
Sit down, darling.

393
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,424
Mmm, you look awful pretty.

394
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,932
I've been doing a lot of thinking
with you away, Lloyd.

395
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,433
Answer me one thing.

396
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,185
What's that, honey?

397
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,270
Why aren't we married now?

398
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,774
Isn't that a silly question?

399
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,400
No, not really.

400
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,070
You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.

401
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,030
Mmm, I suppose

402
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,741
the Korean War might have a little
something to do with it, don't you think?

403
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,953
Wasn't Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?

404
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,913
Convenient?

405
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,873
What I really mean is,

406
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,086
do I mean everything to you,
as you do to me?

407
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,671
Of course you do, hon.
What are you talking about?

408
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,631
You see, I went to visit your mother

409
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,925
before I came here, there in Richmond.

410
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,051
My mother?

411
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,388
I was appalled at the loneliness
in which she lives

412
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,807
and the way your father is content to go off

413
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,850
and leave her walled up
within a circle of friends

414
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,144
while he plunges off to the war...

415
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,188
Oh, honey, now, you just hold on a second.

416
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,523
You got to remember something.

417
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,650
My father's a general, honey.

418
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,902
And besides that,
my mother wants to live that way.

419
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,445
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

420
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,822
What do you mean? Now, don't tell me...

421
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,907
No woman wants to live any way except

422
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,493
body and soul with the man she loves.

423
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,870
Lloyd, you'll never tuck me away

424
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,581
in the corner of some little town.

425
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,165
Go ahead and become the greatest general

426
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,501
in Air Force history, but love me, too.

427
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,045
But I do love you, baby, I do.

428
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,593
Well, I guess all I'm trying to say is that,

429
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,596
and I really mean this, Lloyd,

430
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,933
if what you want is a family
like our fathers have,

431
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,437
and promotion in the Air Force,

432
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,523
and position in society
like our mothers have,

433
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,860
and you marry me
because I'm pretty and smart

434
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,529
and have guts and will know the ropes,

435
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,244
then I don't think
you ought to marry me, Lloyd.

436
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,874
I'm sorry.
I guess I've been thinking too much.

437
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,004
Yeah, I think you have
been thinking too much.

438
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:31,025
Now. Now, quit it.

439
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,402
Okay-

440
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,489
Oh, I don't know, maybe things
will turn out after all.

441
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,240
What do you mean
maybe it's going to turn out?

442
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,659
Sure it's gonna turn out.

443
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,619
It's just all that nonsense you talk about

444
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,746
every time we get together.

445
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,917
Nonsense? I...
I hadn't realized it was nonsense.

446
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,502
Of course it is, honey.

447
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,212
Listen, it's all very simple.

448
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,672
Now, lookit.

449
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,425
I want a wife and a family.

450
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,427
I want a home in America.

451
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,471
And every time I think of
having a home like that,

452
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,474
I always think about it with a girl like you.

453
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,394
I mean, a girl with a good
Army background like my own.

454
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,314
What do you mean a girl like me?
I'm not a type. I'm me.

455
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,609
Oh, Lloyd, it's me you've got to love.

456
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,696
Oh, Lloyd, haven't you ever felt

457
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,364
like grabbing me

458
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,825
and hauling me off to a shack somewhere?

459
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,034
What's the matter with you?

460
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,911
You know better than that.
Of course I have.

461
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,454
Then what's holding you back?

462
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,456
Oh, Eileen,
are you ever going to grow up, honey?

463
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,999
Don't you know there's a right time

464
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,793
and a wrong time to do things?

465
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,002
Aren't you ever gonna realize

466
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,796
that you have responsibilities
to other people,

467
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,631
that you have a position to fulfill,

468
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,633
that you're not alone in this world?

469
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,677
Oh, you defend yourself like a fort!

470
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,470
Listen, no matter how I defend myself,

471
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:42,805
hon, you've got to understand one thing,

472
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,765
that I am not in a position

473
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,977
to be hauling my fiancee away
to a shack somewhere

474
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,603
like an alley cat or something like that.

475
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,814
I wasn't brought up that way.

476
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,066
You're going to do everything
that's expected of you?

477
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,777
Well, I'm certainly going to try,
I'll tell you that.

478
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,404
Well, I don't expect you to marry me

479
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,698
just because it's expected of you.

480
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,199
Listen, you know sometimes I look at you,

481
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,868
and I don't understand you.

482
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,327
I don't know what's going on in your brain.

483
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,705
I think sometimes
I don't even know who you are

484
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,832
or what... Or what you're all about.

485
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,753
Maybe you don't. Maybe you never will.

486
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,812
"...so long as ye both shall live?"

487
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,063
I will.

488
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,192
Katsumi, "Wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband

489
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,902
"to live together after God's ordinance

490
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,695
"in the holiest state of matrimony?

491
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,614
"Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor

492
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,616
"and keep him, in sickness and in health

493
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,202
"and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him,

494
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,621
"so long as ye both shall live?"

495
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,793
She will.

496
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,211
She will.

497
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,923
"If any man can show just cause

498
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,633
"why they may not be
lawfully joined together

499
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,512
"let him now speak, or else hereafter
forever hold his peace."

500
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,730
Do you realize you waive
all your legal rights in this marriage?

501
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,899
Look, I signed all the papers, didn't I?

502
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,400
You'll look after your wife on your own.

503
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,402
The Air Force is not responsible.

504
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,905
Yeah, I know.

505
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,782
Romantic, ain't it, Major?

506
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,702
Will you finish this ugly deed
and get it over?

507
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,414
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Sign over there.

508
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,333
Just a minute.

509
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,145
That's it, Mrs. Kelly.

510
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,606
Just you and me now.

511
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,160
Where do we sign?

512
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,789
May as well witness this now, Major.

513
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,541
Yeah, all right.

514
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,629
Incidentally, it was a great honor
meeting you, Major Gruver.

515
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:21,797
Well, thank you.

516
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,341
Say, tell me, Consul,

517
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,095
are all these ceremonies
conducted like that?

518
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,807
Well, we do our best
to prevent as many as possible.

519
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,143
We make the paperwork so difficult,

520
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,811
a good many of them lose steam.

521
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,187
Uh-huh.

522
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,899
Well, about how many, uh...

523
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,485
About how many Gis have gone
through this ceremony?

524
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:48,616
Oh, about 10,000.

525
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,120
Ten thousand? Well, then,
you let a few slip by you, didn't you?

526
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,288
A few, yes.

527
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,331
Mmm-hmm.

528
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,250
How's your girl, Major?

529
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,669
Oh, Eileen?

530
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,296
I haven't seen her in a couple days.

531
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:05,674
I've been... You know, I've been moving in,
getting my things arranged.

532
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:10,095
And she's been hightailing it
with the brass, socializing.

533
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,765
Major,

534
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,433
ain't you going to kiss the bride?

535
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,770
Well, sure I'm going to kiss the bride!

536
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,606
Yeah.

537
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,399
Sure.

538
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,820
Now, listen, I want you
to take good care of this boy, hear?

539
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,202
Now, here's your ticket, honey.
Don't forget it.

540
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,872
Okay, boy.

541
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,709
Thanks, Major.

542
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,419
Took a lot of guts for you
to come here today.

543
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,046
Oh, quit.

544
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,882
If you want anybody taken care of,
or need a job done

545
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,384
that you West Point guys ain't allowed

546
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,802
to do yourselves, I'm your man.

547
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,471
Hold it. Now, I'm going to call on you, boy.

548
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,681
Come on. Let's get a belt.

549
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:54,765
All right.

550
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,642
-Nice to see you.
- How are you, Lloyd, dear?

551
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,477
Fine. Just fine.

552
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,812
That's a pretty dress you got on.

553
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,105
Thanks.

554
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,065
Lloyd, sit down, son.

555
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,692
All right.

556
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,114
Thank you for coming over
so promptly, Lloyd.

557
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,242
Well, that's all right.
I was just darning my socks.

558
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,327
Lloyd, um...

559
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,914
I don't know exactly how to put this.

560
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,583
It's a little embarrassing, for me, that is.

561
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,963
I understand you were a witness
at a marriage yesterday

562
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,632
between one of your men
and a Japanese girl.

563
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,637
Yeah, one man from my outfit in Korea.

564
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,058
Well, you realize, of course,
there's an Army policy

565
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,852
to discourage all such marriages.

566
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,438
Yeah, well, I think they couldn't
have been discouraged.

567
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,606
They're very much in love, and...

568
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,027
I dare say.

569
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,821
However, the fact that you personally

570
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,072
seemed to sanction the marriage...

571
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:55,784
Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean to give that impression at all.

572
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,411
I didn't sanction it, and as a matter of fact,

573
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,204
I tried to talk him out of it before.

574
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,957
But, Lloyd, darling,
you did act as his witness.

575
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,543
Well...

576
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,129
You know, as long as
it's going to be inevitable,

577
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,673
I thought I might as well try
to make it as pleasant as possible.

578
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,134
Don't you see the position that puts me in?

579
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,304
And since I'm the Area Commander here, I...

580
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,140
No, you didn't do anything
to encourage this marriage, sir.

581
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:20,350
I believe I did all this on my own.

582
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:24,480
What do you mean on your own,
Lloyd, dear?

583
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,815
Everything you do reflects on the General.

584
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,901
After all, he is Eileen’s father.

585
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,613
I'm afraid this places me in a position
of incompetence, Mrs. Webster,

586
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,200
when it comes to, you know,
doing anything to help my own men.

587
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,495
Let's stop beating around the bush.

588
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,914
What's wrong between you and Eileen?

589
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,708
You haven't been to see her
for several days.

590
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:49,963
Well,

591
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:54,426
you talked about
being embarrassed, sir, before.

592
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,303
I'm embarrassed, too.

593
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,516
- What about?
- Well, about my whole situation here.

594
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,186
I'm a pilot, sir. I was doing a job in Korea.

595
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,648
Unfinished job. Now, suddenly,
I'm pulled off that job and sent over here

596
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,652
and plunked down at a desk
at this Interservice whatever it is,

597
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,195
and, you know, where, as far as I can see,

598
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,280
there's absolutely nothing to do.

599
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,407
You know, all so as I can be with Eileen.

600
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,827
There's nothing dishonest about it.

601
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,829
That is, if you plan to get married.

602
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,374
I think I know how Lloyd feels.

603
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,292
Do you plan to get married or not?

604
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,546
-Really, dear.
- Well, I'm her mother. I want to know.

605
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,925
Well, Mrs. Webster,

606
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,845
as of the moment,
Eileen isn't too sure about it.

607
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,346
And I...

608
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,349
Oh, we know, Lloyd, dear. Now, look.

609
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,978
There's evidently been some
slight strain between you two,

610
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,230
but don't let it become too important.

611
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,108
Now, this is Sunday night.
Why don't you call her up later

612
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,569
and ask her out to dinner or something?

613
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,903
Well...

614
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,739
Mother, I found the dearest little shop at...

615
00:35:58,866 --> 00:35:59,950
Hi, Lloyd.

616
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,785
Hello, Eileen.

617
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,079
Lloyd just came in to see you.

618
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,039
-Oh?
- Oh, yeah.

619
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,585
Listen...

620
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,922
Listen, I thought
Sunday night, and I thought maybe

621
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,842
you and I can go out
and catch a movie or something.

622
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,261
Feel like it?

623
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,765
I'm sorry, Lloyd.
I'm having dinner with some friends tonight.

624
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,058
Well,

625
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,477
what about tomorrow?

626
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,189
That's booked, too, I'm afraid.

627
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,111
Well, looks as though
I'm holding some pretty tough cards.

628
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:42,117
What about next week?

629
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,829
Of course, Lloyd. Call me?

630
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,958
Okay-

631
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,172
Mrs. Webster, General.

632
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:57,299
Goodbye, Lloyd.

633
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,134
- Bye, Eileen.
- Bye, Lloyd.

634
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,353
Oh, Eileen. Why did you tell him
you were busy tonight?

635
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,859
Because I don't want to see Lloyd Gruver
when you ask him to see me.

636
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,653
Besides,

637
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,821
I do have a date with that young Lieutenant

638
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,823
and his wife from Fort Bragg.

639
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,575
Whole bunch of us.

640
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,793
I hope you don't lose my man for me.

641
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,525
Boy, give me a martini, will you?

642
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,487
Nope, make it lemonade.

643
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,658
No, dog. Give me a scotch and soda.

644
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:06,702
- Scotch and soda.
- -Yeah.

645
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,912
Scotch and soda, sir.

646
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,790
There's such a thing as insolence
through manner, you know.

647
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,967
Well, I hate to admit it,
but I guess that's what I said.

648
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,179
Well, I thought it sounded kind of strange

649
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,598
coming from a guy
who shot down nine MiGs.

650
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,310
Well, that's kind of a reflex action.

651
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,061
I'm a West Point man, you know.

652
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,231
I guess, it sneaks out sometimes.

653
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,320
Now, listen, Captain, what does a fellow do

654
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,405
around here after the sun goes down?

655
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,782
Why?

656
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,242
You on the loose?

657
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,494
Uh... Halfway.

658
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,080
Bring him another.

659
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,876
What part of the South are you from?

660
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,296
Almost any old place
that's got an Army post on it.

661
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,925
I was all set to take the exams at West Point

662
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,261
and there was a teacher there

663
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,473
who made me take a part in a school play.

664
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:13,143
They were doing one of those
Hungarian things by Molnar.

665
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,105
You never did hear a Hungarian play

666
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,107
played in a Southern accent, did you?

667
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,068
No, I'm afraid I missed that.

668
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,862
That's a shame,
because I was awful good in it.

669
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,617
Anyhow, I suddenly didn't want
to go to West Point

670
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,620
and didn't want
to have anything to do with it.

671
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,997
And my mother come up to the school,

672
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,293
and she said,
"We always expected you to go to the Point

673
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,296
"like your father and his father before him."

674
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,882
And I told her,

675
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,512
I said I had an idea about
a whole different way of life.

676
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,680
What did she say to that?

677
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,475
She said something like,

678
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,228
"If I ever once had that idea,

679
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,730
"I shouldn't let anything stop me."

680
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:04,486
And she couldn't come right out and say,
"Don't go to the Point."

681
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,571
You know, but I know what she meant.

682
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,242
Then, of course,
my father flew up from Texas and...

683
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,827
He put you straight, huh?

684
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,705
No, he just looked at me and said,

685
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,917
"If you don't want to go to the Point,
don't go to the Point.

686
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,628
"The unhappiest men I know are those

687
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,758
"who are forced into something
they got no inaptitude for."

688
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,886
How did he force you to go to the Point?

689
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,056
That's what I'm telling you.
He didn't force me. He just...

690
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,351
We just had a little talk,
and he flew back to Texas

691
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,520
and I went on to the Point.

692
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,314
I see.

693
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,651
Well, uh, I'll tell you
something though, Mike.

694
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,656
I never once had any regrets
about going to the Point.

695
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,284
Except, just lately,

696
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,454
I've had some old feeling come back on me.

697
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,914
I don't know if I want to go on

698
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,917
in the Air Force and buck for a star

699
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,128
and get married in the Webster family

700
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,547
and get swallowed up by all that.

701
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,885
I think maybe my old lady was right.

702
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,346
Well, what does it all mean?

703
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,893
Eternal struggle, sex,

704
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,562
New York Yankees.

705
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,440
All right. Quit, now. Come on.

706
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,993
Isn't that a nice-looking bridge?

707
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,828
Yeah,
that's the Bitchi-Bashi.

708
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,246
Say what?

709
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,998
The Bitchi-Bashi.

710
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,375
Bashi is Japanese for "bridge."

711
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,128
We call this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi

712
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:48,632
because there's so much
lovely stuff that goes over it.

713
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,593
Did you say stuff?

714
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,095
Brother, I said stuff.

715
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,351
Will you kindly tell me what
we're standing in the bushes for?

716
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,603
-Can't touch it.
- Why not?

717
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,774
Well, you see, these girls that go over there
are the Matsubayashi girls.

718
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,151
They just cross over there
on the way to the theater

719
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:11,279
from those cells over there,
those dormitories.

720
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,115
Oh, that's right.
Somebody told me about that.

721
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:19,454
Hey, boy, is that anything
going over there now?

722
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,543
Hey, come on.
The goods are on display.

723
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,795
Wait for me, buddy.

724
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,035
There's Fumiko-san.
The one you saw me with.

725
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,912
- Yeah. The little one in pink.
- Yeah, that's the one.

726
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,793
You're not going over there and say hello?

727
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:10,005
What, in public?
A Matsubayashi girl? Are you nuts?

728
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,424
Well, you take her to the officers‘ club.

729
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,384
Well, that's for Americans.

730
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,512
Thought I could sneak her in there
without her being recognized.

731
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,015
What happens if they catch them?

732
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,766
Immediate dismissal.

733
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,518
- No fooling?
- Yeah.

734
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,396
No Matsubayashi girl
is allowed to have dates of any kind.

735
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,857
You were dating her, you.

736
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,234
Yeah, well, I'm different.

737
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,486
Oh, get out of here.

738
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,864
Well, like I told President Truman,

739
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,075
"Harry, you was wrong
when you sold the Marines short."

740
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,036
See, I hate to be stuffy about this, son,

741
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,871
but you Air Force men
just wouldn't understand.

742
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,122
Lord!

743
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:48,209
- Well, the Marines have got l’amour.
- Oh, Lord.

744
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,295
And these girls, they got fame and wealth

745
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,880
and bright lights.

746
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,548
But they ain't got l’amour.

747
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,425
-well, you got l’amour, haven't you?
- Yeah, yeah.

748
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,227
What's going on there now?

749
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,104
-Hana-ogi's coming.
- Who?

750
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,690
Hana-ogi. She's the top, number one.

751
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,071
Come on. Let's go.

752
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,511
Well, how come she's dressed like that?

753
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,222
Well, the tall ones play men's parts, mostly.

754
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,516
They play women's parts, too.

755
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,476
How do you do?

756
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,110
What do you say let's see the show?

757
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,612
Well, come on, Ace.

758
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,564
- Hmm?
- I say, do you follow the plot?

759
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,483
Yeah, nothing wrong with the plot.

760
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,463
Listen, are you sure
they're coming back this way?

761
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,882
Just keep yourself in check, son.

762
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,636
Am I nuts, or is she
the greatest thing I ever saw?

763
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,182
Whatever you're thinking, forget it.
You ain't going anyplace.

764
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,809
Oh, yeah? How's this for an introduction?

765
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,479
She's coming along the walk
and TIM kind of walk on by

766
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,024
and slip my arm around her, just cozy style.
What do you think of that?

767
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,776
I think we better go.

768
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,985
- Now, wait just...
- Major!

769
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,488
Hey, kiddo! How are you?

770
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,323
How's everything?

771
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,657
Saw you at the show.
We been looking for you.

772
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,493
Listen, I want you to meet Captain Bailey.

773
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,702
This is Airman Kelly.

774
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,287
How are you, Kelly? Nice to meet you.

775
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:23,081
- How do you do, sir?
- How you been, boy?

776
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,373
Oh, fine.

777
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:26,042
Hey. Here's Katsumi.

778
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,627
Hello there, Katsumi.

779
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:30,296
Say something, kid.

780
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:33,633
It is fine to see you among us tonight.

781
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,135
She's speaking better English
than you are, boy.

782
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,013
She's been taking English lessons,

783
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,057
and I've been studying a little Japanese.

784
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:42,809
Let's hear you go.

785
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,853
Uh...

786
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,649
Well, I hope he can get rid of it, don't you?

787
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,944
Means "My feet are cold."
She always laughs when I say that.

788
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,029
Listen, now you been?
How you getting along down there?

789
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,448
Oh, just fine, Major.

790
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,076
We got a wonderful house
down by the canal.

791
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,327
Hey, Kelly, didn't you tell me

792
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,122
that Katsumi knows
those Matsubayashi girls?

793
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,374
Oh, sure. She's a real fan.

794
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,877
Well, listen, I want you
to do something for me.

795
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:13,297
I am trying in the worst way
to meet this Hana-ogi,

796
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,469
and I want you to ask her if she won't,
you know, kind of introduce me?

797
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,318
She says the rules are very strict,

798
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:35,444
but she'll go over and ask her.

799
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,446
Well, she will ask her?

800
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,614
Oh, yeah.

801
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,243
‘Cause you know what I said, I said
to Truman when he came over to the house,

802
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,455
I says, "Harry," I said,
"don't ever sell the Air Force short."

803
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,757
All right, boy,
now you're going to see something.

804
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,856
Here comes Fumiko-san.

805
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,503
-Here comes Hana-ogi.
- I know it.

806
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:42,637
You ain't going to let me down, are you?
Go on.

807
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,013
- It's all right, Major.
- Hmm?

808
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,322
How do, Miss Ogi?

809
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,371
You think you made the grade, Ace?

810
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:10,456
Yes. She gave me a nice little look there.

811
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,333
Oh, she sure did.

812
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:36,315
Uh, she says that Hana-ogi
will not speak to an American.

813
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,026
Why not?

814
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:42,071
We shot her brother
and killed her father with our bombs.

815
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:43,864
Oh, shoot. I didn't do it.

816
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,076
Sure you did, Ace.

817
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,036
We all did.

818
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,163
Come on.

819
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,041
Come on, Ace.

820
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,685
Listen, if they're so strict
with you girls over there,

821
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:16,188
how come you go out
with Mike on dates and fool around?

822
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,566
It is very bad of me,

823
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,902
but I cannot help myself.

824
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,863
He's so tall!

825
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:28,993
Well, he's a big boy, all right.

826
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,287
I mean, there's no fooling about that.

827
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:33,914
But, listen,

828
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,667
what I really want to know is,

829
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,628
does this Hana-ogi ever go out on dates?

830
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:40,796
You know, like you and Mike and...

831
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:42,923
No.

832
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,051
She is number-one girl.

833
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,178
Must be specially careful.

834
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:48,429
Well,

835
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,016
I want you to do me a favor.
Now, will you do it?

836
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,644
When you go back to the dormitory tonight,

837
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,938
I want you to tell Hana-ogi

838
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,233
that Major Gruver would
like to meet her and...

839
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,569
Now wait. Now wait. Just a minute.

840
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:07,239
I just want to talk to her for a little while.

841
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,449
Now, will you do that for me?

842
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,701
Never happen!

843
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,830
Hana-ogi-san never speak men,

844
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,627
and with American, never happen.

845
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,588
Well, honey, I am here to tell you

846
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,673
that it's going to
happen.

847
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,004
Pardon me, Miss Ogi.

848
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:08,092
I wonder if I could...

849
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,969
If I could have your autograph?

850
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:21,939
Thank you very much.

851
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,126
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

852
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,398
Hi, Major.

853
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,817
I've been looking for you.

854
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,278
Hello, Mr. Kelly.

855
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,822
Wife says to be at the house tonight.

856
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,243
Now, listen, I'll tell you, boy, I've got a...

857
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:43,622
I have an engagement this evening
with a friend of mine.

858
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,002
Be there, bub. Hana-ogi's coming.

859
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,045
Sir.

860
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:55,301
- Kelly!
-Be there early.

861
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,261
Kelly!

862
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,709
- Hello.
- Hello!

863
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,004
Hey. You know where Joe Kelly lives?

864
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,632
--Over there?

865
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,091
Well, you show me, will you?

866
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,061
How do you do?

867
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:00,783
Oh. Hiya, Ace.

868
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,243
Hey, Kelly, is that you?

869
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,079
How are you, Alice?

870
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,872
-How are you, Ace? Nice to see you.
- Good. Fine.

871
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:07,998
Come in the house.

872
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,417
Wait a second.
Let me just take a check here.

873
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,127
- Did she come yet?
- No, not yet.

874
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,178
Katsumi.

875
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:31,772
- Okay.
- What did she say?

876
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,399
Don't ask me, son...

877
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,192
Hey! Off with the shoes.

878
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:37,277
You don't wear shoes in a Japanese house.

879
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,530
Okay, coming off. What about the pants?

880
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,949
The room on your right.

881
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,742
- Where, here?
- That's it.

882
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,706
Watch your head, Ace. Well, this is it.

883
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:52,918
Well, listen, this is all right, boy.
This is cute. This is nice.

884
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,379
Sit down over here, Ace. That's the
place of honor in a Japanese house.

885
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,505
Over there?

886
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,552
Listen, what's this thing?

887
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:03,637
Oh, this is an armrest.

888
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,097
Armrest?

889
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:07,307
Well, it'll be even better
when the rest of the chair gets here.

890
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,985
Hi, Katsumi, darling. How are you?

891
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,612
Yeah.

892
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,668
It is very nice to have you

893
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,504
among us.

894
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:41,341
Well, it's very nice to be among you, too.

895
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,147
Listen, I brought you a little couple of things

896
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:56,356
you can stick around the house.

897
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:58,817
Yeah, flowers.

898
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,616
You've made her very happy, Ace.

899
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:10,037
What has she got here?
We going to eat this or wear it? What is it?

900
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:15,042
No, this is a little towel
that they serve before a meal or a drink,

901
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,294
just a little refresher
for your hands and face.

902
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,379
Listen, that's a good idea.

903
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,298
Wash them up.

904
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,384
Okay, clean the ears well.
Do I pass, teacher?

905
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,889
Just dump it in the basket.

906
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:31,558
Yes, sir.

907
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,062
What's this, an eyecup?

908
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,397
We've got to wash our eyes out, too?

909
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,942
No, that's a cup for sake.
That's a wine made out of rice.

910
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,736
Rice? No fooling?

911
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,238
Yeah, no fooling.

912
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,448
- Okay, I'll try it.
-Here, taste it, you'll see.

913
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,742
Feels warm.

914
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:50,702
That's right,
we heat it up before we serve it.

915
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,413
Really? Well...

916
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:56,250
Katsumi, here's to your health.

917
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,085
And, Kelly, the very best to you.

918
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:03,715
That's all right, boy. It's not bad.

919
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,801
Told you, it's wonderful.

920
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,053
- Listen, aren't you going to have anything?
- Oh.

921
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,429
Yeah. I was just going to say, you know,

922
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,057
there's kind of a polite thing you do, like,

923
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:14,935
you take the cup
and you swish it around in the water,

924
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:17,104
and you pour some sake in it for her.

925
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:18,772
Okay-

926
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:19,940
That's right.

927
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,072
- It means "A little bit."
- Little bit, all righty.

928
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,241
Hold on now, wait.

929
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,784
Okay.

930
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:36,790
See? Didn't hurt.

931
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,461
Well, she's going to get me
under the table here in five minutes

932
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:42,588
if she's going like this.

933
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,964
- She'll keep pouring all night.
- How...

934
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,967
Katsumi, I pour for Gruver-san now.

935
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:51,972
You excuse me? I finish cooking.

936
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:54,683
-You go ahead, darling. Go right ahead.

937
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,143
Go right ahead.

938
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:02,316
Okay-

939
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,654
Present. Whiskey.

940
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:09,114
Whiskey?

941
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,119
Okay-

942
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:17,497
All right, darling.

943
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,929
Listen, boy, she's just as cute as a bug.

944
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,264
You ain't going...
You ain't going to lose with her.

945
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:38,185
See what I mean, Ace?
I'm the happiest guy in the world.

946
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,896
Hey. You want to see the rest of the house?

947
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,857
-Yeah.
-Come on, I'll show you.

948
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:51,198
This is the garden. Katsumi,
I'm showing him around the house.

949
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,787
The bathroom is back there.

950
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,372
We got a couple of extra rooms in here.

951
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,207
- Would you like to see them?
-Yeah.

952
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,252
Well, what have you got here, boy?

953
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:06,254
Oh, Lord.

954
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:12,177
We haven't done anything with these yet,

955
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:14,096
but maybe someday, if we expand.

956
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,389
Mmm-hmm.

957
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,933
Well, listen, it's really
working out for you, isn't it, boy?

958
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,393
Everything perfect,

959
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,895
except for that rat of a colonel
I'm assigned to.

960
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,065
You wouldn't be talking about
a fellow named Crawford, would you?

961
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,234
That's the guy.
He rides every guy around here

962
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,903
that's married to a Japanese girl.
Extra duty, everything.

963
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,113
Yeah...

964
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,949
Well, he's a rough carver.
There's no getting around that.

965
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:37,744
Ah, so what do I care?
I come home to my girl and I forget it.

966
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:40,080
-Let's go.
- Wait, listen, I forgot to ask you.

967
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:43,417
Does this Hana...
This Hana-ogi speak any English?

968
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,543
Because I'm going to be...

969
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,753
Well, I don't know.
Those girls sing in a lot of languages.

970
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,755
I guess she'll be able
to catch your drift, Ace.

971
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,801
- You nasty boy, you.
- Come on. Let's...

972
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,929
Wait a minute,
I've just got to take a look at my grass, now.

973
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,806
I want to know. Are we going to be,

974
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:01,184
you know, all four of us
going to be together all evening long?

975
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:04,104
Take it easy, Ace.
You're going to blow a fuse.

976
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,273
Well, uh...

977
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:09,776
Might be.

978
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,196
- Lord, one of us is wrong here!
- Watch your head, Ace.

979
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,075
You should walk in your house, Kelly...

980
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:19,536
Katsumi, you ready?

981
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:20,871
Stoop-shouldered.

982
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:24,624
In here? You're going to have to change...

983
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,633
Hey, Kelly...

984
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,686
Hana-ogi-san.

985
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,773
This is a great day for our house.

986
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,324
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

987
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,743
Hey. Where are you going?

988
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,120
Oh, I've got to help Katsumi with the...

989
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,330
Huh?

990
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,129
Well, it looks as though everybody
just ran off and left us alone here.

991
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:17,302
It certainly was nice of you
to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.

992
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:20,847
I was just tickled to death
when they told me you were coming over.

993
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,350
Uh...

994
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,186
I'll just sit down here.

995
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,109
Well, Miss Ogi,

996
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,029
let me fix you a little drink.

997
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:38,865
No, now, well...

998
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,283
Well, okay.

999
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,208
Here's to you.

1000
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,378
Mmm!

1001
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,879
That's good.

1002
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,881
Now, don't tell me.

1003
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,050
I know you've got to slosh this
around in here a little bit

1004
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:00,178
and get the dribble off,
and give it right back to you.

1005
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,015
See, now you take that.

1006
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,145
All right.

1007
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,570
You know, I was surprised to find
that they make that stuff out of rice.

1008
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,405
We have
rice back home in America.

1009
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,990
Of course, we just...

1010
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,909
Well, we just make rice pudding out of it.
And we don't drink it.

1011
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,705
Uh, this is the first liquid rice I ever ran into.

1012
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,091
You know, did...

1013
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,178
Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,

1014
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,346
that you're a fine-looking woman?

1015
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,808
I mean, real fine.

1016
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:52,606
You're even better-looking
off the stage than you are on.

1017
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,107
That's true.

1018
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:58,069
You get up there,
and sing, dance, act, everything.

1019
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,113
You're all-around great.

1020
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,955
I wonder, where did him and Katsumi...

1021
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,541
I'm getting kind of hungry in here.

1022
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:19,049
Look, Miss Ogi, um...

1023
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,470
I'm not up too good
on Japanese ways of doing things,

1024
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,139
and maybe I'm saying the wrong thing.

1025
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:30,310
I mean, maybe
my American manners are embarrassing.

1026
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,521
But I figure, as long as you
came over here tonight,

1027
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:36,733
maybe you were interested
a little bit in meeting me, too.

1028
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,070
Now, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm wrong,

1029
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,281
then you've got to tell me.

1030
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,158
Where do we go from here?

1031
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,618
‘Cause I don't know what to say.

1032
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,662
I'm running out of things to say.

1033
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,335
My father was killed

1034
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:58,922
by American bomb dropped on my country.

1035
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:03,301
You have been my enemy.

1036
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,931
I have hated Americans.

1037
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:11,685
I have thought they are savages.

1038
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:15,855
There has been nothing
but vengeance in my heart.

1039
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,692
Miss Ogi.

1040
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:22,487
There were an awful lot
of Americans that were killed, too.

1041
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,409
And I think it would be best
if we forgot about that.

1042
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:32,289
You have been watching me at the bridge.

1043
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,125
Watching me dance,

1044
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,796
watching me as I go back to the dormitory.

1045
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,551
But I have been watching you, too,

1046
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:49,014
and you have not looked like a savage.

1047
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:54,144
And when Katsumi-san
told me how gently you'd kissed her,

1048
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,479
the day she became a bride,

1049
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,984
how tenderly you kissed
my sweet little friend,

1050
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,031
I realized the hate was of my own making.

1051
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,452
That is why I came

1052
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,330
to ask you to forgive me

1053
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:15,623
for what I have been feeling.

1054
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:20,253
Gruver-san, will you forgive me?

1055
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,053
Well, you make me feel
like an awful fool, Miss Ogi.

1056
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,475
I really feel that I ought to

1057
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,437
ask you to forgive me
for some of the things that...

1058
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,106
I've been thinking.

1059
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,945
I come from the north of Japan.

1060
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,782
And my father was a farmer,

1061
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,159
and there were nine children.

1062
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,703
And we were very poor.

1063
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,832
There are too many people
in my crowded country.

1064
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,711
I took the examination at Matsubayashi

1065
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:04,964
and now I am first dancer of all.

1066
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:09,094
When I am too old to dance,

1067
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,262
I will become head teacher.

1068
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,600
My life is planned.

1069
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,187
I am dedicated to Matsubayashi

1070
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:23,274
as you are dedicated
to American military life.

1071
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,822
I have never been in love.

1072
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:32,325
But I have dreamed

1073
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,994
and thought about it,

1074
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,497
and waited.

1075
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,503
The danger that lies ahead of us,

1076
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,755
we must face now.

1077
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:50,802
The danger of discovery for both of us,

1078
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:54,722
danger of weakness

1079
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:57,725
when it is over.

1080
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,985
I will never fall in love again.

1081
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,823
But I will love you, Ace-san,

1082
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,118
if that is your desire.

1083
01:14:57,285 --> 01:14:59,120
-Hello, how do you do?
-How do you do?

1084
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,501
Ah, Miss Webster.

1085
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,127
Oh, hello.

1086
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,131
Oh, Mr. Nakamura,
how nice of you to come.

1087
01:15:10,215 --> 01:15:11,466
It is a great pleasure.

1088
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,093
And may I say that
you look especially beautiful today?

1089
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:15,470
Thank you.

1090
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,388
I haven't been to see
this month's Kabuki program.

1091
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,099
I know. You see,
I have been waiting.

1092
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,476
Eileen.

1093
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:23,853
- Eileen.
- Oh, Mother, you remember Mr. Nakamura.

1094
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:24,979
How do you do,
Mrs. Webster?

1095
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,440
Oh, yes, of course.
Now, listen, you two,

1096
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,359
this party isn't
given especially for you.

1097
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,110
You've got to
circulate around

1098
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,404
and do more to cement
Japanese-American relations.

1099
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,741
Mother, that's exactly
what Mr. Nakamura and I are doing.

1100
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:39,118
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, Nakamura-san,

1101
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,287
my little girl
wants your autograph.

1102
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:42,622
She admires you so.

1103
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,123
Of course.

1104
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,458
Will you please
excuse me?

1105
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,918
-Yes, of course.
-Certainly.

1106
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,130
Has Lloyd come yet?

1107
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,801
Oh, Mother, how many
weeks are you going to keep on pretending?

1108
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,719
Lloyd is not coming.

1109
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:59,305
I'm absolutely furious at him.

1110
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,224
How can he ignore
the General's invitation?

1111
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,560
I had it delivered
personally to his office.

1112
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,895
I'm stuck with that
Farrington woman. Can you help me out?

1113
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:11,317
Uh-oh. There's Crawford.

1114
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:13,611
Whenever he shows up,
there's always something.

1115
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,406
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute, General?

1116
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,740
Certainly, Colonel.

1117
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:20,243
- Major, do you have that list of the...
-Yes, ma'am.

1118
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,204
I want to see if
the Williams have come yet...

1119
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:24,414
Yes, they have.

1120
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,750
Oh, waiter.

1121
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,924
The reason I took
this up with you personally, General,

1122
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:37,552
is because
it concerns Major Gruver.

1123
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,013
Now, we think
he's hooked on to a Japanese dame.

1124
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,347
Shh! Colonel!

1125
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:44,017
Well, I'm sorry, General,
but this thing's gotten me all riled up.

1126
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,560
Do you realize what it will mean

1127
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,186
to the enlisted men in this area

1128
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,398
if they find out that their big hero,
Ace Gruver, is out with some...

1129
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,359
I've known
Major Gruver all his life.

1130
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:56,446
I'm a close friend of his father's.
I assure you must be wrong.

1131
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,573
He was seen going
into that house.

1132
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,868
Now, my men have been
watching a troublemaker named Kelly.

1133
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,037
He shacked up with
another native girl...

1134
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,413
"Shacked up," Colonel?

1135
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:08,625
Kelly's married to a Japanese girl.
Major Gruver was the best man.

1136
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,044
Seems quite natural
to me that he'd visit them.

1137
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,087
All right.
How am I going to handle the situation?

1138
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:16,341
Well, don't handle it.
I trust Major Gruver implicitly.

1139
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,261
Well, General, is it all right with you
if I post an order

1140
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:23,056
to keep these
officers from being seen

1141
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,391
with indigenous personnel?

1142
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:28,478
Then if they are seen,
there's something we can do about it.

1143
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,812
All right.
All right.

1144
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:54,545
Lloyd.

1145
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,353
Look at you, Hana.

1146
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:18,611
No one saw you come?

1147
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:22,865
No, there's no military
personnel around here,

1148
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:24,283
except me.

1149
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,121
We must go to the tea ceremony.

1150
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,580
Yeah, I know.

1151
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,748
I know.

1152
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,209
Good afternoon.

1153
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,801
This getting up
and down likely to kill me.

1154
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:17,628
You make such
a production of everything.

1155
01:19:20,298 --> 01:19:23,259
The pleasure does not
lie in the end itself.

1156
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,637
It's the pleasure of
all steps to that end.

1157
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:27,889
Oh, I see.

1158
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:58,336
That you, Ace?

1159
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,587
Yeah, Kelly.

1160
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:01,839
Come on in here.

1161
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,300
I can't right now.

1162
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,554
He'd be surprised
you come in this way.

1163
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,223
He'd faint.

1164
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,351
Just a little
lower, little lower, Katsumi.

1165
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,394
- You always seem to be a little above it.
-Oh?

1166
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:16,521
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1167
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,605
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1168
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,118
Kelly-san, now you get in tub?

1169
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:32,662
Okay, all right.

1170
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,457
Is Hana-ogi
coming over tonight?

1171
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,876
Yeah, if she can get away.

1172
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:41,629
We're going to cook up
some fine Saint Louis goulash

1173
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,589
with a little Memphis
greens in there.

1174
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:50,638
What are you doing
tonight after dinner

1175
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,807
when Hana-ogi goes
back to the theater?

1176
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:54,851
Nothing.

1177
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,478
How about playing poker
with Katsumi and me?

1178
01:20:57,562 --> 01:21:00,356
Oh, I'll be delighted
to take your money and your pants.

1179
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,445
This is the life,
ain't it, Ace?

1180
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:46,193
There you are.

1181
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:53,534
How do you do?

1182
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,674
Listen, I got
one word for you.

1183
01:22:09,467 --> 01:22:10,801
What is that?

1184
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,553
- Food.
-Oh.

1185
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:28,945
Sayonara

1186
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:33,908
Japanese goodbye

1187
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:39,121
Whisper sayonara

1188
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:43,292
Lover, don't you cry

1189
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:49,423
No more we stop to see

1190
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:53,427
Pretty cherry blossom

1191
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,308
No more we beneath the tree

1192
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:03,270
Looking at the sky

1193
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:09,068
Sayonara

1194
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:14,407
Sayonara

1195
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:19,996
Goodbye

1196
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:26,127
That's the cutest
thing I ever saw, honey.

1197
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,586
I must go.

1198
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:32,508
Good eating.

1199
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:35,720
Bye-bye.

1200
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,097
Are you going back
to the officer's quarters tonight?

1201
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:42,184
No, I think I'm going
to just fool around here.

1202
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,270
What will you
do all evening?

1203
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,023
What am I going to do?
I'm going to get some beer,

1204
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:48,649
some pretzels,
and some girls up here.

1205
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:50,401
I'm going to have
a little fun for a change.

1206
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,486
Good.

1207
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,447
I don't like
you to be lonely.

1208
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:01,579
Take care.

1209
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:27,897
Come on in, Katsumi.

1210
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:35,654
I'm sorry,
Lloyd, I had to come. It's important.

1211
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:37,948
Hello, Eileen.

1212
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,661
How are you?

1213
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:45,706
Listen, sit down,
will you?

1214
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,543
Take this stuff
out of there, just getting a little...

1215
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:01,138
Go on, sit down here.

1216
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,852
How are you?

1217
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,279
They're after you, Lloyd.

1218
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:18,823
Who's after me?

1219
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:22,868
There's a colonel.
His name's Crawford.

1220
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:25,496
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1221
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,374
I know him.

1222
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,585
He's the one that's riding Kelly.
This is Kelly's house.

1223
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,380
Yes. Yes, I know.

1224
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:38,384
You want to hear this,
don't you, Lloyd?

1225
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,095
Yeah. Sure, I want to.
Of course I do.

1226
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:43,681
I overheard
Colonel Crawford say

1227
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,975
that he's been having
this house watched,

1228
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:51,564
hoping to catch Kelly
at something irregular, I suppose.

1229
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,942
Anyhow, that's how
I knew where it was.

1230
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:58,070
Well, then they...

1231
01:25:59,113 --> 01:26:01,282
They seen me coming
in and out of here.

1232
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:02,616
Yes.

1233
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,247
I just felt that
I had to tell you.

1234
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,087
Eileen, uh...

1235
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:19,592
There's something that I feel that...

1236
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:21,010
I must go, Lloyd.

1237
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:25,306
I just wanted to warn
you to be particularly careful about...

1238
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,268
About what, honey?

1239
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,566
About sticking strictly
to military regulations.

1240
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:40,779
Oh, Lloyd, they'll do
anything to hang something on you, to...

1241
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:42,615
To keep you in line.

1242
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:48,162
After all, you're
the Air Force's pinup boy, you know.

1243
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:54,668
Colonel Crawford sounded
as if he was after blood.

1244
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,967
You know, more than
anything else I could think of, I...

1245
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:04,678
I must
go now, Lloyd. Good luck.

1246
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,141
Wait a minute,
let me help you off...

1247
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:13,812
Eileen, I know...

1248
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,189
Lloyd.

1249
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,690
Lloyd, you've really
thought seriously

1250
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:18,192
about what you're
doing, haven't you?

1251
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:24,615
Oh, yes.

1252
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,159
I think I have.

1253
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,536
Oh, I hope so.

1254
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,624
You have a brilliant
record in the Air Force.

1255
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:36,377
More people depend
upon you than you'll ever know.

1256
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:40,839
Before you throw all that
you've worked for away, Lloyd, be sure.

1257
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,508
Please, be sure.

1258
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:50,432
Eileen, l don’t think
if I had a million years,

1259
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,351
I could tell you
how all this happened.

1260
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:58,357
I'd better go before
I lose all my charm.

1261
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:31,056
Do you like this old,
curious play?

1262
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,935
Yeah, I'm beginning
to get a kick out of it.

1263
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,153
See the rope
between the rocks?

1264
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,738
Yeah.

1265
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,907
That is a Shinto sign
showing they are married.

1266
01:28:49,325 --> 01:28:50,659
What, the rocks?

1267
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:53,287
Yes.
They've been together so long,

1268
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,706
our people thought
it was time they should get married.

1269
01:28:56,457 --> 01:28:58,459
They look well
together, don't you think?

1270
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,086
Yeah, they make
a handsome-looking couple.

1271
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,672
Do you like my country?

1272
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:06,258
Yeah. Was all these...
All these funny things here before

1273
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,801
when I came to Japan?

1274
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:09,094
Yes.

1275
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:20,939
Well, hello.

1276
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:23,108
Hello there, Double Ugly.
How are you?

1277
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,235
To what do we
owe the honor of this visit?

1278
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:30,115
Laundry. Gonna put down
the dirties and pick up the cleans.

1279
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,413
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1280
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,540
This came in
the office this morning.

1281
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:39,708
Thought you might
like to see it.

1282
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,712
"This is a routine reminder
of the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe."

1283
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:47,174
Quote, "Any public display,
whatever, of affection

1284
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,761
"for a Japanese national
by a member of this command is forbidden.

1285
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:53,639
"Officers should not even
appear on public streets

1286
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:57,142
"accompanied by indigenous
female personnel." Unquote.

1287
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:58,352
Hooray for Christmas.

1288
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:01,188
Come on, Ace, this is
serious. Everybody got one of these things.

1289
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:05,275
Oh, listen, fool, Hana-ogi and I are
just as careful as we can be.

1290
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:08,737
We never go anyplace where we're gonna be
seen by anybody that matters.

1291
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,657
We don't even walk
down the same street.

1292
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,993
We just go out
in the country and fool around.

1293
01:30:16,203 --> 01:30:18,580
See, listen, you never been to the
country around here, have you?

1294
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,918
Awful pretty country around here.
I mean it.

1295
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,504
You know what
I saw yesterday?

1296
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,173
I saw two rocks
that just got married.

1297
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,633
You what?

1298
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:31,844
I saw two rocks
that got married.

1299
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,679
And they looked very
happy together, too.

1300
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,347
Oh, I'll bet they did.

1301
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:36,807
Oh, they did.

1302
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,811
If you gonna be smart,
I'll tell you what you do.

1303
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:43,730
You get your little shoes shined,
you go out tonight,

1304
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,316
'cause tonight is
gonna be Tanabata.

1305
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:49,695
Okay, what's Tanabata?

1306
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,990
You mean you're gonna
sit there with your bare face hanging out

1307
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,700
and tell me
you don't know what Tanabata is?

1308
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:55,784
Yeah.

1309
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:58,162
Well, my word, boy.

1310
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:01,206
I'm ashamed of you. I thought
everybody knew what Tanabata was.

1311
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:04,209
Tanabata is
the night of love.

1312
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:06,879
You told me
all about it one time.

1313
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,964
You were telling me
about Harry Truman

1314
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,300
and New York Yankees
and sex

1315
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:14,928
and New York Yankees
and Harry Truman and sex.

1316
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,555
And I'll see you...

1317
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,059
Sex!

1318
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:37,534
What have I done
to deserve such happiness?

1319
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,914
I have seen this night of
Tanabata come and go many times,

1320
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:47,794
but never before
have I understood what it meant.

1321
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,797
Tanabata.

1322
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:55,135
Oh, my heart is so
full of love for you.

1323
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:40,973
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?

1324
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,517
Nakamura-san gets your note.

1325
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,851
Here is reply.

1326
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:45,936
Thank you.

1327
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:49,523
He wishes if you will have
dinner with him and his guests.

1328
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,108
Thank you very much.

1329
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:26,268
They have a rather
pleasant garden here, Miss Webster.

1330
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,187
Would you like to see it?

1331
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,565
Yes, I think I would.

1332
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:57,716
How beautiful.

1333
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,895
What are you
really afraid of, Miss Webster?

1334
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,439
You don't think
it would enter Major Gruver's mind

1335
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:15,567
to marry a Japanese girl?

1336
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:18,904
I don't know.

1337
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,199
Then permit me
to reassure you.

1338
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:24,701
I think Major Gruver
is brave

1339
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:28,121
but not brave enough
to face the censure

1340
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:30,749
that would result
from such a marriage.

1341
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:34,586
As for our famous,
honored Hana-ogi,

1342
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,631
there are many Japanese,

1343
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:39,091
most of them, in fact,

1344
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:43,303
who look upon marriage
to an occidental with as much distaste

1345
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:46,306
as your people do
to one of us.

1346
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,601
I do not feel that way.

1347
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,728
But, then,
I have had the privilege

1348
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,647
of traveling
in your country

1349
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,566
and knowing some
great people there.

1350
01:34:57,442 --> 01:35:01,738
And I am especially
conscious at this moment

1351
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,701
that beauty
is not confined to any one race.

1352
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,416
Do not turn away,
Miss Webster.

1353
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:17,879
I am not necessarily
making love to you.

1354
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,051
I am only stating a very

1355
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:26,221
obvious fact.

1356
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:30,642
May I see you again,
Miss Webster,

1357
01:35:31,268 --> 01:35:34,813
and acquaint you
with more Japan?

1358
01:35:36,148 --> 01:35:37,524
Of course.

1359
01:35:37,983 --> 01:35:40,110
I need to know more,
much more,

1360
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:42,821
about everything.

1361
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:05,510
There she is.

1362
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,139
Hello, honey.

1363
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,111
Are you tired?

1364
01:36:25,906 --> 01:36:29,493
No, TIM...
TIM been lying here

1365
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,369
thinking about myself.

1366
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:34,164
You know,
I can't believe I'm really here.

1367
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:37,626
It's hard to believe that...

1368
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:41,213
You know, it's hard
to believe me being the same Lloyd Gruver

1369
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:44,049
that came over from Korea
just a little bit ago.

1370
01:36:47,177 --> 01:36:48,637
You know, I been thinking

1371
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,889
that all my life

1372
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:53,141
I been so busy

1373
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:57,312
snapping to,
and giving orders, and taking orders,

1374
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:00,732
and being a general’s son,
and doing the job

1375
01:37:02,234 --> 01:37:06,071
and all that,
I just never took time to sit right down

1376
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:12,077
and, you know, think about
what my reason for living is.

1377
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,999
And I been spending
some afternoons here just

1378
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:20,919
being peaceful

1379
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:24,047
and easy and thinking.

1380
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,927
And I believe
for the first time,

1381
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:35,350
I'm just beginning
to understand

1382
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:37,185
what it's all about,

1383
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:41,106
what I really am,
what I really want.

1384
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:44,234
It's a nice feeling.

1385
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:55,453
Yeah, come on in.

1386
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:59,332
Ace, excuse me.
I hate to bother you.

1387
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,126
TIM got the news.

1388
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:02,627
You got what news?

1389
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:04,212
I'm getting shipped back.

1390
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:07,007
You being shipped
back where?

1391
01:38:07,424 --> 01:38:08,758
Stateside.

1392
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:10,969
I've been reassigned
to a new duty station.

1393
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:14,306
Well...

1394
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,517
Did you tell Katsumi yet?

1395
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:18,727
No.

1396
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:21,354
All right. Well, don't tell her, because
maybe we can work something out.

1397
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,316
What reason did
he give you for it?

1398
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,736
No reason.
I know what it is.

1399
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,698
Every guy on that list
is married to a Japanese girl.

1400
01:38:36,912 --> 01:38:39,831
I'm sorry, Major.
There's nothing you can do.

1401
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:46,630
We're sending Kelly
to the States Thursday, and that's that.

1402
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:51,217
Well, what about
his wife, Colonel?

1403
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:53,637
Well, she stays here.

1404
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,849
He knew he couldn't take her back with
him when he married her.

1405
01:38:57,891 --> 01:38:58,892
Mmm-hmm.

1406
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,518
Didn't you?

1407
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:01,811
That's right.

1408
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:05,607
Well, you'd be busting up
his home then, you know.

1409
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:07,776
I'm not busting up anything.

1410
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:14,407
Oh, I admit Kelly's
been a pain in my side for quite a while now.

1411
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:15,951
Well, could you tell me

1412
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:19,120
why he didn't have
the privilege of extending his tour of duty?

1413
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:20,705
Don't ask me, Major.

1414
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:23,667
There are lots of reasons
for these things.

1415
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:27,337
Anyway, it is an order.

1416
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,547
And there's nothing
you can do about it

1417
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,717
even if you are
a four-star general’s son.

1418
01:39:34,678 --> 01:39:35,887
Yeah, well...

1419
01:39:38,974 --> 01:39:42,227
Would it make any difference
if I told you my wife's going to have a baby?

1420
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:47,691
Well, that's tough,
I admit.

1421
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:51,987
Colonel, under these circumstances,

1422
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:54,239
don't you think
that you'd be able to

1423
01:39:55,073 --> 01:39:57,242
postpone this
for a little while?

1424
01:39:58,076 --> 01:40:00,161
Maybe I could be
transferred back to Korea.

1425
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,164
No, you're going home.

1426
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:08,294
All the boys
on this list, going home.

1427
01:40:10,255 --> 01:40:11,256
Where is your home?

1428
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:13,842
That house by the canal.

1429
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,344
I mean your real home.

1430
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,263
That house by the canal.

1431
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,931
Yeah, all right.

1432
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:25,729
I've taken all the insubordination
from you I intend to.

1433
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,107
Now, you listen
to me, wise guy,

1434
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:33,945
that house by the canal
is off-limits from now on.

1435
01:40:35,739 --> 01:40:37,699
Whole street's off-limits.

1436
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:39,826
You want a court-martial?

1437
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:42,996
That mean I could
stay in Japan?

1438
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,122
Come on, Kel.

1439
01:40:44,164 --> 01:40:45,540
You're shipping out
of here on Thursday.

1440
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,167
And don't you
try to help him.

1441
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,464
You remember that
house by the canal

1442
01:40:53,048 --> 01:40:55,300
is off-limits to all personnel.

1443
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:59,220
Would you tell me,
Colonel, just exactly

1444
01:40:59,304 --> 01:41:01,473
what you mean
by that last remark?

1445
01:41:01,848 --> 01:41:04,142
Well, that's all
I'm prepared to say at the minute,

1446
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:06,394
except you watch your step.

1447
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,612
So, I don't know
what else to say to you, General.

1448
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,155
I've known this boy
a long time,

1449
01:41:17,197 --> 01:41:20,075
and if he has to go back without
Katsumi, he's gonna be in trouble.

1450
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,701
And...

1451
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:24,329
Well, I mean,
that's about it. That's it.

1452
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:26,247
What about his wife?

1453
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:28,875
-I don't know.
- And the baby?

1454
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:34,089
So it comes down to
the fact that the Army lets them get married

1455
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:36,007
and then forces
them to desert their wives and babies.

1456
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:38,510
That's not fair, Eileen.

1457
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,847
A boy away from home
for the first time, lonesome,

1458
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:45,517
often falls in love
with the first girl he touches.

1459
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,685
In most cases,
with a girl from the streets.

1460
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:50,647
It's up to the service
in some measure

1461
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:52,899
to be fathers
and mothers to these boys

1462
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:57,695
and try to head off
these marriages.

1463
01:41:58,113 --> 01:42:00,615
But after they're married
why should they be sent home?

1464
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:03,493
The man's being transferred
to a new duty station, Eileen,

1465
01:42:03,535 --> 01:42:04,702
along with many others.

1466
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,372
Now, don't ask me
the reasons for changes of duty.

1467
01:42:07,831 --> 01:42:09,374
There are thousands of them.

1468
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,876
But Lloyd said
that most of the men on this particular list

1469
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:13,545
are married to Japanese girls.

1470
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,213
That can't be just
a coincidence, Father.

1471
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,548
Why not?
It could easily be.

1472
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,716
There have been
lots of marriages.

1473
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,010
Frankly, with some
of these men,

1474
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:24,055
I think they might
welcome the transfer.

1475
01:42:24,514 --> 01:42:25,849
Why is that, sir?

1476
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:30,019
There have been unfortunate
aftermaths to many of these marriages.

1477
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,063
Recriminations, regrets.

1478
01:42:33,857 --> 01:42:36,234
A boy gets married
impulsively, then feels caught,

1479
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:38,611
doesn't know how to get out of
it, doesn't know what to do.

1480
01:42:38,695 --> 01:42:41,239
Change of duty
gives them both a chance to think it over.

1481
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:42,490
To cool off.

1482
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,785
Now, I don't mean to
imply that that's the reason

1483
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:48,037
these men are being
transferred, but...

1484
01:42:48,413 --> 01:42:49,747
Well...

1485
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,001
The whole thing's

1486
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,336
a messy business.

1487
01:42:56,963 --> 01:43:00,592
General Webster, there is no regret in the
case of Kelly and Katsumi.

1488
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:03,595
You can have
my word on that.

1489
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:05,013
Lloyd,

1490
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:08,099
three officers
came to me today

1491
01:43:08,183 --> 01:43:10,226
with identical requests
for their men.

1492
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:12,520
It's not our policy
to interfere with decisions

1493
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,856
made by immediate
commanding officers.

1494
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:17,567
The basic structure
of the whole military service would collapse

1495
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:19,527
if we started doing
things like that.

1496
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,198
Your father would
understand that, even if you don't.

1497
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,118
Are you going to
ask me to make an exception of Kelly

1498
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,786
when I've refused
these other men?

1499
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:34,459
I am going to ask you
to do that, sir.

1500
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:39,255
You made an exception of me
when you brought me from Korea.

1501
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,261
I'm afraid
it's a hopeless situation, Lloyd.

1502
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:51,726
Well...

1503
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:55,939
That's the end of Joe Kelly.

1504
01:43:57,523 --> 01:44:00,693
You told me yourself
that Kelly's past record was against him.

1505
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:02,570
I couldn't even use that,
don't you see?

1506
01:44:02,654 --> 01:44:05,114
Why does this mean
so much to you, Lloyd?

1507
01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:11,537
Kelly's from my outfit, Mrs. Webster.
I was his best man.

1508
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:14,916
And I'm planning to marry
a Japanese girl myself.

1509
01:44:19,754 --> 01:44:21,839
Come into the other room, Eileen.

1510
01:44:21,923 --> 01:44:24,050
This is something
for your father to handle.

1511
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:28,513
No, Mrs. Webster, I don't think it's
anything for anybody to handle.

1512
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:36,437
I'm sorry, Eileen.

1513
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:42,986
Mrs. Webster.

1514
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:45,113
Good afternoon, y'all.

1515
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:55,373
I don't think I'll ever love anyone
again as much as I love Lloyd.

1516
01:44:56,749 --> 01:44:58,876
But I'll tell you something
that's rather ironic.

1517
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:03,673
I once asked Lloyd
if he ever felt like grabbing me

1518
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,426
and hauling me off
to a shack somewhere.

1519
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:10,138
That's just what
he's done, isn't it?

1520
01:45:10,972 --> 01:45:12,390
Only it's with somebody else.

1521
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,560
Don't go out, Eileen.

1522
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:16,769
Stay and talk.

1523
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:18,229
I'm sorry, Mother.

1524
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:20,732
There's only one person
I'd like to talk to at the moment,

1525
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:23,401
and oddly enough,
he's Japanese.

1526
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:29,907
Ace, I've been
waiting for you.

1527
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:31,409
Hey, Kelly, listen.

1528
01:45:31,868 --> 01:45:34,954
I just came from
General Webster's house

1529
01:45:35,038 --> 01:45:36,581
and there's a whole
big mess there.

1530
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:37,915
-No good, huh?
- No.

1531
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:40,918
He didn't...
He didn't go for it.

1532
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:44,422
Matter of fact,
I think I even messed it up a little.

1533
01:45:46,132 --> 01:45:47,633
That figures.

1534
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:50,011
Did you tell
Katsumi yet?

1535
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:51,137
No.

1536
01:45:51,929 --> 01:45:53,639
I'm chickening out fast.

1537
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:57,727
Besides, she's got her heart set on
something she planned for us tonight.

1538
01:45:58,186 --> 01:45:59,896
Wants us both to take
the train to Osaka

1539
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:02,106
and meet the girls
at the puppet show.

1540
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:05,068
Why Spoil it?

1541
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:09,989
Maybe I'll tell
her late tonight when we're alone.

1542
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:16,162
Kelly, don't give up on it.
I think there's gonna be a way out of it.

1543
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:17,246
- There's got to be.
- You think so?

1544
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,664
- Yes, I do.
-I don't.

1545
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,460
- I'll see you, Ace.
- Hi, hon.

1546
01:46:22,502 --> 01:46:23,503
Kelly-san.

1547
01:46:25,088 --> 01:46:27,423
Hey, tell Katsumi
we'll be there with bells.

1548
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:30,635
Were you able to help?

1549
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:35,890
No. I wasn't.

1550
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:37,475
How terrible.

1551
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,980
I know this is hard, honey.

1552
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,316
It's hard,
but it's not gonna last long.

1553
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:49,112
I mean, the Army's got to change that
law next year or the next one.

1554
01:46:50,113 --> 01:46:53,116
I mean, it just has to be.
I'm sure of it.

1555
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:57,161
And, as a matter of fact,

1556
01:46:57,203 --> 01:46:59,956
I'm so sure of it
that I went downtown today

1557
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:02,667
and I signed
some papers here

1558
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:05,044
that mean that you and I
are gonna get married.

1559
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:09,298
What's the matter?

1560
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,008
We never spoke of marriage.

1561
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,970
I know we didn't, darling.

1562
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:19,267
I know we didn't.
I been going round and round with that

1563
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,352
every day for a long time.

1564
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:25,565
And I didn't feel I could
speak about it until now.

1565
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,359
Now I can.

1566
01:47:30,278 --> 01:47:33,739
Now, of course,
I won't be able to take you back to America,

1567
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:36,534
but they're bound to change
that ridiculous law soon.

1568
01:47:37,994 --> 01:47:40,538
And until then,
I'm gonna stay here with you.

1569
01:47:42,874 --> 01:47:45,960
I'm not stuck in the Air Force.
I can resign.

1570
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:49,213
Of course,
I'm not trained to do anything else,

1571
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:51,174
but I'd find something.

1572
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:54,844
We never spoke of marriage.

1573
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:59,891
I know we didn't, darling,
but we're speaking of it now.

1574
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:10,359
Do you remember
the first night we talked?

1575
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:14,947
I said there would
be danger of weakness when it is over.

1576
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:20,661
Over?
What are you talking about?

1577
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:27,460
I am tempted.
With you, I could become a woman.

1578
01:48:28,419 --> 01:48:31,881
And a mother.
And I could love you.

1579
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,510
That's right.

1580
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:38,721
Do you think I haven't
thought about it?

1581
01:48:39,222 --> 01:48:42,266
Do you think
I want to become a lonely old woman

1582
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:45,937
who teaches dancing,
now that I have known you?

1583
01:48:48,356 --> 01:48:50,024
But it is no good.

1584
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,485
You must know it, too.

1585
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:56,322
No, no. I don't know
anything of the kind.

1586
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:00,660
The way you talk about
leaving the Air Force,

1587
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:04,372
finding some pitiful
way of earning living

1588
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,999
just to be here with
your Japanese wife.

1589
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,335
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1590
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:15,841
I think we're too far
in this thing to be talking like that.

1591
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,471
Matsubayashi has been
kind to me, Lloyd.

1592
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:23,975
I am obligated to them.

1593
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:28,145
No, you ain't.
You... No, no. You obligated to me.

1594
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:31,315
They are my life.

1595
01:49:31,941 --> 01:49:34,819
I will bring shame
to them, disgrace.

1596
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,989
Lloyd, you know
what I mean?

1597
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:41,659
Yeah, I think
I'm beginning to know what you mean.

1598
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:45,580
I think you mean you simply don't love me
enough to go on through with it.

1599
01:49:45,663 --> 01:49:47,873
That's what you mean,
don't you?

1600
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:50,376
Why don't you
just come on out and say it?

1601
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:52,336
It is not what I mean.

1602
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:59,677
I'm leaving for Tokyo
in six days.

1603
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:03,014
Matsubayashi are sending me.

1604
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:04,807
You What?

1605
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:11,147
With another troupe.
They have found out about us.

1606
01:50:12,356 --> 01:50:16,402
Any other girl, they would have
dismissed, but because they like me,

1607
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:20,823
because they feel I am important
to them, they are being lenient.

1608
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,660
Well, I'm not gonna be
lenient with you.

1609
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,912
I want you to
tell me right now

1610
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:29,874
why Matsubayashi
means more to you than I do?

1611
01:50:32,877 --> 01:50:35,838
Lloyd, there is something
about myself

1612
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,381
I have not told you.

1613
01:50:38,799 --> 01:50:41,135
I have no right
to marry anyone.

1614
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:44,221
My father was very poor.

1615
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:48,059
To save his other children,

1616
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,686
he was forced to sell
one of his daughters.

1617
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:55,566
The man from the houses
of Yoshiwara came to him.

1618
01:50:57,193 --> 01:50:59,278
Because I was the oldest,

1619
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:02,907
he agreed I should
go with them.

1620
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:07,078
Your father sold you?

1621
01:51:08,245 --> 01:51:12,166
Yes, but I was saved
from starting this life

1622
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,960
by my best friend,
Fumiko-san.

1623
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:20,091
Her father paid
money to free me

1624
01:51:21,676 --> 01:51:24,178
and she brought me
to Matsubayashi.

1625
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:30,601
There, I not only
earn my living,

1626
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:34,605
I brought honor
back to my family.

1627
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:39,735
Matsubayashi has
been kind to me.

1628
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,363
They have trusted me.

1629
01:51:43,948 --> 01:51:45,616
I cannot leave them.

1630
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:48,619
I cannot marry anyone.

1631
01:51:52,748 --> 01:51:54,875
Don't you understand?

1632
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:02,883
I don't know.

1633
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:06,095
I don't know
what to think.

1634
01:52:09,515 --> 01:52:10,599
I'll kill you!

1635
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:12,101
You ever do
anything like this,

1636
01:52:12,143 --> 01:52:13,519
and I'll kill you,
you understand?

1637
01:52:13,602 --> 01:52:15,688
Get that straight, now!
I'll kill you!

1638
01:52:15,771 --> 01:52:17,940
Wait a minute. Listen.
Just take it easy, now.

1639
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:19,400
Ace, look at this.

1640
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:23,904
-It fell out of her bag.
- What is it?

1641
01:52:23,988 --> 01:52:25,823
She was gonna
have it done, too.

1642
01:52:25,865 --> 01:52:28,409
Tomorrow,
by that quack doctor down by the docks.

1643
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:30,703
- What?
-For 8 bucks, she slashes her eyelids

1644
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:32,913
and sews them
back up again.

1645
01:52:32,997 --> 01:52:35,124
Lots of these stupid little jerks
have it done.

1646
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:36,751
She was gonna surprise me.

1647
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:38,461
Well...

1648
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:39,670
Then...

1649
01:52:39,754 --> 01:52:43,632
Then I have good eyes.
I fool everybody.

1650
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:46,886
I look American, like Joe.

1651
01:52:48,012 --> 01:52:53,142
Hana-ogi, will you tell
that stupid dame I love her the way she is?

1652
01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:55,144
I don't want her changed.

1653
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:57,021
Will you tell her
I love her mouth

1654
01:52:57,062 --> 01:53:00,316
and her nose
and her ears and her eyes

1655
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:02,109
just the way they are?

1656
01:53:02,193 --> 01:53:05,446
Tell her if she ever does
anything like that, I'll...

1657
01:53:06,197 --> 01:53:07,490
Wait a minute.
Calm down, Kelly.

1658
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:09,950
I want him
be proud of me.

1659
01:53:10,034 --> 01:53:11,202
Listen, listen. Listen.

1660
01:53:11,452 --> 01:53:13,078
I am sorry.

1661
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:16,207
Listen, if you want him
to be proud of you, you got to quit this stuff.

1662
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,708
‘Cause you want to be
a good wife, don't you?

1663
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:19,877
You're making him
very unhappy when you're doing that.

1664
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,213
Now, tell him you're sorry
and you're not going to do it anymore.

1665
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:23,547
Tell him that.

1666
01:53:23,631 --> 01:53:24,632
Joe...

1667
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:28,719
I so sorry.

1668
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:34,225
Okay. Now, we're gonna
forget about that, all right?

1669
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,477
Now, listen.
I came over here tonight,

1670
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,187
I thought we were gonna
have a fish fry.

1671
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:40,439
We were gonna have some fun right
here, and dancing and yelling,

1672
01:53:40,523 --> 01:53:41,816
and what do I find?

1673
01:53:41,899 --> 01:53:43,400
What's gonna happen to us?

1674
01:53:43,484 --> 01:53:44,527
Puppet show.

1675
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:46,487
-Yeah, we had a surprise...
- You like?

1676
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,280
Sure, I do.
Been looking forward to it.

1677
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:51,242
I know everybody tonight.

1678
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:52,535
Yeah.

1679
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:56,580
And

1680
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,415
we will be late.

1681
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:07,550
Look.

1682
01:54:08,259 --> 01:54:12,930
The lover is leaving the city,
walk to the wood.

1683
01:54:50,551 --> 01:54:54,221
Lloyd, don't think
of anything now.

1684
01:54:55,431 --> 01:54:56,974
Watch the play.

1685
01:54:57,808 --> 01:54:59,602
It's a tender story.

1686
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:11,864
When gong sound,
it is done.

1687
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:17,119
And then she will
bind her body.

1688
01:55:18,704 --> 01:55:20,122
Bind her body?

1689
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:23,459
So that she will not fall
in an ugly position

1690
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,669
of dishonor when she dies.

1691
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:27,171
- When she dies?
- Mmm.

1692
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:28,589
Yes, shinju.

1693
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,692
It is custom for lovers

1694
01:55:48,776 --> 01:55:52,112
to die together
when they can no longer face life.

1695
01:56:02,998 --> 01:56:05,125
It is so beautiful.

1696
01:56:06,043 --> 01:56:08,879
Beautiful?
They're gonna die, aren't they?

1697
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:13,968
They will live
in another world on a beautiful lake

1698
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,887
floating always together

1699
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,390
like water lily.

1700
01:56:22,601 --> 01:56:23,727
Sure.

1701
01:57:45,851 --> 01:57:48,896
Kelly-san! Kelly-san!
Kelly-san!

1702
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:01,658
Something about soldiers
going through the house.

1703
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:08,707
That's the MPs, boy.

1704
01:58:08,791 --> 01:58:10,542
-What happened? What's wrong?
- Come here, come here.

1705
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:12,211
- What happened?
- Get in the car.

1706
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,256
Go to Matsubayashi.

1707
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,175
- Please, please tell me. I will not leave.
- I will, I will.

1708
01:58:18,217 --> 01:58:19,676
Now, get in the car.
I'll tell you later.

1709
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,261
Matsubayashi.

1710
01:58:24,014 --> 01:58:25,265
Hey, Ed, look.

1711
01:58:41,532 --> 01:58:42,658
Look at that.

1712
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:47,371
You're Major Gruver,
aren't you?

1713
01:58:48,163 --> 01:58:49,206
That's right.

1714
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:50,791
Sorry, Major, you'll have
to come with us.

1715
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,042
General Webster's orders.

1716
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:54,378
So, what right do
you have to board up this man's house?

1717
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:55,921
He won't be needing
it anymore, Major.

1718
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:57,089
He's shipping out Thursday.

1719
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:58,215
Joe?

1720
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,551
Come on, Major.

1721
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,304
You'll hear from me, Kelly.

1722
01:59:18,777 --> 01:59:20,362
Come on, kid.

1723
01:59:20,404 --> 01:59:24,158
We'll get in through the garden.
I got something to tell you.

1724
01:59:47,389 --> 01:59:48,932
You were seen
in public with her tonight,

1725
01:59:48,974 --> 01:59:51,101
violating the orders
of the area.

1726
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:53,353
This has given
me the right to put you under arrest.

1727
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:57,065
And, for your own sake,
I think I'd better do it.

1728
01:59:58,233 --> 01:59:59,234
Well,

1729
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:01,236
you have anything to say?

1730
02:00:03,739 --> 02:00:06,867
Well, just as soon I'm out of this,
I'm going to be married,

1731
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:08,368
and have a house of my own.

1732
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:12,414
I'm afraid not.

1733
02:00:12,873 --> 02:00:15,167
I'm sorry, Lloyd,
but it's all settled.

1734
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,670
The supervisor of the Matsubayashi
came to see me tonight.

1735
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:21,757
The girl goes
to Tokyo, and you fly to Randolph Field,

1736
02:00:22,299 --> 02:00:23,383
day after tomorrow.

1737
02:00:24,301 --> 02:00:25,844
Here are your orders.

1738
02:00:27,221 --> 02:00:29,348
Until that time,
you're under house arrest.

1739
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:34,686
You're not to leave
your quarters until further notice.

1740
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:43,320
I'm doing this because I feel you're not
responsible at the moment, Lloyd.

1741
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:45,822
After all, I've known
your father for years.

1742
02:00:52,037 --> 02:00:53,664
Well, that's all.

1743
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:30,450
Mike...

1744
02:01:31,576 --> 02:01:32,703
Did you see her?

1745
02:01:32,786 --> 02:01:34,162
No, Ace. I couldn't even get
near the place.

1746
02:01:34,204 --> 02:01:35,247
They've really clamped down.

1747
02:01:35,330 --> 02:01:37,541
I went to the stage
door and I couldn't even see Fumiko-san.

1748
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:40,294
Well, listen, I've got to see her.
I'm being shipped out of here tomorrow.

1749
02:01:40,669 --> 02:01:42,087
Major Gruver?

1750
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,297
What is it?

1751
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:44,548
Would you do
something for us?

1752
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:45,841
What do you want?

1753
02:01:46,633 --> 02:01:48,218
Airman Kelly's disappeared.

1754
02:01:48,302 --> 02:01:51,305
No, that's impossible.
I was with him just last night.

1755
02:01:51,388 --> 02:01:52,431
We know.

1756
02:01:52,514 --> 02:01:53,974
He was scheduled to fly out
in a couple days.

1757
02:01:54,057 --> 02:01:57,602
But a special plane came through, and
Colonel Crawford told us to get him on it.

1758
02:01:57,686 --> 02:02:00,105
I took him to
the airport at 12:50.

1759
02:02:00,188 --> 02:02:03,025
When the plane took off,
Kelly wasn't on it.

1760
02:02:03,066 --> 02:02:04,401
Figured you might
know where he is.

1761
02:02:04,443 --> 02:02:07,821
How should I know where he is?
His house has been boarded up, hasn't it?

1762
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,741
We know.
Neighbors won't talk to us.

1763
02:02:10,824 --> 02:02:12,492
We figure maybe
they're hiding him.

1764
02:02:13,076 --> 02:02:15,620
They'll talk with you, Major.
Would you help us?

1765
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:19,249
Well, would you give
me one good reason why I should?

1766
02:02:21,335 --> 02:02:23,211
We figured we'd
give him a break.

1767
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,921
We haven't reported
him as yet.

1768
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:27,049
We could get him
on another plane.

1769
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:29,134
We might not have
to turn him in for desertion.

1770
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:33,055
- Desertion?
-Yes, sir.

1771
02:02:36,933 --> 02:02:38,101
Well...

1772
02:02:39,811 --> 02:02:41,438
I'll go with
you in a minute.

1773
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:43,148
Major?

1774
02:02:43,607 --> 02:02:46,109
The neighbors won't
talk if they see an MP.

1775
02:02:46,151 --> 02:02:47,277
I'll go with him.

1776
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:48,904
Thank you, sir.

1777
02:03:49,506 --> 02:03:50,757
Kelly?

1778
02:03:54,094 --> 02:03:55,679
Kelly, Gruver out here.

1779
02:03:58,181 --> 02:03:59,516
I think he's in there.

1780
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:02,853
Kelly?

1781
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:06,606
I'm going on in.

1782
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:21,746
Kelly?

1783
02:04:29,171 --> 02:04:30,213
Kelly?

1784
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:39,389
Kelly, you in there?

1785
02:05:03,497 --> 02:05:04,998
Oh, my God.

1786
02:05:08,919 --> 02:05:09,920
Oh, my...

1787
02:05:18,887 --> 02:05:19,888
Oh...

1788
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:22,891
Oh.

1789
02:05:31,107 --> 02:05:32,234
Oh.

1790
02:05:34,361 --> 02:05:35,445
Oh.

1791
02:05:39,074 --> 02:05:41,117
I'll call the police, Ace.

1792
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:00,345
Oh, God.

1793
02:07:37,734 --> 02:07:40,570
Go home! Go home!

1794
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:46,076
Go home! Go home! Go home!

1795
02:07:46,785 --> 02:07:50,413
Ace, there's no police around.
We'd better get out of here.

1796
02:07:52,082 --> 02:07:53,208
Hey, look.

1797
02:08:01,299 --> 02:08:02,759
Doesn't look too good, boy.

1798
02:08:06,096 --> 02:08:09,099
Go home! Go home!

1799
02:08:09,891 --> 02:08:11,309
Come on, take it easy.

1800
02:08:44,384 --> 02:08:46,094
We're getting help, Ace.

1801
02:08:59,858 --> 02:09:01,901
- You okay, boy?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1802
02:09:01,985 --> 02:09:03,236
You all right?

1803
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:04,404
Yeah.

1804
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:06,406
Listen, I'm going to...

1805
02:09:07,449 --> 02:09:09,617
I want you to take care of everything.
Will you?

1806
02:09:09,659 --> 02:09:11,327
- Oh, yeah, I'll get it...
- Okay.

1807
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:13,538
I'll see you later.

1808
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:02,670
Hey, where's Hana-ogi?

1809
02:10:02,712 --> 02:10:03,963
Hana-ogi's not here.

1810
02:10:04,047 --> 02:10:05,673
Oh, I know she's here.

1811
02:10:05,715 --> 02:10:07,258
She is on her way Tokyo.

1812
02:10:07,342 --> 02:10:09,719
No, she wasn't... She wasn't
supposed to go to Tokyo till next week.

1813
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:10,970
She went today.

1814
02:10:11,054 --> 02:10:12,514
I don't believe you.

1815
02:10:12,555 --> 02:10:14,724
- Mr. Gruver...
- I don't believe you.

1816
02:10:14,891 --> 02:10:15,892
I don't care...

1817
02:11:02,981 --> 02:11:04,315
Hana-ogi?

1818
02:11:14,951 --> 02:11:17,996
Hana-ogi. Hana-ogi.

1819
02:11:18,663 --> 02:11:19,956
Hana-ogi.

1820
02:11:30,383 --> 02:11:31,467
Hana-ogi?

1821
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:40,184
Gruver-san!

1822
02:11:40,268 --> 02:11:42,478
-Hey, where's Hana-ogi?
- She's gone.

1823
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,022
- Where's her room?
-She's gone.

1824
02:11:44,105 --> 02:11:45,940
Listen, where's her room?

1825
02:11:46,858 --> 02:11:48,192
Come here.

1826
02:11:51,905 --> 02:11:54,032
Hana-ogi really gone, Major.

1827
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:56,284
I don't believe you.

1828
02:11:57,035 --> 02:11:58,453
Hana-ogi.

1829
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:06,336
I give you my word.

1830
02:12:07,003 --> 02:12:08,922
You go now, too, Major.

1831
02:12:09,756 --> 02:12:11,090
It's over.

1832
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:14,510
Listen, leave me
alone a minute, will you?

1833
02:12:31,027 --> 02:12:34,364
The hoodlums who attacked
you weren't all your Japanese neighbors.

1834
02:12:34,614 --> 02:12:36,699
For the most part, they were
professional troublemakers

1835
02:12:36,741 --> 02:12:40,203
sent to your street
to create an incident specifically with you.

1836
02:12:40,995 --> 02:12:42,914
Now, if you're important
to those who hate us,

1837
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:46,417
don't you see how
important you are to us?

1838
02:12:49,379 --> 02:12:51,381
Do you understand
any of this, Lloyd?

1839
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:56,302
I know how you feel.

1840
02:12:56,636 --> 02:12:57,887
It was...

1841
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:01,474
It was dreadful about
your friend Kelly and...

1842
02:13:02,642 --> 02:13:03,935
And his wife.

1843
02:13:06,437 --> 02:13:08,231
Must be hard to take.

1844
02:13:10,858 --> 02:13:11,943
And I...

1845
02:13:12,026 --> 02:13:16,322
I hate to tell you
something else, because it's

1846
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:19,242
almost too grotesque.

1847
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:24,831
Almost unforgivable in
your eyes, I imagine.

1848
02:13:25,748 --> 02:13:27,500
I got word today that...

1849
02:13:29,168 --> 02:13:31,754
There's a law being passed
in a month or two

1850
02:13:32,714 --> 02:13:35,216
that will make it possible
for men like Kelly

1851
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:40,138
to take their
Japanese brides back to the States.

1852
02:13:44,726 --> 02:13:46,269
That can't be true, General.

1853
02:13:46,811 --> 02:13:49,397
Well, it happens
to be true, Lloyd.

1854
02:13:54,944 --> 02:13:56,195
Listen.

1855
02:13:57,071 --> 02:13:59,615
How do you get
the guts to come here and tell me that?

1856
02:14:00,575 --> 02:14:03,244
It takes time to get
laws passed, Lloyd.

1857
02:14:03,286 --> 02:14:07,457
And a lot of people have died
in this world needlessly, waiting for them.

1858
02:14:08,666 --> 02:14:09,709
Well, it's...

1859
02:14:09,792 --> 02:14:12,462
It's harder to take
when it hits you personally.

1860
02:14:15,506 --> 02:14:16,632
Lloyd...

1861
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:19,969
You're lost. You're confused.

1862
02:14:21,971 --> 02:14:25,391
Don't you think it's time you got back
to the main stream of your life?

1863
02:14:26,017 --> 02:14:27,143
Back to your roots?

1864
02:14:27,185 --> 02:14:29,145
What you were born for,
and raised for?

1865
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,607
You'll feel better
about everything when you get back home,

1866
02:14:32,648 --> 02:14:34,609
back to your work.

1867
02:14:37,904 --> 02:14:39,739
Appreciate you
coming over, General.

1868
02:15:22,115 --> 02:15:24,325
Take me to the airport, Mike.

1869
02:15:30,206 --> 02:15:31,999
That must be him.

1870
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,043
Would you hold it,
so we can get a picture, General?

1871
02:15:34,127 --> 02:15:36,671
- Where would you like me? Right here?
-What about there? Yeah.

1872
02:15:38,756 --> 02:15:39,882
Smile, please.

1873
02:15:46,472 --> 02:15:48,349
Hey, Bill, isn't
that Ace Gruver?

1874
02:15:49,308 --> 02:15:50,393
Looks like him.

1875
02:15:53,229 --> 02:15:54,313
Sir?

1876
02:15:55,565 --> 02:15:58,151
Excuse me, aren't
you Major Gruver? Ace Gruver?

1877
02:15:58,234 --> 02:15:59,360
Yes, that's right.

1878
02:15:59,402 --> 02:16:00,736
Well, we're
from Stars and Stripes.

1879
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:02,238
What are you doing
in Tokyo?

1880
02:16:02,864 --> 02:16:05,449
Well, I'm just passing
through, boys.

1881
02:16:05,533 --> 02:16:07,034
Just seeing the sights, huh?

1882
02:16:07,076 --> 02:16:10,580
That's right. Listen, I'm in a hurry.
Do you mind if I excuse myself?

1883
02:16:10,621 --> 02:16:12,415
- You're excused.
-Sorry.

1884
02:18:30,886 --> 02:18:31,929
Lloyd-san.

1885
02:18:54,285 --> 02:18:55,911
Hello, Hana-ogi.

1886
02:18:59,165 --> 02:19:01,751
I'm going back to
America on Friday.

1887
02:19:03,169 --> 02:19:05,087
And I probably won't

1888
02:19:06,297 --> 02:19:08,257
get back in Japan again.

1889
02:19:11,427 --> 02:19:13,804
And before I go,
there was just...

1890
02:19:15,681 --> 02:19:17,767
Just one thing
I wanted to know.

1891
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:23,439
You remember one
time you said to me...

1892
02:19:25,983 --> 02:19:27,985
That you could love me

1893
02:19:29,945 --> 02:19:32,114
and be a wife and a mother?

1894
02:19:33,783 --> 02:19:35,117
I remember.

1895
02:19:38,079 --> 02:19:41,290
You said that since
you'd known me, you'd been afraid

1896
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:44,960
of being
a lonely old woman, teaching dancing.

1897
02:19:45,795 --> 02:19:47,296
Remember that?

1898
02:19:48,798 --> 02:19:50,174
I remember.

1899
02:19:51,967 --> 02:19:55,054
Did you mean that
when you said it, Hana-ogi?

1900
02:19:56,597 --> 02:19:57,973
I meant it.

1901
02:19:58,891 --> 02:20:00,768
It is already happening.

1902
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:03,979
Love has gone out
of my work, out of me.

1903
02:20:05,689 --> 02:20:08,150
Oh, Lloyd, please go now.

1904
02:20:09,068 --> 02:20:11,654
This will only
bring pain and trouble.

1905
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:15,408
Hana-ogi,

1906
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:18,786
you and I are going
to have more trouble

1907
02:20:18,828 --> 02:20:20,830
than we ever
thought of having in our whole lives

1908
02:20:20,871 --> 02:20:23,833
unless you're
absolutely honest with yourself.

1909
02:20:26,669 --> 02:20:30,172
Please, Lloyd, can't we
talk about this later?

1910
02:20:32,842 --> 02:20:34,844
There isn't
going to be any later.

1911
02:20:34,927 --> 02:20:36,887
There's only going
to be right now.

1912
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:38,931
Oh, uh,

1913
02:20:39,181 --> 02:20:40,182
excuse me, Mother.

1914
02:20:41,308 --> 02:20:42,309
Excuse me.

1915
02:20:45,938 --> 02:20:47,606
I must return this robe.

1916
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:49,066
Listen to me.

1917
02:20:49,150 --> 02:20:53,028
I want to know.
Do you love me, or don't you?

1918
02:20:55,114 --> 02:20:57,032
Because if you don't,

1919
02:20:57,116 --> 02:20:59,743
then I'm going to
have to find a way to live with it.

1920
02:21:00,828 --> 02:21:02,872
- And if you do, then...
- Please, Lloyd.

1921
02:21:05,207 --> 02:21:07,501
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1922
02:21:11,005 --> 02:21:14,383
Now, I don't want you
to tell me anything more,

1923
02:21:14,425 --> 02:21:18,095
or anything less than
you feel in the very deepest part of you.

1924
02:21:19,263 --> 02:21:20,890
Because what you
answer to me now

1925
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:23,642
is going to affect us
for the rest of our lives.

1926
02:21:26,604 --> 02:21:29,273
Do you love me, Hana-ogi,
or don't you love me?

1927
02:21:33,444 --> 02:21:35,738
I'm so frightened
and confused.

1928
02:21:36,405 --> 02:21:37,948
I cannot think.

1929
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,242
I cannot even
understand your thinking.

1930
02:21:40,326 --> 02:21:42,036
I'm not thinking!
I'm not thinking...

1931
02:21:42,077 --> 02:21:45,372
For the first time in my life,
I'm not thinking, and I don't care.

1932
02:21:46,916 --> 02:21:49,001
But, Lloyd, we must
do the right thing.

1933
02:21:49,084 --> 02:21:51,754
Oh, what are you talking
about, the right thing?

1934
02:21:51,837 --> 02:21:53,589
We've been wasting
two good lives

1935
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:54,798
trying to do
the right thing.

1936
02:21:54,882 --> 02:21:56,258
The right thing
for Matsubayashi,

1937
02:21:56,342 --> 02:21:58,928
the right thing
for my father,

1938
02:21:58,969 --> 02:22:00,179
the right thing
for the military,

1939
02:22:00,262 --> 02:22:03,098
the right thing for
Japanese tradition.

1940
02:22:03,182 --> 02:22:05,601
The right thing for
the great white race.

1941
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:08,354
But we have duties
and obligations.

1942
02:22:08,437 --> 02:22:10,189
That's right, we do.

1943
02:22:10,689 --> 02:22:12,066
We have duties
and obligations.

1944
02:22:12,107 --> 02:22:15,277
And the first obligation we have
is to love each other.

1945
02:22:15,361 --> 02:22:19,198
To become man and wife,
and raise some clean, sweet children.

1946
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:21,492
And give them
the very best that we know how.

1947
02:22:22,409 --> 02:22:24,620
And if we don't
meet that obligation,

1948
02:22:24,662 --> 02:22:26,789
we ain't going to be
any good to anybody.

1949
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:31,460
We live in different worlds,
come from different races.

1950
02:22:31,919 --> 02:22:33,087
Oh.

1951
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:37,841
Honey, I want you
to be my wife.

1952
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:43,472
But what would happen to our children?
What would they be?

1953
02:22:44,056 --> 02:22:45,266
What would they be?

1954
02:22:45,808 --> 02:22:48,060
They'd be half Japanese,
half American.

1955
02:22:48,143 --> 02:22:50,646
They'd be half
yellow and half white.

1956
02:22:51,188 --> 02:22:53,816
They'd be half you,
they'd be half me.

1957
02:22:54,149 --> 02:22:56,443
That's all they're going to be.

1958
02:23:09,623 --> 02:23:12,334
Hana-ogi, I want you
to come with me now.

1959
02:23:14,253 --> 02:23:17,506
I want you to come with me now,
down to the American Consulate,

1960
02:23:19,008 --> 02:23:20,509
here in Tokyo.

1961
02:23:20,926 --> 02:23:24,430
We're gonna filling out those papers,
'cause we've only got a few days

1962
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:27,182
to get this whole thing done,
and get it out of the way.

1963
02:23:36,483 --> 02:23:37,610
Will you come?

1964
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:50,873
I'm going to wait
for you outside.

1965
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:23,614
Didn't I tell you
he'd be here?

1966
02:24:23,697 --> 02:24:25,240
- Look at this crowd!
- Wow!

1967
02:24:25,324 --> 02:24:27,284
And look who's here,
our rivals.

1968
02:24:27,368 --> 02:24:28,410
What do you know?

1969
02:24:28,494 --> 02:24:30,704
Oh, you guys heard
about it, too, huh?

1970
02:24:30,746 --> 02:24:31,789
No secrets.

1971
02:24:31,872 --> 02:24:34,083
-No secrets in this country!
-well, what are you gonna do?

1972
02:24:39,296 --> 02:24:42,341
Hello, Major.
Well, what a coincidence!

1973
02:24:42,424 --> 02:24:44,051
You got a story
for us, sir?

1974
02:24:45,594 --> 02:24:47,763
No. As a matter
of fact, I don't.

1975
02:24:47,805 --> 02:24:50,683
Oh, now, Major, you're
not going to try to deny it, are you?

1976
02:24:50,766 --> 02:24:52,768
- Deny what?
- Well, the story.

1977
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:55,604
Why won't you give us a story?
You're big news now, sir.

1978
02:24:55,688 --> 02:24:57,940
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

1979
02:25:00,693 --> 02:25:02,361
Here's Hana-ogi.
Maybe she'll talk.

1980
02:25:20,087 --> 02:25:23,465
Come on, Hana-ogi, that's not fair.
What did you say?

1981
02:25:24,717 --> 02:25:28,554
It is very difficult
for a Japanese woman to speak in public.

1982
02:25:29,930 --> 02:25:31,724
I have never done so.

1983
02:25:32,808 --> 02:25:35,018
But perhaps now
it is the time.

1984
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:39,314
Major Gruver has
asked me to be his...

1985
02:25:39,815 --> 02:25:40,983
His wife.

1986
02:25:45,154 --> 02:25:47,531
He knows there
are many people in his country

1987
02:25:47,614 --> 02:25:50,117
who will be
disturbed by this.

1988
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:52,786
I know my people
will be shocked, too.

1989
02:25:53,162 --> 02:25:55,998
But I hope they will
learn to understand

1990
02:25:56,707 --> 02:25:58,500
and someday approve.

1991
02:25:59,626 --> 02:26:03,380
We are not afraid
because we know this is right.

1992
02:26:04,715 --> 02:26:07,134
I hope I can
continue as a dancer.

1993
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:10,179
And I hope, when I am old,

1994
02:26:10,429 --> 02:26:13,223
I will be able to
teach children to dance.

1995
02:26:14,183 --> 02:26:15,517
My own children.

1996
02:26:17,019 --> 02:26:18,145
Major?

1997
02:26:18,187 --> 02:26:20,230
The big brass are
gonna yell their heads off about this.

1998
02:26:20,314 --> 02:26:22,524
And the Japanese
aren't going to like it much, either.

1999
02:26:22,608 --> 02:26:24,902
Have you got anything
to say to them, sir?

2000
02:26:27,362 --> 02:26:28,405
Yeah.

2001
02:26:29,865 --> 02:26:31,366
Tell them we said sayonara.

2002
02:26:31,617 --> 02:26:35,204
Sayonara

2003
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:38,999
Japanese goodbye

2004
02:26:39,291 --> 02:26:42,878
Whisper sayonara

2005
02:26:43,086 --> 02:26:46,757
Lover, don't you cry

2006
02:26:47,174 --> 02:26:50,719
No more we stop to see

2007
02:26:50,969 --> 02:26:54,556
Pretty cherry blossom

2008
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:58,811
No more we beneath the tree

2009
02:26:58,894 --> 02:27:02,314
Looking at the sky

2010
02:27:02,898 --> 02:27:06,151
Sayonara

2011
02:27:06,735 --> 02:27:10,405
Sayonara

2012
02:27:10,614 --> 02:27:14,660
Goodbye
