1

00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:34,003
Sayonara

2

00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:44,563
Sayonara

3

00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:53,604
Sayonara

4

00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:25,008
Sayonara

5

00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:31,448
Japanese goodbye

6

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,651
Just like a bird!

7

00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,451
How many did you get, sir?

8

00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,292
Hey, he got two more!

9

00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,251
-Four? Old Gruver got two more...

10

00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,132
Nice going there, sir!

11

00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:36,973
Mmm-hmm.

12

00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:40,412
Now, let's try the other lung. Breathe.

13

00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,932
- Breathe.
- Hi, padre.

14

00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,972
- Breathe.
-Two more MiGs today I hear, Lloyd.

15

00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,133
Yeah.

16

00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,293
Yeah, that's it. You can put it on.

17

00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:53,413
Okay-

18

00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,293
Well, Ace, you've had it.

19

00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:58,774
Say what?

20

00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,094
You're through flying, for a while, anyway.

21

00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:03,333
Oh, no, nothing wrong with me

22

00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,574
a little bottle of beer isn't going to fix up.

23

00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,694
Give him a bottle of beer
and send him back out.

24

00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:10,534
Look, now,
just don't get yourself excited here.

25

00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:11,974
Don't get pale, Gruver.

26

00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:14,054
I was just giving you a rib.

27

00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,175
But you could use some sleep.

28

00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:19,694
Yeah, I could use a little nice Korean sleep.

29

00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,694
Mmm, better than that.

30

00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:24,054
You're going to Japan.

31

00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,375
I'm going to Japan? What for?

32

00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:28,615
Why not?

33

00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:32,376
Wouldn't you like to tango with one
of those beautiful Japanese dolls?

34

00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:33,695
Well, if it's your prescription, Doc,

35

00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,336
then I'll certainly work at it the best I can.

36

00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,536
You're going to Kobe.

37

00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:40,935
Kelly has your orders.

38

00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,495
What in the world am I going to do in Kobe?

39

00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,056
Well, it's a special request

40

00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:48,016
of General Webster himself.

41

00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,896
Then this has all been pre-arranged.

42

00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:55,376
Pre-arranged? Demanded.

43

00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,577
Why shouldn't a three-star general

44

00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:00,697
look out for a four-star general’s son?

45

00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,296
Now, don't be getting on my back.

46

00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:03,817
I ain't bucking for favors.

47

00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,097
I know you're not. I was just kidding.

48

00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,217
I'll see you, Doc. Thanks.

49

00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,057
Could I have a word with you, Gruver?

50

00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:11,137
Yeah, I'll bet you I know what the word is.

51

00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,297
K-E-L-L-Y. Is that true or false?

52

00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,657
He's got permission to go back

53

00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:16,498
and marry that Japanese girl.

54

00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:20,017
Well, I told him he can't
take her back to the States.

55

00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:21,938
I explained the law in detail myself.

56

00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:24,738
But there's no law
which says he can't marry her.

57

00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,578
And he's appealed to his congressman.

58

00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,218
His congressman?

59

00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,138
I wish you'd
talk to him.

60

00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,259
After all, he is one of your men.

61

00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,299
And you're the only human being
he looks up to.

62

00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,059
Now, listen, I...

63

00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,658
You know, I'm going to tell you something.

64

00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,138
That boy don't look up to anybody.

65

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:43,259
He has been promoted four times

66

00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,379
and busted right back again.

67

00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,979
Yeah, my congressman.
Shocking, ain't it, Major?

68

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,940
Chaplain says, "Don't marry the girl."

69

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,580
Colonel says, "Don't marry the girl."

70

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,579
You say, "Don't marry the girl."

71

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,860
Congressman says,
"You marry that girl, Kelly."

72

00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,340
What can I do?

73

00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,100
I'll tell you what you can do, boy.

74

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,660
You can go home
and marry your congressman.

75

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,420
You'd be better off.

76

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,820
Give me more coffee.

77

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes, sir.

78

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
Hear you bagged two more today, Major.

79

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,900
- Yes.
-How was it up there?

80

00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,701
Oh, it was splendid.

81

00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:24,461
What's the matter? What happened?

82

00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,621
There was a guy
with a face in one of those planes today.

83

00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:33,182
Well, there was a guy with a face

84

00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:34,982
in all the other seven you shot down.

85

00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:38,502
Yeah.

86

00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:42,022
That's exactly what
I've been thinking about.

87

00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,422
Well, you can stop thinking.

88

00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,583
You got a very well-written contract here.

89

00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,023
General Webster's had you assigned

90

00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:53,503
to the Interservice
Aviation Board over there.

91

00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,583
Which means
you've got practically nothing to do

92

00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,743
except, of course, marry
the General's daughter,

93

00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,743
who is arriving in Kobe tomorrow.

94

00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:04,263
You mean, Eileen...

95

00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:05,383
That's right.

96

00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,904
General’s wife
and daughter both, from Tulsa.

97

00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:08,544
Listen, don't fool me now.

98

00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,743
I'm not fooling, Major.

99

00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:12,504
You're not supposed to
know anything about it. Big surprise.

100

00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:15,784
Eileen’s coming to Kobe.

101

00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:17,784
Yeah.

102

00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,665
General Webster
arranges it for you to marry his daughter.

103

00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:23,824
My congressman
arranges it for me to marry my girl.

104

00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:25,944
Generals for the officers,

105

00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:27,824
congressmen for the peasants.

106

00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:30,984
Listen, I'm glad you brought that up, boy.

107

00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:32,905
Because I think there's a little bit

108

00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,145
of difference that we ought to talk about.

109

00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:36,585
What do you mean?

110

00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,265
Well, now, listen.

111

00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:41,705
I never did show you
a picture of my girl, did I, Kelly?

112

00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:42,746
No.

113

00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:46,026
Well, I'm gonna show you a picture of a girl.

114

00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:48,906
It happens to be my girl,
but she's American.

115

00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:51,706
And I want you
to take a long, long look at her

116

00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,826
because I believe that maybe you've forgot

117

00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,746
what an American girl looks like.

118

00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:59,386
And this girl I'm going to show to you

119

00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,787
is, first of all, an American girl,

120

00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:04,426
a girl with fine character,

121

00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:06,506
a girl with good background,

122

00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:09,427
good education, good family, good blood.

123

00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,786
I've known this girl
since I was about that high.

124

00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,827
Our families are very close.

125

00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:18,108
I've been engaged to this girl
for a long time, Kelly.

126

00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:21,187
Now, she's a girl of unusual character

127

00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,188
and I'd like you to take a look at her,

128

00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,668
a close look, and tell me what you think.

129

00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,788
Tell me what your feeling is.

130

00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,468
Kind of beat-up, ain't she?

131

00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,108
I beg your pardon?

132

00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:40,148
No, that... The beat-up one's
her mother, you idiot. Not...

133

00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,669
Here's Eileen now. Wait...

134

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:44,908
That's... Now, now.

135

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,909
Hey. Boy, she sure
does something wicked to a bathing suit.

136

00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,909
Well, she has an enormous capacity
to fulfill a bathing suit.

137

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,629
-I can see that.
-That's enough, that's enough.

138

00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:57,389
Listen, I'm just,
you know, showing it to you,

139

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,910
but all kidding aside,
the reason I want to show you this girl...

140

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,950
Hey, you ever seen Katsumi?

141

00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,389
Where's that?

142

00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,830
It's not a "Where's that?"

143

00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,310
That's the girl I'm marrying.

144

00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,710
Oh. Well, no.

145

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,950
I mean,
I don't know Japanese names.

146

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,030
That's all right. Forget it.

147

00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:19,870
- Well?
- -Oh, yeah.

148

00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,191
Looks like a bright girl.

149

00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,231
She's a whole lot brighter than me.

150

00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:27,951
Well, that ain't too hard to do, you know.

151

00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:31,331
Listen, Kelly,
I want to say something seriously to you.

152

00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,731
Don't you think you're taking a risk

153

00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,592
in marrying this Japanese girl?

154

00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:37,151
Risks don't scare me any.

155

00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:40,052
Look, Major, the Army and the Air Force
and the State Department

156

00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,332
have all ganged up
to keep me from getting married.

157

00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,532
Oh, hold on, Kelly.

158

00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,192
I mean, what do you mean ganged up?

159

00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:48,392
Here, look at these pamphlets.

160

00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,552
"Think it over, Americans.

161

00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,673
"Things you are required to know and do
before marrying Orientals."

162

00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:55,753
Yeah.

163

00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,592
Here's another piece of garbage.

164

00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:59,792
"But will your family accept her?"

165

00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:01,073
Will they, Kelly?

166

00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,792
I ain't got any family.

167

00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:06,673
Listen, Kelly, I haven't
got anything against this girl of yours.

168

00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:09,433
I haven't got anything against
the Japanese anymore.

169

00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,073
I mean, not really.

170

00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,553
But, you know, when...

171

00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:18,954
I just don't understand
how a normal, average American...

172

00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,154
I mean, let's put it this way.

173

00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:23,954
I think even your friends are gonna

174

00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:26,394
put you down if you marry this girl.

175

00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:28,514
If the friends I got are that kind,

176

00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,275
they won't be friends of mine much longer.

177

00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,795
Look, Major,

178

00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,634
I'm gonna marry my girl if I have to give up

179

00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,554
my American citizenship to do it.

180

00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:39,995
Oh, Kelly, you stupid, ignorant slob!

181

00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,435
I mean, go ahead and marry

182

00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,355
this slant-eyed runt if you want to.
It'll serve you right.

183

00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:45,556
Now, wait a minute, Major!

184

00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,315
Don't talk to me that way!

185

00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,076
I won't take that from you or anybody else!

186

00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,036
I'm sorry, Kelly.

187

00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,596
I'm sorry.

188

00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,676
I'm just blowing my stack a little today.

189

00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,356
But, boy, I mean it. I...

190

00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:09,557
I want to tell you, when you tell me

191

00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,356
that you're gonna give up your citizenship

192

00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:15,437
for a girl, I mean any girl,

193

00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:18,117
I think you're nuts.

194

00:11:18,597 --> 00:11:20,477
I mean, I think you're crazy.

195

00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:21,877
I am crazy.

196

00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:23,797
I'm in-love crazy.

197

00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,557
I think you're going to cut your throat

198

00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,758
and I'd just hate to see you do it.

199

00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,157
And I mean this with all sincerity.

200

00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:32,198
Maybe that's because you don't feel

201

00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,598
as strong about your girl as I do mine.

202

00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,958
There's your orders, Major.
See you on the plane.

203

00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:48,919
Okay-

204

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,559
Kelly.

205

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,040
Well, we're coming in, Major.

206

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,120
There's the Inland Sea. Beautiful, ain't it?

207

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,279
Yeah.

208

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,240
Boy, it sure is
nice scenery out there.

209

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,120
That's Kobe over there.
You see it, with all the docks?

210

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
Oh?

211

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
You know, what you're
looking at, Major,

212

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,720
really is three cities, you know,
all running together.

213

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,160
There's Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto.

214

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
They got Kabuki there.

215

00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,440
What's Kabuki?

216

00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:27,360
You never heard
of Kabuki theater?

217

00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:29,241
- No.
- All men, no dames.

218

00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,561
That's going to be dull, isn't it?

219

00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,241
Oh, I don't know.

220

00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,281
Well, if it's all dames you want,

221

00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,482
I think we're going to get there in about...

222

00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,402
Yep. Look down there.

223

00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:42,522
See that? See that little park over
there with the little lakes around it?

224

00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,042
That's Matsubayashi.

225

00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,522
- Where?
- Right down in there.

226

00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:47,002
- -You see it?
- Oh, yeah.

227

00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:49,561
The Matsubayashi girls
are the most famous girls in all of Japan.

228

00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:50,922
You know, they sing, they dance,

229

00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:52,762
they act all the parts, no men.

230

00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,282
Katsumi knows all the actresses.

231

00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:55,602
She's like a movie fan or something.

232

00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,682
Listen, you're just blowing your top

233

00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,722
about seeing Katsumi, aren't you?

234

00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:00,962
Carrying on.

235

00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,403
She's my girl, Major.

236

00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:18,523
Well, GG, good to see you.

237

00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:19,684
So long, Lloyd. Lots of luck to you.

238

00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,044
Oh, good enough. Thank you. Bye-bye.

239

00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,043
Lloyd! Lloyd, here we are!

240

00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,804
- Lloyd!
- Come on.

241

00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,244
Hey, there!

242

00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,644
Don't forget to act surprised.

243

00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,364
Yeah. Hi, there! Hot dog!

244

00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,285
Oh, won't he be surprised!

245

00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:38,325
-Major?
- Yeah. Huh?

246

00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:42,084
How about being my best man?

247

00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:48,525
Now, listen, Kelly, I told you
that I'm against this marriage.

248

00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,766
It would mean a lot to me.
What do you say, Major?

249

00:13:58,366 --> 00:13:59,405
Okay-

250

00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:03,126
Consul’s Office, 10:00, Saturday.

251
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,326
Well, come on, honey. Hurry up.

252

00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,487
Well, now, hello! Come here, you!

253

00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,766
-Ha, ha! You're good...
- Bless your heart.

254

00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,286
-Certainly good to see you.
- Hi, Lloyd.

255

00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,767
Hi, sir. Nice to see you.

256

00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:24,887
You know, I was getting off the plane.

257

00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,727
And I said, "There's General Webster
standing over there.

258

00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,767
"But who is that good-looking woman?"

259

00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:30,608
Listen, tell me about Eileen. How is she?

260

00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,648
Oh, she finds Tulsa terribly dull
without you, Lloyd.

261

00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,368
Well, you know, I think...
I wish she could have come along.

262

00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,648
Oh, now, Lloyd,
you couldn't expect us to bring her out here.

263

00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:39,808
Well, I know that, but...

264

00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,768
You're registered at the hotel
with us for the first few nights,

265

00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,608
but you'll be stationed
out here at the field after that.

266

00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:44,768
I see.

267

00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:46,248
Come on, let's go. Now, you get in first.

268

00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:47,368
No, you go ahead, Mrs. Webster, honey.

269

00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:49,648
- No, you get in first.
- No, no, you got...

270

00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:50,728
- Go on. Get in!
-No, no.

271

00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,328
Ladies first. What's the matter with you?

272

00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,609
Hi, Lloyd.

273

00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,728
You devil.

274

00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:01,768
Come here. Mmm-mmm!

275

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,650
Mmm.

276

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,329
I'm glad to see you, darling.

277

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,329
I forgot what an ugly girl you got here.

278

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,050
Lloyd, she's not ugly. She's a beautiful girl.

279

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,210
What are you talking about?
She's the ugliest girl I ever saw.

280

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,451
- Come here, you.
-Oh.

281

00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:29,130
And that dress, I think it's terrible.

282

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,931
It just goes in and out... That's awful.

283

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,971
It's meant to go in and out.

284

00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,571
I go in and out.

285

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,931
Well, we'll talk about that later.

286

00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:52,052
Send Major Gruver's
luggage up to his room, will you?

287

00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,651
That's beautiful, isn't it?

288

00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:55,492
Are there any rules against it?

289

00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,612
Oh, no, there are no rules against it.
But it's understood...

290

00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,292
I thought the club would be honored!

291

00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,212
Please, Mike, let's go.

292

00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:06,092
What's she doing here?

293

00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,332
Mother!

294

00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,093
Well, isn't she with that young officer?

295

00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,532
You know, this is a...

296

00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,412
Kobe's a recreation center.

297

00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:13,693
That's right, dear.

298

00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,613
It degrades the uniform.
It's out-and-out fraternization.

299

00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:17,733
Mother, she's beautiful.

300

00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,973
All the more reason. Mark?

301

00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,094
-Colonel Crawford?
- Yes, sir?

302

00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,574
Let's get out of this clip joint.

303

00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:26,693
Just a minute, Captain Bailey.

304

00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,773
What's the trouble?

305

00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,854
Oh, I didn't mean
to bother you with this, General.

306

00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:34,654
But Captain Bailey here
is wanting to take her into the club.

307

00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,734
General Webster, sir.

308

00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:41,094
This young lady is one of
Japan's most famous dancers.

309

00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,215
She's no ordinary...

310

00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,575
Yes, I understand.

311

00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:48,575
Even so, don't you realize

312

00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:51,295
this club is only for American personnel?

313

00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:52,655
Now...

314

00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,735
We've been pretty easy
about fraternization in this area,

315

00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,335
even though there are
very strict orders against it.

316

00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:04,496
But, when an officer
who should be an example...

317

00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:06,215
Am I to understand, sir,

318

00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,456
that you personally refuse to allow me

319

00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,695
to take this young lady into the club?

320

00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:14,856
I understand how you feel, Captain,
and I'm very embarrassed.

321

00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:17,096
But I'm sorry.

322

00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,217
Thank you.

323

00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,776
Thank you, sir!

324

00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:21,296
Don't you know that there's such a thing

325

00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,857
as insolence through manner?

326

00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,416
Thank you, sir.

327

00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:35,498
Well, come on in, boys.
Eileen has to change.

328

00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,378
Oh, Lloyd, Eileen’s taking you
to the Kabuki tonight.

329

00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,497
Oh, good.

330

00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:40,737
We met Mr. Nakamura, the head actor,

331

00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:42,338
and he invited her to come.

332

00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,457
Now, Kabuki, isn't that the place
where there are no dames

333

00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:47,018
and the men play all the women parts?

334

00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:49,097
Oh, that's right.
The way they do at Princeton.

335

00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,378
Come on, Mark.

336

00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,738
Gonna be fun. Come on, baby.

337

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,779
You bring your lunch?

338

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,940
Miss Eileen Webster.

339

00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:13,263
Who'd you find there?

340

00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,143
Oh, that's Nakamura.
He's the one I met. He's very famous.

341

00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,023
- That Nakamura?
- Uh-huh.

342

00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:22,222
It's about a lady who turns into a lion.

343

00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,623
He's going...
She's going to turn into a lion right here?

344

00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:26,863
Uh-huh.

345

00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:28,623
I want to see that.

346

00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:51,344
I love you, Lloyd. I love you terribly.

347

00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,945
I always have, and I guess I always will.

348

00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,585
I love you, honey.

349

00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,985
Awful glad you're here, too.

350

00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:12,946
Everybody acting like nobody
ever kisses a woman.

351

00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:52,388
She wouldn't be half so ugly

352

00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,988
if she didn't stick her face
in that flour barrel.

353

00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:56,068
She?

354

00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,068
Well, whatever it was.

355

00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:01,748
You got me.

356

00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,109
He's a male actress.

357

00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:13,868
It says here they've been
trained since childhood

358

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:15,189
to have the grace of a woman,

359

00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:16,549
and yet the power of a man.

360

00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:17,909
Oh, my word.

361

00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:22,389
My Lord, that's my father!

362

00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,111
Is he man enough now for you, Lloyd?

363

00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,511
Is that the same fellow?

364

00:21:55,591 --> 00:21:56,751
Uh-huh.

365

00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:16,472
All right, boy.

366

00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:29,593
I am sure it must be very difficult

367

00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:33,113
to enjoy theater so different from your own.

368

00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,633
Well, we found it fascinating.

369

00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:36,954
I am glad.

370

00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,514
Kabuki is very old, isn't it?

371

00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:42,514
Mmm. Some 300 years.

372

00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:46,834
I find myself becoming intrigued
by everything in Japan.

373

00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:50,154
I should be happy to help you
know my country better

374

00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,954
if at any time I can.

375

00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:58,234
You did not enjoy the evening
so much, I fear, Major Gruver.

376

00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:01,114
Oh, yeah, I thought it was a fine play.

377

00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:06,435
I thought maybe you could use a Marilyn
Monroe here and there, you know, to...

378

00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,515
Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred

379

00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:15,835
from Kabuki in the 17th century.

380

00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:18,876
Well, I didn't mean to sound corny.

381

00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,356
I just didn't know what to say about it.

382

00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:23,596
Oh, please, do not apologize.

383

00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:28,356
I am great admirer of Miss Monroe myself.

384

00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:31,836
That's two of us. That's you and me, boy.

385

00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,596
- Oh, no, don't do it to me.
- Oh, no, thank you.

386

00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:40,117
I did real good. Thank you very much.

387

00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,917
- Fine art.
-Let's go and see the garden.

388

00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,917
Okay, you go on. I'll take this.

389

00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:49,797
That's fine. Fine cooking. Very good.

390

00:23:57,598 --> 00:23:59,277
Here you are, honey.

391

00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:02,277
-No, thank you.
- Don't care for any?

392

00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:04,638
Sit down, darling.

393

00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:06,718
Mmm, you look awful pretty.

394

00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,919
I've been doing a lot of thinking
with you away, Lloyd.

395

00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,358
Answer me one thing.

396

00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,039
What's that, honey?

397

00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:19,039
Why aren't we married now?

398

00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,399
Isn't that a silly question?

399

00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,959
No, not really.

400

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,519
You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.

401

00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,399
Mmm, I suppose

402

00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,999
the Korean War might have a little
something to do with it, don't you think?

403

00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,080
Wasn't Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?

404

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
Convenient?

405

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,840
What I really mean is,

406

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,880
do I mean everything to you,
as you do to me?

407

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,400
Of course you do, hon.
What are you talking about?

408

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,280
You see, I went to visit your mother

409

00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,480
before I came here, there in Richmond.

410

00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,560
My mother?

411

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,761
I was appalled at the loneliness
in which she lives

412

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,081
and the way your father is content to go off

413

00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,040
and leave her walled up
within a circle of friends

414

00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,240
while he plunges off to the war...

415

00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,201
Oh, honey, now, you just hold on a second.

416

00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,481
You got to remember something.

417

00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,521
My father's a general, honey.

418

00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,681
And besides that,
my mother wants to live that way.

419

00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:07,161
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

420

00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,482
What do you mean? Now, don't tell me...

421

00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:10,481
No woman wants to live any way except

422

00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:12,962
body and soul with the man she loves.

423

00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,241
Lloyd, you'll never tuck me away

424

00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:16,882
in the corner of some little town.

425

00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,402
Go ahead and become the greatest general

426

00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,642
in Air Force history, but love me, too.

427

00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,082
But I do love you, baby, I do.

428

00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:28,403
Well, I guess all I'm trying to say is that,

429

00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,283
and I really mean this, Lloyd,

430

00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:35,443
if what you want is a family
like our fathers have,

431

00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,803
and promotion in the Air Force,

432

00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:41,763
and position in society
like our mothers have,

433

00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:44,964
and you marry me
because I'm pretty and smart

434

00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,523
and have guts and will know the ropes,

435

00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,964
then I don't think
you ought to marry me, Lloyd.

436

00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:58,404
I'm sorry.
I guess I've been thinking too much.

437

00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:03,324
Yeah, I think you have
been thinking too much.

438

00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:23,486
Now. Now, quit it.

439

00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:25,765
Okay-

440

00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,726
Oh, I don't know, maybe things
will turn out after all.

441

00:26:28,806 --> 00:26:30,405
What do you mean
maybe it's going to turn out?

442

00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:31,766
Sure it's gonna turn out.

443

00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:33,646
It's just all that nonsense you talk about

444

00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,686
every time we get together.

445

00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:39,687
Nonsense? I...
I hadn't realized it was nonsense.

446

00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:41,207
Of course it is, honey.

447

00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:42,847
Listen, it's all very simple.

448

00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:44,247
Now, lookit.

449

00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,847
I want a wife and a family.

450

00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:49,767
I want a home in America.

451

00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:51,727
And every time I think of
having a home like that,

452

00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:54,607
I always think about it with a girl like you.

453

00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,408
I mean, a girl with a good
Army background like my own.

454

00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:01,167
What do you mean a girl like me?
I'm not a type. I'm me.

455

00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:04,328
Oh, Lloyd, it's me you've got to love.

456

00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:07,288
Oh, Lloyd, haven't you ever felt

457

00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:08,888
like grabbing me

458

00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:11,248
and hauling me off to a shack somewhere?

459

00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:12,408
What's the matter with you?

460

00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:14,208
You know better than that.
Of course I have.

461

00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:15,688
Then what's holding you back?

462

00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:17,608
Oh, Eileen,
are you ever going to grow up, honey?

463

00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,088
Don't you know there's a right time

464

00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:20,809
and a wrong time to do things?

465

00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:21,968
Aren't you ever gonna realize

466

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,689
that you have responsibilities
to other people,

467

00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,449
that you have a position to fulfill,

468

00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,369
that you're not alone in this world?

469

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,329
Oh, you defend yourself like a fort!

470

00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,049
Listen, no matter how I defend myself,

471

00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:32,329
hon, you've got to understand one thing,

472

00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:34,209
that I am not in a position

473

00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:37,290
to be hauling my fiancee away
to a shack somewhere

474

00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:38,849
like an alley cat or something like that.

475

00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,970
I wasn't brought up that way.

476

00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,130
You're going to do everything
that's expected of you?

477

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,730
Well, I'm certainly going to try,
I'll tell you that.

478

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,290
Well, I don't expect you to marry me

479

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,490
just because it's expected of you.

480

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,930
Listen, you know sometimes I look at you,

481

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,531
and I don't understand you.

482

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,930
I don't know what's going on in your brain.

483

00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,211
I think sometimes
I don't even know who you are

484

00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,251
or what... Or what you're all about.

485

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,011
Maybe you don't. Maybe you never will.

486

00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:19,331
"...so long as ye both shall live?"

487

00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:20,531
I will.

488

00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:23,532
Katsumi, "Wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband

489

00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:25,172
"to live together after God's ordinance

490

00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:26,892
"in the holiest state of matrimony?

491

00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:28,732
"Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor

492

00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,653
"and keep him, in sickness and in health

493

00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,133
"and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him,

494

00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,453
"so long as ye both shall live?"

495

00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:40,413
She will.

496

00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:41,773
She will.

497

00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:45,333
"If any man can show just cause

498

00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,973
"why they may not be
lawfully joined together

499

00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:50,694
"let him now speak, or else hereafter
forever hold his peace."

500

00:28:57,453 --> 00:29:00,494
Do you realize you waive
all your legal rights in this marriage?

501

00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:02,574
Look, I signed all the papers, didn't I?

502

00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,014
You'll look after your wife on your own.

503

00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:05,934
The Air Force is not responsible.

504

00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:08,334
Yeah, I know.

505

00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,135
Romantic, ain't it, Major?

506

00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:13,894
Will you finish this ugly deed
and get it over?

507

00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,454
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Sign over there.

508

00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:19,295
Just a minute.

509

00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,256
That's it, Mrs. Kelly.

510
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,616
Just you and me now.

511

00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:53,656
Where do we sign?

512

00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:57,137
May as well witness this now, Major.

513

00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,817
Yeah, all right.

514

00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,697
Incidentally, it was a great honor
meeting you, Major Gruver.

515

00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:04,817
Well, thank you.

516

00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:07,257
Say, tell me, Consul,

517

00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:10,858
are all these ceremonies
conducted like that?

518

00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:14,418
Well, we do our best
to prevent as many as possible.

519

00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:16,658
We make the paperwork so difficult,

520

00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,258
a good many of them lose steam.

521

00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:19,578
Uh-huh.

522

00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,179
Well, about how many, uh...

523

00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:25,618
About how many Gis have gone
through this ceremony?

524

00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:30,539
Oh, about 10,000.

525

00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:34,859
Ten thousand? Well, then,
you let a few slip by you, didn't you?

526

00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:35,979
A few, yes.

527

00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:36,979
Mmm-hmm.

528

00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,779
How's your girl, Major?

529

00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,099
Oh, Eileen?

530

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,660
I haven't seen her in a couple days.

531

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,899
I've been... You know, I've been moving in,
getting my things arranged.

532

00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,139
And she's been hightailing it
with the brass, socializing.

533
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:53,700
Major,

534

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,300
ain't you going to kiss the bride?

535

00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,501
Well, sure I'm going to kiss the bride!

536

00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,221
Yeah.

537

00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:02,940
Sure.

538

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,180
Now, listen, I want you
to take good care of this boy, hear?

539

00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:13,301
Now, here's your ticket, honey.
Don't forget it.

540

00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:16,821
Okay, boy.

541

00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,501
Thanks, Major.

542

00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,141
Took a lot of guts for you
to come here today.

543

00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:23,702
Oh, quit.

544

00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:26,422
If you want anybody taken care of,
or need a job done

545

00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:27,862
that you West Point guys ain't allowed

546

00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:29,222
to do yourselves, I'm your man.

547

00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:31,782
Hold it. Now, I'm going to call on you, boy.

548

00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:32,942
Come on. Let's get a belt.

549

00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:33,982
All right.

550

00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:35,782
-Nice to see you.
- How are you, Lloyd, dear?

551

00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:37,542
Fine. Just fine.

552

00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:38,823
That's a pretty dress you got on.

553

00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:40,063
Thanks.

554

00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:41,943
Lloyd, sit down, son.

555

00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:43,503
All right.

556

00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:48,703
Thank you for coming over
so promptly, Lloyd.

557

00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,703
Well, that's all right.
I was just darning my socks.

558

00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:53,703
Lloyd, um...

559

00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:57,143
I don't know exactly how to put this.

560

00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,703
It's a little embarrassing, for me, that is.

561

00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:03,904
I understand you were a witness
at a marriage yesterday

562

00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:06,464
between one of your men
and a Japanese girl.

563

00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:11,264
Yeah, one man from my outfit in Korea.

564

00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:15,504
Well, you realize, of course,
there's an Army policy

565

00:32:15,544 --> 00:32:17,225
to discourage all such marriages.

566

00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:19,705
Yeah, well, I think they couldn't
have been discouraged.

567

00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:21,784
They're very much in love, and...

568

00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:25,065
I dare say.

569

00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,745
However, the fact that you personally

570

00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:28,945
seemed to sanction the marriage...

571

00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:32,505
Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean to give that impression at all.

572

00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,065
I didn't sanction it, and as a matter of fact,

573

00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:35,785
I tried to talk him out of it before.

574

00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:38,425
But, Lloyd, darling,
you did act as his witness.

575

00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:40,906
Well...

576

00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,386
You know, as long as
it's going to be inevitable,

577

00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:45,826
I thought I might as well try
to make it as pleasant as possible.

578

00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:48,186
Don't you see the position that puts me in?

579

00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:51,226
And since I'm the Area Commander here, I...

580

00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:53,946
No, you didn't do anything
to encourage this marriage, sir.

581

00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:56,066
I believe I did all this on my own.

582

00:32:56,147 --> 00:33:00,027
What do you mean on your own,
Lloyd, dear?

583

00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:02,267
Everything you do reflects on the General.

584

00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,267
After all, he is Eileen’s father.

585

00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,827
I'm afraid this places me in a position
of incompetence, Mrs. Webster,

586

00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:11,268
when it comes to, you know,
doing anything to help my own men.

587

00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:14,428
Let's stop beating around the bush.

588

00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:16,748
What's wrong between you and Eileen?

589

00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,428
You haven't been to see her
for several days.

590

00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:24,468
Well,

591

00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:28,748
you talked about
being embarrassed, sir, before.

592

00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,548
I'm embarrassed, too.

593

00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:34,589
- What about?
- Well, about my whole situation here.

594

00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:38,109
I'm a pilot, sir. I was doing a job in Korea.

595

00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,429
Unfinished job. Now, suddenly,
I'm pulled off that job and sent over here

596

00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:45,269
and plunked down at a desk
at this Interservice whatever it is,

597

00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:46,749
and, you know, where, as far as I can see,

598

00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,749
there's absolutely nothing to do.

599

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,789
You know, all so as I can be with Eileen.

600

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,110
There's nothing dishonest about it.

601

00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:55,030
That is, if you plan to get married.

602

00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:58,430
I think I know how Lloyd feels.

603

00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,270
Do you plan to get married or not?

604

00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,391
-Really, dear.
- Well, I'm her mother. I want to know.

605

00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,590
Well, Mrs. Webster,

606

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,391
as of the moment,
Eileen isn't too sure about it.

607

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,831
And I...

608

00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,711
Oh, we know, Lloyd, dear. Now, look.

609

00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:18,191
There's evidently been some
slight strain between you two,

610

00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,351
but don't let it become too important.

611

00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:23,111
Now, this is Sunday night.
Why don't you call her up later

612

00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,472
and ask her out to dinner or something?

613

00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:26,751
Well...

614

00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,471
Mother, I found the dearest little shop at...

615

00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:31,592
Hi, Lloyd.

616

00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:33,352
Hello, Eileen.

617

00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:35,552
Lloyd just came in to see you.

618

00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,432
-Oh?
- Oh, yeah.

619

00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:40,833
Listen...

620

00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,992
Listen, I thought
Sunday night, and I thought maybe

621

00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:47,793
you and I can go out
and catch a movie or something.

622

00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:50,113
Feel like it?

623

00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:54,432
I'm sorry, Lloyd.
I'm having dinner with some friends tonight.

624

00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:55,673
Well,

625

00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:57,993
what about tomorrow?

626

00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:00,594
That's booked, too, I'm afraid.

627

00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:06,273
Well, looks as though
I'm holding some pretty tough cards.

628

00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:12,034
What about next week?

629

00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,594
Of course, Lloyd. Call me?

630

00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:19,554
Okay-

631

00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,555
Mrs. Webster, General.

632

00:35:25,635 --> 00:35:26,595
Goodbye, Lloyd.

633

00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:28,355
- Bye, Eileen.
- Bye, Lloyd.

634

00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:38,156
Oh, Eileen. Why did you tell him
you were busy tonight?

635

00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:44,395
Because I don't want to see Lloyd Gruver
when you ask him to see me.

636

00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:46,116
Besides,

637

00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:48,195
I do have a date with that young Lieutenant

638

00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:50,115
and his wife from Fort Bragg.

639

00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:51,796
Whole bunch of us.

640

00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:00,637
I hope you don't lose my man for me.

641

00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:23,398
Boy, give me a martini, will you?

642

00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:27,198
Nope, make it lemonade.

643

00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,198
No, dog. Give me a scotch and soda.

644

00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:33,159
- Scotch and soda.
- -Yeah.

645

00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,278
Scotch and soda, sir.

646

00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:38,038
There's such a thing as insolence
through manner, you know.

647
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:47,799
Well, I hate to admit it,
but I guess that's what I said.

648

00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,839
Well, I thought it sounded kind of strange

649

00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,159
coming from a guy
who shot down nine MiGs.

650

00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,760
Well, that's kind of a reflex action.

651

00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,439
I'm a West Point man, you know.

652

00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,480
I guess, it sneaks out sometimes.

653

00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,360
Now, listen, Captain, what does a fellow do

654

00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,360
around here after the sun goes down?

655

00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:10,640
Why?

656

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
You on the loose?

657

00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:14,200
Uh... Halfway.

658

00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,680
Bring him another.

659

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,321
What part of the South are you from?

660

00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:23,601
Almost any old place
that's got an Army post on it.

661

00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,041
I was all set to take the exams at West Point

662

00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:30,281
and there was a teacher there

663

00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:33,362
who made me take a part in a school play.

664

00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:36,882
They were doing one of those
Hungarian things by Molnar.

665

00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:40,682
You never did hear a Hungarian play

666

00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:42,602
played in a Southern accent, did you?

667

00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:44,482
No, I'm afraid I missed that.

668

00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:47,162
That's a shame,
because I was awful good in it.

669

00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:51,723
Anyhow, I suddenly didn't want
to go to West Point

670

00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,603
and didn't want
to have anything to do with it.

671

00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:56,883
And my mother come up to the school,

672

00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:01,003
and she said,
"We always expected you to go to the Point

673

00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,883
"like your father and his father before him."

674

00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:06,363
And I told her,

675

00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:10,804
I said I had an idea about
a whole different way of life.

676

00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:12,883
What did she say to that?

677

00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:15,564
She said something like,

678

00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:18,204
"If I ever once had that idea,

679

00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:20,604
"I shouldn't let anything stop me."

680

00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:26,124
And she couldn't come right out and say,
"Don't go to the Point."

681

00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:28,124
You know, but I know what she meant.

682

00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,645
Then, of course,
my father flew up from Texas and...

683
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:33,165
He put you straight, huh?

684

00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:36,884
No, he just looked at me and said,

685

00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,965
"If you don't want to go to the Point,
don't go to the Point.

686

00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:42,565
"The unhappiest men I know are those

687

00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:47,485
"who are forced into something
they got no inaptitude for."

688

00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,485
How did he force you to go to the Point?

689

00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,526
That's what I'm telling you.
He didn't force me. He just...

690

00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:56,686
We just had a little talk,
and he flew back to Texas

691

00:38:56,726 --> 00:38:58,766
and I went on to the Point.

692

00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:01,446
I see.

693

00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,646
Well, uh, I'll tell you
something though, Mike.

694

00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:09,447
I never once had any regrets
about going to the Point.

695

00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,967
Except, just lately,

696

00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:15,007
I've had some old feeling come back on me.

697

00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,367
I don't know if I want to go on

698

00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:20,247
in the Air Force and buck for a star

699

00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,367
and get married in the Webster family

700

00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,687
and get swallowed up by all that.

701

00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,848
I think maybe my old lady was right.

702

00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,167
Well, what does it all mean?

703

00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:36,528
Eternal struggle, sex,

704

00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:39,088
New York Yankees.

705

00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:41,848
All right. Quit, now. Come on.

706

00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,929
Isn't that a nice-looking bridge?

707

00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:54,689
Yeah,
that's the Bitchi-Bashi.

708

00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:56,049
Say what?

709

00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,729
The Bitchi-Bashi.

710

00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,009
Bashi is Japanese for "bridge."

711

00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,649
We call this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi

712

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,010
because there's so much
lovely stuff that goes over it.

713

00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,850
Did you say stuff?

714

00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,249
Brother, I said stuff.

715

00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,290
Will you kindly tell me what
we're standing in the bushes for?

716

00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,450
-Can't touch it.
- Why not?

717

00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,451
Well, you see, these girls that go over there
are the Matsubayashi girls.

718

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,730
They just cross over there
on the way to the theater

719

00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:27,731
from those cells over there,
those dormitories.

720

00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:30,451
Oh, that's right.
Somebody told me about that.

721

00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:35,571
Hey, boy, is that anything
going over there now?

722

00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:40,452
Hey, come on.
The goods are on display.

723

00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:42,612
Wait for me, buddy.

724

00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:13,533
There's Fumiko-san.
The one you saw me with.

725

00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,333
- Yeah. The little one in pink.
- Yeah, that's the one.

726

00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:20,974
You're not going over there and say hello?

727

00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:24,054
What, in public?
A Matsubayashi girl? Are you nuts?

728

00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:26,374
Well, you take her to the officers‘ club.

729

00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:28,254
Well, that's for Americans.

730

00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:31,254
Thought I could sneak her in there
without her being recognized.

731

00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:33,655
What happens if they catch them?

732

00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,334
Immediate dismissal.

733

00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:37,014
- No fooling?
- Yeah.

734

00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,775
No Matsubayashi girl
is allowed to have dates of any kind.

735

00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,135
You were dating her, you.

736

00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:44,415
Yeah, well, I'm different.

737

00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:46,575
Oh, get out of here.

738

00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:48,855
Well, like I told President Truman,

739

00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:51,935
"Harry, you was wrong
when you sold the Marines short."

740

00:41:52,016 --> 00:41:53,816
See, I hate to be stuffy about this, son,

741

00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:55,576
but you Air Force men
just wouldn't understand.

742

00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:56,776
Lord!

743

00:41:57,376 --> 00:42:00,695
- Well, the Marines have got l’amour.
- Oh, Lord.

744

00:42:00,736 --> 00:42:02,696
And these girls, they got fame and wealth

745

00:42:02,776 --> 00:42:04,216
and bright lights.

746

00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:05,816
But they ain't got l’amour.

747

00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:07,616
-well, you got l’amour, haven't you?
- Yeah, yeah.

748

00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:17,976
What's going on there now?

749

00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,776
-Hana-ogi's coming.
- Who?

750

00:42:19,857 --> 00:42:22,257
Hana-ogi. She's the top, number one.

751

00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:27,418
Come on. Let's go.

752

00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:49,899
Well, how come she's dressed like that?

753

00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:52,499
Well, the tall ones play men's parts, mostly.

754

00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:54,699
They play women's parts, too.

755

00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:56,579
How do you do?

756

00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,860
What do you say let's see the show?

757

00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,259
Well, come on, Ace.

758

00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:40,668
- Hmm?
- I say, do you follow the plot?

759

00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:43,468
Yeah, nothing wrong with the plot.

760

00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:43,758
Listen, are you sure
they're coming back this way?

761

00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,078
Just keep yourself in check, son.

762

00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:50,637
Am I nuts, or is she
the greatest thing I ever saw?

763

00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:54,038
Whatever you're thinking, forget it.
You ain't going anyplace.

764

00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:56,558
Oh, yeah? How's this for an introduction?

765

00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:59,119
She's coming along the walk
and TIM kind of walk on by

766

00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:02,519
and slip my arm around her, just cozy style.
What do you think of that?

767

00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:04,199
I think we better go.

768

00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:05,358
- Now, wait just...
- Major!

769

00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:07,759
Hey, kiddo! How are you?

770

00:49:08,399 --> 00:49:09,519
How's everything?

771

00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:10,798
Saw you at the show.
We been looking for you.

772

00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:12,559
Listen, I want you to meet Captain Bailey.

773

00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:13,719
This is Airman Kelly.

774

00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:15,239
How are you, Kelly? Nice to meet you.

775

00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:16,960
- How do you do, sir?
- How you been, boy?

776

00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,199
Oh, fine.

777

00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:19,800
Hey. Here's Katsumi.

778

00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:21,320
Hello there, Katsumi.

779

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,879
Say something, kid.

780

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,080
It is fine to see you among us tonight.

781

00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,480
She's speaking better English
than you are, boy.

782

00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,240
She's been taking English lessons,

783

00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,200
and I've been studying a little Japanese.

784

00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,881
Let's hear you go.

785

00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,800
Uh...

786

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,441
Well, I hope he can get rid of it, don't you?

787

00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:45,601
Means "My feet are cold."
She always laughs when I say that.

788

00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,601
Listen, now you been?
How you getting along down there?

789

00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:49,921
Oh, just fine, Major.

790

00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:52,441
We got a wonderful house
down by the canal.

791

00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:53,641
Hey, Kelly, didn't you tell me

792

00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:56,322
that Katsumi knows
those Matsubayashi girls?

793

00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:58,482
Oh, sure. She's a real fan.

794

00:49:59,562 --> 00:50:01,841
Well, listen, I want you
to do something for me.

795

00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:05,121
I am trying in the worst way
to meet this Hana-ogi,

796

00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:10,082
and I want you to ask her if she won't,
you know, kind of introduce me?

797

00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:25,283
She says the rules are very strict,

798

00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:26,362
but she'll go over and ask her.

799

00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:28,283
Well, she will ask her?

800

00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:29,403
Oh, yeah.

801

00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:32,883
‘Cause you know what I said, I said
to Truman when he came over to the house,

802

00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,923
I says, "Harry," I said,
"don't ever sell the Air Force short."

803

00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:46,804
All right, boy,
now you're going to see something.

804

00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:01,285
Here comes Fumiko-san.

805

00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,005
-Here comes Hana-ogi.
- I know it.

806

00:51:28,726 --> 00:51:30,807
You ain't going to let me down, are you?
Go on.

807

00:51:30,886 --> 00:51:32,126
- It's all right, Major.
- Hmm?

808

00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,727
How do, Miss Ogi?

809

00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:55,488
You think you made the grade, Ace?

810

00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:57,488
Yes. She gave me a nice little look there.

811

00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,288
Oh, she sure did.

812

00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:22,289
Uh, she says that Hana-ogi
will not speak to an American.

813

00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:24,889
Why not?

814

00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,809
We shot her brother
and killed her father with our bombs.

815

00:52:27,889 --> 00:52:29,529
Oh, shoot. I didn't do it.

816

00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,610
Sure you did, Ace.

817

00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,490
We all did.

818

00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,530
Come on.

819

00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,290
Come on, Ace.

820

00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:57,171
Listen, if they're so strict
with you girls over there,

821

00:52:57,211 --> 00:53:00,531
how come you go out
with Mike on dates and fool around?

822

00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:02,812
It is very bad of me,

823

00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:06,011
but I cannot help myself.

824

00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:07,892
He's so tall!

825

00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:12,812
Well, he's a big boy, all right.

826

00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:15,012
I mean, there's no fooling about that.

827

00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,532
But, listen,

828

00:53:17,852 --> 00:53:20,172
what I really want to know is,

829

00:53:20,892 --> 00:53:23,012
does this Hana-ogi ever go out on dates?

830

00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:24,132
You know, like you and Mike and...

831

00:53:25,173 --> 00:53:26,172
No.

832

00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,213
She is number-one girl.

833

00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,253
Must be specially careful.

834

00:53:30,493 --> 00:53:31,453
Well,

835

00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:34,893
I want you to do me a favor.
Now, will you do it?

836

00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:38,373
When you go back to the dormitory tonight,

837

00:53:38,494 --> 00:53:40,573
I want you to tell Hana-ogi

838

00:53:40,893 --> 00:53:43,733
that Major Gruver would
like to meet her and...

839

00:53:43,773 --> 00:53:45,974
Now wait. Now wait. Just a minute.

840

00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:49,493
I just want to talk to her for a little while.

841

00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:50,654
Now, will you do that for me?

842

00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,814
Never happen!

843

00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,774
Hana-ogi-san never speak men,

844

00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:01,375
and with American, never happen.

845

00:54:02,175 --> 00:54:04,215
Well, honey, I am here to tell you

846

00:54:04,255 --> 00:54:06,214
that it's going to
happen.

847

00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:43,936
Pardon me, Miss Ogi.

848

00:54:45,537 --> 00:54:47,857
I wonder if I could...

849

00:54:47,937 --> 00:54:49,657
If I could have your autograph?

850

00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:01,138
Thank you very much.

851

00:55:19,338 --> 00:55:20,499
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

852

00:57:00,144 --> 00:57:01,464
Hi, Major.

853

00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,784
I've been looking for you.

854

00:57:04,544 --> 00:57:06,145
Hello, Mr. Kelly.

855

00:57:06,665 --> 00:57:08,585
Wife says to be at the house tonight.

856

00:57:09,864 --> 00:57:12,825
Now, listen, I'll tell you, boy, I've got a...

857

00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:17,025
I have an engagement this evening
with a friend of mine.

858

00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:21,226
Be there, bub. Hana-ogi's coming.

859

00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:23,185
Sir.

860

00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:28,226
- Kelly!
-Be there early.

861

00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:30,106
Kelly!

862

00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:00,267
- Hello.
- Hello!

863

00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:03,428
Hey. You know where Joe Kelly lives?

864

00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:05,948
--Over there?

865

00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,347
Well, you show me, will you?

866

00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:17,869
How do you do?

867

00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:31,029
Oh. Hiya, Ace.

868

00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:33,389
Hey, Kelly, is that you?

869

00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:35,150
How are you, Alice?

870

00:58:35,629 --> 00:58:36,869
-How are you, Ace? Nice to see you.
- Good. Fine.

871

00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:37,949
Come in the house.

872

00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,269
Wait a second.
Let me just take a check here.

873

00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,909
- Did she come yet?
- No, not yet.

874

00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,590
Katsumi.

875

00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:00,751
- Okay.
- What did she say?

876

00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:02,311
Don't ask me, son...

877

00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,031
Hey! Off with the shoes.

878

00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:06,030
You don't wear shoes in a Japanese house.

879

00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,191
Okay, coming off. What about the pants?

880

00:59:08,751 --> 00:59:10,511
The room on your right.

881

00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:12,231
- Where, here?
- That's it.

882

00:59:14,271 --> 00:59:16,992
Watch your head, Ace. Well, this is it.

883

00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:21,032
Well, listen, this is all right, boy.
This is cute. This is nice.

884

00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:23,392
Sit down over here, Ace. That's the
place of honor in a Japanese house.

885

00:59:23,471 --> 00:59:24,472
Over there?

886

00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:29,312
Listen, what's this thing?

887

00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,312
Oh, this is an armrest.

888

00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:32,712
Armrest?

889

00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:34,832
Well, it'll be even better
when the rest of the chair gets here.

890

00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:45,073
Hi, Katsumi, darling. How are you?

891

00:59:46,513 --> 00:59:47,593
Yeah.

892

00:59:58,433 --> 01:00:01,074
It is very nice to have you

893

01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:03,794
among us.

894

01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,474
Well, it's very nice to be among you, too.

895

01:00:18,874 --> 01:00:20,715
Listen, I brought you a little couple of things

896

01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:21,874
you can stick around the house.

897

01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:24,235
Yeah, flowers.

898

01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:30,756
You've made her very happy, Ace.

899

01:00:32,155 --> 01:00:34,996
What has she got here?
We going to eat this or wear it? What is it?

900

01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:39,796
No, this is a little towel
that they serve before a meal or a drink,

901

01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:41,956
just a little refresher
for your hands and face.

902

01:00:42,036 --> 01:00:43,956
Listen, that's a good idea.

903

01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:45,796
Wash them up.

904

01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,756
Okay, clean the ears well.
Do I pass, teacher?

905

01:00:51,236 --> 01:00:53,077
Just dump it in the basket.

906

01:00:54,637 --> 01:00:55,636
Yes, sir.

907

01:00:58,037 --> 01:00:58,997
What's this, an eyecup?

908

01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:01,237
We've got to wash our eyes out, too?

909

01:01:01,317 --> 01:01:03,677
No, that's a cup for sake.
That's a wine made out of rice.

910

01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:06,357
Rice? No fooling?

911

01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,798
Yeah, no fooling.

912

01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:09,917
- Okay, I'll try it.
-Here, taste it, you'll see.

913

01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:12,117
Feels warm.

914

01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:13,997
That's right,
we heat it up before we serve it.

915

01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,597
Really? Well...

916

01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,318
Katsumi, here's to your health.

917

01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:21,078
And, Kelly, the very best to you.

918

01:01:25,038 --> 01:01:26,478
That's all right, boy. It's not bad.

919

01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:28,479
Told you, it's wonderful.

920

01:01:28,998 --> 01:01:30,638
- Listen, aren't you going to have anything?
- Oh.

921

01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:31,958
Yeah. I was just going to say, you know,

922

01:01:31,998 --> 01:01:34,479
there's kind of a polite thing you do, like,

923

01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:37,239
you take the cup
and you swish it around in the water,

924

01:01:37,279 --> 01:01:39,319
and you pour some sake in it for her.

925

01:01:39,759 --> 01:01:40,919
Okay-

926

01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:42,039
That's right.

927

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,879
- It means "A little bit."
- Little bit, all righty.

928

01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,960
Hold on now, wait.

929

01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,440
Okay.

930

01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,200
See? Didn't hurt.

931

01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,680
Well, she's going to get me
under the table here in five minutes

932

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,761
if she's going like this.

933

01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,080
- She'll keep pouring all night.
- How...

934

01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,961
Katsumi, I pour for Gruver-san now.

935

01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,761
You excuse me? I finish cooking.

936

01:02:13,361 --> 01:02:15,361
-You go ahead, darling. Go right ahead.

937

01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:16,761
Go right ahead.

938

01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:22,682
Okay-

939

01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:27,801
Present. Whiskey.

940

01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:29,202
Whiskey?

941

01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,002
Okay-

942

01:02:35,522 --> 01:02:37,242
All right, darling.

943

01:02:48,482 --> 01:02:51,083
Listen, boy, she's just as cute as a bug.

944

01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:53,323
You ain't going...
You ain't going to lose with her.

945

01:02:53,643 --> 01:02:57,083
See what I mean, Ace?
I'm the happiest guy in the world.

946

01:02:58,003 --> 01:02:59,684
Hey. You want to see the rest of the house?

947

01:02:59,763 --> 01:03:02,523
-Yeah.
-Come on, I'll show you.

948

01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:09,564
This is the garden. Katsumi,
I'm showing him around the house.

949

01:03:13,404 --> 01:03:14,924
The bathroom is back there.

950

01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:16,445
We got a couple of extra rooms in here.

951

01:03:16,524 --> 01:03:18,205
- Would you like to see them?
-Yeah.

952

01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:22,084
Well, what have you got here, boy?

953

01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:24,004
Oh, Lord.

954

01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,685
We haven't done anything with these yet,

955

01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:31,525
but maybe someday, if we expand.

956

01:03:31,605 --> 01:03:32,765
Mmm-hmm.

957

01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:35,205
Well, listen, it's really
working out for you, isn't it, boy?

958

01:03:35,285 --> 01:03:36,606
Everything perfect,

959

01:03:36,685 --> 01:03:39,005
except for that rat of a colonel
I'm assigned to.

960

01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:42,046
You wouldn't be talking about
a fellow named Crawford, would you?

961

01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:44,126
That's the guy.
He rides every guy around here

962

01:03:44,206 --> 01:03:46,686
that's married to a Japanese girl.
Extra duty, everything.

963

01:03:46,766 --> 01:03:47,846
Yeah...

964

01:03:47,926 --> 01:03:50,566
Well, he's a rough carver.
There's no getting around that.

965

01:03:50,646 --> 01:03:54,206
Ah, so what do I care?
I come home to my girl and I forget it.

966

01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:56,446
-Let's go.
- Wait, listen, I forgot to ask you.

967

01:03:56,526 --> 01:03:59,647
Does this Hana...
This Hana-ogi speak any English?

968

01:03:59,727 --> 01:04:00,727
Because I'm going to be...

969

01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:02,846
Well, I don't know.
Those girls sing in a lot of languages.

970

01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,767
I guess she'll be able
to catch your drift, Ace.

971

01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:08,647
- You nasty boy, you.
- Come on. Let's...

972

01:04:08,727 --> 01:04:11,647
Wait a minute,
I've just got to take a look at my grass, now.

973

01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:13,447
I want to know. Are we going to be,

974

01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:16,687
you know, all four of us
going to be together all evening long?

975

01:04:16,888 --> 01:04:19,488
Take it easy, Ace.
You're going to blow a fuse.

976

01:04:20,328 --> 01:04:21,568
Well, uh...

977

01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:24,928
Might be.

978

01:04:26,448 --> 01:04:28,208
- Lord, one of us is wrong here!
- Watch your head, Ace.

979

01:04:30,048 --> 01:04:31,928
You should walk in your house, Kelly...

980

01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:34,288
Katsumi, you ready?

981

01:04:34,368 --> 01:04:35,569
Stoop-shouldered.

982

01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,168
In here? You're going to have to change...

983

01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:47,809
Hey, Kelly...

984

01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,410
Hana-ogi-san.

985

01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,370
This is a great day for our house.

986

01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,531
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

987

01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:12,851
Hey. Where are you going?

988

01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:15,130
Oh, I've got to help Katsumi with the...

989

01:05:15,171 --> 01:05:16,291
Huh?

990

01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:23,771
Well, it looks as though everybody
just ran off and left us alone here.

991

01:05:25,652 --> 01:05:29,691
It certainly was nice of you
to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.

992

01:05:29,732 --> 01:05:33,091
I was just tickled to death
when they told me you were coming over.

993

01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:35,492
Uh...

994

01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:38,212
I'll just sit down here.

995

01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:43,893
Well, Miss Ogi,

996

01:05:45,412 --> 01:05:47,652
let me fix you a little drink.

997

01:05:48,693 --> 01:05:50,372
No, now, well...

998

01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:51,732
Well, okay.

999

01:05:58,173 --> 01:05:59,333
Here's to you.

1000

01:06:01,053 --> 01:06:02,373
Mmm!

1001

01:06:02,453 --> 01:06:03,813
That's good.

1002

01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:05,733
Now, don't tell me.

1003

01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:07,813
I know you've got to slosh this
around in here a little bit

1004

01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:10,813
and get the dribble off,
and give it right back to you.

1005

01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:14,493
See, now you take that.

1006

01:06:17,134 --> 01:06:18,454
All right.

1007

01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:26,535
You know, I was surprised to find
that they make that stuff out of rice.

1008

01:06:26,614 --> 01:06:28,295
We have
rice back home in America.

1009

01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:29,815
Of course, we just...

1010

01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:32,614
Well, we just make rice pudding out of it.
And we don't drink it.

1011

01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:36,255
Uh, this is the first liquid rice I ever ran into.

1012

01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:47,175
You know, did...

1013

01:06:48,535 --> 01:06:50,136
Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,

1014

01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:52,215
that you're a fine-looking woman?

1015

01:06:53,696 --> 01:06:55,536
I mean, real fine.

1016

01:06:57,537 --> 01:07:01,097
You're even better-looking
off the stage than you are on.

1017

01:07:01,136 --> 01:07:02,536
That's true.

1018
01:07:03,017 --> 01:07:06,336
You get up there,
and sing, dance, act, everything.

1019

01:07:06,376 --> 01:07:08,297
You're all-around great.

1020

01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:16,777
I wonder, where did him and Katsumi...

1021

01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:19,257
I'm getting kind of hungry in here.

1022

01:07:24,938 --> 01:07:26,458
Look, Miss Ogi, um...

1023

01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,698
I'm not up too good
on Japanese ways of doing things,

1024

01:07:30,778 --> 01:07:33,258
and maybe I'm saying the wrong thing.

1025

01:07:33,778 --> 01:07:37,258
I mean, maybe
my American manners are embarrassing.

1026

01:07:38,218 --> 01:07:40,338
But I figure, as long as you
came over here tonight,

1027

01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:43,419
maybe you were interested
a little bit in meeting me, too.

1028

01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:46,619
Now, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm wrong,

1029

01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:49,699
then you've got to tell me.

1030

01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:51,499
Where do we go from here?

1031

01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:52,899
‘Cause I don't know what to say.

1032

01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:54,860
I'm running out of things to say.

1033

01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,260
My father was killed

1034

01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,700
by American bomb dropped on my country.

1035

01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,900
You have been my enemy.

1036

01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,340
I have hated Americans.

1037

01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:16,941
I have thought they are savages.

1038

01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:20,940
There has been nothing
but vengeance in my heart.

1039

01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,661
Miss Ogi.

1040

01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,301
There were an awful lot
of Americans that were killed, too.

1041

01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:32,021
And I think it would be best
if we forgot about that.

1042

01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:36,702
You have been watching me at the bridge.

1043

01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:39,422
Watching me dance,

1044

01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:43,902
watching me as I go back to the dormitory.

1045

01:08:45,982 --> 01:08:48,462
But I have been watching you, too,

1046

01:08:50,182 --> 01:08:52,743
and you have not looked like a savage.

1047

01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:57,663
And when Katsumi-san
told me how gently you'd kissed her,

1048

01:08:57,742 --> 01:08:59,902
the day she became a bride,

1049

01:09:00,823 --> 01:09:04,223
how tenderly you kissed
my sweet little friend,

1050

01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:09,064
I realized the hate was of my own making.

1051

01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:13,304
That is why I came

1052

01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:16,064
to ask you to forgive me

1053

01:09:16,144 --> 01:09:18,263
for what I have been feeling.

1054

01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,704
Gruver-san, will you forgive me?

1055

01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:30,185
Well, you make me feel
like an awful fool, Miss Ogi.

1056

01:09:33,104 --> 01:09:35,385
I really feel that I ought to

1057

01:09:35,984 --> 01:09:39,185
ask you to forgive me
for some of the things that...

1058

01:09:40,105 --> 01:09:41,745
I've been thinking.

1059

01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:47,345
I come from the north of Japan.

1060

01:09:47,905 --> 01:09:50,066
And my father was a farmer,

1061

01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:52,345
and there were nine children.

1062

01:09:52,946 --> 01:09:54,785
And we were very poor.

1063

01:09:55,745 --> 01:09:58,746
There are too many people
in my crowded country.

1064

01:09:59,706 --> 01:10:02,466
I took the examination at Matsubayashi

1065

01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:05,586
and now I am first dancer of all.

1066

01:10:07,226 --> 01:10:09,547
When I am too old to dance,

1067

01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:11,626
I will become head teacher.

1068

01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:15,787
My life is planned.

1069

01:10:16,867 --> 01:10:19,227
I am dedicated to Matsubayashi

1070

01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:23,147
as you are dedicated
to American military life.

1071

01:10:26,507 --> 01:10:28,468
I have never been in love.

1072

01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:31,827
But I have dreamed

1073

01:10:32,507 --> 01:10:34,387
and thought about it,

1074

01:10:35,468 --> 01:10:36,788
and waited.

1075

01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,548
The danger that lies ahead of us,

1076

01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,708
we must face now.

1077

01:10:46,829 --> 01:10:49,549
The danger of discovery for both of us,

1078

01:10:51,629 --> 01:10:53,308
danger of weakness

1079

01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:56,188
when it is over.

1080

01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:05,070
I will never fall in love again.

1081

01:11:07,589 --> 01:11:09,710
But I will love you, Ace-san,

1082

01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:12,870
if that is your desire.

1083

01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:55,072
-Hello, how do you do?
-How do you do?

1084

01:11:58,912 --> 01:12:00,233
Ah, Miss Webster.

1085

01:12:00,712 --> 01:12:01,792
Oh, hello.

1086

01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,632
Oh, Mr. Nakamura,
how nice of you to come.

1087

01:12:05,713 --> 01:12:06,913
It is a great pleasure.

1088

01:12:06,992 --> 01:12:09,432
And may I say that
you look especially beautiful today?

1089

01:12:09,473 --> 01:12:10,753
Thank you.

1090

01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,593
I haven't been to see
this month's Kabuki program.

1091

01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:15,193
I know. You see,
I have been waiting.

1092

01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:16,513
Eileen.

1093

01:12:16,954 --> 01:12:18,793
- Eileen.
- Oh, Mother, you remember Mr. Nakamura.

1094

01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:19,873
How do you do,
Mrs. Webster?

1095

01:12:19,954 --> 01:12:22,233
Oh, yes, of course.
Now, listen, you two,

1096

01:12:22,314 --> 01:12:24,074
this party isn't
given especially for you.

1097

01:12:24,154 --> 01:12:25,753
You've got to
circulate around

1098

01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:27,953
and do more to cement
Japanese-American relations.

1099

01:12:27,994 --> 01:12:31,154
Mother, that's exactly
what Mr. Nakamura and I are doing.

1100

01:12:31,194 --> 01:12:33,434
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, Nakamura-san,

1101

01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:35,514
my little girl
wants your autograph.

1102

01:12:35,554 --> 01:12:36,794
She admires you so.

1103

01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:38,234
Of course.

1104

01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:39,514
Will you please
excuse me?

1105

01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:40,915
-Yes, of course.
-Certainly.

1106

01:12:43,515 --> 01:12:44,954
Has Lloyd come yet?

1107

01:12:45,435 --> 01:12:48,475
Oh, Mother, how many
weeks are you going to keep on pretending?

1108

01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:50,315
Lloyd is not coming.

1109

01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:52,795
I'm absolutely furious at him.

1110

01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:54,635
How can he ignore
the General's invitation?

1111

01:12:54,715 --> 01:12:56,876
I had it delivered
personally to his office.

1112

01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,115
I'm stuck with that
Farrington woman. Can you help me out?

1113

01:13:02,596 --> 01:13:04,316
Uh-oh. There's Crawford.

1114

01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:06,516
Whenever he shows up,
there's always something.

1115

01:13:07,636 --> 01:13:09,196
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute, General?

1116

01:13:09,276 --> 01:13:10,476
Certainly, Colonel.

1117

01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:12,876
- Major, do you have that list of the...
-Yes, ma'am.

1118

01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:15,716
I want to see if
the Williams have come yet...

1119

01:13:15,797 --> 01:13:16,877
Yes, they have.

1120

01:13:18,917 --> 01:13:20,076
Oh, waiter.

1121

01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:26,957
The reason I took
this up with you personally, General,

1122

01:13:27,037 --> 01:13:29,477
is because
it concerns Major Gruver.

1123

01:13:29,557 --> 01:13:31,838
Now, we think
he's hooked on to a Japanese dame.

1124

01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:33,117
Shh! Colonel!

1125

01:13:33,157 --> 01:13:35,678
Well, I'm sorry, General,
but this thing's gotten me all riled up.

1126

01:13:35,717 --> 01:13:37,158
Do you realize what it will mean

1127

01:13:37,237 --> 01:13:38,717
to the enlisted men in this area

1128

01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:41,798
if they find out that their big hero,
Ace Gruver, is out with some...

1129

01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:44,638
I've known
Major Gruver all his life.

1130

01:13:44,718 --> 01:13:47,598
I'm a close friend of his father's.
I assure you must be wrong.

1131

01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,638
He was seen going
into that house.

1132

01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:52,799
Now, my men have been
watching a troublemaker named Kelly.

1133

01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:54,879
He shacked up with
another native girl...

1134

01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:56,199
"Shacked up," Colonel?

1135

01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:59,279
Kelly's married to a Japanese girl.
Major Gruver was the best man.

1136

01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:01,599
Seems quite natural
to me that he'd visit them.

1137

01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,559
All right.
How am I going to handle the situation?

1138

01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,680
Well, don't handle it.
I trust Major Gruver implicitly.

1139

01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:10,439
Well, General, is it all right with you
if I post an order

1140

01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,120
to keep these
officers from being seen

1141

01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:15,359
with indigenous personnel?

1142

01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,320
Then if they are seen,
there's something we can do about it.

1143

01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,599
All right.
All right.

1144

01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:43,321
Lloyd.

1145

01:14:57,002 --> 01:14:58,482
Look at you, Hana.

1146

01:15:04,642 --> 01:15:06,402
No one saw you come?

1147

01:15:07,242 --> 01:15:10,482
No, there's no military
personnel around here,

1148

01:15:10,563 --> 01:15:11,842
except me.

1149

01:15:13,963 --> 01:15:15,523
We must go to the tea ceremony.

1150

01:15:15,563 --> 01:15:16,923
Yeah, I know.

1151

01:15:16,963 --> 01:15:18,043
I know.

1152

01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:20,403
Good afternoon.

1153

01:15:26,163 --> 01:15:28,644
This getting up
and down likely to kill me.

1154

01:16:00,766 --> 01:16:03,005
You make such
a production of everything.

1155

01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:08,406
The pleasure does not
lie in the end itself.

1156

01:16:08,886 --> 01:16:11,645
It's the pleasure of
all steps to that end.

1157

01:16:11,686 --> 01:16:12,846
Oh, I see.

1158

01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,048
That you, Ace?

1159

01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:43,248
Yeah, Kelly.

1160

01:16:44,248 --> 01:16:45,407
Come on in here.

1161

01:16:46,128 --> 01:16:47,768
I can't right now.

1162

01:16:49,288 --> 01:16:51,848
He'd be surprised
you come in this way.

1163

01:16:52,088 --> 01:16:53,448
He'd faint.

1164

01:16:54,488 --> 01:16:56,448
Just a little
lower, little lower, Katsumi.

1165

01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:58,408
- You always seem to be a little above it.
-Oh?

1166

01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,489
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1167

01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:00,528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1168

01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:13,489
Kelly-san, now you get in tub?

1169

01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:14,970
Okay, all right.

1170

01:17:16,689 --> 01:17:18,609
Is Hana-ogi
coming over tonight?

1171

01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:20,929
Yeah, if she can get away.

1172

01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,570
We're going to cook up
some fine Saint Louis goulash

1173

01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:25,450
with a little Memphis
greens in there.

1174

01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,210
What are you doing
tonight after dinner

1175

01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:34,290
when Hana-ogi goes
back to the theater?

1176

01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:36,251
Nothing.

1177

01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,770
How about playing poker
with Katsumi and me?

1178

01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:41,531
Oh, I'll be delighted
to take your money and your pants.

1179

01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,371
This is the life,
ain't it, Ace?

1180

01:18:24,053 --> 01:18:25,493
There you are.

1181

01:18:31,094 --> 01:18:32,533
How do you do?

1182

01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,054
Listen, I got
one word for you.

1183

01:18:47,814 --> 01:18:49,094
What is that?

1184

01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:50,774
- Food.
-Oh.

1185

01:19:02,735 --> 01:19:06,496
Sayonara

1186

01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,256
Japanese goodbye

1187

01:19:11,735 --> 01:19:16,255
Whisper sayonara

1188

01:19:16,616 --> 01:19:20,256
Lover, don't you cry

1189

01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:26,136
No more we stop to see

1190

01:19:26,497 --> 01:19:29,976
Pretty cherry blossom

1191

01:19:31,216 --> 01:19:35,617
No more we beneath the tree

1192

01:19:36,136 --> 01:19:39,417
Looking at the sky

1193

01:19:40,737 --> 01:19:44,977
Sayonara

1194

01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:50,098
Sayonara

1195

01:19:50,658 --> 01:19:55,458
Goodbye

1196

01:19:58,578 --> 01:20:01,338
That's the cutest
thing I ever saw, honey.

1197

01:20:01,418 --> 01:20:02,738
I must go.

1198

01:20:06,419 --> 01:20:07,458
Good eating.

1199

01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:10,539
Bye-bye.

1200

01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:12,819
Are you going back
to the officer's quarters tonight?

1201

01:20:13,779 --> 01:20:16,739
No, I think I'm going
to just fool around here.

1202

01:20:17,139 --> 01:20:18,739
What will you
do all evening?

1203

01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:21,380
What am I going to do?
I'm going to get some beer,

1204

01:20:21,459 --> 01:20:22,939
some pretzels,
and some girls up here.

1205

01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,619
I'm going to have
a little fun for a change.

1206

01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,619
Good.

1207

01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,500
I don't like
you to be lonely.

1208

01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,340
Take care.

1209

01:20:59,181 --> 01:21:00,582
Come on in, Katsumi.

1210

01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:08,021
I'm sorry,
Lloyd, I had to come. It's important.

1211

01:21:08,742 --> 01:21:10,221
Hello, Eileen.

1212

01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,742
How are you?

1213

01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,662
Listen, sit down,
will you?

1214

01:21:19,182 --> 01:21:21,342
Take this stuff
out of there, just getting a little...

1215

01:21:30,743 --> 01:21:32,463
Go on, sit down here.

1216

01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,943
How are you?

1217

01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:47,944
They're after you, Lloyd.

1218

01:21:48,024 --> 01:21:49,424
Who's after me?

1219

01:21:50,064 --> 01:21:53,304
There's a colonel.
His name's Crawford.

1220

01:21:53,904 --> 01:21:55,824
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1221

01:21:57,264 --> 01:21:58,585
I know him.

1222

01:21:59,425 --> 01:22:01,664
He's the one that's riding Kelly.
This is Kelly's house.

1223

01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:04,345
Yes. Yes, I know.

1224

01:22:06,985 --> 01:22:08,185
You want to hear this,
don't you, Lloyd?

1225

01:22:08,265 --> 01:22:10,785
Yeah. Sure, I want to.
Of course I do.

1226

01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:13,265
I overheard
Colonel Crawford say

1227

01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:15,466
that he's been having
this house watched,

1228

01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:20,826
hoping to catch Kelly
at something irregular, I suppose.

1229

01:22:22,266 --> 01:22:24,066
Anyhow, that's how
I knew where it was.

1230

01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:27,066
Well, then they...

1231

01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:30,146
They seen me coming
in and out of here.

1232

01:22:30,226 --> 01:22:31,426
Yes.

1233

01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:36,827
I just felt that
I had to tell you.

1234

01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:43,387
Eileen, uh...

1235

01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,707
There's something that I feel that...

1236

01:22:47,747 --> 01:22:49,067
I must go, Lloyd.

1237

01:22:49,147 --> 01:22:53,188
I just wanted to warn
you to be particularly careful about...

1238

01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:56,988
About what, honey?

1239

01:22:59,947 --> 01:23:03,028
About sticking strictly
to military regulations.

1240

01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:08,028
Oh, Lloyd, they'll do
anything to hang something on you, to...

1241

01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:09,789
To keep you in line.

1242

01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:15,109
After all, you're
the Air Force's pinup boy, you know.

1243

01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:21,349
Colonel Crawford sounded
as if he was after blood.

1244

01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:28,349
You know, more than
anything else I could think of, I...

1245

01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,949
I must
go now, Lloyd. Good luck.

1246

01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:35,230
Wait a minute,
let me help you off...

1247

01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:39,709
Eileen, I know...

1248

01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,030
Lloyd.

1249

01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:42,470
Lloyd, you've really
thought seriously

1250

01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:43,910
about what you're
doing, haven't you?

1251

01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:50,071
Oh, yes.

1252

01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,510
I think I have.

1253

01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:54,790
Oh, I hope so.

1254

01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:58,711
You have a brilliant
record in the Air Force.

1255

01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:01,351
More people depend
upon you than you'll ever know.

1256

01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:05,631
Before you throw all that
you've worked for away, Lloyd, be sure.

1257

01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:07,232
Please, be sure.

1258

01:24:10,552 --> 01:24:14,831
Eileen, l don’t think
if I had a million years,

1259

01:24:14,912 --> 01:24:16,672
I could tell you
how all this happened.

1260

01:24:20,112 --> 01:24:22,432
I'd better go before
I lose all my charm.

1261

01:24:50,714 --> 01:24:53,794
Do you like this old,
curious play?

1262

01:24:55,194 --> 01:24:57,514
Yeah, I'm beginning
to get a kick out of it.

1263

01:25:04,674 --> 01:25:06,355
See the rope
between the rocks?

1264

01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:07,875
Yeah.

1265

01:25:07,955 --> 01:25:10,914
That is a Shinto sign
showing they are married.

1266

01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,595
What, the rocks?

1267

01:25:12,675 --> 01:25:15,115
Yes.
They've been together so long,

1268

01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:17,435
our people thought
it was time they should get married.

1269

01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,076
They look well
together, don't you think?

1270

01:25:20,155 --> 01:25:22,595
Yeah, they make
a handsome-looking couple.

1271

01:25:23,236 --> 01:25:25,075
Do you like my country?

1272

01:25:25,156 --> 01:25:27,556
Yeah. Was all these...
All these funny things here before

1273

01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:29,035
when I came to Japan?

1274

01:25:29,116 --> 01:25:30,276
Yes.

1275

01:25:40,517 --> 01:25:41,636
Well, hello.

1276

01:25:41,717 --> 01:25:43,716
Hello there, Double Ugly.
How are you?

1277

01:25:43,757 --> 01:25:45,756
To what do we
owe the honor of this visit?

1278

01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:50,437
Laundry. Gonna put down
the dirties and pick up the cleans.

1279

01:25:54,437 --> 01:25:56,477
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1280

01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,517
This came in
the office this morning.

1281

01:25:58,598 --> 01:25:59,637
Thought you might
like to see it.

1282

01:26:00,157 --> 01:26:03,477
"This is a routine reminder
of the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe."

1283

01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:06,798
Quote, "Any public display,
whatever, of affection

1284

01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,238
"for a Japanese national
by a member of this command is forbidden.

1285

01:26:10,278 --> 01:26:12,998
"Officers should not even
appear on public streets

1286

01:26:13,078 --> 01:26:16,358
"accompanied by indigenous
female personnel." Unquote.

1287

01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:17,519
Hooray for Christmas.

1288

01:26:17,878 --> 01:26:20,239
Come on, Ace, this is
serious. Everybody got one of these things.

1289

01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:24,158
Oh, listen, fool, Hana-ogi and I are
just as careful as we can be.

1290

01:26:24,438 --> 01:26:27,479
We never go anyplace where we're gonna be
seen by anybody that matters.

1291

01:26:27,879 --> 01:26:30,279
We don't even walk
down the same street.

1292

01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,479
We just go out
in the country and fool around.

1293

01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,919
See, listen, you never been to the
country around here, have you?

1294

01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:41,080
Awful pretty country around here.
I mean it.

1295

01:26:41,999 --> 01:26:43,560
You know what
I saw yesterday?

1296

01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:46,120
I saw two rocks
that just got married.

1297

01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,520
You what?

1298

01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,640
I saw two rocks
that got married.

1299

01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,400
And they looked very
happy together, too.

1300

01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,000
Oh, I'll bet they did.

1301

01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,400
Oh, they did.

1302

01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:58,241
If you gonna be smart,
I'll tell you what you do.

1303

01:26:58,801 --> 01:27:01,040
You get your little shoes shined,
you go out tonight,

1304

01:27:01,121 --> 01:27:03,520
'cause tonight is
gonna be Tanabata.

1305

01:27:04,841 --> 01:27:06,761
Okay, what's Tanabata?

1306

01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,921
You mean you're gonna
sit there with your bare face hanging out

1307

01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:11,561
and tell me
you don't know what Tanabata is?

1308

01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:12,601
Yeah.

1309

01:27:13,281 --> 01:27:14,882
Well, my word, boy.

1310

01:27:14,921 --> 01:27:17,801
I'm ashamed of you. I thought
everybody knew what Tanabata was.

1311

01:27:18,282 --> 01:27:20,681
Tanabata is
the night of love.

1312

01:27:20,882 --> 01:27:23,242
You told me
all about it one time.

1313

01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:25,242
You were telling me
about Harry Truman

1314

01:27:25,322 --> 01:27:27,482
and New York Yankees
and sex

1315

01:27:28,603 --> 01:27:30,962
and New York Yankees
and Harry Truman and sex.

1316

01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:32,522
And I'll see you...

1317

01:27:35,882 --> 01:27:36,842
Sex!

1318

01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:52,643
What have I done
to deserve such happiness?

1319

01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:56,844
I have seen this night of
Tanabata come and go many times,

1320

01:27:58,844 --> 01:28:02,484
but never before
have I understood what it meant.

1321

01:28:03,884 --> 01:28:05,364
Tanabata.

1322

01:28:06,524 --> 01:28:09,524
Oh, my heart is so
full of love for you.

1323

01:28:51,687 --> 01:28:53,487
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?

1324

01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:55,927
Nakamura-san gets your note.

1325

01:28:56,007 --> 01:28:57,206
Here is reply.

1326

01:28:57,287 --> 01:28:58,247
Thank you.

1327

01:28:58,287 --> 01:29:01,687
He wishes if you will have
dinner with him and his guests.

1328

01:29:01,767 --> 01:29:03,207
Thank you very much.

1329

01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:36,929
They have a rather
pleasant garden here, Miss Webster.

1330

01:29:38,769 --> 01:29:39,729
Would you like to see it?

1331

01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:42,009
Yes, I think I would.

1332

01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,091
How beautiful.

1333

01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:18,772
What are you
really afraid of, Miss Webster?

1334

01:30:18,851 --> 01:30:21,211
You don't think
it would enter Major Gruver's mind

1335

01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,211
to marry a Japanese girl?

1336

01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:27,412
I don't know.

1337

01:30:28,252 --> 01:30:30,572
Then permit me
to reassure you.

1338

01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,972
I think Major Gruver
is brave

1339

01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:36,252
but not brave enough
to face the censure

1340

01:30:36,332 --> 01:30:38,772
that would result
from such a marriage.

1341

01:30:39,132 --> 01:30:42,452
As for our famous,
honored Hana-ogi,

1342

01:30:43,132 --> 01:30:45,373
there are many Japanese,

1343

01:30:45,452 --> 01:30:46,773
most of them, in fact,

1344

01:30:47,253 --> 01:30:50,813
who look upon marriage
to an occidental with as much distaste

1345

01:30:50,893 --> 01:30:53,693
as your people do
to one of us.

1346

01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:56,853
I do not feel that way.

1347

01:30:57,253 --> 01:30:58,893
But, then,
I have had the privilege

1348

01:30:58,933 --> 01:31:00,734
of traveling
in your country

1349

01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:03,533
and knowing some
great people there.

1350

01:31:04,373 --> 01:31:08,494
And I am especially
conscious at this moment

1351

01:31:08,534 --> 01:31:12,295
that beauty
is not confined to any one race.

1352

01:31:16,614 --> 01:31:18,735
Do not turn away,
Miss Webster.

1353

01:31:19,054 --> 01:31:23,974
I am not necessarily
making love to you.

1354

01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:28,935
I am only stating a very

1355

01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:31,975
obvious fact.

1356

01:31:34,015 --> 01:31:36,215
May I see you again,
Miss Webster,

1357

01:31:36,816 --> 01:31:40,216
and acquaint you
with more Japan?

1358

01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,816
Of course.

1359

01:31:43,256 --> 01:31:45,296
I need to know more,
much more,

1360

01:31:46,576 --> 01:31:47,896
about everything.

1361

01:32:07,817 --> 01:32:09,657
There she is.

1362

01:32:11,617 --> 01:32:13,138
Hello, honey.

1363

01:32:25,178 --> 01:32:26,538
Are you tired?

1364

01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:32,659
No, TIM...
TIM been lying here

1365

01:32:32,698 --> 01:32:34,458
thinking about myself.

1366

01:32:35,259 --> 01:32:37,139
You know,
I can't believe I'm really here.

1367

01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:40,459
It's hard to believe that...

1368

01:32:40,539 --> 01:32:43,899
You know, it's hard
to believe me being the same Lloyd Gruver

1369

01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:46,619
that came over from Korea
just a little bit ago.

1370

01:32:49,619 --> 01:32:51,020
You know, I been thinking

1371

01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,180
that all my life

1372

01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:55,340
I been so busy

1373

01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:59,340
snapping to,
and giving orders, and taking orders,

1374

01:32:59,419 --> 01:33:02,620
and being a general’s son,
and doing the job

1375

01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:07,741
and all that,
I just never took time to sit right down

1376

01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:13,501
and, you know, think about
what my reason for living is.

1377

01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:19,181
And I been spending
some afternoons here just

1378

01:33:20,421 --> 01:33:21,981
being peaceful

1379

01:33:23,101 --> 01:33:24,981
and easy and thinking.

1380

01:33:27,382 --> 01:33:29,662
And I believe
for the first time,

1381

01:33:31,902 --> 01:33:35,822
I'm just beginning
to understand

1382

01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:37,582
what it's all about,

1383

01:33:39,182 --> 01:33:41,342
what I really am,
what I really want.

1384

01:33:42,863 --> 01:33:44,342
It's a nice feeling.

1385

01:33:53,823 --> 01:33:55,102
Yeah, come on in.

1386

01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,823
Ace, excuse me.
I hate to bother you.

1387

01:33:58,903 --> 01:34:00,543
TIM got the news.

1388
01:34:00,623 --> 01:34:01,983
You got what news?

1389

01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,503
I'm getting shipped back.

1390

01:34:04,784 --> 01:34:06,184
You being shipped
back where?

1391

01:34:06,584 --> 01:34:07,863
Stateside.

1392

01:34:08,224 --> 01:34:09,984
I've been reassigned
to a new duty station.

1393

01:34:10,743 --> 01:34:13,184
Well...

1394

01:34:14,864 --> 01:34:16,264
Did you tell Katsumi yet?

1395

01:34:16,344 --> 01:34:17,424
No.

1396

01:34:17,504 --> 01:34:19,944
All right. Well, don't tell her, because
maybe we can work something out.

1397

01:34:20,384 --> 01:34:22,785
What reason did
he give you for it?

1398

01:34:23,465 --> 01:34:26,065
No reason.
I know what it is.

1399

01:34:26,944 --> 01:34:29,865
Every guy on that list
is married to a Japanese girl.

1400

01:34:34,865 --> 01:34:37,665
I'm sorry, Major.
There's nothing you can do.

1401

01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:44,186
We're sending Kelly
to the States Thursday, and that's that.

1402

01:34:46,906 --> 01:34:48,585
Well, what about
his wife, Colonel?

1403

01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:50,906
Well, she stays here.

1404

01:34:52,466 --> 01:34:54,946
He knew he couldn't take her back with
him when he married her.

1405

01:34:54,986 --> 01:34:55,946
Mmm-hmm.

1406

01:34:56,387 --> 01:34:57,506
Didn't you?

1407

01:34:57,586 --> 01:34:58,746
That's right.

1408

01:35:00,386 --> 01:35:02,387
Well, you'd be busting up
his home then, you know.

1409

01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,467
I'm not busting up anything.

1410

01:35:06,627 --> 01:35:10,827
Oh, I admit Kelly's
been a pain in my side for quite a while now.

1411

01:35:10,947 --> 01:35:12,307
Well, could you tell me

1412

01:35:12,387 --> 01:35:15,347
why he didn't have
the privilege of extending his tour of duty?

1413

01:35:15,427 --> 01:35:16,867
Don't ask me, Major.

1414

01:35:17,427 --> 01:35:19,708
There are lots of reasons
for these things.

1415

01:35:20,788 --> 01:35:23,228
Anyway, it is an order.

1416

01:35:23,748 --> 01:35:25,347
And there's nothing
you can do about it

1417

01:35:26,348 --> 01:35:28,388
even if you are
a four-star general’s son.

1418

01:35:30,268 --> 01:35:31,428
Yeah, well...

1419

01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:37,509
Would it make any difference
if I told you my wife's going to have a baby?

1420

01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:42,749
Well, that's tough,
I admit.

1421

01:35:45,589 --> 01:35:46,869
Colonel, under these circumstances,

1422

01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:49,029
don't you think
that you'd be able to

1423

01:35:49,829 --> 01:35:51,909
postpone this
for a little while?

1424

01:35:52,709 --> 01:35:54,709
Maybe I could be
transferred back to Korea.

1425

01:35:55,789 --> 01:35:57,589
No, you're going home.

1426

01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,509
All the boys
on this list, going home.

1427

01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:05,350
Where is your home?

1428

01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:07,830
That house by the canal.

1429

01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,230
I mean your real home.

1430

01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,070
That house by the canal.

1431

01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,670
Yeah, all right.

1432

01:36:15,911 --> 01:36:19,231
I've taken all the insubordination
from you I intend to.

1433

01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:22,471
Now, you listen
to me, wise guy,

1434

01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:27,111
that house by the canal
is off-limits from now on.

1435

01:36:28,832 --> 01:36:30,711
Whole street's off-limits.

1436

01:36:31,432 --> 01:36:32,751
You want a court-martial?

1437

01:36:34,272 --> 01:36:35,792
That mean I could
stay in Japan?

1438

01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:36,872
Come on, Kel.

1439

01:36:36,912 --> 01:36:38,232
You're shipping out
of here on Thursday.

1440

01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:39,792
And don't you
try to help him.

1441

01:36:42,872 --> 01:36:44,872
You remember that
house by the canal

1442

01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:47,592
is off-limits to all personnel.

1443

01:36:49,752 --> 01:36:51,352
Would you tell me,
Colonel, just exactly

1444

01:36:51,433 --> 01:36:53,513
what you mean
by that last remark?

1445

01:36:53,873 --> 01:36:56,073
Well, that's all
I'm prepared to say at the minute,

1446

01:36:57,112 --> 01:36:58,233
except you watch your step.

1447

01:37:04,393 --> 01:37:07,073
So, I don't know
what else to say to you, General.

1448

01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,553
I've known this boy
a long time,

1449

01:37:08,594 --> 01:37:11,354
and if he has to go back without
Katsumi, he's gonna be in trouble.

1450

01:37:11,953 --> 01:37:12,913
And...

1451

01:37:13,433 --> 01:37:15,434
Well, I mean,
that's about it. That's it.

1452

01:37:16,074 --> 01:37:17,273
What about his wife?

1453

01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,794
-I don't know.
- And the baby?

1454

01:37:22,234 --> 01:37:24,795
So it comes down to
the fact that the Army lets them get married

1455

01:37:24,874 --> 01:37:26,634
and then forces
them to desert their wives and babies.

1456

01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:29,035
That's not fair, Eileen.

1457

01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:33,194
A boy away from home
for the first time, lonesome,

1458

01:37:33,275 --> 01:37:35,755
often falls in love
with the first girl he touches.

1459

01:37:35,835 --> 01:37:37,834
In most cases,
with a girl from the streets.

1460

01:37:38,995 --> 01:37:40,675
It's up to the service
in some measure

1461

01:37:40,715 --> 01:37:42,835
to be fathers
and mothers to these boys

1462

01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:47,435
and try to head off
these marriages.

1463

01:37:47,836 --> 01:37:50,235
But after they're married
why should they be sent home?

1464

01:37:50,315 --> 01:37:52,996
The man's being transferred
to a new duty station, Eileen,

1465

01:37:53,036 --> 01:37:54,155
along with many others.

1466

01:37:54,196 --> 01:37:56,716
Now, don't ask me
the reasons for changes of duty.

1467

01:37:57,156 --> 01:37:58,636
There are thousands of them.

1468

01:37:58,716 --> 01:38:01,036
But Lloyd said
that most of the men on this particular list

1469

01:38:01,076 --> 01:38:02,637
are married to Japanese girls.

1470

01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:04,236
That can't be just
a coincidence, Father.

1471

01:38:04,316 --> 01:38:05,517
Why not?
It could easily be.

1472

01:38:05,596 --> 01:38:07,596
There have been
lots of marriages.

1473

01:38:07,677 --> 01:38:09,796
Frankly, with some
of these men,

1474

01:38:10,076 --> 01:38:12,717
I think they might
welcome the transfer.

1475

01:38:13,157 --> 01:38:14,437
Why is that, sir?

1476

01:38:14,996 --> 01:38:18,437
There have been unfortunate
aftermaths to many of these marriages.

1477

01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:20,397
Recriminations, regrets.

1478

01:38:22,118 --> 01:38:24,397
A boy gets married
impulsively, then feels caught,

1479

01:38:24,477 --> 01:38:26,677
doesn't know how to get out of
it, doesn't know what to do.

1480

01:38:26,758 --> 01:38:29,198
Change of duty
gives them both a chance to think it over.

1481

01:38:29,277 --> 01:38:30,397
To cool off.

1482

01:38:31,597 --> 01:38:33,558
Now, I don't mean to
imply that that's the reason

1483

01:38:33,638 --> 01:38:35,718
these men are being
transferred, but...

1484

01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:37,358
Well...

1485

01:38:38,918 --> 01:38:40,479
The whole thing's

1486

01:38:41,398 --> 01:38:42,718
a messy business.

1487

01:38:44,278 --> 01:38:47,759
General Webster, there is no regret in the
case of Kelly and Katsumi.

1488

01:38:48,799 --> 01:38:50,639
You can have
my word on that.

1489

01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:51,999
Lloyd,

1490

01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:54,959
three officers
came to me today

1491

01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:56,999
with identical requests
for their men.

1492

01:38:57,479 --> 01:38:59,199
It's not our policy
to interfere with decisions

1493

01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,439
made by immediate
commanding officers.

1494

01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:04,040
The basic structure
of the whole military service would collapse

1495

01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,919
if we started doing
things like that.

1496

01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:09,440
Your father would
understand that, even if you don't.

1497

01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:13,200
Are you going to
ask me to make an exception of Kelly

1498

01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,800
when I've refused
these other men?

1499

01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,241
I am going to ask you
to do that, sir.

1500

01:39:22,161 --> 01:39:24,840
You made an exception of me
when you brought me from Korea.

1501

01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:30,601
I'm afraid
it's a hopeless situation, Lloyd.

1502

01:39:35,841 --> 01:39:36,801
Well...

1503

01:39:39,081 --> 01:39:40,842
That's the end of Joe Kelly.

1504

01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:45,401
You told me yourself
that Kelly's past record was against him.

1505

01:39:45,482 --> 01:39:47,202
I couldn't even use that,
don't you see?

1506

01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:49,642
Why does this mean
so much to you, Lloyd?

1507

01:39:52,242 --> 01:39:55,802
Kelly's from my outfit, Mrs. Webster.
I was his best man.

1508

01:39:56,402 --> 01:39:59,043
And I'm planning to marry
a Japanese girl myself.

1509

01:40:03,683 --> 01:40:05,682
Come into the other room, Eileen.

1510

01:40:05,763 --> 01:40:07,803
This is something
for your father to handle.

1511

01:40:08,523 --> 01:40:12,083
No, Mrs. Webster, I don't think it's
anything for anybody to handle.

1512

01:40:18,323 --> 01:40:19,683
I'm sorry, Eileen.

1513

01:40:24,764 --> 01:40:25,964
Mrs. Webster.

1514

01:40:26,564 --> 01:40:28,004
Good afternoon, y'all.

1515

01:40:34,165 --> 01:40:37,845
I don't think I'll ever love anyone
again as much as I love Lloyd.

1516

01:40:39,164 --> 01:40:41,204
But I'll tell you something
that's rather ironic.

1517

01:40:42,844 --> 01:40:45,805
I once asked Lloyd
if he ever felt like grabbing me

1518

01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,445
and hauling me off
to a shack somewhere.

1519

01:40:50,325 --> 01:40:52,006
That's just what
he's done, isn't it?

1520

01:40:52,805 --> 01:40:54,165
Only it's with somebody else.

1521

01:40:55,365 --> 01:40:57,206
Don't go out, Eileen.

1522

01:40:57,245 --> 01:40:58,365
Stay and talk.

1523

01:40:58,446 --> 01:40:59,766
I'm sorry, Mother.

1524

01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:02,166
There's only one person
I'd like to talk to at the moment,

1525

01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:04,726
and oddly enough,
he's Japanese.

1526

01:41:09,366 --> 01:41:10,966
Ace, I've been
waiting for you.

1527

01:41:11,046 --> 01:41:12,406
Hey, Kelly, listen.

1528

01:41:12,847 --> 01:41:15,806
I just came from
General Webster's house

1529

01:41:15,887 --> 01:41:17,367
and there's a whole
big mess there.

1530

01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:18,646
-No good, huh?
- No.

1531

01:41:19,127 --> 01:41:21,526
He didn't...
He didn't go for it.

1532

01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:24,887
Matter of fact,
I think I even messed it up a little.

1533

01:41:26,527 --> 01:41:27,967
That figures.

1534

01:41:28,727 --> 01:41:30,247
Did you tell
Katsumi yet?

1535

01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:31,327
No.

1536

01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:33,727
I'm chickening out fast.

1537

01:41:34,607 --> 01:41:37,648
Besides, she's got her heart set on
something she planned for us tonight.

1538

01:41:38,088 --> 01:41:39,728
Wants us both to take
the train to Osaka

1539

01:41:39,767 --> 01:41:41,848
and meet the girls
at the puppet show.

1540

01:41:43,448 --> 01:41:44,689
Why Spoil it?

1541

01:41:47,168 --> 01:41:49,408
Maybe I'll tell
her late tonight when we're alone.

1542

01:41:52,369 --> 01:41:55,329
Kelly, don't give up on it.
I think there's gonna be a way out of it.

1543

01:41:55,408 --> 01:41:56,368
- There's got to be.
- You think so?

1544

01:41:56,409 --> 01:41:57,728
- Yes, I do.
-I don't.

1545

01:42:00,089 --> 01:42:01,369
- I'll see you, Ace.
- Hi, hon.

1546

01:42:01,409 --> 01:42:02,369
Kelly-san.

1547

01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:06,129
Hey, tell Katsumi
we'll be there with bells.

1548

01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:09,210
Were you able to help?

1549

01:42:12,689 --> 01:42:14,250
No. I wasn't.

1550

01:42:14,329 --> 01:42:15,770
How terrible.

1551

01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,050
I know this is hard, honey.

1552

01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:23,290
It's hard,
but it's not gonna last long.

1553

01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:26,931
I mean, the Army's got to change that
law next year or the next one.

1554

01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:30,771
I mean, it just has to be.
I'm sure of it.

1555

01:42:32,691 --> 01:42:34,651
And, as a matter of fact,

1556

01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:37,331
I'm so sure of it
that I went downtown today

1557

01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:39,931
and I signed
some papers here

1558

01:42:39,971 --> 01:42:42,211
that mean that you and I
are gonna get married.

1559

01:42:45,172 --> 01:42:46,291
What's the matter?

1560

01:42:46,331 --> 01:42:47,931
We never spoke of marriage.

1561

01:42:48,812 --> 01:42:50,772
I know we didn't, darling.

1562

01:42:51,651 --> 01:42:55,852
I know we didn't.
I been going round and round with that

1563

01:42:55,932 --> 01:42:57,852
every day for a long time.

1564

01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:01,893
And I didn't feel I could
speak about it until now.

1565

01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:04,572
Now I can.

1566

01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:09,732
Now, of course,
I won't be able to take you back to America,

1567

01:43:09,813 --> 01:43:12,413
but they're bound to change
that ridiculous law soon.

1568

01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:16,253
And until then,
I'm gonna stay here with you.

1569

01:43:18,494 --> 01:43:21,453
I'm not stuck in the Air Force.
I can resign.

1570

01:43:21,533 --> 01:43:24,573
Of course,
I'm not trained to do anything else,

1571

01:43:25,373 --> 01:43:26,454
but I'd find something.

1572

01:43:27,934 --> 01:43:29,974
We never spoke of marriage.

1573

01:43:31,454 --> 01:43:34,814
I know we didn't, darling,
but we're speaking of it now.

1574

01:43:42,134 --> 01:43:44,854
Do you remember
the first night we talked?

1575

01:43:45,534 --> 01:43:49,254
I said there would
be danger of weakness when it is over.

1576

01:43:52,415 --> 01:43:54,735
Over?
What are you talking about?

1577

01:43:58,095 --> 01:44:01,256
I am tempted.
With you, I could become a woman.

1578

01:44:02,175 --> 01:44:05,496
And a mother.
And I could love you.

1579

01:44:07,615 --> 01:44:08,976
That's right.

1580

01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:12,056
Do you think I haven't
thought about it?

1581

01:44:12,536 --> 01:44:15,456
Do you think
I want to become a lonely old woman

1582

01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:18,977
who teaches dancing,
now that I have known you?

1583

01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:22,897
But it is no good.

1584

01:44:23,976 --> 01:44:25,257
You must know it, too.

1585

01:44:25,657 --> 01:44:28,937
No, no. I don't know
anything of the kind.

1586

01:44:30,537 --> 01:44:33,097
The way you talk about
leaving the Air Force,

1587

01:44:34,177 --> 01:44:36,658
finding some pitiful
way of earning living

1588

01:44:36,737 --> 01:44:39,177
just to be here with
your Japanese wife.

1589

01:44:39,497 --> 01:44:41,418
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1590

01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:47,657
I think we're too far
in this thing to be talking like that.

1591

01:44:49,498 --> 01:44:52,098
Matsubayashi has been
kind to me, Lloyd.

1592

01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:55,459
I am obligated to them.

1593

01:44:55,898 --> 01:44:59,458
No, you ain't.
You... No, no. You obligated to me.

1594

01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:02,498
They are my life.

1595

01:45:03,099 --> 01:45:05,859
I will bring shame
to them, disgrace.

1596

01:45:06,819 --> 01:45:08,899
Lloyd, you know
what I mean?

1597

01:45:08,979 --> 01:45:12,419
Yeah, I think
I'm beginning to know what you mean.

1598

01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:16,180
I think you mean you simply don't love me
enough to go on through with it.

1599

01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,379
That's what you mean,
don't you?

1600

01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,780
Why don't you
just come on out and say it?

1601

01:45:20,859 --> 01:45:22,660
It is not what I mean.

1602

01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:29,700
I'm leaving for Tokyo
in six days.

1603

01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:32,901
Matsubayashi are sending me.

1604

01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,620
You What?

1605

01:45:36,701 --> 01:45:40,701
With another troupe.
They have found out about us.

1606

01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:45,741
Any other girl, they would have
dismissed, but because they like me,

1607

01:45:45,821 --> 01:45:49,981
because they feel I am important
to them, they are being lenient.

1608

01:45:51,301 --> 01:45:53,661
Well, I'm not gonna be
lenient with you.

1609

01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:55,821
I want you to
tell me right now

1610

01:45:55,902 --> 01:45:58,662
why Matsubayashi
means more to you than I do?

1611

01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:04,382
Lloyd, there is something
about myself

1612

01:46:04,422 --> 01:46:05,862
I have not told you.

1613

01:46:07,222 --> 01:46:09,462
I have no right
to marry anyone.

1614

01:46:10,502 --> 01:46:12,422
My father was very poor.

1615

01:46:13,623 --> 01:46:16,103
To save his other children,

1616

01:46:16,183 --> 01:46:18,623
he was forced to sell
one of his daughters.

1617

01:46:20,263 --> 01:46:23,303
The man from the houses
of Yoshiwara came to him.

1618

01:46:24,863 --> 01:46:26,863
Because I was the oldest,

1619

01:46:28,103 --> 01:46:30,344
he agreed I should
go with them.

1620

01:46:32,223 --> 01:46:34,344
Your father sold you?

1621

01:46:35,463 --> 01:46:39,224
Yes, but I was saved
from starting this life

1622

01:46:39,784 --> 01:46:41,904
by my best friend,
Fumiko-san.

1623

01:46:44,424 --> 01:46:46,825
Her father paid
money to free me

1624

01:46:48,345 --> 01:46:50,744
and she brought me
to Matsubayashi.

1625

01:46:54,185 --> 01:46:56,905
There, I not only
earn my living,

1626

01:46:58,224 --> 01:47:00,745
I brought honor
back to my family.

1627

01:47:03,305 --> 01:47:05,665
Matsubayashi has
been kind to me.

1628

01:47:06,465 --> 01:47:08,186
They have trusted me.

1629

01:47:09,706 --> 01:47:11,306
I cannot leave them.

1630

01:47:12,306 --> 01:47:14,186
I cannot marry anyone.

1631

01:47:18,146 --> 01:47:20,186
Don't you understand?

1632

01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:27,866
I don't know.

1633

01:47:29,786 --> 01:47:30,947
I don't know
what to think.

1634

01:47:34,227 --> 01:47:35,267
I'll kill you!

1635

01:47:35,307 --> 01:47:36,707
You ever do
anything like this,

1636

01:47:36,747 --> 01:47:38,067
and I'll kill you,
you understand?

1637

01:47:38,147 --> 01:47:40,147
Get that straight, now!
I'll kill you!

1638

01:47:40,227 --> 01:47:42,307
Wait a minute. Listen.
Just take it easy, now.

1639

01:47:42,348 --> 01:47:43,707
Ace, look at this.

1640
01:47:46,348 --> 01:47:48,027
-It fell out of her bag.
- What is it?

1641

01:47:48,108 --> 01:47:49,868
She was gonna
have it done, too.

1642

01:47:49,908 --> 01:47:52,348
Tomorrow,
by that quack doctor down by the docks.

1643

01:47:52,428 --> 01:47:54,548
- What?
-For 8 bucks, she slashes her eyelids

1644

01:47:54,628 --> 01:47:56,668
and sews them
back up again.

1645

01:47:56,748 --> 01:47:58,788
Lots of these stupid little jerks
have it done.

1646

01:47:58,829 --> 01:48:00,349
She was gonna surprise me.

1647

01:48:01,029 --> 01:48:01,989
Well...

1648

01:48:02,028 --> 01:48:03,148
Then...

1649

01:48:03,229 --> 01:48:06,948
Then I have good eyes.
I fool everybody.

1650

01:48:07,309 --> 01:48:10,069
I look American, like Joe.

1651

01:48:11,149 --> 01:48:16,069
Hana-ogi, will you tell
that stupid dame I love her the way she is?

1652

01:48:16,469 --> 01:48:17,989
I don't want her changed.

1653

01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,790
Will you tell her
I love her mouth

1654

01:48:19,829 --> 01:48:22,950
and her nose
and her ears and her eyes

1655

01:48:22,989 --> 01:48:24,669
just the way they are?

1656

01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,870
Tell her if she ever does
anything like that, I'll...

1657

01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:29,830
Wait a minute.
Calm down, Kelly.

1658

01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:32,190
I want him
be proud of me.

1659

01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,390
Listen, listen. Listen.

1660

01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:35,190
I am sorry.

1661

01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:38,191
Listen, if you want him
to be proud of you, you got to quit this stuff.

1662

01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:39,630
‘Cause you want to be
a good wife, don't you?

1663

01:48:39,671 --> 01:48:41,711
You're making him
very unhappy when you're doing that.

1664

01:48:41,790 --> 01:48:43,951
Now, tell him you're sorry
and you're not going to do it anymore.

1665

01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:45,230
Tell him that.

1666

01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:46,271
Joe...

1667

01:48:48,431 --> 01:48:50,191
I so sorry.

1668

01:48:52,631 --> 01:48:55,472
Okay. Now, we're gonna
forget about that, all right?

1669

01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:57,631
Now, listen.
I came over here tonight,

1670

01:48:57,711 --> 01:48:59,272
I thought we were gonna
have a fish fry.

1671

01:48:59,312 --> 01:49:01,431
We were gonna have some fun right
here, and dancing and yelling,

1672

01:49:01,512 --> 01:49:02,752
and what do I find?

1673

01:49:02,832 --> 01:49:04,271
What's gonna happen to us?

1674

01:49:04,352 --> 01:49:05,352
Puppet show.

1675

01:49:05,391 --> 01:49:07,232
-Yeah, we had a surprise...
- You like?

1676

01:49:07,312 --> 01:49:08,952
Sure, I do.
Been looking forward to it.

1677

01:49:09,472 --> 01:49:11,792
I know everybody tonight.

1678

01:49:11,872 --> 01:49:13,033
Yeah.

1679

01:49:15,952 --> 01:49:16,912
And

1680

01:49:17,312 --> 01:49:18,672
we will be late.

1681

01:49:26,433 --> 01:49:27,433
Look.

1682

01:49:28,113 --> 01:49:32,593
The lover is leaving the city,
walk to the wood.

1683

01:50:08,675 --> 01:50:12,195
Lloyd, don't think
of anything now.

1684

01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:14,836
Watch the play.

1685

01:50:15,635 --> 01:50:17,356
It's a tender story.

1686

01:50:25,516 --> 01:50:29,116
When gong sound,
it is done.

1687

01:50:29,436 --> 01:50:34,156
And then she will
bind her body.

1688

01:50:35,677 --> 01:50:37,037
Bind her body?

1689

01:50:37,077 --> 01:50:40,237
So that she will not fall
in an ugly position

1690

01:50:40,276 --> 01:50:42,357
of dishonor when she dies.

1691

01:50:42,757 --> 01:50:43,797
- When she dies?
- Mmm.

1692

01:50:43,877 --> 01:50:45,157
Yes, shinju.

1693

01:51:02,358 --> 01:51:04,438
It is custom for lovers

1694

01:51:04,518 --> 01:51:07,718
to die together
when they can no longer face life.

1695

01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,199
It is so beautiful.

1696

01:51:21,079 --> 01:51:23,799
Beautiful?
They're gonna die, aren't they?

1697

01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,680
They will live
in another world on a beautiful lake

1698

01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:31,479
floating always together

1699

01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,880
like water lily.

1700

01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,040
Sure.

1701

01:52:56,804 --> 01:52:59,725
Kelly-san! Kelly-san!
Kelly-san!

1702

01:53:09,764 --> 01:53:11,965
Something about soldiers
going through the house.

1703

01:53:17,605 --> 01:53:18,725
That's the MPs, boy.

1704

01:53:18,806 --> 01:53:20,485
-What happened? What's wrong?
- Come here, come here.

1705

01:53:20,566 --> 01:53:22,086
- What happened?
- Get in the car.

1706

01:53:24,766 --> 01:53:25,965
Go to Matsubayashi.

1707

01:53:26,046 --> 01:53:27,806
- Please, please tell me. I will not leave.
- I will, I will.

1708

01:53:27,846 --> 01:53:29,245
Now, get in the car.
I'll tell you later.

1709

01:53:29,326 --> 01:53:30,766
Matsubayashi.

1710

01:53:33,406 --> 01:53:34,606
Hey, Ed, look.

1711

01:53:50,207 --> 01:53:51,287
Look at that.

1712

01:53:54,367 --> 01:53:55,808
You're Major Gruver,
aren't you?

1713

01:53:56,567 --> 01:53:57,567
That's right.

1714

01:53:57,647 --> 01:53:59,088
Sorry, Major, you'll have
to come with us.

1715

01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:00,287
General Webster's orders.

1716

01:54:00,448 --> 01:54:02,528
So, what right do
you have to board up this man's house?

1717

01:54:02,567 --> 01:54:04,008
He won't be needing
it anymore, Major.

1718

01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:05,128
He's shipping out Thursday.

1719

01:54:05,248 --> 01:54:06,208
Joe?

1720

01:54:07,128 --> 01:54:08,448
Come on, Major.

1721

01:54:10,528 --> 01:54:12,048
You'll hear from me, Kelly.

1722

01:54:25,929 --> 01:54:27,449
Come on, kid.

1723

01:54:27,489 --> 01:54:31,090
We'll get in through the garden.
I got something to tell you.

1724

01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:54,850
You were seen
in public with her tonight,

1725

01:54:54,891 --> 01:54:56,931
violating the orders
of the area.

1726

01:54:56,971 --> 01:54:59,090
This has given
me the right to put you under arrest.

1727

01:55:00,411 --> 01:55:02,651
And, for your own sake,
I think I'd better do it.

1728

01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:04,731
Well,

1729

01:55:05,251 --> 01:55:06,651
you have anything to say?

1730

01:55:09,052 --> 01:55:12,052
Well, just as soon I'm out of this,
I'm going to be married,

1731

01:55:12,131 --> 01:55:13,491
and have a house of my own.

1732

01:55:15,892 --> 01:55:17,372
I'm afraid not.

1733

01:55:17,812 --> 01:55:20,012
I'm sorry, Lloyd,
but it's all settled.

1734

01:55:20,092 --> 01:55:23,372
The supervisor of the Matsubayashi
came to see me tonight.

1735

01:55:23,852 --> 01:55:26,332
The girl goes
to Tokyo, and you fly to Randolph Field,

1736

01:55:26,852 --> 01:55:27,892
day after tomorrow.

1737

01:55:28,772 --> 01:55:30,252
Here are your orders.

1738

01:55:31,573 --> 01:55:33,613
Until that time,
you're under house arrest.

1739

01:55:35,452 --> 01:55:38,733
You're not to leave
your quarters until further notice.

1740

01:55:43,973 --> 01:55:47,013
I'm doing this because I feel you're not
responsible at the moment, Lloyd.

1741

01:55:47,093 --> 01:55:49,413
After all, I've known
your father for years.

1742

01:55:55,374 --> 01:55:56,934
Well, that's all.

1743

01:56:31,176 --> 01:56:32,215
Mike...

1744

01:56:33,295 --> 01:56:34,376
Did you see her?

1745

01:56:34,456 --> 01:56:35,776
No, Ace. I couldn't even get
near the place.

1746

01:56:35,816 --> 01:56:36,816
They've really clamped down.

1747

01:56:36,896 --> 01:56:39,016
I went to the stage
door and I couldn't even see Fumiko-san.

1748

01:56:39,096 --> 01:56:41,657
Well, listen, I've got to see her.
I'm being shipped out of here tomorrow.

1749

01:56:42,016 --> 01:56:43,376
Major Gruver?

1750

01:56:43,456 --> 01:56:44,537
What is it?

1751

01:56:44,616 --> 01:56:45,737
Would you do
something for us?

1752

01:56:45,776 --> 01:56:46,977
What do you want?

1753
01:56:47,736 --> 01:56:49,257
Airman Kelly's disappeared.

1754

01:56:49,337 --> 01:56:52,217
No, that's impossible.
I was with him just last night.

1755

01:56:52,297 --> 01:56:53,297
We know.

1756

01:56:53,377 --> 01:56:54,777
He was scheduled to fly out
in a couple days.

1757

01:56:54,857 --> 01:56:58,257
But a special plane came through, and
Colonel Crawford told us to get him on it.

1758

01:56:58,337 --> 01:57:00,657
I took him to
the airport at 12:50.

1759

01:57:00,737 --> 01:57:03,458
When the plane took off,
Kelly wasn't on it.

1760

01:57:03,497 --> 01:57:04,778
Figured you might
know where he is.

1761

01:57:04,818 --> 01:57:08,058
How should I know where he is?
His house has been boarded up, hasn't it?

1762

01:57:08,137 --> 01:57:10,858
We know.
Neighbors won't talk to us.

1763

01:57:10,938 --> 01:57:12,538
We figure maybe
they're hiding him.

1764

01:57:13,098 --> 01:57:15,538
They'll talk with you, Major.
Would you help us?

1765

01:57:16,418 --> 01:57:19,018
Well, would you give
me one good reason why I should?

1766

01:57:21,019 --> 01:57:22,818
We figured we'd
give him a break.

1767

01:57:22,858 --> 01:57:24,458
We haven't reported
him as yet.

1768

01:57:24,498 --> 01:57:26,499
We could get him
on another plane.

1769

01:57:26,538 --> 01:57:28,499
We might not have
to turn him in for desertion.

1770

01:57:30,579 --> 01:57:32,259
- Desertion?
-Yes, sir.

1771

01:57:35,979 --> 01:57:37,099
Well...

1772

01:57:38,739 --> 01:57:40,299
I'll go with
you in a minute.

1773

01:57:40,819 --> 01:57:41,939
Major?

1774

01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:44,779
The neighbors won't
talk if they see an MP.

1775

01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,900
I'll go with him.

1776

01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,460
Thank you, sir.

1777

01:58:45,583 --> 01:58:46,783
Kelly?

1778

01:58:49,983 --> 01:58:51,503
Kelly, Gruver out here.

1779

01:58:53,903 --> 01:58:55,183
I think he's in there.

1780

01:58:57,343 --> 01:58:58,384
Kelly?

1781

01:59:00,463 --> 01:59:01,983
I'm going on in.

1782

01:59:15,464 --> 01:59:16,504
Kelly?

1783

01:59:23,625 --> 01:59:24,625
Kelly?

1784

01:59:31,185 --> 01:59:33,425
Kelly, you in there?

1785

01:59:56,547 --> 01:59:57,987
Oh, my God.

1786

02:00:01,747 --> 02:00:02,707
Oh, my...

1787

02:00:11,308 --> 02:00:12,268
Oh...

1788

02:00:14,188 --> 02:00:15,148
Oh.

1789

02:00:23,028 --> 02:00:24,109
Oh.

1790

02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:27,188
Oh.

1791

02:00:30,669 --> 02:00:32,628
I'll call the police, Ace.

1792

02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,070
Oh, God.

1793

02:02:24,475 --> 02:02:27,195
Go home! Go home!

1794

02:02:28,155 --> 02:02:32,475
Go home! Go home! Go home!

1795

02:02:33,155 --> 02:02:36,635
Ace, there's no police around.
We'd better get out of here.

1796

02:02:38,236 --> 02:02:39,316
Hey, look.

1797

02:02:47,076 --> 02:02:48,476
Doesn't look too good, boy.

1798

02:02:51,676 --> 02:02:54,557
Go home! Go home!

1799

02:02:55,316 --> 02:02:56,676
Come on, take it easy.

1800

02:03:28,398 --> 02:03:30,038
We're getting help, Ace.

1801

02:03:43,239 --> 02:03:45,199
- You okay, boy?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1802

02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:46,479
You all right?

1803

02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:47,599
Yeah.

1804

02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:49,519
Listen, I'm going to...

1805

02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:52,599
I want you to take care of everything.
Will you?

1806

02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:54,239
- Oh, yeah, I'll get it...
- Okay.

1807

02:03:55,239 --> 02:03:56,360
I'll see you later.

1808

02:04:42,402 --> 02:04:43,482
Hey, where's Hana-ogi?

1809

02:04:43,522 --> 02:04:44,722
Hana-ogi's not here.

1810

02:04:44,802 --> 02:04:46,362
Oh, I know she's here.

1811

02:04:46,402 --> 02:04:47,882
She is on her way Tokyo.

1812

02:04:47,963 --> 02:04:50,242
No, she wasn't... She wasn't
supposed to go to Tokyo till next week.

1813

02:04:50,283 --> 02:04:51,442
She went today.

1814

02:04:51,523 --> 02:04:52,923
I don't believe you.

1815

02:04:52,962 --> 02:04:55,043
- Mr. Gruver...
- I don't believe you.

1816

02:04:55,203 --> 02:04:56,163
I don't care...

1817

02:05:41,326 --> 02:05:42,605
Hana-ogi?

1818

02:05:52,806 --> 02:05:55,726
Hana-ogi. Hana-ogi.

1819

02:05:56,366 --> 02:05:57,606
Hana-ogi.

1820

02:06:07,607 --> 02:06:08,646
Hana-ogi?

1821

02:06:15,727 --> 02:06:17,007
Gruver-san!

1822

02:06:17,087 --> 02:06:19,207
-Hey, where's Hana-ogi?
- She's gone.

1823

02:06:19,247 --> 02:06:20,688
- Where's her room?
-She's gone.

1824

02:06:20,767 --> 02:06:22,527
Listen, where's her room?

1825

02:06:23,408 --> 02:06:24,687
Come here.

1826

02:06:28,248 --> 02:06:30,288
Hana-ogi really gone, Major.

1827

02:06:30,727 --> 02:06:32,448
I don't believe you.

1828

02:06:33,168 --> 02:06:34,528
Hana-ogi.

1829

02:06:40,408 --> 02:06:42,089
I give you my word.

1830

02:06:42,729 --> 02:06:44,569
You go now, too, Major.

1831

02:06:45,369 --> 02:06:46,648
It's over.

1832

02:06:47,769 --> 02:06:49,928
Listen, leave me
alone a minute, will you?

1833

02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:08,970
The hoodlums who attacked
you weren't all your Japanese neighbors.

1834

02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:11,210
For the most part, they were
professional troublemakers

1835

02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:14,570
sent to your street
to create an incident specifically with you.

1836

02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:17,171
Now, if you're important
to those who hate us,

1837

02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:20,530
don't you see how
important you are to us?

1838

02:07:23,371 --> 02:07:25,291
Do you understand
any of this, Lloyd?

1839
02:07:28,331 --> 02:07:30,011
I know how you feel.

1840

02:07:30,331 --> 02:07:31,531
It was...

1841

02:07:32,292 --> 02:07:34,971
It was dreadful about
your friend Kelly and...

1842

02:07:36,091 --> 02:07:37,332
And his wife.

1843

02:07:39,731 --> 02:07:41,452
Must be hard to take.

1844

02:07:43,971 --> 02:07:45,012
And I...

1845

02:07:45,092 --> 02:07:49,212
I hate to tell you
something else, because it's

1846

02:07:50,092 --> 02:07:52,012
almost too grotesque.

1847

02:07:55,212 --> 02:07:57,373
Almost unforgivable in
your eyes, I imagine.

1848

02:07:58,252 --> 02:07:59,933
I got word today that...

1849

02:08:01,532 --> 02:08:04,013
There's a law being passed
in a month or two

1850

02:08:04,933 --> 02:08:07,333
that will make it possible
for men like Kelly

1851

02:08:08,373 --> 02:08:12,054
to take their
Japanese brides back to the States.

1852

02:08:16,454 --> 02:08:17,934
That can't be true, General.

1853

02:08:18,454 --> 02:08:20,934
Well, it happens
to be true, Lloyd.

1854

02:08:26,254 --> 02:08:27,454
Listen.

1855

02:08:28,294 --> 02:08:30,734
How do you get
the guts to come here and tell me that?

1856

02:08:31,655 --> 02:08:34,214
It takes time to get
laws passed, Lloyd.

1857

02:08:34,255 --> 02:08:38,255
And a lot of people have died
in this world needlessly, waiting for them.

1858

02:08:39,415 --> 02:08:40,415
Well, it's...

1859

02:08:40,495 --> 02:08:43,055
It's harder to take
when it hits you personally.

1860

02:08:45,975 --> 02:08:47,055
Lloyd...

1861

02:08:48,175 --> 02:08:50,255
You're lost. You're confused.

1862

02:08:52,175 --> 02:08:55,455
Don't you think it's time you got back
to the main stream of your life?

1863

02:08:56,056 --> 02:08:57,136
Back to your roots?

1864

02:08:57,176 --> 02:08:59,056
What you were born for,
and raised for?

1865

02:09:00,495 --> 02:09:02,376
You'll feel better
about everything when you get back home,

1866

02:09:02,416 --> 02:09:04,296
back to your work.

1867

02:09:07,457 --> 02:09:09,216
Appreciate you
coming over, General.

1868

02:09:49,859 --> 02:09:51,979
Take me to the airport, Mike.

1869

02:09:57,619 --> 02:09:59,339
That must be him.

1870

02:09:59,819 --> 02:10:01,299
Would you hold it,
so we can get a picture, General?

1871

02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:03,820
- Where would you like me? Right here?
-What about there? Yeah.

1872

02:10:05,819 --> 02:10:06,899
Smile, please.

1873

02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:15,020
Hey, Bill, isn't
that Ace Gruver?

1874

02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:16,980
Looks like him.

1875

02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:20,740
Sir?

1876

02:10:21,941 --> 02:10:24,421
Excuse me, aren't
you Major Gruver? Ace Gruver?

1877

02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:25,580
Yes, that's right.

1878

02:10:25,621 --> 02:10:26,900
Well, we're
from Stars and Stripes.

1879

02:10:26,981 --> 02:10:28,341
What are you doing
in Tokyo?

1880

02:10:28,941 --> 02:10:31,420
Well, I'm just passing
through, boys.

1881

02:10:31,501 --> 02:10:32,940
Just seeing the sights, huh?

1882

02:10:32,981 --> 02:10:36,341
That's right. Listen, I'm in a hurry.
Do you mind if I excuse myself?

1883

02:10:36,381 --> 02:10:38,101
- You're excused.
-Sorry.

1884

02:12:50,908 --> 02:12:51,908
Lloyd-san.

1885

02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:14,909
Hello, Hana-ogi.

1886

02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:20,510
I'm going back to
America on Friday.

1887

02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:23,710
And I probably won't

1888

02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:26,750
get back in Japan again.

1889

02:13:29,790 --> 02:13:32,070
And before I go,
there was just...

1890

02:13:33,870 --> 02:13:35,871
Just one thing
I wanted to know.

1891

02:13:38,751 --> 02:13:41,311
You remember one
time you said to me...

1892

02:13:43,751 --> 02:13:45,671
That you could love me

1893

02:13:47,551 --> 02:13:49,631
and be a wife and a mother?

1894

02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:52,511
I remember.

1895

02:13:55,352 --> 02:13:58,432
You said that since
you'd known me, you'd been afraid

1896

02:13:59,712 --> 02:14:01,952
of being
a lonely old woman, teaching dancing.

1897

02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:04,192
Remember that?

1898

02:14:05,633 --> 02:14:06,952
I remember.

1899

02:14:08,672 --> 02:14:11,633
Did you mean that
when you said it, Hana-ogi?

1900

02:14:13,113 --> 02:14:14,432
I meant it.

1901

02:14:15,313 --> 02:14:17,113
It is already happening.

1902

02:14:17,153 --> 02:14:20,193
Love has gone out
of my work, out of me.

1903

02:14:21,833 --> 02:14:24,193
Oh, Lloyd, please go now.

1904

02:14:25,073 --> 02:14:27,554
This will only
bring pain and trouble.

1905

02:14:29,953 --> 02:14:31,154
Hana-ogi,

1906

02:14:32,314 --> 02:14:34,394
you and I are going
to have more trouble

1907

02:14:34,434 --> 02:14:36,354
than we ever
thought of having in our whole lives

1908

02:14:36,394 --> 02:14:39,234
unless you're
absolutely honest with yourself.

1909

02:14:41,954 --> 02:14:45,314
Please, Lloyd, can't we
talk about this later?

1910

02:14:47,875 --> 02:14:49,795
There isn't
going to be any later.

1911

02:14:49,875 --> 02:14:51,754
There's only going
to be right now.

1912

02:14:52,755 --> 02:14:53,715
Oh, uh,

1913

02:14:53,955 --> 02:14:54,915
excuse me, Mother.

1914

02:14:55,995 --> 02:14:56,955
Excuse me.

1915

02:15:00,435 --> 02:15:02,035
I must return this robe.

1916

02:15:02,115 --> 02:15:03,435
Listen to me.

1917

02:15:03,516 --> 02:15:07,235
I want to know.
Do you love me, or don't you?

1918

02:15:09,236 --> 02:15:11,075
Because if you don't,

1919

02:15:11,156 --> 02:15:13,675
then I'm going to
have to find a way to live with it.

1920

02:15:14,716 --> 02:15:16,676
- And if you do, then...
- Please, Lloyd.

1921

02:15:18,916 --> 02:15:21,116
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1922

02:15:24,477 --> 02:15:27,717
Now, I don't want you
to tell me anything more,

1923

02:15:27,757 --> 02:15:31,277
or anything less than
you feel in the very deepest part of you.

1924

02:15:32,397 --> 02:15:33,957
Because what you
answer to me now

1925

02:15:33,997 --> 02:15:36,597
is going to affect us
for the rest of our lives.

1926

02:15:39,438 --> 02:15:41,997
Do you love me, Hana-ogi,
or don't you love me?

1927

02:15:45,998 --> 02:15:48,198
I'm so frightened
and confused.

1928

02:15:48,838 --> 02:15:50,318
I cannot think.

1929

02:15:50,598 --> 02:15:52,518
I cannot even
understand your thinking.

1930

02:15:52,598 --> 02:15:54,238
I'm not thinking!
I'm not thinking...

1931

02:15:54,278 --> 02:15:57,438
For the first time in my life,
I'm not thinking, and I don't care.

1932

02:15:58,919 --> 02:16:00,918
But, Lloyd, we must
do the right thing.

1933

02:16:00,998 --> 02:16:03,559
Oh, what are you talking
about, the right thing?

1934

02:16:03,638 --> 02:16:05,319
We've been wasting
two good lives

1935

02:16:05,398 --> 02:16:06,478
trying to do
the right thing.

1936

02:16:06,559 --> 02:16:07,879
The right thing
for Matsubayashi,

1937

02:16:07,959 --> 02:16:10,439
the right thing
for my father,

1938

02:16:10,479 --> 02:16:11,639
the right thing
for the military,

1939

02:16:11,719 --> 02:16:14,439
the right thing for
Japanese tradition.

1940

02:16:14,519 --> 02:16:16,839
The right thing for
the great white race.

1941

02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:19,480
But we have duties
and obligations.

1942

02:16:19,559 --> 02:16:21,240
That's right, we do.

1943

02:16:21,719 --> 02:16:23,040
We have duties
and obligations.

1944

02:16:23,079 --> 02:16:26,120
And the first obligation we have
is to love each other.

1945

02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:29,880
To become man and wife,
and raise some clean, sweet children.

1946

02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:32,080
And give them
the very best that we know how.

1947

02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:35,080
And if we don't
meet that obligation,

1948

02:16:35,121 --> 02:16:37,161
we ain't going to be
any good to anybody.

1949

02:16:38,121 --> 02:16:41,641
We live in different worlds,
come from different races.

1950

02:16:42,081 --> 02:16:43,201
Oh.

1951

02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:47,760
Honey, I want you
to be my wife.

1952

02:16:49,841 --> 02:16:53,161
But what would happen to our children?
What would they be?

1953

02:16:53,721 --> 02:16:54,882
What would they be?

1954

02:16:55,402 --> 02:16:57,561
They'd be half Japanese,
half American.

1955

02:16:57,641 --> 02:17:00,042
They'd be half
yellow and half white.

1956

02:17:00,561 --> 02:17:03,082
They'd be half you,
they'd be half me.

1957

02:17:03,401 --> 02:17:05,602
That's all they're going to be.

1958

02:17:18,242 --> 02:17:20,842
Hana-ogi, I want you
to come with me now.

1959

02:17:22,683 --> 02:17:25,803
I want you to come with me now,
down to the American Consulate,

1960

02:17:27,243 --> 02:17:28,683
here in Tokyo.

1961

02:17:29,083 --> 02:17:32,444
We're gonna filling out those papers,
'cause we've only got a few days

1962

02:17:32,523 --> 02:17:35,083
to get this whole thing done,
and get it out of the way.

1963

02:17:44,004 --> 02:17:45,084
Will you come?

1964

02:17:55,845 --> 02:17:57,805
I'm going to wait
for you outside.

1965

02:18:27,006 --> 02:18:29,207
Didn't I tell you
he'd be here?

1966

02:18:29,286 --> 02:18:30,766
- Look at this crowd!
- Wow!

1967

02:18:30,847 --> 02:18:32,726
And look who's here,
our rivals.

1968

02:18:32,807 --> 02:18:33,806
What do you know?

1969

02:18:33,887 --> 02:18:36,007
Oh, you guys heard
about it, too, huh?

1970

02:18:36,047 --> 02:18:37,047
No secrets.

1971

02:18:37,127 --> 02:18:39,247
-No secrets in this country!
-well, what are you gonna do?

1972

02:18:44,247 --> 02:18:47,167
Hello, Major.
Well, what a coincidence!

1973

02:18:47,247 --> 02:18:48,808
You got a story
for us, sir?

1974

02:18:50,287 --> 02:18:52,368
No. As a matter
of fact, I don't.

1975

02:18:52,408 --> 02:18:55,168
Oh, now, Major, you're
not going to try to deny it, are you?

1976

02:18:55,248 --> 02:18:57,168
- Deny what?
- Well, the story.

1977

02:18:57,208 --> 02:18:59,888
Why won't you give us a story?
You're big news now, sir.

1978

02:18:59,969 --> 02:19:02,128
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

1979

02:19:04,769 --> 02:19:06,369
Here's Hana-ogi.
Maybe she'll talk.

1980

02:19:23,369 --> 02:19:26,609
Come on, Hana-ogi, that's not fair.
What did you say?

1981

02:19:27,810 --> 02:19:31,490
It is very difficult
for a Japanese woman to speak in public.

1982

02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:34,530
I have never done so.

1983

02:19:35,570 --> 02:19:37,690
But perhaps now
it is the time.

1984

02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:41,810
Major Gruver has
asked me to be his...

1985

02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:43,411
His wife.

1986

02:19:47,411 --> 02:19:49,691
He knows there
are many people in his country

1987

02:19:49,770 --> 02:19:52,171
who will be
disturbed by this.

1988

02:19:52,211 --> 02:19:54,731
I know my people
will be shocked, too.

1989

02:19:55,091 --> 02:19:57,811
But I hope they will
learn to understand

1990

02:19:58,491 --> 02:20:00,211
and someday approve.

1991

02:20:01,291 --> 02:20:04,891
We are not afraid
because we know this is right.

1992

02:20:06,172 --> 02:20:08,492
I hope I can
continue as a dancer.

1993

02:20:09,371 --> 02:20:11,412
And I hope, when I am old,

1994

02:20:11,652 --> 02:20:14,332
I will be able to
teach children to dance.

1995

02:20:15,252 --> 02:20:16,532
My own children.

1996

02:20:17,972 --> 02:20:19,052
Major?

1997

02:20:19,093 --> 02:20:21,052
The big brass are
gonna yell their heads off about this.

1998

02:20:21,133 --> 02:20:23,252
And the Japanese
aren't going to like it much, either.

1999

02:20:23,333 --> 02:20:25,533
Have you got anything
to say to them, sir?

2000

02:20:27,892 --> 02:20:28,893
Yeah.

2001

02:20:30,293 --> 02:20:31,733
Tell them we said sayonara.

2002

02:20:31,973 --> 02:20:35,414
Sayonara

2003

02:20:35,573 --> 02:20:39,053
Japanese goodbye

2004

02:20:39,333 --> 02:20:42,774
Whisper sayonara

2005

02:20:42,973 --> 02:20:46,494
Lover, don't you cry

2006

02:20:46,894 --> 02:20:50,294
No more we stop to see

2007

02:20:50,534 --> 02:20:53,974
Pretty cherry blossom

2008

02:20:54,294 --> 02:20:58,055
No more we beneath the tree

2009

02:20:58,134 --> 02:21:01,415
Looking at the sky

2010

02:21:01,975 --> 02:21:05,095
Sayonara

2011

02:21:05,655 --> 02:21:09,175
Sayonara

2012

02:21:09,375 --> 02:21:13,255
Goodbye
