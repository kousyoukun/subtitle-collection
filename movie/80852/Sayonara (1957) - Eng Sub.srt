# "Japanese goodbye"

6
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,141
Just like a bird!

7
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,137
How many did you get, sir?

8
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,695
- Hey, he got two more!
- Old Gruver got two more!

9
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,774
Nice going there, sir.

10
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:37,089
Let’s try the other lung.

11
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,169
Breathe.

12
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,529
- Breathe.
- Hi, Padre.

13
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,327
- Two more MiGs today, I hear, Lloyd.
- Yeah.

14
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,806
That’s it. You can put it on.

15
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:55,845
- Well, Ace, you’ve had it.
- Say what?

16
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,964
You’re through flying for a while, anyway.

17
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:03,002
Oh, no. Nothing wrong with me
a little bottle of beer isn’t gonna fix up.

18
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:05,403
Give him a bottle of beer
and send him back up.

19
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:11,480
- Don’t get yourself excited here.
- Don’t get pale. I was just giving you a rib.

20
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
But you could use some sleep.

21
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,519
Yeah, I could use
a little nice Korean sleep.

22
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,997
Better than that. You’re going to Japan.

23
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:26,035
- I’m going to Japan? What for?
- Why not?

24
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,754
Wouldn’t you like to tangle with
one of those beautiful Japanese dolls?

25
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:33,953
If it’s your prescription, Doc,
I’ll certainly work at it best I can.

26
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:38,272
You’re going to Kobe.
Kelly has your orders.

27
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:41,231
What in the world am I gonna do in Kobe?

28
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,909
It’s a special request
of General Webster himself.

29
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,788
Well, then, this has all been prearranged?

30
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,428
Prearranged? Demanded.

31
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:58,466
Why shouldn’t a three-star general
look out for a four-star general’s son?

32
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:01,263
Don’t get on my back.
I ain’t buckin’ for favours.

33
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,462
I know you haven’t. I was just kidding.

34
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,342
- See you, Doc. Thanks.
- Can I have a word, Gruver?

35
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:10,741
Yeah. I’ll bet you I know what the word is.
K- e-l-l-y. Is that true or false?

36
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:13,820
He’s got permission to go back
and marry that Japanese girl.

37
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,819
I told him - he can’t take her
back to the States.

38
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,377
I explained the law in detail myself.

39
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:22,099
But there’s no law
which says he can’t marry her,

40
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:24,938
and he’s appealed to his congressman.

41
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:28,496
- His congressman?
- I wish you’d talk to him.

42
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,615
After all, he is one of your men, and you’re
the only human being he looks up to.

43
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:37,414
Listen, I’m gonna tell you something.
That boy don’t look up to anybody.

44
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:42,491
He has been promoted four times
and busted right back again.

45
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,450
Yeah, my congressman.
Shocking, ain’t it, Major?

46
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,889
Chaplain says don’t marry the girl.
Colonel says don’t marry the girl.

47
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,969
You say don’t marry the girl.

48
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:56,287
Congressman says “You marry
that girl, Kelly.” What can I do?

49
00:05:56,407 --> 00:06:00,046
I’ll tell you what you can do, boy.
You can go and marry your congressman.

50
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,125
You’d be better off.

51
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:05,244
Give me coffee.

52
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,325
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:12,842
I hear you bagged two more today, Major.

54
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:15,721
- How was it up there?
- Splendid.

55
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,720
What’s the matter? What happened?

56
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,997
There was a guy with a face
in one of those planes today.

57
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:34,715
There was a guy with a face
in all the other seven you shot down.

58
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,515
Yeah.

59
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,474
That’s exactly
what I’ve been thinking about.

60
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:42,193
Well, you can stop thinking.

61
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,872
You got a very well-written contract here.

62
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:50,871
General Webster’s had you assigned
to the inter-service aviation board,

63
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,831
which means you got
practically nothing to do.

64
00:06:53,951 --> 00:07:00,108
Except, of course, marry the general’s
daughter who arrives in Kobe tomorrow.

65
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,387
- You mean Eileen...?
- That’s right.

66
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:05,907
- General’s wife and daughter both.
- Don’t fool me now.

67
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:11,105
I’m not fooling. You’re not supposed
to know anything about it. Big surprise.

68
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,383
Eileen’s coming to Kobe.

69
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:17,942
Yeah. General Webster arranges it
for you to marry his daughter,

70
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,502
my congressman arranges it
for me to marry my girl.

71
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:25,100
Generals for the officers,
congressmen for the peasants.

72
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,537
Listen, I’m glad you brought that up, boy.

73
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:32,656
I think there’s a little bit of difference
that we oughta talk about.

74
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:35,895
- What do you mean?
- Well, now listen.

75
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,975
I never did show you
a picture of my girl, did I, Kelly?

76
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,415
No.

77
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:43,813
Well, I’m gonna show you
a picture of a girl.

78
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,413
It happens to be my girl,
but she’s American.

79
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,851
And I want you to take
a long, long look at her,

80
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:54,130
because I believe that maybe you forgot
what an American girl looks like.

81
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,648
And this girl I’m gonna show to you
is first of all an American girl,

82
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:04,086
a girl with fine character,
a girl with good background,

83
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:07,047
good education, good family, good blood.

84
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:12,085
I’ve known this girl since I was about
that high. Families are very close.

85
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:15,723
I’ve been engaged to this girl
for a long time, Kelly.

86
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,922
Now, she’s a girl of unusual character.

87
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,403
I’d like you to take a look at her,
a close look,

88
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:25,681
and tell me what you think
and what your feeling is.

89
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:33,638
- Kind of beat up, ain’t she?
- I beg your pardon?

90
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:38,037
No. The beat-up one’s
her mother, you idiot.

91
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:40,116
Here’s Eileen.

92
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,874
- Now, now...
- Hey.

93
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:46,474
" She sure does something wicked
to a bathing suit.

94
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:52,592
She has an enormous capacity
to fulfill a bathing suit. That’s enough.

95
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:54,671
I’m just showing it to you.

96
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,031
But all kidding aside,
the reason I wanna show you this girl...

97
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,550
You ever seen Katsumi?

98
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,028
- Where’s that?
- It’s not a “where’s that?”

99
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:06,829
- It’s the girl I’m marrying.
- Oh. Well, no.

100
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:09,187
I don’t know Japanese names.

101
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:11,667
That’s all right. Forget it.

102
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,504
- Well?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,823
Looks like a bright girl.

104
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:25,702
- She’s a whole lot brighter than me.
- That ain’t too hard to do, you know.

105
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:29,301
Listen, Kelly, I wanna say
something seriously to you.

106
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:32,499
Aren’t you taking a risk
in marrying this Japanese girl?

107
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,859
Risks don’t scare me any.

108
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:38,018
The army and the air force
and the State Department

109
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:40,498
have ganged up
to keep me from getting married.

110
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:43,097
Hold on. What do you mean, ganged up?

111
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:45,776
Here, look at these pamphlets.

112
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:48,775
”Think it over, Americans.”

113
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:53,015
”Things you are required to know and do
before marrying Orientals.”

114
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,292
Here’s another piece of garbage.
”But will your family accept her?”

115
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,411
- Will they, Kelly?
- I ain’t got any family.

116
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:03,889
I haven’t got anything
against this girl of yours.

117
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,329
I haven’t got anything against
the Japanese any more. Not really.

118
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,768
But, you know, when...

119
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:16,726
I just don’t understand
how a normal, average American...

120
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,965
Let’s put it this way.

121
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:23,845
I think even your friends are gonna
put you down if you marry this girl.

122
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:28,722
If the friends I got are that kind, they won’t
be friends of mine much longer.

123
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:33,762
Major, I’m gonna marry my girl if I have to
give up my American citizenship to do it.

124
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:37,320
Kelly, you stupid, ignorant slob.

125
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,679
Go ahead and marry this slant-eyed runt
if you want to. It’ll serve you right.

126
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,517
Wait a minute, Major.
Don’t talk to me that way!

127
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:48,037
I won’t take that
from you or anybody else.

128
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,675
I’m sorry, Kelly.

129
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,115
I’m sorry.

130
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,032
I’m just blowing my stack a little today.

131
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:04,032
But, boy, I mean it. I...

132
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:10,550
I wanna tell you, when you tell me
that you’re gonna give up your citizenship

133
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,510
for a girl, any girl,

134
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,709
I think you’re nuts.

135
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:21,066
- I think you’re crazy.
- I am crazy. I’m in love crazy.

136
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,945
I think you’re gonna cut your throat
and I’d just hate to see you do it.

137
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,824
And I mean that with all sincerity.

138
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:34,462
Maybe that’s because you don’t feel
as strong about your girl as I do mine.

139
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,021
There’s your orders, Major.

140
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:41,101
See you on the plane.

141
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,138
OK.

142
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:55,576
Kelly.

143
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:04,813
We’re coming in, Major.
There’s the Inland Sea.

144
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,291
Beautiful, ain’t it?
Sure is nice scenery out there.

145
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,290
That’s Kobe over there.
See it, with all the docks?

146
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,968
What you’re looking at, Major,
really is three cities all run together.

147
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,688
There’s Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto.

148
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,767
- They got kabuki there.
- What’s kabuki?

149
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:26,925
Never heard of kabuki theatre?
All men, no dames.

150
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:30,524
- That’s gonna be dull, ain’t it?
- I don’t know.

151
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:34,722
If it’s all dames you want,
I think we’re gonna get there in about...

152
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:36,883
Yep. Look down there.

153
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:41,321
See that little park over there with
the lakes around it? That’s Matsubayashi.

154
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,960
- Where?
- Right down in there. See it?

155
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,878
The Matsubayashi girls
are the most famous in Japan.

156
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:49,957
They sing, they dance,
they act all the parts. No men.

157
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,997
Katsumi knows all the actresses.
She’s a movie fan.

158
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:58,156
You’re just blowin’ your top about
seeing Katsumi, aren’t you? Carryin’ on...

159
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,235
She’s my girl, Major.

160
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,470
- Well, GG, good to see you.
- So long, Lloyd.

161
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,029
- Lots of luck to you.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

162
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,269
Lloyd! Lloyd! Here we are.

163
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:24,987
Lloyd!

164
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:27,866
- Hey, there!
- Don’t forget to act surprised.

165
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:31,145
Yeah, hi there! Hot dog!

166
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:33,664
Won’t he be surprised!

167
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,743
- Major?
- Yeah?

168
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,663
How about being my best man?

169
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:46,741
Listen, Kelly, I told you
that I’m against this marriage.

170
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:50,699
It would mean a lot to me.
What do you say, Major?

171
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,498
OK.

172
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,296
Consul’s office. 10 o’clock, Saturday.

173
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:08,774
Well, come on, honey. Hurry up.

174
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,651
Well, now. Come here, you!

175
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,851
Hi!

176
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:20,929
Certainly good to see you.
Hi, sir. Nice to see you.

177
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:25,969
I said “There’s General Webster
but who is that good-looking woman?”

178
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,807
- Tell me about Eileen. How is she?
- She finds Tulsa terribly dull without you.

179
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:33,646
Well, I wish she could have come along.

180
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:36,924
Lloyd, you couldn’t expect us
to bring her out here.

181
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:40,845
You’re registered at the hotel for the first
few nights but stationed here after that.

182
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,444
- I see.
- Let’s go. You get in first.

183
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:46,843
- You go ahead, Mrs. Webster.
- No, you get in first.

184
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:49,481
- Go on, get in.
- No, ladies first.

185
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Hi, Lloyd.

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,279
You devil.

187
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,358
Come here.

188
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,836
I’m glad to see you, darling.

189
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:16,833
I forgot what an ugly girl you got here.

190
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:19,272
She’s not ugly. She’s a beautiful girl.

191
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:22,151
She’s the ugliest girl I ever saw.

192
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:29,110
And that dress is terrible.
It just goes in and out. That’s awful.

193
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,748
It’s meant to go in and out. I go in and out.

194
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:35,706
Well, we’ll talk about that later.

195
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:49,143
Send Major Gruver’s luggage
up to his room, will you?

196
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,022
That’s beautiful, isn’t it?

197
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:54,701
- Are there any rules against it?
- No, but it’s understood...

198
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,701
I thought the club would be honored.

199
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,860
Please, Mike, let’s go.

200
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,339
- What’s she doing here?
- Mother!

201
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,457
- Isn’t she with that young officer?
- Kobe’s a recreation centre.

202
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:11,817
- That’s right.
- It degrades the uniform.

203
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,814
- It’s out-and-out fraternization.
- She’s beautiful.

204
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,334
All the more reason.

205
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,413
Mark?

206
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,093
Colonel Crawford.

207
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:24,653
- Let’s get outta this clip joint.
- Just a minute, Captain Bailey.

208
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:28,971
- What’s the trouble?
- I didn’t mean to bother you with this.

209
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:32,090
Captain Bailey here is wanting
to take her into the club.

210
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:38,448
General Webster, sir, this young lady
is one of Japan’s most famous dancers.

211
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,887
She’s no ordinary...

212
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,967
Yes, I understand.

213
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:48,524
Even so, don’t you realize
this club is only for American personnel?

214
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:53,803
Now, we’ve been pretty easy
about fraternization in this area,

215
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,361
even though there are
strict orders against it.

216
00:16:56,481 --> 00:17:01,919
But when an officer
who should be an example...

217
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,198
Am I to understand, sir,
that you personally

218
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,718
refuse to allow me
to take this young lady into the club?

219
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,356
I understand how you feel, Captain,
and I’m very embarrassed, but I’m sorry.

220
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,955
- Thank you.
- Thank you, "sir."

221
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:20,953
Don’t you know there’s such a thing
as insolence through manner?

222
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,034
Thank you, "sir."

223
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:32,951
Come on in, boys. Eileen has to change.

224
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,909
- Eileen’s taking you to the kabuki tonight.
- Good.

225
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,468
We met Mr. Nakamura, the head actor,
and he invited her to come.

226
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:44,027
Isn’t that where there’s no dames
and the men play all the women’s parts?

227
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,306
That’s right, the way they do at Princeton.
Come on, Mark.

228
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,745
It’s gonna be fun. Come on, baby.

229
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,296
Did you bring your lunch?

230
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,012
”Miss Eileen Webster.” Ah!

231
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,279
- Who’s fightin’ her?
- That’s Nakamura.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,039
- He’s the one I met. He’s very famous.
- Is that Nakamura?

233
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:20,477
It’s about a lady who turns into a lion.

234
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:25,556
She gonna turn into a lion right here?
I wanna see that.

235
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:49,267
I love you, Lloyd. I love you terribly.

236
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:53,026
I always have and I guess I always will.

237
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:55,107
I love you, honey.

238
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,505
Awful glad you’re here, too.

239
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:10,703
Everybody acting
like nobody ever kissed in the world.

240
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,969
She wouldn’t be half so ugly if she didn’t
stick her face in that flour barrel.

241
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:54,210
She?

242
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:56,288
Well, whatever.

243
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,168
He had me.

244
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:10,723
He’s a male actress. It says here
they’ve been trained since childhood

245
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:13,722
to have the grace of a woman
and yet the power of a man.

246
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:14,922
Oh, my word.

247
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:19,520
My lord! That’s my father!

248
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,630
Is he man enough now for you, Lloyd?

249
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,669
Is that the same fellow?

250
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,549
Uh-huh.

251
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:14,343
It’s all right.

252
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,460
I am sure it must be very difficult

253
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,218
to enjoy theatre
so different from your own.

254
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:33,816
- We found it fascinating.
- I am glad.

255
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,615
Kabuki’s very old, isn’t it?

256
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:40,056
Some 300 years.

257
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:44,054
I find myself becoming intrigued
by everything in Japan.

258
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:50,011
I should be happy to help you know
my country better, if at any time I can.

259
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:55,450
You did not enjoy the evening so much,
I fear, Major Gruver.

260
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:58,610
Oh, yeah. I thought it was a fine play.

261
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:05,247
I thought maybe you could use a Marilyn
Monroe here and there, you know, to...

262
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:13,284
Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred
from kabuki in the 17th century.

263
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:18,203
I didn’t mean to sound corny.
I just didn’t know what to say about it.

264
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:20,642
Please, do not apologize.

265
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:25,561
I am great admirer of Miss Monroe myself.

266
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:28,919
That’s two of us. That’s you and me, boy.

267
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:38,356
No, don’t do it to me. It’s real good.
Thank you very much. Why not?

268
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:41,876
- Let’s go and see the garden.
- OK, you go on. I’ll take this.

269
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:46,915
That’s fine, fine cooking. Very good.

270
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:56,911
Here you are, honey.

271
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,990
- No, thank you.
- Don’t care for any?

272
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,149
- Sit down, darling.
- You look awful pretty.

273
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,868
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking
with you away, Lloyd.

274
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,826
- Answer me one thing.
- What’s that, honey?

275
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:16,305
Why aren’t we married now?

276
00:24:17,184 --> 00:24:20,984
- Isn’t that a silly question?
- No, not really.

277
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,703
You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.

278
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:28,022
Well, I suppose the Korean War
might have a little something to do with it.

279
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:31,580
Wasn’t Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?

280
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:32,780
Convenient?

281
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,137
What I really mean is... do I mean
everything to you as you do to me?

282
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:40,817
Course you do, honey.

283
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,457
I went to visit your mother
before I came here, there in Richmond.

284
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:45,417
My mother?

285
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:48,575
I was appalled at the loneliness
in which she lives,

286
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,934
and the way your father’s content to go off

287
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,374
and leave her walled up
in a circle of friends

288
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:56,293
while he plunges off to the war.

289
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,451
Hold on a second. You’ve got to
remember my father’s a general, honey.

290
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:02,731
Besides, my mother
wants to live that way.

291
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,330
- Don’t be ridiculous.
- Don’t tell me that.

292
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,729
No woman wants to live any way except
body and soul with the man she loves.

293
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:13,728
You’ll never tuck me away
in some little town.

294
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:17,567
Become the greatest general
in air-force history, but love me too.

295
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:20,525
But do I love you, baby. I do.

296
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:28,803
Well, I guess all I’m trying to say is that -
and I really mean this, Lloyd -

297
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:32,281
if what you want
is a family like our fathers have

298
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:35,161
and promotion in the air force

299
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,119
and position in society
like our mothers have,

300
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:45,798
and you marry me because I’m pretty and
smart and have guts and know the ropes...

301
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:51,995
then I don’t think
you want to marry me, Lloyd.

302
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:55,955
I’m sorry.
I guess I’ve been thinking too much.

303
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:01,193
Yeah, I think you have
been thinking too much.

304
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,266
Now...

305
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:21,425
Now quit it.

306
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,585
OK. I don’t know.
Maybe things’ll turn out after all.

307
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:28,704
What do you mean, maybe?
Sure, it’s gonna turn out.

308
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:33,142
It’s just all that nonsense you talk about
every time we get together.

309
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:36,902
Nonsense? I hadn’t realized
it was nonsense.

310
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:39,661
Course it is, honey. It’s all very simple.

311
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:41,580
Now, look here.

312
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:46,577
I want a wife and a family.
I want a home in America.

313
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:51,656
And every time I think of a home like that,
I think about it with a woman like you.

314
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,135
A girl with a good army
background like my own...

315
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:58,614
What do you mean, a girl like me?
I’m not a type. I’m me.

316
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,893
Lloyd, it’s me you’ve got to love.

317
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:07,971
Haven’t you ever felt like grabbing me and
hauling me off to a shack somewhere?

318
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:11,012
You know better than that.
Of course I have.

319
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,489
- Then what’s holding you back?
- Eileen, are you ever gonna grow up?

320
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,648
There’s a right time
and a wrong time to do things.

321
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:22,207
You have responsibilities to other people.
You have a position to fulfill.

322
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:26,126
- You’re not alone in this world.
- You defend yourself like a fort.

323
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:31,004
No matter how I defend myself, you gotta
understand I am not in a position

324
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:35,602
to be hauling my fiancée away
to a shack somewhere like an alley cat.

325
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:37,801
I wasn’t brought up that way.

326
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,362
You’re going to do everything
expected of you?

327
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,641
I’m certainly gonna try.

328
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,799
I don’t expect you to marry me
just because it’s expected of you.

329
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,358
Sometimes I look at you
and I don’t understand you.

330
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:55,237
I think sometimes I don’t even know
who you are or what you’re all about.

331
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:58,837
Maybe you don’t. Maybe you never will.

332
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:17,230
- …so long as you both shall live?
- I will.

333
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,109
Katsumi, wilt though have this man
to thy wedded husband,

334
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:23,668
to live together after God’s ordinance
in the holy state of matrimony,

335
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,427
love him, comfort him, honor
and keep him, in sickness and in health,

336
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:34,185
and forsaking all others keep thee only
unto him, so long as you both shall live?

337
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:38,384
- She will.
- She will.

338
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:43,822
If any man can show just cause why
they may not be lawfully joined together,

339
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:47,741
let him now speak
or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.

340
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:57,138
Do you realize
you waive all your legal rights?

341
00:28:57,258 --> 00:28:59,257
I signed all the papers, didn’t I?

342
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:03,296
You’ll have to look after your wife on
your own. The air force is not responsible.

343
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:06,775
Yeah, I know. Romantic, ain’t it, Major?

344
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:11,933
Will you finish this ugly deed
and get it over?

345
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:14,332
I pronounce you man and wife.
Sign over there.

346
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,412
Just a minute.

347
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:38,404
That’s it, Mrs. Kelly. Just you and me now.

348
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:51,681
Where do we sign?

349
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:54,200
May as well witness this now, Major.

350
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,961
Yeah, all right.

351
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,519
It was a great honor meeting you,
Major Gruver.

352
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:02,358
Thank you.

353
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:07,836
Tell me, Consul, are all these ceremonies
conducted like this?

354
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:11,836
Well, we do our best
to prevent as many as possible.

355
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:16,713
We make the paperwork so difficult
that a good many of them lose steam.

356
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:22,711
About how many GIs
have gone through this ceremony?

357
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,311
About... 10,000.

358
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:31,629
10,000? Well, then,
you let a few slip by you, didn’t you?

359
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,708
A few, yes.

360
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:37,426
How’s your girl, Major?

361
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:40,226
Eileen? I haven’t seen her
in a couple of days.

362
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,986
I’ve been moving in,
getting my things arranged.

363
00:30:43,106 --> 00:30:48,183
She’s been hightailing it
with the brass, socializing.

364
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:52,182
Major, ain’t you gonna kiss the bride?

365
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:56,380
Sure, I’m gonna kiss the bride.

366
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,419
Yeah. Sure.

367
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:05,017
Listen, I want you to take good care
of this boy, you hear?

368
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:11,376
Here’s your ticket, honey. Don’t forget it.

369
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:14,335
OK, boy.

370
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:19,413
Thanks, Major. Took a lot of guts
for you to come here today.

371
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:20,492
Quit.

372
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:25,450
If you ever need a job done that you West
Point guys ain’t allowed to do yourselves,

373
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:26,892
I’m your man.

374
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:31,050
- I’m gonna call on you.
- Come on, let’s get a belt.

375
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,329
- How are you, Lloyd?
- Fine, just fine.

376
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,007
- That’s a pretty dress you got on.
- Thanks.

377
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,326
Lloyd, sit down, son.

378
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:41,406
All righty.

379
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:48,844
- Thank you for coming over so promptly.
- That’s all right. I was just darning socks.

380
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,523
Lloyd...

381
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:57,282
I don’t exactly know how to put this.
It’s a little embarrassing. For me, that is.

382
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:00,520
You were a witness
at a marriage yesterday between...

383
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:03,839
one of your men and a Japanese girl.

384
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,238
Yeah, one of the men
from my outfit in Korea.

385
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:14,197
You realize, of course, there’s an army
policy to discourage all such marriages.

386
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:19,993
I think they couldn’t have been
discouraged. They’re very much in love.

387
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:25,632
I dare say. However, you personally
seemed to sanction the marriage...

388
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:29,072
No, I didn’t mean
to give that impression at all.

389
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:32,711
I didn’t sanction it.
I tried to talk him out of it before.

390
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:36,670
But, Lloyd, darling,
you did act as his witness.

391
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,747
Well, as long as
it was gonna be inevitable,

392
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,668
I thought I might as well
try to make it pleasant.

393
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,028
Don’t you see the position
that puts me in?

394
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:47,866
Since I’m the area commander here...

395
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:52,785
You didn’t do anything to encourage
this marriage, sir. I did all this on my own.

396
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,705
What do you mean?
On your own, Lloyd, dear?

397
00:32:56,824 --> 00:33:01,782
Everything you do reflects on the general.
After all, he is Eileen’s father.

398
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:04,420
This places me
in a position of incompetence

399
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:08,779
when it comes to doing anything
to help my own men.

400
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:13,378
Let’s stop beating around the bush.
What’s wrong between you and Eileen?

401
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:17,137
You haven’t been to see her
for several days.

402
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:25,654
Well... you talked about
being embarrassed, sir, before.

403
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:28,054
I’m embarrassed too.

404
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,813
- What about?
- About my whole situation here.

405
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:35,652
I’m a pilot, sir. I was doing a job in Korea.
An unfinished job.

406
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,770
I’m pulled off that job and sent here

407
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,010
and plonked down at a desk
at this inter-service whatever it is.

408
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,407
As far as I can see,
there’s absolutely nothing to do.

409
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:47,647
All so’s I can be with Eileen.

410
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:51,806
There’s nothing dishonest about it.
That is, if you plan to get married.

411
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:56,805
- I think I know how Lloyd feels.
- Do you plan to get married or not?

412
00:33:56,925 --> 00:34:00,684
- Really, dear.
- I’m her mother. I want to know.

413
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:08,441
Well, Mrs. Webster, as of the moment,
Eileen isn’t too sure about it and I...

414
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:14,640
We know, Lloyd, dear. There’s evidently
been some slight strain between you two,

415
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,479
but don’t let it become too important.

416
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,237
This is Sunday night. Why don’t you
call her up later and ask her out to dinner?

417
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:23,517
Well...

418
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:27,036
Mother, I found the dearest little shop...

419
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:30,034
- Hi, Lloyd.
- Hello, Eileen.

420
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:32,513
Lloyd just came in to see you.

421
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,634
Oh?

422
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,671
Listen...

423
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:41,591
I thought... It’s Sunday night
and I thought maybe

424
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:47,510
you and I can go out and catch a movie
or something, if you feel like it.

425
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,188
I’m sorry, Lloyd. I’m having dinner
with some friends tonight.

426
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:54,187
Well, what about tomorrow?

427
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,426
That’s booked too, I’m afraid.

428
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:04,943
Well, it looks as though
I’m holding pretty tough cards.

429
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:09,182
What about next week?

430
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,501
Of course, Lloyd. Call me.

431
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,219
OK.

432
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:21,779
Mrs. Webster, General.

433
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:23,858
- Goodbye, Lloyd.
- Goodbye, Eileen.

434
00:35:23,978 --> 00:35:25,937
Goodbye, Lloyd.

435
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:35,973
Eileen, why did you tell him
you were busy tonight?

436
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:41,172
Because I don’t want to see Lloyd Gruver
when you ask him to see me.

437
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:46,731
Besides, I do have a date with that young
lieutenant and his wife from Fort Bragg.

438
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,810
A whole bunch of us.

439
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:57,886
I hope you don’t lose my man for me.

440
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:21,639
Give me a martini, will you?

441
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:24,279
No, make it a lemonade.

442
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:27,958
No, give me a scotch and soda.

443
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:31,875
- Scotch and soda.
- Scotch and soda, sir.

444
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:36,954
There’s such a thing as insolence
through manner, you know.

445
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:45,112
I hate to admit it,
but I guess that’s what I said.

446
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:51,910
I thought it sounded kinda strange coming
from a guy who shot down nine MiGs.

447
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,228
That’s a kind of reflex action.
I’m a West Point man, you know.

448
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,988
I guess it sneaks out sometimes.

449
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:06,185
So listen, Captain, what does a fella
do round here after the sun goes down?

450
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:08,785
Why? You on the loose?

451
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,825
Halfway.

452
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,422
Bring him another.

453
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:17,581
What part of the south are you from?

454
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:21,820
Almost any old place
that’s got an army post on it.

455
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,859
I was all set to take the exams
for West Point

456
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:30,178
and there was a teacher there who
made me take a part in the school play.

457
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:34,536
They were doing one of
those Hungarian things by Molnár.

458
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:39,255
You never did hear a Hungarian play
played in a southern accent, did you?

459
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:43,975
- No, I’m afraid I missed that.
- That’s a shame. I was awful good in it.

460
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,974
Anyhow, I suddenly
didn’t wanna go to West Point

461
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:51,372
and didn’t wanna have
anything to do with it.

462
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:54,810
My mother come up to school and...

463
00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:00,648
She said “We expected you to go to
the Point like your father and his father.”

464
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:07,966
And I told her, I said I had an idea
about a whole different way of life.

465
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,126
What’d she say to that?

466
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,965
She said something like...

467
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:18,004
if I ever once had that idea,
I shouldn’t let anything stop me.

468
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:22,682
And she couldn’t come right out
and say “Don’t go to the Point”,

469
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,321
but I knew what she meant.

470
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,440
Then my father flew up from Texas and...

471
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:30,561
He put you straight, huh?

472
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,477
He just looked at me and said “If you don’t
wanna go to the Point, don’t go.”

473
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:40,555
”The unhappiest men I know
are those who...

474
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:44,316
were forced into something
they got no inaptitude for.”

475
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,475
How did he force you to go to the Point?

476
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:50,074
That’s what I’m telling you.
He didn’t force me.

477
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:56,151
We just had a little talk and he flew
back to Texas and I went on to the Point.

478
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:58,471
I see.

479
00:38:58,591 --> 00:39:02,590
Well, I’ll tell you something though, Mike,

480
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,589
I never once had any regrets
about going to the Point.

481
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:12,307
Except, just lately, I’ve had
some old feeling come back on me.

482
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:16,346
I don’t know if I wanna go on
in the air force and buck for a star,

483
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:22,503
get married into the Webster family
and get swallowed up by all that.

484
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:25,463
I think maybe my old lady was right.

485
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:30,222
Well, what does it all mean?

486
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:33,500
The eternal struggle, sex,

487
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,579
New York Yankees.

488
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,818
All right. Quit now. Come on.

489
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:51,134
- Ain’t that a nice-looking bridge?
- That’s the Bitchi-Bashi.

490
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:54,214
- Say what?
- The Bitchi-Bashi.

491
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:59,173
Bashï’s Japanese for bridge. We call
this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi

492
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:03,690
because there’s so much
lovely stuff that goes over it.

493
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,890
Did you say stuff?

494
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,969
Brother, I said stuff.

495
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,848
Would you care to tell me
what we’re standing in the bushes for?

496
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,966
- Can’t touch it.
- Why not?

497
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:19,285
These girls that go over there
are the Matsubayashi girls.

498
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:24,524
They just cross over there on the way
to the theatre from those dormitories.

499
00:40:24,644 --> 00:40:27,363
" That’s right.
Somebody told me about them.

500
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:32,322
Hey, boy, is there anything
going over there now?

501
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:37,319
" Hey, come on.
The goods are on display.

502
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,399
Wait for me, buddy.

503
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:10,069
There’s Fumiko-san,
the one you saw me with.

504
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:13,629
- Yeah, little one in pink.
- Yeah, that’s the one.

505
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:17,507
Are you goin’ over to say hello?

506
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:20,706
In public? A Matsubayashi girl?
Are you nuts?

507
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:24,704
- You’d take her to the officers’ club.
- That’s for Americans.

508
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:27,944
Thought I could sneak her in
without her being recognized.

509
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:31,623
- " What happens if they catch her?
- " Immediate dismissal.

510
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,422
- " No fooling?
- " Yeah.

511
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:36,501
No Matsubayashi girl is allowed
to have dates of any kind.

512
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,900
You were dating her.

513
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,979
Well, I’m different.

514
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,060
Get outta here.

515
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,378
Like I told President Truman “You was
wrong when you sold the marines short.”

516
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:53,376
See, I hate to be stuffy about this, but
you air-force men wouldn’t understand.

517
00:41:53,496 --> 00:42:00,294
The marines have got "l’amour," and these
girls, they got fame, wealth, bright lights.

518
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:04,253
- But they ain’t got "l’amour."
- You got "l’amour."

519
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,610
- What’s going on now?
- Hana-ogi’s coming.

520
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:19,288
- Who?
- Hana-ogi. She’s the top. Number one.

521
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:24,845
Come on, let’s go.

522
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:46,360
How come she’s dressed like that?

523
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,479
Tall ones play men’s parts mostly.

524
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,237
- They play women’s parts too.
- How do you do?

525
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:01,396
What do you say let’s see the show?

526
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,154
Well, come on, Ace.

527
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:40,065
- Do you follow the plot?
- Yeah, nothing wrong with the plot.

528
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:40,094
Are you sure they come back this way?

529
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:43,254
Just keep yourself in check, son.

530
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:46,892
Am I nuts
or is she the greatest thing I ever saw?

531
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:50,373
Whatever you’re thinking, forget it.
You ain’t going anyplace.

532
00:48:50,492 --> 00:48:52,731
Yeah? How’s this for introduction?

533
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:57,130
She comes along and I just kinda
walk on by and slip my arm around her.

534
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,850
- What do you think of that?
- I think we’d better go.

535
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:03,729
- Major.
- Hey, Kelly, how are you?

536
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:07,047
- How’s everything?
- Saw you at the show.

537
00:49:07,168 --> 00:49:10,007
I want you to meet Captain Bailey.
This is Airman Kelly.

538
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:12,165
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

539
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:14,406
- How you been, boy?
- Fine.

540
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:17,765
- Here’s Katsumi.
- Hello there, Katsumi.

541
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:23,563
- Say something, kid.
- It is fine to see you among us tonight.

542
00:49:23,683 --> 00:49:26,682
She’s speaking better English
than you are, boy.

543
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:30,681
She’s been taking English lessons
and I’ve been studying a little Japanese.

544
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,161
Let’s hear you go.

545
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,039
I hope he can get rid of it, don’t you?

546
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,038
It means “My feet are cold”.
She always laughs when I say that.

547
00:49:42,158 --> 00:49:44,636
How you been?
How you gettin’ along down there?

548
00:49:44,756 --> 00:49:48,675
Just fine, Major. We got
a wonderful house down by the canal.

549
00:49:48,796 --> 00:49:52,714
Didn’t you tell me Katsumi
knows those Matsubayashi girls?

550
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:55,474
Sure, she’s a real fan.

551
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:58,113
I want you to do something for me.

552
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:01,993
I am trying in the worst way
to meet this Hana-ogi.

553
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:06,631
And I want you to ask her if she won’t,
you know, kinda introduce me.

554
00:50:20,028 --> 00:50:22,868
She says the rules are very strict
but she’ll ask her.

555
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:25,348
- She will ask her?
- " Oh, yeah.

556
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:29,547
Cos I said to Truman
when he came over to the house,

557
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:33,785
”Harry, don’t ever sell the air force short.”

558
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:44,982
All right, boy.
Now you gonna see something.

559
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,540
Here comes Fumiko-san.

560
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,494
- Here comes Hana-ogi.
- I know it.

561
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:28,451
- You ain’t gonna let me down? Go on.
- It’s all right, Major.

562
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:45,327
How d’you do, Miss Ogi?

563
00:51:49,246 --> 00:51:51,886
You think you made the grade, Ace?

564
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:54,605
She gave me a nice little look there.

565
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:57,083
She sure did.

566
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,799
She says that Hana-ogi
will not speak to an American.

567
00:52:19,918 --> 00:52:21,478
Why not?

568
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:24,797
We shot her brother
and killed her father with our bombs.

569
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:27,037
I didn’t do it.

570
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:30,356
Sure you did, Ace. We all did.

571
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,796
Come on.

572
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,875
Come on, Ace.

573
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:56,869
If they’re so strict with you, how come
you go out with Mike and fool around?

574
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:59,548
It is very bad of me.

575
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:02,548
But I cannot help myself.

576
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,627
He’s so tall.

577
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:12,225
He’s a big boy, all right.
There’s no fooling about that.

578
00:53:12,346 --> 00:53:16,945
But, listen, what I really wanna know is

579
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:21,264
does this Hana-ogi ever go out on dates,
like you and Mike?

580
00:53:21,383 --> 00:53:26,542
No. She’s number one girl.
Must be special careful.

581
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:30,141
Well, I want you to do me a favor.

582
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:34,460
Will you do it? When you go back
to the dormitory tonight,

583
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,937
I want you to tell Hana-ogi that
Major Gruver would like to meet her and...

584
00:53:40,058 --> 00:53:42,738
Wait. Now, wait.

585
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:45,577
I just wanna talk to her for a little while.

586
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:49,496
- Will you do that for me?
- Never happen.

587
00:53:49,616 --> 00:53:53,216
Hana-ogi-san never speak men.

588
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:58,055
And with American never happen.

589
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:03,012
Well, honey, I am here to tell you
that it’s going to happen.

590
00:54:38,963 --> 00:54:45,441
Pardon me, Miss Ogi.
I wonder if I could have your autograph?

591
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:58,557
Thank you very much.

592
00:55:15,594 --> 00:55:17,954
How d’you do, Miss Ogi?

593
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:59,607
Hi, Major. I’ve been looking for you.

594
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:02,886
Hello, Mr. Kelly.

595
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:06,045
The wife says to be at the house tonight.

596
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:12,924
No, I tell you, boy, I have an engagement
this evening with a friend of mine.

597
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:19,082
Be there, bub. Hana-ogi’s coming. Sir.

598
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:25,002
- Kelly...
- Be there early.

599
00:57:25,122 --> 00:57:27,081
Kelly.

600
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,954
- Hello.
- " Hello!

601
00:57:57,913 --> 00:58:00,472
You know where Joe Kelly lives?

602
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:04,072
Over there? You show me, will you?

603
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:14,788
How do?

604
00:58:26,346 --> 00:58:28,785
- Hi, Ace.
- Kelly, is that you?

605
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:32,424
- How are you?
- How are you, Ace?

606
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:36,184
- Nice to see you. Come in the house.
- Let me just take a check here.

607
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,222
- Did she come yet?
- No.

608
00:58:45,861 --> 00:58:46,821
Katsumi.

609
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:58,537
- OK. What she say?
- Don’t ask me.

610
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:02,216
Off with the shoes. You don’t
wear shoes in a Japanese house.

611
00:59:02,336 --> 00:59:05,054
Coming off. What about the pants?

612
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,335
- The room on your right.
- Here?

613
00:59:07,455 --> 00:59:09,414
That’s it.

614
00:59:10,454 --> 00:59:13,172
Watch your head, Ace. This is it.

615
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:17,092
This is all right, boy.
This is cute. This is nice.

616
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:22,292
Sit down over here, Ace. That’s
the place of honor in a Japanese house.

617
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:26,050
What’s this thing?

618
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,889
- This is an armrest.
- Armrest?

619
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,169
Be even better
when the rest of the chair gets here.

620
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:41,405
Hi, Katsumi, darling. How are you?

621
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:43,884
Yeah.

622
00:59:54,524 --> 01:00:00,441
It is very nice to have you... among us.

623
01:00:01,123 --> 01:00:03,880
It’s very nice to be among you too.

624
01:00:15,198 --> 01:00:19,156
I brought a couple of things
you can stick round the house.

625
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:22,796
Yeah. Flowers.

626
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:27,554
You’ve made her very happy, Ace.

627
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:31,073
Are we gonna eat this or wear it?

628
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:35,912
This is a little towel that they serve
before a meal or a drink.

629
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:40,271
- A little refresher for your hands and face.
- That’s a good idea.

630
01:00:40,392 --> 01:00:43,990
Wash ‘em off. OK, clean everywhere.

631
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,070
Do I pass, teacher?

632
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,350
Just dump it in the basket.

633
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:52,469
Yes, sir.

634
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:57,428
What’s this, an eye cup?
We got to wash our eyes out too?

635
01:00:57,548 --> 01:01:01,186
No, that’s a cup for sake.
That’s a wine made out of rice.

636
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:03,946
- Rice? No fooling.
- No fooling.

637
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:06,785
- I’ll try it.
- Taste it. You’ll see.

638
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:10,663
- Feels warm.
- We heat it up before we serve it.

639
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:17,182
Katsumi, here’s to your house.
And, Kelly, very best to you.

640
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,060
- That’s all right, boy. Not bad.
- I told you. It’s wonderful.

641
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,781
- You not gonna have anything?
- I was just gonna say.

642
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,419
There’s kind of a polite thing you do.

643
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:35,819
You take the cup, you swish it around
in the water and pour some sake for her.

644
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:37,898
- OK.
- That’s right.

645
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:45,615
- It means “a little bit”.
- All righty.

646
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,494
Hold on now. Wait. OK.

647
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,692
See? Didn’t hurt.

648
01:01:56,772 --> 01:01:59,293
She’s gonna get me
under the table in five minutes.

649
01:01:59,412 --> 01:02:04,211
She’ll keep pouring all night.
Katsumi, I pour for Gruver-san now.

650
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:09,289
You excuse me? I finish cooking.

651
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:13,848
You go ahead, darling.
Go right ahead. Go right ahead.

652
01:02:21,606 --> 01:02:23,807
A present. Whisky.

653
01:02:23,926 --> 01:02:25,884
Whisky?

654
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,479
Listen, boy, she’s just as cute as a bug.
You ain’t gonna lose with her.

655
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,918
See what I mean, Ace?
I’m the happiest guy in the world.

656
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:56,557
- You wanna see the rest of the house?
- Yeah.

657
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,236
I’ll show you round.

658
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:05,475
This is the garden. Katsumi,
I’m showing him around the house.

659
01:03:09,514 --> 01:03:13,393
The bathroom is back there. We got extra
rooms here. Would you like to see ‘em?

660
01:03:13,514 --> 01:03:15,472
Yeah.

661
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:18,952
What you got here, boy?

662
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:20,271
Oh, lord!

663
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:28,708
We haven’t done anything with these yet
but maybe someday, if we expand.

664
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:31,308
It’s really working out for you, isn’t it?

665
01:03:31,428 --> 01:03:35,308
Everything’s perfect, except for
that rat of a colonel I’m assigned to.

666
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:37,907
You wouldn’t be talking about Crawford?

667
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:41,466
That’s the guy. He rides every guy
that’s married to a Japanese girl.

668
01:03:41,586 --> 01:03:43,865
Extra duty, everything.

669
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:46,784
He’s a rough cob, no getting around that.

670
01:03:46,904 --> 01:03:50,823
So what do I care? I come home to my girl
and I forget it. Let’s go.

671
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:56,500
Wait. I forgot to ask you.
Does this Hana-ogi speak any English?

672
01:03:56,621 --> 01:03:59,021
Those girls sing in a lot of languages.

673
01:03:59,141 --> 01:04:02,140
I guess she’ll be able
to catch your drift, Ace.

674
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:07,659
You nasty boy, you. Wait a minute.
I just got to take a look at my grass now.

675
01:04:07,779 --> 01:04:12,698
Are we gonna be, all four of us
gonna be together all evening long?

676
01:04:12,817 --> 01:04:16,337
Take it easy, Ace.
You’re gonna blow a fuse.

677
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,416
Well...

678
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:22,415
Might be.

679
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:26,214
- Your lumber’s wrong.
- Watch your head, Ace.

680
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:31,172
Katsumi, you ready?

681
01:04:32,412 --> 01:04:35,530
In here? You gonna have to change...

682
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,970
Kelly.

683
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:57,167
Hana-ogi-san.
This is a great day for our house.

684
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:00,926
Major Gruver-san.

685
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:05,764
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

686
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:11,923
- Where you going?
- I gotta help Katsumi with the...

687
01:05:16,242 --> 01:05:21,520
It looks as though everybody’s ran off
and left us alone here.

688
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:25,679
Certainly was nice of you
to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.

689
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:31,158
I was just tickled to death
when they told me you were coming over.

690
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:34,437
I’ll just sit down here.

691
01:05:38,156 --> 01:05:40,117
Well, Miss Ogi.

692
01:05:41,476 --> 01:05:43,835
Let me fix you a little drink.

693
01:05:44,794 --> 01:05:47,754
No, not... Well, OK.

694
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:56,432
Here’s to you.

695
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:03,830
It’s good. Don’t tell me. I know you’ve got
to slosh this around in here a little bit

696
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:08,268
and get the dribble off
and give it right back to you.

697
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:10,348
Now you take that.

698
01:06:12,947 --> 01:06:14,907
All right.

699
01:06:19,106 --> 01:06:22,626
I was surprised to find
that they make that stuff out of rice.

700
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:25,663
We have rice back home in America.

701
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:29,464
We just make rice pudding out of it.
We don’t drink it.

702
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:33,142
This is the first liquid rice I’ve ran into.

703
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,460
You know, did...

704
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:49,538
Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,
that you’re a fine-looking woman?

705
01:06:49,658 --> 01:06:51,618
I mean, really fine.

706
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:58,856
You’re even better looking offstage
than you are on. That’s the truth.

707
01:06:58,976 --> 01:07:02,295
You get up there and sing,
dance, act, everything.

708
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:04,454
You’re all-round great.

709
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:15,732
I wonder where Kelly and Katsumi...
I’m getting kinda hungry again.

710
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,810
Look, Miss Ogi...

711
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:29,687
I’m not up to Japanese ways of doing
things. Maybe I’m saying the wrong thing.

712
01:07:29,808 --> 01:07:33,687
Maybe my American manners
are embarrassing.

713
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:36,206
But I figured,
as you came over here tonight,

714
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:39,246
maybe you were interested
a little bit in meeting me too.

715
01:07:39,366 --> 01:07:46,884
Maybe I’m wrong, but if I’m wrong, then
you got to tell me where we go from here.

716
01:07:47,604 --> 01:07:51,563
Cos I don’t know what to say.
I’m runnin’ out of things to say.

717
01:07:55,242 --> 01:08:01,639
My father was killed by American bomb
dropped on my country.

718
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,439
You have been my enemy.

719
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:09,958
I have hated Americans.

720
01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:12,837
I have thought they are savages.

721
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:17,796
There has been nothing
but vengeance in my heart.

722
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:23,473
Miss Ogi, there were an awful lot
of Americans that were killed too.

723
01:08:24,873 --> 01:08:28,234
I think it would be best
if we forgot about that.

724
01:08:29,912 --> 01:08:33,471
You have been watching me at the bridge.

725
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,552
Watching me dance.

726
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:40,510
Watching me
as I go back to the dormitory.

727
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:44,748
But I have been watching you too.

728
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,547
And you have not looked like a savage.

729
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:53,466
And when Katsumi-san told me
how gently you kissed her

730
01:08:53,586 --> 01:08:56,745
the day she became a bride,

731
01:08:56,865 --> 01:09:00,825
how tenderly you kissed
my sweet little friend,

732
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,504
I realized the hate was of my own making.

733
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:11,902
That is why I came
to ask you to forgive me

734
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,381
for what I have been feeling.

735
01:09:16,341 --> 01:09:19,061
Gruver-san, will you forgive me?

736
01:09:23,499 --> 01:09:27,138
You make me feel
like an awful fool, Miss Ogi.

737
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:33,096
I really feel that
I oughta ask you to forgive me

738
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:38,055
for some of the things that...
I’ve been thinking.

739
01:09:41,294 --> 01:09:46,334
I come from the north of Japan
and my father was a farmer.

740
01:09:46,454 --> 01:09:49,052
There were nine children.

741
01:09:49,172 --> 01:09:51,771
And we were very poor.

742
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:55,771
There are too many people
in my crowded country.

743
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:59,170
I took the examination at Matsubayashi

744
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:01,851
and now I am first dancer of all.

745
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:07,767
When I’m too old to dance,
I will become head teacher.

746
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:12,885
My life is planned.

747
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:16,165
I am dedicated to Matsubayashi,

748
01:10:16,286 --> 01:10:20,245
as you are dedicated
to American military life.

749
01:10:22,564 --> 01:10:25,123
I have never been in love...

750
01:10:26,244 --> 01:10:30,322
but I have dreamed and thought about it...

751
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:33,362
and waited.

752
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:40,760
The danger that lies ahead of us,
we must face now.

753
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,159
The danger of discovery for both of us.

754
01:10:47,759 --> 01:10:52,116
The danger of weakness when it is over.

755
01:10:58,995 --> 01:11:01,554
I will never fall in love again.

756
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:09,593
But I will love you, if that is your desire.

757
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:51,663
How do you do?

758
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:57,860
- Miss Webster.
- Hello.

759
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:02,978
- Mr. Nakamura, how nice of you to come.
- It is a great pleasure.

760
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,898
And may I say that you look
especially beautiful today.

761
01:12:06,018 --> 01:12:08,579
I haven’t been
to this month’s kabuki programme.

762
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,298
I know. You see, I have been waiting.

763
01:12:11,418 --> 01:12:14,856
- Eileen.
- Mother, you remember Mr. Nakamura.

764
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:17,575
- How do you do, Mrs. Webster?
- Yes, of course.

765
01:12:17,695 --> 01:12:20,134
This party isn’t given especially for you.

766
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:24,014
You’ve got to circulate around
and cement Japanese-American relations.

767
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:27,773
That’s exactly what
Mr. Nakamura and I are doing.

768
01:12:27,893 --> 01:12:32,972
Nakamura-san, my little girl wants
your autograph. She admires you so.

769
01:12:33,092 --> 01:12:37,650
- Of course. Will you please excuse me?
- Yes, of course.

770
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,809
Has Lloyd come yet?

771
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:44,568
How many weeks
are you gonna keep on pretending?

772
01:12:44,688 --> 01:12:48,807
- Lloyd is not coming.
- I’m absolutely furious at him.

773
01:12:48,927 --> 01:12:52,925
How can he ignore the general’s
invitation? I had it delivered to his office.

774
01:12:53,045 --> 01:12:57,204
I’m stuck with that Farrington woman.
Can you help me out?

775
01:12:58,724 --> 01:13:03,603
Uh-oh. There’s Crawford. Whenever
he shows up, there’s always something.

776
01:13:03,723 --> 01:13:06,482
Can I speak to you alone
for a minute, General?

777
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:11,681
Major, do you have that list with you?
I want to see if the Williams have come.

778
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:13,200
Yes, they have.

779
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,119
Waiter. Could you leave?

780
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:25,477
The reason I took this up with you
is because it concerns Major Gruver.

781
01:13:25,598 --> 01:13:29,037
We think he’s hooked
onto a Japanese dame.

782
01:13:29,157 --> 01:13:31,836
I’m sorry, but this thing’s
gotten me all riled up.

783
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:34,717
Do you realize what it’ll mean
to the enlisted men

784
01:13:34,836 --> 01:13:37,874
if they find out that their big hero,
Ace Gruver, is out with...

785
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:42,313
I’ve known Major Gruver all his life.
I’m a close friend of his father’s.

786
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:45,712
- I assure you, you must be wrong.
- He was seen going into that house.

787
01:13:45,832 --> 01:13:48,990
My men have been watching
a troublemaker named Kelly.

788
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:53,591
- He’s shacked up with another native...
- Kelly’s married to a Japanese girl.

789
01:13:53,711 --> 01:13:57,751
Major Gruver was the best man. It seems
quite natural to me that he’d visit them.

790
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:00,828
- How am I gonna handle the situation?
- Don’t handle it.

791
01:14:00,948 --> 01:14:03,387
I trust Major Gruver implicitly.

792
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:06,428
Is it all right with you if I post an order

793
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:12,065
to keep these officers from being seen
with indigenous personnel?

794
01:14:12,185 --> 01:14:14,466
If they are seen,
there’s something we can do.

795
01:14:14,586 --> 01:14:15,706
All right.

796
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,539
Lloyd.

797
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:03,133
No one saw you come?

798
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:08,092
No, there’s no military personnel
around here. Except me.

799
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:13,810
- We must go to the tea ceremony.
- Yeah, I know.

800
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:16,890
Good afternoon.

801
01:15:22,248 --> 01:15:25,807
All this getting up and down like to kill me.

802
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,239
He makes such a production
of everything.

803
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,758
The pleasure does not lie in the end itself.

804
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:07,997
It’s the pleasurable steps to that end.

805
01:16:08,117 --> 01:16:10,076
I see.

806
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,349
- That you, Ace?
- Yeah, Kelly.

807
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:43,389
- Come on in here.
- I can’t right now.

808
01:16:44,908 --> 01:16:48,027
He’d be surprised you come in this way.

809
01:16:48,147 --> 01:16:50,426
He’d faint.

810
01:16:50,546 --> 01:16:54,346
Just a little lower, Katsumi.
You always seem to be a little above it.

811
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:56,665
Yeah, that’s it. Yeah, yeah.

812
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,461
Kelly-san, now you get in tub?

813
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:11,540
OK, all right.

814
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:16,939
- Is Hana-ogi coming over tonight?
- Yeah, if she can get away.

815
01:17:17,059 --> 01:17:23,019
We gonna cook up some fine St Louis
goulash with a little Memphis greens.

816
01:17:26,697 --> 01:17:30,696
What are you doing tonight after dinner
when Hana-ogi goes back to the theatre?

817
01:17:30,816 --> 01:17:32,175
" Nothing.

818
01:17:32,295 --> 01:17:34,774
How about playing poker
with Katsumi and me?

819
01:17:34,894 --> 01:17:39,134
" I’d be delighted
to take your money, and your pants.

820
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:43,891
This is the life, ain’t it, Ace?

821
01:18:20,243 --> 01:18:22,203
There you are.

822
01:18:27,081 --> 01:18:29,041
How d’you do?

823
01:18:41,358 --> 01:18:43,677
I got one word for you.

824
01:18:43,798 --> 01:18:46,156
- What is that?
- Food.

825
01:18:58,793 --> 01:19:03,232
# Sayonara

826
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:07,632
# Japanese goodbye

827
01:19:07,752 --> 01:19:12,469
# Whisper “Sayonara”

828
01:19:12,589 --> 01:19:16,468
# Lover, don’t you cry

829
01:19:17,668 --> 01:19:22,307
# No more we stop to see

830
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:25,946
# Pretty cherry blossom

831
01:19:27,186 --> 01:19:31,906
# No more we ‘neath the tree

832
01:19:32,025 --> 01:19:35,544
# Looking at the sky

833
01:19:36,545 --> 01:19:41,063
# Sayonara

834
01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:46,261
# Sayonara

835
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:51,140
# Goodbye

836
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:57,298
That’s the cutest thing I ever saw, honey.

837
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,377
I must go.

838
01:20:00,778 --> 01:20:03,657
Ooh! Good eatin’.

839
01:20:05,296 --> 01:20:06,256
Bye-bye.

840
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:09,695
Are you going back
to the officers’ quarters tonight?

841
01:20:09,815 --> 01:20:12,895
No, I think I’m gonna just
fool around here.

842
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:15,214
What will you do all evening?

843
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:18,814
What am I gonna do?
I’m gonna get some beer, pretzels, girls.

844
01:20:18,934 --> 01:20:21,172
I’m gonna have a little fun for a change.

845
01:20:21,293 --> 01:20:24,332
Good. I don’t like you to be lonely.

846
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:32,131
Take care.

847
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:57,003
Come on in, Katsumi.

848
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:04,482
I’m sorry, Lloyd.
I had to come. It’s important.

849
01:21:04,602 --> 01:21:06,561
Hello, Eileen.

850
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:12,320
How are you?

851
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:14,959
Sit down, will you?

852
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:19,758
I’ll take this stuff out the way.
I was just gettin’ a little...

853
01:21:28,561 --> 01:21:30,316
Sit down here.

854
01:21:34,254 --> 01:21:35,628
How are you?

855
01:21:44,178 --> 01:21:47,737
- They’re after you, Lloyd.
- Who’s after me?

856
01:21:47,857 --> 01:21:51,536
There’s a colonel. His name’s Crawford.

857
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,616
Oh, yeah.

858
01:21:55,054 --> 01:21:57,095
I know him.

859
01:21:57,215 --> 01:22:00,612
He’s the one that’s riding Kelly.
This is Kelly’s house.

860
01:22:00,732 --> 01:22:02,691
Yes, I know.

861
01:22:04,691 --> 01:22:09,168
- You want to hear this, don’t you, Lloyd?
- Yeah, sure. Course I do.

862
01:22:09,288 --> 01:22:14,726
I overheard Colonel Crawford say
that he’s been having this house watched,

863
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:19,925
hoping to catch Kelly
at something irregular, I suppose.

864
01:22:20,044 --> 01:22:22,483
Anyhow, that’s how I knew where it was.

865
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:27,922
Well, then they... they’ve seen me
coming in and out of here.

866
01:22:28,042 --> 01:22:30,001
Yes.

867
01:22:31,881 --> 01:22:34,719
I just felt that I had to tell you...

868
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:41,877
Eileen...

869
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:45,434
There’s something that I feel that...

870
01:22:45,554 --> 01:22:53,032
I must go, Lloyd. I just wanted to warn you
to be particularly careful about...

871
01:22:53,152 --> 01:22:55,111
About what, honey?

872
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:02,028
About sticking strictly
to military regulations.

873
01:23:02,148 --> 01:23:05,188
Lloyd, they’ll do anything
to hang something on you,

874
01:23:05,307 --> 01:23:07,267
to keep you in line.

875
01:23:09,586 --> 01:23:14,024
After all, you’re the air force’s
pin-up boy, you know.

876
01:23:16,064 --> 01:23:20,222
Colonel Crawford sounded
as if he was after blood.

877
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:30,258
- More than anything I could think of...
- I must go now, Lloyd. Good luck.

878
01:23:30,378 --> 01:23:33,216
Wait a minute. Let me help you.

879
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:37,415
Eileen, I know...

880
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:44,053
Lloyd, you’ve really thought seriously
about what you’re doing, haven’t you?

881
01:23:46,453 --> 01:23:48,811
Yes, I...

882
01:23:48,931 --> 01:23:50,851
I think I have.

883
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:52,930
I hope so.

884
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:59,248
You’ve a brilliant record in the air force.
People depend upon you.

885
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:04,925
Before you throw all that you’ve worked
for away, be sure. Please be sure.

886
01:24:08,203 --> 01:24:14,801
Eileen, I don’t think if I had a million years
that I could tell you how all this happened.

887
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,399
I’d better go before I lose all my charm.

888
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:51,267
Do you like this old curious play?

889
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:56,386
Yeah, I’m beginning to get a kick out of it.

890
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,503
- See the rope between the rocks?
- Yeah.

891
01:25:05,623 --> 01:25:08,902
That is a Shinto sign
showing they are married.

892
01:25:09,022 --> 01:25:11,021
- What, the rocks?
- Yes.

893
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:15,259
They’ve been together so long, our people
thought it was time they got married.

894
01:25:15,379 --> 01:25:20,778
- They look well together, don’t you think?
- Yeah. Make a handsome little couple.

895
01:25:20,898 --> 01:25:22,737
Do you like my country?

896
01:25:22,857 --> 01:25:26,695
Yeah, was all these funny things here
before when I came through Japan?

897
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:28,775
Yes.

898
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:41,289
- Well, hello.
- Hello there, double-double ugly.

899
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:43,929
To what do we owe
the honor of this visit?

900
01:25:44,049 --> 01:25:48,887
Laundry. Gonna put down the dirties
and pick up the cleans.

901
01:25:52,206 --> 01:25:54,924
I hope you know what you’re doing.

902
01:25:55,044 --> 01:25:57,404
This came in.
Thought you might like to see it.

903
01:25:57,524 --> 01:26:01,882
”This is a routine reminder of
the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe:”

904
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:05,441
”Any public display of affection

is forbidden.”

906
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,519
”Officers should not even
appear on public streets

907
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:14,076
accompanied by indigenous
female personnel.”

908
01:26:14,196 --> 01:26:18,035
- Hooray for Christmas.
- This is serious. Everybody got one.

909
01:26:18,156 --> 01:26:21,834
Listen, fool, Hana-ogi and I
are just as careful as we can be.

910
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:25,833
We never go anyplace where we’re gonna
be seen by anybody that matters.

911
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:28,712
We don’t even walk down the same street.

912
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:32,111
We just go out in the country
and fool around.

913
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:35,749
You’ve never been to the country
around here, have you?

914
01:26:35,869 --> 01:26:38,989
Awful pretty country round here. I mean it.

915
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:43,787
You know what I saw yesterday?
I saw two rocks that just got married.

916
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:47,225
- You what?
- I saw two rocks that got married.

917
01:26:47,345 --> 01:26:50,784
- And they looked very happy together too.
- I’ll bet they did.

918
01:26:50,904 --> 01:26:56,220
They did. If you were gonna be smart,
I’ll tell you what you’d do.

919
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,660
You’d get your shoes shined
and go out tonight,

920
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,498
cos tonight is gonna be Tanabata.

921
01:27:02,299 --> 01:27:04,257
OK, what’s Tanabata?

922
01:27:05,336 --> 01:27:09,175
You’re gonna sit there and tell me
you don’t know what Tanabata is?

923
01:27:09,296 --> 01:27:10,695
Yeah.

924
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:13,054
My word, boy. I’m ashamed of you.

925
01:27:13,174 --> 01:27:15,734
I thought everybody knew
what Tanabata was.

926
01:27:15,854 --> 01:27:18,413
Tanabata is the night of love.

927
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:20,851
You told me all about it one time.

928
01:27:20,971 --> 01:27:26,050
You were telling me about Harry Truman
and New York Yankees and sex,

929
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,129
and New York Yankees
and Harry Truman and sex.

930
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:50,880
What have I done
to deserve such happiness?

931
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,278
I have seen this night of Tanabata
come and go many times,

932
01:27:56,398 --> 01:28:00,437
but never before
have I understood what it meant.

933
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:03,915
Tanabata.

934
01:28:04,035 --> 01:28:06,995
My heart is so full of love for you.

935
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:51,298
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?

936
01:28:51,418 --> 01:28:55,336
Nakamura-san get your note.
Here is reply.

937
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:59,335
He wishes if you will have dinner
with him and his guests.

938
01:28:59,455 --> 01:29:01,414
Thank you very much.

939
01:29:29,804 --> 01:29:34,762
They have a rather pleasant
garden here, Miss Webster.

940
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:39,761
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes, I think I would.

941
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,591
How beautiful.

942
01:30:13,467 --> 01:30:16,307
What are you really afraid of,
Miss Webster?

943
01:30:16,427 --> 01:30:21,984
You don’t think it would enter Major
Gruver’s mind to marry a Japanese girl?

944
01:30:23,664 --> 01:30:25,623
I don’t know.

945
01:30:25,742 --> 01:30:28,261
Then permit me to reassure you.

946
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:33,659
I think Major Gruver is brave,
but not brave enough to face the censure

947
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:36,498
that would result from such a marriage.

948
01:30:36,618 --> 01:30:40,537
As for our famous, honored Hana-ogi,

949
01:30:40,657 --> 01:30:44,456
there are many Japanese -
most of them, in fact -

950
01:30:44,575 --> 01:30:46,775
who look upon marriage to an Occidental

951
01:30:46,896 --> 01:30:50,934
with as much distaste
as your people do to one of us.

952
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:54,613
I do not feel that way,

953
01:30:54,732 --> 01:30:58,132
but then I have had the privilege
of traveling in your country

954
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:01,890
and knowing some great people there.

955
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:05,689
And I am especially conscious
at this moment

956
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:10,726
that beauty is not confined
to any one race.

957
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:16,403
Do not turn away, Miss Webster.

958
01:31:16,523 --> 01:31:21,563
I am not necessarily making love to you.

959
01:31:24,681 --> 01:31:29,239
I am only stating a very obvious fact.

960
01:31:31,517 --> 01:31:34,157
May I see you again, Miss Webster,

961
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:37,876
and acquaint you with more Japan?

962
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,634
Of course.

963
01:31:40,754 --> 01:31:45,154
I need to know more, much more,
about everything.

964
01:32:05,345 --> 01:32:07,304
There she is.

965
01:32:09,144 --> 01:32:11,102
Hello, honey.

966
01:32:22,659 --> 01:32:24,619
Are you tired?

967
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:31,654
No, I just been lying here
thinking about myself.

968
01:32:32,774 --> 01:32:35,413
I can’t believe I’m really here.

969
01:32:36,373 --> 01:32:40,452
It’s hard to believe
me being the same Lloyd Gruver

970
01:32:40,572 --> 01:32:44,531
that came over from Korea
just a little bit ago.

971
01:32:47,049 --> 01:32:52,807
I’ve been thinking
that all my life I’ve been so busy...

972
01:32:53,727 --> 01:32:56,567
snapping to and giving orders
and taking orders

973
01:32:56,686 --> 01:33:01,924
and being a general’s son
and doing the job and all that,

974
01:33:02,044 --> 01:33:05,802
I just never took time
to sit right down and...

975
01:33:07,122 --> 01:33:11,281
you know, think about
what my reason for living is.

976
01:33:13,799 --> 01:33:17,678
And I’ve been spending
some afternoons here just...

977
01:33:17,798 --> 01:33:22,236
bein’ peaceful and easy and thinking.

978
01:33:24,836 --> 01:33:27,795
And I believe for the first time I...

979
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:34,792
I’m just beginning to understand
what it’s all about,

980
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:40,230
what I really am and what I really want.

981
01:33:40,350 --> 01:33:42,309
It’s a nice feeling.

982
01:33:51,186 --> 01:33:53,505
Come on in.

983
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:56,423
Ace, excuse me. I hate to bother you.

984
01:33:56,543 --> 01:33:59,542
- I just got the news.
- You got what news?

985
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:03,661
- I’m gettin’ shipped back.
- You’re being shipped back where?

986
01:34:03,781 --> 01:34:07,620
Stateside. I’ve been reassigned
to a new duty station.

987
01:34:09,659 --> 01:34:12,178
Well...

988
01:34:12,297 --> 01:34:14,657
- Did you tell Katsumi yet?
- No.

989
01:34:14,777 --> 01:34:17,375
Don’t tell her.
Maybe we can work something out.

990
01:34:17,496 --> 01:34:20,775
What reason did they give you for it?

991
01:34:20,895 --> 01:34:24,214
No reason. But I know what it is.

992
01:34:24,334 --> 01:34:28,572
Every guy on that list
is married to a Japanese girl.

993
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:36,049
I’m sorry, Major.
There’s nothing you can do.

994
01:34:38,368 --> 01:34:43,406
We’re sending Kelly to the States
Thursday, and that’s that.

995
01:34:44,285 --> 01:34:46,965
What about his wife, Colonel?

996
01:34:47,085 --> 01:34:49,043
She stays here.

997
01:34:49,924 --> 01:34:53,683
He knew he couldn’t take her back
with him when he married her.

998
01:34:53,803 --> 01:34:56,361
- Didn’t you?
- That’s right.

999
01:34:57,761 --> 01:34:59,920
You’d be busting up his home, then.

1000
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,400
I’m not busting up anything.

1001
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,317
Though I admit Kelly’s been
a pain in my side for quite a while now.

1002
01:35:08,437 --> 01:35:12,555
Could you tell me why he didn’t have
the privilege of extending his tour of duty?

1003
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:18,074
Don’t ask me, Major. There are lots
of reasons for these things.

1004
01:35:18,193 --> 01:35:23,671
Anyway, it is an order
and there’s nothing you can do about it,

1005
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:27,189
even if you are a four-star general’s son.

1006
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:29,269
Yeah, well...

1007
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:38,026
Would it make any difference if I told you
my wife’s gonna have a baby?

1008
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,025
That’s tough, I admit.

1009
01:35:42,984 --> 01:35:47,062
Colonel, under these circumstances,
don’t you think that you’d be able to

1010
01:35:47,182 --> 01:35:49,942
postpone this for a little while?

1011
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:53,062
Maybe I could be transferred
back to Korea.

1012
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:55,139
No, you’re going home.

1013
01:35:57,339 --> 01:36:00,578
All the boys on this list are going home.

1014
01:36:01,737 --> 01:36:05,415
- Where is your home?
- That house by the canal.

1015
01:36:06,495 --> 01:36:09,533
- I mean your real home.
- That house by the canal.

1016
01:36:09,654 --> 01:36:11,612
Yeah, all right.

1017
01:36:13,252 --> 01:36:17,650
I’ve taken all the insubordination
from you I intend to.

1018
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:20,529
Now, you listen to me, wise guy.

1019
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:25,008
That house by the canal
is off limits from now on.

1020
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:28,687
Whole street’s off limits.

1021
01:36:28,807 --> 01:36:31,406
Do you want a court martial?

1022
01:36:31,526 --> 01:36:33,684
Does that mean I could stay in Japan?

1023
01:36:33,804 --> 01:36:37,963
You’re shipping outta here on Thursday.
And don’t you try to help him.

1024
01:36:40,203 --> 01:36:45,440
Remember that house by the canal
is off limits to all personnel.

1025
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:50,998
Would you tell me just exactly
what you mean by that last remark?

1026
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:54,316
That’s all I’m prepared
to say at the minute.

1027
01:36:54,436 --> 01:36:57,076
Except you watch your step.

1028
01:37:01,714 --> 01:37:05,792
I don’t know what else to tell you,
General. I’ve known this boy a long time.

1029
01:37:05,912 --> 01:37:10,550
If he has to go back without Katsumi,
he’s gonna be in trouble.

1030
01:37:10,671 --> 01:37:13,270
That’s about it. That’s it.

1031
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:15,829
- What about his wife?
- I don’t know.

1032
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:17,548
And the baby?

1033
01:37:19,508 --> 01:37:24,185
So the army lets them get married and
then forces them to desert their wives.

1034
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,985
That’s not fair, Eileen.

1035
01:37:27,105 --> 01:37:30,463
A boy away from home
for the first time, lonesome,

1036
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:33,062
often falls in love
with the first girl he touches,

1037
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:36,061
in most cases with a girl from the streets.

1038
01:37:36,181 --> 01:37:42,020
It’s up to the service in some measure
to be fathers and mothers to these boys

1039
01:37:42,139 --> 01:37:44,977
and try to head off these marriages.

1040
01:37:45,097 --> 01:37:47,417
But after they’re married,
why send them home?

1041
01:37:47,537 --> 01:37:51,056
He’s being transferred to a new
duty station, along with many others.

1042
01:37:51,136 --> 01:37:55,775
Don’t ask me the reasons for changes
of duty. There are thousands of them.

1043
01:37:55,894 --> 01:37:59,733
But Lloyd said most of the men on this list
are married to Japanese girls.

1044
01:37:59,853 --> 01:38:04,691
- That can’t be just a coincidence.
- Why not? It could easily be.

1045
01:38:04,811 --> 01:38:10,208
Frankly, with some of these men,
I think they might welcome the transfer.

1046
01:38:10,328 --> 01:38:12,088
Why’s that, sir?

1047
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:15,566
There have been unfortunate aftermaths
to many of these marriages.

1048
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:18,046
Recriminations, regrets.

1049
01:38:19,325 --> 01:38:23,803
A boy gets married impulsively, then feels
caught, doesn’t know how to get out of it.

1050
01:38:23,923 --> 01:38:28,682
Change of duty gives them both
a chance to think it over, to cool off.

1051
01:38:28,802 --> 01:38:33,881
I don’t mean to imply that’s the reason
these men are being transferred but...

1052
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,598
well, the whole thing’s a messy business.

1053
01:38:41,438 --> 01:38:45,876
General Webster, there is no regret
in the case of Kelly and Katsumi.

1054
01:38:45,996 --> 01:38:48,115
You can have my word on that.

1055
01:38:48,234 --> 01:38:54,432
Lloyd, three officers came to me today
with identical requests for their men.

1056
01:38:54,552 --> 01:38:58,630
It’s not our policy to interfere with
decisions made by commanding officers.

1057
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:04,469
The basic structure of the military service
would collapse if we did things like that.

1058
01:39:04,589 --> 01:39:08,027
Your father would understand that,
even if you don’t.

1059
01:39:08,147 --> 01:39:15,184
You’re asking me to make an exception of
Kelly when I’ve refused these other men?

1060
01:39:15,304 --> 01:39:17,943
I am gonna ask you to do that, sir.

1061
01:39:19,343 --> 01:39:24,102
You made an exception of me
when you brought me from Korea.

1062
01:39:24,982 --> 01:39:28,741
I’m afraid it’s a hopeless situation, Lloyd.

1063
01:39:33,058 --> 01:39:35,017
Well...

1064
01:39:36,257 --> 01:39:39,095
That’s the end of Joe Kelly.

1065
01:39:39,215 --> 01:39:42,534
You told me yourself that Kelly’s
past record was against him.

1066
01:39:42,654 --> 01:39:44,414
I couldn’t even use that.

1067
01:39:44,533 --> 01:39:47,132
Why does this mean
so much to you, Lloyd?

1068
01:39:49,092 --> 01:39:53,411
Kelly’s from my outfit, Mrs. Webster,
I was his best man,

1069
01:39:53,531 --> 01:39:57,449
and I’m planning to marry
a Japanese girl myself.

1070
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:05,646
Come into the other room, Eileen. This is
something for your father to handle.

1071
01:40:05,765 --> 01:40:09,965
No, Mrs. Webster. I don’t think
this is anything for anybody to handle.

1072
01:40:15,522 --> 01:40:17,481
I’m sorry, Eileen.

1073
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:24,958
Mrs. Webster. Good afternoon.

1074
01:40:31,436 --> 01:40:36,234
I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone again
as much as I love Lloyd.

1075
01:40:36,354 --> 01:40:39,953
But I’ll tell you something
that’s rather ironic.

1076
01:40:40,073 --> 01:40:43,232
I once asked Lloyd
if he ever felt like grabbing me

1077
01:40:43,352 --> 01:40:47,309
and hauling me off to a shack somewhere.

1078
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:52,428
That’s just what he’s done, isn’t it?
Only it’s with somebody else.

1079
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,626
Don’t go out, Eileen. Stay and talk.

1080
01:40:55,746 --> 01:40:59,664
I’m sorry, Mother. There’s only one
person I’d like to talk to at the moment.

1081
01:40:59,784 --> 01:41:02,624
And, oddly enough, he’s Japanese.

1082
01:41:06,582 --> 01:41:09,901
- Ace, I’ve been waiting for you.
- Kelly, listen.

1083
01:41:10,021 --> 01:41:14,499
I just came from General Webster’s
house. There’s a whole big mess there.

1084
01:41:14,619 --> 01:41:19,417
- No good, huh?
- No. He didn’t go for it.

1085
01:41:19,537 --> 01:41:23,616
Matter of fact, I think
I even messed it up a little.

1086
01:41:23,736 --> 01:41:25,736
That figures.

1087
01:41:25,855 --> 01:41:27,894
Did you tell Katsumi yet?

1088
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:31,533
I’m chickening out fast.

1089
01:41:31,653 --> 01:41:35,212
Besides, she’s got her heart set
on something she planned for us tonight.

1090
01:41:35,332 --> 01:41:40,569
Wants us to take the train over to Osaka
and meet the girls at the puppet show.

1091
01:41:40,689 --> 01:41:42,649
Why spoil it?

1092
01:41:44,328 --> 01:41:48,606
Maybe I’ll tell her late tonight
when we’re alone.

1093
01:41:48,726 --> 01:41:52,924
Listen, Kelly, don’t give up on it.
I think there’s gonna be a way out of it.

1094
01:41:53,044 --> 01:41:55,404
You think so? I don’t.

1095
01:41:57,324 --> 01:41:59,963
- I’ll see you, Ace.
- Kelly-san.

1096
01:42:01,043 --> 01:42:04,800
Tell Katsumi we’ll be there with bells.

1097
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,880
Were you able to help?

1098
01:42:09,919 --> 01:42:12,558
- No.
- How terrible.

1099
01:42:16,957 --> 01:42:20,234
I know it’s hard, honey,
but it’s not gonna last long.

1100
01:42:20,354 --> 01:42:24,913
The army’s gotta change that law
next year, or the next one.

1101
01:42:25,033 --> 01:42:27,991
It just has to be. I’m sure of it.

1102
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:34,389
And, in fact, I’m so sure of it
that I went downtown today

1103
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:39,588
and I signed some papers here that mean
that you and I are gonna get married.

1104
01:42:42,346 --> 01:42:45,586
- What’s the matter?
- We never spoke of marriage.

1105
01:42:45,706 --> 01:42:49,064
I know we didn’t, darling.
I know we didn’t.

1106
01:42:49,185 --> 01:42:55,702
I’ve been going round and round with that
every day for a long time.

1107
01:42:55,821 --> 01:43:00,220
I didn’t feel I could
speak about it until now.

1108
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,299
But now I can.

1109
01:43:03,498 --> 01:43:06,697
Now, of course, I won’t be able
to take you back to America,

1110
01:43:06,817 --> 01:43:10,816
but they’re bound to change
that ridiculous law soon.

1111
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:14,174
Until then I’m gonna stay here with you.

1112
01:43:15,614 --> 01:43:18,493
I’m not stuck in the air force. I can resign.

1113
01:43:18,613 --> 01:43:23,931
Course, I’m not trained to do
anything else, but I’d find something.

1114
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:27,650
We never spoke of marriage.

1115
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:32,089
I know we didn’t, darling,
but we’re speaking of it now.

1116
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:42,563
Do you remember
the first night we talked?

1117
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:47,242
I said there would be danger
of weakness when it is over.

1118
01:43:49,641 --> 01:43:52,361
Over? What are you talking about?

1119
01:43:55,240 --> 01:44:00,957
I’m tempted. With you, I could become
and woman and a mother,

1120
01:44:01,077 --> 01:44:03,037
and I could love you.

1121
01:44:04,596 --> 01:44:06,635
That’s right.

1122
01:44:06,756 --> 01:44:09,314
Do you think I haven’t thought about it?

1123
01:44:09,434 --> 01:44:14,553
Do you think I want to become a lonely
old woman who teaches dancing,

1124
01:44:14,673 --> 01:44:17,032
now that I have known you?

1125
01:44:18,471 --> 01:44:20,950
But it is no good.

1126
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:26,508
- You must know it too.
- No. I don’t know anything of the kind.

1127
01:44:27,747 --> 01:44:31,226
The way you talk about
leaving the air force,

1128
01:44:31,346 --> 01:44:36,744
finding some pitiful way of earning living,
just to be here with your Japanese wife.

1129
01:44:36,863 --> 01:44:39,223
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1130
01:44:41,941 --> 01:44:46,621
I think we’re too far into this thing
to be talking like that.

1131
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:50,340
Matsubayashi has been kind to me, Lloyd.

1132
01:44:50,459 --> 01:44:54,858
- I am obligated to them.
- No, you ain’t. No, no.

1133
01:44:54,978 --> 01:44:56,977
You are obligated to me.

1134
01:44:58,257 --> 01:45:00,295
They are my life.

1135
01:45:00,415 --> 01:45:03,935
I would bring shame to them, disgrace.

1136
01:45:04,054 --> 01:45:06,094
Lloyd, you know what I mean.

1137
01:45:06,213 --> 01:45:09,732
Yeah, I think I’m beginning
to know what you mean.

1138
01:45:09,852 --> 01:45:13,370
I think you mean you simply don’t
love me enough to go on through with it.

1139
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:17,968
That’s what you mean, don’t you? Why
don’t you just come on out and say it?

1140
01:45:18,089 --> 01:45:20,047
It is not what I mean.

1141
01:45:24,646 --> 01:45:30,084
I’m leaving for Tokyo in six days.
Matsubayashi are sending me.

1142
01:45:30,203 --> 01:45:32,322
You what?

1143
01:45:33,922 --> 01:45:38,081
With another troupe.
They have found out about us.

1144
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:42,918
Any other girl they would have dismissed,
but because they like me,

1145
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:47,438
because they feel I am important to them,
they are being lenient.

1146
01:45:48,435 --> 01:45:51,554
Well, I’m not gonna be lenient with you.

1147
01:45:51,675 --> 01:45:56,673
I want you to tell me why Matsubayashi
means more to you than I do.

1148
01:45:58,912 --> 01:46:04,310
Lloyd, there is something about myself
I have not told you.

1149
01:46:04,431 --> 01:46:07,549
I have no right to marry anyone.

1150
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:10,668
My father was very poor.

1151
01:46:10,788 --> 01:46:15,906
To save his other children,
he was forced to sell one of his daughters.

1152
01:46:17,426 --> 01:46:21,945
The man from
the houses of Yoshiwara came to him.

1153
01:46:22,064 --> 01:46:27,262
Because I was the oldest,
he agreed I should go with him.

1154
01:46:29,541 --> 01:46:32,100
Your father sold you?

1155
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:39,097
Yes, but I was saved from starting this life
by my best friend, Fumiko-san.

1156
01:46:41,816 --> 01:46:44,456
Her father paid money to free me.

1157
01:46:45,615 --> 01:46:48,654
Then she brought me to Matsubayashi.

1158
01:46:51,293 --> 01:46:57,531
There I not only earned my living,
I brought honor back to my family.

1159
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:03,530
Matsubayashi has been kind to me.

1160
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:06,128
They have trusted me.

1161
01:47:06,967 --> 01:47:11,526
I cannot leave them.
I cannot marry anyone.

1162
01:47:15,325 --> 01:47:17,283
Don’t you understand?

1163
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:25,840
I don’t know.

1164
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:30,278
I don’t know what to think.

1165
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:36,956
I’ll kill you! You ever do anything like this
and I’ll kill you, you understand?

1166
01:47:37,076 --> 01:47:41,834
- Wait a minute. Just take it easy, now.
- Ace, look at this.

1167
01:47:43,074 --> 01:47:45,113
- It fell out of her bag.
- What is it?

1168
01:47:45,233 --> 01:47:49,832
She was gonna have it done tomorrow,
by that quack doctor down by the docks.

1169
01:47:49,951 --> 01:47:53,750
For eight bucks he slashes her eyelids
and sews ‘em back up again.

1170
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:58,948
Lots of these stupid little jerks
have it done. She was gonna surprise me.

1171
01:47:59,068 --> 01:48:04,266
Then... then I have good eyes,
I fool everybody.

1172
01:48:04,386 --> 01:48:08,065
I look American, like Joe.

1173
01:48:08,184 --> 01:48:13,422
Hana-ogi, will you tell that stupid dame
I love her the way she is?

1174
01:48:13,542 --> 01:48:17,861
I don’t want her changed. Will you tell her
I love her mouth and her nose

1175
01:48:17,982 --> 01:48:21,699
and her ears and her eyes
just the way they are?

1176
01:48:21,821 --> 01:48:26,899
Tell her if she ever does
anything like that, I’ll...

1177
01:48:27,018 --> 01:48:30,657
I want him be proud of me.

1178
01:48:30,777 --> 01:48:32,416
I’m sorry.

1179
01:48:32,535 --> 01:48:35,335
If you want him to be proud of you,
quit this stuff.

1180
01:48:35,455 --> 01:48:41,051
You’re making him very unhappy.
Tell him you’re not gonna do it any more.

1181
01:48:41,171 --> 01:48:43,771
- Tell him that.
- Joe.

1182
01:48:45,611 --> 01:48:47,330
I’m so sorry.

1183
01:48:50,329 --> 01:48:53,088
We’re gonna forget about that.

1184
01:48:53,209 --> 01:48:58,486
I thought we were gonna have a fish fry,
have some fun and dancing and yelling.

1185
01:48:58,606 --> 01:49:01,245
And what do I find?
So what’s gonna happen to us?

1186
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:03,444
- Puppet show.
- We had a surprise.

1187
01:49:03,564 --> 01:49:06,563
- You like?
- Sure I do. I’ve been looking forward to it.

1188
01:49:06,683 --> 01:49:09,803
- Everybody tonight?
- Yeah.

1189
01:49:14,441 --> 01:49:16,400
We will be late.

1190
01:49:23,596 --> 01:49:25,076
Look.

1191
01:49:25,196 --> 01:49:27,915
The lover is leaving the city.

1192
01:49:28,035 --> 01:49:29,994
Walk to the wood.

1193
01:50:05,821 --> 01:50:09,419
Lloyd, don’t think of anything now.

1194
01:50:10,418 --> 01:50:12,578
Watch the play.

1195
01:50:12,698 --> 01:50:14,657
It’s a tender story.

1196
01:50:22,614 --> 01:50:26,372
When gong sound, it is dawn,

1197
01:50:26,492 --> 01:50:31,290
and then she will bind her body.

1198
01:50:32,211 --> 01:50:33,650
Bind her body?

1199
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:39,768
So that she will not fall in an ugly position
of dishonor when she dies.

1200
01:50:39,888 --> 01:50:42,725
- When she dies?
- Yes.

1201
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:05,398
It is custom for lovers to die together
when they can no longer face life.

1202
01:51:15,075 --> 01:51:17,434
It is so beautiful.

1203
01:51:18,154 --> 01:51:21,352
Beautiful? They’re gonna die, aren’t they?

1204
01:51:21,472 --> 01:51:25,989
They will live in another world
on a beautiful lake,

1205
01:51:26,109 --> 01:51:29,188
floating always together.

1206
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:31,268
Like water lily.

1207
01:51:33,826 --> 01:51:35,787
Sure.

1208
01:52:53,757 --> 01:52:57,397
" Kelly-san! Kelly-san! Kelly-san!

1209
01:53:06,593 --> 01:53:10,831
Something about soldiers
going through the house.

1210
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:17,430
- That’s the MPs, boy.
- What happened? What’s wrong?

1211
01:53:17,549 --> 01:53:20,188
- What happened?
- Get in the car.

1212
01:53:21,948 --> 01:53:26,146
- Please tell me.
- Go to Matsubayashi. I’ll tell you later.

1213
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:27,225
Matsubayashi.

1214
01:53:30,223 --> 01:53:32,423
Hey, Ed, look.

1215
01:53:47,178 --> 01:53:49,137
Look at that.

1216
01:53:51,892 --> 01:53:54,930
- You’re Major Gruver, aren’t you?
- That’s right.

1217
01:53:55,051 --> 01:53:57,729
You’ll have to come with us.
General Webster’s orders.

1218
01:53:57,849 --> 01:54:00,130
What right do you have
to board up this house?

1219
01:54:00,249 --> 01:54:02,448
He won’t be needing it. He’s shipping out.

1220
01:54:02,568 --> 01:54:04,287
Joe!

1221
01:54:04,407 --> 01:54:06,366
Come on, Major.

1222
01:54:08,207 --> 01:54:10,564
You’ll hear from me, Kelly.

1223
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,118
Come on, kid.
We’ll get in through the garden.

1224
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:28,918
I got something to tell you.

1225
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:54,227
You were seen in public with her tonight,
violating orders.

1226
01:54:54,347 --> 01:54:57,785
This has given me the right
to put you under arrest.

1227
01:54:57,905 --> 01:55:01,344
And for your own sake,
I think I better do it.

1228
01:55:01,464 --> 01:55:04,463
Well? Have you anything to say?

1229
01:55:06,423 --> 01:55:13,100
Just as soon as I’m out of this, I’m gonna
be married and have a house of my own.

1230
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:17,338
I’m afraid not.
I’m sorry, Lloyd, but it’s all settled.

1231
01:55:17,459 --> 01:55:20,937
The supervisor of the Matsubayashi
came to see me tonight.

1232
01:55:21,057 --> 01:55:26,097
The girl goes to Tokyo and you fly to
Randolph Field the day after tomorrow.

1233
01:55:26,217 --> 01:55:28,895
Here are your orders.

1234
01:55:29,014 --> 01:55:32,853
Until that time, you’re under house arrest.

1235
01:55:32,973 --> 01:55:37,612
You’re not to leave your quarters
until further notice.

1236
01:55:41,249 --> 01:55:44,648
I’m doing this because I feel
you’re not responsible at the moment.

1237
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:48,207
After all, I’ve known your father for years.

1238
01:55:52,765 --> 01:55:55,125
Well, that’s all.

1239
01:56:28,672 --> 01:56:30,632
Mike.

1240
01:56:30,751 --> 01:56:33,231
- Did you see her?
- I couldn’t get near the place.

1241
01:56:33,351 --> 01:56:36,430
They’ve really clamped down.
I couldn’t even see Fumiko-san.

1242
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:39,309
I’ve got to see her.
I’m being shipped out tomorrow.

1243
01:56:39,428 --> 01:56:41,908
- Major Gruver.
- What is it?

1244
01:56:42,028 --> 01:56:44,987
- Would you do something for us?
- What do you want?

1245
01:56:45,106 --> 01:56:48,065
- Airman Kelly’s disappeared.
- That’s impossible.

1246
01:56:48,186 --> 01:56:50,545
- I was with him just last night.
- We know.

1247
01:56:50,665 --> 01:56:55,662
A special plane came through and
Colonel Crawford told us to get him on it.

1248
01:56:55,782 --> 01:57:00,701
I took him to the airport at 12.50. When
the plane took off, Kelly wasn’t on it.

1249
01:57:00,821 --> 01:57:05,418
- We figured you might know where he is.
- His house has been boarded up.

1250
01:57:05,538 --> 01:57:06,498
We know.

1251
01:57:06,617 --> 01:57:10,336
Neighbors won’t talk to us.
We figure maybe they’re hiding him.

1252
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:13,696
They’ll talk with you, Major.
Would you help us?

1253
01:57:13,816 --> 01:57:17,574
Would you give me one good reason
why I should?

1254
01:57:18,494 --> 01:57:21,773
We figured we’d give him a break.
We haven’t reported him yet.

1255
01:57:21,893 --> 01:57:27,971
If we get him on another plane, we might
not have to turn him in for desertion.

1256
01:57:28,091 --> 01:57:30,049
- Desertion?
- Yes, sir.

1257
01:57:33,449 --> 01:57:35,408
Well...

1258
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:39,687
- I’ll go with you in a minute.
- Major.

1259
01:57:39,806 --> 01:57:42,086
The neighbors won’t talk
if they see an MP.

1260
01:57:42,205 --> 01:57:45,044
- I’ll go with him.
- Thank you, sir.

1261
01:58:42,903 --> 01:58:44,862
Kelly?

1262
01:58:47,222 --> 01:58:49,180
It’s Gruver out here.

1263
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,259
I think he’s in there.

1264
01:58:54,658 --> 01:58:56,617
Kelly?

1265
01:58:57,778 --> 01:58:59,736
I’m goin’ on in.

1266
01:59:12,931 --> 01:59:14,891
Kelly?

1267
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,047
Kelly?

1268
01:59:28,604 --> 01:59:31,164
Kelly? You in there?

1269
01:59:53,795 --> 01:59:55,754
Oh, my God!

1270
01:59:59,153 --> 02:00:01,113
Oh, my...

1271
02:00:20,466 --> 02:00:22,425
Oh...

1272
02:00:28,023 --> 02:00:30,181
I’ll call the police, Ace.

1273
02:00:46,936 --> 02:00:48,895
Oh, God!

1274
02:01:22,802 --> 02:01:25,841
" Sayonara, Kelly-san.

1275
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:32,959
Sayonara, Katsumi-san.

1276
02:01:42,474 --> 02:01:46,954
Sayonara, my Lloyd-san.

1277
02:02:21,541 --> 02:02:24,779
" Go home! Go home!

1278
02:02:30,138 --> 02:02:34,776
Ace, there’s no police around.
We better get outta here.

1279
02:02:35,456 --> 02:02:37,374
Hey, look.

1280
02:02:44,371 --> 02:02:46,931
Doesn’t look too good, boy.

1281
02:02:52,249 --> 02:02:54,048
Come on, take it easy.

1282
02:03:25,916 --> 02:03:27,955
We’re gettin’ help, Ace.

1283
02:03:40,551 --> 02:03:43,790
- You OK, boy?
- I’m fine. You all right?

1284
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:45,310
Yeah.

1285
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:49,748
I’m gonna... I want you
to take care of everything, will you?

1286
02:03:49,868 --> 02:03:52,268
Yeah, I’ll get it.

1287
02:03:52,387 --> 02:03:54,347
I’ll see you later.

1288
02:04:39,609 --> 02:04:41,808
- Where’s Hana-ogi?
- Hana-ogi is not here.

1289
02:04:41,928 --> 02:04:45,006
- I know she’s here.
- She is on her way Tokyo.

1290
02:04:45,125 --> 02:04:48,525
- She wasn’t going till next week.
- She went today.

1291
02:04:48,645 --> 02:04:53,683
- I don’t believe you.
- Major Gruver! It’s forbidden to go in.

1292
02:05:38,707 --> 02:05:40,665
Hana-ogi?

1293
02:05:49,903 --> 02:05:53,021
Hana-ogi? Hana-ogi?

1294
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:55,541
Hana-ogi?

1295
02:06:04,737 --> 02:06:06,695
Hana-ogi?

1296
02:06:12,933 --> 02:06:15,133
- Gruver-san!
- Where’s Hana-ogi?

1297
02:06:15,212 --> 02:06:16,971
- She’s gone.
- Where’s her room?

1298
02:06:17,092 --> 02:06:20,450
- She’s gone.
- Listen, where’s her room?

1299
02:06:20,570 --> 02:06:22,370
Come here.

1300
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:27,608
Hana-ogi really gone, Major.

1301
02:06:27,728 --> 02:06:29,688
I don’t believe you.

1302
02:06:30,327 --> 02:06:32,286
Hana-ogi?

1303
02:06:37,725 --> 02:06:42,403
I give you my word.
You go now too, Major.

1304
02:06:42,523 --> 02:06:44,762
It’s over.

1305
02:06:44,883 --> 02:06:47,601
Leave me alone a minute, will you?

1306
02:07:02,914 --> 02:07:06,314
The hoodlums who attacked you
weren’t all your Japanese neighbors.

1307
02:07:06,434 --> 02:07:09,073
They were troublemakers
sent to your street

1308
02:07:09,193 --> 02:07:11,912
to create an incident specifically with you.

1309
02:07:12,031 --> 02:07:15,071
If you’re important to those who hate us,

1310
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:18,549
don’t you see
how important you are to us?

1311
02:07:20,549 --> 02:07:23,707
Do you understand any of this, Lloyd?

1312
02:07:25,427 --> 02:07:27,466
I know how you feel.

1313
02:07:27,585 --> 02:07:28,986
It was...

1314
02:07:29,106 --> 02:07:34,742
It was dreadful about your friend Kelly
and... and his wife.

1315
02:07:36,743 --> 02:07:39,100
It must be hard to take.

1316
02:07:41,101 --> 02:07:45,339
And I... I hate to tell you something else,

1317
02:07:45,459 --> 02:07:49,578
because it’s almost too grotesque...

1318
02:07:52,377 --> 02:07:55,256
almost unforgivable
in your eyes, I imagine.

1319
02:07:55,375 --> 02:08:01,893
I got word today that there’s a law
being passed in a month or two

1320
02:08:02,013 --> 02:08:05,332
that will make it possible
for men like Kelly

1321
02:08:05,452 --> 02:08:09,491
to take their Japanese brides
back to the States.

1322
02:08:13,448 --> 02:08:18,886
- That can’t be true, General.
- Well, it happens to be true, Lloyd.

1323
02:08:23,325 --> 02:08:28,363
Listen, how do you get the guts
to come here and tell me that?

1324
02:08:28,483 --> 02:08:32,082
It takes time to get laws passed, Lloyd.

1325
02:08:32,202 --> 02:08:36,720
And a lot of people have died in this world
needlessly waiting for them.

1326
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:40,798
It’s harder to take
when it hits you personally.

1327
02:08:43,158 --> 02:08:45,077
Lloyd...

1328
02:08:45,197 --> 02:08:47,756
You’re lost. You’re confused.

1329
02:08:49,195 --> 02:08:52,913
Don’t you think it’s time you got back
to the mainstream of your life?

1330
02:08:53,033 --> 02:08:57,390
Back to your roots,
what you were born for and raised for.

1331
02:08:57,511 --> 02:09:04,349
You’ll feel better about everything when
you get back home, back to your work.

1332
02:09:04,469 --> 02:09:07,267
I appreciate you coming over, General.

1333
02:09:46,893 --> 02:09:49,251
Take me to the airport, Mike.

1334
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,809
That must be him.

1335
02:09:56,929 --> 02:10:02,368
- Hold it so we can get a picture, General.
- Where would you like me?

1336
02:10:02,847 --> 02:10:04,806
Smile, please.

1337
02:10:10,245 --> 02:10:14,084
- Bill, isn’t that Ace Gruver?
- Looks like him.

1338
02:10:16,722 --> 02:10:18,840
Sir.

1339
02:10:18,961 --> 02:10:21,200
Aren’t you Major Gruver? Ace Gruver?

1340
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:23,918
- That’s right.
- We’re from the "Stars and Stripes."

1341
02:10:24,039 --> 02:10:28,397
- What are you doing in Tokyo?
- I’m just passing through, boys.

1342
02:10:28,518 --> 02:10:31,796
- Just seeing the sights, huh?
- That’s right. I’m in a hurry.

1343
02:10:31,916 --> 02:10:36,555
- Do you mind if I excuse myself? Sorry.
- You’re excused.

1344
02:12:20,636 --> 02:12:22,796
It’s Gruver! Gruver-san!

1345
02:12:47,946 --> 02:12:49,265
Lloyd-san.

1346
02:12:50,785 --> 02:12:52,544
Hello.

1347
02:13:10,657 --> 02:13:12,896
Hello, Hana-ogi.

1348
02:13:15,096 --> 02:13:18,614
I’m goin’ back to America on Friday,

1349
02:13:18,734 --> 02:13:23,572
and I probably won’t
get back in Japan again.

1350
02:13:26,732 --> 02:13:29,490
And before I go, there was just...

1351
02:13:30,809 --> 02:13:33,369
just one thing I wanted to know.

1352
02:13:35,727 --> 02:13:38,886
You remember one time you said to me...

1353
02:13:40,846 --> 02:13:46,723
that you could love me
and be a wife and a mother?

1354
02:13:48,162 --> 02:13:50,481
I remember.

1355
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:54,200
You said that since you’d known me,

1356
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:59,678
you’d been afraid of being
a lonely old woman teaching dancing.

1357
02:13:59,798 --> 02:14:02,517
Remember that?

1358
02:14:02,637 --> 02:14:04,796
I remember.

1359
02:14:05,516 --> 02:14:09,555
Did you mean that
when you said it, Hana-ogi?

1360
02:14:10,474 --> 02:14:14,193
I meant it. It is already happening.

1361
02:14:14,313 --> 02:14:18,671
Life has gone out of my work, out of me.

1362
02:14:18,791 --> 02:14:21,550
Lloyd, please go now.

1363
02:14:21,670 --> 02:14:24,829
This will only bring pain and trouble.

1364
02:14:26,989 --> 02:14:30,866
Hana-ogi, you and I
are gonna have more trouble

1365
02:14:30,986 --> 02:14:33,505
than we ever thought
of having in our whole lives

1366
02:14:33,625 --> 02:14:37,664
unless you are absolutely
honest with yourself.

1367
02:14:38,943 --> 02:14:43,302
Please, Lloyd,
can’t we talk about this later?

1368
02:14:43,422 --> 02:14:49,180
No. There’s isn’t gonna be any later.
There’s only gonna be right now.

1369
02:14:51,059 --> 02:14:53,498
Excuse me, mother. Excuse me.

1370
02:14:57,417 --> 02:15:00,336
I must return this robe.

1371
02:15:00,456 --> 02:15:04,935
I wanna know -
do you love me or don’t you?

1372
02:15:06,093 --> 02:15:11,612
Because if you don’t, then I’m gonna
have to find a way to live with it.

1373
02:15:11,732 --> 02:15:14,250
- And if you do...
- Please, Lloyd.

1374
02:15:15,970 --> 02:15:18,328
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1375
02:15:21,408 --> 02:15:25,646
I don’t want you to tell me
anything more or anything less

1376
02:15:25,766 --> 02:15:29,245
than you feel
in the very deepest part of you.

1377
02:15:29,365 --> 02:15:35,603
Because what you answer to me now
is gonna affect us for the rest of our lives.

1378
02:15:36,442 --> 02:15:40,202
Do you love me, Hana-ogi,
or don’t you love me?

1379
02:15:42,921 --> 02:15:45,639
I’m so frightened and confused.

1380
02:15:45,759 --> 02:15:49,478
I cannot think.
I cannot even understand your thinking.

1381
02:15:49,597 --> 02:15:55,755
I’m not thinking. For the first time
in my life I’m not thinking and I don’t care.

1382
02:15:55,875 --> 02:15:57,834
But we must do the right thing.

1383
02:15:57,953 --> 02:16:00,353
What are you talking about,
the right thing?

1384
02:16:00,473 --> 02:16:03,432
We been wasting two good lives
trying to do the right thing -

1385
02:16:03,552 --> 02:16:07,271
the right thing for Matsubayashi,
the right thing for my father,

1386
02:16:07,391 --> 02:16:11,310
the right thing for the military,
the right thing for Japanese tradition,

1387
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:14,469
the right thing for the great white race.

1388
02:16:14,589 --> 02:16:19,827
- But we have duties and obligations.
- We do have duties and obligations.

1389
02:16:19,947 --> 02:16:23,025
The first obligation we have
is to love each other,

1390
02:16:23,145 --> 02:16:26,744
to become man and wife
and raise some clean, sweet children,

1391
02:16:26,864 --> 02:16:29,704
and give them the very best
that we know how.

1392
02:16:29,824 --> 02:16:34,981
And if we don’t meet that obligation,
we ain’t gonna be any good to anybody.

1393
02:16:35,101 --> 02:16:39,738
We live in different worlds,
come from different races.

1394
02:16:41,779 --> 02:16:45,136
Honey, I want you to be my wife.

1395
02:16:46,736 --> 02:16:50,455
But what would happen to our children?
What would they be?

1396
02:16:50,575 --> 02:16:54,413
What would they be?
They’d be half-Japanese, half-American.

1397
02:16:54,533 --> 02:16:57,292
They’d be half-yellow and half-white.

1398
02:16:57,412 --> 02:17:00,171
They’d be half you, they’d be half me.

1399
02:17:00,292 --> 02:17:03,610
That’s all they’re gonna be.

1400
02:17:15,166 --> 02:17:18,404
Hana-ogi, I want you
to come with me now.

1401
02:17:19,563 --> 02:17:24,242
I want you to come with me now
down to the American consulate.

1402
02:17:24,362 --> 02:17:27,281
Here in Tokyo. We’re gonna start
filling out those papers.

1403
02:17:27,401 --> 02:17:32,959
We’ve only got a few days to get
this whole thing done and out of the way.

1404
02:17:40,797 --> 02:17:42,756
Will you come?

1405
02:17:52,712 --> 02:17:55,271
I’m gonna wait for you outside.

1406
02:18:23,939 --> 02:18:26,018
Did I tell you they’d be here?

1407
02:18:26,138 --> 02:18:30,536
- Look at this crowd.
- Look who’s here. Our rivals.

1408
02:18:30,656 --> 02:18:36,215
You guys heard about it too?
No secrets. No secrets in this country.

1409
02:18:41,293 --> 02:18:43,971
Major, what a coincidence.

1410
02:18:44,091 --> 02:18:46,251
You got a story for us, sir?

1411
02:18:47,171 --> 02:18:49,250
No, as a matter of fact, I don’t.

1412
02:18:49,369 --> 02:18:53,008
- You’re not gonna try to deny it, are you?
- Deny what?

1413
02:18:53,129 --> 02:18:55,647
The story.
Why won’t you give us the story?

1414
02:18:55,767 --> 02:18:59,046
- You’re big news now, sir.
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.

1415
02:19:01,485 --> 02:19:04,524
Here’s Hana-ogi. Maybe she’ll talk.

1416
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:24,117
Come on, Hana-ogi.
That’s not fair. What did you say?

1417
02:19:24,237 --> 02:19:29,434
It is very difficult for a Japanese woman
to speak in public.

1418
02:19:29,554 --> 02:19:32,273
I have never done so.

1419
02:19:32,393 --> 02:19:34,833
But perhaps now it is the time.

1420
02:19:36,192 --> 02:19:40,431
Major Gruver has asked me
to be his... his wife.

1421
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:48,947
He knows there are many people in
this country who will be disturbed by this.

1422
02:19:49,068 --> 02:19:51,787
I know my people will be shocked too.

1423
02:19:51,907 --> 02:19:56,945
But I hope they will learn to understand
and someday approve.

1424
02:19:58,185 --> 02:20:02,863
We are not afraid,
because we know this is right.

1425
02:20:02,983 --> 02:20:05,462
I hope I can continue as a dancer

1426
02:20:05,582 --> 02:20:11,019
and I hope when I am old,
I will be able to teach children to dance.

1427
02:20:12,099 --> 02:20:14,818
My own children.

1428
02:20:14,938 --> 02:20:17,937
Major, the big brass are gonna
yell their heads off.

1429
02:20:18,057 --> 02:20:24,614
The Japanese aren’t gonna like it either.
Have you got anything to say to them, sir?

1430
02:20:24,733 --> 02:20:25,813
Yeah.

1431
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:29,238
Tell ‘em we said “sayonara”.
