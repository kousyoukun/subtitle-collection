1
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:50,809
Russel?

2
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,708
Russel, there's someone in here!

3
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,544
Russel!

4
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,646
Honey, what's wrong?

5
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,648
What's wrong? What is it?
- There was someone here.

6
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,517
I got you.

7
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,921
I got you. You're safe.

8
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:40,689
There's no one in here, Lauren.

9
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:43,495
I got you.

10
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:05,506
DISTORTED

11
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,923
Hey.

12
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,194
We gotta get out of here.

13
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,166
I just want you to feel safe.

14
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,541
Okay?

15
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,644
I love you.
- I love you too.

16
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,559
Wow, look at
this place.

17
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:33,690
Lauren. Russel.

18
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,692
I'm Lance, sales agent.

19
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:37,794
Welcome to twenty-first
century living.

20
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,863
I'll like you to meet out
head concierge, Dominique.

21
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,698
Hi.

22
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,900
And our service engineer, Ryan.
- A pleasure.

23
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:47,736
I hope you'll be joining us.

24
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:50,108
Right, if you'd like
to follow me this way.

25
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:55,712
We have seven different
scents pumped into the lobby

26
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,279
and elevator.

27
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:59,448
We've recruited an
acclaimed interior designer,

28
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,351
lighting specialist,
acoustical scientist,

29
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:04,453
even a feng shui expert, to help
us create the ultimate comfort

30
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:06,856
and tranquility.

31
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,392
Now, our amenities include a
state-of-the-art fitness center,

32
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:14,000
outdoor pool, games room, 20
seat multimedia screening room.

33
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:18,000
All suites have access
to our 24-hour surveillance

34
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,139
of all key venues.

35
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,045
Okay. Please follow me.

36
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:35,784
Wireless lighting, QED window
shades with sun control fabric,

37
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:38,387
and a fully integrated
telecommunications

38
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,692
cabling package.

39
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:46,298
Why don't you take your time?
Feel free to have a look around.

40
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,435
Go upstairs.

41
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,914
What do you think?

42
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,051
I think, uh,

43
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:12,188
no one deserves to
live this well.

44
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,491
Hey,

45
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:19,432
70-hour work weeks,
three years without a vacation.

46
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:23,832
We had two priorities:
security and serenity.

47
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,969
And unless you wanna move
into Fort Knox, we're not gonna get

48
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,171
more secure than this.

49
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:32,342
And as for serenity...

50
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,087
I think living outside of the
city would be great for us.

51
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,459
You know?

52
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,733
Whatever you decide.

53
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,926
Let's do this.

54
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,964
Baby.

55
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:37,869
This is gonna be
so good for both of us.

56
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,904
It's, uh...

57
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:47,043
it's, uh, big,
gorgeous, modern, safe.

58
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:50,246
An embarrassment
of riches, really.

59
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,017
And yet?

60
00:10:56,021 --> 00:11:00,289
I don't know, I'm just...
I... I'm still so scared.

61
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:05,093
Scared to, uh, you know,
to, uh, join the world again.

62
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:08,398
Scared to pick up a paint brush.

63
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,333
That blank canvas.

64
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,703
But, um...

65
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:17,606
I think I'm mostly scared
because I know that if I don't

66
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:21,510
stop being scared I'm
just gonna lose everything.

67
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:24,016
Right?

68
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,460
Still working out the kinks.

69
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,728
You look beautiful.

70
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,597
If you get uncomfortable,
if this is a crushing bore,

71
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,667
we're an elevator
ride away from home.

72
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,135
I know.
- Okay.

73
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:50,505
I'll get my jacket.
- Okay.

74
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,590
Hey, sweetheart.

75
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:10,659
I'm Margo.
- Hi, Margo. Russel.

76
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,761
Scott's wife.
- Nice to meet you.

77
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,563
Nice to meet you, too.

78
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:17,033
I'm Lauren.
- Hi Lauren.

79
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,303
Come on, let's ditch
the excess baggage.

80
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,778
Phillip Starks, 120.
Inherited his father's

81
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,648
Fortune 500 marketing
and advertising agency.

82
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,617
Brilliant. And about as
close to the ideal neighbor

83
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:38,154
as you can possibly ever find.

84
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:43,025
Gwendolyn Serota-Talal.

85
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:46,462
Married to a Saudi
kazillionaire who's never around,

86
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,231
leaving her with
far too much time

87
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,664
on her criminally
unflawed hands.

88
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:53,403
Tim Hoyle.

89
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,172
Something to do with geoscience.

90
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:59,409
Single, bit peculiar,
but perfectly harmless.

91
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,177
Oh.

92
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,482
Don't you stray far.

93
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:55,164
Well, I believe we have
two things in common.

94
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,433
May I?
- Oh, please.

95
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,505
So word around the
building is you're a painter.

96
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,307
I am.

97
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:07,809
While I've never advanced
beyond the stick figure stage myself,

98
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:11,746
I do have an enthusiasm
for impressionism,

99
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:14,483
post-impressionism,
and expressionism.

100
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:17,687
And the second thing?

101
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,591
Well, we both harbor a
keen aversion to cocktail parties.

102
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:22,891
Oh.

103
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:25,561
Not to fret, the signs
are undetectable

104
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:28,364
to your regulation "cocktalian."

105
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,399
But as a charter member of

106
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:36,204
the save-me-from-idle-chatter
alliance, I've developed a nose.

107
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:39,909
Well, to kindred neighbors.

108
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,678
To kindred neighbors.

109
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,416
Cheers.
- Cheers.

110
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,398
Someone's in here.

111
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,550
I had a bad dream.

112
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:26,222
Ali?

113
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,391
What are you doing down here?
- I had a bad dream.

114
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,593
Oh, let's get you back upstairs.

115
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:34,232
You can tell me and
your mommy all about it.

116
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:47,309
So you and Margo seemed to
get along like a house on fire.

117
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:51,246
She's, um, refreshing.

118
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:55,451
What, like a line
of coke on a Tuesday?

119
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:58,190
Did you know they
have a daughter?

120
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,925
Ali.

121
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,864
Scott couldn't stop
gushing about her.

122
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:14,270
I'm just gonna go get some
water. Do you want some?

123
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,440
Sure.

124
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:43,639
<i>Fighting broke
out the other night between...</i>

125
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:46,641
So I got approval on
the delisting, so we should

126
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:50,278
be able to file notification
for removal Thursday.

127
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,848
I seem to remember you saying
something about scaling back

128
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,650
on work once
everything was settled.

129
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:58,888
Gotcha. Phone down.

130
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,657
<i>Initial reports claim
Israeli jet fighters bombed the guerila</i>

131
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,963
<i>base, killing at least 49
soldiers and 13 civilians.</i>

132
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:08,930
A word just flashed
across the screen.

133
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,834
What word?

134
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:15,204
I don't know, it was too fast.

135
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:19,574
But I swear, a word just
flashed across the television screen.

136
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:23,047
I'm... I'm not disputing you.
It's just it's satellite TV.

137
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,787
If it happens again I'll
call Ryan. He'll fix it. Okay?

138
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:46,770
<i>Mommy.</i>

139
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,299
<i>Mommy!</i>

140
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,136
Lauren? Hey!

141
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,037
Jesus!
- What?

142
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,438
It's one of the residents.
- What?

143
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,110
Look. Look.

144
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,912
Are you sure?

145
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:40,951
Yeah, I'm sure.
He was right here.

146
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:43,752
Hey, hey.

147
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:46,220
Remember what Beatrice said.
That change can be a trigger...

148
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:48,990
This is not in my head,
he was right here.

149
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,362
Baby. It's just gonna take time.

150
00:23:56,834 --> 00:24:00,134
If it happens again,
call me right away.

151
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,005
We'll, uh, see if
we can't pinpoint it.

152
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,872
I appreciate it.

153
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:07,409
Otherwise, you're settling in okay?

154
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,111
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh...

155
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:12,249
we are.

156
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,019
Good.

157
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:20,325
Thanks.

158
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:26,195
Hello.

159
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:28,496
<i>Hey, just wondering
if you had lunch plans.</i>

160
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,367
I don't.

161
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,034
Meditative was too slow.

162
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,504
Bikram's too hot.
Kundalini too esoteric.

163
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,872
Then I found this off-the-wall
Ashtanga studio

164
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,475
down on Brookline.

165
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,713
I've been attending
faithfully every since.

166
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:45,447
Well, looks like
it agrees with you.

167
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:48,053
Aw, this is truly the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

168
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,522
Let me ask you.

169
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:57,862
Have you noticed anything, uh,
unusual about your apartment?

170
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:02,531
I just, I keep hearing
this strange hissing sound,

171
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:06,134
like something's been left on.

172
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:10,272
Hm. Well, we've had problems

173
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,975
with the floor
heating in our en suite,

174
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:16,344
and our terrace lights seem
to have a mind of their own,

175
00:25:16,346 --> 00:25:18,382
but no hissing.

176
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,755
I guess even Shangri-La
has its share of gremlins.

177
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,124
Wasn't there music
on in the party?

178
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:12,093
Yeah.

179
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:15,264
It's probably just on rotation
in the building's PA system.

180
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,131
No, I checked.

181
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:18,633
"Beautiful Dreamer" is
not on their playlist.

182
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:19,834
Huh.

183
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:23,005
And either way that wouldn't
explain the electronic hiss,

184
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:25,407
the voices, the images.

185
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,610
So, what are you trying to say?

186
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:31,412
I know how this is gonna sound,

187
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:37,986
but what if someone is
using this building as, um,

188
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:40,458
kind of an experiment?

189
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,695
The Pinnacle is owned by a
man named Henning Dallquist.

190
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,868
He has extensive holdings in...

191
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,240
I wish you wouldn't look
at me like that.

192
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:17,426
With respect to subliminal
imagery, Vicary was interesting.

193
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:20,428
He had been using a high-speed
projector to flash the slogans

194
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,031
"drink Coke" and "eat popcorn"
at one three-thousandths

195
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:25,199
of a second, at
five second intervals.

196
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,468
Now, according to Mr. Vicary,
popcorn sales went up about

197
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,371
60% and Coke sales about 20%.

198
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:32,573
So it's been proven effective?

199
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,444
Well, that particular study
was never subjected to a, um,

200
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:38,647
proper scientific review,
and from what I gather,

201
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,550
the evidence of success
has been greatly exaggerated.

202
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:43,552
Makes for good copy
more than anything.

203
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,586
Did your father ever
use subliminal advertising

204
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:47,989
in any of his early campaigns?

205
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,624
From what I understand, a
few of his competitors did test

206
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:53,628
the waters, but the FCC
quickly stepped in.

207
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,163
Ruling due process
contrary to public interest,

208
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:58,132
effectively outlawing it.

209
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:01,203
And that law's enforced?
- As far as I understand.

210
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:04,038
Although, as urban myth
would have it, you still have your

211
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,574
odd department store slipping
anti-theft warning through their

212
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:10,678
muzak systems, or a heavy metal
band masking satanic messages.

213
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,114
And of course, nowadays,
with your buzz agents,

214
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:15,649
product feeders,
viral marketers,

215
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:18,586
everyone plugged in 24/7,
the Federal Communications

216
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:21,156
Commission need hardly
have bothered.

217
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:23,658
Now, may I ask, what is
your interest in all this?

218
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,329
Oh, I'm not really
that interested.

219
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:31,065
I just, I met someone recently
who was talking about it,

220
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,369
and I know your father
was in advertising, so.

221
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,040
Hm.

222
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,765
Hey.

223
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,603
What're you doing out here?

224
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:12,541
I was just thinking
about our third date.

225
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:15,279
We were watching
Cirque du Soleil.

226
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,351
That trapeze artist was doing
some death defying stunt.

227
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:28,426
You reached out for my
hand and you squeezed it.

228
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,861
I just remember wishing
I could always be there,

229
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:36,733
holding your hand
through the scary parts.

230
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,646
If we don't get results
within four to six weeks,

231
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,849
I like to try upping the dosage.

232
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,784
In the interim...

233
00:30:55,786 --> 00:31:00,721
Plenty of rest, exercise,
no additional stress.

234
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:02,559
I know.

235
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:09,598
I checked out an adoption
agency the other day.

236
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,199
Talk about jumping the gun, huh?

237
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:15,172
Lauren, this is a minor setback.

238
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:21,312
Okay.

239
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:01,765
Sorry.

240
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,933
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

241
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,967
I didn't hear you.

242
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:09,603
The hallways are
designed to reduce sound.

243
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,075
Right.

244
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:14,942
Tim Hoyle.

245
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:16,680
I'm Lauren Curran.

246
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,786
I'm not one of them.

247
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,523
Excuse me?

248
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:23,745
As I see you've fallen sway
to Phillip's irresistible charms.

249
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:27,181
Have you seen him
the past couple days?

250
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:29,586
I actually haven't.

251
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:38,828
You can ask Lauren
yourself, you know.

252
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,701
Ali was wondering if you'd
like to come swimming with us.

253
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,705
Remember to kick
your feet. - I will.

254
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,143
Good girl.

255
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:05,953
Ali?

256
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:15,629
Lauren, help her!

257
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:17,598
It's okay, sweetheart.

258
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,536
It's okay.

259
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,950
It's okay.

260
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:51,199
Have you heard of, uh...

261
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:55,837
pulsed electromagnetic fields,
or, uh, covert hypnosis?

262
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,911
Okay.

263
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,779
Let me ask you this.

264
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:07,549
Why, why you? Why can't
I hear any of these sounds?

265
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,783
Why can't I see any
of these images?

266
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:12,120
I think it has something
to do with my medication.

267
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:15,757
I think it acts as
some sort of buffer.

268
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,792
Or it could be the manic
depression itself.

269
00:38:18,794 --> 00:38:21,696
I'm wired differently than you.

270
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,065
Are you feeling all right?

271
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,201
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.

272
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:30,737
Maybe we should go see
Beatrice in the morning.

273
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:33,942
I don't need to see Beatrice.
I need you to listen to me.

274
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,011
I am listening to you,
Lauren, I am.

275
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:40,949
Conspiracy theories,
delusions of persecution,

276
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,783
messages being sent
through the TV.

277
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:50,894
Lauren can't you see?
It's happening all over again.

278
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:25,796
Oh!

279
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:17,981
You're still grieving,
and you're still healing.

280
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:22,352
It all takes time.

281
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,755
Often a lot more
time than we'd like.

282
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,451
Hello.

283
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,756
<i>Why me?</i>

284
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:05,359
Your posts are smart,
well referenced, and, uh,

285
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,797
I don't have anyone else.

286
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:11,732
Hello?

287
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,900
<i>I'm sending you encrypted
documents, read them.</i>

288
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:16,239
<i>Password is your
favorite coffee shop.</i>

289
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,296
Phone.

290
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:16,830
Is it off?
- Yeah.

291
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:18,267
Close the door.

292
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:24,237
I'll give you two minutes.

293
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,406
Okay, uh.

294
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:29,442
The information you sent me,
I get it.

295
00:42:29,444 --> 00:42:33,181
The CIA caught up in
a mind control arms race

296
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,116
with the Russians
and the Chinese.

297
00:42:35,118 --> 00:42:38,286
But, uh, what does that...

298
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:41,022
well, isn't that ancient
history?

299
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:43,857
Well, it's by definition
an idea ahead of its time.

300
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,326
The digital technologies
advance, so theory and practice

301
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:48,895
finally and tragically meet.

302
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,933
What are you experiencing?

303
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,870
Coercive flash images, I think,

304
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,507
and, uh, some kind
of binaural sounds.

305
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:06,183
I'll send you more documents.
- Okay.

306
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,087
You're not paranoid.

307
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:22,992
Oh, God!

308
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:28,131
Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

309
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:37,574
So apparently he had a
history of mental illness.

310
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:43,113
We have to get out
of here, Russel.

311
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,951
He wasn't well.

312
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:52,955
There's nothing more
to it than that.

313
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,560
<i>I'd say earlier is better.</i>

314
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:10,399
<i>Not very many people
around that time of day.</i>

315
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:19,343
I just wouldn't want
anyone to get hurt.

316
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:25,649
Who you talking to?

317
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:31,317
I thought I heard you
talking to someone.

318
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,123
No, I wasn't talking
to anyone, Lauren.

319
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:47,301
I just couldn't sleep and, uh...

320
00:46:47,303 --> 00:46:50,239
it beats warm milk.

321
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,725
You sure you don't
want me to stay home?

322
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:15,598
No. I'll be fine.

323
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:22,603
Just call me if you
need to talk, okay?

324
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:24,641
I love you.

325
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:42,482
Did you get the files I sent?

326
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:43,917
Uh,

327
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:46,589
yeah.

328
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,895
837 Audio Jammer.

329
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,665
Who are you?

330
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:59,533
Nobody. Hacker, journalist.

331
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,870
I spend my time writing a book
about all this dark tech shit.

332
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:05,638
I'd stop taking the
Quintinal if I were you.

333
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,540
I noticed you order
your pharm online.

334
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,146
I generally advise against that.

335
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,714
What else do you know about me?

336
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:17,518
My theory is your condition has
you operating on a frequency

337
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,920
outside the range of their tech.

338
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:22,957
You're like an outlier,
a black swan.

339
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:27,761
The catch-22, too little meds
your condition takes over,

340
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:31,265
too much, they do.

341
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,833
I haven't been taking them.

342
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,902
That's one for the win column.

343
00:49:35,904 --> 00:49:37,740
Disconnect your wifi.

344
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:46,480
You watch procedurals?

345
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:49,984
Common motif, everything
is conjecture or hearsay

346
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:53,823
or straight-up paranoia,
until you get physical evidence.

347
00:49:55,524 --> 00:49:58,292
This is the Pinnacle?
- Uh huh.

348
00:49:58,294 --> 00:50:01,364
One of those files
has all the lock codes.

349
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:06,299
The new tech has
revolutionized the world.

350
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:08,736
Everything's moving
at quantum speeds.

351
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:11,705
Politics, commerce, and
coordinated criminal activity.

352
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:15,341
You can walk into any coffee
shop in the civilized world

353
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:17,911
and you can see our virtual
consumption has us ripe

354
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,748
for a psychotronic takeover.

355
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,984
So it's not that much of a
stretch to think of competing

356
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,520
multinationals putting up
smart buildings

357
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,788
in Tokyo, London, Chicago.

358
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,326
There's a whole world of
wealthy, cybernated marionettes

359
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:35,265
just waiting for their
strings to get pulled.

360
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,632
It's happening,

361
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:41,471
and I think you
can help me prove it.

362
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,986
Delivery.

363
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:33,754
Hi. - How did you
get through the gate?

364
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:36,058
Just walked through, it
was open. 720, Nancy Hiemer?

365
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:39,828
I'm afraid we don't have
a resident by that name.

366
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,833
I'm sorry, you
don't have a unit 720?

367
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:49,402
There is a 720.
- Does Nancy Hiemer live there?

368
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:52,004
I'm not at liberty to...
The point being, we don't have

369
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:54,074
a Nancy Hiemer living here.
- You don't?

370
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:55,842
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

371
00:51:55,844 --> 00:51:58,011
This is The Pinnacle?
- Or I will call security.

372
00:51:58,013 --> 00:52:00,013
Relax, I'm just trying
to deliver a package.

373
00:52:00,015 --> 00:52:02,451
You should get that gate
checked. I walked right in.

374
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:38,511
Well, it does look like
military grade hardware.

375
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:41,517
I forgot the brand
name, but I'll look into it.

376
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:47,054
I'll have a guy I know

377
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:49,188
check into this Henning
Dallquist character,

378
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,160
see what I can dig up.

379
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:55,995
You all right?

380
00:53:55,997 --> 00:53:58,100
Yeah.

381
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,978
Russel?

382
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:09,272
Hey. When did you get in?

383
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,044
So who's in 410?

384
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,057
Excuse me.

385
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:32,625
That suite's vacant.

386
00:55:32,627 --> 00:55:34,928
Like I said, it's empty.

387
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,931
Our amenities include a
state-of-the-art fitness center,

388
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:41,804
outdoor pool, games room, 20
seat multimedia screening room.

389
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:02,321
<i>It's a new generation of
single mode fibre optic.</i>

390
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:04,223
What's it used for?

391
00:56:04,225 --> 00:56:07,027
<i>It's not our smoking gun,
if that's what you're asking.</i>

392
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:09,098
What about Henning Dallquist?

393
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,868
I gotta go, I'll call you back.

394
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:38,284
<i>I wanna meet somewhere else.</i>

395
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:41,690
<i>Why?</i>
- <i>I'm being followed.</i>

396
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:31,207
Henning Dallquist
isn't calling the shots.

397
00:58:32,107 --> 00:58:34,473
Then who is?

398
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:37,009
I don't know.

399
00:58:37,011 --> 00:58:39,812
What is this?

400
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:41,982
You should get out, Lauren.
- What?

401
00:58:41,984 --> 00:58:45,252
Get out. Run. Go.

402
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:47,953
I can't.
- I understand how you feel.

403
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:51,491
I've been down this
road myself, you know.

404
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:55,795
I don't know you. I
don't even know your name.

405
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:58,464
I'm supposed to listen to you?
You could be one of them.

406
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:03,303
You found me.
I didn't find you.

407
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:05,971
At the end of the day,

408
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:09,842
there's a part of you
that can't be touched.

409
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:12,045
You gotta listen to
that part of yourself.

410
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:14,147
Who do you trust?
- Wait.

411
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:17,053
Get out.
- Wait!

412
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:41,473
Lauren. I need to
ask you to sit down.

413
00:59:41,475 --> 00:59:43,844
What's going on?

414
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:47,080
Well, Russel thinks you
should be hospitalized again.

415
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,449
What?

416
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:52,518
This is about your son, Lauren.

417
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,355
This is memories and
emotions that have been festering

418
00:59:55,357 --> 00:59:58,991
in some dark corner of
your subconscious for so long

419
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:02,995
that they've mutated into
something else altogether.

420
01:00:02,997 --> 01:00:05,498
Lauren.
- Stay away from me.

421
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,538
I miss him too, Lauren.
You just gotta let him go.

422
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:13,976
I don't know what to do anymore.

423
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:26,389
Lauren.

424
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:29,425
Lauren!

425
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:14,629
That's the catch-22.

426
01:02:17,431 --> 01:02:20,132
Too little meds and
your condition takes over.

427
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:22,502
Too much...

428
01:02:28,576 --> 01:02:30,710
In the morning.

429
01:02:30,712 --> 01:02:34,016
I'll pack tonight and you can
take me back in the morning.

430
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,413
Sure I can't get you anything?

431
01:03:39,413 --> 01:03:41,681
I'm fine.

432
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:44,587
All right, I'll just
be at the gym.

433
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,341
June 2nd, 9 a.m.

434
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,316
Initiate.

435
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:17,473
Hello?

436
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:30,185
Hey, can anyone
hear me in here?

437
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:26,507
Come here!
- No! No, no!

438
01:07:58,006 --> 01:08:00,640
<i>Kill her.</i>

439
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:03,009
<i>Mommy?</i>

440
01:08:05,747 --> 01:08:08,417
<i>Obey. Obey.<i>
- <i>Kill, kill.</i>

441
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:15,056
<i>Kill the child.</i>
- <i>Kill the child.</i>

442
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:19,359
<i>Murder.</i>
- <i>Murder the child.</i>

443
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,830
<i>Kill. Murder. Obey.</i>

444
01:08:23,465 --> 01:08:26,098
<i>Obey. Obey.</i>
- <i>Kill. Murder.</i>

445
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,602
<i>Obey. Murder. Kill.</i>

446
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:31,507
<i>The child.</i>

447
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:37,345
<i>Murder the child.
Kill the child.</i>

448
01:08:44,551 --> 01:08:46,785
Breathe.

449
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:49,554
I'll get you outta here.
You're gonna be all right.

450
01:08:49,556 --> 01:08:51,758
Come on.

451
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,627
They're trying to get me
to kill Ali at the playground.

452
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:56,561
She's a three-year-old.

453
01:08:56,563 --> 01:08:59,766
Then they'll prove that they
can get anyone to do anything.

454
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,933
My car's on the south
side of the street.

455
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:03,802
The safety's off.

456
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:05,605
I'm not leaving you.

457
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:07,376
That's a three-year-old girl
you're talking about, right?

458
01:09:07,608 --> 01:09:09,441
<i>Lauren!</i>

459
01:09:09,443 --> 01:09:11,643
My name's Vernon, by the way.

460
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:13,482
Go.

461
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:18,987
<i>Lauren!</i>

462
01:09:37,138 --> 01:09:39,571
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

463
01:09:39,573 --> 01:09:41,673
<i>He's in the stairwell.</i>

464
01:09:41,675 --> 01:09:44,110
I told you my name already.
I don't...

465
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:47,012
Listen. Listen! You're
not listening to me!

466
01:09:47,014 --> 01:09:48,750
What?

467
01:09:49,783 --> 01:09:51,452
Damn it.

468
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:18,945
You're Ephrina, right?

469
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:21,083
Ali's in danger.

470
01:10:26,153 --> 01:10:28,156
Stay back.

471
01:10:31,626 --> 01:10:33,762
Stop! This woman, she's crazy!

472
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:37,663
Stop!
- Lauren, I'm here to help you.

473
01:10:37,665 --> 01:10:39,935
Stop! Stay away from me.

474
01:10:42,103 --> 01:10:44,940
Stay away.
Get in the car, sweetie.

475
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:48,140
Get down, get down
so no one can see you.

476
01:10:48,142 --> 01:10:50,142
Lauren, I'm trying to help you.

477
01:10:50,144 --> 01:10:52,043
Stay back.
- You were right.

478
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:54,112
Everything you were
trying to say this whole time,

479
01:10:54,114 --> 01:10:56,050
every word of it is true.

480
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:59,752
No, I will shoot you Russel.
- It's a spy cam.

481
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:02,687
I was trying to prove
that it was all in your head,

482
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,191
so I hid it in the office,
Lauren.

483
01:11:05,193 --> 01:11:07,627
I saw what they did to you.

484
01:11:07,629 --> 01:11:10,929
I saw you strapped to
that chair, and the images

485
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:13,568
and the sounds they were
trying to pummel you with.

486
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:19,905
Lauren. Lauren. They
almost got to me, okay?

487
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,977
Now I'm here for you.

488
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,310
Lauren!

489
01:11:26,947 --> 01:11:28,616
Stay away.

490
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:42,962
<i>Mommy. Mommy.</i>

491
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:45,330
<i>Kill. Murder. Kill.</i>
- <i>Kill the child.</i>

492
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:47,732
<i>Mommy.</i>

493
01:11:47,734 --> 01:11:51,102
<i>Kill the child. Ali.</i>
- <i>Kill. Murder the child.</i>

494
01:11:51,104 --> 01:11:55,209
<i>Ali, Ali.</i>
- <i>Kill the child.</i>

495
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:16,329
<i>Kill her!</i>

496
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:20,134
<i>Kill her!</i>

497
01:13:20,094 --> 01:13:22,264
We're safe now.

498
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:46,388
Wait right here for me.

499
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:03,337
Are you frightened, honey?

500
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:13,478
I know this must seem really
scary and hard to understand.

501
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,816
But I promise,

502
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:19,118
it's almost over now.

503
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,422
Okay? Okay.

504
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,860
Can you lay down here for me?

505
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:39,105
<i>Mommy. Mommy.</i>
- <i>Murder. Kill.</i>

506
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,406
<i>Ali.</i>

507
01:14:41,408 --> 01:14:44,379
<i>Mommy, please kill her.</i>

508
01:17:17,898 --> 01:17:19,999
Hello, Lauren.

509
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:22,370
Phillip.

510
01:17:23,004 --> 01:17:25,306
Care to put down your bag?

511
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:34,245
Any complications?

512
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:36,417
None.

513
01:17:37,617 --> 01:17:40,218
Lauren, you are fully
aware of what you've done?

514
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,454
I am.

515
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:44,656
How you feel about that?

516
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:46,995
I feel contented.

517
01:17:48,028 --> 01:17:50,397
Hm, why is that?

518
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:55,334
I've done exactly
what was asked of me.

519
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:58,070
You do understand that, when
everything is brought to light,

520
01:17:58,072 --> 01:18:00,338
you'll be charged with
first degree murder.

521
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,409
Does this concern you?

522
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:06,915
I've done exactly
what was asked of me.

523
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:19,658
You cannot begin to fathom
the extraordinary contribution

524
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,694
you have made here today.

525
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:25,297
Psychotechnology...

526
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:28,400
the battle for the mind.

527
01:18:28,402 --> 01:18:30,602
It's the new arms race.

528
01:18:30,604 --> 01:18:34,039
The holy grail of
global sovereignty.

529
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,642
And with your help,

530
01:18:36,644 --> 01:18:38,444
we've just managed
to leave our competitors

531
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:41,049
in the proverbial dust.

532
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:44,984
As with any war,

533
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:49,521
victory can only be
achieved with certain sacrifices.

534
01:18:49,523 --> 01:18:52,257
And history will bear
out that none of this,

535
01:18:52,259 --> 01:18:55,063
none of this has
been done in vain.

536
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:20,753
I had a bad dream.

537
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:23,391
Everyone plugged in 24/7.

538
01:19:25,593 --> 01:19:27,726
Long psychotic episode.

539
01:19:27,728 --> 01:19:30,262
Who do you trust?

540
01:19:30,264 --> 01:19:32,431
Lauren, I'm trying to help you.

541
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:34,133
Who do you trust?

542
01:19:38,171 --> 01:19:40,806
Russel?

543
01:19:40,808 --> 01:19:43,444
Just let them know, she's safe.

544
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:57,158
Evidence of success has
been greatly exaggerated.

545
01:19:57,558 --> 01:19:59,527
What the fuck is this?

546
01:21:44,564 --> 01:21:46,664
I can't get this
damn thing to work.

547
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:53,340
That might be a good thing.

548
01:22:00,714 --> 01:22:03,384
We're all safe now.
