Have you noticed anything, uh,
unusual about your apartment?

and our terrace lights seem to
have a mind of their own,

236
00:25:16,346 --> 00:25:18,382
but no hissing.

237

I know how this is gonna sound,

but what if someone is using
this building as, um,

kind of an experiment?

261

named Henning Dallquist.

262

[knocks]

265
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:17,426
With respect to subliminal
imagery, Vicary was interesting.

266
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:20,428
He had been using a high-speed
projector to flash the slogans

267
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,031
"drink Coke" and "eat popcorn"
at one three-thousandths

268
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:25,199
of a second, at five
second intervals.

269
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,468
Now, according to Mr. Vicary,
popcorn sales went up about

270
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,371
60% and Coke sales about 20%.

271
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:32,573
So it's been proven effective?

272
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,444
Well, that particular study was
never subjected to a, um,

273
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:38,647
proper scientific review,
and from what I gather,

274
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,550
the evidence of success has
been greatly exaggerated.

275
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:43,552
Makes for good copy
more than anything.

276
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,586
Did your father ever use
subliminal advertising

277
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:47,989
in any of his early campaigns?

278
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,624
From what I understand, a few
of his competitors did test

279
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:53,628
the waters, but the FCC
quickly stepped in.

280
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,163
Ruling due process contrary
to public interest,

281
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:58,132

282
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:01,203
- And that law's enforced?
- As far as I understand.

283
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:04,038
Although, as urban myth would
have it, you still have your

odd department store slipping
anti-theft warning through their

285
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:10,678
muzak systems, or a heavy metal
band masking satanic messages.

Now, may I ask, what is
your interest in all this?

00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,329
Oh, I'm not really
that interested.

who was talking about it,

293
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,369
and I know your father was
in advertising, so.

some death defying stunt.

You reached out for my hand
and you squeezed it.

I could always be there,

In the interim...

no additional stress.

Sorry.

330
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,933
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

331
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,967
I didn't hear you.

332
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:09,603
The hallways are designed
to reduce sound.

333
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,075
Right.

Tim Hoyle.

335
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:16,680
I'm Lauren Curran.

336
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,786
I'm not one of them.

337
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,523
Excuse me?

[laughs]

342
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:27,181
Have you seen him
the past couple days?

343
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:29,586
I actually haven't.

344

[Ali whispering]

345
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:38,828
You can ask Lauren
yourself, you know.

346
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,701
Ali was wondering if you'd
like to come swimming with us.

347
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,705
- Remember to kick your feet.
- I will.

348
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,143
Good girl.

It's okay, sweetheart.

355
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,536
It's okay.

[Ali coughs]

357
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,950
It's okay.

358
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:51,199
Have you heard of, uh...

359
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:55,837
pulsed electromagnetic fields,
or, uh, covert hypnosis?

360

[drops cutlery]

361
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,911
Okay.

362
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,779
Let me ask you this.

363
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:07,549
Why, why you? Why can't I hear
any of these sounds?

364
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,783
Why can't I see any
of these images?

365
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:12,120
I think it has something
to do with my medication.

366
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:15,757
I think it acts as
some sort of buffer.

367
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,792
Or it could be the manic
depression itself.

368
00:38:18,794 --> 00:38:21,696
I'm wired differently than you.

369
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,065
Are you feeling all right?

370
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,201
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.

371
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:30,737
Maybe we should go see
Beatrice in the morning.

372
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:33,942
I don't need to see Beatrice.
I need you to listen to me.

373
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,011
I am listening to you,
Lauren, I am.

374
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:40,949
Conspiracy theories,
delusions of persecution,

375
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,783

through the TV.

You're still grieving,
and you're still healing.

385
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:22,352
It all takes time.

386
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,755
Often a lot more

I don't have anyone else.

Close the door.

401
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:24,237
I'll give you two minutes.

402
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,406
Okay, uh.

403
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:29,442
The information you sent me,
I get it.

404
00:42:29,444 --> 00:42:33,181
The CIA caught up in
a mind control arms race

405
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,116
with the Russians
and the Chinese.

406
00:42:35,118 --> 00:42:38,286
But, uh, what does that...

407
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:41,022
well, isn't that ancient
history?

408
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:43,857
Well, it's by definition
an idea ahead of its time.

409
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,326
The digital technologies
advance, so theory and practice

finally and tragically meet.

411
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,933
What are you experiencing?

412
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,870
Coercive flash images, I think,

413
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,507
and, uh, some kind of
binaural sounds.

414
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:06,183
- I'll send you more documents.
- Okay.

415
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,087
You're not paranoid.

- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

So apparently he had a

We have to get out
of here, Russel.

[Lauren] Who you talking to?

I thought I heard you
talking to someone.

434
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,123
No, I wasn't talking
to anyone, Lauren.

435
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:47,301
I just couldn't sleep and, uh...

No. I'll be fine.

[whispering]
Nobody. Hacker, journalist.

452
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,870
I spend my time writing a book
about all this dark tech shit.

453
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:05,638
I'd stop taking the
Quintinal if I were you.

454
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,540
I noticed you order
your pharm online.

455
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,146
I generally advise against that.

What else do you know about me?

457
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:17,518
My theory is your condition has
you operating on a frequency

458
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,920
outside the range of their tech.

459
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:22,957
You're like an outlier,
a black swan.

460
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:27,761
The catch-22, too little meds
your condition takes over,

461
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:31,265
too much, they do.

462
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,833
I haven't been taking them.

463
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,902
That's one for the win column.

464
00:49:35,904 --> 00:49:37,740
Disconnect your wifi.

465
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:46,480
You watch procedurals?

466
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:49,984
Common motif, everything is
conjecture or hearsay

467
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:53,823
or straight-up paranoia, until
you get physical evidence.

468
00:49:55,524 --> 00:49:58,292
- This is The Pinnacle?
- Uh huh.

469
00:49:58,294 --> 00:50:01,364
One of those files has
all the lock codes.

470
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:06,299
The new tech has
revolutionized the world.

471
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:08,736
Everything's moving
at quantum speeds.

472
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:11,705
Politics, commerce, and
coordinated criminal activity.

473
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:15,341
You can walk into any coffee
shop in the civilized world

474
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:17,911
and you can see our virtual
consumption has us ripe

475
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,748
for a psychotronic takeover.

476
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,984
So it's not that much of a
stretch to think of competing

477
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,520
multinationals putting up
smart buildings

478
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,788
in Tokyo, London, Chicago.

479
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,326
There's a whole world of
wealthy, cybernated marionettes

480
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:35,265
just waiting for their
strings to get pulled.

481
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,632
It's happening,

482
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:41,471
and I think you can help me
prove it.

- Hi.
- How did you get through the gate?

487
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:36,058
Just walked through, it was
open. 720, Nancy Hiemer?

488
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:39,828
I'm afraid we don't have
a resident by that name.

489
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,833
I'm sorry, you don't
have a unit 720?

490
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:49,402
- There is a 720.
- Does Nancy Hiemer live there?

491
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:52,004
I'm not at liberty to...

01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,191
so I hid it in the office,
Lauren.

654
01:11:05,193 --> 01:11:07,627
I saw what they did to you.

655
01:11:07,629 --> 01:11:10,929
I saw you strapped to that
chair, and the images

656
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:13,568
and the sounds they were trying
to pummel you with.

657
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:19,905
Lauren. Lauren. They almost
got to me, okay?

658
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,977
Now I'm here for you.

659
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,310

We're safe now.

Wait right here for me.

Are you frightened, honey?

680
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:13,478
I know this must seem really
scary and hard to understand.

681
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,816
But I promise,

682
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:19,118
it's almost over now.

683
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,422
Okay? Okay.

684
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,860
Can you lay down here for me?

[Phillip] Hello, Lauren.

693
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:22,370
[Lauren] Phillip.

694
01:17:23,004 --> 01:17:25,306
Care to put down your bag?

695
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:34,245
Any complications?

696
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:36,417
None.

697
01:17:37,617 --> 01:17:40,218
Lauren, you are fully
aware of what you've done?

698
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,454
I am.

699
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:44,656
How you feel about that?

700
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:46,995
I feel contented.

701
01:17:48,028 --> 01:17:50,397
Hm, why is that?

702
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:55,334
I've done exactly
what was asked of me.

703
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:58,070
You do understand that, when
everything is brought to light,

704
01:17:58,072 --> 01:18:00,338
you'll be charged with
first degree murder.

705
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,409
Does this concern you?

706
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:06,915
I've done exactly
what was asked of me.

707
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:19,658
You cannot begin to fathom the
extraordinary contribution

708
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,694
you have made here today.

709
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:25,297
Psychotechnology...

710
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:28,400
the battle for the mind.

711
01:18:28,402 --> 01:18:30,602
It's the new arms race.

712
01:18:30,604 --> 01:18:34,039
The holy grail of
global sovereignty.

713
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,642
And with your help,

714
01:18:36,644 --> 01:18:38,444
we've just managed to leave
our competitors

715
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:41,049
in the proverbial dust.

716
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:44,984
As with any war,

717
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:49,521
victory can only be achieved
with certain sacrifices.

718
01:18:49,523 --> 01:18:52,257
And history will bear out
that none of this,

719
01:18:52,259 --> 01:18:55,063
none of this has been
done in vain.

720

I had a bad dream.

Everyone plugged in 24/7.

Long psychotic episode.

Who do you trust?

727
01:19:30,264 --> 01:19:32,431
Lauren, I'm trying to help you.

728
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:34,133
Who do you trust?

Russel?

731
01:19:40,808 --> 01:19:43,444
Just let them know, she's safe.

732
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:57,158
Evidence of success has
been greatly exaggerated.

733
01:19:57,558 --> 01:19:59,527
What the fuck is this?
