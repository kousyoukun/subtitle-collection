1
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:53,069
母亲哭了，
And the mother cried,

2
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:56,768
“这就是我在你眼中所看到的自己吗？”
"Is this myself I see, reflected in your eyes?"

3
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,554
女儿说，
And the daughter said,

4
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,861
“我看到的是我吗？你看到的是我吗？”
"Is it me I see, mirrored in yours?"

5
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,619
海伦娜。
Helena.

6
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,404
回来吧。
Come back.

7
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,611
当你回来的时候，她会让你做两倍的家务。
She's going to make you do twice as many chores when you get back.

8
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:43,397
我不介意这笔交易。
I don't mind the trade.

9
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,226
也许如果我们离开够久了，她就会忘记她疯了。
Maybe if we're gone long enough, she'll forget she's mad.

10
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,359
好吧。
Okay.

11
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,841
我们走慢点，小影子。
We'll walk slow, Little Shadow.

12
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,358
它就在这里。
It was here.

13
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,273
跑步还是走路？
Running or walking?

14
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,496
步幅比以前更大了。
The strides are wider than before.

15
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,760
在外面更深的地方。
And deeper on the outsides.

16
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,376
它在运行。
It was running.

17
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,855
为什么？
Why?

18
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,946
因为它害怕什么。
Because it was scared of something.

19
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,426
害怕什么？
Scared of what?

20
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:00,604
我们。
Us.

21
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,043
如果你害怕，
If you were afraid,

22
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,830
逃命，你会去哪里？
running for your life, where would you go?

23
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,853
没人能看到我的地方。
Where no one could see me.

24
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,459
是时候让你完成狩猎了。
It's time you finished the hunt.

25
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,210
如果我打偏了怎么办？
What if I miss?

26
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,691
那我们今晚就挨饿。
Then we go hungry tonight.

27
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,795
我没有发出任何声音。
I didn't make a sound.

28
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,930
你觉得发生了什么事？
So, what do you think happened?

29
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,201
它闻到了我的味道。
It smelled me.

30
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,950
你不需要火了。
You won't need the fire.

31
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:22,006
海伦娜，来拿你今天赚的钱。
Helena, come get what you earned today.

32
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,929
她总是生我的气。
She's always mad at me.

33
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:35,367
哦，你妈妈不能像我们一样看到幸福。
Oh, your mother can't see happiness like we do.

34
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,657
好吧。
Okay.

35
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,006
我很好。
I'm fine.

36
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,095
已经这么晚了。
It's getting late.

37
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,726
海伦娜，别再这样了。
Helena, no more.

38
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,859
剩下的在哪里？
Where's the rest of it?

39
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,295
现在免费了。
It's free now.

40
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,995
它把自己的腿咬下来了？
It chewed its own leg off?

41
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,737
为了生存，牺牲了一切必须的东西。
Sacrificed what it had to, to survive.

42
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,226
我什么时候才能像你一样把我的放在家里？
When can I keep mine in the house like you do?

43
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,881
当你像我一样是个好猎人的时候
When you're as good a hunter as I am.

44
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,274
这将永远不会发生。
Which will be never.

45
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,802
印记上写的是什么？
What do the marks say?

46
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,238
他们说，
They say,

47
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,240
“当你逃离一只愤怒的驼鹿时，
"When you're running from an angry moose,

48
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:19,809
当心低矮的树枝。
beware of low branches."

49
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,225
我听到它在哭。
I heard it crying.

50
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,794
她饿坏了。
She's starving.

51
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,276
好的，我们里面有一些碎屑。我们也许可以...
Well, we have some scraps inside. We could maybe--

52
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,234
当这些都消失了，会发生什么？
What happens when those are gone?

53
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:43,371
没有什么比生存的本能更纯洁的了。
There's nothing more pure than the instinct to survive.

54
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,201
狼毫无怜悯之心。
The wolf holds no pity.

55
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:51,901
只是想再活一天。
Just the desire to live another day.

56
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:55,687
如果你饿了，你会对狼做什么？
What would you do to the wolf, if you were starving?

57
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,953
你是它的猎物。
You're its prey.

58
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,782
我们都是。
We all are.

59
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:11,747
但是孩子呢？
But what about the baby?

60
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,880
将遭受痛苦，孤独而死。
Will suffer and die alone.

61
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,577
现在照我说的做，海伦娜。
Now, do what I say, Helena.

62
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,191
但如果-海伦娜，快走
- But if-- - Helena, move.

63
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,375
你必须永远保护你的家人。
You must always protect your family.

64
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,150
不用了。这是我独自一人的旅行之一。
Nah. This is one of my alone trips.

65
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,457
-但我能帮上忙-不，来吧.你该明白规矩。
- But I can help. - No, come on. You know the rules.

66
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,981
-我会给你一个惊喜的.-什么样的惊喜？
- I'll bring you back a surprise. - What kind of surprise?

67
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:15,811
有点意外，你得等一等才能知道是什么。
Kind of surprise you're gonna have to wait to find out what it is.

68
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,031
现在，到后面去。
Now, get on back there.

69
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,293
我很快就会回家的。
I'll be home soon.

70
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,464
很抱歉来找你麻烦。
Sorry to come ridin' in on you.

71
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,817
你妈妈或爸爸在吗？
Is your mom or dad around?

72
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,128
嘿。
Hey.

73
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,304
希望我没有擅自闯入或什么的。
Hope I'm not trespassing or anything.

74
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,959
我不知道有人住在这么远的地方。
Didn't know anybody lived way out here.

75
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,833
在外面呆了几个小时，我都快晕过去了。我--
Been out for hours, and I got all spun around. I--

76
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,878
我找不到回到小路的路了。
I can't find my way back to the trail.

77
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,579
这里任何地方都没有信号。
No signal out here anywhere.

78
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,843
听着，如果你能指给我看--
Look, if you could just point me toward--

79
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,366
帮助!
Help!

80
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,194
请。在他回来之前。
Please. Before he gets back.

81
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,109
什么？
What?

82
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,765
我们这是在干嘛？
What are we doing?

83
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,332
你--你在干什么？
What are-- What are you doing?

84
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,898
上车，海伦娜。哇。坚持住。
Get on, Helena.[motorist] Whoa. Hang on.

85
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,552
-他很快就会回来。-谁？
- He'll be back soon. - Who?

86
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,641
求求你，我们得走了现在，-我...
- Please, we have to go. Now! - I--

87
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:32,469
-我不想走！-我不能就这么带你走
- I don't wanna go! - I can't just take you.

88
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,080
我甚至不确定我们在哪里。这就是为什么我...
I'm not even sure where we are. That's why I'm--

89
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,871
不是的！
No!

90
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,707
母亲!妈妈，住手！
Mother! Mother, stop!

91
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,015
母亲!妈妈，住手！停止播放!
Mother! Mother, stop! Stop!

92
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,713
海伦娜！-不！
-  Helena! - No!

93
00:16:58,887 --> 00:16:59,844
父亲!
Father!

94
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,588
父亲!
Father!

95
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,503
海伦娜？
Helena?

96
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,027
-父亲！-海伦娜？
-  Father! -  Helena?

97
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,725
不是的！
No!

98
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,034
停止播放!停止播放!
Stop! Stop!

99
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,222
来人呀!
Somebody!

100
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,616
来人呀!
Somebody!

101
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,200
看看谁醒了。
Look who's awake.

102
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,506
没关系的，海伦娜。
It's okay, Helena.

103
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,727
你妈妈就在隔壁房间。
Your mother's just in the next room.

104
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,685
我父亲在哪里？
Where's my father?

105
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:45,298
他不在这里。你现在安全了。
He's not here. You're safe now.

106
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,343
再也没有什么好怕的了。
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

107
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,825
别担心那件事。
Don't worry about that.

108
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:05,796
海伦娜。
Helena.

109
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,236
我们不应该在这里。我想回家。
We shouldn't be here. I want to go home.

110
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,761
-那不是我们的家-你做了什么？
- That wasn't our home. - What did you do?

111
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,939
你干什么了？
What did you do?

112
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,724
-我要爸爸.他不可能靠近我们。
- I want Father. He can't be near us.

113
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,074
再也不会了。
Ever again.

114
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,861
他带走了我，海伦娜。
He took me, Helena.

115
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,124
雅各布。
Jacob...

116
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,475
绑架了我，把我带到了树林里。
kidnapped me and took me to the woods.

117
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,085
你在说谎。
You're lying.

118
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,437
你是个骗子。你一直都是个骗子。
You're a liar. You have always been a liar.

119
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,829
父亲告诉我的。
Father told me.

120
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,877
别哭了！
Stop crying!

121
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,879
你不能这么做。
You're not allowed to do that.

122
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,707
我们需要让你母亲休息一下。
We need to let your mother rest.

123
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,665
就几分钟。
Just for a few minutes.

124
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,842
我们会没事的。海伦娜？
We'll be okay. Helena?

125
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,341
父亲?
Father?

126
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,185
-谁出局了？-是的
-  Who's out? -  Yeah.

127
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,394
好了，我们得走了。赶快。
Okay, we have to go. Come on.

128
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,531
你做得很好。赶快。
You did good. Come on.

129
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,057
好的，我们走这边。
Okay, let's go this way.

130
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,147
-他来了！-警察！不许动!
-  There he is! -  Police! Don't move!

131
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,584
我们要回家吗？
Are we gonna go home?

132
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:05,846
总有一天我们会的。
One day we will.

133
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,674
嘿!不许动!
Hey! Don't move!

134
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,505
离那女孩远点。
Back away from the girl.

135
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,594
不是的！趴在地上！
No! On your stomach!

136
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,117
现在!
Now!

137
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,771
他没有做错任何事。
He didn't do anything wrong.

138
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,773
让我看到你的手。
Let me see your hands.

139
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,863
我会来找你的，小影子。
I'll come find you, Little Shadow.

140
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,126
他在跑！我抓到他了！
He's running! I got him!

141
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,128
把手放在背后！-爸爸！
Hands behind your back! - Daddy!

142
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,629
开枪吧。
Shoot.

143
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,109
别跑了，玛丽戈德。
No running, Marigold.

144
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,418
嗨，甜心。
Hi, sweetie.

145
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:27,291
哈弗太太说她有自己的生活，如果你要迟到，
Mrs. Haver said she has a life of her own, and if you're gonna be late,

146
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,946
她要开始向你收取房租了。
she's gonna start charging you rent for me.

147
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,514
是吗？[玛丽戈德]这是什么意思？
She did, huh?[Marigold] What does that mean?

148
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,865
这意味着你很有价值，她认为我应该为你买单。
It means you are so valuable, she thinks I should pay for you.

149
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,693
你在这里发现了什么？
Whatcha got here?

150
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,000
我的科学项目。这是栖息地。[海伦娜]嗯。
My science project. It's a habitat.[Helena] Uh-huh.

151
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,785
栖息地？这个栖息地是给谁的？
Habitat? Who's the habitat for?

152
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,005
一只小鹿。
A baby deer.

153
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:49,444
它睡在这里，在岩石旁边，以确保它不被猎人猎杀。
It sleeps over here, beside the rocks, to keep it safe from hunters.

154
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,011
聪明的鹿。
Smart deer.

155
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,057
妈咪！
Mommy!

156
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,278
这是什么叶子？
What kind of leaf is this?

157
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,454
一颗核桃。
A walnut.

158
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,935
-从哪棵树？-你告诉我.
- From which tree? - You tell me.

159
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:03,980
那里。
There.

160
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,199
嗯-嗯。
Mm-hmm.

161
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,331
那棵树是什么？
And what's that tree?

162
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,681
一棵红橡树。
A red oak.

163
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,683
在我看来它不是红色的。
It doesn't look red to me.

164
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,380
它将在秋季举行。
It will be in the fall.

165
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,816
你看到那只鸟了吗？
Do you see the bird?

166
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,124
一只森林画眉鸟。
A wood thrush.

167
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,735
你怎么知道所有人的名字？
How do you know all the names?

168
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,346
如果你愿意，我可以教你。
I can teach you if you want.

169
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,305
我能看到一只兔子。
I can see a bunny rabbit.

170
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,307
哪里?
Where?

171
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:30,311
你必须稍微倾斜一下你的头。看到耳朵了吗？
You have to kind of tilt your head. See the ears?

172
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:33,009
哦，是啊。我看到它了。尾巴往下走吗？
Oh, yeah. I see it. With the tail down this way?

173
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:34,228
嗯。
Yeah.

174
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:40,190
这意味着我们是一体的。
It means that we're one.

175
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,585
一家人。
Family.

176
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:45,848
妈妈?
Mom?

177
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,591
我什么时候能吃到这个？
When can I have one of these?

178
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:51,375
直到你82岁的时候。
Not until you're 82 years old.

179
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,116
这是规则，记得吗？
That's the rule, remember?

180
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,683
那是不公平的。
That's not fair.

181
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,859
你年轻的时候就有了。
You got them when you were young.

182
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,862
我比你大很多，我希望我没有。
I was much older than you, and I wish I hadn't.

183
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,256
我喜欢他们。
I like them.

184
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,431
我喜欢你。
I like you.

185
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,229
爸爸回来了！
Daddy's home!

186
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,364
把你的东西放进去，亲爱的。
Put your stuff inside, sweetie.

187
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,584
我们要去校园参加爸爸的工作野餐。
We're going to the campus for Daddy's work picnic.

188
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,107
野餐吗-抱歉我们来晚了
-  Picnic? - Sorry we're late.

189
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:28,412
我忘了你今晚的事了。
I forgot about your thing tonight.

190
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,763
没关系。我们走吧。
That's all right. Let's just go.

191
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,504
我得换衣服了。你为什么不和她一起过去，我一会儿就来。
I have to change. Why don't you go on over with her, and I'll come later.

192
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,419
嗯，我们已经试过了。你从来没出现过。
Well, we've tried that. You never show.

193
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,639
我只是不擅长这些事情。-我也不是
I'm just not good - at those things. - Neither am I.

194
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,728
这就是为什么你要和我一起去。
Which is why you're coming with.

195
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:42,078
另外，你是我美丽的妻子，我想炫耀你。
Plus, you're my beautiful wife, and I want to show you off.

196
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,957
你知道吗，这很有趣。
You know, it's funny.

197
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,959
谢谢。
Thank you.

198
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,874
-嘿，你还好吗？-是的。
- Hey, you good? - Yeah.

199
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,702
玛丽戈德玩得开心吗？
Is Marigold having fun?

200
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,312
我不知道。最疯狂的是，
I don't know. The crazy thing is,

201
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,183
我的学生甚至不再试图隐藏它了。
my students don't even try to hide it anymore.

202
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:02,185
我整堂课的电话都响了。
Phones are going off my entire lecture.

203
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,927
好吧，为他们辩护，我听过你的一些演讲。
Well, in their defense, I have heard some of your lectures.

204
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:11,151
我喜欢那样。这很不寻常。
I love that. It's unusual.

205
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,197
-哦，谢谢.你是在这附近买的吗？
- Oh, thanks. Did you get it around here?

206
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:16,591
呃，在旧金山，我十几岁的时候。
Uh, in San Francisco, when I was a teenager.

207
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,638
你有一堆这样的人。
You have a bunch of them.

208
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,291
太多了。
Too many.

209
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,903
我不知道你是旧金山人。
I didn't know you're from San Francisco.

210
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:27,341
其他地方也是。-我们经常搬家。-你的父母是做什么的？
Other places too. - We moved around a lot. - What'd your parents do?

211
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,257
我父亲在保险业工作，我母亲有时做电话营销。
My father worked in insurance, my mom sometimes did telemarketing.

212
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,825
没有比这更无聊的了。
Doesn't get much more boring than that.

213
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,396
然后她拿出20个床垫，把它们放在豌豆上。
"Then she took 20 mattresses and laid them on the pea.

214
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,965
在这件事上，公主不得不躺了一整夜。
On this, the princess had to lie all night.

215
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,838
早上，有人问她睡得怎么样。
In the morning she was asked how she had slept.

216
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,448
公主说..。
And the princess said...

217
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,716
‘’哦，非常糟糕。‘’
'‘Oh, very badly.'"

218
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,091
到底怎么回事？我女儿在哪里？
What's going on? Where's my daughter?

219
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,092
海伦娜·埃里克森？
Helena Erikkson?

220
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,876
玛丽戈德在哪里？
Where's Marigold?

221
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,443
她不在这里。这不是关于她的。
She's not here. This isn't about her.

222
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,532
我是特别探员伊林。
I'm Special Agent Illing.

223
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,534
你在我家做什么？
What are you doing in my house?

224
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,015
-埃里克森女士。-我叫佩尔蒂埃.
- Ms. Erikkson. - My name is Pelletier.

225
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:45,800
在那之前，是琼斯，对吗？
Before that, it was Jones, correct?

226
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,629
然后是米切尔，在你把它从贝库姆改过来之后。
Then Mitchell, after you changed it from Bekkum.

227
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:52,067
但你是雅各布·霍尔布鲁克和贝丝·埃里克森的孩子。
But you were born to Jacob Holbrook and Beth Erikkson.

228
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,417
你想要什么？
What do you want?

229
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:57,116
你父亲雅各布·霍尔布鲁克。
Your father, Jacob Holbrook.

230
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,292
他和另一名囚犯昨晚越狱了
He and another prisoner escaped last night

231
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,556
在被送往阿尔杰监狱的过程中。
while being transported across the state line to Alger Penitentiary.

232
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,080
你最后一次和他说话是什么时候？
When's the last time you spoke to him?

233
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:08,127
当我十岁的时候。
When I was ten years old.

234
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,433
-他最近有没有试着联系你？-没有
- Has he tried to contact you recently? - No.

235
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,218
真的吗？一次都没有？
Are you sure? Not even once?

236
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,481
你本可以打电话给我的。你不需要来这里。
You could've called me. You didn't need to come here.

237
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:15,830
到底怎么回事？
What's going on?

238
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,833
你还好吗？
You okay?

239
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,530
你知道你父亲可能要去哪里吗？
Do you know where your father might be going?

240
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,576
你的父亲？
Y-Your father?

241
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,839
你不能就这样闯进我的房子。
You can't just come into my house.

242
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,015
我们的搜查令允许我们检查任何可能的通讯
Our warrant allows us to check for any possible communication

243
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,756
给你父亲或从你父亲那里。
to or from your father.

244
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,801
你为什么一直这么说？海伦娜的父亲
Why do you keep saying that? Helena's father--

245
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,629
他不知道我住在哪里，也不知道我姓什么，
He doesn't know where I live, doesn't know my last name,

246
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,893
对我一无所知。
doesn't know anything about me.

247
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,112
你的家人和朋友也是这样吗？你有没有--
And that's same for your family and friends? Have any of your--

248
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,680
我从没告诉过任何人雅各布·霍尔布鲁克是我父亲。
I've never told anyone Jacob Holbrook is my father.

249
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:44,467
所以，20年。
So, 20 years.

250
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:48,080
没有信，没有生日卡，什么都没有？
No letter, birthday card, anything?

251
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,081
不是的。
No.

252
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,778
我很困惑。
I'm confused.

253
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:52,432
我还以为你父母死于车祸呢。
I thought your parents died in a car accident.

254
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,956
我就是这么跟你说的。
That's what I told you.

255
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,176
还有霍尔布鲁克，他就是马什·金。就是刚刚逃走的那个。
And Holbrook, that's the Marsh King guy. The one that just escaped.

256
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,873
我在收音机里听到的。
I heard it on the radio.

257
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,528
没错。
That's right.

258
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,182
他来这里有风险吗？
Is there any risk of him coming here?

259
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:04,618
这就是我们想要找出的。
That's what we're trying to find out.

260
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,620
他不知道我住在哪里。
He doesn't know where I live.

261
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,231
哦，你不能太肯定这一点。
Oh, you can't be too sure of that.

262
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,320
天哪，海伦娜。你怎么能不告诉我呢？
Christ, Helena. How could you not have told me?

263
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,062
我告诉过你待在车里的，亲爱的。
I told you to stay in the car, sweetie.

264
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,935
-这些人是谁？-警察他们只是...
- Who are these people? - Police. They're just--

265
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,719
我要带她去。我晚些时候给你打电话。
I'm gonna take her. I'll call you later.

266
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,986
我们需要看看你的手机和你用过的电脑。
We're gonna need to see your phone and any computers you use.

267
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,119
如果运气好的话，你父亲很快就会被找到。
With any luck, your father will be found soon.

268
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,078
你不了解我父亲。
You don't know my father.

269
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:34,300
如果他能去野外，你就再也见不到他了。
If he makes it to the wild, you'll never see him again.

270
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,911
在这起在全国范围内臭名昭著的案件中，
In a case that received nationwide notoriety,

271
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,175
雅各布·霍尔布鲁克，所谓的“沼泽之王”，绑架了贝丝·埃里克森
Jacob Holbrook, the so-called "Marsh King," abducted Beth Erikkson

272
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,264
把她关了12年
and held her for 12 years

273
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:43,570
在密歇根州上半岛的荒野中，
in the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula,

274
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,789
直到她最终逃脱
until she eventually escaped

275
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,314
和她在囚禁期间生下的女儿在一起。
with the daughter she gave birth to while in captivity.

276
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,969
审判结束后，埃里克森很难适应正常生活
After the trial, Erikkson had difficulty adapting to normal life

277
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:53,232
很少在公共场合露面。
and was rarely seen in public.

278
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,886
不幸的是，她在四年前死于明显的自杀。
Tragically, she died four years ago in an apparent suicide.

279
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,305
嗯?
Yeah?

280
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,829
你们要回家吗？
You guys coming home?

281
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,919
我订了一间旅馆的房间过夜。玛丽在泳池里。
I grabbed a hotel room for the night. Mari's in the pool.

282
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:32,967
如果你愿意，我可以给她带些校服过来。
I could bring her over some school clothes, if you want.

283
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,752
我明天不让她进来，以防万一。
I'm keeping her out tomorrow, just in case.

284
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,625
我没想到会发生这种事。
I didn't think this would happen.

285
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,974
我会发现的吗？
That I'd find out?

286
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,411
不是的。我是说，我希望我...
No. I mean, I wish I--

287
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,022
玛丽在喊我。我得走了。
Mari's yelling for me. I gotta go.

288
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,415
小影子。
Little Shadow.

289
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,156
是时候检查我们的陷阱了。
Time to check our snares.

290
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,984
一个真正的猎人..。
And a real hunter...

291
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,119
需要一把真刀。
needs a real knife.

292
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:25,993
现在这是你的了。
This is yours now.

293
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,692
让我们看看你是怎么处理它的。
Let's see how you do with it.

294
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,172
嗨。
Hi.

295
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,089
我早些时候打过电话，但你没接。
I called earlier, but you didn't answer.

296
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,657
我不太会用手机。
I'm not great with phones.

297
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:34,094
这是轻描淡写的。
That's an understatement.

298
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,792
我看了新闻。
I saw the news.

299
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,317
我想我应该下来打个招呼。
Thought I'd shoot down and say hello.

300
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,928
你好，克拉克。
Hello, Clark.

301
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:45,279
也许在我回去之前喝一杯水。
Maybe grab a glass of water before I head back.

302
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,122
我知道你不想让我去拜访你，
I know you don't want me dropping in,

303
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,516
但我觉得现在一切都变了。
but I figured everything's changed a bit now.

304
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,432
猫已经从袋子里跑出来了。
Cat's outta the bag.

305
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,085
你丈夫对此反应如何？
How's your husband taking it?

306
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,652
不太好。
Not well.

307
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:13,220
他会回心转意。这只是个时间问题。
He'll come around. Just a matter of time.

308
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,745
小个子已经不是那么小了。
The little one's not so little anymore.

309
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,706
你母亲会很高兴见到她的。
Your mother would've loved to have met her.

310
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:25,058
我以为你会把玛丽戈德带回家一段时间，
I thought you might bring Marigold up home a while back,

311
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,277
至少在葬礼上是这样。
at least for the funeral.

312
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,236
那时她也不会遇到她。
She wouldn't have met her then either.

313
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,282
的确如此。
That's true enough.

314
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,546
那么，我想我是说我希望你早点来。
Then, I guess I meant I wish you woulda come sooner.

315
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,852
她会喜欢的。
She would've liked that.

316
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:43,685
他还在大学里干那份工作吗？
He still has that job at the college?

317
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,559
你还在做什么--什么都没变。
You still doing--Nothing's changed.

318
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:50,257
好吧。
Okay.

319
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,565
这不是我所看到的结果。
This is not how I saw this playing out.

320
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:58,047
抱歉，我现在不能这么做。
I'm sorry, I just can't do this right now.

321
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,144
好吧，至少媒体上没有报道。
Well, at least it's not in the press.

322
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,105
没人会把你和他放在一起。
No one's putting you with him.

323
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,542
只是想确定你不会担心一些事情。
Just wanted to make sure you weren't worried about things.

324
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,805
我没有。
I'm not.

325
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:23,159
你知道，在你13岁左右的时候有一段时间。
You know, there was a space when you were about 13 or so.

326
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:27,294
我以为我们有机会成为一个美好的小家庭，我们三个人。
I thought we had a shot at bein' a nice little family, the three of us.

327
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,645
从来不是我们三个，克拉克。
It was never the three of us, Clark.

328
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,735
她不想让我在她身边。
She didn't want me around.

329
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,824
当她看着我的时候，她看到了我的父亲。
When she looked at me, she saw my father.

330
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,609
你也是。
So did you.

331
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,698
不是的。
No.

332
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,439
你忘记了一些美好的日子。
You're forgetting some good days.

333
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,006
她爱你。
She loved you.

334
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:46,313
我还爱你。
I still love you.

335
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,011
我想念你。
I miss you.

336
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,321
但当然，也许有时我们在你身上看到了一点雅各布。
But sure, maybe sometimes we saw a little Jacob in you.

337
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,368
或许你在我身上看到的他还不够多。
Or maybe you never saw enough of him in me.

338
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:08,857
你是来解救这家伙的吗？[警官]不，我应该--
You here to relieve this fella?[officer] No, I'm supposed to--

339
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:12,557
佩尔蒂埃夫人，联邦调查局希望你到办公室来一趟。
Mrs. Pelletier, the FBI would like you to come down to the office.

340
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:13,993
出什么事了吗？
Did something come up?

341
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,342
远远超出了我的工资等级。
Way above my pay grade.

342
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,084
你想让我和你一起去吗？
You want me to come with you?

343
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,609
我们发现了你父亲的身体。
We found your father's body.

344
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,091
就在州界之内。
Just inside the state line.

345
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:28,137
我们推测他们当时正前往加拿大的一个口岸。
We assume they were heading for a crossing to Canada.

346
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,705
60英尺高的堤坝上的护栏被撕裂。
Guard rail, 60 feet up on the embankment was splintered.

347
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:33,142
司机要么失控，要么睡着了。
Driver either lost control or fell asleep.

348
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,580
汽车撞到一棵树上起火了。
The car hit a tree and caught fire.

349
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:38,234
两人都被烧得面目全非。
Both men were burned beyond recognition.

350
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,194
我们认为他们有同伙。我们现在正在找他。
We think they had an accomplice. We're looking for him now.

351
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,240
你怎么能确定是霍尔布鲁克？
How can you be sure it's Holbrook?

352
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:52,248
他有三颗金牙，雕刻的图案和你父亲一模一样。
He has three gold teeth with carvings matching your father.

353
00:41:58,777 --> 00:41:59,778
你还好吗？
You all right?

354
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:04,696
我父亲20年前去世了。
My father died 20 years ago.

355
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,166
嗯。
Mmm.

356
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,604
你爸爸的事我很抱歉。
I'm sorry about your daddy.

357
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:46,041
我们在电视上看到了。
We saw it on TV.

358
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:49,479
谢谢你，亲爱的，但他不是我爸爸很长一段时间。
Thank you, sweetie, but he wasn't my daddy for a long time.

359
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:52,482
我们给你带了点吃的以防你不想做饭。
We brought you some food in case you didn't wanna cook.

360
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:56,095
让我猜猜，多加了意大利香肠？
Let me guess, extra pepperoni?

361
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:59,054
- 我很想吃披萨。- 是的！
- I'm definitely in the mood for pizza. - Yes!

362
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,016
你好吗？
How you doing?

363
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:05,757
我很好。
I'm fine.

364
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:12,241
我希望你能告诉我真相
I wish you would've told me the truth.

365
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,723
最坏的结果是什么？
What's the worst that could've happened?

366
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:19,988
- 我们就不会有玛丽了- 你又不知道
- We wouldn't have Mari. - You don't know that.

367
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,904
是的
Yes, I do.

368
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:26,647
哪个正常的人会和他女儿有关系...
Who in their right mind would get involved with the daughter...

369
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:30,869
如果你知道我叫霍尔布鲁克，你就不会和我约会了。
If you knew my name was Holbrook, you'd never have gone on a date with me.

370
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:32,740
你会从另一条路逃跑的
You would've run the other way.

371
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,569
- 你现在会了。- 等等
- You will now. - Hold on.

372
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,182
假装我比你想象的要好，好吗？
Let's pretend that I'm a better person than you think I am, all right?

373
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,271
最好的事情是什么？
What's the best thing that could've happened?

374
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,927
你也许找到了可以信任的人。
You might've found somebody to trust.

375
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:50,366
一个能帮你度过所有糟糕日子的人
Someone to help you through all the shitty days.

376
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,934
找个人解释你那些奇怪的纹身。
Somebody to explain all your weird tattoos to.

377
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,247
最好的永远不会发生，斯蒂芬。
The best never happens, Stephen.

378
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,684
不管我们有多想要。
No matter how badly we want it.

379
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,013
- 玛丽戈德没事吧- 是啊
- Marigold okay? - Yeah.

380
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:29,275
她睡着了
She's asleep.

381
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,147
你真的相信吗？
Do you really believe that?

382
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:36,369
你之前说的...
What you said before about...

383
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:39,851
最好的永远不会发生。
the best never happening.

384
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:44,246
因为如果你这么做了，那对我们意味着什么？
Because if you do, what's that mean for us?

385
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:51,558
我不想让你更难过
Look I-- I don't wanna make this any worse for you.

386
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,126
但你得让我进去海伦娜
But you gotta let me in, Helena.

387
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,874
好吧听着我要去办公室工作了。
Okay, look. I'm gonna go do some work at the office.

388
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,529
可能睡在那边。
Probably sleep over there.

389
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,012
我叫海伦娜·霍尔布鲁克。
My name is Helena Holbrook.

390
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,756
还记得绑架那个女人的人吗
Remember the guy who kidnapped that woman?

391
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,194
大家都叫他沼泽王
The one everybody called The Marsh King?

392
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:05,240
我是他女儿。
I'm his daughter.

393
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:16,599
有时候我晚上一个人偷偷溜出去因为我觉得被困住了。
Sometimes I sneak off alone at night because I feel trapped.

394
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,778
就像我不知道我到底属于哪个世界。
Like I can't figure out which world I really belong in.

395
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:29,525
我很难相信别人因为...
I have trouble trusting people because...

396
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:34,617
每个人都说我最信任的人
everyone tells me the person I believed in the most

397
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:36,837
真是个怪物
was really a monster.

398
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,540
我第一次杀人后他给了我这个。
He gave me this after my first kill.

399
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,770
这一次我失手了
And this one when I missed.

400
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:01,949
这是他教我游泳的地方。
This is the place he taught me to swim.

401
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,958
他给我的名字。
The name he gave me.

402
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,572
这是为了提醒我不要等着做家务。
This to remind me never to wait to do my chores.

403
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:25,016
这是我父亲唯一想看到的眼泪。
These were the only tears my father ever wanted to see.

404
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:32,632
你愿意和我约会吗？
Would you like to go out on a date with me?

405
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,533
赶快。我知道。[玛丽戈德]我能做到。
Come on. I know.[Marigold] I can do it.

406
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:06,927
我一直期待着这一天的到来。
I have been looking forward to this day.

407
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:09,364
我想是时候把你们介绍给几个人了。
Thought it was time to introduce you to a couple people.

408
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:11,584
看，爸爸，他们有马。
Look, Daddy, they have horses.

409
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:15,066
这是克拉克。他会尽最大努力让你叫他爷爷。
This is Clark. He's gonna try his best to get you to call him Grandpa.

410
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,763
让他自己挣来。
Make him earn it.

411
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,983
我一点也不害怕。
That doesn't scare me a bit.

412
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:20,810
我没有其他人可以把它花在身上。
I've got no one else to spend it on.

413
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:23,291
很高兴见到你，玛丽戈德。
It is very nice to meet you, Marigold.

414
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,684
你也是，克拉克。
You too, Clark.

415
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:27,730
我会喜欢这件的。
I'm gonna like this one.

416
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
你想看看马吗？
Would you like to see the horses?

417
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:31,577
谁饿了？
Who's getting hungry?

418
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:43,676
在我拍了两个小时后，
Two hours after I took that,

419
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,287
我开始接到电话说有个流氓
I started getting calls that some hoodlum

420
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:49,029
在人们的院子里放烟花。
was setting off fireworks in people's yards.

421
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:52,293
她从我的一个副手身边跑开，把那条裙子撕成了碎片。
She tore that dress to shreds, running from one of my deputies.

422
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,339
你可以停下来了。
You can stop now.

423
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,384
哦，见鬼，我们还没到你的困难阶段呢。
Oh, hell, we haven't even got to your difficult stage yet.

424
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,082
那是谁？
Who's that?

425
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:02,347
那是你奶奶。
That's your grandmother.

426
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:05,872
你一定长得很像她。
You definitely take after her.

427
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:10,137
我不记得那张照片了。
I don't remember that picture.

428
00:50:10,311 --> 00:50:12,052
它看起来像我们。
It looks like us.

429
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,321
你知道，如果这成为一种习惯，我不会抱怨。
You know, I wouldn't complain if this became a habit.

430
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,417
谢谢你，克拉克。
Thank you, Clark.

431
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,202
随时都行。
Anytime.

432
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:33,813
嘿。
Hey.

433
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:37,164
你知道吗，雅各布夺走了我们很多人的信仰，
You know, Jacob took a lot of my people's beliefs,

434
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,515
把它们拧成适合他的样子。
twisted 'em to fit what suited him.

435
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,913
在奥吉布瓦的意思是“拥有”。不是“家人”
Means "owned" in Ojibwa. Not "family."

436
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:48,958
不要把这两者混淆了。
Don't confuse the two.

437
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:21,948
嘘--
Sh--

438
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:56,243
小影子。
Little Shadow.

439
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:12,738
怎么了？
What's wrong?

440
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:19,832
我只是去拿点水。
I'm just getting some water.

441
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:32,312
嘿，进屋时一定要擦干净你的鞋。
Hey, make sure you wipe your feet when you come in the house.

442
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:33,531
我做到了。
I did.

443
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:35,968
我会在路上让她下车。
I'll drop her on the way.

444
00:54:36,621 --> 00:54:38,144
回头见。
See you after.

445
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:40,233
-我们去游泳什么的。-别忘了我的护目镜。
- We'll go swimming or something. - Don't forget my goggles.

446
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:42,583
我今天下午在底特律参加了一个会议。
I got that conference in Detroit this afternoon.

447
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:43,758
可能会很晚才回家。
Might be home late.

448
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,239
-你会没事吧？-嗯.
- You gonna be okay? - Mmm.

449
00:54:57,859 --> 00:54:58,860
谢谢。
Thank you.

450
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,432
海伦娜？
Helena?

451
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,825
你好吗？
How you doing?

452
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:09,436
好的。很好。
Good. Fine.

453
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,395
你们这周末在附近吗？
Are you guys around this weekend?

454
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:14,006
我在想Jess和Marigold可以有个玩伴。
I was thinking Jess and Marigold could have a playdate.

455
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,662
哦，是啊。我想我们自由了，只是..。
Oh, yeah. I think we're free, just...

456
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,625
抱歉的。是啊，她会喜欢的。
Sorry. Yeah, she'd love that.

457
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,236
星期六怎么样？
How's Saturday? Would she like to come over to our place?

458
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,501
当然了。她一直游到10点，但在那之后...
Of course. She has swim until 10:00 but after that...

459
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,993
你能等一下吗？抱歉的。
Can you hold on a second? Sorry.

460
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:05,030
你这是在帮倒忙。
You're not helping.

461
00:57:05,204 --> 00:57:08,816
我不应该帮你的。这是你的作业，不是我的。
I'm not supposed to help. This is your homework, not mine.

462
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,296
但你总是帮我。
But you always help.

463
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,298
你可以想办法的
Well, you can figure this out.

464
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:15,432
你怎么又心情不好了？
Why are you in a bad mood again?

465
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:17,042
我没有我
I'm not.

466
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:19,566
我不是故意的。
I don't mean to be.

467
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:24,005
我们去看书吧。我们会让爸爸早上帮我们完成的
Let's go read. We'll get Daddy to help us finish in the morning.

468
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,790
- 好吗？- 好吧
- Okay? - Okay.

469
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:32,797
“睡莲铺满了水池的表面
"Water lilies spread over the surface of the pool

470
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:35,756
就像一张有花图案的地毯。
like a carpet patterned with flowers.

471
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,194
而在这地毯上，躺着一个年轻美丽的女人。
And on this carpet, lay a young and beautiful woman.

472
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:44,678
母亲哭了，“这是我自己，我看到的，反映在你的眼睛？”
The mother cried, '‘Is this myself I see, reflected in your eyes?'

473
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:46,245
女儿说...”
And the daughter said..."

474
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:51,772
嘿，女儿？你错过了入场。
Hey, daughter? You missed your entrance.

475
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,506
海伦娜
Helena.

476
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:43,998
-  什么事？- 是个洋娃娃。
-  What is it? - It's a doll.

477
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:47,567
你拿着它玩
You-- You play with it.

478
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:49,656
像朋友一样。
Like a friend.

479
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:57,490
她的头发和我一样。
She has hair like me.

480
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:00,101
小小的海伦娜。
A tiny Helena.

481
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:26,057
天啊
Oh, God.

482
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,582
玛丽戈德
Marigold!

483
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,283
海伦娜
Helena!

484
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:36,720
嘿是我
Hey, it's me.

485
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:38,112
是我
It's me.

486
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,421
天啊你在...
Jesus. What are you...

487
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:45,467
呃...那是谁的血
Uh... I--Whose blood is that?

488
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,819
没有人的。兔我听到外面有人。
No one's. A rabbit. I heard somebody outside.

489
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:50,777
也许可以报警
Maybe try calling the police

490
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:53,606
而不是在黑暗中拿着刀到处跑
instead of running around in the dark with a knife.

491
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,566
-  我得去看看玛丽戈德- 玛丽戈德很好她睡着了
-  I have to check on Marigold. - Marigold's fine. She's asleep.

492
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:58,872
我刚离开她的房间。
I just left her room.

493
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:00,831
你看到有人在外面吗？
Did you see anyone out there?

494
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,357
嘿
Hey.

495
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,751
我们要把门锁上，好吗？
We're gonna keep the doors locked, all right?

496
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,448
派几辆警车巡逻。
Get a few cop cars on patrol.

497
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,147
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

498
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:45,614
它的头在流血。
It was bleeding from the head.

499
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:48,922
就像有人先杀了它，然后把它放进陷阱里。
Like someone killed it first, then put it in the snare.

500
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:53,057
或者它以其他方式受伤了。
Or maybe it got injured some other way.

501
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:57,496
什么事吓到你了？为什么你觉得还有别的事？
What's got you spooked? Why do you think there's something more?

502
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,020
我觉得他就在这里。
I feel like he's here.

503
01:02:00,194 --> 01:02:02,893
你找到我们的那晚
The night you found us,

504
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:04,721
当我们走出森林时，
when we came out of the woods,

505
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:07,332
我很害怕因为他不在我身边。
I was so afraid because he wasn't there with me.

506
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:10,378
但他来了。
But then he came.

507
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,163
别迷失了方向海伦娜
Don't get lost in this, Helena.

508
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:14,208
现在他又回来了。
Now he's come back again.

509
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:17,037
我得告诉他别烦我们。
I have to tell him to leave us alone.

510
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,040
你得试着把他从你的脑海中抹去。
You have got to try to get him out of your head.

511
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:21,346
永远
For good.

512
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,696
我不确定我能做到。
I'm not sure I can do that.

513
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,437
他怎么可能还活着？
How could he be alive?

514
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,221
我不知道
I don't know.

515
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,188
没有什么比生存的本能更纯洁的了。
There's nothing purer than the instinct to survive.

516
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:02,039
妈妈！
Mommy!

517
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,045
玛丽戈德
Marigold?

518
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,745
我找不到我的背包了。
I couldn't find my backpack.

519
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,750
哦，不。那个留在这里。
Oh, no, no, no. That stays here.

520
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,535
我想展示给人们看。
I wanna show people.

521
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,581
我们再等等，好吗？
Let's wait a while on that, okay?

522
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:23,974
好吧
Okay.

523
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,507
你从哪弄来的
Where did you get those?

524
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:38,336
我以为是你做的。我喜欢他们。
I thought you made them. I like them.

525
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,120
看起来像你和我。
Looks like you and me.

526
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,873
栖息地一直都在你的房间里吗？
Has the habitat been in your room the whole time?

527
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:56,136
嗯-嗯。
Mm-hmm.

528
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,025
你干吗呢？
What are you doing?

529
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,905
赶快。
Come on.

530
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:32,912
放学后呆在家里，除非爸爸
Stay inside after school unless Daddy

531
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:37,134
否则我就在这里，好吗？不管别人说什么，都不要和别人一起去。
or I are here, okay? Don't go with anyone else, no matter what they say.

532
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,335
这是怎么回事？
What's this about?

533
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:05,902
我就是有这种感觉。
Just felt like it.

534
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:08,687
你放学后能去接玛丽戈德吗？
Can you pick Marigold up after school?

535
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:10,863
当然了。
Of course.

536
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:12,517
为什么？
Why?

537
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:17,174
我得做点什么。我不能告诉你这是什么。
I have to do something. I can't tell you what it is.

538
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:25,269
怎么了，海伦娜？
What's going on, Helena?

539
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:30,448
我知道我没有给你任何理由...
I know I haven't given you any reason to...

540
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:33,538
请相信我。
please trust me.

541
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:36,367
我回来后会给你打电话的。
I'll call you when I get back.

542
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,804
从哪里回来？
Back from where?

543
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:41,807
最后一个秘密，斯蒂芬。
Last secret, Stephen.

544
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:44,070
我保证。
Promise.

545
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,658
你和玛丽救了我。
You and Mari rescued me.

546
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:13,263
我可以随心所欲地叫它？
I can call it anything I want?

547
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:15,917
这是你的了。我把它给你了。
It's yours. I gave it to you.

548
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,140
我给它起名
I name it

549
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:23,664
海伦娜瀑布。
Helena Falls.

550
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,270
你好，小影子。
Hello, Little Shadow.

551
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:17,751
我们去散散步吧。
Let's go for a walk.

552
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,815
你怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

553
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,773
我从未失去过你，小影子。
I never lost you, Little Shadow.

554
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:53,309
我好怀念那股味道。
I miss that smell.

555
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,052
还有它的味道。
And the taste.

556
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:03,014
把那个给我。
Gimme that.

557
01:12:15,548 --> 01:12:16,941
我最喜欢的刀。
My favorite knife.

558
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,574
我们以前常来这里露营，你还记得吗？
We used to come camping up here, you remember?

559
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:45,578
我们整个夏天都在这里躺着。
We'd lay out here all summer long.

560
01:12:45,752 --> 01:12:47,145
抬头仰望天空，
Look up at the sky,

561
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:48,668
看看谁能数出最多的流星。
see who could count the most shooting stars.

562
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:51,584
我过去经常作弊和数飞机。
I used to cheat and count airplanes.

563
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:59,070
你一直都知道我还活着，不是吗？
You knew I was alive the whole time, didn't you?

564
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:01,725
我不知道这怎么可能。
I didn't know how it was possible.

565
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:05,250
直到我看到一只三条腿的郊狼。
Not until I saw a three-legged coyote.

566
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,210
为了自由牺牲了自己的腿。
Sacrificed its own leg for freedom.

567
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,561
就像你牺牲了你的牙齿。
Like you sacrificed your teeth.

568
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,693
阿。
Ah.

569
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:16,087
可能不会通过体检，
Probably won't pass a medical exam,

570
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:18,176
但它为你赢得了你需要的时间。
but it bought you the time you needed.

571
01:13:20,004 --> 01:13:21,397
你做了一些调查。
You did some digging.

572
01:13:22,267 --> 01:13:23,747
9~10成熟。
Well done.

573
01:13:29,274 --> 01:13:31,450
你没有告诉任何人你的理论吗？
You didn't tell anyone else your theory?

574
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:34,932
你有没有?
Did you?

575
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,243
真希望你带了玛丽戈德来。
Wish you'd brought Marigold.

576
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:45,595
跟我说说我的孙女吧。
Tell me about my granddaughter.

577
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:49,381
我不这样认为。你对她的了解已经够多了。
I don't think so. You know enough about her already.

578
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,604
好吧，我得偷偷看一眼。
Well, I had to take a peek.

579
01:13:57,084 --> 01:13:58,869
你从来没带她来看过我。
You never brought her to visit me.

580
01:14:00,827 --> 01:14:02,438
你根本没来看我。
You didn't visit me at all.

581
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:08,313
来吧，小影子。
Come on, Little Shadow.

582
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,880
我要给你看点儿东西。
I want to show you something.

583
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:15,886
你知道吗，玛丽戈德长得很像她。
You know, Marigold looks like her.

584
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:17,670
你的母亲。
Your mother.

585
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:20,847
我打赌她和我们一样喜欢水。
I bet she loves the water as much as we do.

586
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:27,767
这是为了带我们越过边境。
That's to take us across the border.

587
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:29,726
我们三个人。
The three of us.

588
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:32,859
去加拿大，我们又可以成为一家人了。
To Canada, we can be a family again.

589
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:35,035
我有一个家庭。
I have a family.

590
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:36,384
你有一个女儿。
You have a daughter.

591
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:37,647
还有一个丈夫。
And a husband.

592
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,736
我们一起建立了自己的生活。
We've built a life together.

593
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:42,390
你对这种生活满意吗？
Are you happy with that life?

594
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:46,177
不总是这样。
Not always.

595
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:48,179
你有没有想过当时是什么样子
Do you ever think back to what it was like

596
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:49,920
当我们住在这里的时候？
when we lived here?

597
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:53,489
-我知道。-我们可以再拥有一次。
- I do. - We can have it all again.

598
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:59,233
我记得你四岁的时候，
I remember when you were four years old,

599
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:01,192
你可以闭上眼睛
you could shut your eyes

600
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:06,589
你从水声中知道你在哪里，
and you knew where you were from the sound of the water,

601
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:09,896
从树木的气味来看，
from the smell of the trees,

602
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:14,205
以及你脚下的土地的感觉。
and the feel of the ground beneath your feet.

603
01:15:14,379 --> 01:15:15,989
就像变魔术一样。
It was like magic.

604
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,125
这就是我们的归宿。
This is where we belong.

605
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:23,170
这是我们的家。
It's our home.

606
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:25,129
我们在这里的生活
Our life here

607
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:27,392
是完美的。
was perfect.

608
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:41,711
不是的！
No!

609
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:47,804
[贝丝]不！
[Beth] No!

610
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,593
你再也不要从我身边跑开了！
Don't you ever run away from me again!

611
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:56,682
好吧?你听到了吗？
Okay? You hear me?

612
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:02,427
我没有...
I wasn't--

613
01:16:10,261 --> 01:16:11,305
完美？
Perfect?

614
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:14,178
对我母亲来说不是。
Not for my mother.

615
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:16,310
嗯，可能是这样的。
Well, it could've been.

616
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:17,616
多么?
How?

617
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:22,273
-你绑架了她.-没有。我们一起私奔了。
- You kidnapped her. - No. We ran away together.

618
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:25,755
这只是她决定离开时说的话。
That's just something she said when she decided to leave.

619
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,453
-你开枪打死了那个人.-我在试着撞引擎.
- You shot that man. - I was trying to hit the engine.

620
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:29,628
你永远不会错过的。
You never would have missed.

621
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,762
我没打中。
I missed.

622
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:36,243
你听过很多关于我的故事。
You've been told a bunch of stories about me.

623
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:40,160
这些都不是真的。我从来都不是沼泽之王，直到他们说我是。
They're not true. I never was the Marsh King, until they said I was.

624
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:44,643
我知道，我们很幸福。
I know this, we were happy.

625
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:46,906
你当时很开心。
You were happy.

626
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:51,432
我要说的是，带上玛丽戈德，让她自己去看看。
All I'm saying, bring Marigold, let her see for herself.

627
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,999
我不能那么做。
I can't do that.

628
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:55,480
我不会的。
I won't.

629
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:58,701
对不起。这就是它结束的地方。
I'm sorry. This is where it ends.

630
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:02,966
我不该来这里的。
I shouldn't have come here.

631
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:07,797
我很高兴我这么做了。
I'm glad I did.

632
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,978
现在我必须回家和家人在一起。
Now I have to go home to my family.

633
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:18,590
请不要再靠近他们了。
Please don't come near them again.

634
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:22,115
-它不需要是这样的。-的确如此。
- It doesn't need to be like this. - It does.

635
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:28,382
好吧。
Okay.

636
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:30,167
好吧。
Okay.

637
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:31,864
我明白。
I understand.

638
01:17:40,177 --> 01:17:41,874
你永远是我的小影子。
You'll always be my Little Shadow.

639
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:47,445
我得走了。
I have to go.

640
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,396
克拉克?
Clark?

641
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:30,140
-你在这里干什么？-我也想问你同样的问题.
- What are you doing here? - Could ask you the same thing.

642
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:32,620
斯蒂芬给我打了电话。他很担心。
Stephen called me. He was worried.

643
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:35,406
我对你说的话有一种预感。
And I just had a hunch after what you said.

644
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:40,411
-他在吗？-我们回去吧我会在路上告诉你的。
- Is he here? - Let's go back. I'll tell you on the way.

645
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:43,153
海伦娜，他来过吗？
Helena, was he here?

646
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:46,025
但他已经走了。
But he's gone.

647
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:02,955
克拉克。克拉克。
Clark. Clark.

648
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:05,828
克拉克。哦，上帝。哦，上帝。
Clark. Oh, God. Oh, God.

649
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,702
克拉克，看着我，好吗？
Clark, look at me, okay?

650
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:12,748
克拉克。克拉克，留下来陪我。
Clark. Clark, stay with me.

651
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:16,055
你告诉他了-你要来这里？-没有，我什么都没说。
You told him - you were coming here? - No, I didn't say anything.

652
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,665
拜托，看着我。
Please, look at me.

653
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,755
克拉克，我就在这里。
Clark, I'm right here.

654
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:23,410
克拉克，等一下。克拉克，请等一下。
Clark, hold on. Please, Clark, hold on.

655
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:25,499
你一定说了什么。
You must've said something.

656
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:27,501
让你的继父感到好奇。
Make your stepfather curious.

657
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:30,591
足以让他一个人一路游荡到这里。
Enough to wander out here all this way by himself.

658
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,985
离我们远点。你做了什么？
Just get away from us. What have you done?

659
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:37,033
拜托，克拉克。请。赶快。
Please, Clark. Please. Come on.

660
01:19:37,642 --> 01:19:39,078
赶快。请。
Come on. Please.

661
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:41,559
嗯，你现在帮不了他了。
Well, there's nothing you can do to help him now.

662
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,044
不是的！
No!

663
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:50,307
你宁愿狼活着也不愿我们活着？
You'd rather the wolf lived than us?

664
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,833
你想让它把你喂给它的小狗？
You want it to feed you to its pup?

665
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:58,141
现在我得自己去找玛丽戈德了。
Now I have to get Marigold on my own.

666
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:00,665
不是的！别碰她！
No! Don't you touch her!

667
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,025
我们仍然可以成为一家人。
We can still all be a family.

668
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:14,722
这就是我想要的。
It's all I want.

669
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:17,508
我很快就会回来和玛丽戈德在一起。
I'll be back with Marigold soon.

670
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:19,336
不是的！不，不。
No! No, no.

671
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:22,469
不是的！
No!

672
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:24,558
不是的！
No!

673
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,862
海伦娜。
Helena.

674
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,874
把绳子缠在你身上。
Wrap the rope around you.

675
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:22,747
他说我可以上来了吗？
Did he say I could come up?

676
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:25,228
我不在乎，我会把你弄出来的。
I don't care, I'm getting you out of there.

677
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:34,585
我抓住你了，我的海伦娜。
I've got you, my Helena.

678
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,718
你不会有事的。
You're gonna be fine.

679
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:41,287
因为你比我强壮。
Because you're stronger than me.

680
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,029
比我更勇敢。
Braver than me.

681
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:27,045
请。
Please.

682
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:31,441
克拉克。
Clark.

683
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:44,845
我太抱歉了。
I'm so sorry.

684
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,601
我会回来找你的。
I'll come back for you.

685
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:07,667
所有的河流都会弯曲，海伦娜。
All rivers bend, Helena.

686
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:46,086
血是热的还是冷的？
Is the blood warm or cold?

687
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,350
冷的。冷的。
Cold. Cold.

688
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:51,048
那么你必须走得更快。
Then you must move faster.

689
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:35,353
跑步还是走路？
Running or walking?

690
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:41,359
跑步。
Running.

691
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,320
如果你害怕，
And if you were afraid,

692
01:28:45,494 --> 01:28:47,147
为你的生命奔跑，
running for your life,

693
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,324
你会跑到哪里去？
where would you run?

694
01:28:54,633 --> 01:28:56,548
到了没人能看到我的地方。
To where no one could see me.

695
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:12,085
你知道你教会了我什么吗。
You know what you taught me.

696
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:11,901
你很好，只是个皮肉伤。
You're fine, it's just a flesh wound.

697
01:31:12,554 --> 01:31:13,555
现在..。
Now...

698
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,296
这对玛丽戈尔德有什么好处？
what good will it do Marigold

699
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:20,213
如果她的母亲躺在沼泽的底部腐烂？
if her mother is lying rotting in the bottom of the marsh?

700
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:22,259
她需要你。
She needs you.

701
01:31:23,913 --> 01:31:26,263
想想什么对你女儿最好。
Just think about what's best for your daughter.

702
01:31:26,437 --> 01:31:27,482
好吧?
Okay?

703
01:31:28,178 --> 01:31:29,788
不是的！
No!

704
01:31:31,311 --> 01:31:32,661
不是的！
No!

705
01:31:34,227 --> 01:31:37,448
你进来的那艘船。让我看看。
The boat you came in. Show me.

706
01:32:22,449 --> 01:32:23,494
继续。
Go on.

707
01:32:25,757 --> 01:32:27,933
我等了一辈子就想再见到你。
I waited my whole life to see you again.

708
01:32:30,066 --> 01:32:32,721
我不确定当我这么做的时候我会有什么感觉。
I wasn't sure what I would feel when I did.

709
01:32:32,895 --> 01:32:35,201
-你有什么感觉，小影子？-别那么叫我.
- What do you feel, Little Shadow? - Don't call me that.

710
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:36,376
现在不是了。
Not anymore.

711
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,424
我以前以为你这么说是因为我一直在你身边。
I used to think you said it because I was always beside you.

712
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:44,036
现在我意识到你的意思是，
Now I realize you just meant,

713
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,474
就像任何影子一样，如果没有你，我就不会存在。
like any shadow, I wouldn't exist if you weren't standing there.

714
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:50,390
我走后，你母亲对你做了一件事。
Your mother did a job on you after I was gone.

715
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,044
不，她没有。
No, she didn't.

716
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:54,873
我这辈子都没怎么跟她说过话。
I barely spoke to her my whole life.

717
01:32:56,179 --> 01:32:59,008
我也把一切都怪到她头上。我从来不相信她。
I blamed her for everything too. I never believed her.

718
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:03,795
你真的觉得她关心你就像我关心你一样？
You really think she cared about you the way I care about you?

719
01:33:03,969 --> 01:33:06,102
她不会拿枪指着我。
She wouldn't have a gun on me.

720
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:10,280
她本可以逃跑的。
She could have run.

721
01:33:11,455 --> 01:33:12,717
逃走了。
Gotten away.

722
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,677
她留下来是为了保护我。
She stayed to protect me.

723
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,811
现在我知道了，她才是坚强的那个。
Now I know, she was the strong one.

724
01:33:19,985 --> 01:33:21,508
她很虚弱。
She was weak.

725
01:33:21,683 --> 01:33:22,771
不是的。
No.

726
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:28,167
一个把女人拖进荒野的男人是软弱的。
A man who drags a woman into the wilderness is weak.

727
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:30,996
小心点，小影子。
Careful, Little Shadow.

728
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:38,351

You forget all the things that I did for you.

729
01:33:39,222 --> 01:33:42,225
我在笼子里度过的岁月
The years I spent in a cage

730
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,141
因为我是为你回来的
'cause I came back for you.

731
01:33:46,098 --> 01:33:48,448
你会为玛丽戈德做什么？
What would you do for Marigold?

732
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,028
我愿意为她而死。
I'd die for her.

733
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:34,843
爸爸！
Daddy!

734
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:43,068
赶快。赶快。
Come on. Come on.

735
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:32,335
睡莲散落在池面上
"Water lilies spread over the surface of the pool

736
01:35:32,509 --> 01:35:35,207
就像一块有花朵图案的地毯。
like a carpet patterned with flowers.

737
01:35:35,381 --> 01:35:40,082
在这块地毯上躺着一位强壮美丽的女人。
And on this carpet lay a strong and beautiful woman.

738
01:35:40,256 --> 01:35:46,566
母亲叫道：“我看到的就是你眼中的我吗？”
The mother cried, '‘Is this myself I see, reflected in your eyes?'

739
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,220
女儿说……“
And the daughter said..."

740
01:35:49,178 --> 01:35:50,570
“我看到的是我吗？”
"Is it me I see,

741
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:53,617
反映在你的身上吗？“
mirrored in yours?"

742
01:35:53,878 --> 01:35:57,186
然后，孩子像一只强大的天鹅一样站了起来
"Then the child rose in the shape of a mighty swan

743
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,579
展开她有力的翅膀。“
and spread her powerful wings."

744
01:36:58,421 --> 01:36:59,901
我不恨你。
I don't hate you.

745
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:03,165
我并不同情你。
I don't pity you.

746
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:05,384
我只记得你的功课。
I just remember your lesson.

747
01:37:07,386 --> 01:37:09,171
永远保护我的家人。
Always protect my family.
