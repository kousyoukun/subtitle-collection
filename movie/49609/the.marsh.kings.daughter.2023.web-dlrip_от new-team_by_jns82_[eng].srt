1
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:53,048
<i>And the mother cried,</i>

2
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:56,747
<i>"Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?"</i>

3
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,533
<i>And the daughter said,</i>

4
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:02,840
<i>"Is it me I see,
mirrored in yours?"</i>

5
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,598
Helena.

6
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,383
Come back.

7
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,590
She's going to make you do
twice as many chores
when you get back.

8
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:43,376
I don't mind the trade.

9
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,205
Maybe if we're gone long enough,
she'll forget she's mad.

10
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,338
Okay.

11
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,820
We'll walk slow, Little Shadow.

12
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,337
It was here.

13
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:33,252
Running or walking?

14
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,475
The strides are wider
than before.

15
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:42,739
And deeper on the outsides.

16
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:49,355
It was running.

17
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:50,834
Why?

18
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:54,925
Because it was scared
of something.

19
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,405
Scared of what?

20
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:00,583
Us.

21
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:05,022
If you were afraid,

22
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,809
running for your life,
where would you go?

23
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,832
Where no one could see me.

24
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,438
It's time you finished the hunt.

25
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,189
What if I miss?

26
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,670
Then we go hungry tonight.

27
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:44,774
I didn't make a sound.

28
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,909
So, what do you think happened?

29
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,180
It smelled me.

30
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:08,929
You won't need the fire.

31
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,985
Helena,
come get what you earned today.

32
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,908
She's always mad at me.

33
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:35,346
Oh, your mother
can't see happiness like we do.

34
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:47,636
Okay.

35
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,985
I'm fine.

36
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,074
It's getting late.

37
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,705
Helena, no more.

38
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:58,838
Where's the rest of it?

39
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,274
It's free now.

40
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,974
It chewed its own leg off?

41
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,716
Sacrificed what it had to,
to survive.

42
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,205
When can I keep mine
in the house like you do?

43
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,860
When you're as good a hunter
as I am.

44
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,253
Which will be never.

45
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:12,781
What do the marks say?

46
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,217
They say,

47
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,219
"When you're running
from an angry moose,

48
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:19,788
beware of low branches."

49
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:28,204
I heard it crying.

50
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,773
She's starving.

51
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:35,255
Well, we have some
scraps inside. We could maybe--

52
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,213
What happens
when those are gone?

53
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:43,350
There's nothing more pure
than the instinct to survive.

54
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,180
The wolf holds no pity.

55
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:51,880
Just the desire
to live another day.

56
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:55,666
What would you do to the wolf,
if you were starving?

57
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,932
You're its prey.

58
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:02,761
We all are.

59
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:11,726
But what about the baby?

60
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,859
Will suffer and die alone.

61
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,556
Now, do what I say, Helena.

62
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,170
- But if--
- Helena, move.

63
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,354
You must always
protect your family.

64
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,129
Nah.
This is one of my alone trips.

65
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:09,436
- But I can help.
- No, come on.
You know the rules.

66
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,960
- I'll bring you back a surprise.
- What kind of surprise?

67
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:15,790
Kind of surprise
you're gonna have to
wait to find out what it is.

68
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,010
Now, get on back there.

69
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:19,272
I'll be home soon.

70
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:43,443
Sorry to come ridin' in on you.

71
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:48,796
Is your mom or dad around?

72
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,107
Hey.

73
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,283
Hope I'm not trespassing
or anything.

74
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,938
Didn't know
anybody lived way out here.

75
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,812
Been out for hours,
and I got all spun around. I--

76
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,857
I can't find my way back
to the trail.

77
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,558
No signal out here anywhere.

78
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:14,822
Look, if you could just
point me toward--

79
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,345
Help!

80
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,173
Please. Before he gets back.

81
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,088
What?

82
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,744
What are we doing?

83
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,311
What are-- What are you doing?

84
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,877
Get on, Helena.[motorist] Whoa. Hang on.

85
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,531
- He'll be back soon.
- Who?

86
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,620
- Please, we have to go. Now!
- I--

87
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,448
- I don't wanna go!
- I can't just take you.

88
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:34,059
I'm not even sure where we are.
That's why I'm--

89
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:42,850
No!

90
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:52,686
Mother! Mother, stop!

91
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,994
Mother! Mother, stop! Stop!

92
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,692
-  Helena!
- No!

93
00:16:58,866 --> 00:16:59,823
Father!

94
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:04,567
Father!

95
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:06,482
Helena?

96
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,006
-  Father!
-  Helena?

97
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:10,704
No!

98
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,013
Stop! Stop!

99
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:29,201
Somebody!

100
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,595
Somebody!

101
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,179
Look who's awake.

102
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:36,485
It's okay, Helena.

103
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,706
Your mother's
just in the next room.

104
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,664
Where's my father?

105
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:45,277
He's not here. You're safe now.

106
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,322
There's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

107
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:50,804
Don't worry about that.

108
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:05,775
Helena.

109
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:10,215
We shouldn't be here.
I want to go home.

110
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,740
- That wasn't our home.
- What did you do?

111
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:17,918
What did you do?

112
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:20,703
- I want Father.
He can't be near us.

113
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,053
Ever again.

114
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,840
He took me, Helena.

115
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,103
Jacob...

116
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,454
kidnapped me
and took me to the woods.

117
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:34,064
You're lying.

118
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,416
You're a liar.
You have always been a liar.

119
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,808
Father told me.

120
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,856
Stop crying!

121
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,858
You're not allowed to do that.

122
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,686
We need to let your mother rest.

123
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:48,644
Just for a few minutes.

124
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,821
We'll be okay. Helena?

125
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,320
Father?

126
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,164
-  Who's out?
-  Yeah.

127
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:48,373
Okay, we have to go. Come on.

128
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,510
You did good. Come on.

129
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:00,036
Okay, let's go this way.

130
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,126
-  There he is!
-  Police! Don't move!

131
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:04,563
Are we gonna go home?

132
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:05,825
One day we will.

133
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,653
Hey! Don't move!

134
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:12,484
Back away from the girl.

135
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,573
No!
On your stomach!

136
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,096
Now!

137
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,750
He didn't do anything wrong.

138
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:19,752
Let me see your hands.

139
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,842
I'll come find you,
Little Shadow.

140
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,105
He's running! I got him!

141
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,107
Hands behind your back!
- Daddy!

142
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:33,608
Shoot.

143
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,088
No running, Marigold.

144
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:23,397
Hi, sweetie.

145
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:27,270
Mrs. Haver said
she has a life of her own,
and if you're gonna be late,

146
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,925
she's gonna
start charging you rent for me.

147
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:32,493
She did, huh?[Marigold] What does that mean?

148
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,844
It means you are so valuable,
she thinks I should pay for you.

149
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,672
Whatcha got here?

150
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,979
My science project.
It's a habitat.[Helena] Uh-huh.

151
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:42,764
Habitat? Who's the habitat for?

152
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:44,984
A baby deer.

153
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:49,423
It sleeps over here,
beside the rocks,
to keep it safe from hunters.

154
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:50,990
Smart deer.

155
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,036
Mommy!

156
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:57,257
What kind of leaf is this?

157
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,433
A walnut.

158
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,914
- From which tree?
- You tell me.

159
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:03,959
There.

160
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,178
Mm-hmm.

161
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:07,310
And what's that tree?

162
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,660
A red oak.

163
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,662
It doesn't look red to me.

164
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:12,359
It will be in the fall.

165
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,795
Do you see the bird?

166
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,103
A wood thrush.

167
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:19,714
How do you know all the names?

168
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:22,325
I can teach you if you want.

169
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,284
I can see a bunny rabbit.

170
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,286
Where?

171
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,290
You have to kind of
tilt your head. See the ears?

172
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:32,988
Oh, yeah. I see it.
With the tail down this way?

173
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:34,207
Yeah.

174
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:40,169
It means that we're one.

175
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:43,564
Family.

176
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:45,827
Mom?

177
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:49,570
When can I have one of these?

178
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,354
Not until you're 82 years old.

179
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,095
That's the rule, remember?

180
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,662
That's not fair.

181
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,838
You got them
when you were young.

182
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:59,841
I was much older than you,
and I wish I hadn't.

183
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,235
I like them.

184
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:03,410
I like you.

185
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:19,208
Daddy's home!

186
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:23,343
Put your stuff inside, sweetie.

187
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,563
We're going to the campus
for Daddy's work picnic.

188
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:27,086
-  Picnic?
- Sorry we're late.

189
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,391
I forgot about
your thing tonight.

190
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,742
That's all right. Let's just go.

191
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,483
I have to change. Why don't you
go on over with her,
and I'll come later.

192
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,398
Well, we've tried that.
You never show.

193
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:37,618
I'm just not good
- at those things.
- Neither am I.

194
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,707
Which is why you're coming with.

195
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,057
Plus, you're my beautiful wife,
and I want to show you off.

196
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:50,936
You know, it's funny.

197
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:52,938
Thank you.

198
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,853
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

199
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,681
Is Marigold having fun?

200
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:58,291
I don't know.
The crazy thing is,

201
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,162
my students don't even try
to hide it anymore.

202
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:02,164
Phones are going off
my entire lecture.

203
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,906
Well, in their defense,
I have heard
some of your lectures.

204
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:11,130
I love that. It's unusual.

205
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:14,176
- Oh, thanks.
Did you get it around here?

206
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,570
Uh, in San Francisco,
when I was a teenager.

207
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:19,617
You have a bunch of them.

208
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,270
Too many.

209
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:23,882
I didn't know
you're from San Francisco.

210
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:27,320
Other places too.
- We moved around a lot.
- What'd your parents do?

211
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:30,236
My father worked in insurance,
my mom sometimes did telemarketing.

212
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,804
Doesn't get much more boring
than that.

213
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:39,375
"Then she took 20 mattresses
and laid them on the pea.

214
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,944
On this, the princess
had to lie all night.

215
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:45,817
In the morning
she was asked how she had slept.

216
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,427
And the princess said...

217
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:54,695
'‘Oh, very badly.'"

218
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,070
What's going on?
Where's my daughter?

219
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:33,071
Helena Erikkson?

220
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:34,855
Where's Marigold?

221
00:30:35,073 --> 00:30:36,422
She's not here.
This isn't about her.

222
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:38,511
I'm Special Agent Illing.

223
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:40,513
What are you doing in my house?

224
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,994
- Ms. Erikkson.
- My name is Pelletier.

225
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:45,779
Before that,
it was Jones, correct?

226
00:30:45,953 --> 00:30:48,608
Then Mitchell,
after you changed it
from Bekkum.

227
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:52,046
But you were born
to Jacob Holbrook
and Beth Erikkson.

228
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,396
What do you want?

229
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,095
Your father, Jacob Holbrook.

230
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,271
He and another prisoner
escaped last night

231
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:02,535
while being transported
across the state line
to Alger Penitentiary.

232
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:05,059
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

233
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,106
When I was ten years old.

234
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,412
- Has he tried
to contact you recently?
- No.

235
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:12,197
Are you sure? Not even once?

236
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,460
You could've called me.
You didn't need to come here.

237
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:15,809
What's going on?

238
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:18,812
You okay?

239
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:20,509
Do you know where your father
might be going?

240
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,555
Y-Your father?

241
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:24,818
You can't just
come into my house.

242
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,994
Our warrant allows us
to check for any
possible communication

243
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,735
to or from your father.

244
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,780
Why do you keep saying that?
Helena's father--

245
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,608
He doesn't know where I live,
doesn't know my last name,

246
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:34,872
doesn't know anything about me.

247
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,091
And that's same
for your family
and friends? Have any of your--

248
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:39,659
I've never told anyone
Jacob Holbrook is my father.

249
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:44,446
So, 20 years.

250
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,059
No letter,
birthday card, anything?

251
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,060
No.

252
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,757
I'm confused.

253
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:52,411
I thought your parents died
in a car accident.

254
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,935
That's what I told you.

255
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,155
And Holbrook,
that's the Marsh King guy.
The one that just escaped.

256
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,852
I heard it on the radio.

257
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:01,507
That's right.

258
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:03,161
Is there any risk
of him coming here?

259
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:04,597
That's what we're trying
to find out.

260
00:32:04,771 --> 00:32:06,599
He doesn't know where I live.

261
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:09,210
Oh,
you can't be too sure of that.

262
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,299
Christ, Helena.
How could you not have told me?

263
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,041
I told you to stay in the car, sweetie.

264
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:16,914
- Who are these people?
- Police. They're just--

265
00:32:17,088 --> 00:32:18,698
I'm gonna take her.
I'll call you later.

266
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:24,965
We're gonna need to see
your phone
and any computers you use.

267
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:27,098
With any luck,
your father will be found soon.

268
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:30,057
You don't know my father.

269
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:34,279
If he makes it to the wild,
you'll never see him again.

270
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,890
<i>In a case that received
nationwide notoriety,</i>

271
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:40,154
<i>Jacob Holbrook,
the so-called "Marsh King,"
abducted Beth Erikkson</i>

272
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:42,243
<i>and held her for 12 years</i>

273
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:43,549
<i>in the wilderness
of Michigan's Upper Peninsula,</i>

274
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:45,768
<i>until she eventually escaped</i>

275
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:48,293
<i>with the daughter
she gave birth to
while in captivity.</i>

276
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,948
<i>After the trial,
Erikkson had difficulty
adapting to normal life</i>

277
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:53,211
<i>and was rarely seen in public.</i>

278
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,865
<i>Tragically,
she died four years ago
in an apparent suicide.</i>

279
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:23,284
<i>Yeah?</i>

280
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,808
You guys coming home?

281
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:28,898
<i>I grabbed a hotel room
for the night.
Mari's in the pool.</i>

282
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,946
I could bring her over
some school clothes,
if you want.

283
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,731
<i>I'm keeping her out tomorrow,
just in case.</i>

284
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:38,604
I didn't think
this would happen.

285
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:39,953
<i>That I'd find out?</i>

286
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:42,390
No. I mean, I wish I--

287
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,001
<i>Mari's yelling for me.
I gotta go.</i>

288
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:13,394
<i>Little Shadow.</i>

289
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:15,135
Time to check our snares.

290
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:16,963
And a real hunter...

291
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,098
needs a real knife.

292
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,972
This is yours now.

293
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:29,671
Let's see how you do with it.

294
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,151
Hi.

295
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:29,068
I called earlier,
but you didn't answer.

296
00:38:29,982 --> 00:38:31,636
I'm not great with phones.

297
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,073
That's an understatement.

298
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:36,771
I saw the news.

299
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:39,296
Thought I'd shoot down
and say hello.

300
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:41,907
Hello, Clark.

301
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:45,258
Maybe grab a glass of water
before I head back.

302
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:02,101
I know you
don't want me dropping in,

303
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,495
but I figured
everything's changed a bit now.

304
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:07,411
Cat's outta the bag.

305
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:09,064
How's your husband taking it?

306
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:10,631
Not well.

307
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:13,199
He'll come around.
Just a matter of time.

308
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,724
The little one's
not so little anymore.

309
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,685
Your mother
would've loved to have met her.

310
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:25,037
I thought you might bring
Marigold up home a while back,

311
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,256
at least for the funeral.

312
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,215
She wouldn't have
met her then either.

313
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:32,261
That's true enough.

314
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,525
Then, I guess I meant
I wish you woulda come sooner.

315
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:36,831
She would've liked that.

316
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:43,664
He still has that job
at the college?

317
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,538
You still doing--Nothing's changed.

318
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,236
Okay.

319
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:53,544
This is not how I saw this
playing out.

320
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:58,026
I'm sorry,
I just can't do this right now.

321
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:08,123
Well,
at least it's not in the press.

322
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:12,084
No one's putting you with him.

323
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:14,521
Just wanted to make sure
you weren't worried
about things.

324
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:16,784
I'm not.

325
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,138
You know, there was a space
when you were about 13 or so.

326
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:27,273
I thought we had a shot at bein'
a nice little family,
the three of us.

327
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,624
It was never the three of us, Clark.

328
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:33,714
She didn't want me around.

329
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:35,803
When she looked at me,
she saw my father.

330
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:37,588
So did you.

331
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:39,677
No.

332
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:41,418
You're forgetting
some good days.

333
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:43,985
She loved you.

334
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:46,292
I still love you.

335
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:48,990
I miss you.

336
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,300
But sure, maybe sometimes
we saw a little Jacob in you.

337
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:58,347
Or maybe you never saw
enough of him in me.

338
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,836
You here to relieve this fella?[officer] No, I'm supposed to--

339
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,536
Mrs. Pelletier,
the FBI would like you
to come down to the office.

340
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,972
Did something come up?

341
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:15,321
Way above my pay grade.

342
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,063
You want me to come with you?

343
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,588
We found your father's body.

344
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:25,070
Just inside the state line.

345
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:28,116
We assume they were heading
for a crossing to Canada.

346
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,684
Guard rail,
60 feet up on the embankment
was splintered.

347
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,121
Driver either lost control
or fell asleep.

348
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:35,559
The car hit a tree
and caught fire.

349
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:38,213
Both men were burned
beyond recognition.

350
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:41,173
We think they had an accomplice.
We're looking for him now.

351
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:44,219
How can you be sure
it's Holbrook?

352
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:52,227
He has three gold teeth
with carvings
matching your father.

353
00:41:58,756 --> 00:41:59,757
You all right?

354
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:04,675
My father died 20 years ago.

355
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:40,145
Mmm.

356
00:42:41,538 --> 00:42:43,583
I'm sorry about your daddy.

357
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:46,020
We saw it on TV.

358
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:49,458
Thank you, sweetie,
but he wasn't my daddy
for a long time.

359
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,461
We brought you some food
in case you didn't wanna cook.

360
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:56,074
Let me guess, extra pepperoni?

361
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:59,033
- I'm definitely in the mood
for pizza.
- Yes!

362
00:43:02,776 --> 00:43:03,995
How you doing?

363
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,736
I'm fine.

364
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:12,220
I wish you would've told me
the truth.

365
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:15,702
What's the worst
that could've happened?

366
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:19,967
- We wouldn't have Mari.
- You don't know that.

367
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:22,883
Yes, I do.

368
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:26,626
Who in their right mind
would get involved
with the daughter...

369
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,848
If you knew my name
was Holbrook, you'd never have
gone on a date with me.

370
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:32,719
You would've run the other way.

371
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,548
- You will now.
- Hold on.

372
00:43:37,202 --> 00:43:40,161
Let's pretend
that I'm a better person
than you think I am, all right?

373
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:42,250
What's the best thing
that could've happened?

374
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:45,906
You might've found
somebody to trust.

375
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,345
Someone to help you through
all the shitty days.

376
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,913
Somebody to explain
all your weird tattoos to.

377
00:43:59,616 --> 00:44:01,226
The best never happens, Stephen.

378
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:03,663
No matter how badly we want it.

379
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:27,992
- Marigold okay?
- Yeah.

380
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,254
She's asleep.

381
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,126
Do you really believe that?

382
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:36,348
What you said before about...

383
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:39,830
the best never happening.

384
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,225
Because if you do,
what's that mean for us?

385
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:51,537
Look I--
I don't wanna make
this any worse for you.

386
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:54,105
But you gotta let me in, Helena.

387
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,853
Okay, look.
I'm gonna go do some work
at the office.

388
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,508
Probably sleep over there.

389
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,991
My name is Helena Holbrook.

390
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,735
Remember the guy
who kidnapped that woman?

391
00:45:59,953 --> 00:46:02,173
The one everybody called
The Marsh King?

392
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,219
I'm his daughter.

393
00:46:11,965 --> 00:46:16,578
Sometimes I sneak off alone
at night because I feel trapped.

394
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:20,757
Like I can't figure out
which world I really belong in.

395
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,504
I have trouble trusting people because...

396
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:34,596
everyone tells me
the person I believed
in the most

397
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,816
was really a monster.

398
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:44,519
He gave me this
after my first kill.

399
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,749
And this one when I missed.

400
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:01,928
This is the place
he taught me to swim.

401
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:10,937
The name he gave me.

402
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,551
This to remind me never to wait
to do my chores.

403
00:47:21,948 --> 00:47:24,995
These were the only tears
my father ever wanted to see.

404
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:32,611
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

405
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,512
Come on. I know.[Marigold] I can do it.

406
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:06,906
I have been looking forward
to this day.

407
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,343
Thought it was time
to introduce you
to a couple people.

408
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:11,563
Look, Daddy,
they have horses.

409
00:48:11,824 --> 00:48:15,045
This is Clark.
He's gonna try his best
to get you to call him Grandpa.

410
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:16,742
Make him earn it.

411
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,962
That doesn't scare me a bit.

412
00:48:19,136 --> 00:48:20,789
I've got no one else
to spend it on.

413
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,270
It is very nice to meet you, Marigold.

414
00:48:23,444 --> 00:48:24,663
You too, Clark.

415
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:27,709
I'm gonna like this one.

416
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:29,886
Would you like
to see the horses?

417
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,556
Who's getting hungry?

418
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:43,655
Two hours after I took that,

419
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:46,266
I started getting calls
that some hoodlum

420
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,008
was setting off fireworks
in people's yards.

421
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:52,272
She tore that dress to shreds,
running from one of my deputies.

422
00:49:52,446 --> 00:49:54,318
You can stop now.

423
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,363
Oh, hell, we haven't even got
to your difficult stage yet.

424
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:58,061
Who's that?

425
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:02,326
That's your grandmother.

426
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:05,851
You definitely take after her.

427
00:50:08,245 --> 00:50:10,116
I don't remember that picture.

428
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,031
It looks like us.

429
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:20,300
You know, I wouldn't complain
if this became a habit.

430
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:29,396
Thank you, Clark.

431
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,181
Anytime.

432
00:50:32,182 --> 00:50:33,792
Hey.

433
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:37,143
You know,
Jacob took a lot
of my people's beliefs,

434
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:40,494
twisted 'em
to fit what suited him.

435
00:50:43,932 --> 00:50:46,892
Means "owned" in Ojibwa.
Not "family."

436
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:48,937
Don't confuse the two.

437
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:21,927
Sh--

438
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,222
Little Shadow.

439
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:12,717
What's wrong?

440
00:52:17,461 --> 00:52:19,811
I'm just getting some water.

441
00:54:28,505 --> 00:54:32,291
Hey,
make sure you wipe your feet
when you come in the house.

442
00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:33,510
I did.

443
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:35,947
I'll drop her on the way.

444
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,123
See you after.

445
00:54:38,428 --> 00:54:40,212
- We'll go swimming or something.
- Don't forget my goggles.

446
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:42,562
I got that conference
in Detroit this afternoon.

447
00:54:42,736 --> 00:54:43,737
Might be home late.

448
00:54:45,217 --> 00:54:46,218
- You gonna be okay?
- Mmm.

449
00:54:57,838 --> 00:54:58,839
Thank you.

450
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,411
Helena?

451
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:06,804
How you doing?

452
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:09,415
Good. Fine.

453
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:11,374
Are you guys
around this weekend?

454
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:13,985
I was thinking Jess and Marigold
could have a playdate.

455
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,641
Oh, yeah.
I think we're free, just...

456
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,604
Sorry. Yeah, she'd love that.

457
00:55:24,778 --> 00:55:27,215
How's Saturday?
Would she like
to come over to our place?

458
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,480
Of course.
She has swim until 10:00
but after that...

459
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:44,972
Can you hold on a second? Sorry.

460
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:05,009
You're not helping.

461
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:08,795
I'm not supposed to help.
This is your homework, not mine.

462
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:10,275
But you always help.

463
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:12,277
Well, you can figure this out.

464
00:57:12,451 --> 00:57:15,411
Why are you in a bad mood again?

465
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,021
I'm not.

466
00:57:18,283 --> 00:57:19,545
I don't mean to be.

467
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:23,984
Let's go read. We'll get Daddy
to help us finish
in the morning.

468
00:57:24,158 --> 00:57:25,769
- Okay?
- Okay.

469
00:57:30,077 --> 00:57:32,776
"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool

470
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,735
like a carpet patterned
with flowers.

471
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:39,173
And on this carpet,
lay a young and beautiful woman.

472
00:57:39,347 --> 00:57:44,657
The mother cried,
'‘Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?'

473
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:46,224
And the daughter said..."

474
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:51,751
Hey, daughter?
You missed your entrance.

475
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:29,485
<i>Helena.</i>

476
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:43,977
-  What is it?
- It's a doll.

477
00:58:44,674 --> 00:58:47,546
You-- You play with it.

478
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:49,635
Like a friend.

479
00:58:56,468 --> 00:58:57,469
She has hair like me.

480
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:00,080
A tiny Helena.

481
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:26,036
Oh, God.

482
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:29,561
Marigold!

483
01:00:34,348 --> 01:00:35,262
Helena!

484
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:36,699
Hey, it's me.

485
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,091
It's me.

486
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,400
Jesus. What are you...

487
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:45,446
Uh... I--Whose blood is that?

488
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:48,798
No one's. A rabbit.
I heard somebody outside.

489
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:50,756
Maybe try calling the police

490
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:53,585
instead of running around
in the dark
with a knife.

491
01:00:53,759 --> 01:00:57,545
-  I have to check
on Marigold.
- Marigold's fine. She's asleep.

492
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,851
I just left her room.

493
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:00,810
Did you see anyone out there?

494
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:05,336
Hey.

495
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:07,730
We're gonna keep
the doors locked,
all right?

496
01:01:07,904 --> 01:01:09,427
Get a few cop cars on patrol.

497
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,126
It's gonna be okay.

498
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,593
<i>It was bleeding
from the head.</i>

499
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,901
Like someone killed it first,
then put it in the snare.

500
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,036
Or maybe it got injured
some other way.

501
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:57,475
What's got you spooked?
Why do you think
there's something more?

502
01:01:57,649 --> 01:01:59,999
I feel like he's here.

503
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:02,872
<i>The night you found us,</i>

504
01:02:03,046 --> 01:02:04,700
<i>when we came out of the woods,</i>

505
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:07,311
I was so afraid
because he wasn't there with me.

506
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,357
But then he came.

507
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,142
Don't get lost in this, Helena.

508
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,187
<i>Now he's come back again.</i>

509
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:17,016
<i>I have to tell him
to leave us alone.</i>

510
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:20,019
You have got to try to get him
out of your head.

511
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:21,325
For good.

512
01:02:21,717 --> 01:02:23,675
I'm not sure
I can do that.

513
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:25,416
How could he be alive?

514
01:02:25,982 --> 01:02:27,200
I don't know.

515
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:37,167
<i>There's nothing purer
than the instinct to survive.</i>

516
01:03:00,581 --> 01:03:02,018
Mommy!

517
01:03:07,023 --> 01:03:08,024
Marigold?

518
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,724
I couldn't find my backpack.

519
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,729
Oh, no, no, no. That stays here.

520
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,514
I wanna show people.

521
01:03:20,688 --> 01:03:22,560
Let's wait a while on that, okay?

522
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:23,953
Okay.

523
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:35,486
Where did you get those?

524
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,315
I thought you made them.
I like them.

525
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:40,099
Looks like you and me.

526
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,852
Has the habitat been
in your room
the whole time?

527
01:03:55,027 --> 01:03:56,115
Mm-hmm.

528
01:04:13,785 --> 01:04:15,004
What are you doing?

529
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,884
Come on.

530
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:32,891
<i>Stay inside after school
unless Daddy</i>

531
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:37,113
<i>or I are here, okay?
Don't go with anyone else,
no matter what they say.</i>

532
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,314
What's this about?

533
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:05,881
Just felt like it.

534
01:05:06,185 --> 01:05:08,666
<i>Can you pick Marigold up
after school?</i>

535
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,842
<i>Of course.</i>

536
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:12,496
<i>Why?</i>

537
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:17,153
<i>I have to do something.
I can't tell you what it is.</i>

538
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:25,248
<i>What's going on, Helena?</i>

539
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:30,427
<i>I know I haven't given you
any reason to...</i>

540
01:05:32,124 --> 01:05:33,517
<i>please trust me.</i>

541
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,346
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

542
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:38,783
<i>Back from where?</i>

543
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:41,786
<i>Last secret, Stephen.</i>

544
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:44,049
<i>Promise.</i>

545
01:06:04,678 --> 01:06:06,637
You and Mari rescued me.

546
01:08:11,457 --> 01:08:13,242
<i>I can call it anything I want?</i>

547
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,896
It's yours.
I gave it to you.

548
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:21,119
I name it

549
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:23,643
Helena Falls.

550
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:31,249
Hello, Little Shadow.

551
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:17,730
Let's go for a walk.

552
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:37,794
How did you find me?

553
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:39,752
I never lost you, Little Shadow.

554
01:11:51,764 --> 01:11:53,288
I miss that smell.

555
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:58,031
And the taste.

556
01:12:01,992 --> 01:12:02,993
Gimme that.

557
01:12:15,527 --> 01:12:16,920
My favorite knife.

558
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:41,553
We used to come camping up here,
you remember?

559
01:12:42,728 --> 01:12:45,557
We'd lay out here
all summer long.

560
01:12:45,731 --> 01:12:47,124
Look up at the sky,

561
01:12:47,385 --> 01:12:48,647
see who could count
the most shooting stars.

562
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,563
I used to cheat
and count airplanes.

563
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:59,049
You knew I was alive
the whole time,
didn't you?

564
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:01,704
I didn't know
how it was possible.

565
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:05,229
Not until I saw
a three-legged coyote.

566
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:09,189
Sacrificed its own leg
for freedom.

567
01:13:09,364 --> 01:13:11,540
Like you sacrificed your teeth.

568
01:13:11,714 --> 01:13:13,672
Ah.

569
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:16,066
Probably won't pass
a medical exam,

570
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,155
but it bought you
the time you needed.

571
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:21,376
You did some digging.

572
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:23,726
Well done.

573
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:31,429
You didn't tell anyone else
your theory?

574
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:34,911
Did you?

575
01:13:40,395 --> 01:13:42,222
Wish you'd brought Marigold.

576
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:45,574
Tell me about my granddaughter.

577
01:13:45,748 --> 01:13:49,360
I don't think so.
You know enough
about her already.

578
01:13:53,103 --> 01:13:54,583
Well, I had to take a peek.

579
01:13:57,063 --> 01:13:58,848
You never brought her
to visit me.

580
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:02,417
You didn't visit me at all.

581
01:14:06,986 --> 01:14:08,292
Come on, Little Shadow.

582
01:14:08,466 --> 01:14:09,859
I want to show you something.

583
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:15,865
You know,
Marigold looks like her.

584
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:17,649
Your mother.

585
01:14:18,781 --> 01:14:20,826
I bet she loves the water
as much as we do.

586
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:27,746
That's to take us
across the border.

587
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:29,705
The three of us.

588
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:32,838
To Canada,
we can be a family again.

589
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,014
I have a family.

590
01:14:35,188 --> 01:14:36,363
You have a daughter.

591
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,626
And a husband.

592
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,715
We've built a life together.

593
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,369
Are you happy with that life?

594
01:14:44,807 --> 01:14:46,156
Not always.

595
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,158
Do you ever think
back to what it was like

596
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:49,899
when we lived here?

597
01:14:50,247 --> 01:14:53,468
- I do.
- We can have it all again.

598
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,212
I remember
when you were four years old,

599
01:14:59,386 --> 01:15:01,171
you could shut your eyes

600
01:15:02,738 --> 01:15:06,568
and you knew where you were
from the sound of the water,

601
01:15:06,742 --> 01:15:09,875
from the smell of the trees,

602
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:14,184
and the feel of the ground
beneath your feet.

603
01:15:14,358 --> 01:15:15,968
It was like magic.

604
01:15:19,494 --> 01:15:21,104
This is where we belong.

605
01:15:21,278 --> 01:15:23,149
It's our home.

606
01:15:23,802 --> 01:15:25,108
Our life here

607
01:15:26,196 --> 01:15:27,371
was perfect.

608
01:15:40,558 --> 01:15:41,690
No!

609
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:47,783
[Beth] No!

610
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:54,572
Don't you ever run away
from me again!

611
01:15:55,225 --> 01:15:56,661
Okay? You hear me?

612
01:16:01,231 --> 01:16:02,406
I wasn't--

613
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,284
Perfect?

614
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:14,157
Not for my mother.

615
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,289
Well, it could've been.

616
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:17,595
How?

617
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:22,252
- You kidnapped her.
- No. We ran away together.

618
01:16:22,426 --> 01:16:25,734
That's just something she said
when she decided to leave.

619
01:16:25,908 --> 01:16:28,432
- You shot that man.
- I was trying to hit the engine.

620
01:16:28,606 --> 01:16:29,607
You never would have missed.

621
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,741
I missed.

622
01:16:32,915 --> 01:16:36,222
You've been told a bunch
of stories about me.

623
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:40,139
They're not true.
I never was the Marsh King,
until they said I was.

624
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:44,622
I know this, we were happy.

625
01:16:45,623 --> 01:16:46,885
You were happy.

626
01:16:48,844 --> 01:16:51,411
All I'm saying, bring Marigold,
let her see for herself.

627
01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:52,978
I can't do that.

628
01:16:54,153 --> 01:16:55,459
I won't.

629
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,680
I'm sorry.
This is where it ends.

630
01:17:01,073 --> 01:17:02,945
I shouldn't have come here.

631
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:07,776
I'm glad I did.

632
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:14,957
Now I have to go home
to my family.

633
01:17:15,827 --> 01:17:18,569
Please don't come
near them again.

634
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,094
- It doesn't need to be
like this.
- It does.

635
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,361
Okay.

636
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:30,146
Okay.

637
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,843
I understand.

638
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,853
You'll always be
my Little Shadow.

639
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:47,424
I have to go.

640
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,375
Clark?

641
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:30,119
- What are you doing here?
- Could ask you the same thing.

642
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:32,599
Stephen called me.
He was worried.

643
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,385
And I just had a hunch
after what you said.

644
01:18:37,082 --> 01:18:40,390
- Is he here?
- Let's go back.
I'll tell you on the way.

645
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:43,132
Helena, was he here?

646
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:46,004
But he's gone.

647
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,934
Clark. Clark.

648
01:19:03,108 --> 01:19:05,807
Clark. Oh, God. Oh, God.

649
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,681
Clark, look at me, okay?

650
01:19:10,855 --> 01:19:12,727
Clark. Clark, stay with me.

651
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:16,034
You told him
- you were coming here?
- No, I didn't say anything.

652
01:19:16,469 --> 01:19:17,644
Please, look at me.

653
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,734
Clark, I'm right here.

654
01:19:21,431 --> 01:19:23,389
Clark, hold on.
Please, Clark, hold on.

655
01:19:23,563 --> 01:19:25,478
You must've said something.

656
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:27,480
Make your stepfather curious.

657
01:19:27,654 --> 01:19:30,570
Enough to wander out here
all this way by himself.

658
01:19:30,745 --> 01:19:32,964
Just get away from us.
What have you done?

659
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,012
Please, Clark. Please. Come on.

660
01:19:37,621 --> 01:19:39,057
Come on. Please.

661
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,538
Well, there's nothing you can do
to help him now.

662
01:19:46,673 --> 01:19:48,023
No!

663
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:50,286
You'd rather the wolf lived
than us?

664
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:54,812
You want it to feed you
to its pup?

665
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:58,120
Now I have to get Marigold
on my own.

666
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,644
No! Don't you touch her!

667
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,004
We can still all be a family.

668
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:14,701
It's all I want.

669
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,487
I'll be back with Marigold soon.

670
01:20:17,661 --> 01:20:19,315
No! No, no.

671
01:20:21,404 --> 01:20:22,448
No!

672
01:20:23,493 --> 01:20:24,537
No!

673
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:06,841
Helena.

674
01:21:17,329 --> 01:21:18,853
Wrap the rope around you.

675
01:21:21,203 --> 01:21:22,726
Did he say I could come up?

676
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,207
I don't care,
I'm getting you out of there.

677
01:21:32,692 --> 01:21:34,564
I've got you, my Helena.

678
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,697
You're gonna be fine.

679
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:41,266
Because you're stronger than me.

680
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,008
Braver than me.

681
01:23:25,762 --> 01:23:27,024
Please.

682
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:31,420
Clark.

683
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:44,824
I'm so sorry.

684
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:01,580
I'll come back for you.

685
01:25:05,427 --> 01:25:07,646
<i>All rivers bend, Helena.</i>

686
01:27:44,063 --> 01:27:46,065
<i>Is the blood warm
or cold?</i>

687
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:48,329
Cold.
<i>Cold.</i>

688
01:27:48,677 --> 01:27:51,027
<i>Then you must move faster.</i>

689
01:28:33,678 --> 01:28:35,332
<i>Running or walking?</i>

690
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:41,338
<i>Running.</i>

691
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:45,299
<i>And if you were afraid,</i>

692
01:28:45,473 --> 01:28:47,126
<i>running for your life,</i>

693
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:49,303
<i>where would you run?</i>

694
01:28:54,612 --> 01:28:56,527
<i>To where no one could see me.</i>

695
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:12,064
You know what you taught me.

696
01:31:09,268 --> 01:31:11,880
You're fine,
it's just a flesh wound.

697
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:13,534
Now...

698
01:31:14,448 --> 01:31:16,275
what good will it do Marigold

699
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:20,192
if her mother is lying rotting
in the bottom of the marsh?

700
01:31:20,845 --> 01:31:22,238
She needs you.

701
01:31:23,892 --> 01:31:26,242
Just think about
what's best for your daughter.

702
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:27,461
Okay?

703
01:31:28,157 --> 01:31:29,767
No!

704
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:32,640
No!

705
01:31:34,206 --> 01:31:37,427
The boat you came in. Show me.

706
01:32:22,428 --> 01:32:23,473
Go on.

707
01:32:25,736 --> 01:32:27,912
I waited my whole life
to see you again.

708
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,700
I wasn't sure what I would feel
when I did.

709
01:32:32,874 --> 01:32:35,180
- What do you feel,
Little Shadow?
- Don't call me that.

710
01:32:35,354 --> 01:32:36,355
Not anymore.

711
01:32:38,009 --> 01:32:40,403
I used to think you said it
because I was always beside you.

712
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,015
Now I realize you just meant,

713
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:47,453
like any shadow,
I wouldn't exist
if you weren't standing there.

714
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:50,369
Your mother did a job on you
after I was gone.

715
01:32:50,544 --> 01:32:52,023
No, she didn't.

716
01:32:53,024 --> 01:32:54,852
I barely spoke
to her my whole life.

717
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:58,987
I blamed her for everything too.
I never believed her.

718
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:03,774
You really think she cared
about you
the way I care about you?

719
01:33:03,948 --> 01:33:06,081
She wouldn't have a gun on me.

720
01:33:08,823 --> 01:33:10,259
She could have run.

721
01:33:11,434 --> 01:33:12,696
Gotten away.

722
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,656
She stayed to protect me.

723
01:33:17,396 --> 01:33:19,790
Now I know,
she was the strong one.

724
01:33:19,964 --> 01:33:21,487
She was weak.

725
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:22,750
No.

726
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:28,146
A man who drags a woman
into the wilderness is weak.

727
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,975
Careful, Little Shadow.

728
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:38,330
You forget all the things
that I did for you.

729
01:33:39,201 --> 01:33:42,204
The years I spent in a cage

730
01:33:42,378 --> 01:33:45,120
'cause I came back for you.

731
01:33:46,077 --> 01:33:48,427
What would you do for Marigold?

732
01:34:01,658 --> 01:34:03,007
I'd die for her.

733
01:34:33,385 --> 01:34:34,822
Daddy!

734
01:34:41,089 --> 01:34:43,047
Come on. Come on.

735
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:32,314
<i>"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool</i>

736
01:35:32,488 --> 01:35:35,186
<i>like a carpet patterned
with flowers.</i>

737
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:40,061
<i>And on this carpet lay
a strong and beautiful woman.</i>

738
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:46,545
The mother cried,
'‘Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?'

739
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,199
And the daughter said..."

740
01:35:49,157 --> 01:35:50,549
"Is it me I see,

741
01:35:51,986 --> 01:35:53,596
mirrored in yours?"

742
01:35:53,857 --> 01:35:57,165
"Then the child rose
in the shape of a mighty swan

743
01:35:57,339 --> 01:35:59,558
and spread her powerful wings."

744
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,880
I don't hate you.

745
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,144
I don't pity you.

746
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,363
I just remember your lesson.

747
01:37:07,365 --> 01:37:09,150
Always protect my family.
