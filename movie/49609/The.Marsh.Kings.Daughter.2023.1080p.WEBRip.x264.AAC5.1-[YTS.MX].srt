[person] <i>And the mother cried,</i>

00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:56,653
<i>"Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?"</i>

5
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>And the daughter said,</i>

6
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:02,724
[daughter]
<i>"Is it me I see,
mirrored in yours?"</i>

7
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,772
[insects buzzing]

00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,710
[birds chirping]

9
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:04,555
[person] Helena.

10
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,393
Come back.

11
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:40,388
She's going to make you do
twice as many chores
when you get back.

12
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:43,124
I don't mind the trade.

13
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,267
Maybe if we're gone long enough,
she'll forget she's mad.

14
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,369
Okay.

15
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,735
We'll walk slow, Little Shadow.

16
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:12,425
[birds chirping]

17
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,138
It was here.

18
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,072
Running or walking?

19
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:39,250
[Helena] The strides are wider
than before.

20
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:42,686
And deeper on the outsides.

21
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,156
It was running.

22
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,760
Why?

23
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,834
Because it was scared
of something.

24
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,436
Scared of what?

25
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:00,572
Us.

26
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:04,907
If you were afraid,

27
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,745
running for your life,
where would you go?

28
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,768
[Helena]
Where no one could see me.

29
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,479
[whispering]
It's time you finished the hunt.

30
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,816
[whispering] What if I miss?

31
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,659
Then we go hungry tonight.

32
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,001

[sighs]

35
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,742
I didn't make a sound.

36
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,845
So, what do you think happened?

37
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,053
It smelled me.

38
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,865
You won't need the fire.

39
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,911
Helena,
come get what you earned today.

40
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,450
[Helena] She's always mad at me.

41
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,188
[parent] Oh, your mother
can't see happiness like we do.

42
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:18,869
- [insects buzzing]
- [birds chirping]

43

[mother panting]

45
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,497
[parent] Okay.

46
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,932
[mother] I'm fine.

47
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,000
It's getting late.

00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,074
[bird whistle tootling]

49
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,725
Helena, no more.

50
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,666
Where's the rest of it?

51
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,172
It's free now.

52
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:02,341
[flies buzzing]

53
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,710
It chewed its own leg off?

54
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:07,747
Sacrificed what it had to,
to survive.

55
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,178
[echoed gunshot]

56
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:12,983

[metal rattling]

61
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,965
When can I keep mine
in the house like you do?

62
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,633
When you're as good a hunter
as I am.

63
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:05,934
Which will be never.

64
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:08,203
- [parent growling]
- [Helena yelps]

65
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:10,040
[Helena grunts]

66
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:12,574
What do the marks say?

67
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,976
They say,

68
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,145
"When you're running
from an angry moose,

69
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:19,586
beware of low branches."

00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,715

[growling]

74
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,151
I heard it crying.

75
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,353
[parent] She's starving.

76
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:34,958
Well, we have some
scraps inside. We could maybe--

77
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:37,160
What happens
when those are gone?

78
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:43,265
There's nothing more pure
than the instinct to survive.

79
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,139
The wolf holds no pity.

80
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,440
Just the desire
to live another day.

81
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:55,508
What would you do to the wolf,
if you were starving?

82
00:12:58,717 --> 00:12:59,952
You're its prey.

83
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,823
We all are.

84
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,356
[pup whines]

85
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,563
But what about the baby?

86
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,665
Will suffer and die alone.

87
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,429
Now, do what I say, Helena.

88
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,138
- But if--
- Helena, move.

89
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,976
[wolf yelps]

90
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,280
You must always
protect your family.

[indistinct arguing in distance]

92
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,647
Nah.
This is one of my alone trips.

93
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,188
- But I can help.
- No, come on.
You know the rules.

94
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,589
I'll bring you back a surprise.
What kind of surprise?

95
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,621
Kind of surprise
you're gonna have to
wait to find out what it is.

96
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,860
Now, get on back there.

97
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,229
I'll be home soon.

98
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,464

[motor whirring]

102
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:43,379
Sorry to come ridin' in on you.

103
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:48,648
Is your mom or dad around?

104
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,719
Hey.

105
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:57,022
Hope I'm not trespassing
or anything.

106
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:59,758
Didn't know
anybody lived way out here.

107
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,498
Been out for hours,
and I got all spun around. I--

108
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:06,704
I can't find my way back
to the trail.

109
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,239
[breathing shakily]

110
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,473
No signal out here anywhere.

111
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,677
Look, if you could just
point me toward--

112
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,078
Help!

113
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,183
Please. Before he gets back.

114
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:20,119
What?

115
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,382
What are we doing?

116
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,056
What are-- What are you doing?

117
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:26,552
[mother] Get on, Helena.
[motorist] Whoa. Hang on.

118
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,224
- He'll be back soon.
- Who?

119
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,427
- Please, we have to go. Now!
- I--

120
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,364
- I don't wanna go!
- I can't just take you.

121
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,862
I'm not even sure where we are.
That's why I'm--

122
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:35,497
[gunshot]

123
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,730

124
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,702

- [Helena] Father!
- [mother] Helena?

[Helena shouting] No!

134
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,833
Stop! Stop!

135
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,221
Somebody!

136
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,521
Somebody!

Look who's awake.

140
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,453
It's okay, Helena.

141
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,621
Your mother's
just in the next room.

142
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:41,488
Where's my father?

143
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:45,131
He's not here. You're safe now.

144
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,332
There's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

145
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,698
Don't worry about that.

146
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,603

[mother] Helena.

150
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,017
We shouldn't be here.
I want to go home.

151
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,655
- That wasn't our home.
- What did you do?

152
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,629
What did you do?

153
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,629
- I want Father.
- [whispering]
He can't be near us.

154
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,895
Ever again.

155
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,734
He took me, Helena.

156
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:28,936
Jacob...

157
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,272
kidnapped me
and took me to the woods.

158
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:33,740
You're lying.

159
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,177
You're a liar.
You have always been a liar.

160
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,713
Father told me.

161
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,582
Stop crying!

162
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,521
You're not allowed to do that.

163
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,622
[police officer]
We need to let your mother rest.

164
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,591
Just for a few minutes.

165
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,726
We'll be okay. Helena?

Okay, we have to go. Come on.

You did good. Come on.

181
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,758

186
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:12,271

On your stomach!

188
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:15,801
Now!

189

Let me see your hands.

191
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,374
I'll come find you,

start charging you rent for me.

205
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,075
She did, huh?
[Marigold] What does that mean?

206
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,575
It means you are so valuable,
she thinks I should pay for you.

207
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,277
Whatcha got here?

208
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,747
My science project.
It's a habitat.
[Helena] Uh-huh.

209
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:42,515
Habitat? Who's the habitat for?

210
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,451
A baby deer.

211
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:49,258
It sleeps over here,
beside the rocks,
to keep it safe from hunters.

212
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:50,691
Smart deer.

A walnut.

217
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,871
From which tree?
You tell me.

218
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:03,908
There.

219
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:04,903
Mm-hmm.

220
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,177
[Marigold] And what's that tree?

221
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:08,512
A red oak.

222
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,445
It doesn't look red to me.

223
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,216
It will be in the fall.

224
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,546

How do you know all the names?

228
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:21,956
I can teach you if you want.

229
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:24,161
[Marigold]
I can see a bunny rabbit.

230
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:25,929
[Helena] Where?

231
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:29,933
You have to kind of
tilt your head. See the ears?

232
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,938
Oh, yeah. I see it.
With the tail down this way?

233
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,101
Yeah.

234
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:40,074
[Jacob] It means that we're one.

235
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,616
Family.

236
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:45,816

237
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,214
When can I have one of these?

238
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,049
[Helena]
Not until you're 82 years old.

239
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,850
That's the rule, remember?

240
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,218
That's not fair.

241
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,421
You got them
when you were young.

242
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,830
I was much older than you,
and I wish I hadn't.

243
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:02,133
I like them.

244
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:03,266
I like you.

Put your stuff inside, sweetie.

Sorry we're late.

I forgot about
your thing tonight.

252
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,427
That's all right. Let's just go.

253
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,159
I have to change. Why don't you
go on over with her,
and I'll come later.

254
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:35,098
Well, we've tried that.
You never show.

I'm just not good
at those things.
Neither am I.

256

Which is why you're coming with.

257

Too many. [chuckles]

273

you're from San Francisco.

We moved around a lot.
What'd your parents do?

my mom sometimes did telemarketing.

Ms. Erikkson.
My name is Pelletier.

Before that,
it was Jones, correct?

Then Mitchell,

from Bekkum.

to contact you recently?
- No.

Are you sure? Not even once?

312
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,446

You didn't need to come here.

doesn't know my last name,

for your family
and friends? Have any of your--

324

Jacob Holbrook is my father.

in a car accident.

that's the Marsh King guy.

of him coming here?

That's what we're trying
to find out.

336
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,327
He doesn't know where I live.

00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,636
- Who are these people?
- Police. They're just--

your phone
and any computers you use.

With any luck,
your father will be found soon.

You don't know my father.

345
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:33,786

you'll never see him again.

00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,037
[spouse] <i>Yeah?</i>

357
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:25,272
You guys coming home?

358
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:28,514
[spouse] <i>I grabbed a hotel room
for the night.
Mari's in the pool.</i>

359
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:32,617
[Helena] I could bring her over
some school clothes,
if you want.

360
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:35,615
[spouse]
<i>I'm keeping her out tomorrow,
just in case.</i>

361
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,350
I didn't think
this would happen.

362
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,790
<i>That I'd find out?</i>

363
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,194
No. I mean, I wish I--

364
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:43,825
<i>Mari's yelling for me.
I gotta go.</i>

365
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:45,394
[line clicks]

366
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:13,147
[Jacob] <i>Little Shadow.</i>

367
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,950
Time to check our snares.

368
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,815
And a real hunter...

369
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:21,160
needs a real knife.

370
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,824
This is yours now.

371
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:29,597
Let's see how you do with it.

372
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:38,771
[insects chirping, buzzing]

373
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:25,003
Hi.

374
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,941
I called earlier,
but you didn't answer.

375
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:31,614
I'm not great with phones.

376
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:33,946
That's an understatement.

377
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,551
I saw the news.

378
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:39,358
Thought I'd shoot down
and say hello.

379
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,591
Hello, Clark.

380
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:45,089
Maybe grab a glass of water
before I head back.

381
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:53,669
[sighs]

382
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:01,810
I know you
don't want me dropping in,

383
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,515
but I figured
everything's changed a bit now.

384
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:07,284
Cat's outta the bag.

385
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:08,952
How's your husband taking it?

386
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,455
Not well.

387
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,051
He'll come around.
Just a matter of time.

388
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,692
The little one's
not so little anymore.

389
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:20,424
Your mother
would've loved to have met her.

390
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:24,695
I thought you might bring
Marigold up home a while back,

391
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,933
at least for the funeral.

392
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,067
She wouldn't have
met her then either.

393
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:31,874
That's true enough.

394
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,545
Then, I guess I meant
I wish you woulda come sooner.

395
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:36,778
She would've liked that.

396
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:43,653
He still has that job
at the college?

397
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:47,558
You still doing--
Nothing's changed.

398
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:50,090
Okay. [sighs]

399
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,325
This is not how I saw this
playing out.

400
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:57,931
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I just can't do this right now.

401
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,007
Well,
at least it's not in the press.

402
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,575
No one's putting you with him.

403
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:14,552
Just wanted to make sure
you weren't worried
about things.

404
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:16,752
I'm not.

405
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:22,621
You know, there was a space
when you were about 13 or so.

406
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:27,125
I thought we had a shot at bei''
a nice little family,
the three of us.

407
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,634
It was never the three of us, Clark.

408
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:33,230
She didn't want me around.

409
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:35,771
When she looked at me,
she saw my father.

410
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:37,608
So did you.

411
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:39,509
No.

412
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,480
You're forgetting
some good days.

413
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:43,911
She loved you.

414
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,144
I still love you.

415
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,916
I miss you.

416
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:54,158
But sure, maybe sometimes
we saw a little Jacob in you.

417
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:55,758
[vehicle approaching]

418
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:58,189
Or maybe you never saw
enough of him in me.

419
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:03,965
[police radio chatter]

420
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,336
[Clark]
You here to relieve this fella?
[officer] No, I'm supposed to--

421
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:12,341
Mrs. Pelletier,
the FBI would like you
to come down to the office.

422
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:13,671
Did something come up?

423
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,173
Way above my pay grade.

424
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:17,978
You want me to come with you?

425
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,619
We found your father's body.

426
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,756
Just inside the state line.

427
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:27,551
We assume they were heading
for a crossing to Canada.

428
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:30,220
Guard rail,
60 feet up on the embankment
was splintered.

429
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:32,793
Driver either lost control
or fell asleep.

430
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,127
The car hit a tree
and caught fire.

431
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,935
Both men were burned
beyond recognition.

432
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:41,067
We think they had an accomplice.
We're looking for him now.

433
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,103
How can you be sure
it's Holbrook?

434
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:52,111
He has three gold teeth
with carvings
matching your father.

435
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:57,116
[inhales deeply]

436
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,756
You all right?

437
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,695
My father died 20 years ago.

438
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,687
[car approaching]

439
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:40,060
[Helena] Mmm.

440
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:43,397
I'm sorry about your daddy.

441
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:45,564
We saw it on TV.

442
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,137
Thank you, sweetie,
but he wasn't my daddy
for a long time.

443
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:52,303
We brought you some food
in case you didn't wanna cook.

444
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,605
Let me guess, extra pepperoni?

445
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:58,980
- I'm definitely in the mood
for pizza.
- Yes!

446
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:03,952
How you doing?

447
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:05,756
I'm fine.

448
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:12,125
I wish you would've told me
the truth. [sighs]

449
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,733
What's the worst
that could've happened?

450
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,935
- We wouldn't have Mari.
- You don't know that.

451
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:22,403
Yes, I do.

452
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:26,036
Who in their right mind
would get involved
with the daughter...

453
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:30,679
If you knew my name
was Holbrook, you'd never have
gone on a date with me.

454
00:43:30,814 --> 00:43:32,509
You would've run the other way.

455
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,450
- You will now.
- Hold on.

456
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:39,989
Let's pretend
that I'm a better person
than you think I am, all right?

457
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,157
What's the best thing
that could've happened?

458
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:45,423
You might've found
somebody to trust.

459
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:49,999
Someone to help you through
all the shitty days.

460
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:52,902
Somebody to explain
all your weird tattoos to.

461
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,141
The best never happens, Stephen.

462
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:03,715
No matter how badly we want it.

463
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:27,799
Marigold okay?
Yeah.

464
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,169
She's asleep.

465
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:32,073
Do you really believe that?

466
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,242
What you said before about...

467
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,610
the best never happening.

468
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:44,151
[inhales sharply]
Because if you do,
what's that mean for us?

469
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:51,396
Look I--
I don't wanna make
this any worse for you.

470
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:54,062
But you gotta let me in, Helena.

471
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:02,873
Okay, look.
I'm gonna go do some work
at the office.

472
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:06,371
Probably sleep over there.

473
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:15,281
[footsteps departing]
[door closes]

474
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:23,256
[sighs]

475
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,346
[tires screeching]

476
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:43,881
[exhales sharply]

477
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:53,990
My name is Helena Holbrook.

478
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:58,555
Remember the guy
who kidnapped that woman?

479
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:02,130
The one everybody called
The Marsh King?

480
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:05,166
I'm his daughter.

481
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:16,278
Sometimes I sneak off alone
at night because I feel trapped.

482
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:20,577
Like I can't figure out
which world I really belong in.

483
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,390
I have trouble trusting people because...

484
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,459
everyone tells me
the person I believed
in the most

485
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,868
was really a monster.

486
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:44,403
He gave me this
after my first kill.

487
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:56,580
And this one when I missed.

488
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,959
This is the place
he taught me to swim.

489
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:05,622
[sniffles]

490
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:10,968
The name he gave me.

491
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:16,435
This to remind me never to wait
to do my chores.

492
00:47:21,512 --> 00:47:25,015
These were the only tears
my father ever wanted to see.

493
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,484
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

494
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,186
[Stephen] Come on. I know.
[Marigold] I can do it.

495
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:06,488
I have been looking forward
to this day.

496
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:09,058
Thought it was time
to introduce you
to a couple people.

497
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:11,055
[Marigold] Look, Daddy,
they have horses.

498
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:14,828
This is Clark.
He's gonna try his best
to get you to call him Grandpa.

499
00:48:14,963 --> 00:48:16,426
Make him earn it.

500
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,595
That doesn't scare me a bit.

501
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,399
I've got no one else
to spend it on.

502
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:23,000
It is very nice to meet you, Marigold.

503
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:24,540
You too, Clark.

504
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:25,972
[Clark chuckles]

505
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:27,339
I'm gonna like this one.

506
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:29,706
Would you like
to see the horses?

507
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:49,726
[humming in distance]

508
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:16,192
[humming continues]

509
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:26,169
[humming stops]

510
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:31,471
[Clark] Who's getting hungry?

511
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:41,279
[Clark chuckles]

512
00:49:41,414 --> 00:49:43,317
Two hours after I took that,

513
00:49:43,453 --> 00:49:45,849
I started getting calls
that some hoodlum

514
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,590
was setting off fireworks
in people's yards.

515
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:52,024
She tore that dress to shreds,
running from one of my deputies.

516
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,893
You can stop now.

517
00:49:54,028 --> 00:49:56,160
Oh, hell, we haven't even got
to your difficult stage yet.

518
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:58,102
Who's that?

519
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:02,304
[Clark] That's your grandmother.

520
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:05,703
You definitely take after her.

521
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,912
I don't remember that picture.

522
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,083
[Marigold] It looks like us.

523
00:50:16,984 --> 00:50:20,289
You know, I wouldn't complain
if this became a habit.

524
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:29,364
Thank you, Clark.

525
00:50:29,964 --> 00:50:31,201
Anytime.

526
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:33,501
Hey.

527
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:36,766
You know,
Jacob took a lot
of my people's beliefs,

528
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:40,441
twisted 'em
to fit what suited him.

529
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:46,744
Means "owned" in Ojibwa.
Not "family."

530
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:48,779
Don't confuse the two.

531
00:51:17,546 --> 00:51:19,276
- [Stephen gasps]
- [tires screeching]

532
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:21,779
Sh-- [breathes heavily]

533
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:56,253
[Jacob] Little Shadow.

534
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:08,463
[gasps]

535
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:12,632
[Stephen] What's wrong?

536
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,471
[sighs]

537
00:52:17,274 --> 00:52:19,705
I'm just getting some water.

538
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,680
[door opens]

539
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,845
[breathes heavily]

540
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:32,104
[sighs] Hey,
make sure you wipe your feet
when you come in the house.

541
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,509
I did.

542
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:35,841
I'll drop her on the way.

543
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:37,877
See you after.

544
00:54:38,113 --> 00:54:39,813
We'll go swimming or something.
Don't forget my goggles.

545
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:42,314
I got that conference
in Detroit this afternoon.

546
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,684
Might be home late.

547
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,049
You gonna be okay?
Mmm.

548
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:54,497
[chattering]

549
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:58,765
Thank you.

550
00:55:04,106 --> 00:55:05,204
Helena?

551
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,740
How you doing?

552
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,213
Good. Fine.

553
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:10,943
Are you guys
around this weekend?

554
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,477
I was thinking Jess and Marigold
could have a playdate.

555
00:55:13,612 --> 00:55:17,619
Oh, yeah.
I think we're free, just...
[birdcall whistling]

556
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:24,191
Sorry. Yeah, she'd love that.

557
00:55:24,326 --> 00:55:26,828
How's Saturday?
Would she like
to come over to our place?

558
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:30,265
Of course.
She has swim until 10:00
but after that...

559
00:55:30,401 --> 00:55:32,700
[birdcall whistling continues]

560
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:44,877
Can you hold on a second? Sorry.

561
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:34,696
[grunts]

562
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:04,520
You're not helping.

563
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:08,526
I'm not supposed to help.
This is your homework, not mine.

564
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:09,892
But you always help.

565
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:12,136
Well, you can figure this out.

566
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:15,231
Why are you in a bad mood again?

567
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,936
I'm not.

568
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:19,405
I don't mean to be.

569
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:23,673
Let's go read. We'll get Daddy
to help us finish
in the morning.

570
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:25,747
Okay?
Okay.

571
00:57:29,515 --> 00:57:32,521
[Helena] "Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool

572
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,252
like a carpet patterned
with flowers.

573
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:38,656
And on this carpet,
lay a young and beautiful woman.

574
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:44,431
The mother cried,
'Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?'

575
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:46,097
And the daughter said..."

576
00:57:48,938 --> 00:57:51,740
Hey, daughter?
You missed your entrance.

577
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,305
[Beth] <i>Helena.</i>

578
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,925
[young Helena] What is it?
It's a doll.

579
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:47,598
You-- You play with it.

580
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:49,666
Like a friend.

581
00:58:56,308 --> 00:58:57,300
She has hair like me.

582
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,006
A tiny Helena.

583
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:04,747
[bell tinkles]

584
00:59:22,795 --> 00:59:26,263
[breathes heavily]

585
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:42,180
[bell tinkles]

586
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:00,000
[rustles]

587
01:00:21,523 --> 01:00:22,759
[door slams]

588
01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:25,993
Oh, God.

589
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:29,392
Marigold!

590
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:31,427
[grunts]

591
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,102
[gasps, grunts]

592
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:35,238
Helena!

593
01:00:35,373 --> 01:00:36,499
Hey, it's me.

594
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:37,800
It's me.

595
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,171
[panting]

596
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:42,039
Jesus. What are you...

597
01:00:42,174 --> 01:00:45,145
Uh... I--
Whose blood is that?

598
01:00:45,281 --> 01:00:48,583
No one's. A rabbit.
I heard somebody outside.

599
01:00:48,718 --> 01:00:50,316
Maybe try calling the police

600
01:00:50,552 --> 01:00:53,082
instead of running around
in the dark
with a knife.

601
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:57,393
- [panting] I have to check
on Marigold.
- Marigold's fine. She's asleep.

602
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,621
I just left her room.

603
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:00,593
Did you see anyone out there?

604
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:03,428
[panting continues]

605
01:01:03,564 --> 01:01:05,066
Hey.

606
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:07,536
We're gonna keep
the doors locked,
all right?

607
01:01:07,672 --> 01:01:09,300
Get a few cop cars on patrol.

608
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:13,073
It's gonna be okay.

609
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,206
[Helena] <i>It was bleeding
from the head.</i>

610
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:48,911
Like someone killed it first,
then put it in the snare.

611
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,678
Or maybe it got injured
some other way.

612
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:57,179
What's got you spooked?
Why do you think
there's something more?

613
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,757
I feel like he's here.

614
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:02,658
[inhales deeply]
<i>The night you found us,</i>

615
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:04,355
<i>when we came out of the woods,</i>

616
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:07,226
I was so afraid
because he wasn't there with me.

617
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:10,094
But then he came.

618
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:11,931
Don't get lost in this, Helena.

619
01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:13,903
<i>Now he's come back again.</i>

620
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,533
<i>I have to tell him
to leave us alone.</i>

621
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:19,770
You have got to try to get him
out of your head.

622
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:21,072
For good.

623
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,512
[sighs] I'm not sure
I can do that.

624
01:02:23,647 --> 01:02:25,311
How could he be alive?

625
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:27,147
I don't know.

626
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,886
[Jacob] <i>There's nothing purer
than the instinct to survive.</i>

627
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:38,323
[wolf whines]

628
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:40,930
[growling]

629
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,017
[Marigold] Mommy!

630
01:03:03,652 --> 01:03:05,515
[Helena panting]

631
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,023
Marigold?

632
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,557
I couldn't find my backpack.

633
01:03:12,693 --> 01:03:13,963
[sighs]

634
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,560
Oh, no, no, no. That stays here.

635
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,232
I wanna show people.

636
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:22,436
Let's wait a while on that, okay?

637
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,973
Okay.

638
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:35,147
Where did you get those?

639
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:38,015
I thought you made them.
I like them.

640
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,088
Looks like you and me.

641
01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:47,095
- [birds chirping]
- [wings flapping]

642
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:53,904
Has the habitat been
in your room
the whole time?

643
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:56,104
Mm-hmm.

644
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:13,089
[breathes heavily]

645
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,024
What are you doing?

646
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,560
[keys jingling]

647
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:25,936
Come on.

648
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,301
[Helena]
<i>Stay inside after school
unless Daddy</i>

649
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:37,112
<i>or I are here, okay?
Don't go with anyone else,
no matter what they say.</i>

650
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,034
What's this about?

651
01:05:04,169 --> 01:05:05,469
Just felt like it.

652
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:08,303
<i>Can you pick Marigold up
after school?</i>

653
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:10,673
[Stephen] <i>Of course.</i>

654
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:12,412
<i>Why?</i>

655
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:17,152
[Helena] <i>I have to do something.
I can't tell you what it is.</i>

656
01:05:23,392 --> 01:05:25,226
[Stephen]
<i>What's going on, Helena?</i>

657
01:05:26,696 --> 01:05:30,363
[Helena]
<i>I know I haven't given you
any reason to...</i>

658
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,432
<i>please trust me.</i>

659
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,303
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

660
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:38,635
[Stephen] <i>Back from where?</i>

661
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,638
[Helena] <i>Last secret, Stephen.</i>

662
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:44,080
<i>Promise.</i>

663
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:06,531
You and Mari rescued me.

664
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:12,855
[young Helena]
<i>I can call it anything I want?</i>

665
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,759
[Jacob] It's yours.
I gave it to you.

666
01:08:19,836 --> 01:08:21,171
I name it

667
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:23,569
Helena Falls.

668
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,229
[footsteps approaching]

669
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:31,301
[Jacob] Hello, Little Shadow.

670
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,833
[chuckles]

671
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:14,069
[inhales sharply]

672
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,677
Let's go for a walk.

673
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,495
How did you find me?

674
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,699
I never lost you, Little Shadow.

675
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:49,379
[sighs]

676
01:11:51,477 --> 01:11:53,350
I miss that smell.

677
01:11:56,482 --> 01:11:57,915
And the taste.

678
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,887
Gimme that.

679
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,835
My favorite knife.

680
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:32,147
[scoffs]

681
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:41,563
We used to come camping up here,
you remember?

682
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:45,330
We'd lay out here
all summer long.

683
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:46,765
Look up at the sky,

684
01:12:46,967 --> 01:12:48,636
see who could count
the most shooting stars.

685
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,573
I used to cheat
and count airplanes.

686
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,905
[chuckles]

687
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:58,946
You knew I was alive
the whole time,
didn't you?

688
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:01,682
I didn't know
how it was possible.

689
01:13:02,652 --> 01:13:05,081
Not until I saw
a three-legged coyote.

690
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:08,817
Sacrificed its own leg
for freedom.

691
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:11,320
Like you sacrificed your teeth.

692
01:13:11,456 --> 01:13:13,495
Ah.

693
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,728
Probably won't pass
a medical exam,

694
01:13:15,864 --> 01:13:18,028
but it bought you
the time you needed.

695
01:13:19,665 --> 01:13:21,438
You did some digging.

696
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:23,704
Well done.

697
01:13:28,944 --> 01:13:31,481
You didn't tell anyone else
your theory?

698
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:34,847
Did you?

699
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,085
Wish you'd brought Marigold.

700
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:45,190
Tell me about my granddaughter.

701
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:49,191
I don't think so.
You know enough
about her already.

702
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:54,603
Well, I had to take a peek.

703
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,805
You never brought her
to visit me.

704
01:14:00,609 --> 01:14:02,237
You didn't visit me at all.

705
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:07,909
Come on, Little Shadow.

706
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:09,816
I want to show you something.

707
01:14:12,523 --> 01:14:15,822
You know,
Marigold looks like her.

708
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:17,420
Your mother.

709
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,794
I bet she loves the water
as much as we do.

710
01:14:25,703 --> 01:14:27,735
That's to take us
across the border.

711
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:29,704
The three of us.

712
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:32,806
To Canada,
we can be a family again.

713
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:34,703
I have a family.

714
01:14:34,839 --> 01:14:36,209
You have a daughter.

715
01:14:36,345 --> 01:14:37,647
And a husband.

716
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:39,714
We've built a life together.

717
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,211
Are you happy with that life?

718
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,817
Not always.

719
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,054
Do you ever think
back to what it was like

720
01:14:48,523 --> 01:14:49,622
when we lived here?

721
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:53,530
- I do.
- We can have it all again.

722
01:14:56,129 --> 01:14:59,101
I remember
when you were four years old,

723
01:14:59,237 --> 01:15:01,067
you could shut your eyes

724
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:06,374
and you knew where you were
from the sound of the water,

725
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:09,370
from the smell of the trees,

726
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:14,083
and the feel of the ground
beneath your feet.

727
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,915
It was like magic.

728
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:21,090
This is where we belong.

729
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,054
It's our home.

730
01:15:23,557 --> 01:15:25,023
Our life here

731
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:27,223
was perfect.

732
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:31,227
[birds squawking]

733
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:40,240
[water splashing]

734
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,476
[Beth] No!

735
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:46,316
[water splashing]
[Beth struggling]

736
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:47,782
[Jacob grunts]
[Beth] No!

737
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:54,383
[Jacob] Don't you ever run away
from me again!

738
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:56,692
Okay? You hear me?

739
01:15:59,659 --> 01:16:01,064
[Beth gasping]

740
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,258
I wasn't--

741
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,196
[gasping, crying]

742
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,168
Perfect?

743
01:16:12,837 --> 01:16:14,073
Not for my mother.

744
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:16,175
Well, it could've been.

745
01:16:16,311 --> 01:16:17,408
How?

746
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:21,743
- You kidnapped her.
- No. We ran away together.

747
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:25,282
That's just something she said
when she decided to leave.

748
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:28,049
- You shot that man.
- I was trying to hit the engine.

749
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,659
You never would have missed.

750
01:16:30,722 --> 01:16:32,356
I missed.

751
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:35,727
[scoffs]
You've been told a bunch
of stories about me.

752
01:16:35,862 --> 01:16:40,065
They're not true.
I never was the Marsh King,
until they said I was.

753
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:44,674
I know this, we were happy.

754
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,874
You were happy.

755
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,345
All I'm saying, bring Marigold,
let her see for herself.

756
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,946
I can't do that.

757
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,311
I won't.

758
01:16:56,886 --> 01:16:58,721
I'm sorry.
This is where it ends.

759
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:02,923
I shouldn't have come here.

760
01:17:05,923 --> 01:17:07,796
I'm glad I did.

761
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:14,696
Now I have to go home
to my family.

762
01:17:15,432 --> 01:17:18,404
Please don't come
near them again.

763
01:17:19,274 --> 01:17:22,041
- It doesn't need to be
like this.
- It does.

764
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:28,245
Okay.

765
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:29,844
Okay.

766
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,853
I understand.

767
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:41,863
You'll always be
my Little Shadow.

768
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:47,297
I have to go.

769
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,269
Clark?

770
01:18:26,606 --> 01:18:29,843
- What are you doing here?
- Could ask you the same thing.

771
01:18:29,978 --> 01:18:32,210
Stephen called me.
He was worried.

772
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:35,280
And I just had a hunch
after what you said.

773
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:40,047
- Is he here?
- Let's go back.
I'll tell you on the way.

774
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:43,089
Helena, was he here?

775
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:45,993
But he's gone.

776
01:18:48,828 --> 01:18:50,294
[hammer cocks]

777
01:18:51,235 --> 01:18:52,131
[shouts]

778
01:18:52,764 --> 01:18:54,364
[grunts]

779
01:19:00,972 --> 01:19:02,711
Clark. Clark.

780
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:05,848
[Clark wheezes]
Clark. Oh, God. Oh, God.

781
01:19:08,717 --> 01:19:10,519
Clark, look at me, okay?

782
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:12,386
Clark. Clark, stay with me.

783
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:15,784
You told him
you were coming here?
No, I didn't say anything.

784
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,559
Please, look at me.

785
01:19:17,694 --> 01:19:19,554
Clark, I'm right here.

786
01:19:21,096 --> 01:19:23,126
Clark, hold on.
Please, Clark, hold on.

787
01:19:23,261 --> 01:19:25,127
You must've said something.

788
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:27,134
Make your stepfather curious.

789
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:30,202
Enough to wander out here
all this way by himself.

790
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:32,974
Just get away from us.
What have you done?

791
01:19:34,876 --> 01:19:37,011
Please, Clark. Please. Come on.

792
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,881
Come on. Please.

793
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,178
Well, there's nothing you can do
to help him now.

794
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:44,150
- [Helena screams, cries]
- [Jacob grunts]

795
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:47,856
No!

796
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,222
You'd rather the wolf lived
than us?

797
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,623
You want it to feed you
to its pup?

798
01:19:55,559 --> 01:19:57,928
Now I have to get Marigold
on my own.

799
01:19:58,064 --> 01:20:00,500
No! Don't you touch her!

800
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:02,366
[struggling]

801
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,868
[screams, grunts]

802
01:20:06,003 --> 01:20:07,470
[panting]

803
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:13,015
We can still all be a family.

804
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,543
It's all I want.

805
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,385
I'll be back with Marigold soon.

806
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,251
No! No, no.

807
01:20:21,325 --> 01:20:22,353
No!

808
01:20:23,393 --> 01:20:24,421
No!

809
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:28,260
[whimpering]

810
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:37,269
[thudding]
[whimpering continues]

811
01:20:51,488 --> 01:20:53,516
[wolf howls]

812
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,433
[footsteps approaching]

813
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,903
[Beth] Helena.

814
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,673
Wrap the rope around you.

815
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:22,480
Did he say I could come up?

816
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:24,947
I don't care,
I'm getting you out of there.

817
01:21:25,082 --> 01:21:27,385
[both grunting]

818
01:21:32,389 --> 01:21:34,458
I've got you, my Helena.

819
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,560
You're gonna be fine.

820
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,234
Because you're stronger than me.

821
01:21:42,737 --> 01:21:44,039
Braver than me.

822
01:21:47,437 --> 01:21:50,507
[exhales sharply, grunts]

823
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:06,589

[grunting]

835
01:23:25,641 --> 01:23:27,076
Please.

836
01:23:29,975 --> 01:23:31,377
Clark.

837
01:23:36,785 --> 01:23:38,615
[sobbing]

838
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:44,687
I'm so sorry.

839
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,506
I'll come back for you.

840
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:08,447
[grunting]

841
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,850

01:26:48,538 --> 01:26:50,004
[Jacob grunts]

847
01:27:43,698 --> 01:27:45,929
[Jacob] <i>Is the blood warm
or cold?</i>

848
01:27:46,832 --> 01:27:48,136
Cold.
[young Helena] <i>Cold.</i>

849
01:27:48,405 --> 01:27:50,900
[Jacob]
<i>Then you must move faster.</i>

850
01:28:33,414 --> 01:28:35,384
<i>Running or walking?</i>

851
01:28:39,617 --> 01:28:41,390
[young Helena] <i>Running.</i>

852
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:45,125
[Jacob] <i>And if you were afraid,</i>

853
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:46,990
<i>running for your life,</i>

854
01:28:47,593 --> 01:28:49,123
<i>where would you run?</i>

855
01:28:54,132 --> 01:28:56,537
[young Helena]
<i>To where no one could see me.</i>

856
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,948
You know what you taught me.

857
01:30:11,575 --> 01:30:12,811
[rustling]

858
01:30:13,746 --> 01:30:15,748

[gasps, grunts]

861
01:31:09,037 --> 01:31:11,837
[Jacob] You're fine,
it's just a flesh wound.

862
01:31:12,338 --> 01:31:13,334
Now...

863
01:31:14,037 --> 01:31:15,910
what good will it do Marigold

864
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:20,076
if her mother is lying rotting
in the bottom of the marsh?

865
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:22,111
She needs you.

866
01:31:23,446 --> 01:31:26,118
Just think about
what's best for your daughter.

867
01:31:26,253 --> 01:31:27,281
Okay?

868
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,756
[Helena] No!

869
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,660
[grunts] No!

870
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:37,258
[panting]
The boat you came in. Show me.

871
01:32:22,276 --> 01:32:23,304
Go on.

872
01:32:25,276 --> 01:32:27,880
I waited my whole life
to see you again.

873
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,317
I wasn't sure what I would feel
when I did.

874
01:32:32,453 --> 01:32:35,089
- What do you feel,
Little Shadow?
- Don't call me that.

875
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:36,219
Not anymore.

876
01:32:37,489 --> 01:32:40,255
I used to think you said it
because I was always beside you.

877
01:32:41,696 --> 01:32:43,627
Now I realize you just meant,

878
01:32:43,762 --> 01:32:47,065
like any shadow,
I wouldn't exist
if you weren't standing there.

879
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,303
Your mother did a job on you
after I was gone.

880
01:32:50,438 --> 01:32:51,973
No, she didn't.

881
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:54,602
I barely spoke
to her my whole life.

882
01:32:55,605 --> 01:32:58,476
I blamed her for everything too.
I never believed her.

883
01:32:58,611 --> 01:33:03,616
You really think she cared
about you
the way I care about you?

884
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:06,017
She wouldn't have a gun on me.

885
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:10,153
She could have run.

886
01:33:11,293 --> 01:33:12,727
Gotten away.

887
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,697
She stayed to protect me.

888
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:19,562
Now I know,
she was the strong one.

889
01:33:19,698 --> 01:33:21,331
She was weak.

890
01:33:21,467 --> 01:33:22,529
No.

891
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:27,835
A man who drags a woman
into the wilderness is weak.

892
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:30,943
Careful, Little Shadow.

893
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:38,215
You forget all the things
that I did for you.

894
01:33:38,884 --> 01:33:41,951
The years I spent in a cage

895
01:33:42,086 --> 01:33:45,056
'cause I came back for you.

896
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:48,290
What would you do for Marigold?

897
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:02,975
I'd die for her.

898
01:34:23,728 --> 01:34:25,360
[screams]

899
01:34:33,275 --> 01:34:34,604
Daddy!

900
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:35,975
[gasping]

901
01:34:40,812 --> 01:34:43,015
Come on. Come on.

902
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,887
- [Helena grunts, shouts]
- [Jacob shouts]

903
01:34:49,955 --> 01:34:51,826
[both shouting, grunting]

904
01:35:27,759 --> 01:35:31,998
[Helena] <i>"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool</i>

905
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:34,663
<i>like a carpet patterned
with flowers.</i>

906
01:35:34,799 --> 01:35:39,638
<i>And on this carpet lay
a strong and beautiful woman.</i>

907
01:35:39,774 --> 01:35:46,414
The mother cried,
'Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?'

908
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,146
And the daughter said..."

909
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:50,412
"Is it me I see,

910
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:53,218
mirrored in yours?"

911
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:56,887
"Then the child rose
in the shape of a mighty swan

912
01:35:57,022 --> 01:35:59,423
and spread her powerful wings."

913
01:35:59,559 --> 01:36:00,796
[gasps]

914
01:36:06,063 --> 01:36:08,463
[grunting, panting]

915
01:36:18,215 --> 01:36:19,375
[groans]

916
01:36:30,789 --> 01:36:32,025
[grunting]

917
01:36:35,859 --> 01:36:37,096
[shouts]

918
01:36:40,032 --> 01:36:41,969
- [shouts]
- [grunts]

919
01:36:58,148 --> 01:36:59,921
I don't hate you.

920
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,887
I don't pity you.

921
01:37:03,022 --> 01:37:05,289
I just remember your lesson.

922
01:37:07,059 --> 01:37:08,890
Always protect my family.

923
01:37:09,026 --> 01:37:10,426
[Jacob shouts]

924
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:28,642
[whimpering]

925
01:37:29,946 --> 01:37:31,183
[crying]

926
01:38:07,886 --> 01:38:09,122
[grunting]

927
01:38:27,842 --> 01:38:29,472
[grunting continues]
