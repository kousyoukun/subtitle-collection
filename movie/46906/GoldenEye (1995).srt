1
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:00,112
I beg your pardon.
I forgot to knock.

2
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,615
I'm alone.

3
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,268
Aren't we all?

4
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:57,961
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

5
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:59,556
Ready to save the world again?

6
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,720
After you, 006.

7
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,395
James, for England.

8
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,752
For England, Alec.

9
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,151
It's too easy.

10
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,551
Half of everything is luck, James.

11
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,637
And the other half?

12
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,972
Fate.

13
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:06,681
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes, check.

14
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,625
Fire!

15
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:39,204
Closing time, James!
Last call!

16
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,972
Buy me a pint.

17
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,135
This is Colonel Ourumov! Come out
with your hands above your heads!

18
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,472
How original.

19
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:08,016
Shut the door, Alec!
There's a draft!

20
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,096
Alec?

21
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:28,542
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

22
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,616
Finish the job, James!
Blow them all to hell!

23
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,190
You have ten seconds.

24
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:35,832
Ten...

25
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,019
nine... eight...

26
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,017
seven... six...

27
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:44,902
five...

28
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:47,427
four... three... two...

29
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,991
For England, James!

30
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,977
Hold your fire!
You'll blow the gas tanks!

31
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,787
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands above your...

32
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:05,086
Wait!

33
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,490
You can't win.

34
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:08,733
Get out there! Move!
Move it!

35
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,191
Hold your fire!

36
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:00,094
Wait!

37
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:09,693
James, is it really necessary
to drive quite so fast?

38
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,368
More often than you'd think.

39
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:24,764
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

40
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:30,471
- Who's that?
- The next girl.

41
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:36,651
James, stop this! Stop it!
I know what you're doing.

42
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,608
Really?
What's that, dear?

43
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:41,588
You are just trying to show off
the size of your, your...

44
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,338
- Engine?
- Ego.

45
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,558
We're having a pleasant drive, and
you've got to bring psychology into it.

46
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,722
I was just sent here
to evaluate you.

47
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:51,635
Let's try and put that
behind us, shall we?

48
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,093
Ladies first.

49
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,634
- James, I want you to stop this car.
- Really?

50
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:47,435
Stop this car at once!

51
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:59,185
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

52
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,544
James, you're incorrigible.

53
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,411
What am I going to do with you?

54
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:13,934
Well, let's toast your evaluation,
shall we?

55
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:22,222
A very thorough evaluation.

56
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,859
Madame wins.

57
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,599
Bet, Mademoiselle? No?

58
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,596
Monsieur?

59
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,285
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

60
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:31,836
No players?

61
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:50,100
It appears we share the same passions.
Three, anyway.

62
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,042
I count two.

63
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,622
Motoring and baccarat.

64
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,226
Seven. Madame wins.

65
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:07,859
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

66
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,839
One rises to meet a challenge.

67
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,612
Madame stands with five.

68
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,459
Six. Madame loses.

69
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:58,930
Enjoy it while it lasts.

70
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,043
The very words I live by.

71
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,085
And what words do you live by?

72
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,831
The trick is to quit
while you're still ahead.

73
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:16,262
That's one trick I've never learned.
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

74
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:20,373
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

75
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,917
And for you?

76
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,511
The same.

77
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:26,451
How do you take it?

78
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,732
Straight up, with a twist.

79
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,183
Thank you, Mr... .?

80
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,274
The name's Bond.
James Bond.

81
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,586
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

82
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,651
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

83
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:47,026
Your accent, Georgian?

84
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:49,105
Very good, Mr. Bond.

85
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:51,083
- You've been to Russia?
- Not recently.

86
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,806
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

87
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:58,446
It's very different now,
a land of opportunity.

88
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,233
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

89
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,308
No, not quite.
That belongs to a friend.

90
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,913
A tip for your friend:

91
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,750
The French registration plates for this
year's model start with the letter 'L. '

92
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,594
Even the counterfeit ones.

93
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:17,179
Oh. And what rank
do you hold...

94
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:20,992
with the Motor Vehicles Department,
Mr. Bond?

95
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:22,562
Commander.

96
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:26,092
- Shall we go?
- This one is an Admiral.

97
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:29,779
I like a woman
who enjoys pulling rank.

98
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,318
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.

99
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:36,379
The pleasure, I'm sure,
was all mine.

100
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,335
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

101
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,837
Identification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

102
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:10,785
Current suspected links to the
Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg.

103
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:13,991
Yacht Manticore is leased to
a known Janus corporate front.

104
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:16,916
M authorizes you
to observe Miss Onatopp...

105
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:21,532
but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.

106
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:24,643
End transmission. Moneypenny.
Good night, James.

107
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,242
I trust you'll stay
'on-a-topp' of things.

108
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,695
Xenia, I can't breathe!

109
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,561
Yes! Yes!

110
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:29,010
My respects, Admiral.

111
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,515
Delighted to have you aboard,
Mademoiselle.

112
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,314
Ladies and gentlemen...

113
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:43,295
please take your seats on the upper deck
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

114
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:17,323
What you are about
to see in operation...

115
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,012
is Europe's answer
to the electronic battlefield:

116
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:23,532
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

117
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,226
Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger
not only uses stealth technology...

118
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,199
it is the only helicopter
to be hardened against...

119
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:31,247
all forms of
electronic interference...

120
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:33,864
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

121
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:46,412
I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

122
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,704
I think I've gone to heaven.

123
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:51,043
Not yet.

124
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:00,465
Now please welcome the pilots.

125
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,872
Lieutenant Commander
Bernard Jaubert...

126
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,793
and Lieutenant Francois Brouse.

127
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,129
Select Mir.

128
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,817
Autographic projection.

129
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,306
Compute possible intercept
with second stage geo-sat two.

130
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:31,719
Anna.

131
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,152
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

132
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:41,799
Boris.

133
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:45,120
- Boris!
- What?

134
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:50,528
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

135
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:54,094
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

136
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:57,182
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht for brains.

137
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:01,657
All right, all right,
I'll give you a hint.

138
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:06,040
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

139
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,498
You're such a geek.

140
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,956
Yes, I'm in!

141
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,754
You've hacked into
the U.S. Department of Justice.

142
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:24,723
Do you know what will happen
if they trace it here?

143
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:27,303
The Chief of Computers
will call me a genius...

144
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:31,601
move me to Moscow and give me
a million bucks hard currency.

145
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,890
I think not.

146
00:28:34,883 --> 00:28:39,513
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

147
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:45,081
- You were saying, slug-head?
- Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!

148
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:48,574
Spiked them!

149
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,672
Come on, Boris, just hang up.

150
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,389
No way! I spiked them!

151
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:57,925
All right, what's the password?

152
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,949
I'm not going to tell you.

153
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,806
Okay, let me guess.

154
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:05,383
It's not in front of me?

155
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:09,078
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

156
00:29:13,347 --> 00:29:16,874
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me...

157
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:20,068
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

158
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:23,764
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.

159
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:30,197
Better luck next time...

160
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:31,910
slug-heads!

161
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:34,014
Bang! Gone!

162
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,213
I am invincible!

163
00:29:41,795 --> 00:29:44,025
Was it good for you, too?

164
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:46,665
I'm getting some coffee.

165
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:48,561
I'm going for a cigarette.

166
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:53,302
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...

167
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,810
head of Space Division.

168
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,707
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

169
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:13,078
This is an unscheduled test of the
Severnaya facility. War simulation.

170
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:16,193
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

171
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,792
Two operational satellites, sir:
Petya and Mischa...

172
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:21,781
both in 90-minute earth orbit
at 100 kilometers.

173
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:25,690
Good. Here is the
authorization code.

174
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:29,596
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

175
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,532
I am timing you.

176
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:04,834
Good.
Thank you, Major.

177
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:42,622
On my count.

178
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,858
Three... two... one.

179
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:56,109
Set target: Severnaya.

180
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,158
Arm the weapon.

181
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:33,360
Check it!

182
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:49,086
Their best response time is 19 minutes.
They'll be late.

183
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:25,477
It's clean.
I had to ventilate someone.

184
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:03,672
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

185
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,883
M will meet you in the situation room.
I'm to take you straight in.

186
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:09,219
I've never seen you after hours,
Moneypenny. Lovely.

187
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:12,485
- Thank you, James.
- Out on a professional assignment?

188
00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:13,885
Dressing to kill?

189
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:16,519
I know you'll
find this crushing, 007...

190
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:20,112
but I don't sit at home every night
praying for an international incident...

191
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,697
so I can run down here all dressed up
to impress James Bond.

192
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:26,849
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theater together.

193
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:29,347
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

194
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:31,783
What would I ever do without you?

195
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:35,307
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

196
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:41,229
Hope springs eternal.

197
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:44,748
You know, this sort of behavior
could qualify as sexual harassment.

198
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,202
Really?
What's the penalty for that?

199
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,099
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendos.

200
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:58,507
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist.

201
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,026
You first.

202
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:07,130
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What's up?

203
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:07,682
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call...

204
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,547
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call...

205
00:36:09,538 --> 00:36:12,098
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya.

206
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,500
Look what the satellite picked up.

207
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,536
We found a match:
your missing Tiger.

208
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:22,848
In the middle of Northern Russia.

209
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,753
It seems your hunch
was right, 007.

210
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:27,674
It's too bad the evil Queen of Numbers
wouldn't let you play it.

211
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:34,964
- You were saying?
- No, I was just...

212
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:39,044
Good. Because if I want sarcasm,
Mr. Tanner, I'll talk to my children.

213
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,607
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

214
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:45,961
The Prime Minister's
waiting for an update.

215
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,916
Proceed with your briefing,
Mr. Tanner.

216
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:50,299
Thank you.

217
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,027
After the distress signal,
your helicopter took off...

218
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:57,541
and the Russians scrambled
these three MIGs here to intercept it.

219
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,066
What do you think the Russians
are using the base for?

220
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:02,867
Well, at one point we suspected
Severnaya might be the ground station...

221
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:06,686
for a secret space-based weapons program
called GoldenEye, but...

222
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:08,528
Our statistical analysis
saw they had...

223
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:10,778
neither the finance
nor technology to implement it.

224
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:13,086
Numbers were never
my strong suit.

225
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:15,937
Are these pictures live?

226
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,719
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

227
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:45,634
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

228
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:47,899
What the bloody hell was that?

229
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:13,484
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

230
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:18,659
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

231
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,818
Boris!

232
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:31,988
Boris!

233
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,696
Thanks.

234
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:35,631
Our satellite is knocked out.

235
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:38,245
So are two of the Americans.

236
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:43,333
We have another
coming into range...

237
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,666
now.

238
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:48,857
Good God.

239
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,559
Two of the MIGs are down.

240
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:55,275
And it looks like
the third went into the dish.

241
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,201
What do you think?

242
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,982
No lights.

243
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,707
Not one single electric light on
in a 30-mile radius.

244
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:04,378
E.M.P.?

245
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:06,580
- That explains the MIGs and satellites.
- And the blackout.

246
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:08,552
Electromagnetic Pulse:

247
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:11,241
a first-strike satellite weapon
developed by the...

248
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:13,761
The Americans and Soviets
during the Cold War.

249
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:17,563
I've read the brief.
Discovered after Hiroshima.

250
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:20,135
Set off a nuclear device
in the upper atmosphere.

251
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,621
Creates a pulse...

252
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:24,796
a radiation surge that destroys
everything with an electronic circuit.

253
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:27,467
The idea being to knock out
the enemy's communications...

254
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:30,155
before he, she, or they
could retaliate.

255
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:33,663
So, GoldenEye exists.

256
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:35,653
Yes.

257
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:38,115
- Could this be an accident?
- No.

258
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,877
The helicopter.

259
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:42,967
If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

260
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:46,178
Setting off the blast was the ideal way
to wipe out any trace of the crime.

261
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:48,343
The Janus group?

262
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:50,812
It may have been involved
with the helicopter.

263
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:54,569
I know the Russian
failsafe systems.

264
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:56,963
You don't just walk in
and ask for the keys to the bomb.

265
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:59,193
You need the access codes.

266
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:07,852
It had to be an insider.

267
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:17,855
And at least one person
probably knows who it is.

268
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:42,157
Very well, sir.
Thank you. Good night.

269
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,391
The Prime Minister's
talked to Moscow.

270
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:48,744
They're saying it was an accident
during a routine training exercise.

271
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:51,904
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

272
00:43:51,841 --> 00:43:54,002
What else do we know about
the Janus syndicate?

273
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:57,011
Topflight arms dealers,
headquartered in St. Petersburg.

274
00:43:56,961 --> 00:44:00,055
The first outfit to restock
the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

275
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:03,368
The head man's unreliably described.
No photographs.

276
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:06,425
The woman, Onatopp...

277
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:08,667
is our only confirmed contact.

278
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:12,202
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

279
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:15,758
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the...
- I prefer bourbon.

280
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,754
- Ice?
- Yes.

281
00:44:26,017 --> 00:44:28,281
We've pulled the files on
anyone who might have had access...

282
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:31,124
or authority at Severnaya.

283
00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:34,201
The top name on the list is
an old friend of yours, I understand.

284
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:39,127
Ourumov.

285
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:41,605
They made him a General.

286
00:44:41,568 --> 00:44:44,059
He sees himself as
the next Iron Man of Russia.

287
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:47,525
So our political analysts rule him out.
He doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

288
00:44:47,457 --> 00:44:50,483
Are these the same analysts
who said that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

289
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,083
Who said the helicopter
posed no immediate threat...

290
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:56,482
and wasn't worth following?

291
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,761
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

292
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:02,570
You think I'm an accountant...

293
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:05,086
a 'bean counter, ' more interested
in my numbers than your instincts.

294
00:45:05,057 --> 00:45:07,491
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

295
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:11,223
Because I think you're a sexist,
misogynist dinosaur.

296
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:13,264
A relic of the Cold War...

297
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:16,046
whose boyish charms,
though wasted on me, obviously appeal...

298
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:18,731
to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

299
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:21,886
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

300
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:25,591
If you think for one moment I don't have
the balls to send a man out to die...

301
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:27,996
your instincts are dead wrong.

302
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,904
I've no compunction about
sending you to your death.

303
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:34,808
But I won't do it on a whim, even with
your cavalier attitude towards life.

304
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,714
I want you to find GoldenEye.

305
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:44,266
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

306
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:46,525
And if you should come across Ourumov,
guilty or not...

307
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:49,488
I don't want you running off
on some kind of vendetta.

308
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:51,773
Avenging Alec Trevelyan
will not bring him back.

309
00:45:51,745 --> 00:45:54,111
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you.

310
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,207
Don't make it personal.

311
00:45:57,312 --> 00:45:58,745
Never.

312
00:46:01,985 --> 00:46:02,917
Bond.

313
00:46:06,273 --> 00:46:07,535
Come back alive.

314
00:46:47,073 --> 00:46:49,007
Good morning, General Ourumov.

315
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:53,394
Defense Minister Mishkin,
gentlemen.

316
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:56,873
Please deliver your report.

317
00:46:59,712 --> 00:47:02,647
As this Council is aware,
72 hours ago...

318
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:06,119
a secret weapon system code-named
GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.

319
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:08,415
As head of Space Division...

320
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,183
I personally undertook
the investigation.

321
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:15,766
I have concluded this crime
was committed by Siberian separatists...

322
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:18,209
seeking to create
political unrest.

323
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:21,071
Regrettably,
the peaceful work...

324
00:47:21,057 --> 00:47:23,491
and much-needed hard currency
earnings of Severnaya...

325
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:26,482
have been set back
by several years.

326
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,367
Therefore,
I tender my resignation.

327
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:34,922
It seems the Council does not
want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

328
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:38,250
Merely your Ioyal assurance that
there are no other GoldenEye satellites.

329
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:40,202
I can give you that assurance,
Defense Minister.

330
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:43,355
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

331
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:50,523
I was aware only of the one,
Boris Grishenko.

332
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:53,425
There was a girl also
whose body was not among the dead.

333
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:55,606
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova,
a level-two programmer.

334
00:47:56,737 --> 00:47:59,171
I will investigate immediately,
Defense Minister.

335
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:01,434
It would seem presumptuous,
General...

336
00:48:01,408 --> 00:48:04,502
to blame this incident
on Siberian separatists...

337
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:07,850
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

338
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,995
Do you agree?

339
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:13,244
Yes, Defense Minister.

340
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:15,412
Thank you for
bringing it to my attention.

341
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:18,746
That will be all.

342
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:36,498
Morning, Q.
Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

343
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:39,393
Hunting!

344
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:43,883
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

345
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,673
First, your new car, BMW.

346
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:50,583
Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar...

347
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:52,226
self-destruct system...

348
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:55,683
and naturally,
all the usual refinements.

349
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:59,074
Now, this I'm
particularly proud of.

350
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:02,409
Behind the headlights,
Stinger missiles.

351
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:05,601
Excellent. Just the thing for unwinding
after a rough day at the office.

352
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,834
Need I remind you, 007...

353
00:49:07,808 --> 00:49:10,106
that you have a licence to kill...

354
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,140
not to break the traffic laws.

355
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:15,080
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

356
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:17,506
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

357
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:20,237
A typical leather belt.

358
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:23,993
Male, size 34, buckle notch.

359
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:28,791
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

360
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:30,759
Good. A typical leather belt.

361
00:49:30,753 --> 00:49:32,516
Q, I'm familiar with that device.

362
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:37,108
Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord
built into the buckle.

363
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:40,258
Fire, and out shoots a piton...

364
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:43,923
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

365
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:47,208
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

366
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:49,628
It's tested for one, 007.

367
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:56,294
Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.

368
00:49:58,657 --> 00:50:01,751
X-ray document scanner.

369
00:50:01,697 --> 00:50:04,723
A pen.
This is a Class Four grenade.

370
00:50:04,673 --> 00:50:08,302
Three clicks
arms the four-second fuse.

371
00:50:08,224 --> 00:50:10,784
Another three disarms it.

372
00:50:13,696 --> 00:50:16,290
How long did you say the fuse was?

373
00:50:16,256 --> 00:50:18,281
Oh, grow up, 007!

374
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:20,207
They always said the pen
was mightier than the sword.

375
00:50:20,193 --> 00:50:22,855
Thanks to me, they were right.

376
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:26,844
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

377
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:29,085
Here we are.
Sorry about this, Fred.

378
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:31,081
One... two... three.

379
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,926
Don't say it.

380
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:40,846
The writing's on the wall?

381
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,800
Along with the rest of him.

382
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,332
Now, 007, do please try
and return some of...

383
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:53,381
Do please try and return some of
this equipment in pristine order.

384
00:50:53,312 --> 00:50:56,481
Don't touch that!
It's my lunch.

385
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:23,304
In London,
April's a spring month.

386
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:26,266
Oh, yeah?
And what are you, the weatherman?

387
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,972
For crying out loud,
another stiff-assed Brit...

388
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:31,761
with your secret codes
and your passwords.

389
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:34,613
One of these days you guys
are going to learn just to drop it.

390
00:51:34,561 --> 00:51:36,825
Come on, my car's over there.

391
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:53,359
- After you.
- Thank you.

392
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,429
Like you said, drop it.

393
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:00,392
In London,
April's a spring month...

394
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,376
whereas in St. Petersburg
we're freezing our butts off!

395
00:52:02,368 --> 00:52:04,359
Now, is that close enough
for government work?

396
00:52:04,352 --> 00:52:07,378
No. Show me the rose.

397
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,561
Please, no.

398
00:52:09,569 --> 00:52:11,696
All right, all right, all right!

399
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:26,479
- Muffy?
- Third wife.

400
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:29,890
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

401
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:31,883
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

402
00:52:31,873 --> 00:52:33,670
This baby hasn't let me down yet.

403
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:36,189
She's an ugly little bitch,
but she gets you there.

404
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,686
Hey, Bond, you do any gardening?

405
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,814
Hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

406
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:00,981
- What do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

407
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,591
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

408
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:07,448
KGB, military.
Screwdriver.

409
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:13,055
Rumor has it, he lives on one of
those old Soviet missile trains...

410
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,056
that armored stuff they ran around
the country so we couldn't target them.

411
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,053
Want to hand me
that hammer, Jimbo?

412
00:53:20,384 --> 00:53:23,046
No, the bigger one.
The sledge.

413
00:53:23,008 --> 00:53:27,206
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

414
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:30,096
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

415
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:33,540
The best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

416
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:40,399
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy.

417
00:53:40,352 --> 00:53:43,116
A tough mother. Got a limp on
his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

418
00:53:43,072 --> 00:53:46,838
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah. You know him?

419
00:53:46,753 --> 00:53:49,085
I gave him the limp.

420
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:14,190
Yes?

421
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:17,165
Are these all you have?

422
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,054
How many do you want?

423
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:23,061
Twenty-four for the American school,
eleven for the Swedish.

424
00:54:23,008 --> 00:54:25,806
IBM compatible
with 500 meg. Hard drives...

425
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:29,197
CD ROM and 14.4 modems.

426
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,418
- Will you pay dollars?
- Of course.

427
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:33,656
If madame would require
a demonstration, I could...

428
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:37,296
Madame requires one demonstration model
and a quiet place to test it.

429
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:52,773
Natalya.

430
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:09,979
Is everything satisfactory?

431
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:12,182
Everything except the interruption.

432
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:26,952
Now let me get you straight, Jimmy.

433
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:30,972
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

434
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:33,782
And now you want Valentin Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

435
00:55:33,728 --> 00:55:35,195
Yes.

436
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,464
Well, what are you going to do?
Appeal to his heart?

437
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:39,306
No, his wallet.

438
00:55:39,296 --> 00:55:42,732
Oh, that might work.
Okay, show time.

439
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,937
Valentin operates out of
building number 23 there.

440
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,677
Are you sure
you want to do this?

441
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:55,800
Last guy who dropped in uninvited
went home airfreight...

442
00:55:55,745 --> 00:55:57,804
in very small boxes.

443
00:55:58,784 --> 00:56:01,218
Make sure they
send me home first-class.

444
00:56:53,601 --> 00:56:55,831
Natalya, it's me!
It's Boris!

445
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:58,242
It's Boris! It's Boris!
Hello.

446
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:05,659
Another morning shot to hell.

447
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,626
Free market economy.
I swear it will be the end of me.

448
00:57:15,616 --> 00:57:19,108
Walther PPK,
7.65 millimeter.

449
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,735
Only three men I know
use such a gun.

450
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:24,164
I believe I've killed
two of them.

451
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:25,720
Lucky me.

452
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,822
I think not.

453
00:57:51,872 --> 00:57:53,669
James Bond.

454
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,941
Charming, sophisticated
secret agent.

455
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,614
Shaken but not stirred.

456
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,451
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humor, Valentin, huh?

457
00:58:06,368 --> 00:58:09,098
Or your need for an audience.

458
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:10,990
Who's strangling the cat?

459
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,465
Strangling a cat?

460
00:58:18,815 --> 00:58:20,976
That is Irina, my mistress.

461
00:58:22,655 --> 00:58:24,350
A very talented girl.

462
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:28,222
Irina! Take a hike!

463
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:34,370
So, Mr. Bond...

464
00:58:34,368 --> 00:58:37,565
what is it that brings you
to my neighborhood, hmm?

465
00:58:37,504 --> 00:58:39,529
Still working for Ml6...

466
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,182
or have you decided
to join the 21st century?

467
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,974
I hear the new M is a lady.

468
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,451
I want you to do me a favor.

469
00:58:49,887 --> 00:58:52,685
He wants me to do him a favor!

470
00:58:54,143 --> 00:58:56,668
My knee aches...

471
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,736
every single day,
twice as bad when it is cold.

472
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,939
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country, hmm?

473
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:05,362
Tell him, Dimitri!

474
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,674
- Well, it depends...
- Silence!

475
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:11,482
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

476
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:14,486
Someone of your stature must've realized
the skill was not to hit your knee...

477
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:17,162
but to...
miss the rest of you.

478
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,541
So why did you not kill me?

479
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,917
Call it professional courtesy.

480
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:28,451
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

481
00:59:30,623 --> 00:59:32,887
Kirov's funeral parlor,
4:00 this afternoon.

482
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:38,113
Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

483
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:41,505
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged...

484
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,873
their man drives the hearse out.

485
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,604
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

486
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,858
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

487
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,225
Your money.

488
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:55,283
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

489
00:59:55,231 --> 00:59:58,530
I want you to set me up...
with Janus.

490
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,696
What has he done to deserve you?

491
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,224
- Stole a helicopter.
- I have six.

492
01:00:04,192 --> 01:00:06,183
Three. None that fly.

493
01:00:06,176 --> 01:00:07,905
Who's counting?

494
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:10,201
These are not just criminals,
Valentin, they're traitors.

495
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:12,837
They used the chopper
to steal a nuclear weapon.

496
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,768
Killed a lot of
innocent Russians doing it.

497
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,306
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

498
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:22,825
This Janus, I've never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

499
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:26,381
Group that worked for the Nazis
against the Russians, Second World War.

500
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:28,828
You know your history, Mr. Bond.
At the end of the war...

501
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,361
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria...

502
01:00:32,288 --> 01:00:36,622
believing they'd join your government
and wage war against the communists.

503
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:38,445
But, the British betrayed them...

504
01:00:38,431 --> 01:00:42,128
sent them promptly back to Stalin
who promptly had them all shot...

505
01:00:42,048 --> 01:00:44,608
women, children, families.

506
01:00:45,536 --> 01:00:47,401
Not exactly our finest hour.

507
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:52,859
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

508
01:00:52,767 --> 01:00:56,100
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

509
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:58,466
You're going to meet me tonight
at the Grand Hotel Europe.

510
01:00:58,431 --> 01:01:02,162
And then, you and I are even
and he owes me one?

511
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:04,323
Precisely.

512
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,648
You don't need the gun,
Commander.

513
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,856
That depends on your definition
of 'safe sex. '

514
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,593
That's close enough.

515
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,865
Not for what I have in mind.

516
01:02:42,623 --> 01:02:45,421
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

517
01:03:03,807 --> 01:03:06,071
You think you can break me?

518
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,615
Yes! Yes!

519
01:03:15,615 --> 01:03:16,707
Yes!

520
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,221
No, no, no.

521
01:03:25,631 --> 01:03:27,758
No more foreplay.

522
01:03:28,895 --> 01:03:31,022
Take me to Janus.

523
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:47,805
- This is it?
- Yes.

524
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,810
Well, I must say,
I've had a lovely evening. You?

525
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:57,181
Well, once again,
the pleasure was all yours.

526
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:59,085
You'll understand
if I don't call.

527
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:01,539
I won't lose sleep over it.

528
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,603
Sweet dreams.

529
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,599
Hello, James.

530
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,907
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

531
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:45,282
No longer just an anonymous star
on the memorial wall at Ml6.

532
01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:49,198
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark?

533
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:50,850
No pithy comeback?

534
01:05:51,939 --> 01:05:53,201
Why?

535
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:58,666
Hilarious question,
particularly from you.

536
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:01,169
Did you ever ask why?

537
01:06:01,155 --> 01:06:05,216
Why we toppled all those dictators,
undermined all those regimes?

538
01:06:05,123 --> 01:06:08,718
Only to come home: 'Well done, good job.
But sorry, old boy.

539
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:11,476
Everything you risked your life
and limb for has changed. '

540
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:15,262
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

541
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:19,040
James Bond,
Her Majesty's Ioyal terrier...

542
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:21,177
defender of the
so-called 'faith. '

543
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:23,589
Oh, please, James, put it away.

544
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:27,214
It's insulting to think I haven't
anticipated your every move.

545
01:06:30,322 --> 01:06:31,846
Yes.

546
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:36,426
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust?

547
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:39,201
What a quaint idea.

548
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:44,019
How did the Ml6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

549
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:47,689
Once again, your faith is misplaced.
They knew.

550
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:50,162
We're both orphans, James.

551
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,089
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident...

552
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:57,700
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

553
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:02,467
But my father couldn't let himself,
or my mother, live with the shame of it.

554
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:07,511
Ml6 figured I was
too young to remember.

555
01:07:07,443 --> 01:07:10,071
And in one of life's
little ironies...

556
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:13,299
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal...

557
01:07:13,235 --> 01:07:16,500
caused the father
to kill himself and his wife.

558
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:18,494
Hence, Janus.

559
01:07:19,538 --> 01:07:21,938
The two-faced Roman god
come to life.

560
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:25,604
It wasn't God who gave me this face,
it was you...

561
01:07:25,523 --> 01:07:28,458
setting the timers for three minutes
instead of six.

562
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:30,337
Am I supposed
to feel sorry for you?

563
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:33,690
No. You're supposed
to die for me.

564
01:07:36,403 --> 01:07:38,132
Oh, by the way...

565
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,099
I did think of asking you
to join my little scheme...

566
01:07:41,043 --> 01:07:43,603
but somehow I knew...

567
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:48,565
007's Ioyalty was always to the mission,
never to his friend.

568
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:53,506
Closing time, James.
Last call.

569
01:08:07,987 --> 01:08:09,682
For England, James.

570
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:11,773
Wake up!

571
01:08:11,763 --> 01:08:13,196
Mister!

572
01:08:14,419 --> 01:08:16,546
Wake up, please!

573
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,623
- Wake up!
- I'm here.

574
01:08:18,611 --> 01:08:20,943
- I'm here!
- Hurry!

575
01:08:20,915 --> 01:08:23,383
Hurry up! Come out!

576
01:08:23,347 --> 01:08:25,315
Pull yourself together!
We're going to die!

577
01:08:28,435 --> 01:08:30,665
Do something!
Get us out of here!

578
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:33,976
I'm a little tied up...
Never mind.

579
01:09:49,138 --> 01:09:52,039
The things that we do
for 'frequent flyer' mileage.

580
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:56,193
Here, let me help you.

581
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:58,169
That's it, mind your head.

582
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:08,421
Let me go!

583
01:10:50,418 --> 01:10:52,352
Who are you?

584
01:10:53,746 --> 01:10:56,738
Listen, I'm on your side.
I'm here to help you.

585
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,123
- I don't know anything.
- I don't believe you.

586
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,064
- I don't care what you believe.
- Look!

587
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:03,110
They might be back for us any minute.
You either take your chances with me...

588
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,322
or your fellow countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya.

589
01:11:05,298 --> 01:11:08,165
I've never been to Severnaya.

590
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:12,380
Your watch has.
Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.

591
01:11:12,273 --> 01:11:15,470
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

592
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,958
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

593
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:22,413
And the more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

594
01:11:22,386 --> 01:11:25,844
- But I don't know anything!
- Then let's start with what you do know.

595
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,755
My name is Natalya Simonova.

596
01:11:39,026 --> 01:11:42,621
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

597
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:44,241
Go on.

598
01:11:45,746 --> 01:11:48,977
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

599
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:50,848
No. I don't know who that is.

600
01:11:50,834 --> 01:11:53,496
Who was the insider?
Who was the traitor?

601
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,790
Boris.
Boris Grishenko.

602
01:11:55,762 --> 01:11:59,755
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

603
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:02,897
- There was no one else?
- No.

604
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,393
They're going to kill me,
aren't they?

605
01:12:08,018 --> 01:12:09,451
Trust me.

606
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:15,660
Trust you?
I don't even know your name.

607
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:19,151
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

608
01:12:19,121 --> 01:12:20,554
Sit.

609
01:12:26,962 --> 01:12:29,590
I'm Defense Minister
Dimitri Mishkin.

610
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:32,853
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

611
01:12:32,786 --> 01:12:34,879
What, no small talk?

612
01:12:34,866 --> 01:12:38,461
No chitchat?
That's the trouble with the world today.

613
01:12:38,386 --> 01:12:42,982
No one takes the time to do a sinister
interrogation anymore. It's a lost art.

614
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:45,767
Your sense of humor doesn't slay me,
Commander. I'm sorry.

615
01:12:45,714 --> 01:12:47,944
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

616
01:12:47,921 --> 01:12:51,584
I have an English spy, a Severnaya
programmer and the helicopter they took.

617
01:12:51,506 --> 01:12:53,406
That's what some traitor in your
government wanted it to look like.

618
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:56,124
- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?
- Who had the authorization codes?

619
01:12:56,082 --> 01:12:58,710
Russia may have changed, but the
penalty for terrorism is still death!

620
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:02,872
- And what's the penalty for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it!

621
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,705
You're like boys with toys.

622
01:13:09,906 --> 01:13:13,398
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

623
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,594
I saw him do it.

624
01:13:16,754 --> 01:13:19,279
Are you certain it was Ourumov?

625
01:13:19,249 --> 01:13:23,447
Yes. He killed everyone
and stole the GoldenEye.

626
01:13:25,202 --> 01:13:27,102
And why would he do that?

627
01:13:28,306 --> 01:13:30,706
There is another satellite.

628
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,552
Another GoldenEye?

629
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:38,368
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

630
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:43,097
You were saying something about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

631
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:47,025
Defense Minister, I must protest!

632
01:13:46,993 --> 01:13:49,928
This is my investigation.
You are out of order.

633
01:13:51,602 --> 01:13:54,435
From what I am hearing,
it is you who's out of order!

634
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:57,331
- I have seen this gun before.
- Put it down.

635
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,093
- In the hand of our enemy.
- Put it down, General!

636
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:02,116
Do you even know who
the enemy is, Dimitri?

637
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:03,727
- Do you?
- Guard!

638
01:14:09,618 --> 01:14:12,678
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...

639
01:14:13,778 --> 01:14:17,646
murdered by a British agent,
James Bond.

640
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:24,078
Himself shot while
trying to escape. Guards!

641
01:14:35,378 --> 01:14:36,811
Come on!

642
01:15:15,569 --> 01:15:17,127
They're in the archives!

643
01:15:21,937 --> 01:15:23,564
Down!

644
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,460
Spread out!
Cover the other side!

645
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,002
Trust me.

646
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,540
Go now!

647
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,043
Faster!

648
01:17:43,634 --> 01:17:44,726
Damn it!

649
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,935
Down the alley!

650
01:18:50,705 --> 01:18:53,469
Use the bumper!
That's what it's for!

651
01:20:25,744 --> 01:20:27,541
What was that?

652
01:21:02,448 --> 01:21:03,710
Go left!

653
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,815
Get out!

654
01:22:35,568 --> 01:22:38,799
Either you've brought me
the perfect gift, General Ourumov...

655
01:22:38,736 --> 01:22:40,727
or you've made me
a very unhappy man.

656
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,188
Mishkin got to them
before I could.

657
01:22:44,496 --> 01:22:47,056
Bond is alive?

658
01:22:47,024 --> 01:22:48,457
He escaped.

659
01:22:48,465 --> 01:22:51,730
Good for Bond.
Bad for you.

660
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:57,063
Take a seat, my dear.

661
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:16,178
You know, James and I
shared everything.

662
01:23:18,608 --> 01:23:20,701
Absolutely everything.

663
01:23:24,976 --> 01:23:26,910
To the victor go the spoils.

664
01:23:36,272 --> 01:23:37,933
You'll like it where we're going.

665
01:23:44,304 --> 01:23:46,738
You may even learn to like me.

666
01:23:55,824 --> 01:23:57,587
Stay with her.

667
01:24:03,312 --> 01:24:04,404
Bond.

668
01:24:04,432 --> 01:24:06,696
Only Bond.

669
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:08,867
He's going to derail us.

670
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:10,836
Full speed!

671
01:24:12,176 --> 01:24:13,768
Full speed! Ram him!

672
01:25:16,432 --> 01:25:18,866
Why can't you just be
a good boy and die?

673
01:25:18,832 --> 01:25:20,993
You first.

674
01:25:20,976 --> 01:25:23,968
You... second.

675
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,251
Up!

676
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,407
Situation analysis: hopeless.

677
01:25:33,296 --> 01:25:36,697
You have no backup,
no escape route.

678
01:25:36,624 --> 01:25:39,286
And I have the only
bargaining chip.

679
01:25:39,248 --> 01:25:40,909
Where is she?

680
01:25:40,912 --> 01:25:43,972
Oh, yes.
Your fatal weakness.

681
01:25:45,136 --> 01:25:47,366
Ourumov, bring her in.

682
01:25:49,264 --> 01:25:51,255
Lovely girl.

683
01:25:51,248 --> 01:25:54,775
Tastes like...
like strawberries.

684
01:25:54,704 --> 01:25:56,672
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

685
01:26:04,912 --> 01:26:06,777
So, back where we started, James.

686
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:10,522
Your friend or the mission.

687
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,108
Drop the gun.
I'll let her live.

688
01:26:16,528 --> 01:26:20,794
Ourumov, what has this
Cossack promised you?

689
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,333
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

690
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:28,461
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you!

691
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,699
- Just like everyone else.
- Is this true?

692
01:26:31,632 --> 01:26:36,399
What's true is that in 48 hours
you and I will have more money than God.

693
01:26:36,272 --> 01:26:38,740
And Mr. Bond here will have
a small memorial service...

694
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:43,220
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

695
01:26:45,008 --> 01:26:48,375
So, what's the choice, James?

696
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:52,468
Two targets.
Time enough for one shot.

697
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:54,302
The girl, or the mission?

698
01:26:54,288 --> 01:26:57,451
Kill her.
She means nothing to me.

699
01:27:00,496 --> 01:27:02,862
See you in hell, James.

700
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,653
One-inch armor plating.

701
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,005
I'm fine,
thank you very much!

702
01:27:21,808 --> 01:27:25,335
- Boris, yes!
- What are you doing?

703
01:27:25,264 --> 01:27:27,630
Boris is on-line,
backing up his files.

704
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,467
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

705
01:27:33,008 --> 01:27:35,272
But don't stand there!
Get us out of here!

706
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:37,300
Yes, sir.

707
01:27:54,448 --> 01:27:56,882
Good luck with the floor, James.

708
01:27:56,848 --> 01:28:00,579
I set the timers for six minutes...
the same six minutes you gave me.

709
01:28:01,424 --> 01:28:03,915
It was the least
I could do for a friend.

710
01:28:05,712 --> 01:28:09,170
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

711
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,631
What else do you call your butt?

712
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,801
- What?
- It's Boris' password.

713
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:47,775
He plays word games: 'What I sit on,
but I don't take it with me. '

714
01:28:47,728 --> 01:28:50,663
- Chair.
- Like I said.

715
01:28:54,672 --> 01:28:56,105
Thirty seconds.

716
01:28:56,112 --> 01:28:59,479
He's not in Russia, Germany,
Paris, London, Madrid.

717
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:00,841
Twenty-five seconds.

718
01:29:00,847 --> 01:29:03,008
New York, Toronto, Chicago,
San Francisco.

719
01:29:02,992 --> 01:29:04,516
Twenty seconds!

720
01:29:04,528 --> 01:29:06,723
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.

721
01:29:11,759 --> 01:29:13,624
- Come on!
- Wait!

722
01:29:13,616 --> 01:29:16,084
He's in Cuba, Havana. No.

723
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,191
Now!

724
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,692
Do you destroy every vehicle
you get into?

725
01:29:40,624 --> 01:29:42,751
Standard operating procedure.

726
01:29:44,368 --> 01:29:46,598
'Boys with toys. '

727
01:29:49,232 --> 01:29:52,998
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

728
01:29:54,096 --> 01:29:55,563
Our trip?

729
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:58,058
Do you know how
to disarm the weapon?

730
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:04,269
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

731
01:30:05,904 --> 01:30:09,101
So, tell me.

732
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,373
Are there any other
standard operating procedures...

733
01:30:12,304 --> 01:30:15,239
I should be aware of, Commander?

734
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,625
Thousands.

735
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:24,551
But I only pay them...

736
01:30:24,496 --> 01:30:26,327
lip service.

737
01:30:48,496 --> 01:30:52,193
My whole life, I dreamed about
coming to the Caribbean.

738
01:30:52,111 --> 01:30:54,204
It's so beautiful.

739
01:30:54,192 --> 01:30:56,717
Not another human being in sight.

740
01:31:08,687 --> 01:31:11,679
What is it with you
and moving vehicles?

741
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:37,026
Yo, Jimbo!

742
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:40,566
Brought a little gift from
old what's-his-name, uh, T, Z...?

743
01:31:40,496 --> 01:31:42,191
- Q.
- Yeah.

744
01:31:42,191 --> 01:31:45,786
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

745
01:31:45,712 --> 01:31:47,339
I am not here.

746
01:31:47,343 --> 01:31:50,369
The CIA has no knowledge, no
involvement, absolutely nothing to do...

747
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:52,719
with your insertion into Cuba,
if you catch my drift.

748
01:31:52,687 --> 01:31:54,917
Yes, I do, perfectly.

749
01:31:54,896 --> 01:31:57,126
Borrowed the plane from
a friend of mine in the DEA.

750
01:31:57,104 --> 01:31:59,766
Now, the Coast Guard
and the FAA are both in the loop.

751
01:31:59,728 --> 01:32:02,561
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

752
01:32:02,512 --> 01:32:04,844
Here's the latest Sat-Int
from Langley.

753
01:32:04,815 --> 01:32:08,774
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

754
01:32:08,688 --> 01:32:11,020
- Who's that?
- Natalya Siminova.

755
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:12,424
Natalya Simonova.

756
01:32:12,432 --> 01:32:14,627
Russian Minister of Transportation.

757
01:32:17,103 --> 01:32:19,697
Did you check her out?

758
01:32:19,664 --> 01:32:22,189
- Head to toe.
- Right.

759
01:32:23,952 --> 01:32:27,046
So, you're looking for a dish
the size of a football field, huh?

760
01:32:26,992 --> 01:32:30,519
Doesn't exist. You can't light a cigar
in Cuba without us seeing it.

761
01:32:30,447 --> 01:32:31,812
I know it's there.

762
01:32:31,824 --> 01:32:34,884
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like your
secret transmitters in New Zealand.

763
01:32:36,303 --> 01:32:38,794
I've never been to New Zealand.
How'd she know about that?

764
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:40,029
What if I need backup?

765
01:32:40,047 --> 01:32:42,311
Get on the radio.
I'll send in the Marines.

766
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,585
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

767
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:49,010
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

768
01:32:53,071 --> 01:32:56,165
Just one thing: Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

769
01:32:56,111 --> 01:32:59,979
- I was going to go bombing around in it.
- Exactly.

770
01:32:59,887 --> 01:33:04,290
Yo, James, I got faith.
But be careful. He knows you're coming.

771
01:34:06,416 --> 01:34:08,941
He was your friend, Trevelyan?

772
01:34:10,799 --> 01:34:13,791
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

773
01:34:15,535 --> 01:34:18,698
It is that simple?

774
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,541
In a word, yes.

775
01:34:21,487 --> 01:34:23,614
Unless he kills you first.

776
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,795
- Natalya...
- You think I'm impressed?

777
01:34:25,776 --> 01:34:29,109
All of you with your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

778
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,564
So you can be a hero?

779
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,017
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya, listen to me.

780
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:38,119
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

781
01:34:39,951 --> 01:34:42,215
It's what keeps me alive.

782
01:34:43,696 --> 01:34:44,628
No.

783
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:47,421
It's what keeps you alone.

784
01:35:24,592 --> 01:35:26,025
James?

785
01:35:28,047 --> 01:35:29,480
Yes?

786
01:35:36,175 --> 01:35:39,269
On the train...

787
01:35:39,215 --> 01:35:43,709
when you told him to kill me
and I meant nothing to you...

788
01:35:43,599 --> 01:35:45,533
did you mean it?

789
01:35:47,472 --> 01:35:48,996
Yes.

790
01:35:49,967 --> 01:35:53,528
Basic rule:
always call their bluff.

791
01:35:57,711 --> 01:35:59,144
No.

792
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:35,189
Turn ten degrees south,
bearing one-eight-four.

793
01:36:35,087 --> 01:36:36,748
Yes, sir.

794
01:37:00,592 --> 01:37:03,390
Nothing.
There is nothing here.

795
01:37:04,528 --> 01:37:06,621
Let's make another pass.

796
01:37:18,511 --> 01:37:21,275
Maybe Wade was right.
There is no dish.

797
01:38:17,488 --> 01:38:19,080
Natalya.

798
01:39:16,912 --> 01:39:21,747
This time, Mr. Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

799
01:39:39,759 --> 01:39:41,750
Wait for your turn.

800
01:40:14,415 --> 01:40:16,592
She always did enjoy
a good squeeze.

801
01:40:26,992 --> 01:40:29,654
Is the satellite in range?

802
01:40:29,616 --> 01:40:31,641
- Six minutes.
- Prepare the dish.

803
01:40:31,631 --> 01:40:35,533
No! It's too early.
I am not ready.

804
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:36,997
Do it!

805
01:41:06,031 --> 01:41:07,726
No wonder we couldn't see it.

806
01:41:18,128 --> 01:41:19,720
Come on.

807
01:41:34,735 --> 01:41:37,431
The world's greatest cash card.

808
01:41:38,735 --> 01:41:40,760
It had better not be rejected.

809
01:42:42,512 --> 01:42:45,504
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.

810
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:52,696
Kill him!

811
01:42:52,687 --> 01:42:54,780
The man just won't take a hint.

812
01:42:56,175 --> 01:43:00,134
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

813
01:43:12,272 --> 01:43:14,900
He's getting ready
to signal the satellite.

814
01:43:14,863 --> 01:43:17,855
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna...

815
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:50,274
Antenna in position.

816
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:55,073
On my count.

817
01:43:56,175 --> 01:43:59,076
Three... two... one.

818
01:44:27,055 --> 01:44:29,080
God save the Queen.

819
01:44:47,151 --> 01:44:49,142
The mainframe computer.

820
01:44:49,135 --> 01:44:50,397
Don't move.

821
01:46:13,391 --> 01:46:16,485
James!
What an unpleasant surprise.

822
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:18,524
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?

823
01:46:19,759 --> 01:46:20,817
Find her!

824
01:46:28,943 --> 01:46:31,673
So, how is old Q?

825
01:46:31,631 --> 01:46:33,826
Up to his usual tricks?

826
01:46:33,807 --> 01:46:35,399
The watch.

827
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:42,550
A new model.

828
01:46:42,543 --> 01:46:44,943
Still press here, do I?

829
01:47:00,559 --> 01:47:03,119
Interesting setup, Alec.

830
01:47:03,087 --> 01:47:06,420
You break into the Bank of England
via computer...

831
01:47:06,351 --> 01:47:09,081
and then transfer
the money electronically...

832
01:47:09,038 --> 01:47:11,802
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye...

833
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:14,887
which erases any record
of the transactions.

834
01:47:15,823 --> 01:47:18,656
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

835
01:47:18,607 --> 01:47:21,599
But it still boils down
to petty theft.

836
01:47:22,543 --> 01:47:25,103
In the end,
you're just a bank robber.

837
01:47:25,071 --> 01:47:27,835
Nothing more
than a common thief.

838
01:47:36,878 --> 01:47:39,711
You always did have
a small mind, James.

839
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:41,721
It's not just
erasing bank records.

840
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:44,475
It's everything on every computer
in Greater London:

841
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:48,891
tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries...

842
01:47:48,783 --> 01:47:51,581
criminal records.

843
01:47:51,534 --> 01:47:54,162
In 16 minutes and 43 sec...

844
01:47:54,127 --> 01:47:58,120
No, 42 seconds... the United Kingdom
will reenter the Stone Age.

845
01:47:58,031 --> 01:48:00,556
A worldwide financial meltdown.

846
01:48:00,526 --> 01:48:05,554
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

847
01:48:05,423 --> 01:48:08,984
Oh, please, James.
Spare me the Freud.

848
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:12,210
I might as well ask you if all the vodka
martinis ever silence the screams...

849
01:48:12,143 --> 01:48:13,974
of all the men you've killed.

850
01:48:17,135 --> 01:48:20,366
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms
of all those willing women...

851
01:48:20,303 --> 01:48:23,431
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

852
01:48:25,327 --> 01:48:28,785
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal...

853
01:48:28,718 --> 01:48:31,619
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

854
01:48:33,903 --> 01:48:36,736
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya!

855
01:49:09,935 --> 01:49:13,393
Don't ever do that again!

856
01:49:13,327 --> 01:49:15,454
This is not one of
your games, Boris.

857
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:18,931
Real people will die!
You pathetic little worm.

858
01:49:20,623 --> 01:49:22,955
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

859
01:49:22,927 --> 01:49:27,125
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

860
01:49:27,023 --> 01:49:30,857
She works on
the guidance system.

861
01:49:30,766 --> 01:49:34,361
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

862
01:49:37,711 --> 01:49:39,975
Retrorockets firing!

863
01:49:56,911 --> 01:49:58,936
What the hell's happening?

864
01:49:58,927 --> 01:50:02,761
We will have reentry in...
12 minutes!

865
01:50:04,847 --> 01:50:07,509
- It will burn up over the Atlantic.
- Deal with it!

866
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:10,803
She changed the access codes!

867
01:50:11,663 --> 01:50:13,597
Well, then she can fix it.

868
01:50:16,975 --> 01:50:20,706
Go ahead, shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

869
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:23,268
I can do it!

870
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:25,611
- I can break her codes.
- Then get on with it!

871
01:50:53,519 --> 01:50:55,043
Tell him, now!

872
01:50:56,527 --> 01:51:00,224
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!

873
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:17,938
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

874
01:51:17,903 --> 01:51:19,336
Possibly?

875
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:22,765
We have to destroy
the transmitter.

876
01:51:22,734 --> 01:51:26,602
By the way,
I'm fine, thank you very much.

877
01:51:53,071 --> 01:51:54,936
Do you know how
to use one of these?

878
01:51:57,966 --> 01:51:59,593
Yes.

879
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:01,829
Good.
Stay out of sight.

880
01:52:16,015 --> 01:52:18,415
- How long?
- Two minutes. One minute.

881
01:52:18,383 --> 01:52:20,578
- Guard!
- I'm fixing it!

882
01:52:21,519 --> 01:52:24,010
If he moves, kill him.

883
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:45,673
Yes! I am invincible!

884
01:55:50,829 --> 01:55:54,993
You know, James...
I was always better.

885
01:56:11,917 --> 01:56:13,350
Alpha One to Gunship.

886
01:56:14,381 --> 01:56:16,849
Alpha One to Gunship!

887
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:16,726
Speak to me!

888
01:57:50,125 --> 01:57:52,423
For England, James?

889
01:57:52,973 --> 01:57:55,237
No.

890
01:57:55,213 --> 01:57:56,646
For me.

891
01:59:12,589 --> 01:59:15,114
Yes! I am invincible!

892
01:59:38,829 --> 01:59:41,263
James! James!

893
01:59:41,229 --> 01:59:43,163
Are you all right?

894
01:59:46,221 --> 01:59:48,314
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

895
01:59:57,901 --> 02:00:00,927
Suppose someone is watching?

896
02:00:00,877 --> 02:00:04,108
No. There's no one
within 25 miles, believe me.

897
02:00:05,005 --> 02:00:06,438
Yo, Jimbo!

898
02:00:15,789 --> 02:00:19,850
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh,
coming through in a clinch?

899
02:00:21,421 --> 02:00:25,357
It's tobacco plants.
I said I'd be here, huh?

900
02:00:25,261 --> 02:00:27,252
Yo! Marines!

901
02:00:37,453 --> 02:00:40,204
Maybe you two would like to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

902
02:00:40,204 --> 02:00:41,171
Maybe you two would like to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

903
02:00:43,564 --> 02:00:45,794
- You ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

904
02:00:45,771 --> 02:00:49,036
No plane, no train,
nothing that moves.

905
02:00:48,972 --> 02:00:52,203
Darling, what could
possible go wrong, eh?
