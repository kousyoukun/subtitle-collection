比你预想的要经常多了

詹姆斯，你真是无药可救
James, you're incorrigible.

57
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,190
我拿你没辙

好了，为你的评估干杯好吗？

那是我的座右铭
The very words I live by.

78

你的座右铭是什么?
And what words do you live by?

79
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,420
见机行事，见好就收
The trick is to quit while you're still ahead.

这本事我可学不来，不如你教我别的
That's one trick I've never learned. Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

- 波洛 - 什么？
- Boris! - What?

144
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,220
我记得我不是登在网路上了吗？
I thought I'd post it on the Internet, no?

145
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,890
- 密码是什么？ - 这次我写个简单的
- What's the password? - I made it easy this time.

146
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,130
就连你都能破译，真是笨蛋一个
Even you should be able to break it, borscht for brains.

147
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,800
好吧，给你个提示
All right, all right, I'll give you a hint.

148
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,310
就在你眼前可以打开很大的门
They're right in front of you and can open very large doors.

149
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,040
密码门环，你真讨厌
You're such a geek.

150
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,650
好棒，我进入了
Yes, I'm in!

151
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,790
你已经闯入了美国司法部
You've hacked into the U.S. Department of Justice.

152
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,860
知道被追查到的后果吗？
Do you know what will happen if they trace it here?

153
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,560
电脑部主任会把我当天才
The Chief of Computers will call me a genius...

154
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,970
...调我到莫斯科，给我一百万元
move me to Moscow and give me a million bucks hard currency.

155
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,500
才怪
I think not.

156
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:54,200
不过，美国人很笨，绝对查不到我的
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads. They'll never detect me.

157
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,050
- 你说他们很笨？ - 没人敢惹我葛波洛
- You were saying, slug-head? - Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!

158
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,790
破坏他们
Spiked them!

159
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,950
快挂断
Come on, Boris, just hang up.

160
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,750
才不，我破坏他们了
No way! I spiked them!

161
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,490
好啦，密码是什么？
All right, what's the password?

162
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,620
我不告诉你
I'm not going to tell you.

163
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,570
让我猜猜
Okay, let me guess.

164
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,260
不是在我前面吗？
It's not in front of me?

165
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,070
你能坐在上面却不能带走
You sit on it, but you can't take it with you.

166
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,210
我的程式能够拦截任何追踪我的电话
My program seizes the phone line of whoever's tracing me...

167
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,550
干扰数据机，他们无法挂断
and jams their modem so they can't hang up.

168
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,410
现在猎物变成猎人了
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

169
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,350
(联邦调查局电脑诈欺部)

170
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,120
祝你下次好运
Better luck next time...

171
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,960
笨蛋
slug-heads!

172
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,170
成功了
Bang! Gone!

173
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,430
我所向无敌
I am invincible!

174
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,570
你不是也过瘾吗？
Was it good for you, too?

175
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,310
我去喝咖啡
I'm getting some coffee.

176
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,320
我去抽一支烟
I'm going for a cigarette.

177
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,780
阿凯蒂・巫洛莫将军
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...

178
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,410
太空部负责人
head of Space Division.

179
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,860
- 将军，若我知道... - 你应该已经准备就绪
- General, if I'd known... - You'd have been ready.

180
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,340
这是临时战争模拟试验
This is an unscheduled test of the Severnaya facility. War simulation.

181
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,640
我们要试发黄金眼，请报告
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye. Report your status.

182
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,370
两枚卫星，将军
Two operational satellites, sir: Petya and Mischa...

183
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,470
以九十分钟一百公里的速度运行
both in 90-minute earth orbit at 100 kilometers.

184
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,520
很好，这是授权密码
Good. Here is the authorization code.

185
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,580
黄金眼和今天的卫星操作序号
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access numbers for satellite Petya, please.

186
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,720
我在计时
I am timing you.

187
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,380
很好，谢谢你
Good. Thank you, Major.

188
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,820
倒数
On my count.

189
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,130
三...二...一
Three... two... one.

190
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,840
设定目标，塞维亚
Set target: Severnaya.

191
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,450
准备武器
Arm the weapon.

192
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,740
确认下
Check it!

193
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,020
救援最快19分钟才能来，他们会晚到的
Their best response time is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

194
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,000
没事了，我得清理掉一个人
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

195
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,840
- 晚安，钱班霓 - 晚安，詹姆斯
- Good evening, Moneypenny. - Good evening, James.

196
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,180
M在军情室，我带你进去
M will meet you in the situation room. I'm to take you straight in.

197
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,650
我从来没有下班后见过你，真漂亮
I've never seen you after hours, Moneypenny. Lovely.

198
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,020
- 谢谢夸奖，詹姆斯 - 有特别任务吗？
- Thank you, James. - Out on a professional assignment?

199
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,550
要去迷倒众生？
Dressing to kill?

200
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,250
我知道你很失望，007
I know you'll find this crushing, 007...

201
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,950
我不是坐在家里为国际事件祈祷...
but I don't sit at home every night praying for an international incident...

202
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,690
所以我盛装赶来让詹姆斯邦德开眼
so I can run down here all dressed up to impress James Bond.

203
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,000
我跟一位绅士有约，一起去看戏
I was on a date with a gentleman. We went to the theater together.

204
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,630
钱班霓，我好伤心
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

205
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,170
失去你，我怎么办？
What would I ever do without you?

206
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,800
就我的记忆里，詹姆斯，你从没得到过我
As far as I can remember, James, you've never had me.

207
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,010
有希望才有无限春梦
Hope springs eternal.

208
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,640
你知道，这种行为算是性骚扰
You know, this sort of behavior could qualify as sexual harassment.

209
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,250
真的吗？该怎么罚？
Really? What's the penalty for that?

210
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,290
总有一天你得实现你的讽刺话
Someday you have to make good on your innuendos.

211
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,990
- 你先请，钱班霓 - 不，我坚持...
- After you, Moneypenny. - No, I insist.

212
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,660
还是你先请
You first

213
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,000
- 你好，007 - 丹诺，什么事？
- Good evening, 007. - Tanner. What's up?

214
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,670
我们截获了一个遇险信号
Sixteen minutes ago, we intercepted a distress call...

215
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,210
来自塞维亚废弃的雷达站
from a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya.

216
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,720
看看卫星拍的照片
Look what the satellite picked up.

217
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,980
我们找到了失踪的“猛虎”直升机
We found a match: your missing Tiger.

218
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,420
在北俄罗斯中部吗？
In the middle of Northern Russia.

219
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,430
你猜的没错，007
It seems your hunch was right, 007.

220
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,430
可惜你的邪恶女上司不让你玩
It's too bad the evil Queen of Numbers wouldn't let you play it.

221
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,030
- 你说的是？ - 没有，我只是...
- You were saying? - No, I was just...

222
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,240
很好，如我想听挖苦的话找我的孩子就行了，多谢
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, Mr. Tanner, I'll talk to my children.

223
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,040
- 晚安，007 - 晚安，M
- Good evening, 007. - Good evening, M.

224
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,480
首相在等最新报告
The Prime Minister's waiting for an update.

225
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,580
请开始简报，丹诺先生
Proceed with your briefing, Mr. Tanner.

226
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,090
谢谢
Thank you.

227
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,920
求救讯号后直升机就起飞
After the distress signal, your helicopter took off...

228
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,590
俄军派三架米格机拦截
and the Russians scrambled these three MIGs here to intercept it.

229
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,220
俄国人用这基地做什么？
What do you think the Russians are using the base for?

230
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,130
目前我们怀疑那也许是...
Well, at one point we suspected Severnaya might be the ground station...

231
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,070
...秘密太空武器“黄金眼”计划的基地
for a secret space-based weapons program called GoldenEye, but

232
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,070
我们的分析显示对方既无财力...
Our statistical analysis saw they had...

233
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,410
也无技术力量运作
neither the finance nor technology to implement it.

234
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,810
我毫无数字观念
Numbers were never my strong suit.

235
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,810
这些图片是立即传送的？
Are these pictures live?

236
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,710
我们和美国政府不一样，不喜欢从CNN上得到坏消息
Unlike the American government, we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

237
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,770
目前并无异状，一切正常
Negative so far. Everything seems normal.

238
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,710
这到底是怎么搞的？
What the bloody hell was that?

239
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,920
娜坦雅・席蒙娜
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

240
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,300
娜坦雅・席蒙娜
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

241
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,550
波洛
Boris!

242
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,810
波洛
Boris!

243
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,580
谢谢
Thanks

244
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,580
我们的卫星被破坏了
Our satellite is knocked out

245
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,280
另外两枚美国的也是
So are two of the Americans.

246
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,520
我们还有另一枚正在进入轨道
We have another coming into range...

247
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,030
现在正在传送影像
now.

248
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,390
老天
Good God.

249
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,240
两架米格机坠毁
Two of the MIGs are down.

250
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,030
第三架撞到卫星天线
And it looks like the third went into the dish.

251
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,070
你觉得如何？
What do you think?

252
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,940
没有灯光
No lights.

253
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,740
方圆三十里内全部停电
Not one single electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

254
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,580
电磁波？
E.M.P.?

255
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,840
- 会引起米格机和卫星天线被毁 - 还有停电？
- That explains the MIGs and satellites. - And the blackout

256
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,920
电磁波
Electromagnetic Pulse:

257
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,680
是一项美苏两国在冷战中...
a first-strike satellite weapon developed by the...

258
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,320
研发的攻击性卫星
The Americans and Soviets during the Cold War.

259
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,230
我看过简报，广岛核爆后发现的
I've read the brief. Discovered after Hiroshima.

260
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,960
在高层大气进行核爆
Set off a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

261
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,560
会产生激波
Creates a pulse...

262
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,800
极具毁灭性的辐射电流
a radiation surge that destroys everything with an electronic circuit.

263
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,600
在敌方反击前
The idea being to knock out the enemy's communications...

264
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,400
中断对方通讯
before he, she, or they could retaliate.

265
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,080
所以黄金眼确实存在
So, GoldenEye exists.

266
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,210
没错
Yes.

267
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,720
- 这是意外吗？ - 不是
- Could this be an accident? - No.

268
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,580
因为直升机遭窃
The helicopter.

269
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,750
那是运送黄金眼的最好工具
If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye, it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

270
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,090
把基地炸掉就能毁灭证据
Setting off the blast was the ideal way to wipe out any trace of the crime.

271
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,390
亚努一伙？
The Janus group?

272
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,960
可能跟直升机有关
It may have been involved with the helicopter.

273
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,860
我知道俄国的安全措拖
I know the Russian failsafe systems.

274
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,370
你不能随便进去取得炸弹的钥匙
You don't just walk in and ask for the keys to the bomb.

275
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,700
必须要有密码
You need the access codes.

276
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,740
一定是有内贼
It had to be an insider.

277
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,160
至少有一个人知道是谁

278
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,450
非常好，谢谢，晚安
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

279
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,890
首相与莫斯科联络过
The Prime Minister's talked to Moscow.

280
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:42,320
他们说例行演习出了意外
They're saying it was an accident during a routine training exercise.

281
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,620
换了政府还是照样说谎
Governments change. The lies stay the same.

282
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,860
亚努帮有线索吗？
What else do we know about the Janus syndicate?

283
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,960
军火商大本营在圣彼得堡
Topflight arms dealers, headquartered in St. petersburg.

00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,130
波斯湾战争中提供伊拉克军火
The first outfit to restock the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

285
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,570
首脑身份不明，没有照片
The head man's unreliably described. No photographs.

286
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,770
那女人...安娜拓
The woman, Onatopp...

287
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,140
...是唯一的线索
is our only confirmed contact.

288
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,770
- 你要来杯酒吗？ - 谢谢
- Would you care for a drink? - Thank you.

289
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,480
- 你的前任留下的干邑酒在上面... - 我喜欢波本酒
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the... - I prefer bourbon.

290
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,650
- 加冰吗？ - 好的
- Ice? - Yes.

291
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,590
我们已经调阅了在塞维亚每个能获得
We've pulled the files on anyone who might have had access..

292
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,530
使用密码的人的档案
or authority at Severnaya.

293
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,730
据我所知，榜首是你的老朋友
The top name on the list is an old friend of yours, I understand.

294
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,930
巫洛莫
Ourumov.

295
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,480
他晋升了将军
They made him a General.

296
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,050
自以为是俄国下一位铁腕人物
He sees himself as the next Iron Man of Russia.

297
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:43,610
分析家认为他不可能叛国，他不在嫌疑犯名单上
So our political analysts rule him out He doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

298
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,710
也是这些分析家说黄金眼是不可能存在的吗？
Are these the same analysts who said that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

299
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,490
他们还说直升机事件没有威胁
Who said the helicopter posed no immediate threat..

300
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,990
不值得调查？
and wasn't worth following?

301
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,430
邦德，你不喜欢我，你也不喜欢我的做法
You don't like me, Bond. You don't like my methods.

302
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,360
你认为我是会计
You think I'm an accountant...

303
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,960
做为会计，我更相信数据而不是你的直觉
a "bean counter," more interested in my numbers than your instincts.

304
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,470
- 我是这么想过 - 很好
- The thought had occurred to me. - Good.

305
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:08,310
因为我觉得你是个歧视女人厌恶女人的恐龙
Because I think you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur.

306
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,500
一个冷战的遗留人物，他那男孩的魅力...
A relic of the Cold War...

307
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,380
尽管对我不管用
whose boyish charms, though wasted on me, obviously appeal...

308
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,180
却迷倒了我派去评估你的少女
to that young woman I sent out to evaluate you.

309
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,450
- 我懂了 - 不完全，007
- Point taken. - Not quite, 007.

310
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,290
若你觉得我不敢派人送死
If you think for one moment I don't have the balls to send a man out to die...

311
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,860
你可就大错特错了
your instincts are dead wrong.

312
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,860
派你送死我心安理得
I've no compunction about sending you to your death.

313
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,900
但我不会轻举妄动，即使你以骑士的态度面对人生
But I won't do it on a whim, even with your cavalier attitude towards life.

314
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,130
我要你找到黄金眼
I want you to find GoldenEye.

315
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,770
找出谁是主犯，阴谋是什么，并且加以阻止
Find who took it, what they plan to do with it, and stop it.

316
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,180
如是遇到巫洛莫，不管有没有罪...
And if you should come across Ourumov, guilty or not...

317
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,250
遇上他千万别公报私仇
I don't want you running off on some kind of vendetta.

318
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,650
为艾力克报仇也救不活他
Avenging Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

319
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,090
- 不是你让他害死的 - 也不是你杀的他
- You didn't get him killed. - Neither did you.

320
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,280
这点你不必自责
Don't make it personal.

321
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,960
不会的
Never.

322
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,330
邦德
Bond.

323
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,130
活着回来
Come back alive.

324
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,210
(苏联 圣彼得堡)

325
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,340
早，巫将车
Good morning, General Ourumov.

326
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,910
国防部长米西根，各位好
Defense Minister Mishkin, gentlemen.

327
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,510
请开始报告
Please deliver your report.

328
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,530
据各位所知，一个秘密武器别号黄金眼...
As this Council is aware, 72 hours ago...

329
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,120
...在72小时前在塞维亚遭到引爆
a secret weapon system code-named GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.

330
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,560
作为太空部负责人
As head of Space Division...

331
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,430
我会亲自调查
I personally undertook the investigation.

332
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,130
我认为这个罪行是西伯利亚分裂主义者所为
I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists...

333
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,770
希望造成政治动乱
seeking to create political unrest.

334
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,780
很不幸...
Regrettably, the peaceful work...

335
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,280
塞维亚的太平工作与外汇收入...
and much-needed hard currency earnings of Severnaya...

336
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,370
...不得不倒退几年
have been set back by several years.

337
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,390
在此我愿引咎辞职
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

338
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,150
委员会不想拿你开刀
It seems the Council does not want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

339
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,630
只要你保证不会再有其他的金眼睛卫星武器
Merely your loyal assurance that there are no other GoldenEye satellites.

340
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,720
我向你保证，国防部长
I can give you that assurance, Defense Minister.

341
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,960
那失踪的两名技术员呢？
And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?

342
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,400
我只知道一名，葛波洛
I was aware only of the one, Boris Grishenko.

343
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:57,480
还有一名女孩没找到尸体
There was a girl also whose body was not among the dead.

Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova, a level-two programmer.

345
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,480
我会马上调查
I will investigate immediately, Defense Minister.

346
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,850
在你手下下落不明前
It would seem presumptuous, General...

347
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,020
断然指责...
to blame this incident on Siberian separatists...

348
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,490
西伯利亚分裂者不太好
before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.

349
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,820
不是吗？
Do you agree?

350
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,160
是的，部长
Yes, Defense Minister.

351
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,430
谢谢你提醒我
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

352
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,940
没事了
That will be all.

353
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,350
早安，Q，腿怎么了？滑雪跌伤？
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

354
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,480
打猎
Hunting!

355
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,090
注意，007
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

356
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,000
你的车，宝马

360
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,910
我对这个特别感到骄傲
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

361
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,380
车灯后面，刺螯飞弹
Behind the headlights, stinger missiles.

362
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,720
太好了，辛苦工作了一天，可以发泄一下
Excellent. Just the thing for unwinding after a rough day at the office.

363
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,090
我要提醒你，007
Need I remind you, 007...

364
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,460
虽然你有杀人执照...
that you have a licence to kill...

365
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,590
但开车还是不能违规
not to break the traffic laws.

366
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,660
- 我怎么敢 - 很好
- I wouldn't think of it. - Good.

367
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,170
现在来点实用知识
Right. Let's get on to more practical matters.

368
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:28,000
普通男用皮带

370
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,940
- 玩完了没？ - 好了

371
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,010
很好，普通皮带
Good. A typical leather belt.

372
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,840
这玩意我很熟
Q, I'm familiar with that device.

373
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:45,510
皮带扣藏有75尺钢丝
Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord built into the buckle.

374
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,850
它能射出铁勾
Fire, and out shoots a piton...

375
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,660
加上强韧钢丝支撑你的重量
followed by a high-tensile wire designed to support your weight.

376
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,100
要是我要载人呢？
I see. And what if I need additional support?

377
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,670
只能一个人用，007
It's tested for one, 007.

笔，这是一只四级手榴弹

381
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,080
按三次后四秒引爆

382
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,710
马上再按三次就取消
Another three disarms it.

383
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,450
你说时间多久？
How long did you say the fuse was?

384
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,550
别玩了，007!
Oh, grow up, 007!

385
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,560
大家都说笔比剑更可怕
They always said the pen was mightier than the sword.

386
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,290
因为我，此话成真
Thanks to me, they were right.

387
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,400
咱们请费迪示范一次
Look, let's ask Freddie here to demonstrate for us.

388
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,800
对不起，费迪

392

还有他的残舷
Along with the rest of him.

393
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,780
请你试着让这些装备

完璧归赵

别碰那个，那是我的午餐

伦敦四月是春天
In London, April's a spring month.

397
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,400
是吗？你在报道气象吗？
Oh, yeah? And what are you, the weatherman?

398
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,230
拜托，另一个有密码和口令...
For crying out loud, another stiff-assed Brit...

399
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,140
...的英国佬
with your secret codes and your passwords.

400
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,110
总有一天，你们得学学别用这套
One of these days you guys are going to learn just to drop it.

401
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,440
算了吧，我的车在那儿
Come on, my car's over there.

402
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,700
- 你先请 - 谢谢
- After you. - Thank you.

403
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,960
就像你说的，别来这套
Like you said, drop it.

404
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,040
好，在伦敦四月是春天
In London, April's a spring month...

405
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,110
圣彼得堡却冷得要命
whereas in St. petersburg we're freezing our butts off!

406
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,170
这样够了吗？
Now, is that close enough for government work?

407
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,270
不够，给我看玫瑰
No. Show me the rose.

408
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,610
饶了我吧
Please, no.

409
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,810
好吧，好吧

Someone of your stature must've realized the skill was not to hit your knee...

493
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,920
而是饶你老命

494
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,490
你为什么饶我？

他们很残暴，死了活该

中校，你不需要用枪

这要看你的安全做爱的定义是什么

那就够近的了

531

543
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,690
我不会睡不着觉
I won't lose sleep over it.

544
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,960
那就做个好梦吧
Sweet dreams.

545
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,990
嗨，詹姆斯
Hello, James.

546
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,290
- 艾力克？ - 死人复活了
- Alec? - Back from the dead.

547
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,830
不再是情报局纪念墙上的无名氏
No longer just an anonymous star on the memorial wall at MI6.

548
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,830
怎么了？不是开玩笑？
What's the matter, James? No glib remark?

549
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,600
不反言相讥？
No pithy comeback?

550
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,070
为什么？
Why?

551
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,680
你这问题真可笑
Hilarious question, particularly from you.

552
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,350
你问过为什么吗？
Did you ever ask why?

553
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:55,480
为何要努力推翻暴政强权？
Why we toppled all those dictators, undermined all those regimes?

554
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,150
回国被褒扬一番
Only to come home: "Well done, good job. But sorry, old boy.

555
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,060
然后发现生活全变了
Everything you risked your life and limb for has changed."

556
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,960
- 这是我们的选择 - 你一定会这么说
- It was the job we were chosen for. - Of course you'd say that.

557
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:09,900
詹姆斯・邦德，女王的忠犬
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier...

558
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,200
捍卫所谓的“信仰”
defender of the so-called "faith."

559
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,710
拜托啦，詹姆斯，把枪拿开
Oh, please, James, put it away.

560
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,940
你每一步都在我意料之中
It's insulting to think I haven't anticipated your every move.

561
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,640
没错
Yes.

562
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:27,350
- 我信任你，艾力克 - 信任？
- I trusted you, Alec. - Trust?

563
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:30,290
真好笑
What a quaint idea.

564
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,230
为什么情报局没发觉你父母是哥萨克人？
How did the MI6 screening miss that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

565
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:39,060
你又错了，他们知道
Once again, your faith is misplaced. They knew.

566
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,690
我们都是孤儿
We're both orphans, James.

567
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,740
你的父母有幸死于山难
But where your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident...

568
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,500
我父母逃过英人的背叛和斯大林的毒手
mine survived the British betrayal and Stalin's execution squads.

569
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:54,470
我父亲却不愿他们自己活在耻辱中
But my father couldn't let himself, or my mother, live with the shame of it.

570
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,740
情报局以为我太小不记得
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

571
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,450
而人生却少有的讽刺
And in one of life's little ironies...

572
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,790
父母被英国出卖决定自尽
the son went to work for the government whose betrayal...

573
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:09,120
儿子却为这国家工作
caused the father to kill himself and his wife.

574
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,250
你才会变成亚努
Hence, Janus.

575
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,830
双面的罗马门神
The two-faced Roman god come to life.

576
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,600
这脸非上帝造成，是拜你所赐
It wasn't God who gave me this face, it was you...

577
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:21,610
把炸弹设定三分钟而不是六分钟
setting the timers for three minutes instead of six.

578
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:23,610
我该同情你吗？
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

579
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:27,040
不，你该为我而死
No. You're supposed to die for me.

580
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,750
对了...
Oh, by the way...

581
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,790
...我本想邀你参加我的小计划
I did think of asking you to join my little scheme...

582
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:37,410
不过我知道...
but somehow I knew...

583
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,480
007永远把任务摆在朋友之前
007's loyalty was always to the mission, never to his friend.

584
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,730
散场了，最后通知
Closing time, James. Last call.

585
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,640
为了英国，醒醒
For England, James.

586
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,320
先生
Mister!

587
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,780
醒醒，拜托
Wake up, please!

588
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,950
- 醒醒， - 我在这儿
- Wake up! - I'm here.

589
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,360
- 我在这儿 - 快!
- I'm here! - Hurry!

590
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,900
赶快
Hurry up! Come out!

591
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,930
振作点，我们快死了!
Pull yourself together! We're going to die!

592
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,500
想个办法，从这出去!
Do something! Get us out of here!

593
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,910
我被绑住了，算了吧
I'm a little tied up Never mind.

594
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,370
(发射时间)

595
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:45,200
(发射)

596
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:03,350
(目标)

597
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,100
(紧急跳出)

598
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,320
收集飞机里程数还真辛苦
The things that we do for "frequent flyer" mileage.

599
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:55,690
让我帮你一把
Here, let me help you.

600
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,760
就这样，小心头
That's it, mind your head.

601
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,430
放开我
Let me go!

602
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:54,250
你是谁？
Who are you?

603
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,790
我和你是一伙，来帮你的
Listen, I'm on your side. I'm here to help you.

604
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,290
- 我什么都不知道...- 我不相信你
- I don't know anything. - I don't believe you.

605
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,290
- 我不在乎 - 瞧!
- I don't care what you believe. - Look!

606
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,420
他们随时都会回来，你要么趁机跟我走...
They might be back for us any minute. You either take your chances with me...

607
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:07,760
或者跟随塞维亚杀人屠夫
or your fellow countrymen who killed everyone at Severnaya.

608
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:10,700
我从没去过塞维亚
I've never been to Severnaya.

609
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,040
你的表去过，在金眼睛爆炸中停了
Your watch has. Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.

610
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:18,300
你猜你一定是爬上接收盘后逃出来的女孩
And I'm willing to bet you're the one who climbed up the dish to get out

611
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,010
- 你是谁？ - 我替英国政府做事
- Who are you? - I work for the British government.

612
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,580
你说的越多，我就越有办法帮你
And the more you tell me, the more I can help you.

613
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:29,120
- 但我什么都不知道 - 从你知道的开始说吧
- But I don't know anything! - Then let's start with what you do know.

614
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,590
我叫娜坦雅
My name is Natalya Simonova.

615
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,600
塞维亚的程式设计师
I was a systems programmer at Severnaya facility until

616
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,370
说下去
Go on.

617
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,240
- 直到他们杀死了所有人 - 谁？艾力克？
- Until they killed everyone. - Who? Alec Trevelyan?

618
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,250
我不认识他
No. I don't know who that is.

619
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,980
谁是内贼？叛徒？
Who was the insider? Who was the traitor?

620
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,380
葛波洛
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

621
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:04,450
- KGB还是军方？ - 电脑程式设计师
- KGB or military? - Computer programmer.

622
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,750
- 没别人了吗？ - 没有
- There was no one else? - No.

623
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,460
他们会杀我
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

624
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,670
相信我
Trust me.

625
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:21,040
相信你？我连你叫什么都不知道
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

626
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,730
早，邦德先生
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

627
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,240
坐吧
Sit.

628
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,610
我是国防部长，米西根
I'm Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

629
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,990
我们该怎么处决你，邦德先生？
So, by what means shall we execute you, Commander Bond?

630
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:41,150
什么？不先聊聊吗？
What, no small talk?

631
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:44,820
不闲聊一下？现在的人都不懂得严刑拷打
No chitchat? That's the trouble with the world today.

632
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:49,490
这是个失传的艺术
No one takes the time to do a sinister interrogation anymore. It's a lost art.

633
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,470
我并不欣赏你的幽默
Your sense of humor doesn't slay me, Commander. I'm sorry.

634
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,770
- 黄金眼在哪里？ - 你没有吗?
- Where is the GoldenEye? - I assumed you had it.

635
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,500
我有英国间谍，塞维亚人程式设计师和直升机...
I have an English spy, a Severnaya programmer and the helicopter they took.

636
01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:00,480
贵国叛徒想要的...
That's what some traitor in your government wanted it to look like.

637
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,280
- 谁背后指使你攻击？ - 谁又在弄权...
- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya? - Who had the authorization codes?

638
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,980
恐怖份子还是死罪
Russia may have changed, but the penalty for terrorism is still death!

639
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:10,250
- 叛国罪呢？ - 你们俩都住口，闭嘴
- And what's the penalty for treason? - Stop it, both of you! Stop it!

640
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,260
你们简直就像小孩子抢玩具
You're like boys with toys.

641
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,260
是巫洛莫，是他发射武器
It was Ourumov. General Ourumov set off the weapon.

642
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,600
我亲眼目睹
I saw him do it.

643
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,430
你确定吗？
Are you certain it was Ourumov?

644
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:31,700
他杀死了每个人，还偷走了黄金眼
Yes. He killed everyone and stole the GoldenEye.

645
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,610
他为什么这么做？
And why would he do that?

646
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,350
还有另一枚卫星
There is another satellite.

647
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,420
另一颗黄金眼
Another GoldenEye?

648
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,360
谢谢你，席小姐
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

649
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:52,230
你是说严刑拷打失传了
You were saying something about the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

650
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,360
部长，我要抗议!
Defense Minister, I must protest!

651
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:59,370
此案由我调查，你太过分了
This is my investigation. You are out of order.

652
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:04,070
据我所知，你才过分
From what I am hearing, it is you who's out of order!

653
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:07,140
- 我见过这把枪 - 把枪放下
- I have seen this gun before. - Put it down.

654
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,980
- 跟我们的敌人共处 - 把枪放下!
- In the hand of our enemy. - Put it down, General!

655
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,070
你知道敌人是谁吗?
Do you even know who the enemy is, Dimitri?

656
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,810
- 你知道吗？ - 警卫
- Do you? - Guard!

657
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,090
国防部长
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...

658
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,230
被英国情报员詹姆斯・邦德杀害了
murdered by a British agent, James Bond.

659
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,940
他逃亡时也遭到射杀，警卫
Himself shot while trying to escape. Guards!

660
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,320
来呀
Come on!

661
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,350
他们在档案室
They're in the archives!

662
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:37,060
下面
Down!

663
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,110
另外一边
Spread out! Cover the other side!

664
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,780
相信我
Trust me.

665
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,900
快走
Go now!

666
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,690
快点
Faster!

667
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,270
可恶
Damn it!

668
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:12,820
开进巷子
Down the alley!

669
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:15,880
快撞上去
Use the bumper! That's what it's for!

670
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,010
那是什么？
What was that?

671
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,750
左转
Go left!

672
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:14,590
出来
Get out!

673
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,820
若你没带来大礼
Either you've brought me the perfect gift, General Ourumov...

674
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,890
你就会让我很生气
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

675
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:15,430
米西根捷足先登
Mishkin got to them before I could.

676
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:19,450
邦德还活着？
Bond is alive?

677
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:20,960
他逃走了
He escaped.

678
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:24,300
邦德得意了，你就糟糕了
Good for Bond. Bad for you.

679
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,900
坐下来吧，亲爱的
Take a seat, my dear.

680
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,820
我和詹姆斯无话不谈
You know, James and I shared everything.

681
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,560
绝对是无话不谈
Absolutely everything.

682
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,040
胜者为王
To the victor go the spoils.

683
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,540
你会喜欢我们要去的地方
You'll like it where we're going.

684
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:21,690
你可能还会喜欢我
You may even learn to like me.

685
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,030
看住她
Stay with her.

686
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:40,170
邦德
Bond.

687
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,510
一定是邦德
Only Bond.

688
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:44,780
他要让我们出轨
He's going to derail us.

689
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:46,880
全速前进
Full speed!

690
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:49,910
全速前进，撞死他
Full speed! Ram him!

691
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,750
你为何不乖乖去死？
Why can't you just be a good boy and die?

692
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,980
你先死
You first

693
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:03,060
你是下一个
You... second.

694
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,460
举起来
Up!

695
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:11,830
情况看来，陷入绝境了
Situation analysis: hopeless.

696
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:16,310
你没有后援，也没退路
You have no backup, no escape route.

697
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:19,040
而我还有一个筹码
And I have the only bargaining chip.

698
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,770
她人呢？
Where is she?

699
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,910
你致命的弱点
Oh, yes. Your fatal weakness.

700
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,480
巫洛莫，带她进来
Ourumov, bring her in.

701
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:31,560
漂亮妞
Lovely girl.

702
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:35,150
尝起来就...像草莓
Tastes like... Iike strawberries.

703
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,190
- 我可不知道 - 我知道
- I wouldn't know. - I would.

704
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,740
重回原点啦
So, back where we started, James.

705
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:51,600
为朋友还是为使命？
Your friend or the mission.

706
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:54,300
把枪放下，我就不杀她
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

707
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,250
巫洛莫，他答应你什么了?
Ourumov, what has this Cossack promised you?

708
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,020
你知道，对不对？他是哥萨克人
You knew, didn't you? He's a Lienz Cossack.

709
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:10,290
- 都过去了 - 他会背叛你
- It's in the past. - He'll betray you!

710
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,660
- 就跟别人一样 - 是真的吗？
- Just like everyone else. - Is this true?

711
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:18,500
事实是48小时后我们会比上帝还有钱
What's true is that in 48 hours you and I will have more money than God.

712
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,040
这里将为邦德先生开个小小的葬礼
And Mr. Bond here will have a small memorial service...

713
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:25,670
只有钱班霓小姐和几个酒肉朋友会去
with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

714
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:31,050
所以，你打算怎么办？詹姆斯
So, what's the choice, James?

715
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:35,280
两个目标，时间只能射一个
Two targets. Time enough for one shot.

716
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,290
女孩，还是使命？
The girl, or the mission?

717
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,520
杀了她，她对我无任何意义
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

718
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,190
地狱见吧，詹姆斯
See you in hell, James.

719
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,510
一寸厚铁甲
One-inch armor plating.

720
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,940
我没事，谢谢你
I'm fine, thank you very much!

721
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,580
- 波洛，太好了 - 你在干嘛？
- Boris, yes! - What are you doing?

722
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:12,020
波洛在线上
Boris is on-line, backing up his files.

723
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,960
我能找出他们的去处
If I can spike him, I might be able to find out where they're going.

724
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,990
别光站在那儿，设法让我们逃生
But don't stand there! Get us out of here!

725
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,160
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

726
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,520
祝你好运，詹姆斯
Good luck with the floor, James.

727
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:46,320
我设定时炸弹到六分钟引爆，跟你给我的六分钟一样
I set the timers for six minutes-- the same six minutes you gave me.

728
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,860
这是我至少能对朋友做到的
It was the least I could do for a friend.

729
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:55,300
- 他什么意思？ - 我们只有三分钟
- What does that mean? - We've got three minutes.

730
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,470
(通讯中断 请传送破坏讯号)

731
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,170
(破坏讯号已传送)

732
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:26,840
(输入密码 屁股和臀部)

733
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:28,320
(无效)

734
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,270
屁股还叫什么？
What else do you call your butt?

735
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,500
- 什么？ - 波洛的密码
- What? - It's Boris' password.

736
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,570
“什么是能坐却不能带走？”
He plays word games: "What I sit on, but I don't take it with me."

737
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:38,580
- 椅子 - 我说过
- Chair. - Like I said.

738
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,860
(椅子 开始搜寻)

739
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,310
剩三十秒
Thirty seconds.

740
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,750
不在俄国，德国，巴黎，伦敦，马德里
He's not in Russia, Germany, Paris, London, Madrid.

741
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:49,250
二十五秒
Twenty-five seconds.

742
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:51,480
...纽约，多伦多，芝加哥，旧金山...
New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco.

743
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:53,080
二十秒!
Twenty seconds!

744
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:55,350
墨西哥市，里约，迈阿密
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.

745
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:02,560
- 快点呀 - 等等
- Come on! - Wait!

746
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:05,100
他在古巴 哈瓦那 不
He's in Cuba, Havana. No.

747
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:05,790
(断线)

748
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,360
现在!
Now!

749
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:30,720
你都破坏你所有乘坐的交通工具？
Do you destroy every vehicle you get into?

750
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,920
标准操作程序
Standard operating procedure.

751
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:36,930
有玩具的男孩
"Boys with toys."

752
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:43,540
也许我该安排一下到古巴的交通工具
Maybe I should take care of the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

753
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,310
去古巴？
Our trip?

754
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:48,880
你会拆除卫星武器吗？
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

755
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,280
这要看你说是哪种武器
I suppose that depends on what kind of weapon you're talking about disarming.

756
01:33:57,190 --> 01:34:00,350
那么，告诉我
So, tell me.

757
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:03,760
...还有其他别的什么“标准操作过程”...
Are there any other standard operating procedures...

758
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:06,760
我应该知道的，中校？
I should be aware of, Commander?

759
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,470
数不完
Thousands.

760
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:16,470
但是都只是...
But I only pay them...

761
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,370
嘴上说说而已
Iip service.

762
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,260
我一生都梦想到加勒比海
My whole life, I dreamed about coming to the Caribbean.

763
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:47,430
真美极了
It's so beautiful.

764
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,030
漫无人迹
Not another human being in sight.

765
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:05,620
你跟交通工具犯冲吗?
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

766
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,120
嗨，金博
Yo, Jimbo!

767
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:35,710
那老头叫我带个礼物给你
Brought a little gift from old what's-his-name, uh, T, Z--?

768
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:37,480
- Q - 对
- Q. - Yeah.

769
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:41,150
- 你来干嘛？ - 榕树
- What are you doing here, Wade? - Banyan trees.

770
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,850
就算我没来
I am not here.

771
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,950
中情局不知情不干涉...
The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement, absolutely nothing to do...

772
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,430
你到古巴跟我们无关，懂吗?
with your insertion into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

773
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,730
懂，我很明白
Yes, I do, perfectly.

774
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,030
飞机是向缉毒组朋友借的
Borrowed the plane from a friend of mine in the DEA.

775
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,770
海岸防卫队知道此事
Now, the Coast Guard and the FAA are both in the loop.

776
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:58,670
你在我们的雷达上消失了六小时
You're cleared on our radar for 0600 hours.

777
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:01,080
上面有最新的探测仪器
Here's the latest Sat-Int from Langley.

778
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:05,120
- 保持六百尺以下 - 五百尺
- Stay below 600 feet. - 500 feet.

779
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,520
- 她是谁？ - 娜坦雅席曼娜
- Who's that? - Natalya Siminova.

780
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,020
娜坦雅・席米娜
Natalya Simonova.

781
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,280
俄国交通部长
Russian Minister of Transportation.

782
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:16,550
你查过她吗？
Did you check her out?

783
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:19,150
- 从头到脚 - 好啊
- Head to toe. - Right.

784
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:24,190
你要找的足球场大的卫星天线，根本没有
So, you're looking for a dish the size of a football field, huh?

785
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,790
在古巴什么事情也瞒不过我们
Doesn't exist. You can't light a cigar in Cuba without us seeing it.

786
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:29,240
我知道一定有，跟塞维亚的一样
I know it's there.

787
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:32,370
在你们在纽西兰的秘密发射器一样
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

788
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,480
我从没去过那，她怎么知道的？
I've never been to New Zealand. How'd she know about that?

789
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,810
我需要支援怎么办？
What if I need backup?

790
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,150
通过广播联络 我会派海军陆战队来
Get on the radio. I'll send in the Marines.

791
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,610
跑道尽头转左
Anyway, hang a left at the end of the runway.

792
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,120
- 古巴在右边八十哩 - 好啦，韦德
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right. - Yo, Wade.

793
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,560
有一件事，别乱按车上的钮
Just one thing: Don't push any of the buttons on that car.

794
01:36:54,670 --> 01:36:58,500
- 我只是兜兜风 - 是啊
- I was going to go bombing around in it. - Exactly.

795
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:02,970
詹姆斯，我有信心，但你要小心点，他知道你要来
Yo, James, I got faith. But be careful. He knows you're coming.

796
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:10,460
特维阳是你的朋友
He was your friend, Trevelyan?

797
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,510
现在他是你的敌人，你要杀死他
And now he's your enemy and you will kill him.

798
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,610
就这么简单
It is that simple?

799
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:23,590
也就是说，一点也没错
In a word, yes.

800
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:25,780
除非他先杀死你
Unless he kills you first

801
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:28,050
- 娜坦雅... - 你以为我会有好印象？
- Natalya... - You think I'm impressed?

802
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,460
你们这些人只会拿枪杀人，为了什么？
All of you with your guns, your killing, your death. For what?

803
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,050
只是为了当个英雄吗？
So you can be a hero?

804
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,660
- 英雄难逃一死 - 听我说
- All the heroes I know are dead. - Natalya, listen to me.

805
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:40,860
你怎么能这么做？你怎么能这么冷酷无情？
How can you act like this? How can you be so cold?

806
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:45,170
这样才能活下去
It's what keeps me alive.

807
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:47,740
不！
No.

808
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:50,610
你才会这么孤独
It's what keeps you alone.

809
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:30,890
詹姆斯
James?

810
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,490
什么事？
Yes?

811
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:44,630
在火车上...
On the train...

812
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:49,200
你叫他杀我，还说我对你无意义
when you told him to kill me and I meant nothing to you...

813
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:51,210
你是真的吗？
did you mean it?

814
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,830
是的
Yes.

815
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:59,470
基本规则，一定要骗他们
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

816
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,420
不...
No.

817
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:42,890
往南十度，方位一八四
Turn ten degrees south, bearing one-eight-four.

818
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,620
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

819
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:12,350
什么都没有，这里什么都没有
Nothing. There is nothing here.

820
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:15,750
再绕一次
Let's make another pass.

821
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:31,000
也许韦德是对的，什么都没有
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

822
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:31,330
娜坦雅
Natalya.

823
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:36,530
邦德先生，这次，换我占到上风了
This time, Mr. Bond, the pleasure will be all mine.

824
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:57,520
等一下才到你
Wait for your turn.

825
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:33,850
她一向都喜欢这样
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

826
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,430
卫星进入接收范围吗?
Is the satellite in range?

827
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,530
- 再过六分钟 - 开启接收天线
- Six minutes. - Prepare the dish.

828
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,510
不，太早，我还没好
No! It's too early. I am not ready.

829
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:55,140
开启
Do it!

830
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:27,170
难怪我们看不到
No wonder we couldn't see it.

831
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,680
来吧
Come on.

832
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,100
世上最好用的提款卡
The world's greatest cash card.

833
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,600
最好别被拒收
It had better not be rejected.

834
01:47:06,110 --> 01:47:09,080
- 天线已开启 - 长官
- Mischa is on-line. - Sir.

835
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,610
杀死他
Kill him!

836
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,780
他老是学不了乖
The man just won't take a hint.

837
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:24,290
- 目标座标 - 是伦敦
- Target coordinates? - The target is London.

838
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,740
他准备向卫星发出讯号
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

839
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,810
- 怎么阻止他？ - 天线上的发射器
- How do you stop it? - The transmitter above the antenna

840
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,640
天线已就位
Antenna in position.

841
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,690
倒数
On my count.

842
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:25,790
三，二，一
Three... two... one.

843
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:38,010
（伦敦）

844
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:51,770
（武器准备就绪）

845
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:57,110
天佑女王
God save the Queen.

846
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:18,040
电脑主机
The mainframe computer.

847
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:19,370
别动
Don't move.

848
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,060
詹姆斯，真是意想不到啊
James! What an unpleasant surprise.

849
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:51,230
- 我的目标是取乐于你 - 那女孩呢？
- We aim to please. - Where's the girl?

850
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,660
把她找到
Find her!

851
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:04,910
Q那老家伙好吗？
So, how is old Q?

852
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:07,180
还是他的老一套吗？
Up to his usual tricks?

853
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,840
手表
The watch.

854
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:16,290
新款式
A new model.

855
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,760
还是按这里吗？
Still press here, do I?

856
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:37,700
装配得挺有趣，艾立克
Interesting setup, Alec.

857
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:41,110
你侵入了英国银行电脑转帐...
You break into the Bank of England via computer...

858
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:43,910
...把钱用电脑转出
and then transfer the money electronically...

859
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:46,750
然后马上启动黄金眼
just seconds before you set off the GoldenEye...

860
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:49,950
毁灭一切证据
which erases any record of the transactions.

861
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,890
- 真高明 - 谢谢，詹姆斯
- Ingenious. - Thank you, James.

862
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,970
不过这是小偷的行为
But it still boils down to petty theft.

863
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,630
你最终也不过是个银行抢劫犯
In the end, you're just a bank robber.

864
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:03,470
跟个小偷差不多
Nothing more than a common thief.

865
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,060
(进行编列密码)

866
01:52:13,050 --> 01:52:15,850
你眼光老是这么狭窄
You always did have a small mind, James.

867
01:52:15,950 --> 01:52:17,980
我们不只销毁银行记录
It's not just erasing bank records.

868
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:20,820
而是毁灭全伦敦的电脑系统
It's everything on every computer in Greater London:

869
01:52:20,930 --> 01:52:25,360
税捐记录、股市信用记录...土地登记
tax records, the stock market, credit ratings, land registries...

870
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:28,230
犯罪记录
criminal records.

871
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:30,930
再过十六分钟又四十三秒
In 16 minutes and 43 sec--

872
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:34,990
不，四十二秒后英国将回到石器时代
No, 42 seconds-- the United Kingdom will reenter the Stone Age.

873
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:37,600
全球金融瓦解
A worldwide financial meltdown.

874
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:42,700
疯狂的艾力克完成了五十年的凤愿
And all so mad little Alec can settle a score with the world 50 years on.

875
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:46,340
哦 拜托 詹姆斯别对我心理分析
Oh, please, James. Spare me the Freud.

876
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:49,720
杀人无数以后
I might as well ask you if all the vodka martinis ever silence the screams...

877
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:51,620
烈酒能让哀号宁静吗
of all the men you've killed.

878
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:58,220
你在那些女人怀中得到宽恕了吗？
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women...

879
01:52:58,330 --> 01:53:01,420
对于所有那些你不能保护的死者
for all the dead ones you failed to protect.

880
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:07,000
英国将懂得背叛的代价
England is about to learn the cost of betrayal...

881
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,970
1945年的萧条
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

882
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:15,310
- 欢迎加入，亲爱的 - 娜坦雅!
- Welcome to the party, my dear. - Natalya!

883
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,520
别再这么做了!
Don't ever do that again!

884
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:55,710
你玩不起这游戏
This is not one of your games, Boris.

885
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:59,280
人真的会死虫，你这可怜
Real people will die! You pathetic little worm.

886
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:03,520
她在电脑主机上动过手脚，快查!
She was in the mainframe. Check the computer.

887
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:07,790
她这笨蛋，二流程式设计师
She's a moron. A second-level programmer.

888
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:11,700
她只处理过导航系统
She works on the guidance system.

889
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:15,360
她没有发射密码
She doesn't even have access to the firing codes.

890
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,270
制动火箭发射中
Retrorockets firing!

891
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:41,050
这到底是怎么回事？
What the hell's happening?

892
01:54:41,170 --> 01:54:44,970
卫星十二分钟后重返大气层
We will have reentry in... 12 minutes!

893
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:46,020
（任务取消）

894
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,970
- 会在大西洋某地上空烧毁 - 快处理
- It will burn up over the Atlantic. - Deal with it!

895
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,410
她改了密码
She changed the access codes!

896
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:56,350
她可以改回来
Well, then she can fix it.

897
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:03,680
尽管杀他，杀了他，他对我无意义
Go ahead, shoot him. He means nothing to me.

898
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,450
我可以
I can do it!

899
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,860
- 我可以破解她的密码 - 那么，快做
- I can break her codes. - Then get on with it!

900
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:39,580
告诉他，快点
Tell him, now!

901
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:44,890
把密码告诉我，告诉我
Give me the codes, Natalya! Give them to me!

902
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:00,770
- 波洛能破解密码吗？ - 有可能
- Can Boris break your codes? - Possibly.

903
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,910
有可能？
Possibly?

904
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,450
我们得摧毁发射器
We have to destroy the transmitter.

905
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:12,390
另外，我很好，谢谢关心
By the way, I'm fine, thank you very much.

906
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:42,020
你知道怎么用吗？
Do you know how to use one of these?

907
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:46,880
知道
Yes.

908
01:56:46,990 --> 01:56:49,190
很好，躲起来
Good. Stay out of sight.

909
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:06,470
- 还剩多久？ - 二分钟…一分钟
- How long? - Two minutes. One minute.

910
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:08,740
- 警卫 - 我正在做
- Guard! - I'm fixing it!

911
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:12,320
他敢溜就宰了他
If he moves, kill him.

912
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,430
（重新设定时间08:23）

913
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:34,300
（传送指令）

914
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:37,430
我所向无敌!
Yes! I am invincible!

915
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:43,360
（天线重新定位）

916
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:14,620
（天线失效）

917
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:52,230
詹姆斯，你要知道...我一向比你强
You know, James... I was always better.

918
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:11,490
一号呼叫基地
Alpha One to Gunship.

919
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:15,090
一号呼叫基地!
Alpha One to Gunship!

920
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:17,540
说话
Speak to me!

921
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:54,750
为了英国，詹姆斯?
For England, James?

922
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:57,690
不...
No.

923
02:02:57,790 --> 02:02:59,190
...为了我
For me.

924
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,970
我所向无敌
Yes! I am invincible!

925
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:48,240
詹姆斯，詹姆斯
James! James!

926
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:50,240
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

927
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:55,600
我没事，谢谢
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

928
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:08,710
要是被人看见怎么办？
Suppose someone is watching?

929
02:05:08,830 --> 02:05:12,020
方圆25里内没人，相信我
No. There's no one within 25 miles, believe me.

930
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:14,530
哟，金博
Yo, Jimbo!

931
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:28,400
你这算是及时解围吗？
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh, coming through in a clinch?

932
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:34,150
烟草种植园，我说我会来的
It's tobacco plants. I said I'd be here, huh?

933
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:36,220
海军陆战队兄弟
Yo! Marines!

934
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,760
你们不如到关塔那莫去继续互相亲热
Maybe you two would like to finish debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

935
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,530
- 可以吗？ - 我不跟你坐直升机
- You ready? - I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

936
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:58,870
不跟你坐飞机或火车
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

937
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:02,170
亲爱的，怎么会有声？
Darling, what could possible go wrong, eh?

938
02:07:00,230 --> 02:07:04,990
（为了纪念德瑞克・莫丁斯）

939
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:52,500
（詹姆斯会再现身）
