2
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,729
Beg your pardon. Forgot to knock.

3
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,068
Ni odnoho vyzdoha! Gdye vashy?

4
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,987
I'm alone.

5
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,076
Aren't we all?

6
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,581
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

7
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,752
- Ready to save the world again?
- After you, 006.

8
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,178
- James... For England.
- For England, Alec.

9
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,789
(bleeping)

10
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,251
(click)

11
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:10,059
- It's too easy.
- Half of everything is luck, James.

12
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,895
And the other half?

13
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,730
(alarm)

14
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,691
Fate.

15
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,528
- Set timers: Six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.

16
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,765
Fire!

17
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,438
- Closing time, James! Last call!
- Buy me a pint.

18
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,708
This is Colonel Ourumov!
Come out with your hands up!

19
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,585
How original.

20
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,966
Shut the door, Alec! There's a draught!

21
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,263
Alec?

22
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,905
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

23
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,825
- Finish the job, James! Blow them to hell!
- You have ten seconds.

24
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,454
Ten,

25
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,916
nine, eight,

26
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,044
seven, six,

27
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,506
five, four,

28
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,258
- three, two...
- For England, James!

29
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,515
Hold your fire! You'll blow the gas tanks!

30
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,478
This is your last chance!
Come out with your hands...

31
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,318
Wait!

32
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,153
You can't win.

33
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,467
(Ourumov) Get out there! Move! Move it!

34
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,275
Hold your fire!

35
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,104
Wait!

36
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,427
("GoldenEye" by Tina Turner)

37
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,703
See reflections on the water

38
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,458
More than darkness in the depths

39
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,004
See him surface in every shadow

40
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:17,009
On the wind, I feel his breath

41
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,305
GoldenEye, I've found his weakness

42
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:26,226
GoldenEye, he'll do what I please

43
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,522
GoldenEye, no time for sweetness

44
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,819
But a bitter kiss
will bring him to his knees

45
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,120
See him move
through smoke and mirrors

46
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,583
Feel his presence in the crowd

47
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,880
Other girls, they gather around him

48
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,842
If I had him, I wouldn't let him out

49
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,514
GoldenEye, not lace or leather

50
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,268
Golden chain, take him to the spot

51
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,190
GoldenEye, I'll show him forever

52
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,569
It'll take forever to see what I've got

53
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,116
You'll never know

54
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:27,746
How I watched you
from the shadows as a child

55
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,500
You'll never know

56
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:37,256
How it feels
to get so close and be denied

57
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,468
It's a golden honey trap

58
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,889
I've got for you tonight

59
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,475
Revenge, it's a kiss

60
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,769
This time I won't miss

61
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:58,110
Now I've got you in my sight

62
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,031
With a GoldenEye

63
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,120
Golden, GoldenEye

64
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,249
With a GoldenEye

65
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,463
GoldenEye

66
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,033
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
- More often than you'd think.

67
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,963
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

68
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,678
- Who's that?
- The next girl.

69
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,825
(Bond sounds horn)

70
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,840
(woman sounds horn)

71
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,370
James, stop this! Stop it!

72
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,707
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear?

73
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,002
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

74
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,254
- Engine?
- Ego.

75
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,133
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

76
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,596
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we?

77
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,134
Ladies first.

78
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,984
James, I want you to stop this car!

79
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,654
- Really?
- Stop this car at once!

80
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,326
(tyres screech)

81
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,082
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

82
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,875
Huh!

83
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,466
James, you're incorrigible.

84
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,427
What am I going to do with you?

85
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,931
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

86
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,439
(Bond) A very thorough evaluation.

87
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,024
(woman giggles)

88
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,298
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Très heureux de vous revoir.

89
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,636
- Bonsoir, Pierre. Ça va bien?
- Très bien. Et vous?

90
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,492
Sept à la banque.

91
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,704
Madame wins.

92
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,130
Bet, mademoiselle? Non?

93
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,883
Monsieur.

94
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,093
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

95
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,722
- No players?
- (Bond) Banco.

96
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,781
It appears we share the same passions.

97
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,699
Three, anyway.

98
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:42,287
I count two - motoring and... baccarat.

99
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,291
(croupier) Huit, pour la banque.

100
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,129
(croupier) Seven. Madame wins.

101
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,133
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

102
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,136
One rises to meet a challenge.

103
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,849
Double.

104
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,976
Suivez.

105
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,616
Carte.

106
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,717
(croupier) Madame stands with five.

107
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,224
- Six. Madame loses.
- Buliatch!

108
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,856
- Enjoy it... while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.

109
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,197
And what words do you live by?

110
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,411
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.

111
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,746
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

112
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,542
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

113
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,794
And for you?

114
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,046
The same.

115
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,215
How do you take it?

116
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,427
Straight up, with a twist.

117
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,140
Thank you, Mr...

118
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,351
The name's Bond. James Bond.

119
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,854
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

120
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,066
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

121
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,071
- Your accent... Georgian?
- Mm! Very good, Mr Bond.

122
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,616
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.

123
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,411
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

124
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,665
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

125
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,169
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

126
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,547
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

127
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:03,595
A tip for your friend: The French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

128
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,306
Even the counterfeit ones.

129
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:13,605
Oh. And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?

130
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,273
Commander.

131
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,609
Shall we go?

132
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,695
This one is an admiral.

133
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,281
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

134
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,826
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.

135
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,996
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

136
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,945
(laughing)

137
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,461
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

138
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:04,340
Identification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

139
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,344
Current suspected links to the Janus
crime syndicate, St Petersburg.

140
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,140
Yacht "Manticore" is leased
to a known Janus corporate front.

141
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,601
M authorises you
to observe Miss Onatopp,

142
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,189
but stipulates no... contact
without prior approval.

143
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,691
End of transmission. Moneypenny.

144
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,987
Good night, James. I trust
you'll stay... "onatopp" of things.

145
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,156
(Xenia shrieks)

146
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,537
(Xenia snarls)

147
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,089
Lyubeemyets.

148
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,927
(Xenia growls)

149
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,111
- (admiral cries out in pain)
- (Bone cracks)

150
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,783
Xenia, I... can't... breathe!

151
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,744
(admiral gasps for air)

152
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,833
(he cries in pain, she with pleasure)

153
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,128
Yes! Yes!

154
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,384
(military band plays)

155
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,187
Merci, mon amiral.

156
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,697
My respects, Admiral.

157
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,536
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.

158
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,041
Ladies and gentlemen,

159
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,420
please take your seats
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

160
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:25,500
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battlefield:

161
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,128
The first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

162
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,966
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

163
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:37,345
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

164
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,098
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

165
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,646
(whistles)

166
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:53,278
Shh. I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

167
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,571
I think I've gone to heaven.

168
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,365
Not yet.

169
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:09,210
- (captain) Please welcome the pilots.
- (Applause)

170
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:15,633
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant François Brouse.

171
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,971
(engines start)

172
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,520
(man shouting in Russian)

173
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,328
- Select Mir.
- (Bleep)

174
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,539
- Orthographic projection.
- (Bleep)

175
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:34,087
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage geo-sat two.

176
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,096
Anna.

177
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,769
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

178
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,857
Boris.

179
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,902
- Boris!
- What?

180
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,698
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

181
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,160
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

182
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,622
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

183
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,127
All right. All right. I'll give you a hint.

184
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:19,799
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

185
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,428
You're such a geek.

186
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,097
- (bleeping)
- Yes! I'm in.

187
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,065
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

188
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,234
What if they trace it here?

189
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:42,196
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

190
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,783
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

191
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,870
I think not.

192
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:53,082
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

193
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,211
You were saying, slug-head?

194
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,173
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

195
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,219
- Spiked them!
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.

196
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,139
No way! I spiked them.

197
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,729
- All right. What's the password?
- I'm not going to tell you.

198
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,690
OK. Let me guess.

199
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,443
- It's not in front of me?
- Mm-mm.

200
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,071
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

201
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,497
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

202
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,917
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

203
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,837
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

204
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,302
"Better luck next time,

205
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,304
"slug-heads."

206
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,725
Bang! Gone! I am invincible!

207
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,942
Was it good for you, too?

208
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,611
I'm getting some coffee.

209
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,613
I'm going for a cigarette.

210
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,836
(helicopter)

211
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:14,640
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

212
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,322
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

213
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:33,618
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

214
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,121
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

215
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,918
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 100km.

216
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,629
Good.

217
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,797
Here is the authorisation code.

218
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,927
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

219
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,180
I am timing you.

220
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,880
Good. Thank you, Major.

221
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,190
(moans with pleasure)

222
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,211
On my count.

223
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:10,631
Three... two... one...

224
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,434
Set target. Severnaya.

225
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,156
Arm the weapon.

226
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,203
(bleeping)

227
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,083
(ringing)

228
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,469
(buzzing)

229
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,597
(glass shatters)

230
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,766
- Check it.
- (Cocks firearm)

231
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,729
- (man groans)
- (Alarm)

232
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,530
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

233
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,657
(klaxon)

234
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,485
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

235
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,275
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

236
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,528
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

237
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,948
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.

238
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,869
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?

239
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,538
I know you'll find this crushing, 007,

240
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:51,375
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

241
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,837
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

242
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,591
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.

243
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,260
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

244
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,637
What would I ever do without you?

245
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,892
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

246
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,272
Hope springs eternal.

247
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,026
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

248
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,571
Really? What's the penalty for that?

249
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,908
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.

250
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:32,499
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.

251
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,257
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What's up?

252
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,052
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

253
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:47,139
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

254
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:56,899
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?

255
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,320
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

256
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,447
Mm-hm.

257
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,495
- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...

258
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:14,792
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

259
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,711
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

260
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,923
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

261
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,051
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.

262
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,303
Thank you.

263
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,224
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

264
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,143
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.

265
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,729
What do you think the base is used for?

266
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,649
We suspected it might be
the ground station

267
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,569
for a secret space-based
weapon called GoldenEye, but...

268
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:47,533
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

269
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,661
Numbers were never my strong suit.

270
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,205
Are these pictures live?

271
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,084
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

272
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,527
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

273
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,663
(alarm sounds)

274
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,259
What the bloody hell was that?

275
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,229
Aaaarghhh!

276
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,758
(shrieks)

277
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,806
Aaarghhhh!

278
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,598
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

279
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,603
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

280
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,146
(clang)

281
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,427
Aargh!

282
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,929
Boris! Boris!

283
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,348
Thanks.

284
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,811
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.

285
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,400
We have another,
coming into range... now.

286
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,281
Good God.

287
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,742
Two of the MiGs are down.

288
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,245
It looks like the third went into the dish.

289
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,372
What do you think?

290
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,544
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

291
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,589
- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.

292
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,467
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.

293
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:02,556
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

294
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,725
I've read the brief.

295
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,438
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

296
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:14,693
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

297
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:20,032
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

298
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,618
So, GoldenEye exists.

299
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,330
Yes.

300
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,875
- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.

301
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,420
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

302
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,090
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

303
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:41,511
- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.

304
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,598
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

305
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:49,853
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

306
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,816
(punches keys)

307
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,613
There had to be an insider.

308
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,998
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

309
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,714
(animal whimpering)

310
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,051
(barking and whining)

311
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,148
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

312
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,696
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

313
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,950
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

314
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,035
What else do we know about Janus?

315
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,497
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.

316
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,542
Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

317
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,003
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

318
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,215
The woman, Onatopp,

319
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,467
is our only confirmed contact.

320
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,263
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

321
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,392
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.

322
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,228
- Ice?
- Yes.

323
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:25,866
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

324
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,078
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

325
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,334
Ourumov. They made him a general.

326
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,379
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

327
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:43,425
Our political analysts say
he doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

328
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,512
Are these the same analysts who said
that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

329
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:52,642
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?

330
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,897
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

331
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,943
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

332
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,404
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

333
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,741
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

334
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,912
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

335
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,582
obviously appealed to that
young woman I sent out to evaluate you.

336
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,919
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

337
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,714
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

338
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,175
your instincts are dead wrong.

339
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,220
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

340
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:32,891
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

341
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,605
I want you to find GoldenEye.

342
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,025
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

343
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,653
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

344
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:50,033
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

345
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:55,038
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

346
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,874
Never.

347
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,380
Bond...

348
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,884
Come back alive.

349
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,515
(military march)

350
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,705
(knock on door)

351
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,760
Good morning, General Ourumov.

352
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,181
Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

353
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,059
Please, deliver your report.

354
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,026
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -

355
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,194
was detonated over Severnaya.

356
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:12,907
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

357
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:17,579
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

358
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,290
seeking to create political unrest.

359
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,837
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

360
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,757
have been set back by several years.

361
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,134
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

362
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,720
(protests)

363
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,724
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

364
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,269
Merely your assurance that
there are no other GoldenEyes.

365
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,980
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.

366
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,067
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

367
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,823
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

368
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,035
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

369
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,330
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

370
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,083
I will investigate immediately.

371
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:08,546
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

372
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:13,051
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

373
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:17,347
- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.

374
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,101
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

375
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,521
That will be all.

376
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,871
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

377
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,835
Hunting.

378
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,379
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

379
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,464
First, your new car.

380
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:56,136
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

381
00:50:56,721 --> 00:51:01,850
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

382
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,562
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

383
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,565
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

384
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,318
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

385
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:19,075
Need I remind you, 007, that you have
a license to kill, not break the traffic laws.

386
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,203
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

387
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,331
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

388
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:31,421
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

389
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,759
Have you finished?

390
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,343
- Yes.
- Good.

391
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,430
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.

392
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,851
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

393
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,146
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

394
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:52,192
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

395
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,528
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

396
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,198
It's tested for one, 007.

397
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,997
Flight 878 to St Petersburg.

398
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,502
X-ray document scanner.

399
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,880
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

400
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,509
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

401
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,804
Another three disarms it.

402
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,892
How long did you say the fuse was?

403
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,561
Oh, grow up, 007.

404
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,774
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.

405
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,903
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

406
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,658
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

407
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,042
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?

408
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,170
Along with the rest of him.

409
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,757
Now, 007, do please try and return...

410
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,052
(clattering)

411
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,722
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

412
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,724
Don't touch that! That's my lunch.

413
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,920
In London, April's a spring month.

414
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,673
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?

415
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,843
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

416
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,345
with your secret codes and passwords.

417
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,682
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

418
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,602
Come on. My car's over there.

419
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,994
- After you.
- Thank you.

420
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,082
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.

421
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,794
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

422
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,756
- Close enough for government work?
- No.

423
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,968
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.

424
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,721
All right, all right, all right.

425
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,527
- "Muffy"?
- Third wife.

426
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,531
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

427
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,617
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

428
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,829
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

429
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,624
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?

430
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:59,212
(announcement in Russian
over PA system)

431
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:05,176
(PA system) St Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.

432
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,685
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

433
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,814
- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

434
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,401
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

435
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,070
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

436
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,243
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

437
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:34,455
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

438
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,875
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

439
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,420
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

440
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,841
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

441
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,802
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

442
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:52,015
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

443
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,647
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

444
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:02,233
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

445
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,819
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.

446
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,864
- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.

447
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,682
Yes?

448
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,102
- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?

449
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,357
24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.

450
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,821
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.

451
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,949
- You pay dollars?
- Of course.

452
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,202
If madam requires a demonstration...

453
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:58,498
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

454
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,555
Natalya.

455
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,604
(typing)

456
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,118
- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.

457
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,966
(Wade) Let me get this straight, Jimmy.

458
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,803
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

459
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,223
And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

460
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,810
- (Bond) Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?

461
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,021
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.

462
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,566
OK. Showtime.

463
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,574
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

464
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,742
Are you sure you wanna do this?

465
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:22,373
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.

466
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,502
Make sure they send me home first class.

467
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,600
- (screams)
- Natalya! It's me! It's Boris!

468
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,727
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

469
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,146
Shh-shh-shh.

470
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,444
Another morning shot to hell.

471
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:39,367
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.

472
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,124
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

473
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:52,421
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

474
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:56,384
- Lucky me.
- I think not.

475
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,054
Ooh-ahh

476
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,723
(Russian accent) And if you love him

477
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:03,975
Love him

478
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,019
Oh, be so proud of him

479
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,187
Of him

480
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,982
Cos after all

481
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,567
He's just a man

482
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,781
(tunelessly) Stand by your man...

483
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,995
James Bond.

484
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,957
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

485
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,669
"Shaken, but not stirred."

486
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,632
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.

487
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,093
Or your need for an audience.

488
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:43,931
- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?

489
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:46,225
Stand by your man

490
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,815
That is Irina, my mistress.

491
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,736
Very talented girl.

492
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,280
Irina! Take a hike!

493
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,081
So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you
to my neighbourhood? Hm?

494
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:14,462
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?

495
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,256
I hear the new M is a lady.

496
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,343
I want you to do me a favour.

497
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,723
He wants me to do him a favour!

498
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:32,813
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.

499
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,525
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?

500
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,111
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...

501
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,863
Silence!

502
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,408
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

503
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:49,288
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to...

504
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,707
Miss the rest of you.

505
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:57,421
- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.

506
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,759
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

507
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,599
Kirov's funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.

508
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,936
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

509
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,481
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

510
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,109
their man drives the hearse out.

511
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,903
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

512
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,990
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

513
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,118
Your money.

514
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,912
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

515
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:33,624
I want you to set me up... with Janus.

516
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:38,587
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.

517
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,007
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.

518
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:46,137
- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.

519
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:51,308
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

520
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,103
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

521
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:58,941
This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

522
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,361
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

523
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,030
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

524
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,701
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

525
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:13,247
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

526
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,959
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

527
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,878
who promptly had them all shot.

528
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,547
Women, children, families.

529
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,801
Not exactly our finest hour.

530
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,972
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

531
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:34,101
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

532
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:38,522
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and...

533
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,734
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.

534
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:47,049
You don't need the gun... Commander.

535
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:51,220
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

536
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,310
That's close enough.

537
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,938
Not for what I have in mind.

538
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,077
(Xenia moans with pleasure)

539
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,124
(Xenia shrieks)

540
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,548
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

541
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,134
(laughs)

542
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:38,434
- (Bond gasps for breath)
- (Xenia shrieks with pleasure)

543
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,986
You think you can break me?

544
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:57,119
(Bond roars)

545
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,997
(shrieking) Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!

546
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,250
(Xenia yelps)

547
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,465
No, no, no.

548
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,009
No more foreplay.

549
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,678
Take me to Janus.

550
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:15,763
Buliatch!

551
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,655
- This is it?
- Yes.

552
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,452
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

553
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:42,539
- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

554
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:47,002
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.

555
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,382
Sweet dreams.

556
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,900
(clink)

557
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,581
Hello, James.

558
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,482
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

559
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:36,069
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.

560
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:40,783
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?

561
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,661
- Why?
- (Laughs)

562
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,874
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

563
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:54,797
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

564
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,218
only to come home - "Well done!
Good job, but sorry, old boy."

565
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,554
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."

566
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,350
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

567
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,978
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,

568
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,314
defender of the so-called faith.

569
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,858
Oh, please, James, put it away.

570
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:18,695
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

571
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,242
Yes.

572
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:29,998
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.

573
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,629
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

574
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,383
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

575
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,844
We're both orphans, James.

576
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:46,181
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

577
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:49,726
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

578
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,065
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

579
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:59,361
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

580
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,531
And in one of life's little ironies,

581
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,909
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

582
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,705
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

583
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:15,168
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

584
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,213
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

585
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,967
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

586
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:27,431
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.

587
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,436
By the way,

588
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:37,691
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

589
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,777
007's loyalty was always
to the mission,

590
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,989
never to his friend.

591
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,743
Closing time, James. Last call.

592
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,620
(gunshot)

593
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:04,760
For England, James.

594
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,263
- (woman) Wake up! Mister!
- (Electronic bleeps)

595
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:09,848
(woman shrieks)

596
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:13,185
Wake up, please! Wake up!

597
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,270
I'm here. I'm here!

598
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:18,398
Hurry! Hurry up! Come on!

599
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,444
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die!

600
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:28,742
- Do something! Get us out of here!
- I'm a little tied up!

601
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,410
Never mind.

602
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,825
(alarm)

603
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,701
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

604
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,996
Here. Let me help you.

605
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,707
That's it. Mind your head.

606
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,633
Let me... go!

607
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,136
(vehicles approaching)

608
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,179
Who are you?

609
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,684
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.

610
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,770
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

611
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,147
Look, they might be back any minute.

612
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:08,068
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?

613
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,946
I've never been to Severnaya.

614
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,366
Your watch has. Frozen
by the GoldenEye blast.

615
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,995
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

616
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,375
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

617
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,961
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

618
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:30,215
- But I don't know anything!
- Then start with what you do know.

619
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,644
My name is Natalya Simonova.

620
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,940
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

621
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,109
Go on.

622
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,655
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

623
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:58,243
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?

624
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,662
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

625
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:04,666
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

626
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:08,003
- There was no one else?
- No.

627
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,091
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

628
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,969
Trust me.

629
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:20,974
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

630
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,601
(door opens)

631
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,687
Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.

632
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:35,864
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

633
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:39,367
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

634
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,536
What, no small talk?

635
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,747
No chitchat?

636
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,460
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

637
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,464
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.

638
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,133
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

639
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,845
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

640
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,515
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?

641
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,311
- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.

642
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,649
- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it.

643
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,235
You're like... boys with toys.

644
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,743
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

645
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,120
I saw him do it.

646
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,959
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.

647
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,587
He killed everyone,
then stole the GoldenEye.

648
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:37,050
And why would he do that?

649
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,803
There is another satellite.

650
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,183
Another GoldenEye.

651
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,853
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

652
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,399
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?

653
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,900
(door opens)

654
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:58,238
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

655
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,491
- You are out of order.
- Molcheetye. Molcheech!

656
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:05,578
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

657
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,039
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

658
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:12,419
- Put it down, General!
- Do you even know who the enemy is?

659
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,379
- Do you?
- Guard!

660
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,513
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

661
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:28,643
murdered by
British agent James Bond,

662
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,733
himself shot while trying to escape.

663
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,318
Guards!

664
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,247
Come on!

665
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,039
They're in the archive!

666
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,462
Down!

667
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:31,391
(Ourumov) Spread out!
Cover the other side!

668
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,601
Trust me.

669
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,276
(Natalya cries out)

670
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,403
Argh!

671
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:12,223
Go now!

672
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,241
(car horn)

673
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,796
Faster!

674
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,027
Damn it.

675
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,827
Down the alley!

676
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,389
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

677
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,528
Nazad!

678
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,452
(police siren)

679
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,832
(car horn)

680
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:37,387
(police whistle)

681
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,612
What was that?

682
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,109
Go left!

683
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,814
(tyres squeal)

684
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,485
Get out!

685
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:13,334
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

686
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,295
Mishkin got to them before I could.

687
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,924
Bond is alive?

688
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,760
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.

689
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:26,556
Bad for you.

690
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:31,143
Take a seat, my dear.

691
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,830
You know, James and I
shared everything.

692
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,209
Absolutely everything.

693
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,465
To the victor go the spoils.

694
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,060
You'll like it where we're going.

695
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,903
You may even learn to like me.

696
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,454
- Svinya!
- (Bleeping)

697
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,414
Stay with her.

698
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:42,423
Bond. Only Bond.

699
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:45,593
He's going to derail us.

700
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,512
- Full speed!
- Shto?

701
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,389
Full speed! Ram him!

702
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,434
Bye-bye.

703
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,522
(train whistle)

704
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,708
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?

705
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,418
You first.

706
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,586
You... second.

707
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,214
Up!

708
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,138
Situation analysis... hopeless.

709
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,308
You have no backup, no escape route.

710
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,353
And I have the only bargaining chip.

711
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:24,025
- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

712
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,195
Ourumov, bring her in.

713
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,782
Lovely girl.

714
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,494
Tastes like... like strawberries.

715
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,621
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

716
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:49,050
So, back where we started, James.

717
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:51,969
Your friend, or the mission?

718
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,722
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

719
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:02,855
Ourumov... what has
this Cossack promised you?

720
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,318
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

721
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:12,198
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you! Just like everyone else.

722
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,367
- Is this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours,

723
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:18,579
you and I will have
more money than God,

724
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,249
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service,

725
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:26,754
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

726
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:31,092
So, what's the choice, James?

727
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:35,262
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

728
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,890
The girl, or the mission?

729
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,935
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

730
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:45,856
See you in hell, James.

731
01:30:57,077 --> 01:31:01,705
- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!

732
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,796
Boris. Yes!

733
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:12,508
- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.

734
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:16,929
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

735
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:22,560
- Don't stand there! Get us out of here!
- Yes, sir.

736
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:42,830
(Alec) Good luck with the floor, James.

737
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:46,667
I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.

738
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,171
It was the least I could do for a friend.

739
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,593
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

740
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,670
- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?

741
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,841
Boris' password. He plays word games.
"What I sit on but don't take with me."

742
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:38,886
- Chair.
- Like I said...

743
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:44,350
(Bond) 30 seconds.

744
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:48,062
(Natalya) He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,

745
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:51,273
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,

746
01:32:51,358 --> 01:32:53,317
- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds!

747
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,736
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

748
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:05,663
- Come on!
- Wait! He's in Cuba. Havana - no.

749
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,249
Now!

750
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:31,021
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?

751
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,816
Standard operating procedure.

752
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,444
Boys with toys.

753
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:44,076
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

754
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:46,620
Our trip?

755
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,999
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

756
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:55,504
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

757
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:03,804
So... tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

758
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:06,765
I should be aware of, Commander?

759
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,689
Thousands.

760
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,317
But I only pay them

761
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,944
lip service.

762
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:45,512
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

763
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,848
It's so beautiful.

764
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,184
Not another human being in sight.

765
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,353
(fast bleeping)

766
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:06,116
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

767
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:36,146
Yo, Jimbo! Brought a little gift
from old... whatshisname? T? Z?

768
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,773
- Q.
- Yeah.

769
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:41,610
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

770
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:45,322
Uh... I am not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

771
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:49,076
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

772
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,786
Mm-hm. Yes, I do.

773
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,580
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

774
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:56,166
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

775
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,919
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

776
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,338
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

777
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:05,259
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

778
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:07,886
- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.

779
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:11,014
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.

780
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,183
(Wade clears throat)

781
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,645
Did you check her out?

782
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,148
- Head to toe.
- Right...

783
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:25,696
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football field, huh? Doesn't exist.

784
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,366
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.

785
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:34,204
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

786
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:37,124
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?

787
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,461
- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

788
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,965
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

789
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,718
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade!

790
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:55,309
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

791
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,812
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.

792
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,316
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

793
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,612
- He knows you're comin'.
- (Starts engine)

794
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,009
He was your friend - Trevelyan.

795
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,889
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

796
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,851
It is that simple?

797
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,105
In a word, yes.

798
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,567
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...

799
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:31,572
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

800
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:34,449
So you can be a hero?

801
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,995
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...

802
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:41,290
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

803
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:46,086
It's what keeps me alive.

804
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:50,382
No. It's what keeps you alone.

805
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:31,840
James...

806
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,469
Yes?

807
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,602
On the train,

808
01:39:45,063 --> 01:39:49,483
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

809
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,276
did you mean it?

810
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:54,780
Yes.

811
01:39:56,366 --> 01:39:59,618
Basic rule: Always call their bluff.

812
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,038
(Bond laughs)

813
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,957
No.

814
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:43,286
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1-8-4.

815
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,288
Yes, sir.

816
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:13,525
Nothing. There is nothing here.

817
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:16,236
Let's make another pass.

818
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,501
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

819
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,548
(Natalya screams)

820
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,812
Natalya.

821
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,443
(Bond groans)

822
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,787
(shrill birdsong)

823
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:36,793
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

824
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,797
(cries out in pain)

825
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,637
(Xenia gasps with pleasure)

826
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:50,515
(Bond growls)

827
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:58,189
You wait for your turn.

828
01:44:06,574 --> 01:44:08,241
(shrieks)

829
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:34,017
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

830
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:49,032
- Is the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.

831
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,826
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.

832
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:55,413
- I am not ready.
- Do it.

833
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,295
(klaxon)

834
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:28,655
No wonder we couldn't see it.

835
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,834
Come on.

836
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,685
The world's greatest cash card.

837
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:01,730
It had better not be rejected.

838
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:09,589
- Mischa is on-line.
- (Guard) Sir!

839
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,679
Kill him.

840
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:19,265
The man just won't take a hint.

841
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:20,683
Hm!

842
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:24,729
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

843
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:40,328
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

844
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,331
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.

845
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:18,283
Antenna in position.

846
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:22,996
On my count.

847
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,499
Three... two... one.

848
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:40,138
(ringing)

849
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,739
God save the Queen.

850
01:48:57,907 --> 01:49:00,033
(klaxon)

851
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:09,709
(men shouting in Russian)

852
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:20,094
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.

853
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:07,225
(fast bleeping)

854
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:49,767
James! What an unpleasant surprise.

855
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:53,021
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?

856
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:55,815
Find her!

857
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,991
So, how is old Q?

858
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:07,869
Up to his usual tricks?

859
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,788
The watch.

860
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:16,919
Ah. A new model.

861
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:19,380
Still press here, do I?

862
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,853
(man shouting in Russian)

863
01:51:36,315 --> 01:51:38,524
(Bond) Interesting setup, Alec.

864
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,694
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

865
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:44,322
then transfer the money electronically

866
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,700
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye,

867
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:51,120
which erases any record
of the transactions.

868
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:54,540
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

869
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:57,585
But it still boils down to petty theft.

870
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:02,799
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

871
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:15,770
You always did have
a small mind, James.

872
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:21,567
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

873
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:26,447
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

874
01:52:26,532 --> 01:52:28,699
criminal records.

875
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:32,995
In 16 minutes and 43... no, 42 seconds,

876
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:35,832
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

877
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:38,918
A worldwide financial meltdown.

878
01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:43,214
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

879
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:47,885
Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you

880
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:52,557
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

881
01:52:55,436 --> 01:52:59,439
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

882
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,983
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

883
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,697
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

884
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:10,658
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

885
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:15,788
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- (Boris) Natalya!

886
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,628
(Natalya grunts with rage)

887
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:28,092
(cocking of weapons)

888
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:54,160
Don't ever... do that again.

889
01:53:54,495 --> 01:53:57,914
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die!

890
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:01,042
You pathetic little worm.

891
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,170
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

892
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:08,341
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

893
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,844
She works on the guidance system.

894
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:15,473
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

895
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:18,142
(buzzer alarm)

896
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,854
Retro-rockets firing.

897
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:45,628
- What the hell's happening?
- We will have re-entry in... 12 minutes.

898
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:49,715
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

899
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,761
- (Alec) Deal with it!
- She changed the access codes!

900
01:54:55,222 --> 01:54:57,723
Then she can fix it.

901
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:04,230
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

902
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:08,693
I can do it! I can break her codes!

903
01:55:08,777 --> 01:55:11,279
Then get on with it!

904
01:55:38,974 --> 01:55:41,142
Tell him! Now!

905
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,062
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!

906
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:03,539
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

907
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:05,708
Possibly?

908
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,045
We have to destroy the transmitter.

909
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:12,298
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!

910
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:44,080
Do you know how to use one of these?

911
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:47,500
Yes.

912
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:49,835
Good. Stay out of sight.

913
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:57,677
(men shouting in Russian)

914
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:06,560
- How long?
- Two minutes.

915
01:57:06,687 --> 01:57:08,229
- One minute.
- Guard!

916
01:57:08,355 --> 01:57:12,149
- I'm fixing it.
- If he moves, kill him.

917
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:38,068
Yes! I am invincible.

918
01:58:55,462 --> 01:58:56,796
(klaxon)

919
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:31,956
(clang)

920
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:50,242
You know, James?

921
02:00:51,912 --> 02:00:53,370
I was always better.

922
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:12,723
Alpha One to Gunship.

923
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:15,142
Alpha One to Gunship!

924
02:02:15,996 --> 02:02:18,122
Speak to me!

925
02:02:53,324 --> 02:02:55,284
For England, James?

926
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:56,952
No.

927
02:02:58,371 --> 02:02:59,580
For me.

928
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:01,665
Aaaaarghhhhh!

929
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,131
Aaaaaarghhhhh!

930
02:03:54,636 --> 02:03:56,220
Aaaarghhhhhh!

931
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,620
Yes! I am invincible!

932
02:04:46,437 --> 02:04:47,980
James! James!

933
02:04:48,773 --> 02:04:50,440
Are you all right?

934
02:04:53,987 --> 02:04:55,988
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

935
02:05:06,166 --> 02:05:08,333
Suppose someone is watching?

936
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:12,379
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

937
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,549
(Wade) Yo, Jimbo!

938
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:29,188
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?

939
02:05:30,815 --> 02:05:32,566
It's tobacco plants.

940
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:35,068
I said I'd be here, huh?

941
02:05:35,153 --> 02:05:36,528
Yo! Marines!

942
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:51,043
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo, hm?

943
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,923
- Ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

944
02:05:56,007 --> 02:05:59,343
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

945
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:02,346
Darling, what could

947
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:41,677
I know you dream a lot

948
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:47,266
Holding on to lies

949
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:52,604
And you wait around

950
02:06:56,693 --> 02:06:59,987
For someone to know where you hide

951
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:06,702
And in your dreams you feel a lot

952
02:07:09,122 --> 02:07:12,416
Though you keep it all inside

953
02:07:15,003 --> 02:07:17,838
And you close your eyes

954
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:24,469
It helps keep you alive

955
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:30,726
And the experience of lovin'

956
02:07:33,646 --> 02:07:36,356
Will take all the pain away

957
02:07:39,944 --> 02:07:43,280
Just understanding for the first time

958
02:07:44,157 --> 02:07:46,658
What you feel inside

959
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:49,995
When love is in your life

960
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:55,876
Leave your dreams behind

961
02:07:59,589 --> 02:08:04,301
Breathin' in the scent of love

962
02:08:05,845 --> 02:08:08,430
Leave your dreams behind

963
02:08:12,018 --> 02:08:18,023
Sensin' life in everything under the sky

964
02:08:30,244 --> 02:08:33,538
And the experience of lovin'

965
02:08:36,209 --> 02:08:39,336
Will take all the pain away

966
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:46,593
Just understanding for the first time

967
02:08:46,886 --> 02:08:49,262
What you feel inside

968
02:08:49,889 --> 02:08:52,808
When love is in your life

969
02:08:58,523 --> 02:09:01,817
The experience of love

970
02:09:05,446 --> 02:09:08,365
Under the sky

971
02:09:08,449 --> 02:09:10,492
Sensing life

972
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:14,037
The experience of love

973
02:09:15,623 --> 02:09:17,916
For the first time

974
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,502
Under the sky

975
02:09:20,586 --> 02:09:23,171
Will take all the pain away

976
02:09:23,256 --> 02:09:26,425
The experience of love

977
02:09:30,471 --> 02:09:33,223
Under the sky

978
02:09:33,558 --> 02:09:36,017
When love is in your life

979
02:09:36,102 --> 02:09:39,855
The experience of love

980
02:09:41,524 --> 02:09:44,192
Take it now, feel the glow

981
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:46,945
Hold it close, don't let it go
