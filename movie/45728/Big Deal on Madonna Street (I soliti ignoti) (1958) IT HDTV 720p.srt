1
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:37,057
-The cops.
-Oh, no!

2
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:43,856
Freeze! Freeze!

3
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:51,572
-What did I do? I'm an honest citizen.
-Sure you are!

4
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,471
I'm trying to catch my tram.
My wife's waiting for me.

5
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,205
One, two, one, two, one...

6
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:08,275
Squad halt... right front... at ease.

7
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:11,203
One month later...

8
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,556
Hey, here I am!
Move it!

9
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,582
-You sure took your time.
-Hi.

10
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:26,165
-Norma my darling, are you fine?
-Just fine.

11
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:27,989
Counselor, are we all set?

12
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,914
Proietti, the best I can do is to
get you the minimum sentence.

13
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,783
Are you kidding?
I haven't confessed yet.

14
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:38,515
Counselor, I gotta get outta here,
now.

15
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:42,120
I've got a little job waiting
for me out of this joint

16
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,606
and if it turns out right,
I'll be set for life.

17
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:47,554
I met a guy in here

18
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,326
who told me something...

19
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:51,743
Hey, can't you yell quietly?

20
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,804
He's just told me my grandma has
been asleep for the last five days...

21
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,718
Well, keep it down
or you'll wake her up!

22
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,488
Counselor, let's find a legal
loophole 'cause I gotta get out.

23
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:00,801
Get the penal code out.

24
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,291
Listen here, article 403
is no good.

25
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:09,023
Go to 117, page 128.

26
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:12,467
You're an old offender...
if anything we might claim 521.

27
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,993
No, that's no good anymore.

28
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,650
We gotta claim 124 or 606.

29
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:19,560
How?
You were caught red-handed.

30
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,136
Did you already forget about 1400?

31
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,440
What's this 1400?

32
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,396
1400... the model you wanted
to steal...

33
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,796
Steal? Are you crazy?

34
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,492
I don't even have a driver's license.

35
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,216
What are you doing? I see,

36
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,570
you did all you could do.
I need a substitute.

37
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,928
I don't have any.

38
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:38,802
Not for you, for me.

39
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,365
I don't get mixed up
in this kind of business!

40
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:43,212
Who's asking you?
Go on, get lost.

41
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,518
Maybe I'll call you again when
I need to draw my will.

42
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,737
-Norma...
-Yes?

43
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,207
Listen here. Capannelle has
100,000 lira of mine.

44
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,579
Did you hear me?

45
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:53,432
That's to find someone
who'll take the rap for me.

46
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,767
A scapegoat, d'you hear me?

47
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:58,967
You know that when I come out,
if I pull that job,

48
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,044
I'll buy you a fur coat.

49
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,227
Marry me instead.

50
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,115
What? I'll get out of this short
sentence to get life?

51
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:06,686
Are you crazy?

52
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,348
-Call Othello.
-Why?

53
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:18,681
He's gotta take the rap
for someone else,

54
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,291
but just for a couple of months.

55
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,662
He's already in.
They pinched him yesterday.

56
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,825
Watch it, grandpa,
you blew my shot.

57
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:34,572
And you blew my eye out
of its socket! Damn it all...

58
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,781
Tell me kid, do you know
a guy called Mario,

59
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,286
who lives around here?

60
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,903
There are a thousand Marios
around here.

61
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,510
Yes, but this one is a thief.

62
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,798
There are still a thousand.

63
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,233
How much for this?

64
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:57,912
Stealing strollers now?

65
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:00,727
It's the only vehicle left
with wheels and no alarm.

66
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,982
We gotta paint it
or they'll recognize it.

67
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,701
Is 3,000 lira all right?

68
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:07,467
Hey, Mario. I've been looking for
you for the last two hours...

69
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,112
-May l?
-Be my guest.

70
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:11,892
-Eight thousand.
-No, take it away.

71
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:16,021
Listen up, I've got something
for you. Cosimo needs a scapegoat.

72
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:18,180
Just for a few months,
but very well paid.

73
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,842
A matter of a few months,
why doesn't he serve them?

74
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,310
'Cause a very big job
came his way.

75
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,942
Are we set for 4,000, then?

76
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,208
4,000 and you throw in these
three umbrellas.

77
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,732
Hey, it's a baby carriage,
you know!

78
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,373
Fine, fine!

79
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,118
Are you winking at me?

80
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,571
Who's winkin'? I got hit in the eye.

81
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:41,913
Right, you got hit!

82
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:44,018
What are all the umbrellas for?

83
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,117
They're for my mother.

84
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,694
Holy cow! It always pours
in your mother's 'hood!

85
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,431
She misleads them all the time.
She'll stop bothering me.

86
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,611
So, what'd you say?
100,000 right away

87
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:55,533
and a little extra
once the job's done.

88
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,380
I'd go in myself, only I've taken
the rap three times already.

89
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,400
If I'll show up again it's life.

90
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:10,388
It's not like I don't want to,

91
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,999
but what do I tell my mother,
"See you, I'm off to prison"?

92
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,940
-Always your mother!
-Mind your business!

93
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,801
You're already on your way there!

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,465
Send the Sicilian guy,
Cosimo's pal!

95
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,470
-Who's this Sicilian?
-The small, skinny guy.

96
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:23,159
The one who keeps his sister
under lock as if she were a relic?

97
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,258
Ferribotte?

98
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,668
Michele. Michele,
someone's at the door.

99
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,369
Into the kitchen and
stay there 'til I tell you.

100
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:45,675
Who is it?

101
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,597
Friends... Mario and Capannelle.

102
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:56,654
-Greetings.
-Can't we come in for a moment?

103
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,204
Impossible. My sister's in.

104
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,425
I don't want her
to know about my business.

105
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,426
Besides, she's a minor
and she's engaged.

106
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:05,867
And when's the wedding?

107
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:07,580
The dowry question needs
to be settled.

108
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:09,675
She's gotta walk to the altar
with the greatest honor.

109
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,091
She mustn't be denied
a single thing.

110
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,000
See? Ferribotte is our man.

111
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:16,108
Well then, 100,000 lira would come
in handy for the dowry.

112
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:19,144
Not here.

113
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:23,058
Carmelina, I'm going downstairs.

114
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:26,822
Let's hear.

115
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,579
I can't leave Carmelina on her own.

116
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,922
And what if the groom found out?
Goodbye wedding.

117
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:50,549
He's from Abruzzi.

118
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,736
Those people from the North,
they're full of airs.

119
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,537
So difficult finding
a scapegoat these days!

120
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,021
Tiberio, the photographer...

121
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:01,593
He's in a very bad spot.

122
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,670
They've jailed his wife
for cigarette smuggling.

123
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:06,091
That's right.
Let's go see him. Move it.

124
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,585
Fine. I was looking for a scapegoat
and I only find shepherds.

125
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,369
Mario, take out the umbrellas.
Can't you see it's raining?

126
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:16,286
Are you crazy?
They're going to get wet.

127
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,809
What did you get them for, then?

128
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,365
Tiberio. Hey!

129
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,228
We've got business to discuss.

130
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,071
Shush! The kid's sleeping.

131
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:42,945
I though it was some serious deal.

132
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,433
Of course! Lucky you,
you don't have any! You'll see!

133
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:49,119
Can't you get laces for those shoes
instead of dragging them?

134
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,675
If he wakes up, I'll kill you!

135
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,576
It took me three hours
to put him to sleep.

136
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,709
Big deal!

137
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,468
Quiet... quiet I told you!

138
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,843
See, the slightest noise

139
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:04,617
irritates him, light irritates him...

140
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,574
he sleeps only in the darkroom...

141
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,914
-Did you hear about my wife?
-No...

142
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:14,385
80,000 fine, for cigarette smuggling,
commuted to three months.

143
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,968
Article 218. She's already
served one and a half months.

144
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:22,258
Such an unlucky year.
I even had to sell my camera.

145
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:26,097
No little jobs on the horizon,
some smuggling?

146
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,087
How about 100,000 lira
without lifting a finger?

147
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,227
-100,000 lira?
-Yes.

148
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:31,318
I could kiss you!

149
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,502
You've woken up the kid.

150
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:37,806
There he goes again.
Have you lost it?

151
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:40,848
What are you doing? Watch it! You
can cry your eyes out, I've had it!

152
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:45,904
He's so spoiled! So cute though!
Have you ever seen him?

153
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,420
-No.
-Come see him.

154
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,799
Cutie... come here daddy's darling.

155
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,340
Hey, we ain't got no time to waste.

156
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,957
You're laughing now.
What am I going to do with you?

157
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,206
What am I going to do?

158
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,804
You tell him.

159
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,597
Ferribotte,
what's up with you, man?

160
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:21,603
Attempted theft of private
property, Article 712: 6 months.

161
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,629
I am not a first time offender,
so I'll get 9 months for 100,000 fine.

162
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,773
That means 12,000 lira a month.
Big deal!

163
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:29,920
How much do you want?

164
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:33,193
No, we're far off... Stop it!

165
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:35,077
Get your hands off the baby food!

166
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,013
I understand you've lost
your teeth, still...

167
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,367
And right now I really can't.
Where would I leave the kid?

168
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,261
-In jail, with your wife.
-Sure!

169
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:47,178
They're well looked after in there.
They've got the best nursery ever.

170
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:51,326
The best in all Rome. I still
remember it. When I was three...

171
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,186
No, no, the kid'll go to jail
when he's all grown up.

172
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,542
-And if he chooses.
-Fine.

173
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:58,605
Guys, you'll never get an ex-con
for 100,000 lira.

174
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,470
You need someone with
a clean record.

175
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,166
Someone with a clean record?
Who knows someone like that?

176
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,880
-Actually, I do know someone...
-Who?

177
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,554
I understand it's almost April,
but why should I play the fool?

178
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,830
You're always broke.

179
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:17,019
And you still owe me for those
passport pictures.

180
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,340
Hey, do you or do you not
read the papers.

181
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:23,077
I'm favored, and if I win
I might even be a contender.

182
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:24,971
Sure, contend what?

183
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,090
With that spare tire around
your waist.

184
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:32,264
Are you Cosimo's moll?

185
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,840
Yea, why?

186
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,479
Well then, it must have
been a while since...

187
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:38,585
Get lost.

188
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:42,881
Over here.

189
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,283
If we each put in a little something,
we might make it.

190
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,798
-How much?
-There are five of us. 10,000 lira a head.

191
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,763
Marchetti, Picchioni.
Come on, it's your turn.

192
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,158
Coming.

193
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:01,468
What do you want?

194
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,249
Will 150,000 do?

195
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,813
We'll rustle up 50,000.

196
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,190
I can't.

197
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:10,738
I'd be barred from the ring,
understand?

198
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,380
Take it easy. You have no record.

199
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:15,639
You could get out on probation.
6 months at the most.

200
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,622
Listen, read the papers
tomorrow morning.

201
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,845
You'll find me in the sports pages,

202
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,214
and my opponent in the obituaries.

203
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,722
Hey, doll, come on inside. I'll show
you who's got the spare tire.

204
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,735
Bravo. That was a really
great idea!

205
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:39,069
Do you think a beefcake like him,
would ever play the scapegoat?

206
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:50,736
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

207
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,325
Bring in the self-confessed criminal.

208
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,924
Your Honor, when I read that a
poor old man was languishing in jail,

209
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,103
my conscience got the best of me.
I'm here to confess my crime.

210
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:08,240
It was me, it was me the scoundrel,

211
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:11,406
that forced the car door
and ran away.

212
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:13,184
Your Honor, this man is innocent.

213
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,400
-Oh, it's you!
-I'm the one.

214
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:17,764
You scum. I had to go through
the humiliation of been jailed,

215
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,333
because of you.

216
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,139
-I got thirteen months.
-Courage.

217
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,635
Thirteen months I got.
Me, an honest man.

218
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,805
A poor family man...
A sick, old man...

219
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:28,902
And all because of you! Jude!

220
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,497
I might deserve your contempt but
I'm imploring you to forgive me.

221
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,231
I even went to the Chapel
of Divine Love.

222
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,744
Please, help me clean this slate
and start anew, please.

223
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,769
All right, all right. If you've made
amends, I'll forgive you.

224
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:44,181
No hard feelings.

225
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:45,520
Thank you, thanks.

226
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:47,439
-Are you done?
-Yes, your Honor, yes.

227
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,947
Fine. Lock them up... both of them.

228
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:52,038
One, two, one, two, one...

229
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:00,413
Squad halt... right front, at ease.

230
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,745
Wait, wait.

231
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,493
Damn. It was you, you!

232
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:17,322
No, here we're all honest.
Put out your hand. Wait, wait.

233
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,506
What are you waiting for?

234
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,372
Cutie pie, if you don't give
back the dough,

235
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,586
you'll sleep with the fishes.
Got it?

236
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,127
I don't think so.

237
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,326
Listen, you coward...

238
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:41,286
Hey Cosimo, why did I get
the dough? To get locked up.

239
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:42,883
I am locked up.

240
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,910
And why did I give you the money?
To get out. Am I out?

241
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,047
-Well, what do you want?
-Scram.

242
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,310
You could have kept it up
a little better.

243
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,493
It's obvious you've never seen
any innocent people.

244
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:56,008
Is it my fault?
You were pathetic.

245
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:58,455
Such a shame! What would
you do outside anyway?

246
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,926
At least here,
they'll feed you for free.

247
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,402
Fine. You filthy beast.

248
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,296
I had a little job to take care of
if I got out.

249
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:08,444
No risks involved
and major payoff.

250
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,655
And instead, because of you,
everything has gone up in smoke!

251
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:14,425
What little job?

252
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:19,557
This Cosimo will tell you for sure!
So you can go and steal my plan?

253
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,421
And when you get out...
Oh, pretty boy, scram, scram!

254
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,224
I can't even think about it.
You know how the adage goes.

255
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,953
Think about it twice
and you're a cuckold.

256
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:30,758
Cuckold?! You're talking to me,
you dirty...

257
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,140
Let go or I'll kill you.

258
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,911
How dare you?
You're talking to me?

259
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,527
Chow, boys. Chow.

260
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,024
Pasta and beans.

261
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:07,599
This is the 1:45 to Ancona.

262
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,185
Who gives a damn?

263
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,544
May your father and mother
drop dead if you have a cigarette

264
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,702
and aren't sharing.

265
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,377
All orphans here, I see...

266
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,904
Pass the bottle
I want to have a puff.

267
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:34,361
Move.

268
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,094
Look, they've got their sentence.

269
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:43,416
Jailed for stealing hay.

270
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,775
They seem pretty beat.

271
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:54,880
The poor things must have
gotten a good licking!

272
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,847
-Go ask...
-You, go.

273
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,022
Boy, are you tired!

274
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:15,002
I bet you can't wait to die,
so you can rest forever.

275
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:25,397
How many? A few months?

276
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:26,841
Years.

277
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:28,830
Three years...

278
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,373
I guess you're happy now,
aren't you?

279
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:44,994
-How can it be?
-Right!

280
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:46,866
-I'd like our lawyer's opinion.
-Sure.

281
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:49,655
Counselor... oh, come here...
What's up?

282
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,264
Lawyer? This is your lawyer?

283
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,771
Get away, damn it, all is lost now.

284
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:01,789
Three years. Three years...
Oh, my poor mother. Damn it all.

285
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:02,904
It's not my fault!

286
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:06,537
And 150,000 lira.
My poor, poor mother!

287
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:08,217
Well, no.

288
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,399
You've buried me alive,
that's what you've done!

289
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,638
Come on, be a man!
Where's all your courage?

290
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,164
Sure...

291
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,230
What about me?
You call me lucky?

292
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:19,444
Don't you touch me.

293
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:23,763
-Peppe, come on, don't give in.
-Sure.

294
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:25,345
I'll take care of your mother...

295
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:28,735
if, when I get out I pull off
that job, you'll see...

296
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,957
If I were out right now,
damn it all!

297
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,514
Still thinking about that deal.

298
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,079
Some stupid lousy
idea, I bet you...

299
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,541
Stupid, eh?

300
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:42,236
Last month I met a bricklayer in
here. He was being transferred.

301
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,368
He'd stabbed his brother-in-law.

302
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:48,498
He told me he'd just finished
building a very thin partition wall...

303
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,990
one of those you could poke
open with your finger...

304
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:55,007
Between a... a dining room
and pawnshop.

305
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:59,900
And what do you think there was
in this room? The crib!

306
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,288
What?

307
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,763
The crib. The safe for the jewels!
The crib!

308
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:08,943
Now you tell me whose rotten luck
is it? Yours or mine?

309
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:11,469
Right... this makes me sleep easier!

310
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,511
And... and how were you gonna
get into the apartment?

311
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:17,850
Knocking? "May I come in?
I have a hole to drill..."

312
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,111
What do you mean,
how would I get in?

313
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:21,650
Through the coal bin, of course.

314
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,940
The apartment is vacant.
An unsplit inheritance,

315
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,693
the usual formalities,
legalities, courts proceedings.

316
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,915
Vacant, understand?
While here I am, locked up.

317
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,672
Where is it?

318
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,725
Via delle Madonne.

319
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,487
You know what I say?

320
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:43,730
What?

321
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,486
Sounds like a good sting.

322
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:48,782
I like it.

323
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,097
Where are you going?

324
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,156
I got a year... on probation.
All my best. See you!

325
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,793
Drop dead, you cowardly scumbag!

326
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:03,240
The news traveled fast.

327
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:06,421
Capannelle!

328
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,083
What's going on?

329
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:11,719
-He's getting out.
-What?

330
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,345
-He's getting out.
-Who? Cosimo?

331
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:16,706
No, Peppe. He's got to give us
back the money now.

332
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:19,279
For sure, or we'll beat him up.

333
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,810
You tell Tiberio.
I'll tell Ferribotte. See ya!

334
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,252
Leave it to me!

335
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,664
Who's there?

336
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,068
Michele. I forgot my keys.

337
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:00,342
But you're pretty.

338
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,699
I heard you never get out
'cause you're ugly.

339
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:07,941
I don't know you. Leave. Michele
is due back any minute now.

340
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,624
I hope so. I have something very
important to tell him.

341
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,822
But first I'll tell him I'm going
to turn him in for kidnapping...

342
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:19,602
I understand keeping a girl
under lock and key in Sicily.

343
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,115
There's nowhere to go there!

344
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,994
Nothing but rocks
and cacti down there...

345
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,779
Cactus is probably what grows
in your backyard!

346
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:30,295
I wish. Only mushrooms there!
I live in a basement.

347
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,601
It serves you right,
talking that way about Sicily!

348
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:36,296
Just joking. My name is Mario.
Mario Angeletti. And yours?

349
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,722
Carmela.

350
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:41,734
You don't say! All Sicilian women
are called Carmela. But tell me...

351
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,882
do you really like being always
locked up in the house?

352
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,569
Sometimes I get out.
I go to the graveyard.

353
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,862
That's fun for sure.

354
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,670
I visit my mother.

355
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,751
I'm a real ass, sorry!

356
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,483
It's all right. And your mother,
is she still with you?

357
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,477
-What?
-Is she alive?

358
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:09,057
Oh, yes, yes, for sure she is.

359
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,673
Michele! Hurry!

360
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:25,416
Carmela, get decent.
Your fiance is here.

361
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,022
I am presentable.

362
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:35,526
Come in.

363
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:38,493
May l? Good morning.

364
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,253
See if there is any coffee.

365
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,270
This question of the mattresses
doesn't add up.

366
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,361
My mother says it's up to the bride.

367
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:56,924
What about the reception?!

368
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,713
Reception and banquet, we split.

369
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,226
There's another question
my mother wants cleared.

370
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:03,586
She doesn't understand
what business you're in.

371
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,072
What's that got to do with it?
I'm... I'm a citrus fruit salesman.

372
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:09,744
-Citrus? Would that be the company?
-I'm sorry.

373
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:12,902
What's that?

374
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:15,815
You wait here, I get this.

375
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:26,064
-Desiderio...
-What?

376
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:28,191
-Come with me.
-Fine.

377
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:39,530
-Wait here.
-All right.

378
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:44,256
They're releasing Peppe the boxer.
We've gotta get our money back.

379
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,242
God, I run like crazy...
I'm all out of breath.

380
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:10,059
How are you doing, troublemaker?

381
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,053
Fine.

382
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,921
Out with the money.

383
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,641
Why? What money.

384
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,023
Can't you remember why I got it?

385
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,104
To go in, instead of Cosimo, right?

386
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,400
Right, you'll book a bed in the ER,

387
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,087
'cause we're sending you
straight there.

388
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:35,694
You're tough. Four against one?

389
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:37,418
Yeah, but we'll beat you up
just once!

390
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:39,944
Why?
You should be happy to see me.

391
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,077
Wait a minute, wait. Easy.

392
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,094
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

393
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,697
What is it you want?

394
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:51,465
I'm... I'm... in charge of the deal...

395
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,294
Cosimo told me.

396
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,547
What are you doing with that
bottle? Put it down!

397
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:57,160
What do you mean,
Cosimo told you?

398
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,043
Sure he did. The sting,
we'll tackle it together.

399
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:03,208
I... I was coming to see you.
No need for... watch it...

400
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:05,785
You're a sly one, aren't you?

401
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,729
Fine, fine. Forget it and let's get
down to... Cut it out.

402
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,472
That's the baby's biscuits.

403
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,788
You're all so suspicious
I shouldn't tell you a thing.

404
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:19,194
Fine. Prick up your ears.
To pull this one off, we've gotta

405
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,719
 prepare
everything beforehand,

406
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,289
calculate everything scientifically.

407
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,689
-Do you remember Via delle Madonne?
-Yeah.

408
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,960
Well, there's a pawnshop there.
Know it?

409
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,226
Sure I do!
They even got my sheets there.

410
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:32,046
We're not talking about sheets now.
We're talking jewelry.

411
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:34,572
You're not thinking of breaking in,
then and there,

412
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:36,181
in the middle of the street?

413
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:39,009
Of course not! We'll get there
through a vacant apartment.

414
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:43,639
There - those are the windows.
Right?

415
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:46,790
And that's the door.

416
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,822
-Picklock?
-No. No lock picking,

417
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,940
we'd be exposed for too long.

418
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:52,571
There's a safer way.
Follow me.

419
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,516
Over there, on the right,
see the coal bin?

420
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:04,106
We'll go in through there.

421
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:05,302
And where do we come out?

422
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:08,749
I'll explain later. Capannelle,
pretend to tie your shoelaces

423
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,307
and check out that padlock.

424
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,773
My shoes don't have laces.

425
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,430
Fine. Ferribotte, please.

426
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:29,885
8 mm pliers will do.

427
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:33,242
There. From the coal bin
we come out there...

428
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:35,909
go down...

429
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:40,390
take that stairway, see?

430
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:44,349
Then up through the roof.

431
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:47,644
Another little iron ladder this time.

432
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:51,095
And from there, up to the terrace.
Just like an elevator.

433
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:52,329
-What then?
-Wait:

434
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,095
move over so
you can see well.

435
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:56,668
There, did you get to the terrace?

436
00:27:56,848 --> 00:27:57,876
I hope so.

437
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:00,890
Now we go across the skylight-

438
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,782
quietly, everybody's asleep,
nobody hears us-

439
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:09,751
and we get to that window,
the one with the bars.

440
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:13,228
What do you see there?

441
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,812
The crib... The crib!

442
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:20,826
Sure, but you must be crazy.
Sawing the bars?

443
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:26,723
Who said anything about sawing?
Look at that window... on the left...

444
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,311
Well?

445
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:32,250
Well, I told you it's a walk
in the park.

446
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:38,607
So? That's the vacant apartment's
window. Look, there it is.

447
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:43,229
We go in... there's a partition wall
that's a pushover...

448
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:45,411
and there we are: crib's room.

449
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:47,494
Nice and easy with
those millions waiting for us.

450
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,695
-What? Millions?
-Millions!

451
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:50,123
Quiet!

452
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:54,178
Capannelle though,
he can't come with us.

453
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,732
-Why not?
-Look at you, dressed that way!

454
00:28:59,042 --> 00:28:59,776
Sportswear.

455
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:01,732
Sportswear, my ass!
You're in thief's uniform!

456
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:04,541
-You'll have us arrested that way!
-We'll end up in jail for sure.

457
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,445
How do we open the safe?
A magic combination?

458
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:07,904
What kind of photographer
are you?

459
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:08,859
So what?

460
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,436
It follows. To everybody, the job
he's best suited for.

461
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:13,753
That's how the 'scientific'
method works.

462
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:16,838
You set up here,

463
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,908
with your camera and that thing...

464
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:19,937
The telephoto lens.

465
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,405
Yes, that one. Wait for
the employee to open the safe

466
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,522
and snap his every move.

467
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:27,003
Then we call a safe expert.

468
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:28,716
Dante Cruciani is the best.

469
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:31,765
Dante Cruciani, for instance. We'll
show him the film, and that's it.

470
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:32,992
Great idea!

471
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,509
By the way, my camera is gone.

472
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:37,861
At Porta Portese they
have all the cameras you need.

473
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:38,916
But I'm flat broke!

474
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,484
Were you thinking of buying it?

475
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:42,624
Just work with me. We'll handle it.

476
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:52,276
You're bound to make a good
impression on your cousin

477
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,619
with this painting. Don't you think?

478
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:57,268
Well, I really couldn't say...

479
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:01,182
See, see here, it has depth to it.
See this tree here.

480
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,376
It's a very tasteful gift.
Genteel, almost.

481
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,780
This cypress shooting up
into the sky,

482
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:11,578
the pleasantness of the countryside,
the ducks, the pretty dame?

483
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,747
And, look, signed by Raphael.

484
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:16,944
Yes, but Raphael de Santis...

485
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:19,548
For a thousand lira, what do you
want? A real Raphael?

486
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,660
Well. I wouldn't know,

487
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:23,915
but a gift should always be
the best one can pick.

488
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:26,683
Come now.
For a thousand lira, it's a... steal.

489
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,050
That's true.

490
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:45,720
Cute, these aprons.
Let me have three.

491
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:47,326
For my mother they're just fine.

492
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,120
-All three of them?
-Yes, those three alike.

493
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,407
The ones with Donald Duck.

494
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,361
I got it.

495
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,467
Shut up and pay attention.
There's the safe.

496
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:04,647
The crib!

497
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,996
Quiet, I have to focus it.
I was trying to focus it.

498
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:09,302
It's moving.
I was setting up the shot...

499
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:12,656
It's all blurred.

500
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,937
Well kids, the camera is old,
the lens is old,

501
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:16,381
this ain't Hollywood, you know.

502
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:19,093
-And who's the kid?
-Who is it?

503
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,610
-It's my kid, I shot a few trial
frames at home. -He's cute!

504
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:22,691
-Really cute!
-Cutie!

505
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,518
But he's crying.
Why is he crying so much?

506
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:27,176
Daddy's boy!
Look what a close up he got.

507
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,802
Look closely, now he gets up...
goes to the safe... look closely...

508
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:33,334
Watch what he's doing now...
and see what a shot I got!

509
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:39,976
We've even got the pants
in the shot.

510
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:42,636
Filming the underpants adds to the
shot... What did you do? Go on!

511
00:31:42,787 --> 00:31:43,932
You're wasting our time.

512
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:47,215
It can happen. Now it's coming up
again. Shut up. Here it is.

513
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,927
What did you do?

514
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:50,363
I shot it in over two days.

515
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:52,165
-Cute.
-The kid, does he cry all the time?

516
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:53,567
Who cares about the kid, really!

517
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:55,628
-And who's this guy?
-The bartender.

518
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,606
Who gives a damn about
the bartender?

519
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:59,951
I wasn't the one to send for coffee,
you know!

520
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:03,156
There's a lady coming in now
with a watch. She puts it down,

521
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,196
he picks it up, takes it to the safe.
Here she comes, see?

522
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:09,688
-Hey, look, it's your watch Capanne'.
-What?

523
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:14,635
Quiet, now he gives her the receipt.
There. See, now?

524
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,064
Watch carefully now.
Here it comes.

525
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:18,310
It's skipping.

526
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,063
It skips because it's old;
we got it at Porta Portese.

527
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,886
The combination, watch it, watch...

528
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,515
-All the money we've invested!
-Money? I stole it!

529
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:41,653
Be quiet...
So Dante, what do you think?

530
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:52,019
-As a movie? It's lousy.
-Thanks a lot!

531
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,201
-Did you hear that?
-Sure I did.

532
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:57,193
But what I got to see,
it's better than nothing at all.

533
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:01,014
So... The safe:
it's a Commodoro 50 model,

534
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:03,005
and not a particularly
difficult one.

535
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:04,433
It's in the bag then!

536
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:06,471
Who's that? Ferribotte?

537
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,449
Ah, the job at Foro Pancrazio,
via Merulana, 1952?

538
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:12,165
No, I didn't get the honor.

539
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:16,065
'Til last year I was in plumbing
with Armando Lucherini.

540
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:19,941
Ah, little Armando, he knows
the tools of his trade, all right.

541
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:20,981
And so?

542
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:27,040
Well, boys, it's 50,000
for my services.

543
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:28,468
-Are we understood?
-Oh, God.

544
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:29,945
-What did he just say?
-Exorbitant.

545
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:31,846
-And in advance!
-Fifty thousand!

546
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:40,384
So it was up to Mario to come up
with the money.

547
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,598
Mario, it's you!

548
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:14,744
Ada!

549
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:15,814
How are things?

550
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:16,903
Not too bad.

551
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,593
Ada, come see who's here.

552
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,736
Mario's here!

553
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,555
Hi, my beautiful big mamma.
How are you?

554
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:24,628
Fine, and you?

555
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:25,589
Fine, fine.

556
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,383
Let me look at you.
How ugly you've become...

557
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:29,555
What do you mean 'ugly'?

558
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:30,949
Assunta. Assunta.

559
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:32,383
I bet you Mario's here.

560
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:36,681
I knew it. There he is. Mario!

561
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:39,788
Ciao, my beautiful big mamma.

562
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,745
You're looking good.

563
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:45,523
Let's take another look.
You look so run down.

564
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:47,803
-No.
-Sure you are. You're so run down.

565
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:50,519
What do you mean 'run down'?
He doesn't look it to me.

566
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,264
-The last one to see you, right?
-Hi, mom.

567
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:54,917
-I need to have a word with you.
-How are you?

568
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,981
-Are you back?
-Quiet, don't shout.

569
00:34:57,118 --> 00:35:00,797
-Take off your coats.
-Wash your hands.

570
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:03,626
What did he tell her?
That he wants to have a word?

571
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:05,600
Why her?
Don't we count for anything?

572
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,616
-Did something happen?
-No.

573
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,679
He says he's here
for his bank book.

574
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:19,522
I need some money to buy a coat.
I'm cold.

575
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:21,542
We'll take care of it.

576
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:24,071
The countess will give us one
of her capes.

577
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,443
She's got a storage room full.

578
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:28,858
Can you picture me in one of those
capes? I've had enough of them.

579
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:32,386
He's right. Mario is a man now,
and he needs a real coat.

580
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:37,332
When are they going
to get new ones?

581
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:40,017
This here is the hole I made
to hide my cigarettes in!

582
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:44,196
Now, tell me, Mario...
You're not unemployed, are you?

583
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:48,208
No, I work... now and then,
but I work.

584
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:51,222
Why is it you can't get
a steady job?

585
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:52,973
You're a certified cabinetmaker.

586
00:35:53,305 --> 00:35:55,062
Right, certified.

587
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:58,205
I know what it is. He's ashamed to
show the diploma he got from here.

588
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:03,605
Why does it have to say
'orphanage'... charitable institution?

589
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,671
What kind of a diploma is that?
It's like being branded a son of a...

590
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:11,413
Mario, listen. We'll lend you
the money for the coat,

591
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:13,549
but you're keeping your hands off
your savings.

592
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:16,963
No, in that case I'll do without it.

593
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:24,695
Of all the brats that pass
through here,

594
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,303
why am I the only one
you put up with?

595
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:33,158
Don't worry,
I'll put the money back.

596
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,841
I have some friends,
and if all goes well

597
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,879
I'll take all three of you
away from here.

598
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:49,241
Every safe is a thing unto itself.

599
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:52,657
Some have crossed bars,

600
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,105
some are triangular,
and others circular.

601
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,045
All of them, however,
are made so that the lock

602
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:00,657
doesn't have
any openings around it.

603
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:02,701
Hey, what are you doing? Eating?

604
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:06,647
Just pay a little attention, right?
You can eat during recess.

605
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:12,306
Now, one way to opening them
is by using dynamite.

606
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,534
The system preferred by the
famous fu Cimin.

607
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:18,143
Fu-Ci-Min?
Who is he? A Chinese guy?

608
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:19,818
What Chinese? He was Venetian.

609
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,996
Fo means... 'the late',
Cimin is his surname, see?

610
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:26,234
The poor guy got blown up
with the safe.

611
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:31,536
Therefore, I'm ruling out
this method outright, O.K.?

612
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:37,705
-So let's carry on. As I was saying...
-Dante Cruciani? Checking on you.

613
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,927
Oh poor me, the cops, the cops...

614
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:43,011
Here I am, sergeant.

615
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,753
Rascals! Scoundrels!

616
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,878
If I catch one of them
I'll beat him black and blue!

617
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:55,270
Rascals!
They almost gave me a heart attack.

618
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,188
I thought it was unlikely.
He did stop by yesterday.

619
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,233
Right, listen here... Most safes
have three or four locks.

620
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,962
Only one matters, though.

621
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,589
And now do we know
which one it is?

622
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,403
How do you know, eh? Drill
a little hole and insert a pipe!

623
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:11,375
I see...

624
00:38:11,642 --> 00:38:13,577
-You fill the safe with water...
-Water?

625
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:15,534
...from the lock that... water, water...

626
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:19,556
from the lock that spills
the watery... liquid... let's say...

627
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:21,253
that's the good one.

628
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,314
-But, is it practical?
-No.

629
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:25,533
Guys, let's clarify one thing
right now.

630
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:28,795
No method is 100 percent sure
when dealing with safes.

631
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:34,105
There's one and only one guarantee:
the circular saw.

632
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:37,973
And now let's move on to some
practical exercise

633
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,624
with a dummy safe...

634
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:48,556
Here we are. See all these holes?
These are all timings studied by me.

635
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:55,215
Watch it now.
Fu Cimin system... dynamite...

636
00:38:58,523 --> 00:39:02,360
Notice the perfection, and
the diameter of this orifice here,

637
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:04,545
one hour and fifteen minutes!

638
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:05,556
Right! Right...

639
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:10,950
In those times! Industrially
powered saw, fifty kilos of metal.

640
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,189
Right, goodbye!

641
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:14,382
No, no... no, absolutely out
of the question.

642
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:20,291
Well, look at this other hole,
Wolgemut, German, handsaw.

643
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,339
With a lot of elbow grease
you might swing it in three hours.

644
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:27,539
Have you got three hours?

645
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,372
Tonight we're sorting out
the watches

646
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:33,408
to study the movements
in the building,

647
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:36,791
the store's hours,
very scientific you know.

648
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,459
Still, we should have
three hours clean.

649
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:44,425
Now let's go ahead with the job...
in corpore vili...

650
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,586
 You!

651
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:48,322
Take the oil can and lubricate.

652
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:53,456
Lubrication must be continuous
and uninterrupted.

653
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:55,863
I'd rather not get mixed up
with these technicalities...

654
00:39:56,014 --> 00:39:59,933
Dante Cruciani. Checking on you.

655
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:03,871
Rascals. If I catch one of them
I'll make him black and blue.

656
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:07,107
Ready? Go ahead. All ready?

657
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,440
It's 5:35 pm.

658
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,690
You tell us tomorrow.

659
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:11,049
I'm going, O.K.?

660
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,258
Dad, dad the sergeant is here.

661
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:18,830
Oh, God, God I'm done for.
Hide the safe.

662
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:22,808
Cruciani! Where are you?

663
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,685
Cruciani! Are you there?

664
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:33,566
Boys! What's up?

665
00:40:34,128 --> 00:40:35,892
It's the pretty ladies' soap...

666
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,891
-Hello, Sarge.
-Sarge, how are you?

667
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:44,463
Hello, Sarge, just doing
a little laundry, see?

668
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,698
Excuse me, have you got a match?

669
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,701
You could have showed up
a little earlier.

670
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:06,762
You know I've got the kid,
damn it!

671
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:11,915
The doorman opens up at six,
then he cleans the stairway,

672
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,294
starting from the top floor.

673
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:18,056
The pawnshop opens at eight...
Thanks.

674
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:24,881
Listen here. The tobacconist opens
at 8 am too.

675
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,940
Gimme back my matches.

676
00:41:27,669 --> 00:41:29,724
Take this... cutie!

677
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:34,856
Nicoletta! Nicoletta!

678
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,829
Buy two bars of butter!

679
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:39,653
If you don't have enough money
tell them to put it on the account.

680
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:40,743
But hurry!

681
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,336
Isn't that our apartment?

682
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:44,951
Yes, and there are people in it.

683
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:47,558
It's over.

684
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:53,010
It was a tough set back, but
our heroes didn't give up.

685
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:56,446
The owners are two old spinsters.
They never leave the house.

686
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:58,027
That's really good news.

687
00:41:58,178 --> 00:42:00,233
You shut your mouth!
Kept watch all day

688
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,617
and didn't notice a thing!

689
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:05,506
But every Thursday they go to
oversee their vineyards in Genzano.

690
00:42:05,684 --> 00:42:06,956
Leaving the house unattended?

691
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,588
No, the little maid stays back.

692
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:09,764
And she's hot.

693
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,960
I got it, I got it.
Whenever there's a pretty girl,

694
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,749
sooner or later, Peppe
finds his way in.

695
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,253
Such apples, such apples!
Sweet like molasses!

696
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:39,052
Ehi, do you remember this song?
Miss? Miss, may I carry your bags?

697
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:40,264
Ehi, she's dumb.

698
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:42,679
No, she's not, right?
You can't just leave. Listen.

699
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:43,818
You're gorgeous!

700
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:45,931
If you don't leave now,
I'll smash you with my bag!

701
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:47,648
She is sour and... sweet.

702
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:49,416
Leave me alone
or I'll call the police.

703
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,609
Good, so we get locked up
together.

704
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:54,107
Well? What's this?

705
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:59,451
Where do you live?
This is a civilized country!

706
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:00,888
This is none of your business.

707
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,154
Shame on you!

708
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:03,490
See you!

709
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:09,432
Mother of God!

710
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,461
You bully! Let me go,
you're breaking my arm.

711
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:13,364
This hurts!
Good God, I'm sorry!

712
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:16,337
What are you doing? He wasn't
doing anything! Let them go!

713
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:17,594
Just go, quickly!

714
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:19,125
Let's go, let's go, he's strong!

715
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:24,148
-D'you hurt 'em, poor things?
-They deserved it.

716
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,476
May l?
Pierluigi Capannelle, accountant.

717
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,169
Are you from up North too?

718
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,117
-Padua... well, I really must go now.
-Why?

719
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:34,990
My fiance is waiting. He's off duty.

720
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:38,160
He's a captain, but next month he'll
be promoted lieutenant. Goodbye.

721
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:50,828
Miss, miss!

722
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:54,331
Could I see you again?

723
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:57,589
What? Not today. I'm expecting
my fiance from Brescia...

724
00:43:58,112 --> 00:43:59,738
I say! How many
fiances have you got?

725
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:00,824
Three.

726
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:06,401
And with all... all your workload...
you find time for all three of them?

727
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:08,007
What workload?

728
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:11,750
Well... your shopping.
Don't you go shopping?

729
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:15,133
I do it because it's fun,
I lend my aunts a hand,

730
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:16,360
as I'm staying with them.

731
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:18,601
You see, my father's a colonel.

732
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,272
Ah, I see, all in the army then?

733
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:26,576
No, my father is... what d'you
call it? In the alpine corps.

734
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:29,851
The alpine corps. Good, good.
In the North we're,

735
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:32,370
we're all in the alpine corps, right?

736
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:34,913
Hello.

737
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:39,731
It's only that, when
you're a salesman

738
00:44:39,863 --> 00:44:43,062
traveling all the time,
your accent gets contaminated.

739
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:44,580
But traveling is so nice, right?

740
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:49,318
Right, but putting down roots too.
Me, I am a gypsy.

741
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,668
It's ugly Miss, you know,
to be lonely, defenseless...

742
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,820
Defenseless yes,
but you're nice and strong right?

743
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:02,314
Well, yes... I do train.

744
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:04,798
You're not a boxer, right?
So gruesome...

745
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:10,095
No, no, no! What boxing!
Tennis, golf, polo...

746
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,424
I say, you know how to punch
even without having learned to box.

747
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:15,914
That's not it; those two
were two dirty low lives.

748
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:20,713
No... no... it's not like I despise
the lower classes.

749
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,368
I like them a lot. Actually,
the lower the better.

750
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,401
...I like... I like maids too...

751
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,619
Good!

752
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:34,311
Let's say you were a maid.
I would like you all the same.

753
00:45:34,614 --> 00:45:36,241
That is so generous of you.

754
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,130
Nicoletta! Nicoletta!
What are you doing?

755
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:39,265
Coming.

756
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,366
Who's that?

757
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:46,239
He's... he's my boyfriend's
attendant... Goodbye.

758
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:47,898
Could... could we meet tomorrow?

759
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:51,553
No, not tomorrow. Sunday, four
o'clock, here. Right? Goodbye.

760
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:57,607
So, what's up with that one?

761
00:45:57,936 --> 00:45:59,731
-Nothing. He's my cousin.
-Right. Your cousin!

762
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:02,131
Let's go so you can give me a hand
with the shopping.

763
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:06,578
But Peppe and his friends didn't
take into account that now

764
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:10,096
and then in Italy
there's a general pardon...

765
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,973
Steer.

766
00:46:37,401 --> 00:46:41,914
Kid, come here... let me in...
follow that car...

767
00:46:45,162 --> 00:46:46,612
Enough!

768
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:50,501
Go, that one, go, c'mon.
There it is... bump it!

769
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,981
Hurry! There he is, run him down!

770
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,623
Get off, you rotter! Get off!

771
00:47:05,852 --> 00:47:08,502
If you wanna speak with me,
get an appointment.

772
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:09,913
Appointment?

773
00:47:10,071 --> 00:47:11,848
Get your hands off me! Get lost!
Go away!

774
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:15,165
I'll give you the appointment!
Coward, come out!

775
00:47:15,356 --> 00:47:16,691
Move Nicoletta! Leave me alone!

776
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:17,732
Nicoletta! Here, grab!

777
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,169
Where are you running off to?

778
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,703
What are you doing? It's loaded!

779
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:24,020
Stop! You coward!

780
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,639
Mind! There are live caps in it.

781
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,505
Don't move! I'll kill you, you know!

782
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,588
Are you crazy? You're blinding me!

783
00:47:33,247 --> 00:47:34,580
Cosimo, stop! What are you doing?

784
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:36,503
You get out of the way.
You went off with him!

785
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:38,866
-Do you want to compromise yourself?
-Stop it! Let me go!

786
00:47:39,017 --> 00:47:40,702
-Cosimo, don't play the fool.
-A fool?

787
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:42,395
St...stay with us.
Let's work together.

788
00:47:42,546 --> 00:47:44,097
-With you?
-We are all friends, right?

789
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:45,247
Shut your mouth, slut!

790
00:47:45,398 --> 00:47:47,161
-Get lost! You old man!
-Old man?

791
00:47:47,312 --> 00:47:49,879
-You're old and you're acting all
cocky! -You're calling me old?

792
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,075
Careful, or I'm going to kill you,
you know!

793
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,125
Cosimo, I don't bear any grudges,

794
00:48:13,735 --> 00:48:15,143
if you wanna stay with us

795
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:17,205
and get your share.

796
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:29,137
Cosimo, he never just got his slice.

797
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,392
Well, then, I'm sorry,

798
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:34,771
but here we follow Menga's laws.

799
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,224
You're a dirty bunch.

800
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:04,375
Who is it?

801
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:07,458
Michele, I forgot my keys.

802
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:15,522
Just a moment...

803
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,634
This'll teach you a lesson
for next time.

804
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:29,603
Ah, it'll teach me a lesson, eh?
While you...

805
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:33,055
-Come closer, I want to ask you something.
-What?

806
00:49:34,335 --> 00:49:36,833
I want to tell you that I don't like
you marrying that peasant.

807
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,369
How dare you!

808
00:49:43,592 --> 00:49:47,837
God, this hurts! God, God, God...

809
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,142
-Did I hurt you?
-Yes...

810
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:03,027
Meanwhile Cosimo was thinking of
revenge:. Peppe and his friends

811
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:07,601
would not enjoy the fruit
of their betrayal.

812
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:42,997
We're closed.

813
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:44,257
Just a moment.

814
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:48,839
Here you go, ma'am.

815
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,200
Do you know it?

816
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:09,217
Sure I know it. It's a small caliber
Baretta, in very poor condition.

817
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:10,767
One thousand lira.

818
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:14,399
Well?

819
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:08,073
-Wanna dance?
-No. I've taken a pledge.

820
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:19,939
Well... maybe... you like me
'cause you're an extrovert,

821
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:23,332
my opposite.

822
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:27,615
I, on the other hand, internalize.

823
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,778
Maybe 'cause I've always been
alone, I've suffered a lot in my life.

824
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:39,107
Happiness is like a flower that,
you p-p-pluck only once.

825
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:45,213
Listen, why don't we get out
of here,

826
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:48,650
I'd love to be alone
with you for a bit.

827
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:49,710
Oh, poor devil!

828
00:52:50,725 --> 00:52:53,955
Why? It's only so
we can talk better.

829
00:52:54,287 --> 00:52:59,023
To get to know each other.
Any place will do.

830
00:52:59,313 --> 00:53:06,253
Your place, my place.
It doesn't matter.

831
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:08,156
-My place? -Yes.
-What about my aunts?

832
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:11,884
You're contradicting yourself
You're not all that clear then!

833
00:53:12,483 --> 00:53:15,293
I'm sorry but you said that your
...aunts leave now and then,

834
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:17,167
and they leave the house
unattended...

835
00:53:17,332 --> 00:53:18,193
Yes, it's true.

836
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:24,895
So what? No. Let's be honest from
day one. Otherwise suspicion,

837
00:53:25,046 --> 00:53:27,451
the real kiss of death for love,
seeps in.

838
00:53:27,602 --> 00:53:30,505
Slow down, who said love?
It's all in your head.

839
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:32,242
If you really want to know,

840
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,164
I've also asked
Guido and Fernando here.

841
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,278
Them too!

842
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:38,329
I'm a well brought up girl
you know!

843
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:41,494
I can't go dancing with one guy
only. It would compromise me.

844
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:45,589
What you need to learn is that you
must date me and me alone.

845
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:47,445
I date whom I please.

846
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:50,680
-Hello, Guido.
-Hi!

847
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,667
-Hi!
-Where are you going?

848
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,635
Let go of me.
Leave me alone. Don't be rude.

849
00:53:54,844 --> 00:53:57,301
Fine, but remember that
I don't take anybody back,

850
00:53:57,659 --> 00:53:58,586
not even with apologies.

851
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:00,287
What do I care?

852
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:12,412
What a tramp!

853
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:17,239
She's playing hard to get?

854
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:20,175
She's not worth the bother.

855
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:28,352
Listen Peppe, believe me,
let's leave it.

856
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,087
It started like nothing, and now
it's blown out of proportion.

857
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:35,214
Damn her!

858
00:54:43,175 --> 00:54:46,023
Don't you agree?
I'm talking to you!

859
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:47,943
What do you want?
Leave me alone!

860
00:54:51,945 --> 00:54:54,728
This jerk! He gets all worked up
about it. You were playing so cool.

861
00:54:55,147 --> 00:54:57,057
Have you fallen in love
with that maid?

862
00:54:58,185 --> 00:54:59,079
Those two, l...

863
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,069
-Come here!
-Move,

864
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:06,207
and you get out of the way!

865
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:07,537
Ah, here again?

866
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:10,979
You're cute, aren't you?

867
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,668
What are you laughing at?

868
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:16,323
What? Since when is laughing
forbidden? It's Mardis Gras!

869
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:19,357
And any joke is good, right?

870
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:26,234
Anyway, I am partner at a...
at a funeral home, right?

871
00:55:31,442 --> 00:55:33,041
And I am his partner.

872
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:37,198
Well, share this one then!

873
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,939
Oh, God!

874
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:01,742
Oh, our Lady!

875
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:07,160
Have you gone insane!
For that tramp of a peasant!

876
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:09,417
If there's a tramp here, that's you.
Don't even know you!

877
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:12,443
Ah, you don't know me?
But I know you.

878
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,199
-Colonel's daughter all right!
-Let's go, c'mon.

879
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,763
You're a servant,
that's what you are!

880
00:56:16,914 --> 00:56:18,114
-Who? Who's a servant?
-You!

881
00:56:18,265 --> 00:56:19,804
Please, stop it!

882
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:31,655
-They've disfigured me.
-Would you cut it out? You've spoiled it!

883
00:56:31,951 --> 00:56:33,140
Let's see, you owe me

884
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:36,055
four sodas, six Coca Colas,
two cream sodas and one beer.

885
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:39,661
What do you say?
Did I drink it all?

886
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,658
Not drank, smashed.

887
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,077
Wait a minute...

888
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:46,264
there're also two glasses,
one chair and an ashtray.

889
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,154
-When?
-It's all written here!

890
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,646
You're telling me?

891
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:55,520
Fine, fine, I'll pay...
Right now I don't have any cash...

892
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:56,928
Send me the bill home, right?

893
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,735
-Fine, what's your name?
-What?

894
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,165
What's your name?

895
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:06,433
Capannelle, Capannelle Pierluigi,
Circonvallazione Latina 457.

896
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:08,397
Four, five, seven.

897
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:13,350
What do you want?

898
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:16,248
Let me see.

899
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:19,762
-I don't know you...
-C'mon...

900
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:22,805
This is bad.

901
00:57:23,061 --> 00:57:25,858
'This is bad'?
It's all your fault!

902
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:26,922
-Mine?
-Sure.

903
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:29,197
And that one, who was she?

904
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:33,831
Well, one of my conquests.

905
00:57:35,054 --> 00:57:37,476
She saw you with me and,
and she got jealous.

906
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:43,605
Do you, do you believe what
she said about me?

907
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:45,512
Well...

908
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:48,387
No.

909
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:59,567
Well, it's true...
I work as domestic help.

910
00:58:03,861 --> 00:58:07,506
What does it matter? We're a
democratic country, are we not?

911
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,697
But I won't do the laundry!

912
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:15,083
Easy...

913
00:58:18,872 --> 00:58:20,247
-Better?
-No.

914
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:25,027
Still, this is the last time
I go out with you. -Why?

915
00:58:25,185 --> 00:58:28,050
Why? You fight in the street,
at the amusement park, at the dance...

916
00:58:28,826 --> 00:58:30,597
It's better if we do
it your way, then.

917
00:58:31,483 --> 00:58:32,433
My way?

918
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:34,195
We go to my place.

919
00:58:35,404 --> 00:58:36,945
-To... to your place?!
-Yes...

920
00:58:38,555 --> 00:58:39,398
This way? Right now?

921
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,936
Not right now. Those ones,
my mistresses, aren't home.

922
00:58:43,246 --> 00:58:44,801
Thursday night, they'll leave
for Genzano

923
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:46,292
and will be back the morning after.

924
00:58:46,512 --> 00:58:48,105
Is that right? Great! Great!

925
00:58:48,387 --> 00:58:49,831
-I'll make you dinner, right?
-Thanks.

926
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:51,693
Oh, God  it hurts.
Don't make me laugh!

927
00:58:51,847 --> 00:58:53,211
Don't make me laugh!

928
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:56,173
But at the same time...

929
00:59:57,413 --> 00:59:59,672
Help... help! stop, thief.
Help! Let go of me!

930
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:02,520
I'm not a thief! What do you want?

931
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,731
Stop. thief... help!... Low life!

932
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:11,263
Stop, thief, he's stolen my handbag!

933
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:25,586
Today good news,

934
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,844
to... tomorrow bad... Oh, well!

935
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:35,178
Right it's like the proverb says:
feast or famine.

936
01:00:40,065 --> 01:00:41,211
-Hi, Mario.
-Hi.

937
01:00:50,326 --> 01:00:52,197
He looks as though
he were sleeping.

938
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:54,228
Aren't you going in?

939
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:58,419
No. I prefer to remember him alive.

940
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:00,454
I'm going.

941
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:02,650
Wait...

942
01:01:08,104 --> 01:01:09,157
Here!

943
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:16,250
He'd been going down the slippery
slope for a while, poor Cosimo!

944
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:20,620
A professional like him stooping
down to muggings... that's kid's stuff!

945
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,482
The best ones are always
first to go.

946
01:01:24,093 --> 01:01:26,547
That's life. Today is your turn,
tomorrow's his.

947
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,617
Right, and sooner or later
we all have to go!

948
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:33,400
As far as I am concerned,
better later than sooner.

949
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,201
-Hi.
-Hi.

950
01:01:41,334 --> 01:01:43,307
-Hi.
-Poor sod.

951
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:45,937
What's this?
You show up with the kid?

952
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:47,501
What am I supposed to do?

953
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:49,389
He cries all the time,
this is fun for him.

954
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:53,577
Fine, but it's time for you
to park him somewhere.

955
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:54,765
Why?

956
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:58,469
It's on for tomorrow night.

957
01:01:58,677 --> 01:01:59,528
Tomorrow night?

958
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:01,089
Right, the owners'll be away,

959
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:02,420
and the girl is letting me in.

960
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,498
How can we? With the dead
still fresh in the grave?

961
01:02:04,649 --> 01:02:06,244
What do you observe?
Strict mourning?

962
01:02:06,395 --> 01:02:09,135
As the saying goes: you're dead
but they're still dancing.

963
01:02:09,286 --> 01:02:10,566
Fine, right... you're right...

964
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:14,247
I'm sorry about Cosimo, still...
It's his fault too,

965
01:02:14,983 --> 01:02:16,854
yes... yes...
if he'd only listened to me...

966
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:20,274
-C'mon... here.
-Guys, the chief of police!

967
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:22,569
Scram.

968
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:29,404
The big day.

969
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,472
Who's that? Look,
it's Teresa's baby!

970
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,423
What's up?
She didn't want him in here?

971
01:02:37,574 --> 01:02:40,415
Poor love! That husband of hers
is a fine looking guy, really!

972
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,680
It's Teresa's baby! He's so gorgeous!
Come here... come...

973
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:49,551
Shut up! Calm down.
Hold it. Shut up!

974
01:02:52,474 --> 01:02:53,759
-Look who's here.
-Hi.

975
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:56,592
Hi.

976
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,922
-How are you?
-Well so-so... and you?

977
01:03:00,124 --> 01:03:01,880
Not too bad. Here.

978
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:03,450
Poor darling!

979
01:03:06,508 --> 01:03:09,496
Listen here. Didn't I tell you
I didn't want him inside?

980
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:11,736
-It's on for tonight.
-Right.

981
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,118
In case something might happen,
it shouldn't though, eh...

982
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,653
Knowing you,
it will happen for sure.

983
01:03:15,784 --> 01:03:17,136
Teresa!

984
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,689
What's up with this creature?

985
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,168
Is he doing it? Doing it regularly?

986
01:03:22,568 --> 01:03:25,106
-For sure! Even three times a day!
-Three times a day?!

987
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:27,169
There's something wrong then,
poor little star!

988
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,964
I say: isn't it that to save time
you've been feeding him your food?

989
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:33,671
No, more like the opposite,
I've been eating his baby food...

990
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:35,972
One spoon for you, one for me.
One for you, one for me...

991
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:36,997
I've lost four pounds!

992
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:39,719
Ah, poor love! I'd like to know...

993
01:03:39,855 --> 01:03:41,758
How have you dressed
this poor creature?

994
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:43,555
And these underpants,
whose are they?

995
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:44,562
They're mine.

996
01:03:44,713 --> 01:03:46,552
I haven't even had the time
to do the laundry.

997
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,988
Actually, here, these two little rags
need to be washed.

998
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:50,073
This too!?

999
01:03:50,224 --> 01:03:52,378
Here, the biscuits, here,
the baby food.

1000
01:03:53,194 --> 01:03:55,864
Careful, the vitamins
are in the sugar can.

1001
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:57,664
And the sugar in the talc can.

1002
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:00,728
-Home is such a mess!
-I believe you!

1003
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:02,589
There, fine.

1004
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:05,512
See you.
Listen, if it turns out all right,

1005
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:08,438
get me a new mattress
for when I get home,

1006
01:04:08,697 --> 01:04:10,784
I'm dying to sleep on a proper bed!

1007
01:04:11,395 --> 01:04:12,450
Not to sleep with me, eh?

1008
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:15,235
Sure, sure, of course!
Sure I want to sleep with you,

1009
01:04:15,386 --> 01:04:17,639
still, take care of that mattress.
Bye.

1010
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,062
Bye... bye!

1011
01:04:35,217 --> 01:04:36,049
Who is it?

1012
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,108
Michele! I forgot the keys.

1013
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:41,078
Mario, don't be stupid.
My brother is due any minute now.

1014
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,811
Give me a kiss and leave...

1015
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,534
Open up! You shameless woman!

1016
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:51,089
Open up!

1017
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:53,687
To you and to you!
Don't be afraid!

1018
01:04:53,953 --> 01:04:55,516
Let me look at you,
so brazen faced!

1019
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,029
-Dear Lady, I wanna marry him.
-You've been speaking to Mario?

1020
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:01,212
Who's gonna marry you now?
Here, look here.

1021
01:05:01,383 --> 01:05:03,786
There's only one heart in my breast
and I wanna give it to Mario!

1022
01:05:03,937 --> 01:05:05,725
I swear he's dead. This knife here,

1023
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:08,994
is made to make
you cry tears of blood!

1024
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,159
Michele!

1025
01:05:11,204 --> 01:05:12,488
Michele, no!

1026
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:15,919
If this vengeance goes my way,
you won't see him anymore!

1027
01:05:17,487 --> 01:05:19,657
-A crow bar in two sections.
-Yes, right...

1028
01:05:21,899 --> 01:05:24,065
-Blunt.
-Yes, blunt.

1029
01:05:26,114 --> 01:05:28,981
A dancer... that is a circular saw...

1030
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:30,820
-D'you know how to use it?
-Sure!

1031
01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:34,622
With an attached oiling gadget...

1032
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:36,364
Here we have a lubricating spout.

1033
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:38,499
And here, a drill.

1034
01:05:40,489 --> 01:05:41,621
A drill.

1035
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,121
-Blunt spout?
-Of course, blunt.

1036
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:45,700
Here are a few spare tips.

1037
01:05:47,898 --> 01:05:49,018
Chisel.

1038
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:51,086
-Blunt?
-Right, blunt.

1039
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,076
It's blunt all right. It has no tip.

1040
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,857
Well, what do you pretend?

1041
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,951
I've rented the other one
this morning

1042
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,059
to that famous gang from Milan,

1043
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,221
the one behind the famous
swiss jeweler job,

1044
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,524
it's been a busy week...
right, very busy...

1045
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,765
-I've rented 3 complete kits
in 5 days! -Really!

1046
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:13,628
Thank God,
business has taken off again.

1047
01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:15,243
It's very busy.

1048
01:06:15,562 --> 01:06:17,187
So, let's go on:

1049
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:22,376
three files, ten keys, one spear,

1050
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,815
a cheese grater,
where's the plunger? Here it is.

1051
01:06:27,747 --> 01:06:33,144
One frying pan, and lastly,
the crank.

1052
01:06:35,837 --> 01:06:39,632
Right, let's sum up, briefly.

1053
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:45,568
Listen here. To make a hole
in that wall... right?

1054
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,558
How do you go about it
using the crank?

1055
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:55,177
Right... we... we take all the furniture
in the flat...

1056
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,851
and we make a sort of a column...
between the two walls... and...

1057
01:07:00,653 --> 01:07:02,986
and in the middle we...
we stick the crank.

1058
01:07:03,506 --> 01:07:05,327
Good, very good!

1059
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:06,833
Here, gimme here...

1060
01:07:07,434 --> 01:07:10,513
And now, a little signature
on the bottom here.

1061
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,452
-What signature?
-What, what signature?

1062
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:14,884
And the guarantee?

1063
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,277
This is capital! I need a receipt.

1064
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:21,930
If I were greedy, I would have
asked for a deposit. Instead...

1065
01:07:22,861 --> 01:07:23,982
Will you sign?

1066
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:26,842
I say, will you sign?

1067
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:29,231
Good night! Are you slow?

1068
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:30,572
Gimme here, go on, I'll sign it.

1069
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:32,577
Let's just hurry up, it's already 7::30.

1070
01:07:44,505 --> 01:07:45,690
You've got penmanship, eh?

1071
01:07:45,841 --> 01:07:47,229
Be good, be good, let me sign it.

1072
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,242
Right. The wrapping,
that's to say the suitcase.

1073
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:51,464
I'll leave it, right, guys!

1074
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:53,647
-Here you go. Did you do it?
-Here you go!

1075
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,342
Oh, were you in China?

1076
01:07:58,802 --> 01:07:59,909
And, and this suitcase here?

1077
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,698
This is my very own: I'm leaving.

1078
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:03,203
How come you're leaving?

1079
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:07,964
My friend, when there's a robbery,
I never hang around!

1080
01:08:09,137 --> 01:08:10,696
I go to Spoleto, to my dear aunt.

1081
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:14,441
Of course with my parole
officer's consent,

1082
01:08:15,028 --> 01:08:17,873
one can never be too careful!
Remember guys,

1083
01:08:18,203 --> 01:08:22,129
one can never be too careful!
Break a leg!

1084
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:30,103
He's right. We've gotta keep an
eye out and work scientifically!

1085
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:34,424
Well, you're exaggerating now.
What are we going to do?

1086
01:08:34,575 --> 01:08:36,134
We'll break the safe with the...

1087
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:37,347
Death stared me in the face!

1088
01:08:37,543 --> 01:08:38,421
What happened to you?

1089
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,785
I met the guy we stole
the camera from...

1090
01:08:40,936 --> 01:08:41,813
What did he do?

1091
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:43,264
Don't touch. He tore my arm off.

1092
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:45,065
-He broke your arm?
-Forty days!

1093
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,409
What should I have done?
I didn't even feel the pain.

1094
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,440
It was more the fright.

1095
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,602
The guy from Porta Portese?

1096
01:08:49,753 --> 01:08:51,169
Yes! He took me the whole way home

1097
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,810
and I had to give him
the camera back.

1098
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:54,455
That'll teach you to show up
in time.

1099
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,409
Earlier, you wouldn't have met him!

1100
01:08:56,568 --> 01:08:57,507
Right... I was early!

1101
01:08:57,658 --> 01:08:58,989
That's exactly why I came in late.

1102
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,699
Fine, it doesn't matter. Listen up!

1103
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:03,095
Easy, it hurts!

1104
01:09:04,503 --> 01:09:06,869
I'm meeting the girl at 9 pm

1105
01:09:07,072 --> 01:09:09,144
On the ninth, didn't we say today?

1106
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:12,695
Capannelle! At 9 pm today.
Understood?

1107
01:09:12,828 --> 01:09:13,941
Understood.

1108
01:09:14,075 --> 01:09:17,173
You, you'll be ready behind the
newstand around eleven thirty.

1109
01:09:17,305 --> 01:09:21,526
The newspaper stand, right?
At twelve I'll open the lobby door.

1110
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:27,299
I say midnight because, follow me,
at twelve those who are home

1111
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,223
are sleeping and those at the
movies still have to come back.

1112
01:09:30,611 --> 01:09:32,138
Understood? Clear?

1113
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,762
-Not clear at all!
-Why?

1114
01:09:34,895 --> 01:09:38,340
First of all, what are you going
to do with this girl

1115
01:09:38,491 --> 01:09:39,702
once you're in the apartment?

1116
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:43,231
Well, I don't know.
I haven't thought about it yet...

1117
01:09:43,352 --> 01:09:44,864
A good whack on the head, right?

1118
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:47,180
Fine, fine, I'll take care of it.
Just take it easy.

1119
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,059
It's, it's 7::34 pm.
Set your watches. Let's go.

1120
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:54,426
-Get lost! Well?
-Doesn't anybody have a watch?

1121
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,349
A watch, who's got that?

1122
01:09:56,481 --> 01:09:58,847
I did, but I pawned it.

1123
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:01,142
Anyway, tonight
I'm gonna get it back.

1124
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:04,216
Oh, finally!

1125
01:10:05,347 --> 01:10:06,882
You've dishonored my home!

1126
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:07,976
Are you crazy?

1127
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,784
I'm gonna tear my sister
from your chest!

1128
01:10:09,935 --> 01:10:10,924
Put the knife down!

1129
01:10:11,075 --> 01:10:12,039
Have you gone insane?

1130
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,048
Who touched my sister...
Let me go, Capannelle!

1131
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:15,431
Don't move. Don't be a kid!

1132
01:10:15,582 --> 01:10:16,780
Be good! Have you lost it?

1133
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:18,052
You'll get thirty years.

1134
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,033
Do you wanna spoil it all,
right tonight?

1135
01:10:20,184 --> 01:10:21,744
-I demand satisfaction!
-Fine!

1136
01:10:21,902 --> 01:10:24,906
First of all, if he stays in tonight,
just forget about me.

1137
01:10:25,453 --> 01:10:29,191
Easy. Your sister,
I haven't touched her at all.

1138
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:32,276
I'm serious about her. I love her.

1139
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:36,680
I would have already told you
if you weren't so thick.

1140
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:42,505
Go ahead and stay,
because I am leaving.

1141
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:44,271
So? What are you going to do?

1142
01:10:45,347 --> 01:10:48,029
I've given it a lot of thought
and I don't have the guts for it.

1143
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:50,199
Are you crazy?

1144
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:53,075
Maybe.

1145
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,025
But you are wise guys,
aren't you?

1146
01:10:56,743 --> 01:10:57,953
Cosimo was a wise guy too.

1147
01:10:58,902 --> 01:11:01,682
We've got it in our heads
to pull the job of our life,

1148
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,173
but it doesn't work this way
for the like of us.

1149
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:05,993
At least for the likes of me.

1150
01:11:06,865 --> 01:11:08,057
And there's my mother too.

1151
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,246
What will she do if something
happens to me?

1152
01:11:11,385 --> 01:11:13,182
Anyway, I've already gotten
myself a little job.

1153
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,280
At the Follie's theatre.

1154
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:17,275
If you want satisfaction,
I'll be there.

1155
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:27,928
Boys!

1156
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:31,912
I've had it! I really had it!

1157
01:11:33,246 --> 01:11:35,798
One's got a sister, the other
his mother, another one the kid.

1158
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:40,352
What's up? We've gotta make up
our minds now.

1159
01:11:41,713 --> 01:11:43,384
Are we going through with this job
or not?

1160
01:11:43,535 --> 01:11:45,094
-Are you in or are you out?
-Yes...

1161
01:11:47,342 --> 01:11:48,658
-Who's that?
-Shush! Quiet!

1162
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,423
-Who's there?
-It's me!

1163
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:54,529
That's Nicoletta.
Move, move, get out!

1164
01:11:54,968 --> 01:11:55,950
Out of that window.

1165
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:58,071
-Quick!
-Move... damn you.

1166
01:12:03,012 --> 01:12:03,905
Ah!

1167
01:12:04,797 --> 01:12:05,690
So... what's up?

1168
01:12:12,905 --> 01:12:15,389
My poor shoulder! Damn it! I've
been walking around for two hours!

1169
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,066
Come in, come in!

1170
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:19,716
How, how did you find me?

1171
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:22,128
I heard you giving the address
to the ballroom guy,

1172
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:23,775
for that stuff you'd broken, right?

1173
01:12:24,071 --> 01:12:27,549
What a...! That's why they came
here looking for money, see!

1174
01:12:28,148 --> 01:12:30,897
He's... he's my brother-in-law.
This is his place...

1175
01:12:31,829 --> 01:12:32,914
I'm his brother-in-law.

1176
01:12:33,355 --> 01:12:35,546
Right now, poor man,
he's... he's unemployed and...

1177
01:12:36,358 --> 01:12:40,317
So now and then I come here to...
to help him out... right?

1178
01:12:41,334 --> 01:12:42,789
I'm collecting unemployment.

1179
01:12:43,102 --> 01:12:44,030
Sit down, sit down.

1180
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:47,082
Ah, ah, ah! It's always so messy!

1181
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:49,487
Be careful, good God!

1182
01:12:52,957 --> 01:12:54,101
Well, let's see...

1183
01:12:56,049 --> 01:12:58,022
You needn't feel ashamed
about me anymore!

1184
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:59,592
Pardon?

1185
01:13:00,128 --> 01:13:01,334
I've quit!

1186
01:13:05,838 --> 01:13:07,844
How... what do you mean...
you've quit?

1187
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:11,075
Those two old hags...
I was their slave.

1188
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,689
First moving, and then this furniture
goes here, and there...

1189
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,478
I was never right about
a single thing.

1190
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:20,081
Dust this, polish that,
go shopping, and the cats' litter!

1191
01:13:20,779 --> 01:13:24,551
So I let it all out,
we're made of flesh too.

1192
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,637
When they were about ready to
leave for Genzano, I told them:

1193
01:13:27,848 --> 01:13:31,042
my dears, I'm sorry but this time
you are staying home. I'm leaving!

1194
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:34,372
Well. What does she mean?

1195
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,114
That dumb head didn't let them go?

1196
01:13:36,725 --> 01:13:39,019
I had to let you know because
that date we had in that house

1197
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:41,166
is no longer possible, you know...

1198
01:13:42,608 --> 01:13:43,437
Right...

1199
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:46,818
Now I better leave because the
nuns where I'll be staying tonight,

1200
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:49,079
close the doors at nine.
Could you walk me, right?

1201
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:51,046
What? Walk you?

1202
01:13:51,197 --> 01:13:54,937
No, I have to... I have to...
stay here with him, poor soul!

1203
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:59,249
Well, never mind. I'll go on my own.
I won't forget today too easily...

1204
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,662
Oh, my God, the keys!

1205
01:14:03,265 --> 01:14:04,790
I had them! Damn it!

1206
01:14:05,597 --> 01:14:06,863
I'll throw them in the river.

1207
01:14:07,249 --> 01:14:08,573
When they'll come back
the two hags

1208
01:14:08,724 --> 01:14:10,170
will have to knock down the door!

1209
01:14:10,757 --> 01:14:11,992
Sorry, what did you just say?

1210
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:16,400
Didn't you say that the two
old hags stayed home?

1211
01:14:16,921 --> 01:14:19,767
Right! As if they'd listen when
I speak! They're so selfish.

1212
01:14:20,558 --> 01:14:23,524
To spite me, they left cats
and everything and went.

1213
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:27,651
-So the house, it's empty?
-Yes...

1214
01:14:29,121 --> 01:14:30,494
...and you... you have the keys.

1215
01:14:30,684 --> 01:14:31,523
So what?

1216
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:33,169
-Fine, goodbye...
-Bye.

1217
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,250
-See you.
-See you?

1218
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:36,308
Aren't you walking her there?
She's got the keys...

1219
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:37,285
Which keys?

1220
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:39,148
How, which keys? You walk her...

1221
01:14:39,282 --> 01:14:41,615
Ah! She has... ah!
Ah! Right, that's right!

1222
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:43,307
I'm coming, I'm coming too!

1223
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:44,599
The keys.

1224
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,830
There's someone who
watches over us!

1225
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:51,662
-You know what?
-What?

1226
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:53,887
I'm really starting to like you.

1227
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,058
Same here.

1228
01:14:57,948 --> 01:15:00,365
But with good intentions
or do you only like me?

1229
01:15:01,972 --> 01:15:06,345
I... I... like you

1230
01:15:06,892 --> 01:15:08,645
and with good intentions too.

1231
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:22,924
You take my breath away...

1232
01:15:25,006 --> 01:15:26,034
We're nearly there.

1233
01:15:26,864 --> 01:15:28,043
Will I see you tomorrow?

1234
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:31,053
Eh! Sure I'll see you, of course.
I want to.

1235
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:33,825
Ah! No. I can't tomorrow... I can't.

1236
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:39,174
I have to go to Milan... it's for
business you know. I'm sorry.

1237
01:15:39,337 --> 01:15:40,310
Will you stay long?

1238
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:44,004
No, I'll be back soon and when
I'll be back... I'll see you...

1239
01:15:44,135 --> 01:15:46,470
I'll see you right away! Of course!

1240
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,932
-Could you do me a favor?
-Sure.

1241
01:15:49,286 --> 01:15:50,911
Could you drop the keys
with the doorman?

1242
01:15:52,508 --> 01:15:55,736
But didn't you say you were going
to throw them in the river?

1243
01:15:56,037 --> 01:15:57,755
Yes...
Sometimes one just says things.

1244
01:15:58,486 --> 01:16:00,945
Should anything happen,
it would be my fault.

1245
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:02,880
And... and what could happen?

1246
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:04,481
Say... a fire.

1247
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:06,704
It would be my fault
if I didn't leave the keys

1248
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:09,458
with the doorman and he couldn't
get in. Say they'll steal something...

1249
01:16:09,609 --> 01:16:11,753
Oh, God, where did I put them?
Virgin Mary!

1250
01:16:11,904 --> 01:16:13,017
Who would want to steal?

1251
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,566
Oh, God, where are they?

1252
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:19,014
Four years at their service
and I never mislaid a single thing.

1253
01:16:20,673 --> 01:16:21,786
Oh God! I lost them,

1254
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:24,277
what am I going to do now?
They won't believe me?

1255
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:26,655
Easy, take it easy. Let's see...

1256
01:16:27,469 --> 01:16:32,038
in the bottom of the bag...
here they are, here, see?

1257
01:16:32,373 --> 01:16:35,899
Damn it, you women! Head
in the clouds. Here they are.

1258
01:16:37,911 --> 01:16:39,645
Will you go right away?
Could you do it for me?

1259
01:16:39,796 --> 01:16:40,875
Sure, sure...

1260
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:45,107
-This is me. Ciao, eh!
-Bye.

1261
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:46,693
-Come back soon.
-Fine.

1262
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:56,505
Please don't forget the keys
or I'll get in trouble!

1263
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:59,869
I'm telling you not to worry. Bye...

1264
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,006
Bye...

1265
01:17:08,905 --> 01:17:11,272
Fifty, sixty... eighty...

1266
01:17:15,036 --> 01:17:17,104
eight and five...
... one hundred and fifteen.

1267
01:17:17,909 --> 01:17:18,748
Mario!

1268
01:17:22,503 --> 01:17:23,905
What do you want?

1269
01:17:27,452 --> 01:17:30,905
Where I am from we say: only God
knows if it'll turn out right or rotten.

1270
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:32,260
So what?

1271
01:17:32,879 --> 01:17:34,124
Well if the rotten part happens,

1272
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:36,299
I would beg you
to look after my sister.

1273
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,880
Respectfully, that is.

1274
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:42,838
Well, if that's the case I hope
they will catch you.

1275
01:17:47,715 --> 01:17:49,956
Fine, sure, don't worry.

1276
01:17:57,865 --> 01:17:59,338
Carmelina is locked inside,

1277
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,329
I have installed one more lock.

1278
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,249
-Why?
-Because of you.

1279
01:18:05,927 --> 01:18:06,942
And I was wrong.

1280
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,639
You're a good young man
who loves his mother.

1281
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:15,403
And you're right,
'cause we only have one!

1282
01:18:17,845 --> 01:18:19,301
Of course...

1283
01:18:28,024 --> 01:18:29,428
Popcorn, candy!

1284
01:18:44,665 --> 01:18:46,089
-Well?
-No keys.

1285
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:47,952
-Didn't you manage to get them?
-No.

1286
01:18:48,085 --> 01:18:50,474
Damn him, he's joking...
C'mon, take them out!

1287
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:54,390
I'm not joking.
She ran away suddenly...

1288
01:18:55,003 --> 01:18:57,491
She jumped on the tram
and that was that.

1289
01:18:57,642 --> 01:18:59,267
-No keys.
-Damn.

1290
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:02,021
-lf... if... if...
-Listen here, you gotta tell me

1291
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,624
who told you to go about
things scientifically!

1292
01:19:04,853 --> 01:19:06,609
-Give me here...
-What do you want? And you?

1293
01:19:06,906 --> 01:19:08,678
Who told you we need the keys?

1294
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,958
Right, because you, you
won't go ahead without the keys?

1295
01:19:12,701 --> 01:19:14,483
I'm sure you want
the safe's keys too.

1296
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:15,494
Sure.

1297
01:19:15,645 --> 01:19:18,396
How had we worked it out, before
that wretched girl showed up?

1298
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,721
Coal bin... courtyard... window!

1299
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:22,801
Window, right...

1300
01:19:22,952 --> 01:19:25,371
Fine, let's move it... Pliers!

1301
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:27,657
-You Capanne'...
-What?

1302
01:19:28,545 --> 01:19:31,776
You'll be on the look out.
Let's go. Quick!

1303
01:20:04,302 --> 01:20:05,314
Ferribotte,

1304
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:13,093
gimme the suitcase.

1305
01:20:13,905 --> 01:20:16,589
Slide down, you're good,
there's a pile of coal.

1306
01:20:17,042 --> 01:20:18,668
Go, go easy.

1307
01:20:21,131 --> 01:20:22,243
Did you land on the coal?

1308
01:20:23,092 --> 01:20:25,264
What coal? It's sewage!

1309
01:20:28,963 --> 01:20:30,076
It stinks! C'mon.

1310
01:20:31,862 --> 01:20:33,107
Easy, my arm!

1311
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:35,072
You can't think about your arm
right now!

1312
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:01,660
I keep taking my hat on and off.

1313
01:21:15,072 --> 01:21:16,269
Ferribotte,

1314
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,928
gimme a hand!

1315
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:20,356
I was drying myself off!

1316
01:21:34,077 --> 01:21:35,987
Bag, tools,

1317
01:21:41,678 --> 01:21:42,758
you idiot.

1318
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:44,072
I thought it was locked.

1319
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:47,907
Let's keep moving.

1320
01:21:49,407 --> 01:21:50,477
Quickly!

1321
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:02,700
Lock it now. First one, go in!

1322
01:22:21,884 --> 01:22:23,346
-What's up!
-I banged my arm.

1323
01:22:23,484 --> 01:22:24,695
-Quiet.
-It hurts, no!

1324
01:22:24,828 --> 01:22:25,844
I told you to keep quiet!

1325
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:29,053
C'mon... what a guy!

1326
01:22:39,019 --> 01:22:40,181
Go on, move!

1327
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:43,888
Take it easy!

1328
01:22:44,185 --> 01:22:45,646
It wasn't me, you know!

1329
01:22:57,024 --> 01:22:58,618
C'mon, move it.

1330
01:23:06,635 --> 01:23:07,716
These were brand new!

1331
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,277
-C'mon, c'mon!
-Easy, easy.

1332
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:29,164
Wait, first one,

1333
01:23:30,098 --> 01:23:31,359
go on, c'mon.

1334
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:47,449
You're so heavy! Damn it!

1335
01:23:55,484 --> 01:23:56,399
Hurry up!

1336
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,909
-Don't talk!
-Ah, help me!

1337
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:06,507
-Silence, quiet! I told you to keep quiet!
-Easy!

1338
01:24:07,249 --> 01:24:08,100
Silence!

1339
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,837
-Don't pull me this way!
-Keep quiet!

1340
01:24:20,516 --> 01:24:21,377
First one go on...

1341
01:24:21,507 --> 01:24:22,727
Who's this 'Firstone' anyway?

1342
01:24:24,068 --> 01:24:27,385
Whomever, let's go, follow him.

1343
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,129
-I don't want to stay here.
-Why not?

1344
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,308
Because I don't want to.

1345
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:50,808
You haven't been honest with me!

1346
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:52,279
Me? You haven't been honest
with me!

1347
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:54,933
This isn't true. I was always
honest with you. Ask Adelaide.

1348
01:24:55,084 --> 01:24:56,237
She is a good one to ask!

1349
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:58,419
Why should I believe you but
you won't believe her?

1350
01:24:58,575 --> 01:25:00,673
What are you saying!? You
can't compare me with Adelaide.

1351
01:25:00,824 --> 01:25:02,106
What's wrong with Adelaide?

1352
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:03,516
I don't like her, that's it.

1353
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:04,806
And I don't like staying here.

1354
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:06,641
-What's wrong with it?
- I don't want to stay!

1355
01:25:06,792 --> 01:25:09,120
-Tell me why?
-'Cause you haven't been honest.

1356
01:25:09,325 --> 01:25:10,477
Because you've lied to me!

1357
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:12,169
You're ducking so that
you won't get hit!

1358
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,405
Imagine, I duck!
That's you and you know why!

1359
01:25:14,536 --> 01:25:16,161
No, I really don't know
what you mean...

1360
01:25:16,297 --> 01:25:17,408
You know it very well!

1361
01:25:17,543 --> 01:25:19,583
C'mon, let's hear it!
What do you know very well?

1362
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:22,220
-I don't feel like telling you!
-I won't stay here a minute longer.

1363
01:25:22,371 --> 01:25:24,557
-Why? -Because I don't want to.
-You said you would before!

1364
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,853
And now you're touching me?

1365
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:27,394
What did we come here for, then?

1366
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:29,694
Because I was mistaken...
I thought you were honest!

1367
01:25:29,827 --> 01:25:31,550
Tell me, when haven't I been
honest with you?

1368
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:32,586
You know it! You know it!

1369
01:25:32,737 --> 01:25:34,199
You listen to that Adelaide.
That's your problem.

1370
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:35,481
I don't want to stay here,
d'you hear me?

1371
01:25:35,638 --> 01:25:36,848
Am I or am I not right
when I'm saying

1372
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:37,941
you listen too much to Adelaide?

1373
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:39,835
That isn't true! I've always
been honest with you.

1374
01:25:39,986 --> 01:25:41,077
The same here.
You must believe me!

1375
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:41,991
That's not true!
I'm telling you!

1376
01:25:42,165 --> 01:25:43,477
Listen, I don't want to stay here!

1377
01:25:43,724 --> 01:25:44,751
Tell me, tell me why?

1378
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:45,847
You don't like it?

1379
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:47,224
Yes, I do like it, but you're a liar.

1380
01:25:47,357 --> 01:25:48,916
Me? You lied to me first.

1381
01:25:49,051 --> 01:25:51,061
That's not true!
I've always been honest with you!

1382
01:25:51,257 --> 01:25:52,438
Right, I don't want to stay here!

1383
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:53,469
Ah, won't you tell me why?

1384
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:55,686
I don't know how else to tell you.
You haven't been honest with me!

1385
01:25:55,789 --> 01:25:57,762
When you don't know what to say,
you tell me I am lying!

1386
01:25:57,913 --> 01:26:00,259
Because you are! Listen, I don't
want to stay here anymore!

1387
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:02,843
But first you said yes!
See it's you, not me.

1388
01:26:12,786 --> 01:26:15,338
Ah! We're on the horse's back...
carry on.

1389
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:21,803
It's slippery.
I won't make it, you know.

1390
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:25,925
Don't worry, trust me.

1391
01:26:28,395 --> 01:26:30,248
-We're going down here, it seems.
-Quiet!

1392
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,044
-What happened?
-Keep quiet,

1393
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:38,185
all of you quiet!

1394
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:49,814
Here's the window.

1395
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,248
Here we are boys.

1396
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:07,067
-All ready to go?
-Yes... yes...

1397
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:11,102
Careful...

1398
01:27:23,704 --> 01:27:26,518
-The plun... the plun...
-The plunger, I know.

1399
01:27:36,775 --> 01:27:39,524
Here, here...
take it away, take it away.

1400
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:42,356
-Slowly, you're cutting my hand.
-Don't cut me, hear me?

1401
01:28:06,184 --> 01:28:07,045
Get down!

1402
01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:11,614
I'm exhausted. When I think that
girl nearly dropped us the keys...

1403
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,397
Hold it, hold it!

1404
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,775
Here. Here's the dining room.

1405
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:32,242
-No, I'm wrong.
-This is the dining room.

1406
01:28:32,965 --> 01:28:33,826
Strange,

1407
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:37,239
turn it on.

1408
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,430
Don't turn it on,
first shut the window.

1409
01:28:41,211 --> 01:28:43,544
This is the wall.
Let's move the furniture.

1410
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:48,319
Help me.

1411
01:28:58,618 --> 01:29:00,701
Hey tap it quietly, or
you'll wake the whole building.

1412
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:02,383
I have to try it one way
or the other!

1413
01:29:05,364 --> 01:29:06,856
-I'd try this way!
-Yes!

1414
01:29:06,993 --> 01:29:09,381
Let's do it scientifically.

1415
01:29:13,908 --> 01:29:15,434
-Go on!
-Easy...

1416
01:29:19,235 --> 01:29:22,267
Oh, it's as soft as cheese.
Oh, God!

1417
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:27,672
What are you doing?
Spot on the water pipe!

1418
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:35,979
The light, turn off the light!

1419
01:29:49,709 --> 01:29:50,755
Shush!

1420
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:57,203
Hello? Hello?

1421
01:29:57,865 --> 01:29:59,114
Mrs. Ciarrocchi?

1422
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:01,458
I'm Fernando the night porter...

1423
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:04,884
No, nothing.
Everything's fine here...

1424
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,858
Yes, yes, the girl's left.

1425
01:30:10,054 --> 01:30:11,268
No, she didn't take anything...

1426
01:30:11,403 --> 01:30:12,716
Yes, don't worry.

1427
01:30:13,786 --> 01:30:16,145
I've called you because
you said to call you

1428
01:30:16,284 --> 01:30:20,006
as soon as they return the keys,
no matter what time...

1429
01:30:20,839 --> 01:30:22,984
So I called. Was I wrong?

1430
01:30:23,907 --> 01:30:27,643
No! Yes, I have the keys,
don't worry ma'am...

1431
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:32,050
The cats?
The cats are a little filthy.

1432
01:30:33,587 --> 01:30:35,898
Well, a little filthy, there.

1433
01:30:36,221 --> 01:30:39,599
Yes, it's dropped one right now
and run away.

1434
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,192
I'm telling you,
in the dining room.

1435
01:30:42,621 --> 01:30:44,342
Yes... just wait a second...

1436
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:46,760
I'll grab it and I'll let it out... Right?

1437
01:30:53,277 --> 01:30:55,277
Damn it! You filthy fiend!

1438
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,712
Hello? Hello, ma'am?

1439
01:30:59,896 --> 01:31:01,308
Yes, yes, I got it...

1440
01:31:01,611 --> 01:31:03,848
The keys? No, they didn't bring
them back right now,

1441
01:31:04,038 --> 01:31:06,878
they brought them back while l
was waiting for my sister-in-law...

1442
01:31:07,817 --> 01:31:09,336
No, I didn't get them from Nicoletta.

1443
01:31:09,487 --> 01:31:12,532
I got them from a guy who said
he was her fiance!

1444
01:31:13,238 --> 01:31:16,445
Well... He was a tall guy,
this tall, what do I know!?

1445
01:31:17,349 --> 01:31:20,984
Don't worry ma'am, right.
See you soon. Take care!

1446
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:28,257
You wretch, miserable wretch!

1447
01:31:28,518 --> 01:31:30,434
What? If we'd come in
with the keys,

1448
01:31:30,598 --> 01:31:31,745
it wouldn't have been burglary

1449
01:31:31,896 --> 01:31:34,678
and we'd have been off the hook
for aggravating circumstance.

1450
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,298
You're so stupid!
You're such cretins!

1451
01:31:38,522 --> 01:31:39,934
Don't you know why I did it?

1452
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:45,529
-It's my alibi.
-Alibi?

1453
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:50,278
Sure! That guy, the night porter,
saw me and I gave him the keys.

1454
01:31:50,514 --> 01:31:52,628
And I'm fine, right?

1455
01:31:52,918 --> 01:31:55,014
It couldn't have been me...
And you're my friends!

1456
01:31:55,257 --> 01:31:57,044
Actually...
I thought it was serious thinking...

1457
01:31:57,195 --> 01:31:59,724
Ah, you had your serious thinking,
but you're telling us just now?

1458
01:32:00,004 --> 01:32:01,649
And we are so stupid as
to believe you!

1459
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,333
We're in the hands of a madman,
we're...

1460
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:04,918
-Captain Hook!
-Quiet!

1461
01:32:05,069 --> 01:32:08,015
I see! You've fallen for the maid!

1462
01:32:08,181 --> 01:32:11,094
Me? Me? Don't listen to him, eh!

1463
01:32:11,702 --> 01:32:13,922
Tomorrow, as soon as
we get the money,

1464
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:16,061
we'll split and I'll never
see her again!

1465
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:18,886
Imagine, me...

1466
01:32:21,605 --> 01:32:22,581
Well, and even if it were?

1467
01:32:22,732 --> 01:32:24,425
There was no need for her
to get involved.

1468
01:32:24,576 --> 01:32:27,100
What did I tell you?
He risks our skin, for a...

1469
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:29,363
Quiet, I have an iron fist you know!

1470
01:32:29,539 --> 01:32:32,101
-An iron brain too!
-Hold it! Be serious!

1471
01:32:32,392 --> 01:32:34,976
What's this? You wanna
compromise everything

1472
01:32:35,309 --> 01:32:37,171
for a stupid issue? Look!
Follow your elders!

1473
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,875
Help me.

1474
01:32:39,683 --> 01:32:41,665
C'mon you two!

1475
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:43,356
The door's heavy you know!

1476
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:45,425
C'mon, let's rest it there!

1477
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:48,994
Did you pile up the books?

1478
01:32:49,247 --> 01:32:50,526
Here, this is the last one.

1479
01:32:51,121 --> 01:32:54,985
Fine. Don't let go.
The pan, who's got the pan?

1480
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:58,125
I do. It's not like we're breaking
the safe too, right?

1481
01:32:58,327 --> 01:33:00,307
I wish! Move more to your left,
on the corner.

1482
01:33:00,645 --> 01:33:03,412
Ah, sweet safe!
I wonder what you're holding!

1483
01:33:03,563 --> 01:33:04,996
-Who can say?
-Quiet...

1484
01:33:06,919 --> 01:33:07,867
Here we are!

1485
01:33:11,765 --> 01:33:12,770
I'm going.

1486
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,367
There it goes...
Hear the click?

1487
01:33:17,255 --> 01:33:18,951
-Is the wall holding?
-Yes, yes, yes...

1488
01:33:19,172 --> 01:33:20,746
Good, good, it's giving way, there...

1489
01:33:22,289 --> 01:33:25,126
I'm not one of those guys that
gets some dough, squanders it

1490
01:33:25,277 --> 01:33:29,280
and ends up losing his shirt.

1491
01:33:31,759 --> 01:33:33,316
I'll get a little house
with four rooms

1492
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:37,597
and a bank account for the kid,
so he can remember

1493
01:33:37,748 --> 01:33:39,576
all the sacrifices
his father's made for him...

1494
01:33:42,141 --> 01:33:45,379
And you know what I'll do?
I'll get a beautiful mistress, see!

1495
01:33:45,947 --> 01:33:50,338
I'll give her a monthly allowance
of 25,000 lira, perhaps 30.

1496
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:53,411
But she pays for her food...

1497
01:34:00,153 --> 01:34:02,045
Here we go, it's giving in!

1498
01:34:06,061 --> 01:34:09,405
C'mon Capannelle!
Instead of talking mistresses,

1499
01:34:10,455 --> 01:34:12,579
go get me a glass of water,
I'm thirsty.

1500
01:34:15,248 --> 01:34:17,588
C'mon, Pe'! C'mon.

1501
01:34:37,989 --> 01:34:39,410
What are you doing there?

1502
01:34:39,932 --> 01:34:41,343
What are you doing there?

1503
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:42,926
Mother!

1504
01:34:44,644 --> 01:34:46,021
What has happened?

1505
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:53,249
Move!

1506
01:34:55,405 --> 01:34:56,816
That's the wrong wall.

1507
01:35:02,152 --> 01:35:03,267
Damn it!

1508
01:35:04,684 --> 01:35:06,378
We really blew it!

1509
01:35:07,059 --> 01:35:09,652
Nicoletta told me they'd moved
the furniture.

1510
01:35:09,939 --> 01:35:11,765
This was the dining room.

1511
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:15,603
This is what happened
to the Rosetta's cook.

1512
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:18,999
What cook?

1513
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:21,234
We know which one is the
real wall, right?

1514
01:35:21,558 --> 01:35:23,472
We'll break it
and we'll end up right there.

1515
01:35:23,681 --> 01:35:24,829
-Right in jail.
-Why?

1516
01:35:24,999 --> 01:35:26,212
What are you thinking about?

1517
01:35:26,363 --> 01:35:28,327
We need an hour and a quarter
to make another hole,

1518
01:35:28,627 --> 01:35:30,623
when we're on the other
side at least two hours

1519
01:35:30,774 --> 01:35:34,023
with the circular saw,
look at the time... look at the time!

1520
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:40,545
Well forget about it.
See all this labor,

1521
01:35:41,025 --> 01:35:43,235
all this danger for nothing, fine.
Understood?

1522
01:35:45,352 --> 01:35:46,216
Just see!

1523
01:35:47,897 --> 01:35:48,980
Good work, eh?

1524
01:35:49,425 --> 01:35:52,825
Good work yes, you see,
a skilled job, right?

1525
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:57,218
Scientific, that's what I'm saying,
are we capitulating now?

1526
01:35:57,782 --> 01:36:01,502
Understood? And if we sped up?
The doors are already off,

1527
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,903
I say we can make it, right?

1528
01:36:05,644 --> 01:36:06,840
What do you want?

1529
01:36:07,526 --> 01:36:09,776
-This is good.
-Leave me alone, understood?

1530
01:36:10,261 --> 01:36:12,153
Impossible. We'll never make it,

1531
01:36:13,398 --> 01:36:15,923
stealing is a serious profession
you need serious people,

1532
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:18,665
not people like you.
All you can do at your best is work.

1533
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:21,032
Working... I know,

1534
01:36:22,496 --> 01:36:23,612
but working is tiring.

1535
01:36:25,013 --> 01:36:26,321
This is really good.

1536
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:27,555
I don't want it, what is it?

1537
01:36:27,706 --> 01:36:28,545
Pasta and beans.

1538
01:36:28,696 --> 01:36:30,290
Well, I say,
I got you all the way here.

1539
01:36:30,502 --> 01:36:32,300
If we had some mishap,
am I to blame?

1540
01:36:33,097 --> 01:36:35,525
Everything was clear,
all written down.

1541
01:36:35,708 --> 01:36:36,999
-Listen to me.
-This is so good...

1542
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,224
Stop thinking, the best thing
you can do for yourself.

1543
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:42,572
You're strong, hand and shovel,
that's your style.

1544
01:36:44,128 --> 01:36:46,140
How do you open it? Damn it...

1545
01:36:46,338 --> 01:36:49,893
See, see one of the burglars!
Pull it this way...

1546
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:55,404
There's ice too, look!

1547
01:36:55,835 --> 01:36:59,904
So, you say forget about it, we'll
lose all the expense money too.

1548
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,414
There are four meat wraps.

1549
01:37:02,565 --> 01:37:03,713
Who are you blaming?

1550
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,911
You know this is not bad! Good...

1551
01:37:08,106 --> 01:37:09,736
Sure, Nicoletta made it!

1552
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:14,054
If we wanted to be really picky, it
could do with an extra drop of oil.

1553
01:37:17,953 --> 01:37:19,451
Honestly. Here, taste it.

1554
01:37:19,721 --> 01:37:21,746
No... I don't think so.

1555
01:37:22,264 --> 01:37:23,434
I'll warm it up a little...

1556
01:37:23,585 --> 01:37:24,688
I like it this way.

1557
01:37:29,805 --> 01:37:31,538
Taste here, throw it down.

1558
01:37:32,047 --> 01:37:34,333
At home we say:
saucy woman makes a good mistress,

1559
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:36,794
bland woman a good wife.

1560
01:37:37,827 --> 01:37:38,809
Understand?

1561
01:37:47,913 --> 01:37:49,911
This is really good.
I was really hungry.

1562
01:37:51,937 --> 01:37:56,606
Boys. I'm afraid we've broken
the gas pipe. It doesn't light.

1563
01:37:57,032 --> 01:38:00,984
Oh, God help us! Saint Rosalie!

1564
01:38:17,499 --> 01:38:19,044
Hey, this is my tram.

1565
01:38:19,787 --> 01:38:21,808
See you, I'm going to prison
to pick up the kid.

1566
01:38:22,837 --> 01:38:23,809
See you...

1567
01:38:25,893 --> 01:38:27,641
Listen here, when will I see you?

1568
01:38:28,553 --> 01:38:29,487
Why?

1569
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,413
The less we see each other,
the better. Bye.

1570
01:38:35,428 --> 01:38:37,621
Actually, I've never known you!

1571
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:47,897
I'm a veteran.

1572
01:39:00,381 --> 01:39:01,540
Let's go, c'mon!

1573
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:13,895
You... what are you doing now?

1574
01:39:14,046 --> 01:39:15,493
I'll wait for the 31.

1575
01:39:15,644 --> 01:39:16,465
Ciao!

1576
01:39:30,188 --> 01:39:31,688
So, where are you going now?

1577
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:33,876
Well...

1578
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:37,449
Well, well, well, I understand!

1579
01:39:37,758 --> 01:39:39,876
That maid, she's cute you know.

1580
01:39:40,112 --> 01:39:46,111
Quit, quit calling her maid, she's not
going back to that, she's too frail.

1581
01:39:47,174 --> 01:39:48,929
Here they come! Act cool.

1582
01:39:58,608 --> 01:40:00,684
Damn Capannelle. Stop that alarm.

1583
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:04,701
Oh, mother, it's the alarm! I can't
shut it, it's not easy you know!

1584
01:40:07,447 --> 01:40:08,544
Let's turn around.

1585
01:40:20,513 --> 01:40:23,247
We've been out here two hours,
won't you open up? We're fed up!

1586
01:40:27,658 --> 01:40:29,187
Get back in line with the others,
c'mon.

1587
01:40:29,454 --> 01:40:34,078
Ah see! What are they distributing,
winter provisions?

1588
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:36,756
C'mon, you know very well
they're calling out for work.

1589
01:40:37,235 --> 01:40:38,945
Work... let's split Capannelle... Go...

1590
01:40:39,096 --> 01:40:41,780
Let me go... I'm not in here,

1591
01:40:42,711 --> 01:40:44,217
I'm just passing by!
Let's go...

1592
01:40:48,633 --> 01:40:51,543
Let go of me, let me go.
I'll leave on my own. Let go.

1593
01:40:55,408 --> 01:40:56,699
I say,

1594
01:40:59,908 --> 01:41:02,798
look where I've ended up;
with the workers.

1595
01:41:07,179 --> 01:41:10,305
Peppe, where are you going?
Where?

1596
01:41:10,456 --> 01:41:11,783
I have to...

1597
01:41:14,781 --> 01:41:18,214
Peppe, they'll make you work,
you know...

1598
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:29,957
Persons unknown...

1599
01:41:30,108 --> 01:41:31,512
bore a hole to steal
pasta and beans.

1600
01:41:31,663 --> 01:41:34,122
Police are investigating
a strange burglary from last night.

1601
01:41:34,273 --> 01:41:36,622
A group of thieves broke into
an apartment in Via delle Madonne,

1602
01:41:36,773 --> 01:41:38,333
through a window overlooking the...
