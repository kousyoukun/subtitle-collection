2
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,567
Hey, love bug.
You ready?

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,687
Oh, yeah.

4
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,330
Hey, guess what, Mom?
What?

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,164
I figured out where
wasps come from.

6
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,810
Oh, yeah? Where?

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,087
Well, I think
it must be,

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,404
if you flick water into the air
just right, it'll turn into a wasp.

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,323
Hey!
Yep.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,606
That's cool.

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,124
So, how was your day
at school?

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,964
Fine.

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,169
I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time.
I kind of liked her.

14
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,129
What'd she say?

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,851
Well, she said that you weren't
turning in your homework assignments.

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,126
And I told her,
"I know he does them,

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,804
"'cause I check them
every night."

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,405
She said she found
a big chunk of them

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,807
crumpled up at the bottom
of your backpack.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,450
She didn't ask for 'em.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,251
Baby, she doesn't have to. You're
just supposed to turn them in.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,085
And she said you're still
staring out the window all day.

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,210
Not all day.

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,884
And she said that you destroyed
her pencil sharpener.

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,890
Not on purpose!

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,167
Wait! She said that you crammed
a bunch of rocks in it.

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,165
I thought if we could
sharpen pencils,

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,004
maybe we could
sharpen rocks.

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,605
Well, what were you gonna do
with a bunch of sharpened rocks?

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,050
I was trying to make arrowheads
for my rock collection.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,201
Mm.

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,483
Dude, my turn!

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,607
Hold on.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,448
Mason!

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,520
Samantha!

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,201
Oh!

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,362
Tommy! ls Mason down there?

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,761
Yeah.

39
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,606
Well, tell him he has to
come home to dinner.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,170
Okay.

41
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,441
Hey-

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,648
Hey, sweetie.
Why aren't you ready?

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,001
Hey, Mason.

44
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,127
Hey,Ted.

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,206
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go.

46
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,168
What time is it? It's 9:00.
Let's go, let's go!

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,368
Okay, I meant to call you,
'cause Janice flaked out.

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,851
I don't have a sitter.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,251
Why didn't you
call somebody else?

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,766
I can't get a babysitter now.
It's 9:00.

51
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,729
But you're welcome to
hang out with us.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,450
Well, no!
I mean, we have plans.

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,363
The guys are expecting me.

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,967
Well, you can go.
All right.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,722
I'll come back in
a couple of hours.

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,410
Is that okay?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,368
Yeah. Yes, it's okay.
All right.

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,840
"'Turn back! Turn back! I don't
wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle.'

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,366
"'Who?' said Harry,
as they backtracked quickly.

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,851
"'She haunts
one of the toilets

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,083
"in the girls' bathroom on the
first floor,' said Hermione.

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,242
"'She haunts a toilet?'

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,890
'Yes, it's been
out of order all year,

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,043
"'because she keeps having
tantrums and flooding the place!'

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,043
"'l never went in there
anyway, if I could avoid it.'

66
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,045
"'It's awful trying to have a
pee with her wailing at you."'

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,646
Why can't you
just say that?

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,881
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,644
You're sorry, that's bullshit!

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,006
That's right. I wanna
stay here with my kids.

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,127
That's what I'd rather do.

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,282
Would you stop using
your kids as an excuse?

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,483
I know you have to stay here with your kids!
You're acting...

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,484
You have this immature life.
You have no responsibility!

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,561
I have
an immature life!

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
I have responsibility.
I have an immature life.

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,961
You don't know what
it's like to be a parent.

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,007
No, I don't!

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,084
And why am I responsible
for your mistakes in life?

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,401
Don't call my kids mistakes!
Don't!

81
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,641
I didn't call your kids...

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,484
You said, "Your mistakes in your
life," pointing at my kids.

83
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,927
I know what I said, you know. And
immediately you use your kids again.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,287
This is the reality.
I'm a parent!

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,089
- That means responsibility.
- I know you're a parent.

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,925
I would love to
have some time to myself!

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,843
I would love to just
go to a fuckin' movie!

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,081
You don't think
I'd like that?

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,288
Go have some dinner,
go to a bar!

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,725
I don't even know
what that's like!

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,804
I was someone's daughter, then I
was somebody's fuckin' mother!

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,609
Okay? I don't know
what that's like!

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,761
Stop!

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,441
Quit it!

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,961
Quit it!

96
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,450
Mom!

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,329
What the hell is
going on in here?

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,010
Do you guys
know what time it is?

99
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,811
He's throwing
things at me.

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,969
Mason! Do not throw
things at your sister!

101
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,883
She's faking,
she hit me first!

102
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,564
Listen, both of you!

103
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,641
I'm going back to bed.

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,927
I don't wanna hear another
peep out of here for an hour.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,001
Go to sleep.

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,531
- Faker!
- Guys!

107
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,649
Awesome!

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,321
Look what I found
in the street.

109
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,681
Dude!

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,691
I know, right?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,684
Look at those.

112
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,010
Ooh! Look at those!

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,161
Awesome!

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,566
So listen, guys, I wanna
talk to you about something.

115
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,244
And you might not like
this idea at first,

116
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,970
but we're moving
to Houston.

117
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,361
When?

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,607
Well, soon.

119
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,761
We should be out
by the first,

120
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,490
so we don't have to pay
two rents next month.

121
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,047
No, Mother, we're not moving.
Nope,nope.

122
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,726
Sorry, Mom. Nope.Nope.

123
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,368
Samantha, I have to
go back to college,

124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,561
so I can make us
a better living.

125
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,011
With this job, I can't take
care of us the way I'd like to.

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,441
I can't keep
going this way.

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,170
And Grandma said
she'd help us out,

128
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,089
and it would be nice
to be near her.

129
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,127
Fine, Mother.

130
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,526
You can do
whatever you want,

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,523
but we're not moving.

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,645
And what about
our friends?

133
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,044
Oh, baby, we can
email them or write.

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,724
We can come back to visit.

135
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,006
And guess what?

136
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,491
This place that
Grandma found us,

137
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,086
you'll each have
your own room. Right?

138
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,084
And there's a pool.

139
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,647
Mom, do you
still love Dad?

140
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,769
I still love your father,

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,565
but that doesn't mean it was
healthy for us to stay together.

142
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,088
What if after we move he's
trying to find us and he can't?

143
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,648
Oh, that won't be a problem.

144
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,966
He can call Grandma
and she'll tell him,

145
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,610
or he can call Information.

146
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,331
We won't be hard to find.

147
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,570
Is he still in Alaska?

148
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,206
Well, that's what your uncle says.

149
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,206
Probably taming
polar bears or something.

150
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,965
Yeah. Well, I hope they're taming him.

151
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,289
Here, wanna help me out?

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,486
Sure.

153
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,565
Okay. Take this paint
very carefully

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,883
and paint any little
smudge or mark or anything

155
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,325
on the baseboard there,

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,802
behind the door and all around
the doorways on the inside.

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,288
She says
we're gonna come visit

158
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,488
and I'm gonna write
and call you.

159
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,002
Oh, wait, hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.

160
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,085
Hello?

161
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,001
Sorry, Tommy.

162
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,560
Mason can't come over today.
We're moving.

163
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,005
And I'm on the other line.

164
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,127
Bye.

165
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,925
Althea?

166
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm gonna be sending
Sailor Scout instructions.

167
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,171
Email and write back telling me
how the other scouts are doing.

168
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,841
Well,because
you're the leader now.

169
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,843
Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna
get there before it gets dark.

170
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,481
Goodbye, yard. Goodbye, crape myrtle.
Goodbye, mailbox.

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,086
Goodbye, box of stuff Mommy
won't let us take with us,

172
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,764
but we don't wanna
throw away.

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,841
Goodbye, house.

174
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,009
I'll never like Mommy as
much for making us move!

175
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,366
Samantha!

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,250
Why don't you say goodbye to that
little horseshit attitude, okay?

177
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,288
'Cause we're not taking
that in the car.

178
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,490
Goodbye, old lady who listens
to rock music and rides a motorcycle.

179
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,041
OLIVIA; Hey!

180
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,210
What's happening back there?
Stop, put the barrier up.

181
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,331
Hey! Put the pillow
between you.

182
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,051
Make a barrier,
come on. Stop.

183
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,851
We're gonna play a game
called The Game of Silence.

184
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,084
Whoever can stay quiet for the
longest period of time wins.

185
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,322
You guys think
you can do that?

186
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,082
Okay, go.

187
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,882
The bus will be here
in 10 minutes.

188
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,321
Put that homework
in your backpack.

189
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,450
Go eat!

190
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,360
Baby, go eat.

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,726
I am!

192
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,842
Speak English!

193
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,888
Shut up! Mom!

194
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,849
She's speaking that
stupid language again!

195
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,882
Samantha!

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,731
I was speaking perfectly
clear English, Mother.

197
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,723
He's a little slow
in the head.

198
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,410
He did officially
flunk first grade.

199
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,606
Sit your butt down!

200
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,284
Yes, sir, Mother, sir!

201
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,891
All right, listen up, guys. Grandma's
gonna pick you up after school.

202
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,291
Your dad's in town
for the day.

203
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,771
So you're gonna spend
the afternoon with him.

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,082
Oh.
Is he moving back?

205
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,731
I don't know.

206
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,087
We haven't seen him
in about 80 years.

207
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,090
Like a year and a half.

208
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,605
Ha-ha!

209
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,647
Oh, please.

210
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,564
Can we please eat here?
The bus is coming.

211
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,687
Who wants syrup?

212
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,884
All right,
nice cursive.

213
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,130
Okay, Mason, when I check the
mobiles, am I gonna find yours?

214
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,201
No.

215
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,327
And why not?

216
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,164
'Cause I didn't
finish it.

217
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,969
Well, it's time
to finish it.

218
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,371
Just a minute.

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,886
No, let's do...
Apple Quit.

220
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,483
Time to finish your work, Mason.
"Apple Quit."

221
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,045
- So this is my history test.
Mmm-hmm.

222
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,721
"A+", very good.

223
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,325
And that's
another history test.

224
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,129
Mmm-hmm.
And another

225
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,243
Yeah, it doesn't have
a plus, but, oh, well.

226
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,965
And then, um, that's
my report on lizards.

227
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,405
Oh. Let me see
your pictures.

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,845
Oh, yeah.
These are my pictures.

229
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,081
What is that?

230
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,286
Well, that's called
a dewlap.

231
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,885
A dewlap, okay.

232
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,450
Oh, yeah,
this is a math test.

233
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,646
CATHERINE; Oh, "A" again.

234
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,405
Mase, that's the last
candy,okay?

235
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,084
Okay-

236
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,403
We need to put this stuff up.

237
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,603
That's him.

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,091
Daddy!

239
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,291
Oh, my God! Look at
you, you're so big!

240
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,850
<i>Hey, NU.</i>

241
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,206
What's happenin', buddy?

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,327
Huh? You guys ready
to have some fun?

243
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,367
Yeah!

244
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,169
Yeah! All right.

245
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,123
Hey, Catherine, how are you?
Mase, I'm good.

246
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,247
Mmm, good to see you.
Yeah.

247
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,288
What time should
I have these rascals back?

248
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,044
Oh, I don't know,
around 7:30, I guess.

249
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,246
I gotta get them
home by 8:00.

250
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,369
Oh, you know what, why don't I
take 'em over to their mom's?

251
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,090
No, that's okay.
She's expecting me.

252
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,288
No, that's all right. You guys
know where it is, don't you?

253
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,964
Oh, yeah. All right. I'll do it.
It's no problem.

254
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,121
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

255
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,565
Look, it's no problem.
All right?

256
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,529
You guys ready to go? Let's do it, go!

257
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,206
Go? Wait a minute.
You gotta get your stuff.

258
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,930
You got backpack,
your purse,

259
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,644
homework,
go to the bathroom.

260
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,882
Can't believe how big they are.

261
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,281
Yeah. Time's going by.

262
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,766
Must be nice for you,
having 'em here in Houston.

263
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,650
I love it, yeah. I'm
volunteering at their school.

264
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,604
Yeah? What you doing
over there?

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,923
I'm in the library. You know,
reading to the little ones.

266
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,929
Oh, great.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,525
So, Alaska, huh?

268
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,721
Yeah.

269
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,245
Are you back?

270
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,601
We'll see.

271
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,881
How's Liv?

272
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,364
She's a busy girl.

273
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,049
She's back in school.

274
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,081
But she's working
and single parenting.

275
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,003
A lot to juggle.

276
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,764
- You guys got everything?
- Yeah.

277
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,921
All right, say goodbye
to your grandmother.

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,081
Bye, Grandma.

279
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,208
All right, let's roll.
Uh, no, wait a second.

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,090
You're not the type of kids
who like presents, are you?

281
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,730
Yes!
No, you don't.

282
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,888
Of course we do. Presents?
Really? Let's do it!

283
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,286
Yay!

284
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,051
I call front seat!

285
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,326
I wanted
the front seat, though.

286
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,084
All right. Well, Mason
gets it on the way there

287
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,810
and Samantha gets it
on the way back.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,002
- Hop in there.
- Seat belts!

289
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,044
Seat belts.
All right. Seat belts.

290
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,645
Don't forget
your seat belts.

291
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,485
It's not like this car
has any seat belts.

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,201
Mmm...

293
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,643
Nice. Nice. Nice!

294
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,883
Come here, come here, yes!

295
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,008
Oh, that was awesome!

296
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,450
Get up there, Mason! Get up there!
It was so good!

297
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,760
Come on.

298
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,130
Let 'em know
who you are, buddy.

299
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,964
Let 'em know
who you are.

300
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,206
Mwah!

301
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,283
Yes! Yes! Yes!

302
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,249
All right. All right,
don't worry about it.

303
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,165
Wish we could
use the bumpers.

304
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,170
Bumpers are for kids!

305
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,163
What are you,
two years old?

306
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,810
You don't want the bumpers.

307
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,928
Life doesn't
give you bumpers.

308
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,723
There we, there we go. There we go!
We got something there!

309
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,643
We got something!
We got something!

310
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,926
Oh!

311
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,129
Last time I went bowling, we had
bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

312
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,969
You don't want the bumpers,
all right?

313
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,451
You bowl a strike
with the bumpers

314
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,090
and it doesn't
mean anything.

315
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,207
Trust me.

316
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,121
Just lay it out
on the lane.

317
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,961
One, two, three and...

318
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,681
Let's hear it
for the father!

319
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,801
Boom!

320
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,969
- Get up there!
- Great shot!

321
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,281
Get out there, girl!

322
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,889
<i>Four Blackwater
operatives have been viciously attacked</i>

323
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,450
<i>in their cars in Fallujah.</i>

324
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,888
<i>The bodies and cars were set on
fire after insurgents started...</i>

325
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,689
Look at this!
It's a disaster.

326
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,764
Let me tell you what's
happening in Iraq, all right?

327
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,366
Exactly what every thinking
person in the world

328
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,522
knew was gonna happen
before they got started.

329
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,241
But Bush and his little numb-nut
fanatics he's got around him,

330
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,560
they don't give
a rat's ass.

331
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,761
That's a quarter.

332
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,161
What's a quarter?

333
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,605
You said A-S-S.

334
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,604
Oh, sorry. My bad.

335
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,884
And my teacher says
it's a good war,

336
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,883
because it's better
to be safe than sorry.

337
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,121
That's what they're
teaching you in school?

338
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,362
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to your father, okay?

339
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,886
That is the lie.
That's the big lie.

340
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,531
Iraq had nothing to do with what
happened at the World Trade Center.

341
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,601
You know that, right?

342
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,287
I guess.

343
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,410
Who you gonna vote
for next fall, MJ?

344
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,086
I don't know.

345
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,810
He can't vote.
He's not 18.

346
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,166
All right,
who would you vote for?

347
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,521
Kerry?

348
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,171
Anybody but Bush! Okay?

349
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,163
Are you gonna move back?

350
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,444
Uh, I'm planning on it.
You know, I gotta find a job.

351
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,366
Are you and Mom
gonna get back together?

352
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,761
I don't know.

353
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,929
That's not, uh, entirely
up to me, you know?

354
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,363
I remember
when I was six,

355
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,125
you and Mom
were fighting like mad.

356
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,443
You were yelling so loud
and she was crying.

357
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,769
That's what
you remember, huh?

358
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,841
Yep-

359
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,161
You don't remember
the trips to Galveston,

360
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,481
camping in Big Bend,
all the fun we had?

361
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,561
Nope.

362
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,281
You ever get mad
at your mother?

363
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,441
Yeah.

364
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,090
You ever get mad at your brother?
 Yeah.

365
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,242
Yeah. You ever yell at him?
Oh, yeah.

366
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,527
Doesn't mean you
don't love him, right?

367
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,965
Mmm...

368
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,765
Look, the same thing happens
when you're grown up, all right?

369
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,330
You know,
you get mad at people.

370
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,721
You know,
it's not a big deal.

371
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,724
What'd you do in Alaska?

372
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,370
I worked on a boat
for a while. Um...

373
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,322
I tried to write some music.

374
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,241
Did you see
any polar bears?

375
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,368
No.
But I saw a Kodiak bear.

376
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,805
It was fuckin' huge!

377
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,929
Dad! That's 50 cents
for the F-word!

378
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,607
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,889
Here, take a dollar, all right?
Keep the change.

380
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,167
You guys are gonna be seeing
a lot more of me. Okay?

381
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,682
I missed you two real bad while I was
gone, okay, I want you to know that.

382
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,082
I just needed to take some
time, you know, to...

383
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,441
Just“

384
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,242
Your mom and me, okay...

385
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,683
Well, your mother, okay,
is a piece of work, all right.

386
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,003
I think you know that
by now, all right?

387
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,645
And I'm just...

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,571
I'm so happy to be
with the two of you, okay?

389
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,886
And I'm sorry about
that bumper business.

390
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm gonna get better
at stuff like that, okay?

391
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,844
I got that one
at Dripping Springs,

392
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,287
and, um, my friend Rodney
gave me that one.

393
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,890
- Yeah?
- And I bought that one.

394
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,405
You bought this one?
Yeah.

395
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,721
You found this at Dripping Springs?
Uh-huh.

396
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,006
Wow.

397
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,681
What else do you got?

398
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,842
Well, um,
these are snake vertebrae.

399
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,566
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting.
Huh?

400
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,769
Mason, I don't want you collecting
snake vertebrae anymore.

401
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,366
Is this the feather
l sent you?

402
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,930
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it is.

403
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,244
Oh, Dad! Um, l forgot to show you,
um, these basketball pictures.

404
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,926
You're on a basketball team?
Yeah.

405
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,411
Wow! Check you out!

406
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,811
These are beaver claws.
Beaver claws?

407
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,881
That's me.

408
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,923
Yeah. No. MASON
What, you hunting beaver?

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,764
You see, that's McKinney,
that's Meg and that's Gem.

410
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,841
Those are my friends.
Uh-huh.

411
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,081
What position
do you play?

412
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,241
Um, guard.

413
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,606
This is dried Canadian grass.
Uh-huh.

414
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,920
Wait, have you
scored any points?

415
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,161
Well, about eight
or 10 a game.

416
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,402
Eight or 10 a game?
That is awesome!

417
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,687
Once, she didn't score any
and she cried!

418
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,761
You cried?

419
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,001
Well, only a little bit.
Aw...

420
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,766
Hello!
Pomegranate.

421
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,444
Oh, Mason, Mom's home!

422
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,646
Mom's home!

423
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,846
Mom's home.

424
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,320
Mom! Hi! Look at this owl
Daddy gave me!

425
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,528
Isn't it cool?
See, its head spins!

426
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,486
And look at this bracelet. It
was made by Indians in Alaska.

427
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,127
And Daddy made this cool hand-carved
grizzly bear and this tiki.

428
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,964
- It's a totem.
- And guess what else?

429
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,169
We went bowling and I made four strikes!

430
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
Yeah, and we got to ride
around in Dad's car! Wow.

431
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,809
Hey, Liv.
Hey.

432
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,405
I know you wanted me to drop
them off at your mom's.

433
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,204
I just thought it'd be easier
if I brought 'em over here.

434
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,882
Well, it really
screwed up my plans.

435
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,130
Well, we just wanted
to show him our rooms.

436
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,247
Yeah.

437
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,321
Did you guys eat anything?

438
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,326
Well, we had some French
fries at the bowling alley.

439
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
Did you do your homework?

440
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,801
No.
Not yet.

441
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,448
Okay. Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

442
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,645
Yeah. Sure.

443
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,641
They had more
than French fries.

444
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,410
Do you think he's gonna
spend the night?

445
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,088
Doesn't look like it.

446
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,527
<i>Okay.
An unconditioned stimulus,</i>

447
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,007
<i>something that produces
an unlearned,</i>

448
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,121
involuntary,
unconditioned response.

449
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,485
Now, in Pavlov's experiment,

450
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,927
what was the stimulus
that he used?

451
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,885
Come on now, people! Tough weekend?
What's the deal here?

452
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,725
Meat, right? Meat.
Meat powder, actually.

453
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,485
Whatever meat powder is,
it worked on this dog.

454
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,085
Okay, he put
the meat powder in there

455
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,528
and it produced an unconditioned
response in the dog, which was?

456
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,250
Salivation! All right?

457
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,607
Now, who can give me
another example

458
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,160
of an unconditioned
stimulus response pair

459
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,844
that happens
to you every day?

460
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,329
It's probably happening
to some of you right now.

461
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,405
How about sex?

462
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,211
Sure, you know,

463
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,248
you see an attractive member
of the opposite gender,

464
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,367
you have
an automatic response.

465
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,487
You don't have
to think about it.

466
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,324
Mick Jagger wrote
a song about it.

467
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,805
"Oh, when
they call your name,

468
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,848
"I salivate like
a Pavlov dog."

469
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,846
Thank you very much.
Class dismissed.

470
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,364
Doctor Welbrock.

471
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,286
This is my son Mason.
Oh...

472
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,125
Mason, this is
Dr. Welbrock.

473
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,247
Your son.

474
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,129
Now see, I thought
this was a boy genius

475
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,607
who was taking my college course.

476
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,966
He wasn't feeling well today,so l
thought I'd bring him with me.

477
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,121
Uh...

478
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,005
No fever.
It's a con job.

479
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,890
I can tell because I have a nine-year-old
son, he pulls this all the time.

480
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,485
Same kind of deal.

481
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,801
Hey, you play soccer?
No.

482
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,848
Neither does my boy. He hates soccer.
He likes computers.

483
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,684
My 11-year-old daughter
loves soccer!

484
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,966
Who can figure?

485
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,804
Maybe we can get all you
guys together sometime, huh?

486
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,405
Maybe, yeah.

487
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,560
Well, you ready to go?

488
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,641
Yeah.

489
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,923
Nice to meet you, Mason.
Nice to meet you, too.

490
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,247
And thanks for
coming to my class.

491
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,241
Olivia.

492
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,009
Nice kid.
Thanks.

493
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,085
So, you think, uh, Grandma might be
available for a little babysitting?

494
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,328
Maybe.

495
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,762
Really?
Oh, yeah.

496
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,365
WELBROCK Well, great.

497
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,844
Dead man, <i>dead</i> man, wake up!

498
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,242
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, you're alive!</i>

499
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,442
My turn.
Kids, they're here!

500
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,729
- They're home, they're home!
- Come on!

501
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,131
Hurry, hurry.

502
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,691
Hi!
Hi!

503
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,131
Oh! We're here!

504
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,328
How was it? How was it?
Hey! We've returned!

505
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,004
Honey, it's so good
to see you.

506
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,765
Hi, Dad!
Samantha, Mason. Hello.

507
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,366
Thank you.
That's very nice.

508
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,442
Hey, Mom.
How are you?

509
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,766
Oh! Mom, Mom!

510
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,080
They give you trouble?
Look at the sign we made.

511
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,242
- Samantha and I made it all ourselves.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,004
I know the boys helped
you with that a lot.

513
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,003
No, not at all!

514
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,770
Okay.
There you go.

515
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,888
Pass out the goodies.
This is for the girls.

516
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,082
Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.
It's in the...

517
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,241
Let's pour.

518
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,731
You take this
big elevator up,

519
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,086
and when we got
to the top,

520
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,162
we flew
a paper airplane off.

521
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,527
- And what happened?
- It flew!

522
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,647
It flew away,
it went for miles.

523
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,325
Went under the Arc de Triomphe, you know.

524
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,648
Oh, did you guys kiss
under the Bridge of Sighs?

525
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,851
Yes.
Yes, we did.

526
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,890
Mom, can we see
your wedding ring?

527
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,291
Oh, sure.

528
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,041
WOW.

529
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,722
Technically,
that's a fancy step cut

530
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,802
surrounded by
miniature brilliant.

531
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,685
I wish we could've
gone to Europe.

532
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,807
Yeah.

533
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,405
Yeah, we'll go as
a family next time.

534
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,766
But you didn't
miss much, really.

535
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,921
We just stayed
in the hotel room

536
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,445
the whole time
playing video games.

537
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
Really?

538
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,003
And the hotels are really
small and really old.

539
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,081
Squeaky.

540
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,366
Can I get
you anything else?

541
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,771
Would you like to see
a dessert menu?

542
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,961
Listen, I told you
to put that away.

543
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,610
Would you put that
in your purse, please?

544
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,002
Computer games at the table. Yes,
uh, please, another bottle of wine.

545
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,091
- Um, Coke.
- Um, you know what?

546
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,964
Mason, you're okay
with water.

547
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,849
No more Cokes.
Thank you.

548
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,048
And how about you? Did
you finish your science project?

549
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,043
Not quite yet.

550
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,041
Well, did you work on it? Did you
build anything or plan anything or...

551
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,444
A little. Did he work
on it at all, Mindy?

552
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,801
No.

553
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,806
Did he sit around playing video
games with Mason the whole time?

554
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,211
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

555
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,290
You were supposed to finish
that by the time I got back.

556
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,407
Remember?

557
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,241
Hey-

558
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,165
Grievous is the best, man.

559
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,004
Yoda!
No, Yoda is, man!

560
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,320
Yoda! Yoda, man.

561
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,526
He has four arms.

562
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,170
Yoda, represent!

563
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,403
I hate Miss Burnsby. Everybody's
been saying she's lesbian.

564
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,922
She is. She hit on Stacey.

565
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,921
Man, that's gross.

566
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,081
Think it's true?

567
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,686
She's always walking
in the locker room.

568
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
I think I still have
a couple of those...

569
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,922
Hey, Paul, tell us a joke.

570
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,521
Damn. Fuck.
Go to hell. Ass.

571
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,521
Oh! Blew you up.

572
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,648
Heck, man.
That was not fair.

573
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,766
No, actually it was.

574
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,444
That's, like,
the fairest thing ever.

575
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,971
Where are you?

576
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,487
Ooh, once again,
I take you down.

577
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,886
<i>MASON'. The Mask?</i>

578
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,485
<i>Uh...
Three Musketeers?</i>

579
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,365
First word.

580
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,802
- Chicken. Bird.
- Chicken. Bird.

581
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,881
Second word.

582
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,169
<i>Hood. Big</i> hair. <i>Robin Hood! Ah!</i>

583
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
Brilliant child!

584
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,446
Second word.

585
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,767
MINDY; Blanket?

586
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,120
Hey,
you can't use props!

587
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,611
Hey,hey,hey!

588
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,923
Cut it out. Judges speak.
No props. No props.

589
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,129
Can't use props. You can do it without that.
Think, think, think.

590
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,690
- Um, folding.
- Bunch!

591
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,650
The Gathered? Folded.
Is it like... Um...

592
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,450
lt's just messing around
with a blanket. Wrinkling it...

593
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,646
<i>A Wrinkle In Time!
Wrinkle.</i>

594
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,165
Whoo!

595
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,363
What are the guards of Azkaban?

596
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,771
Dementors.
Ah...

597
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,528
<i>Front of the line,
are you ready?</i>

598
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,211
<i>Count down with me, ladies
and gentlemen. Ten!</i>

599
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,642
<i>Nine! Eight! Seven!</i>

600
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,963
<i>Six! Five! Four!</i>

601
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,964
<i>Three! Two! One!</i>

602
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,326
<i>Let's go!</i>

603
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,401
<i>Whoo!</i>

604
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,165
Thank you.

605
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,601
Thanks.

606
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,964
All righty. Here we go.

607
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,809
No, no, no. Back up and take a
practice swing first, remember?

608
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,770
Nice and easy. Sweep the floor.
Sweep the floor.

609
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,365
That's good.

610
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,771
Don't swing
too hard, Randy.

611
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,410
He always
swings too hard.

612
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,764
Hey! All right!
Very good!

613
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,731
Back your feet up a little bit.
Yeah, like that.

614
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,450
Now you're gonna hit
it straighter. Okay.

615
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,965
All right, go up
and hit it. That's good.

616
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,809
Nice slow swing is
gonna be better for you.

617
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,611
All right!

618
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,444
I don't know, man,
you must've been...

619
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,522
See, your feet
are too open, Randy.

620
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,602
Nice and natural.

621
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,044
Yes! Go! All right!

622
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,363
Give me five! Good
putt, son, good putt.

623
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,568
Did you see that, Randy?
That's the way to do it!

624
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,926
All right.

625
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,207
Birdie putt.

626
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,762
God damn it.
Son of a bitch.

627
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,528
Get my clubs, would you?
Get the ball.

628
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,969
This is just in case we
have guests this weekend.

629
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,130
He always says that,
but we never have guests.

630
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,250
Samantha, I think
I heard your dad pull up.

631
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,321
All right.

632
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,890
You guys finish
your chores?

633
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,411
Not quite.

634
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,210
Just about.

635
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,884
How about
the dusting, Sam?

636
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,610
I haven't done that yet.

637
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,604
Well, I saw you working
on your art project.

638
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,722
You had time to finish
your little art project,

639
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,529
but you didn't have time
to finish your chores?

640
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,721
I thought we talked
about that.

641
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,290
Dad, it's fine,
I can finish the dusting.

642
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,407
No, it's not fine, Mindy.

643
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,006
You have your own chores to
do and Sam has hers to do.

644
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,844
Huh? It's simple.

645
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,731
Poor choice there, Sam.
And hurry up.

646
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,561
Mason!

647
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,970
Your dad's here.

648
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,167
You guys aren't setting
any speed records, are you?

649
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,641
What'd you do, get about half done?
Hey, hey, hey.

650
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,287
So, did you finish?

651
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,361
No.

652
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,049
Is the job complete?

653
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,486
So, what are you
gonna be doing tomorrow?

654
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,681
Same thing, right?

655
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,564
Yeah.
Okay. Go.

656
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,926
Bye, Mom.

657
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,047
Bye,babe,
I love you.

658
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,846
Bye, Mama.

659
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,888
Bye, honey.
Have fun with your dad.

660
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,450
Just a minute, Mason.

661
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,489
The boys didn't
finish raking leaves.

662
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,562
Samantha did not
finish dusting.

663
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,843
So tomorrow,
when they come home,

664
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,160
instead of swimming
and all the other

665
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,401
little stuff that
they want to do,

666
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,606
they're going to do
their chores. Right?

667
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,681
Right.

668
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,205
Okay, guys,
you had this conversation,

669
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,486
you understand?
Tomorrow?

670
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,081
Okay-

671
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,044
Thank you. I just wanted
you to back me up on that

672
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,122
so I'm not the only one
yelling at them all the time.

673
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,202
Okay, I back you up.
You guys got that?

674
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,370
We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
Tomorrow, chores?

675
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,966
They don't hear it. Goes in
one ear and out the other.

676
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,202
But, Dad, I mean,
dusting is pointless.

677
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,203
It's not pointless,
you just don't like to do it.

678
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,842
But, I mean,
who dusts anymore?

679
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,048
You do when we ask you to!

680
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,402
And don't... Olivia, don't
let her back talk me

681
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,164
in front of the other kids,
please. Thank you.

682
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,481
Samantha, please.

683
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,606
Whatever!

684
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,886
Bye-bye.
Have a wonderful weekend.

685
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,121
Sam...

686
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,448
Okay. Bye, guys. Love you.

687
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,007
I'm sorry, but I thought
we talked about it.

688
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,969
You have to draw a line,
you have to back it up.

689
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,566
Okay. It's just you have
so many lines, Bill.

690
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,930
Everything's a line.

691
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,001
Hey, Randy!
Hey.

692
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,320
Bye.
Bye.

693
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,402
Hey, you two.
How you doing?

694
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,925
Shotgun.
Ooh!

695
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,288
Here, let me get
these bags here.

696
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,441
You doing okay,
darling?

697
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,851
Yeah.
Yeah?

698
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,450
What about you, cowboy?
Pretty good.

699
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,965
Yeah?

700
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,524
All right. Let's roll!

701
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,050
You guys ready
for the big game?

702
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,647
Yeah.

703
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,609
Sam, who are the Astros
playing tonight?

704
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,727
I don't know.

705
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,404
The Milwaukee Brewers,
all right?

706
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,606
Get to know 'em,
get to hate 'em.

707
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,524
Mason. How you been? Huh?
How was your week?

708
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,647
Pretty good.

709
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,285
Yeah? What you been up to?

710
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,285
Not much.
No?

711
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,646
You still hanging
with that kid Joe?

712
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,449
Yeah. And he's still
your best friend?

713
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,921
Yeah, I guess.

714
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,721
Okay-

715
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,040
How about you?
How was your week?

716
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,121
Fine.

717
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,725
What you been up to?

718
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,801
Nothing, really.

719
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,881
You, um, still working on
that sculpture project?

720
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,962
Yeah. Almost finished.
Yeah?

721
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,041
What's it of?

722
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,647
Nothing.

723
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,363
All right, no, no, no.

724
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,161
No, that is not how we are going
to talk to one another. All right?

725
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,165
No, I will not be that guy. You cannot
put me in that category, all right?

726
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,490
"The biological father that l
spend every other week with,

727
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,289
"and I make
polite conversation

728
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
"while he drives me places
and buys me shit."

729
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,528
No! Talk to me.

730
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,330
Samantha, how was your week?

731
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,243
"Uh, I don't know, Dad,
it was kinda tough.

732
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,163
"Billy and Ellen broke up,
and Ellen's kinda mad at me,

733
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,368
"'cause she saw me talking
to Billy in the cafeteria.

734
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,845
"And you remember that
sculpture I was working on,

735
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,206
"well, it was a unicorn,

736
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,250
"and the horn broke off,
so now it's a zebra," okay?

737
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,363
"But I still think I'm
gonna get an right?

738
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,329
Mason, uh,
how was your week?

739
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,209
"Well, Dad, you know
it was kinda tough.

740
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,123
"Joey's kind of a jerk,
actually.

741
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,441
"He stole some cigarettes from his
mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em,

742
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,885
"but I said no
because I knew

743
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,849
"what a hard time you had
quitting smoking, Dad."

744
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,763
How 'bout that?
Is that so hard?

745
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,729
Dad, these questions
are kind of hard to answer.

746
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,770
What is so hard to answer about
what sculpture are you making?

747
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,291
It's abstract.

748
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,205
Okay. Okay, that's good.

749
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,884
See, I didn't know that.

750
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,247
I didn't know you were even
interested in abstract art.

751
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,210
I'm not.
They make us do it.

752
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,487
But, Dad,
why is it all on us, though?

753
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,602
What about you?
How was your week?

754
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,966
Who do you hang out with?

755
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,281
Do you have a girlfriend?
What have you been up to?

756
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,610
I see your point.

757
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,405
So we should just let it
happen more natural, right?

758
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,050
That's what you're saying?

759
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,202
Okay, that's what we'll do.

760
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,361
Starting now.

761
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,090
Check this out.

762
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,564
That would be a...

763
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,287
That would be a Magnificent Owl.
<i>Caligo</i> atreus.

764
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,008
- What's that one? Look at this.
- Whoa!

765
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,081
What kind is that?

766
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,686
That looks like a Zebra Longwing.
All right.

767
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,841
Cool.

768
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,810
This one's incredible.
That's the owl one, right?

769
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,326
Yeah.
Magnificent Owl.

770
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,807
I think he went
pee-pee on you, bud.

771
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,848
One, two, three,
four, five.

772
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,007
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

773
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,569
Yo, Mase, look at me here. Make a
diamond with your hands, all right?

774
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,410
Fingers and thumbs.

775
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,925
Keep your hands soft.

776
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,846
Sam. Very nice.

777
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,128
That's how you want to
catch it, just like that.

778
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,201
Even when you're running,

779
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,884
that's what you're thinking
about, that diamond.

780
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,002
That diamond
and soft hands.

781
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,445
There it is.

782
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,405
No,no,no.

783
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,081
No!
Yes!

784
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,242
Don't let her get...
No, no, no!

785
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,610
Let's go, Roger!

786
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,568
That's it, Roger!
Yeah!

787
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,610
Guy's incredible.
He's unhittable this year.

788
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,641
Now, just so you know, what
we're watching here is history.

789
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,721
Now, you see
this guy out here?

790
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,844
This dude is
like 43 years old,

791
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,048
and he's striking out
guys half his age.

792
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,603
This guy's ERA is 1.47, all right?
Can you believe that?

793
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,162
Now, if the Astros could just get a
few runs, maybe we'd win a game.

794
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,963
Dad, do you
have a job?

795
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,727
Why would you
ask me that?

796
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,121
I don't know.
Morn wanted to know,

797
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,043
and I didn't know what the answer was.
Morn wanted to know.

798
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,884
All right.
Well, you can tell Mom

799
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,530
that I just happen
to have passed

800
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,484
my second actuarial exam,
all right?

801
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,961
So, tell her that.
How's she doing?

802
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,041
Is she finishing school?

803
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,121
Yep, all A's.

804
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,244
All A's, huh? Like mother,
like daughter, right?

805
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,766
He got that!
That's out...

806
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,171
Oh! Oh!

807
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,805
Yeah! Look at that!

808
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,370
Yeah!

809
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,849
Mason! Yes!

810
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,850
MASON SR; Whoo!

811
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,846
Yeah!

812
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,841
Yeah!

813
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,526
MASON SR; Whoo!

814
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,009
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Samantha!

815
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,206
Hey. What's up, Jimmy?

816
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,851
What's going on,
Mason, man?

817
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,445
Astros won.

818
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,806
You went to the game?

819
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,120
What, I'm the only one
with any arms around here?

820
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,884
Nobody else can
carry anything? Huh?

821
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,166
Help their old man out?

822
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,685
What you watching?

823
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,129
Oh, come on, Jimmy, man! You knew
the kids were coming this weekend.

824
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,124
Can't you just help
me out a little bit?

825
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,486
I'm sorry, muffin.

826
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,931
Yeah, don't
"muffin" me, all right?

827
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,047
Don't put me
in that position.

828
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,601
I'm not your fuckin'
Tony Randall.

829
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,006
Dad, it's always a mess.

830
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,771
It was not a mess
this morning. Okay?

831
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,651
I mowed the lawn.

832
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,563
Oh, yeah? Great.

833
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,124
Oh, come on, man!
Turn this shit off.

834
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,362
Come on,
give me that thing.

835
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,723
Did you watch the game?
 No.

836
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,484
Lane won it
with a three-run homer.

837
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,289
It was beautiful,
wasn't it?

838
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,083
Sam lost her mind.

839
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,764
She's a huge Astros fan.

840
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,241
Sure.

841
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,129
<i>Saturday night
was</i> a <i>lunar eclipse</i>

842
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,411
<i>I sang 'em a song
Went something like this</i>

843
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,523
<i>Well, go to sleep,
my weary babies</i>

844
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,642
<i>Let the sounds roll on by</i>

845
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,482
<i>Tonight we're safe
here in Houston</i>

846
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,962
<i>With this,
your daddy's lullaby</i>

847
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,487
<i>Your mother's got
a new husband now</i>

848
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,281
<i>He seems all right</i>

849
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,684
<i>I wonder if he's
reading them stories</i>

850
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,051
<i>And kissing them good night</i>

851
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,808
<i>Well, babysitters say
they miss me</i>

852
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,646
<i>I know
I shouldn't hope it's true</i>

853
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,885
<i>Teacher says my son
paints pictures of a family</i>

854
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,201
<i>All in blue</i>

855
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,569
<i>She says she caught him
whispering to the window</i>

856
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,370
<i>Will Daddy please come home?</i>

857
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,246
<i>I know I could call him up</i>

858
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,329
<i>But what if his mother
answers the phone?</i>

859
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,242
You brush your teeth?
What?

860
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,771
Did you brush
your teeth?

861
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,320
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

862
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,925
You gonna fall asleep with
those things in your head?

863
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,001
Maybe.

864
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,288
Yeah, well, try not to, all right?
Okay.

865
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,362
Want me to turn off the light?
Okay. Sure.

866
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,487
Good night, Sam.
Night, Dad.

867
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,961
Good night, Jimmy.

868
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,050
Hey. That was
a fun day, right?

869
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,009
Yeah, it was. Sorry.

870
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,442
Why? That Mason had to
be there, you know.

871
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,122
Good night.
Good night.

872
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,480
Dad?

873
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,763
There's no, like, real
magic in the world, right?

874
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,450
What do you mean?

875
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,004
You know,
like elves and stuff.

876
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,569
People just made that up.

877
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,131
Oh, I don't know.

878
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,370
I mean, what makes you think
that elves are any more magical

879
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,442
than something
like a whale?

880
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,322
You know what I mean? What
if I told you a story about

881
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,562
how underneath the ocean,

882
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,611
there was this
giant sea mammal

883
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,570
that used sonar
and sang songs

884
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,486
and it was so big that its
heart was the size of a car

885
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,370
and you could crawl
through the arteries?

886
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,967
I mean, you'd think that
was pretty magical, right?

887
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,405
Yeah.

888
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,928
But, like,
right this second,

889
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,085
there's, like, no elves
in the world, right?

890
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,451
No. Technically,
no elves.

891
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,848
Love you, guys. All right.
Be well. See you, Dad.

892
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,284
Have a great week. Sam,
I'll see you next weekend?

893
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,044
All right. Oh, yeah, that's right.
What?

894
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,122
Suzy has a birthday party
next Saturday.

895
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,201
A sleepover?
Yeah.

896
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,044
All right. I'll talk
to your mom about it.

897
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,281
Bye,Dad.
Don't worry about it, okay?

898
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,283
Have a great week. Okay.
Had a great time.

899
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,325
Oh, man.

900
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,768
How do you guys not know how to do this?

901
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,043
I'll make you some bookmarks.
Just a second. Pictures...

902
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,324
Ooh. She looks nice.

903
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,368
Randy, Mason, Dad wants
you guys downstairs.

904
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,521
Why?
You're getting haircuts.

905
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,450
This is gonna
look so much better.

906
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,883
You're gonna look like a man,
instead of like a little girl.

907
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,724
You're taking the eyebrows
off next, right, Byron?

908
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,963
Mason, we're leaving.

909
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,850
You're not sick.

910
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,208
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Mom.

911
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,560
Where's Mason?

912
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,802
He doesn't feel too good. I don't
think he's going to school.

913
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,281
He's totally faking it.

914
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,926
Bye.

915
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,642
Mason, what's going on?

916
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,845
I don't feel good.

917
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,126
Yeah, well,
your head feels fine.

918
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,645
<i>So get your ass
out of bed.</i>

919
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,841
I'm gonna drive
you to school.

920
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,571
You got five minutes,
and don't make me late.

921
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,048
I mean, he didn't even ask!
He just cut it.

922
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,125
It's my hair!

923
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,244
Well, no wonder you were angry.
I'd be angry, too.

924
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,522
I look like a Martian now.

925
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,328
Honey, you know what? I'm gonna
talk to him about it later. Okay?

926
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,649
Yeah, I tried to call you, but
you didn't answer your phone.

927
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,883
I'm so sorry. I've been
so busy with school.

928
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,887
For what it's worth, it's
hair and it will grow back.

929
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,485
And now I can see your pretty
eyes and your foxy face.

930
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,043
Why did you even marry him?

931
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,201
He's such a jerk!

932
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,086
Well, Bill has
his good qualities.

933
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,285
You know, nobody's perfect.
And now we have a family.

934
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,050
We already had a family.

935
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,250
I pledge allegiance
to the flag

936
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,164
of the United States
of America...

937
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,449
...and to the
Republic for which it stands,

938
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,765
one nation, under God,

939
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,731
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

940
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,531
Please join me
in the Texas Pledge.

941
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,921
Honor the Texas flag.

942
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,526
I pledge allegiance to thee,

943
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,371
Texas one and indivisible.

944
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,210
Thank you.
You may be seated.

945
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,925
All right.

946
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,290
All right, class,
as you know,

947
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,522
we've been working on
our mythology projects,

948
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,331
and you're going to be writing
papers about gods and goddesses.

949
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,051
We've listed those gods and
goddesses here on the board.

950
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,531
We added a couple
of monsters

951
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,887
for some of you who might
be interested in that.

952
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,327
And you're going to write your
essay about your god and goddess,

953
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,129
and to make sure that
you cover everything,

954
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,726
let's make sure that we do all
of these things right here.

955
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,282
First of all, you need to name
your god or goddess,

956
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,530
and you need to include who,
what, when, where, why and how.

957
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,484
So make sure that
you cover all those things

958
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,244
when you're writing
your essay.

959
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,568
There's a bump
right there.

960
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,286
I'll see you later, guys.

961
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,486
Yeah.

962
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,762
- Mom, are you okay?
- What happened?

963
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,841
No.

964
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,367
Go in the house! Go! Go in the house!
Go in the house!

965
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,011
Your mother
had a little accident.

966
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,168
Now she's being dramatic.

967
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,047
Get off the fucking floor, Olivia.
For Christ's sake!

968
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,843
I'm having a drink
with my dinner.

969
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,366
Anybody else have
a problem with that?

970
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,721
Hmm?

971
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,883
Samantha?
No.

972
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,486
Mindy?

973
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,561
No.

974
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,887
I didn't think So.

975
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,363
You don't like me
much, do you, Mason?

976
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,562
That's okay. I don't like me either.

977
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,204
You think
that's funny? Huh?

978
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,046
You think that's fuckin' funny?

979
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,440
What's the matter, you
feeling a little left out?

980
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,802
Clean it up, God damn it!
Clean it up.

981
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,406
Bill! Clean it up, God damn it!

982
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,970
I hate squash!

983
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,081
Pearl.

984
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,685
<i>I'm gonna pay you.</i>

985
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,091
<i>I'm working
three jobs right now.</i>

986
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,640
How many times can
you watch that, Mason?

987
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,809
It's funny.
I'm driving a cab.

988
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,163
<i>I'm inside with my buddy right
now just going over my résumé.</i>

989
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,288
<i>Okay, you know what?
You need to relax.</i>

990
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,724
<i>Look, why do you need your
money so fast? Come on.</i>

991
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,644
- Has he ever gotten this bad before?
- No.

992
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,370
But he's yelled a lot.

993
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,410
Yeah, but he hasn't
thrown and broken stuff.

994
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,086
Yeah.
You're drunk. <i>I</i> knew it.

995
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,089
<i>You're already drunk.</i>

996
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,402
Give me
your cell phones.

997
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,762
So nobody talked
to her, huh?

998
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,087
Mason?

999
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,121
No.

1000
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,208
Mindy?
No.

1001
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,281
I believe you.

1002
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,967
Samantha?

1003
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,041
No.

1004
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,042
I didn't talk to her.
She left a message.

1005
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,447
What'd she say?

1006
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,201
Nothing much.

1007
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,565
What did she say?

1008
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,210
She said
she'd be back later.

1009
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,848
And that's all,
"I'll be back later," click?

1010
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,448
She said, "Stay in your rooms.
I'll be back later."

1011
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,569
I'll be back later, stay in your rooms.
And that's all? Hmm?

1012
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,921
Yeah.

1013
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,047
Where is she?

1014
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,811
I don't know.
Where is she?

1015
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,881
She didn't say!

1016
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,366
All right. Everybody,
get in the car.

1017
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,642
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

1018
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,090
It's still not working.

1019
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,241
WELBROCK Oh, bullshit.

1020
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,205
She took it all.

1021
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,921
All right, Randy,
go cash this.

1022
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,121
Tell them I'm not feeling well or something.
I don't know.

1023
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,204
Mason, go with him.

1024
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,561
Here. There's my ID.

1025
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,731
Hi, good afternoon, fellas.
What can I do for you today?

1026
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,927
Now what's this?

1027
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,570
Can't read this.

1028
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,766
Hey!

1029
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,440
This isn't you!
Who is this?

1030
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,765
It's our dad.

1031
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,129
He's not feeling well.

1032
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,402
Oh! Hey! Yeah, I know him.
Okay, here we go.

1033
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,886
Five hundred bucks.

1034
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,611
One, two, three, four...

1035
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,920
Five hundred bucks.
All right?

1036
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,408
Don't forget your dad's ID.

1037
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,888
Now take care of your dad now, son.
You only got the one.

1038
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,046
WELBROCK Damn it.

1039
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,610
Get outta the way.
Jesus Christ.

1040
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,366
God...

1041
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,245
Calm down!

1042
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,367
Samantha! Mason!

1043
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,167
Samantha!

1044
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,245
Where the hell
have you been?

1045
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,765
I'm leaving you, Bill.
We're moving out.

1046
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,725
I doubt that.

1047
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,325
Samantha, Mason!
Come down!

1048
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,290
No, mmm-mmm, don't think so.
Oh, who's this?

1049
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,010
- I'm not here for you!
- Oh, really?

1050
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,408
Oh, I know, you're here
to protect my wife from me.

1051
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,000
Well, thank you so much, you two.
Okay, stay back!

1052
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,561
Why don't you come inside here?
Huh? Come inside here.

1053
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,051
Where the hell
are you going?

1054
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,122
Get your ass upstairs!
You're not going anywhere.

1055
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,770
Stop! Come on!

1056
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,085
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Get upstairs!

1057
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,650
What the hell... Nobody's
going anywhere, God damn it!

1058
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,370
No, God damn it!
Stop it.

1059
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,606
Don't touch my kids!

1060
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,920
All right, take 'em.
Go on, go on.

1061
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,161
- Don't touch them!
- Take 'em.

1062
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,240
Take 'em then, just take 'em!
Get in the car.

1063
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,367
Go!

1064
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,005
Get upstairs! Olivia!

1065
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,686
Seat belts! Put your seat belts on.

1066
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,646
Where are we going?

1067
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,604
We're going to stay with Carol
and her family for a while.

1068
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,044
Don't look back.

1069
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,164
It's gonna be okay.

1070
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,405
<i>And</i> we see that

1071
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,643
<i>We're all in this together</i>

1072
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,963
<i>And it shows
When we stand hand in hand</i>

1073
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,688
Hey, Lee and Mason.
Guys, when you want

1074
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,728
to take a break,
here's a snack.

1075
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,167
...going on...

1076
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,450
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it loud</i>

1077
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,284
<i>Wildcats everywhere</i>

1078
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,964
<i>Wave your hands
up in the air</i>

1079
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,289
Abby, why don't you
come and help me with this?

1080
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,244
Why couldn't Randy
and Mindy come with us?

1081
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,849
I'm not their
legal guardian, honey.

1082
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,161
That would be kidnapping.
I can't just...

1083
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,844
What's gonna happen
to them?

1084
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,242
What happens when their legal
guardian is dangerous and abusive?

1085
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,004
I don't know, honey.

1086
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,289
I called their mom. I called
the Child Protective Services.

1087
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,086
I have you and your brother.

1088
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,685
We are in
a dangerous situation.

1089
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,524
You're my responsibility.

1090
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,248
Are we ever gonna
see them again?

1091
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,006
I don't know.

1092
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,320
I hope so.

1093
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,640
How much longer
are we gonna be here?

1094
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,570
Not long. We're...

1095
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,971
I don't...

1096
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,128
I don't know. I don't
have the answer, baby.

1097
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,926
Listen.

1098
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,810
We are happy to have you
here as long as you want.

1099
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,404
As long as you need.

1100
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,881
This is fun for us, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.

1101
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,326
Yeah, it's like
having a big sister?

1102
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,650
Like having a brother.

1103
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,131
We're gonna
help out, right?

1104
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,690
You're not even gonna
know we're here.

1105
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,205
Okay.

1106
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,048
Mom, this is awful.

1107
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,805
You're dumping me in some
parking lot of this school

1108
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,370
where I don't
even know anyone!

1109
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,923
I'm leaving all my friends, and I
didn't even get to say goodbye!

1110
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,365
I don't know where to go!

1111
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,968
Samantha, you go
right through that door.

1112
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,929
The office is right there.
They're expecting you.

1113
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,081
They're gonna give you
your schedule.

1114
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,321
Here's your lunch money.

1115
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,085
I will pick you up
right here at 3:30.

1116
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,207
I'm wearing dirty clothes because you
wouldn't even let us get our stuff!

1117
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,850
We don't even have
a place to live!

1118
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,361
This sucks!

1119
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,127
Samantha, I'm doing
the best I can!

1120
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,283
And you're right,
it sucks!

1121
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,603
But it doesn't suck half as
much as having a drunk fool

1122
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,370
slam your head
against a wall!

1123
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,769
So cut your
horseshit attitude!

1124
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,729
Put your seat belt on!

1125
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,683
You know, if you need anything,
I'm in Room 112, right?

1126
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,761
Okay-

1127
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,008
This is Mrs. Darby's room.

1128
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,969
Oh, honey,
it's gonna be okay.

1129
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,166
Mom.

1130
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,442
Dude,
did you see that?

1131
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,369
That concert was awful.

1132
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,081
Hook, I mean, when he smashed that
board against that microphone...

1133
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,923
Are you Mason?
Yeah.

1134
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,890
Hi, I'm Mrs. Darby.
I'm glad to meet you.

1135
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,883
Why don't you sit here?

1136
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,681
Kenny! Off.

1137
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,761
Yes, ma'am.

1138
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,208
Kenny, this is Mason,

1139
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,089
and I want you to show
him around today,okay?

1140
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,805
Got it.

1141
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,041
Hey, dude.
Welcome to the suck.

1142
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,562
Everybody, listen up!

1143
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,401
We have a new student
joining us today.

1144
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,448
His name is Mason,
he's sitting in the back row.

1145
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,684
Kenny's going to be his buddy,
but I want each one of you

1146
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,001
to take the time today
to introduce yourselves

1147
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,010
and welcome him
to school. Okay?

1148
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,687
All right?
Let's get started.

1149
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,726
What?

1150
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,961
Oh, hi.

1151
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,725
Can I put an Obama sign
in your yard?

1152
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,849
Do I look like a Barack
Hussein Obama supporter?

1153
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,127
No.

1154
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,162
This is private property.
Get off.

1155
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,241
I could shoot you!

1156
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,806
What a dick.

1157
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,928
He had a Confederate flag
on his house.

1158
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,481
I love it.

1159
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,171
Young Obama supporters out
on the trail, this is great!

1160
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,124
Are you doing this
through your school?

1161
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,770
Um, our dad's
a big supporter.

1162
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,081
Oh, that's great.

1163
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,926
I mean, we have just got to pull
together to get this win, right?

1164
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,001
Yeah.

1165
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,162
Ah, I just
love him so much!

1166
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,930
I have these dreams
where I'm just kissing him,

1167
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,286
'cause I just
love him so much!

1168
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,646
He's so cute, isn't he?

1169
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,960
Yeah.

1170
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,089
You know, I made these
T-shirts for my kids.

1171
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,924
"My Mama's For Obama."

1172
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,007
Do you like it?
Yeah.

1173
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,764
- It's good, right?
-  Yeah.

1174
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,047
- Thanks for the sign!
- No problem.

1175
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,449
All right! Looks good!

1176
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,607
How many
you got left, two?

1177
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,330
All right, all right, we're done.
Let's get out of here.

1178
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,811
Come on, Sam.

1179
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,041
Go get that McCain sign,
would you?

1180
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,403
What? Get the McCain sign.
Go rip it up, come on.

1181
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,040
Get it, get it, get it,
90.90,90!

1182
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,170
Good job, good job.
Proud of you, son.

1183
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,205
You guys
are gonna get us arrested.

1184
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,520
Look,
I'm a patriot, all right?

1185
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,251
And sometimes in this life
you gotta fight.

1186
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,087
And what is it that you do
at these parties?

1187
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,405
I don't know. Talk,
dance, listen to music.

1188
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,847
Uh-huh. And that's more fun
to you than going camping

1189
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,526
with your brother and
your father who love you.

1190
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,080
Yes. Sorry.

1191
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,765
Wow. ls there gonna
be alcohol there?

1192
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,080
Probably not.

1193
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,921
- Maybe some of the seniors.
Mmm-hmm.

1194
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,570
I know what this party is.

1195
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,927
The parents are
out of town, right?

1196
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,002
Somebody's scored
a keg, right?

1197
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,686
You guys are gonna have a good
time, trash the whole house.

1198
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,841
Right? Am I right?
No.

1199
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,161
No, Dad.
Amy's really responsible.

1200
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,526
Mmm-hmm.

1201
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,606
Who's gonna be there?

1202
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,687
Marie, Christine, Amy.
Everyone.

1203
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,810
Is that guy on your Facebook
page, is he gonna be there?

1204
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,521
Who?

1205
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,410
Come on, the guy that's got
his arm wrapped around you,

1206
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,050
with his hair
over his eyes.

1207
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,201
Garret?

1208
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,282
Garret. Is that his name?
All right.

1209
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,442
Is Garret gonna be there?

1210
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,601
Probably.

1211
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,010
Probably. Uh-huh.
You see?

1212
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,364
I learn more about her
from her Facebook page

1213
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,284
than I do from our
scintillating conversation.

1214
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,486
Is he your boyfriend?

1215
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,641
Kind of.

1216
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,448
Have you met him? Has he
been around the house?

1217
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,567
Sometimes.

1218
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,324
Sometimes? Zzz?

1219
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,331
You have a boyfriend!

1220
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,201
Wow.

1221
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,765
Have you heard
of Sarah Palin?

1222
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,251
Yes.

1223
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,685
What's the one thing
you know about

1224
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,046
Sarah Palin's
17-year-old daughter?

1225
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,770
She's pregnant?
That's right.

1226
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,611
And what is the one thing
that you are not going to be

1227
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,921
in a couple of years
when you turn 17?

1228
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,722
Pregnant?
That's right!

1229
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,524
All right, now,
what are the two ways

1230
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,926
that you can achieve
that goal?

1231
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,366
First is

1232
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,409
not have any sex, okay?

1233
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,841
That's the first way, okay?
Just not engage in that.

1234
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,207
That did not work out very
well for your mother and me.

1235
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,250
And what's the second way?

1236
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,486
Where you going?
Bathroom.

1237
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,607
You don't have to go
to the bathroom.

1238
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,126
Sit down, Mason,
just sit down.

1239
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,601
What's the second way?

1240
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,281
Huh?

1241
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,044
Has your mother talked to
you guys about this stuff?

1242
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,121
No,Dad!

1243
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,725
No, come on, has she
talked to you about

1244
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,051
contraception?

1245
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,641
Huh?

1246
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,370
What, has she...
Condoms?

1247
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,283
She talked about that?
No, Dad, please, stop.

1248
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,521
What?

1249
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,211
Does Garret have a condom?
Oh, God!

1250
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,805
Dad!  What? Come on.

1251
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,848
Sam, we have to be able to
talk about this, all right?

1252
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,684
Come on, we do. We can
do it, we can do it.

1253
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,330
Just stay with me here,
all right?

1254
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,131
It's as hard for me as it is for you.
But seriously, all right?

1255
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,680
I read an article in the paper
the other day that said

1256
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,049
that although US teenagers are
not the most sexually active,

1257
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,681
we have the highest rate
of teenage pregnancy, okay?

1258
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,081
Hey-

1259
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,810
Oh, hey, Tammy, how you doing?
What's going on?

1260
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,847
Nice to see you.

1261
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,530
Oh, yeah, good to see you. Yeah.

1262
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,568
Um, Tammy, this is my
daughter Samantha. Hey.

1263
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,369
And this is, uh,
Mason Junior right here.

1264
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,641
- Mason Junior.
- Tammy.

1265
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,687
Say hi.
Hi.

1266
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,684
Hi, Mason, nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you guys.

1267
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,330
What're you doing here?

1268
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,845
I'm just here
with some friends.

1269
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,843
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

1270
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,967
What are you guys up to?

1271
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,166
Um, we're going camping.

1272
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,208
Well, no, this one
is not going camping.

1273
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,770
This one is going
to a party.

1274
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,410
Oh, fun.

1275
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,364
But we, the men,
are going camping.

1276
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,720
The boys are going camping.

1277
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,245
All right, very nice.

1278
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,009
Well, uh, we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1279
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,048
No, I'll drop him off at 7:00
and then I'll just call you.

1280
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,167
Okay.
Right?

1281
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,362
Great. It was really
nice meeting you both.

1282
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,441
Take care.

1283
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,768
Talk to you soon. Bye. I'll see you.
I'll see you.

1284
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,561
Don't look at me
like that, all right?

1285
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,961
Look, just to finish
the point, okay?

1286
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,570
I was 23 when your mom had you, all right?
So was she.

1287
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,846
All right, and we didn't
put ourselves

1288
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,844
in the best position
to be great parents.

1289
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,804
And I wish that...

1290
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,286
I wish I were a better parent
to you guys, all right?

1291
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,251
And I hope that you
can learn from my mistakes, okay?

1292
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,721
All right. So wear a condom, okay?
Oh!

1293
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,087
Or get Garret to...

1294
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,286
I don't know,
whatever.

1295
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,842
Listen to this song,
all right?

1296
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,807
<i>I try to stay busy</i>

1297
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,320
Just straight-up...
The lyrics in this,

1298
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,084
straight-up
old-school country song.

1299
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,811
<i>I do the dishes
I mow the lawn</i>

1300
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,844
Listen to
the production of this.

1301
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,764
Production's like
<i>Abbey</i> Road or something.

1302
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,400
<i>Even though I know
You're not coming home</i>

1303
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,766
You know,
his old woman's gone.

1304
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,842
Straight-up.
Nothing fancy.

1305
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,526
<i>I try to keep
the house nice and neat</i>

1306
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,964
<i>Make my bed
I change the sheets</i>

1307
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,407
<i>I even learned how to use
the washing machine</i>

1308
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,851
<i>Keeping things clean
Doesn't change anything</i>

1309
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,282
Yeah, I think she's about
to get her master's degree.

1310
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,283
Well, then she's gonna start
applying for teaching jobs?

1311
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,600
I think she already has.

1312
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,886
Really? Where?

1313
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,086
All over.

1314
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,568
All over Texas?
Yeah.

1315
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,211
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
move, you know? It's no big deal.

1316
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:45,364
We can handle that. I'll still
come get you every other weekend.

1317
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,842
I mean, unless she moves
500 miles away or something,

1318
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,490
it'll just be a little bit
more car time.

1319
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,800
No big deal.

1320
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,166
I'm just kind of
sick of moving.

1321
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,685
Well, I bet you are.

1322
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,761
But, you know,
you never know.

1323
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,330
I might have
to move. Right?

1324
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,323
I'm working for this
insurance company now.

1325
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,562
These places get bought
and sold all the time.

1326
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,086
You know,
we'll just roll with it.

1327
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,565
I thought you were
a musician.

1328
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,766
I am,

1329
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,926
but life is expensive,
you know?

1330
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,562
Guy's got to
be responsible.

1331
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,766
What do you think?

1332
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,046
Hey! Hey!

1333
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,001
Oh. you!

1334
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,560
Punk kid!
You got no respect!

1335
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,050
You know that redhead
at the bowling alley?

1336
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,407
Sure.
What about her?

1337
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,886
Do you
know her well?

1338
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,440
Uh, you know,
we've hung out a little bit.

1339
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,568
Is she your girlfriend?

1340
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,724
How do you mean?

1341
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,928
Like, have you kissed her?

1342
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,521
Um...

1343
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,368
Yeah. Yeah,
I've kissed her.

1344
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,888
What about you?
Have you got a girlfriend?

1345
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,286
Sort of.

1346
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,841
Really?

1347
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,962
Have you, uh,
kissed her?

1348
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,451
Not really.

1349
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,969
Yeah? What have you done?

1350
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,246
Well,
we talked on the phone.

1351
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,367
0h. yeah!

1352
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,771
How did that go?

1353
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,887
Pretty terrible.

1354
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,281
Why?

1355
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,324
Well, when we're at school,
we got plenty to talk about,

1356
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,084
but when we're alone
or on the phone,

1357
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,889
it's like we have
nothing in common.

1358
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,166
Nothing?

1359
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,008
She's not interested in
music or video games or...

1360
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,370
Three best movies this summer.
Right.

1361
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,204
<i>Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight
and Pineapple Express.</i>

1362
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,089
Yeah, what about 'em?
She said they all sucked.

1363
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,043
Okay, what's she
interested in?

1364
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,321
I don't know.

1365
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,721
Going to the mall with her
stupid friends?

1366
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,723
Well, is she cute?
Watch your step there.

1367
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,404
Yeah.
Yeah? All right.

1368
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,051
Well, here's what
you do, all right?

1369
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,611
First off, you gotta
ask her a lot of questions.

1370
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,523
Then you have to listen to
the answers, all right?

1371
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,080
Actually be interested
in her, all right?

1372
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,366
If you can
do those things,

1373
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,250
you're gonna be light years
ahead of all the other guys.

1374
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,161
Okay. This is the best s'more I
ever made in my life, all right?

1375
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,442
This is absolute peak. Look at this.
Yeah. Yeah.

1376
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,761
Honey brown, no burn.

1377
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,887
Look at that, huh?

1378
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,442
Sell that in the store.
Mmm.

1379
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,921
That's like advertisement worthy.
Mmm-hmm.

1380
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,240
Advertisement quality.

1381
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,401
Yeah.

1382
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,241
Mmm.

1383
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,529
You think they ever will
make another Star Wars?

1384
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,763
I don't know. I think if they
were gonna make another one,

1385
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,490
that the period
where this game is set

1386
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,005
is where
it would have to be,

1387
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,242
'cause there's
nothing after, really.

1388
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,607
Yeah. No, Return of the <i>Jedi,</i> it's over.
There's nothing...

1389
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,886
Yeah, there's nothing else
to do there.

1390
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,446
You gonna turn Han Solo into a Sith Lord?

1391
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,806
Yeah. What are you gonna do?
Right.

1392
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,523
Good morning.
Morning.

1393
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,206
You gotta pee?

1394
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,281
Sure.
Mmm-hmm.

1395
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,210
Hit the campfire.

1396
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,567
Ancient Native
American custom.

1397
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,967
You're gonna give back to the
Earth what you take from it,

1398
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,247
and you don't burn
the forest down.

1399
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,281
Okay, guys,
have a good day!

1400
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,888
Mason, don't forget,
I have to teach late today.

1401
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,644
Sam's gonna pick you up.
Right, Sam? Yeah.

1402
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,842
All right.
Okay. Bye, guys.

1403
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,160
See you.

1404
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,361
Hey.

1405
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,204
That's what I was
talking to you about.

1406
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,089
Yeah. Good luck with that.

1407
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,605
See you, man.

1408
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,165
Don't bump into me!
Little bitch!

1409
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,247
I didn't!

1410
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,731
You calling me a liar?

1411
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,801
No.

1412
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,448
Don't act like you're
tough shit, motherfucker.

1413
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,843
I don't think pretty boy's
hair's good enough.

1414
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,768
Don't touch me, faggot!

1415
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,164
You're a fuckin' asshole.

1416
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,361
<i>Hey, Mason!</i>

1417
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,487
<i>MASON'. Hey, Jill.</i>

1418
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,249
So, where're you going?

1419
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,446
Over to the college.

1420
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,285
What's going on there?

1421
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,691
My mom's a teacher.

1422
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,366
Oh, cool.
What does she teach?

1423
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,768
Psychology, I think.

1424
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,246
What're you up to?

1425
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,970
Oh, my mom
owns Needleworks.

1426
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,769
The arts and crafts
store over there.

1427
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,450
So I'm just
kinda hangin' out.

1428
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,409
But I'm supposed to be going
to the hospital soon.

1429
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,766
How come?

1430
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,844
You know Courtney?

1431
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,242
Girl with the dyed black hair
and the nose ring?

1432
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,651
Wears Hot Topic
every day?

1433
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,210
I think so.

1434
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,008
We used to be
best friends growing up,

1435
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,923
but we've kind of
grown apart.

1436
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,088
She sorta got all emo,
she thinks I'm a prep,

1437
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,969
but I still consider
her a friend.

1438
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,451
Anyway, she cut
one of her wrists.

1439
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,285
I don't know how bad, but I
think I should go visit.

1440
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,404
So what're you reading?

1441
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,563
Uh, it's Breakfast of Champions.
Kurt Vonnegut.

1442
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,726
I think my older brother
likes him.

1443
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,681
<i>I'm reading To Kill</i> a
<i>Mockingbird for the</i> third <i>time.</i>

1444
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,250
My friends
make fun of me.

1445
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,129
I think I'm the only girl
in the whole school

1446
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,929
who doesn't like
the Twilight books.

1447
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,161
Have you read 'em?

1448
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,366
Sure haven't.

1449
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,085
I tried,

1450
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,844
but it was so cheesy!

1451
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,442
So, how do you
like San Marcos?

1452
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,369
I like it all right.

1453
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,081
It's a lot smaller than Houston,
but it seems pretty cool.

1454
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,520
Have you always
lived here?

1455
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,726
Yeah.

1456
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,131
If you want
the big city around here,

1457
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,601
you have to drive
to San Antonio or Austin.

1458
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,489
Have you been there yet?

1459
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,369
I went to San Antonio
for a day,

1460
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,966
but I haven't been
to Austin yet.

1461
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,843
That's where all
the high school kids go

1462
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,763
on weekends
for shows and stuff.

1463
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,689
That's what I've heard.

1464
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,808
So, are you going to
Shauna's party next weekend?

1465
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,969
Um, I think I heard about it.
I'm not really sure, though.

1466
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,121
Well, you should!

1467
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,440
Why's that?

1468
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,802
Well, LeeAnne has
a big crush on you,

1469
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,247
and I know she was
hoping you would go.

1470
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,209
You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

1471
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,327
Not currently.

1472
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,970
Well then,
you should come.

1473
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,565
I'll tell Chase to
make sure you're there.

1474
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,801
Okay-

1475
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,122
But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.
She'd kill me.

1476
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,486
I won't.

1477
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,725
Well, I better get going.

1478
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,211
See you later.
Bye.

1479
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,083
His cognitive theories,
his interviews with orphans,

1480
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,562
ethology theorists' work,

1481
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,971
and then he in turn

1482
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,527
was supported strongly by Harry
Harlow's rhesus monkey study.

1483
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,570
Now, you guys,
you gotta think,

1484
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,961
this is the 1950s,
this was radical!

1485
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,970
This flew in the face of
traditional learning theory,

1486
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,681
of B.F. Skinner's classical
and instrumental conditioning.

1487
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,887
Now, Bowlby's
gonna argue that

1488
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,443
human survival depends
on us falling in love.

1489
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,327
It depends on me falling
in love with my mother

1490
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,367
and my mother
falling in love with me.

1491
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,522
And if that doesn't happen,

1492
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,965
we're pretty much doomed.

1493
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,726
Now think about it.

1494
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,724
A tiger chases her tribe
out of a cave

1495
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,846
Now, an ideal mother goes,

1496
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,691
"My baby! I love you,
I'll protect you!"

1497
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,685
Or, "Well, you, why am I gonna pick you up?
You're gonna slow me down.

1498
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,281
"You are
tiger kibble!"

1499
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,924
So, next week,
we are gonna get into

1500
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,446
Bowlby's four stages
of attachment.

1501
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,370
Oh, oh... Uh, Professor
Douglas and I...

1502
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,010
Some of you might
have classes with Elena.

1503
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,448
She and I are hosting a little
pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place,

1504
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,484
so if anyone wants to come,
please stop by.

1505
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,082
I'm not the greatest cook.

1506
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,200
Thanks.

1507
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,331
Samantha!

1508
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,806
Why the hell didn't you pick up your
brother like you said you would?

1509
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,803
Okay. Mom... Morn, I know
what you're gonna say.

1510
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,321
She was running late
and we couldn't turn around.

1511
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,640
No, no! No excuses!

1512
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,564
The bottom line is you didn't do
what you said you were gonna do!

1513
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,324
You stranded your brother!

1514
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,051
It's embarrassing to ask
my friend to turn around

1515
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,726
and go get some kid
at the middle school.

1516
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,768
What do you mean "some kid"?
He's your brother!

1517
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,528
And you know what? We've
helped Janey out before.

1518
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,206
She lives right around the corner.
It's no big deal.

1519
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,486
Sorry.

1520
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,441
You know what, Samantha?

1521
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,683
You need to start thinking long
and hard about who you wanna be.

1522
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,206
Do you wanna be
a cooperative person

1523
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,767
who's compassionate and
helps people out...

1524
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,683
...or do you wanna be
a self-centered narcissist?

1525
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,082
You know what? You're right.
lam this horrible person.

1526
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,686
But, honestly,
he's not a baby anymore.

1527
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,285
You don't have to
treat him like one.

1528
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,126
He's in eighth grade, and he can
find his way home if he wants to.

1529
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,409
You know what?

1530
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,404
When Gabi leaves, you and
me are gonna have a chat.

1531
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,766
Awkward.

1532
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,724
Dude, that sucks.

1533
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,040
Hey, man, what's up?

1534
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,406
Hey. We're going
camping tonight.

1535
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,561
You in?

1536
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,721
Uh. Who's going?

1537
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,804
My brother, one of his
friends, and Tony maybe.

1538
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,201
Yeah, let me check
with my mom.

1539
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,320
Mom, can I go camping
with Chase tonight?

1540
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,801
Camping? Where?

1541
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,169
Uh, at that house that his family's building.
It's pretty much finished.

1542
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,846
Well, will any adults
be there?

1543
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,720
His brother's a senior.

1544
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,129
You have your cell phone?
Yeah.

1545
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,770
Is it charged?
Mmm-hmm.

1546
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,841
Okay, do me a favor.

1547
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,241
Leave his parents' number and
the address on the counter.

1548
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,487
Okay-

1549
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,407
Yeah! What
I'm talking about!

1550
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,481
That's it.

1551
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,561
You ready?
Check this shit out.

1552
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,325
That was all right, but
this is gonna be badass.

1553
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,050
All right, let me see.
Let me see what you can do.

1554
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,009
All right.
This is your face.

1555
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,362
I'm about to break
his face, right here.

1556
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,011
All right, man. All right, now check this out.
You might want to move.

1557
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,284
Ow, that'd be painful.

1558
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,286
In the kidneys, right?
The stomach? Something.

1559
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,125
Oh!

1560
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,001
Check this out, man.

1561
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,129
Pancreas.

1562
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,521
That shit's lethal.

1563
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,409
Yeah,
that would be painful.

1564
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,847
Man, have a beer, man.
That was awesome. Here.

1565
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,126
It's beer 30, children.

1566
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,361
Nice.

1567
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,521
Uh, no, thanks.

1568
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,681
Come on, man.

1569
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,450
What are you?
A pussy?

1570
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,727
I just don't feel like
drinking a beer right now.

1571
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,481
Man, if you're too chickenshit
to even have a beer,

1572
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,722
I know for a fact that you
have never gotten any pussy.

1573
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,048
Like you guys have.

1574
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,121
Sure have.

1575
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,201
When?

1576
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,527
Last summer.

1577
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,848
- With who?
- It was awesome.

1578
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,571
Chase went down easy street
and fucked this whore Nancy.

1579
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,681
At least,
that's what he said.

1580
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,125
I did. Would I lie?

1581
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,804
Bullshit. Quick,
where were you?

1582
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,086
At Taber's house.

1583
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,288
And she fucked
a couple other guys, too.

1584
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,045
Oh, man, his first piece
of ass was sloppy seconds.

1585
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,082
What about you, Mason?
You ever got any?

1586
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,640
Yeah, you ever made her, uh,
howl into the night?

1587
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,603
A few times.
Really?

1588
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,680
Yeah, right, what was her name?
Lucky?

1589
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,011
No.Jennfien

1590
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,764
She doesn't live here, though.
She's back in Houston.

1591
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,445
You're fucking lying.

1592
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,404
I don't care if you assholes
believe me or not.

1593
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,369
Let me guess, you were pulling
all kinds of ass back home,

1594
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,284
but once you got
down here, lefty.

1595
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,566
Hey, fuck you.

1596
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,449
I would, but none of
the girls here want to.

1597
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,285
Dude, it's not what they want,
man, it's what you want.

1598
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,931
True dat.

1599
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,048
You know what you
should do, join a band.

1600
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,645
That's all it takes, man.

1601
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,768
Oh,yeah?
Fuck,yeah,dude.

1602
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,604
You don't even have
to play that well.

1603
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,045
You start playing
your instrument,

1604
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,202
and they line up
to give you blowjobs.

1605
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,401
Except for you.

1606
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,606
It doesn't impress
the ladies so much

1607
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,364
when you play flute
for the marching band.

1608
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,289
I'm not in the
fucking marching band.

1609
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,442
Oh, dude, you sure? I heard
you play the skin flute.

1610
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,404
All right, I got
a question for you guys.

1611
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,880
If you think
you're so cool,

1612
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,765
why you hanging out with a bunch
of 8th graders on a Friday night?

1613
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,569
Hey. Fuck you,
you little penis wrinkle.

1614
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,971
You're lucky
to even be here.

1615
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,400
This is our camp-out.

1616
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,130
The only reason you little
cum gums are here

1617
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,964
is because fucking
Charlie's mom made him

1618
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,769
bring his little
asshole brother

1619
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,081
and then he drags along
you little dice danglers.

1620
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,481
Fucking fuzz nut,
talking shit!

1621
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,931
It's all good, man.

1622
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,731
These little fuzz nuts are going
to get their chance soon enough.

1623
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,325
We got some whores
coming by later.

1624
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,046
- Yeah?
- Hell yeah!

1625
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,647
Now, I know Chase
will fuck anything.

1626
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,121
I mean, I've seen this kid
mount boulders before.

1627
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,521
But what about you guys?
You in?

1628
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,485
- Whatever.
- All right.

1629
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,607
Good man.
All right.

1630
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,205
What about you, Peter Puffer?

1631
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,521
I don't know. Maybe.

1632
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,807
Dude, it's okay to be gay.
We understand.

1633
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,769
Just, you know,
sleep over there.

1634
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,800
I'm not gay-

1635
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,649
Give it some time, man.
You'll realize.

1636
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,087
Fuck y'all.

1637
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,402
See, that's exactly
my point, man.

1638
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,961
Nah, but we don't have
whores coming over.

1639
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,042
We were just fucking with
you to see what you'd say.

1640
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,168
And you just earned
your vag badge.

1641
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,009
Put it next
to your bitch card.

1642
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,570
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
you're a bitch.

1643
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,530
Now hold this like
the bitch you are, bitch.

1644
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,602
All right, this shit is
called the death punch.

1645
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,488
Whoa, Jesus!

1646
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,126
Hey-

1647
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,882
You guys made it! Good.

1648
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,441
Oh.

1649
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,289
There you are.
Oh, wow.

1650
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,521
And here you go, hostess.

1651
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,246
Oh, thank you.
Can I get you a bite?

1652
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,169
Oh, that's cool.
Thanks.

1653
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,571
You did that?

1654
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,966
Yeah.
Wow.

1655
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,480
How long have you
been doing that for?

1656
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,523
Not very long. Um...

1657
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,648
I went to this camp thing
just this past summer.

1658
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,002
They have a camp
for graffiti?

1659
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,082
Well, they call it
"urban art." Oh.

1660
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,170
So it sounds, you know,
less illegal

1661
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,647
but it was really just a way
to get free spray paint.

1662
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,488
Cool. So is this your tag?

1663
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,608
Is that...
Do they still call it...

1664
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,604
Yeah, but you know, it's just
letters that I'm good at writing.

1665
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,087
It's a

1666
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,042
E.

1667
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,849
"E-Z-J-O."

1668
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,651
Kez Jo.
That's cool.

1669
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,722
It doesn't really
mean anything, though.

1670
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,806
Is that your dad?

1671
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,241
Yeah.

1672
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,441
Where's he live?

1673
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,561
In Houston.

1674
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,451
Get to see him much?

1675
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,331
Yeah. Some weekends
and over the summer.

1676
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,566
Cool.

1677
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,563
So, you're a student
of my mom's, right?

1678
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,727
Mmm-hmm.

1679
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,644
Yeah,
I got one class with her.

1680
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,085
Yeah, she's cool.

1681
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,530
How's she doing? You know, is she
a good teacher and everything?

1682
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,806
Yeah, she's great!

1683
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,327
She's super-smart
and she cares, you know.

1684
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,731
She makes it interesting.

1685
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,651
She's probably even
my favorite teacher.

1686
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,924
So, anyway, we figured
out a way to rig up our iPods

1687
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,923
to the external speakers
on the ASB.

1688
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,480
So every time
we come rolling into town,

1689
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,289
you knew
the 4-56 was there

1690
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,771
'cause we were bumping
House of Pain.

1691
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,968
It was like,
"Jump around, jump around."

1692
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,166
And the whole family's
coming outside,

1693
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,766
you got the kids and,
uh, the mom and the dad

1694
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,410
and they're all
bouncing up and down,

1695
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,921
we're throwing out
candies for the kids

1696
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,561
and soccer balls and Beanie
Babies and Frisbees, uh,

1697
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,721
smokes for the adults,

1698
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,521
and, uh, they loved, they
absolutely loved Gatorade.

1699
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,683
But for some reason, you know,
they hated the lemon-lime flavor.

1700
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,331
I don't know what it was.

1701
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,289
Yeah.
Couldn't give it away.

1702
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,486
How long were you
over there?

1703
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,567
Uh, I did two tours in Iraq
and one in Bosnia.

1704
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,727
Wow.

1705
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,167
Did you enlist?

1706
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,922
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I was, um,
Army National Guard,

1707
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,650
and, you know, coming
straight out of high school,

1708
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,171
needed money
for college.

1709
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,446
Seemed like
a decent paying job.

1710
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,851
And, uh, did my tour.

1711
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,440
And whenever I got done
I told them,

1712
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,370
if there's a world-changing
event, I'll come back.

1713
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,202
And, uh, three months later 9/11
happened, and I was back 9/12.

1714
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,402
And I'm proud to say the 4-56,
the whole time we were there,

1715
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,926
we never lost a guy,
not one casualty.

1716
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,729
But is that odd?
Is that unusual?

1717
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,810
Yeah. Uh...

1718
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,723
Almost impossible.

1719
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,128
Like, the guys that came along
after us and replaced us,

1720
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,328
they didn't listen
to any of our advice.

1721
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,006
They did, basically, the polar
opposite of what we did,

1722
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,481
and they lost seven guys
in the first month.

1723
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,721
WOW.

1724
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,765
What did you guys
do differently?

1725
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,246
I like to think it's just a matter
of mutual respect, you know.

1726
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,164
All the time we spent over
there building trust,

1727
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,846
these guys basically
destroyed it in three days.

1728
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,287
So, what did the locals think
about why we're there?

1729
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,048
- Oil, plain and simple.
- Mmm.

1730
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,530
Hey, Mason.
One last hit.

1731
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,646
Hey-

1732
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,610
Mickey Mouse Club.
Get the fuck out of my car.

1733
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,525
Just crawl out the back
window or something, man.

1734
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,602
I'm gonna miss you.

1735
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,330
I'll see you
on Sunday night.

1736
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,881
All right. You better text me.

1737
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,447
Mmm...

1738
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,522
Do you have any gum?
Um...

1739
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,563
Yeah, I do, actually.
Here you go.

1740
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,444
Thanks. See ya.

1741
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,244
And they're buying this party line
that they're supposed to feel bad

1742
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,606
and trade off
their own pension,

1743
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,284
as if that's what's been
corrupting this nation.

1744
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,124
Yeah, because
those who heart Fox,

1745
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,884
in my opinion,
are being lied to.

1746
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,610
Yeah,
thank God for Wisconsin.

1747
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,284
We have to follow
that example.

1748
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,805
You're right.

1749
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,764
Hey, Mason,
what time is it?

1750
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,281
Uh, like 12315.

1751
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,361
Happy birthday.

1752
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,000
Happy birthday!

1753
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,765
Mason.

1754
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,808
It's your birthday?

1755
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,325
Just now, I guess.

1756
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,765
Yeah, how old are you?

1757
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,330
Fifteen.

1758
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,767
Fifteen. Give me a hug.

1759
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,684
Happy birthday.
Oh, my goodness!

1760
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,370
Have you been drinking?

1761
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,607
Have you?

1762
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,248
Yeah, a little.
Have you?

1763
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,571
A little bit.

1764
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,680
Have you been...

1765
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,324
A little bit.

1766
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,200
on.

1767
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,481
Oh...

1768
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,330
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1769
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,042
Talk in the morning, huh?

1770
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,406
Hey,Dad.

1771
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,841
Hey! How you doing? Mmm... Good.

1772
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,090
Whose car is that?
That's our car.

1773
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,322
Hop on in there.
Hey.

1774
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,970
Hi, sweetie.

1775
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,721
Oh...

1776
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,646
<i>Hey, Cooper.</i>

1777
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,882
Hey! How's it going?

1778
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,885
Hello, little brother.

1779
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,601
He's so cute.

1780
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,648
Can we just replace
that part of the pipe?

1781
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,451
No, is no good.
Everything is no good.

1782
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,041
Everything. Yes, mira.

1783
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,886
This one is...

1784
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,166
Stronger.

1785
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,810
Yes. This is better,
yes,yes,yes.

1786
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,846
Hey, listen, thanks for
that camera you got Mason.

1787
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,249
Oh, yeah, Mason's all into the photography.
He's loving that thing.

1788
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,401
Yeah, I know.

1789
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,563
He's actually talking about turning
his, uh, closet into a darkroom.

1790
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,961
Like the red light and the
developing, the whole nine...

1791
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,121
You all right with that?

1792
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,368
I probably won't see him for a week.
Oh, yeah. Right.

1793
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,925
But he's having
a good time.

1794
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,407
At least he's focused on something.
Yeah. Yeah.

1795
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,084
That's what I like.
Yeah, he's all about it.

1796
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,488
Okay, let's go grande.

1797
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,643
It's good? It's better, yes.
It's good.

1798
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,324
You know, you're smart.
You should be in school.

1799
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,290
Oh, I like
school, I need school,

1800
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,520
but it's hard,
I working all day.

1801
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,690
Go to night school at community college.
It's pretty affordable.

1802
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,047
You're doing a nice job with the house.
It's looking great.

1803
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,201
Oh, thanks.
Really great.

1804
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,726
Yeah, you know, some
fix-its here and there.

1805
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,770
We got a good deal on a foreclosure,
so now I'm finding out why.

1806
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,081
Yeah, really. Hey,bud! Hey.

1807
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,089
Happy birthday, huh?
What's that?

1808
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,329
What's that? That's our new car.
Get in it.

1809
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,602
All right.
Have a good weekend.

1810
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,289
How you doing?

1811
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,448
Good to see you.
You, too.

1812
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,885
Hey!

1813
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,685
Hey, how are you?

1814
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,807
Ooh...

1815
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,089
You look great. Ooh!
 Thanks.

1816
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,443
Look at him!
Aw, he's got Mason's nose.

1817
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,010
- Yeah, isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

1818
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,804
- All right!
- Love you guys.

1819
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,120
We got a big drive ahead of us.

1820
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,566
Bye, Sam.

1821
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:05,766
You guys drive safe.

1822
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,170
All right. Well,
we'll be back tomorrow night.

1823
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,720
Bye, honey.
I'm so glad you were born!

1824
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:31,204
So, this is like Annie's car
and you drive the GTO?

1825
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,008
I guess you can't really put
a baby seat in that thing.

1826
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,244
Yeah, no. But I had
to sell that anyway.

1827
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,401
You what?

1828
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,289
Yeah, I had to sell that.

1829
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,171
So it's gone?

1830
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,607
Yeah, some sucker
collector from California

1831
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,523
paid 22 grand for it,
which is great

1832
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,046
'cause I basically got
to pay for this in cash.

1833
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,691
I only paid $8,500 for
that thing way back when.

1834
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,089
Cars are generally a terrible
investment, you know.

1835
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,366
Soon as you drive
them off the lot,

1836
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,487
you got a used car
on your hands,

1837
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,449
and the value's only
dropping from there.

1838
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,206
But if you take care
of it, you know,

1839
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,805
and you get lucky
and it's a classic,

1840
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,370
the value starts
going up again.

1841
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,125
Shit, you got guys paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars

1842
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,123
for some Shelby Cobra.

1843
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,206
What?

1844
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,645
You don't remember?

1845
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,568
Remember what?
Really?

1846
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,367
You said that was going to
be my car when I turned 16.

1847
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,451
What? No,
I didn't. I never said that.

1848
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,409
I remember.
I was in third grade

1849
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,962
and you were taking me over to Anthony
Nadar's house for his birthday,

1850
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,611
and we were there early, so we
gave him a ride around the block,

1851
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,404
and he was talking about how
much he loved your car,

1852
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,926
and so you were all like, "Oh, this is
gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."

1853
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,523
All right, first off, I have
no memory of that, all right?

1854
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,126
Second of all, I would
never say that. Never

1855
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,090
Oh, you did, though.

1856
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,366
What?

1857
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,846
Mason.

1858
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,601
Come on,
what about your sister?

1859
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,801
I'm just gonna
forget about her?

1860
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,128
Come on,
how's that fair? Huh?

1861
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,529
Anthony Nagar. What...

1862
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,850
Are you...

1863
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,331
Oh, come on!

1864
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,842
I mean, you're not...

1865
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,640
Look, you can sit there like there's
a death in the family, all right,

1866
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,563
but bottom line is, that was my car.
All right?

1867
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,847
I paid for it,
I took care of it,

1868
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,651
and I can do whatever
I want with it. All right?

1869
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,246
I'm sorry if you had other ideas
about it, but when you get older,

1870
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,368
you can save up
and buy a car of your own.

1871
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,647
Be cool like I used to be.

1872
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,167
Or you can get a minivan.

1873
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,967
Does your mom actually
let you watch this?

1874
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,122
Yeah. She likes it, too.

1875
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,245
Oh, my God.

1876
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,685
Okay, well, have you ever
seen her in concert?

1877
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,161
No, but she's coming
to Houston in April.

1878
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,969
She's coming to Houston?
Mmm-hmm.

1879
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,169
Your dad and I could get you tickets
and you could stay with us.

1880
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,083
That'd be great!
Yeah.

1881
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,606
- Hey, Annie?
- Yup.

1882
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,684
Will you get me the little
birthday present for Mason?

1883
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,841
Here, babe.
All right.

1884
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,641
This one needs
a little explanation, okay?

1885
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,561
Open it up.

1886
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,564
I call that
the Beatles Black Album.

1887
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,406
What it is, is the best of
John, Paul, George and Ringo,

1888
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,482
solo, post-breakup.

1889
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,561
Thanks.

1890
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,483
Basically, I put the band back
together for you.

1891
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,369
Whenever you listen
to too much of the solo stuff,

1892
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,010
it kind of becomes a drag,
you know?

1893
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,402
But you put them next
to each other, right,

1894
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,084
and they start
to elevate each other,

1895
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,491
and then you can hear it.

1896
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,251
It's The Beatles,
you know?

1897
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,850
I don't know. I think I always
just liked Paul the best.

1898
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,565
It doesn't matter, you know,
you're missing the point.

1899
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,728
There is no favorite Beatle!

1900
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,848
That's what I'm saying.
It's in the balance.

1901
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,048
That's what made them
the greatest fucking rock band

1902
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,282
in the world, okay?

1903
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,408
And there's this decade
of music out there

1904
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,891
that's been scattered,
all right,

1905
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:24,124
and now it has been carefully
found, arranged and ordered for you

1906
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,725
by your loving father.

1907
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,609
Very arranged
and very organized,

1908
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,001
over and over again
by your loving father.

1909
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,406
Yes, yes, yes.

1910
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,244
So, I mean,
look at that, look at that.

1911
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,482
Uh, top of volume ll,
first four tracks,

1912
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,801
<i>you've got Band on the Run
into My Sweet Lord</i>

1913
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,804
<i>into Jealous Guy
into Photograph. Come on!</i>

1914
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,524
It's like the perfect segue.

1915
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,921
You got Paul,
who takes you to the party,

1916
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,923
George who talks
to you about God,

1917
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,288
John is just, "No,
it's about love and pain,"

1918
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,362
and then Ringo
who just says,

1919
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,250
"Hey. Can't we enjoy what
we have while we have it?"

1920
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,561
It's a good record.
I shit you not.

1921
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,241
Cool.

1922
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,166
Hey, there, Cliff.
Hey, how you doing?

1923
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,605
Good. How you doing?
Hi, birthday boy!

1924
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:30,961
It's good to see you.

1925
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,883
Ah, it's great to see you. Yeah.

1926
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,447
You made it
all right, huh?

1927
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,681
Yeah, we sure did.
We sure did.

1928
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,841
How are you, darling?

1929
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,964
Let's just get this one...
All right, we ready?

1930
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,087
Yeah.

1931
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,281
Wait.

1932
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,884
Hey, Sam.

1933
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,803
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.

1934
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,481
Hey, still sleeping here?

1935
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,686
Oh, yeah.

1936
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,000
Hey, buddy.

1937
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,401
Oh!

1938
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,522
Make a wish,
make a wish.

1939
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,645
Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait.
Here, sweetie.

1940
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,609
Sam, would you get us
a knife so we can cut this up?

1941
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,161
All right.

1942
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:30,286
I hope you like it. I
heard you didn't have one, so.

1943
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,687
It's a Bible. This is your first Bible.

1944
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,202
Look,
there's your name.

1945
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,850
Wow. In gold. And
wait, wait, wait.

1946
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,490
Look at this.

1947
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,686
It's a red-letter edition,

1948
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,889
and that means that everything
that Jesus said is in red.

1949
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,483
Thank you. You like it?
All right.

1950
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,369
I love you, sweetie.
Happy birthday.

1951
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,846
And this
one's from us.

1952
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,570
Oh, yeah, here.

1953
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,803
It's not going to make all
your dreams come true here.

1954
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,291
Just keep
your expectations low.

1955
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,486
No, you need it.
It's...

1956
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,690
Come on, right? You gotta have it.
You need this.

1957
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,205
You got life ahead of you.

1958
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,725
And the shirt is blue.

1959
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,882
You got dances
and job interviews.

1960
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,610
Here, I'm going to get
it all wrinkled here.

1961
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,043
Mason? Come here, son.
Uh-oh.

1962
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,961
<i>SIGHING)</i>

1963
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,322
Pull that Off.

1964
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,207
There's a 20-gauge shotgun.
Wow.

1965
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,409
My dad gave it to me when I was
a little younger than you,

1966
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,608
and his dad gave it to him.

1967
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:36,481
Well, you're 15 and I'd like
for you to have it, all right?

1968
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,882
Here, you hold it.

1969
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,920
Yeah?

1970
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,611
Thank you.
Congratulations, son.

1971
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,170
I'll teach you
how to clean it,

1972
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,083
teach you how to fire it.

1973
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,641
I'll teach
you a little bit of safety.

1974
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,087
Now cock it.
All right, there you go.

1975
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,606
Now, what you want to do is line up
the front sight with the back sight.

1976
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,091
Here, you see this little V right here?
Mmm-hmm.

1977
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,281
Now which one
you aiming at?

1978
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,361
Uh, the middle can.

1979
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,885
The middle can? All right.
Mmm-hmm.

1980
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,206
Now fire at will,
all right?

1981
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,805
Ho! Whoa!
Yeah!

1982
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,729
All right, watch out, watch out.
Whoa. Be careful. All right.

1983
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,361
Ready?

1984
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,361
Pull!

1985
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,363
Oh, you hit a little low.

1986
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,244
Wait till it gets up high,
then shoot, all right?

1987
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,290
'Cause then it's a better
aim coming down.

1988
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,729
Remember, second trigger.

1989
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:27,801
Mmm-hmm.

1990
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,484
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

1991
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,166
Pull!

1992
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,084
Look what you did! Well,
you nailed it, didn't you?

1993
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,923
How did that feel?
Felt good.

1994
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,604
Yeah, it felt good. Good.

1995
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,885
<i>Well, I want for
us to be together forever</i>

1996
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,083
<i>But to wander

1997
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,004
<i>I want you to be
easy and casual</i>

1998
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,527
<i>But still demand I stay</i>

1999
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,285
<i>I want for you
to know me completely</i>

2000
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,368
<i>But still remain
mysterious</i>

2001
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,168
<i>Consider
everything deeply</i>

2002
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,720
<i>But still remain fearless</i>

2003
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,724
<i>Climb to the top

<i>Dance barefoot

<i>Reach for the stars

01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,209
<i>If I don't try,

<i>'Cause arrivals and departures

2015
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,281
Oh!

2016
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,126
You're our first
audience, you know?

2017
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,042
Mason demanded we work
on it the whole time.

2018
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,406
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

2019
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,970
It's a work in progress.

2020
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,566
A week later,
we don't know why

2021
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,847
Thomas wasn't there
the first time, uh,

2022
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:06,891
but a week later,
Thomas comes back

2023
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,405
and joins
the other disciples.

2024
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,608
They say, "The Lord's
alive, we saw him!"

2025
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,401
"I won't believe it until I
put my finger into his side,

2026
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,404
"and I wanna see those
nail prints in his hands."

2027
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,448
About
that time, here comes Jesus

2028
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,841
standing right
next to him, okay?

2029
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,447
And he turns to Thomas. Don't you
know, Thomas felt some shame.

2030
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,682
He turns to Thomas
and says,

2031
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,491
"Thomas, here, stick
your finger in my side.

2032
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,483
"Look at these nail prints.
It's me."

2033
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:37,000
And Thomas says, "My Lord
and my God, I believe."

2034
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,001
And Jesus said,
"Well, that's good,

2035
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,804
"but blessed are those who
can believe without seeing."

2036
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,922
It's a lot easier when you
can see and feel and touch,

2037
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:53,408
but like us, we haven't
seen him in the flesh,

2038
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,365
we haven't felt him
in the flesh,

2039
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,761
but we have experienced
him in the spirit.

2040
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:00,360
At least, I have,
and I hope y'all have, too.

2041
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,202
The pond's right up here.

2042
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,850
Ooh, it's low.

2043
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,206
Yeah.

2044
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,280
You know, my dad could
take you fishing

2045
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,600
next time you're here
if you want.

2046
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,886
Thanks.

2047
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:20,729
Hi, baby.
What's goin' on?

2048
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,845
No, I think we're just gonna
hang here for a minute.

2049
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,365
You want me
to stay with you?

2050
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,805
No, it's okay.
You sure?

2051
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:27,881
Yeah. Thanks.

2052
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:36,610
Mason, why are you
such a stick-in-the-mud?

2053
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,164
What are you
even talking about?

2054
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,004
You guys don't mind coming
back here on the 20th, do you,

2055
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,161
for Cooper's baptism?

2056
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,368
No, that's fine.
Sam?

2057
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,965
I appreciate it.

2058
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,884
It means a lot to Annie
and her folks, you know.

2059
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,444
Were we baptized?

2060
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,407
I wasn't the least bit concerned
with the state of your soul.

2061
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,370
We can do it now,
though, if you want.

2062
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,487
No, I think
I'm all right.

2063
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,449
You and Cooper together,
you know.

2064
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,090
Dunk your heads.

2065
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,245
You're not becoming one of those
God people, are you, Dad?

2066
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,084
And what's that
supposed to mean, huh?

2067
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,049
I can hear you!

2068
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,001
Oh, wow.

2069
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,321
I think that shotgun should
live at my house, huh?

2070
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,681
I don't think your mom would love that.

2071
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,406
Look out, Sam.

2072
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,403
Let me show you
how it's done.

2073
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,131
Nice, Dad.

2074
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,689
Still got the goods, hmm?

2075
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,886
How long you been
in here, Mason?

2076
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,041
I'm not sure.

2077
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,924
I'm sure.

2078
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,525
All class.

2079
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,685
Did you complete
your image diary?

2080
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,001
Not yet.

2081
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,086
Completed your, uh,
digital contact sheet?

2082
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,084
Not quite, but it's
not gonna take me long.

2083
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,847
Not yet. Not quite.

2084
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,447
Dark room time
is extra-curricular.

2085
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,084
I mean, technically, you don't ever
have to be in here these days,

2086
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,686
and certainly not until you've
completed your assignments.

2087
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,807
That's the deal.

2088
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:18,326
Sorry.

2089
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,444
I'm worried about
you, Mason.

2090
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,081
Why is that?

2091
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,286
I'll tell you why.

2092
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,842
The images you're turning
in, they're cool.

2093
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,404
You're looking at things
in a really unique way.

2094
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,209
Got a lot of natural talent.

2095
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,086
Thanks.

2096
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,128
Yeah, but that
and 50 cents

2097
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,044
will just get you a cup of
coffee in this old world.

2098
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,888
I've met a lot of talented
people over the years.

2099
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:47,887
How many of them
made it professionally

2100
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,201
without discipline,
commitment

2101
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,521
and a really good
work ethic?

2102
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,689
I can tell you. I can
count it on two fingers.

2103
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,647
Zero.

2104
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,889
It's not gonna happen
for you, Mason.

2105
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,689
The world is too competitive.

2106
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:06,128
There are too many talented people
who are willing to work hard,

2107
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,124
and a butt load of morons
who are untalented

2108
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,083
who are more than
willing to surpass you.

2109
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,202
As a matter of fact, a lot of them
are sitting in that classroom

2110
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,645
out there right now, hmm?

2111
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,767
You know what they're doing?

2112
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,444
They're doing
their assignments.

2113
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,488
Which is what you're supposed
to be doing, but you're not.

2114
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,686
You're in here.

2115
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,091
Now why is that?

2116
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,249
You special, Mason?

2117
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,368
No, but the things
you're talking about,

2118
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,204
like work ethic
or whatever,

2119
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,930
I feel like I do
work pretty hard.

2120
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,969
I spend the whole weekend
taking pictures a lot of times.

2121
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,962
You like football, Mason?

2122
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,364
Not really.

2123
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,527
Yeah, I know you don't.

2124
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,602
That's why
I've just assigned you

2125
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,684
to shoot the football
game tonight. Okay?

2126
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,922
It starts at 7:30, I want
you to get there early,

2127
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,004
I want you to shoot a full card, 300
images, I want them downloaded,

2128
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,607
I want them sorted, and I want to
see them very first thing Monday.

2129
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,525
You want to know
why I'm doing this?

2130
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,801
I guess.

2131
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,609
Who do you want
to be, Mason?

2132
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,530
What do you want to do?

2133
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,524
I want to take pictures.
 Make art.

2134
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,448
Any dipshit can
take pictures, Mason.

2135
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,766
Art, that's special.

2136
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,327
What can you bring to it
that nobody else can?

2137
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,404
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

2138
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,609
Try harder.

2139
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:27,571
Maybe in 20 years you can call old
Mr. Turlington and you can say,

2140
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,404
"Thank you, sir,

2141
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,290
"for that terrific darkroom
chat we had that day."

2142
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,280
Get back to class
and do your work.

2143
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,684
Hey, man, you're walkin'
a little funny.

2144
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,404
Fuck you.

2145
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,485
I'm just saying, you guys were
in there for a long time.

2146
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,011
Just hope he bought
you dinner first.

2147
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,365
Mason! Honey,
come down for dinner.

2148
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,483
Samantha! You didn't post these
pictures and their descriptions?

2149
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,722
Come on. This auction is
gonna end on Sunday, honey.

2150
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,768
You've gotta get
those posted.

2151
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,689
Why are we even doing this?

2152
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,569
It's like an online
junk shop.

2153
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:34,880
I thought you had
a good job.

2154
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,406
I do. We're what
you call house poor.

2155
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,361
Everyone's got
to do their part.

2156
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,521
Your brother took
the pictures.

2157
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,605
You have to help.

2158
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,966
Who even buys this shit?

2159
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,486
Hey. Sam, watch your mouth,
all right?

2160
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,130
Don't disrespect
your mother.

2161
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,725
You like a roof over
your head, don't you?

2162
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,605
Yeah, and you like
having electricity

2163
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,091
so that you can charge
your cell phone?

2164
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,641
I'm not even gonna
be here next year.

2165
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,725
I'm a senior.
I should be having fun.

2166
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,401
Nice nails.

2167
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,251
Yeah, some girl did
that in sixth period.

2168
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,801
You planning
on keeping them?

2169
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:30,042
Until it comes off,
l guess.

2170
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:36,205
Last summer it was the
earrings, and now the nails.

2171
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,244
You got a purse
to go with all that?

2172
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,608
A lot of guys do that.
He's just trying to be cool.

2173
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,003
When I was in high school,
having a job,

2174
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,764
being responsible, being able
to afford a car, that was cool.

2175
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,761
Mason, honey,

2176
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,611
why don't you get you and
your sister some water.

2177
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,931
Hey, man, Turlington says to cut
the artsy crap and shoot the game.

2178
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,241
So take your lens
and point it that way.

2179
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,321
Jesus Christ.

2180
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,607
Also, we got a ride.

2181
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,125
McCormick's gonna
take us to the party.

2182
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,929
We're gonna head out
after the game.

2183
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,081
You're goin', okay?

2184
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,161
Okay-

2185
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,890
Shoot the game.

2186
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:24,929
First one! What was that?
What was that? What is up?

2187
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,804
Hey, what's up?
Hey.

2188
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,041
How's it goin'?

2189
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,451
Pretty good.

2190
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,010
How long have
you been here?

2191
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,965
I don't know.
Awhile, I guess.

2192
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,371
Awhile?

2193
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:57,483
I just feel like there are so
many things that I could be doing

2194
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,325
and probably want to be
doing that I'm just not.

2195
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,447
Why aren't you?

2196
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,485
I mean, I guess it's just being
afraid of what people would think.

2197
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,369
You know, judgment.
Yeah.

2198
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,449
I guess it's really easy
to say like,

2199
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,090
"I don't care
what anyone else thinks,"

2200
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,328
but everyone does, you know?
Exactly.

2201
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,765
Deep down.

2202
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,846
I find myself so furious at all these
people that I'm in contact with

2203
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,526
just for controlling me
or whatever,

2204
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,763
but, you know, they're not
even aware they're doing it.

2205
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,611
Yeah.

2206
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:33,085
So, in this perfect world, where
no one's controlling you,

2207
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,561
what's different?
What changes?

2208
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,567
Everything.

2209
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,723
I mean, I just wanna be
able to do anything I want,

2210
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,291
because it makes me
feel alive.

2211
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,402
As opposed to giving me
the appearance of normality.

2212
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,843
Whatever that means.

2213
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,086
I don't think
it means much.

2214
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,287
You're kinda weird, you know that?

2215
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,807
Yeah?

2216
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,041
Is that a compliment?

2217
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:04,090
I don't know.
Do you wanna be weird?

2218
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,845
I mean, I don't want to like scare kids
at the park, or anything like that.

2219
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,166
I really like
talking with you.

2220
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,884
I don't usually even try
to vocalize my thoughts

2221
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,371
or feelings
or anything.

2222
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,363
I don't know, it never sounds right.
Words are stupid.

2223
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,601
So, why are you
trying with me?

2224
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,327
I don't know.
I guess I feel comfortable.

2225
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:31,210
I'm glad.

2226
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,084
Hey, Jim.

2227
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,366
I'm sorry I'm so late.

2228
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,607
What time are you
supposed to be home?

2229
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,842
I don't know.
A while ago.

2230
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,526
While ago like, 30 minutes
ago, an hour ago?

2231
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,482
'Cause truthfully
nobody even knew

2232
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,164
where you were
until your sister told us.

2233
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:55,924
She's been home
for a while.

2234
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,531
I'm sorry.

2235
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,970
Yeah, been hearin'
a lot of that lately.

2236
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:06,244
See,but you
don't actually care.

2237
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:10,166
You just kinda come
and go as you please,

2238
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,763
and you don't care
if your mom's upset,

2239
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,127
or what time
you gotta be home.

2240
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,930
Is that what's up?

2241
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,206
I don't know
what to tell you.

2242
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,964
Stop mumbling!

2243
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,804
You know, speak up!

2244
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,442
I can't understand a word
comin' out of your mouth.

2245
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,488
It's just like...

2246
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,483
And I ask you questions
and you just...

2247
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,131
Can I just have one day where
everyone isn't all over my ass?

2248
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,883
I'm up your ass?

2249
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,648
This is my house.
All right?

2250
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,484
If you wanna live
in my house,

2251
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,881
then you get home when you
say you're gonna be home.

2252
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,450
You know, Jim,
you're not my dad.

2253
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,244
No, I'm not your dad.

2254
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,449
You know how I know that?
'Cause I'm actually here.

2255
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,767
I'm the guy with the job,
payin' the bills,

2256
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:57,766
takin' care of you, your
mom, your sister, huh? Huh?

2257
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,570
I'm that guy!

2258
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,084
Morning.
Morning.

2259
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:30,206
Hey. Which one of you guys used the
downstairs bathroom last night?

2260
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,127
I don't know.
I didn't.

2261
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,964
That tall guy,
what's his name?

2262
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,640
Phillip?

2263
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:41,202
Yeah, Phillip. He did it.
Can Phillip read?

2264
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,327
You know, there's
a big sign on the door.

2265
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,050
It says, "Do not use this
bathroom, it's broken."

2266
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,282
I mean,
how difficult is that?

2267
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:49,128
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

2268
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:55,964
I think I'm gonna put the
house on the market.

2269
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,686
Why?

2270
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,250
This house is too big for us.

2271
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,890
You're going to
school eventually.

2272
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,008
It's too expensive.
I'm done.

2273
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,609
Why did you even buy it
in the first place then?

2274
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:11,247
Because I really enjoy
making poor life decisions,

2275
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,800
keeping us on
the brink of poverty.

2276
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:18,128
I've spent the first half of my
life acquiring all this crap,

2277
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,929
and now I'm gonna spend
the second half of my life

2278
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,604
getting rid
of all this stuff.

2279
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,887
Really? Like what?

2280
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,611
Well, I got rid of
a couple husbands,

2281
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:28,011
now I'm gonna get rid
of a mortgage,

2282
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:31,402
some maintenance,
the tchotchskes,

2283
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,246
the homeowner's insurance, the
property tax, the plumbing.

2284
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,491
You know what?
From now on,

2285
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:41,528
lam gonna be Mommy Monk.

2286
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,202
Simple. Celibate.

2287
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,209
Don't be gross, Mom.

2288
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,686
Fine.

2289
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,282
I'll be a poor whore
with a big house.

2290
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,811
Is that better? Hmm?

2291
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,085
Okay.

2292
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:05,646
Mason, please, don't leave
me that dirty dish to wash.

2293
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,206
I do dishes all day.

2294
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:11,121
Oh, great! Honey,
then you're a professional.

2295
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,170
Come on, you could do one or two
more for your poor old mom.

2296
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:15,401
Okay-

2297
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,843
Thank you.

2298
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,885
You want one?

2299
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,240
on, God!

2300
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,481
She didn't even
touch them, seriously.

2301
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:45,965
I watched her
the whole time.

2302
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:48,925
I bet you did watch her,
you little pervert.

2303
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,966
It's like
we're on a date.

2304
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,769
Cheers.

2305
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,444
It's a night of romance.

2306
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,082
Yeah, except
I'm not gonna kiss you.

2307
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,802
I will blow you, though.

2308
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,691
Mason! We are in
the weeds out here!

2309
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,125
I'm goin' as fast
as I can.

2310
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,408
Oh, then I must be
confused then,

2311
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,244
'cause I just saw you
chattin' it up with April,

2312
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,049
when I got a salad bar
that needs a refill,

2313
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,600
I got a six-top,
two four-tops I can't use

2314
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:26,966
because they
haven't been bussed!

2315
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,368
Enrique is not here.
I'm tryin'.

2316
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:32,201
Well, while you're tryin',
we're dyin'!

2317
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,089
What am I supposed
to tell my customers?

2318
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:37,050
"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's
got dirty plates on it,

2319
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,645
"but Mason's trying.

2320
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,765
"At least that's
what he told me.

2321
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,650
"After he was flirtin' with April
and eatin' your leftover shrimp."

2322
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,881
Now it is a challenge
out there today, I know,

2323
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,529
but I wanna share
something with you.

2324
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,209
I got you pegged
for fry cook this summer,

2325
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,123
and that's a lot
more responsibility.

2326
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:57,444
It's also more money.
How's that sound?

2327
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:59,527
Good.

2328
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,249
I know you can
handle that money,

2329
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,721
but can you take
the responsibility?

2330
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,685
I think you can,
because I believe in you.

2331
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,841
But I need you on the floor.

2332
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,083
Now leave the dishes.
Giddy up.

2333
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,167
All right, come on!
Don't let me down!

2334
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,563
<i>Well, so it's runnin' okay? That
alternator's not messin' up anymore?</i>

2335
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,003
No, it's fine.
It's up for the trip.

2336
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,840
Good.

2337
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:29,446
<i>Are you gonna see your sister
when you guys are in Austin?</i>

2338
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,761
Yeah, she said I can stay
at her dorm, which is cool.

2339
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,207
And I guess her roommate's out
of town, so it's no big deal.

2340
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:36,645
<i>All right.
Did you apply there yet?</i>

2341
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,324
<i>Did you get that
application in to UT?</i>

2342
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,165
Not yet, but Sheena's
pretty much in, though.

2343
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,242
<i>Right. Well, if you know
that's where you wanna go,</i>

2344
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:46,005
<i>you should probably do that early
acceptance thing, you know?</i>

2345
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,526
<i>Seriously, let 'em know you're
a man who knows what he wants.</i>

2346
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,647
Yeah.

2347
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:53,042
<i>A little bit of decisiveness goes a
long way in this life, all right?</i>

2348
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:54,566
Yeah.
Great.

2349
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:56,529
<i>And what about work?
How's that goin'?</i>

2350
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:59,205
Uh, I don't know.
It's all right.

2351
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,169
Today kind of sucked.
This guy didn't show up.

2352
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,965
But it's definitely an interesting
perspective on the world.

2353
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:06,890
People are slobs.

2354
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,921
<i>Well, when people ask me
about you, I say to them,</i>

2355
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,331
<i>"Mason, he's doing great.</i>

2356
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,370
<i>"He's got a job,
he's really cleanin' up."</i>

2357
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,363
<i>AH right, say hi to Annie
and Cooper, will you?</i>

2358
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,327
<i>Say hi to your big brother.
"Hey, big brother."</i>

2359
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,368
Hey, Annie.
Hey, kiddo.

2360
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,646
<i>Can you say bye-bye?</i>

2361
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,444
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

2362
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,410
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

2363
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,481
<i>All right. Well, be careful
when you're driving, all right?</i>

2364
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,047
<i>Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that.
All right, just...</i>

2365
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:40,603
<i>You're Obi-Wan. You're
centered, patient. Right?</i>

2366
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:42,842
<i>You watch three cars ahead,
two behind.</i>

2367
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,366
<i>Takes two bad drivers
to have an accident, okay?</i>

2368
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,441
Okay-

2369
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,361
<i>Listen, tell your sister to pick up her
phone or call me back or something.</i>

2370
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,885
<i>Okay.
All right, buddy.</i>

2371
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,122
You have a <i>good</i> one.
Bye,Dad.

2372
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,363
Hey, honey, take this
to your sister.

2373
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,930
Throw it in the truck, okay?

2374
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,764
Okay, I will.

2375
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:03,851
So where
is Sheena staying?

2376
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,326
At her friend Emily's.

2377
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,331
Is Emily a real person?

2378
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,686
Yeah.

2379
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,764
Yeah, she's a sophomore.
She has an apartment.

2380
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,963
Okay, this is in case
of emergency.

2381
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,724
Don't spend it,
I want it back.

2382
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,643
Okay. Thanks.

2383
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,400
Did you do
your homework?

2384
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,887
Most of it, but I can
finish tomorrow night.

2385
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,525
Honey, 11th grade is really important
for college. Don't blow it.

2386
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:32,047
I know, I know. I mean, we're
going to UT and everything.

2387
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,491
Oh, don't you want
me to come?

2388
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,609
"Come on, Sheena, road trip
with Mom!" I'll pay for gas.

2389
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:37,806
Fine.

2390
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,608
Just kidding. I have work.

2391
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,326
Call me when
you get there.

2392
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,606
I will.

2393
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,250
Have fun!

2394
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,529
That sounds to
me like just another

2395
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,967
extreme Mason
view of everything.

2396
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,487
Not at all!
I finally figured it out.

2397
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,404
It's like when they realized
it was gonna be too expensive

2398
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:11,371
to actually build
cyborgs and robots.

2399
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,610
I mean, the costs
of that were impossible.

2400
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,444
They decided to
just let humans

2401
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,602
turn themselves
into robots.

2402
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,284
That's what's
going on right now.

2403
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,486
Oh, right now?

2404
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,561
Yeah! I mean, why not?

2405
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:26,043
They're billions of us just laying
around, not really doing anything.

2406
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,771
We don't cost anything.

2407
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:33,528
We're even pretty good at self-maintenance
and reproducing constantly.

2408
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:38,842
And as it turns out, we're
already biologically programmed

2409
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,729
for our little
cyborg upgrades.

2410
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,450
How?
Seriously.

2411
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,966
I read this thing
the other day about how...

2412
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,771
When you hear
that ding on your inbox,

2413
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,571
you get like a dopamine
rush in your brain.

2414
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,324
It's like we're being
chemically rewarded

2415
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,926
for allowing ourselves
to be brainwashed.

2416
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:58,808
How evil is that?
We're fucked.

2417
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,010
So you deleting your Facebook
page is gonna change all that?

2418
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,324
Remember when Trevor deleted
his Facebook page last year

2419
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,289
and everyone just hated him?

2420
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,691
You made more fun
of him than anyone.

2421
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,609
I still make fun
of Trevor though.

2422
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,403
It was like he was so pathetically
desperate for attention.

2423
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,130
Or to be different,
or something.

2424
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:21,602
That's just 'cause they did that lame
story about it in the school paper.

2425
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,604
And then he had to make
a big announcement about it

2426
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:25,250
when he came back
a month later.

2427
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,448
That's the thing, though, I'm
not doing it for attention.

2428
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,842
I just wanna try and not live
my life through a screen.

2429
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:34,845
I want some kind of
actual interaction.

2430
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:38,481
A real person, not just
the profile they put up.

2431
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,248
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you saying something?

2432
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,090
Yeah, okay,
I know you're joking.

2433
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,321
But, I mean,
it's kind of true.

2434
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,370
You have been, you know, checking
your phone this whole time,

2435
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,851
so, what're you
really doing?

2436
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:52,203
You don't care what your friends
are up to on a Saturday afternoon,

2437
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:57,923
but you're also obviously not fully
experiencing my profound bitching.

2438
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,528
So, yeah, it's like everyone's just
stuck in like an in-between state.

2439
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,762
Not really
experiencing anything.

2440
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,081
It's not an experience,
it's just information.

2441
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,042
Look. For example,

2442
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:12,600
I just got the address of the club
where we're meeting them later,

2443
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,122
so we won't be wandering the streets
of Austin lost for an hour tonight.

2444
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:18,242
Thank you
very much, Facebook.

2445
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,004
And then I just texted
my mom back.

2446
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,521
Oh, that's groundbreaking.

2447
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:25,171
She hasn't seen you in,
like, 55 minutes?

2448
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:27,961
Oh...

2449
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,367
Oh, my God,
most importantly,

2450
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,364
Meg's family just got
a miniature pet pig.

2451
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:41,484
Okay, you're right. That is
a really cute, tiny pig.

2452
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,364
Our lives can go on.

2453
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,885
I want one.

2454
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,723
Nice shot.

2455
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,280
Yeah, just give the
lady at the front y'all's IDs

2456
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,408
and,uh,
she should let you in.

2457
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:00,121
It's Room 206, right?
Awesome. Mmm.

2458
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,922
It's not weird that
we're staying there, is it?

2459
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,764
No, it's fine. Have fun.

2460
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:06,205
Thank you.

2461
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,403
How long have you
guys been dating?

2462
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,249
About three months.

2463
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:14,647
Yeah, we met at a party
and it's been chill.

2464
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,128
Yeah, he seems cool.
Yeah, he is.

2465
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:19,882
- Does he go to UT, too?
- Yeah.

2466
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,406
What does he study?

2467
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:26,930
He's studying history and Italian,
I think, his minor, yeah.

2468
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,968
Does he wanna
teach Italian?

2469
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,203
I think he's still
figuring stuff out.

2470
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,406
Yeah.
He'll figure it out.

2471
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,086
He's smart.
Smart, yeah.

2472
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,362
So, where are you thinking about
living when you come here?

2473
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,204
Um, I'm not really sure yet.

2474
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:42,170
We're gonna look
at apartments tomorrow.

2475
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:43,401
Um...

2476
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,729
But I know my parents sort of were
expecting me to live in a dorm.

2477
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,242
But I'm paying
my way through college,

2478
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:51,641
so it doesn't
really matter that much.

2479
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,644
You don't have to listen to
your parents after you turn 18.

2480
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:57,644
Especially if they're not
helping you financially.

2481
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,603
That's what I figured.

2482
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:02,200
But living in a dorm isn't so bad.
Yeah?

2483
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,009
I mean, especially
if it's a coed dorm.

2484
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,081
Yeah.

2485
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:09,370
I mean, I've never been around
so many cute guys at once.

2486
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:11,921
Like, college is really fun.

2487
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,762
I'm excited.
It's great, yeah.

2488
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,481
Oh.

2489
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:32,047
The last death at the Hoover
Dam construction site

2490
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:35,408
was his son,
Patrick Tierney,

2491
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:40,042
who died on
December 20th, 1935,

2492
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,522
exactly 13 years to the day.

2493
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,161
See those
sorority girls over there?

2494
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,004
I've just decided,

2495
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,521
if you delete your Facebook
page, I'm pledging.

2496
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:56,566
Yeah, in just
a few years that's you,

2497
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,570
and that's gonna be me.

2498
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,406
...Inlaid into the terrazzo
floors was a star map,

2499
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:07,242
a celestial map of heavenly
bodies so accurately displayed

2500
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:10,449
that one could chart the
procession of the pole star

2501
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,121
14,000 years into the future, such
that future generations upon...

2502
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,611
I wonder
what his deal is.

2503
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,967
I mean, he obviously
has money to eat here.

2504
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:22,450
He just said. He's a UT
professor, tenure and everything.

2505
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,528
Look at all these people.

2506
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,001
What're they even doing here
at 3:00 in the morning?

2507
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:31,811
What are we even doing here
at 3:00 in the morning?

2508
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,570
We know what
we're doing here.

2509
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:35,842
Queso. We have a purpose.

2510
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:39,807
Hell, yeah.

2511
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,288
You know, by next summer,
this'll just be our lives.

2512
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,846
Mmm.

2513
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:50,811
Staying out all night, going
to shows, whatever we want.

2514
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,170
We ever gonna go to class?

2515
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,687
Sometimes.

2516
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,964
When it feels right.
When the inspiration hits.

2517
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,685
Only then.

2518
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,401
Anything else?

2519
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,801
<i>Uh, more queso?
Yeah.</i>

2520
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,450
Jesus.

2521
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,451
What?

2522
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,126
I don't know, doesn't it all
seem a little overwhelming?

2523
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,123
I mean, college?

2524
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:25,523
I mean, I like the idea
of being away from home

2525
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:27,967
and gaining skills and getting
better at photography.

2526
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:29,326
I just...

2527
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,731
I don't know,
I'm not counting on it

2528
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:33,883
being some big,
transformative experience.

2529
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,962
I don't think
it's that transformative.

2530
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,008
I just see it
as the next step.

2531
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:39,730
But it's like
a preordained slot

2532
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,963
that's already got
your name and number on it.

2533
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,602
I don't think
it's the key to my future.

2534
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:47,531
'Cause, I mean,
look at my mom.

2535
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:50,809
She got her degree
and got a pretty good job.

2536
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,406
She can pay her bills.

2537
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,244
I like your mom.

2538
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,086
I like my mom, too.
I just mean...

2539
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,484
Basically she's still just
as fuckin' confused as I am.

2540
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,286
Thank you.
Thanks.

2541
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:17,048
- Hello?
- Hey.

2542
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,447
Um...

2543
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:21,842
Did Sam tell you
we were gonna stay here?

2544
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,643
No.

2545
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:25,926
Sorry. Um...

2546
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:30,808
She said you were out of
town for the weekend.

2547
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,486
Yeah, I was.
I just got back.

2548
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,888
Are you her brother?

2549
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,806
Yeah, I'm Mason.

2550
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,405
Um, this is Sheena.

2551
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:44,606
Hello. Uh, great.

2552
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:48,924
All right. I'm gonna leave
my stuff here, if it's okay,

2553
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,729
and get something to eat.

2554
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:53,161
I'll just come back
in a little bit?

2555
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:56,489
Yeah, yeah, we have to
get out of here soon anyway.

2556
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,684
All right.
It's nice meeting you.

2557
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,967
- Yeah. You, too.
- Sorry!

2558
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:11,327
- That was so awkward.
Mmm-hmm.

2559
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,807
Mason,
silver-medal winner.

2560
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,401
Congratulations!

2561
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,527
Thank you.

2562
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:42,802
Heard you got a scholarship.
Yeah.

2563
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,564
Yeah, every little
bit helps, you know.

2564
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:45,971
Yeah. When you gonna
go out there?

2565
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:47,769
End of the summer, I think.

2566
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,765
Work some more before then, try
to save up some money, at least.

2567
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:54,487
Yeah, before you have to
fend for yourself. Yeah.

2568
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,411
Yeah, that's the idea.

2569
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:58,091
Well, how are you
feeling about it?

2570
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:00,010
Excited, you know.

2571
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:02,327
But kind of half-excited,
half-terrified.

2572
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,369
Yeah, kind of that
voluptuous panic.

2573
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:06,010
Yeah. Exactly.

2574
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,811
Well, it's gonna be good.
It's gonna be crazy good.

2575
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,406
I liked college a lot
better than high school.

2576
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:13,562
You kinda find your people
in college, you know?

2577
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,966
Exactly.

2578
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:16,166
You'll be fine.

2579
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,647
You got a good heart, just
follow your heart. Yeah?

2580
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,290
Thanks.
Good luck.

2581
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:22,010
Don't forget to floss.

2582
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,248
I just don't get why you're
being so fucking childish.

2583
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,084
I'm not being childish!

2584
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,527
You're the one who made it into
this big thing by telling everyone!

2585
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:42,766
I haven't told anyone.

2586
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,490
So Cynthia just
magically knows

2587
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:46,045
you're going to the prom
with this loser,

2588
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,610
even though you're not
dating him anymore?

2589
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,966
She's my best friend.

2590
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,805
Well, your best friend
has a big fucking mouth.

2591
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:53,445
Take it up with her, then.

2592
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,682
Why don't you just
tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw

2593
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:57,285
she can keep on talking,

2594
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:58,925
as long as she
includes the truth,

2595
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,241
which is that we wouldn't
be having this conversation

2596
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:04,529
if your college boyfriend weren't
out of town this weekend.

2597
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:07,090
You had already
bought the tickets.

2598
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:09,450
It's just prom,
it's not like it matters.

2599
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,045
I'm just trying to
be friends with you.

2600
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:14,363
It's just humiliating.
I can't do that.

2601
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:17,801
Mister I-Don't-Care-
What-Anyone-Else- Thinks-Of-Me.

2602
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:18,961
Fuck anyone else!

2603
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:23,364
I care what I think of me,
which isn't much right now.

2604
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:25,768
King of the Pity Prom.

2605
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:28,565
Fine. We're not going.

2606
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,605
Great.

2607
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,484
Why are we even...

2608
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,322
I mean, we both knew
this was coming.

2609
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,528
I'm just the one
who did something about it.

2610
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:51,090
Yeah, fucking
some college guy.

2611
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,446
Oh, fuck you!

2612
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:55,121
I don't regret anything.

2613
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,964
Of course you don't.

2614
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,008
You know, it's actually
kind of a relief

2615
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:01,560
not to have to be around someone
who's so gloomy all the time.

2616
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:03,726
The world's not so horrible.

2617
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:06,770
Not everything's some big
conspiracy against humanity.

2618
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:08,444
It's great that
you can think that way.

2619
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:13,282
You know, I'm sure dating a jock
really helps to clear the mind.

2620
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:17,527
He's not a jock, okay? He just
happens to be on the lacrosse team.

2621
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:20,363
We're all going to other
schools next year anyway.

2622
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,681
It's not some
super-serious relationship.

2623
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,922
Oh, great. I feel
so much better now.

2624
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:27,165
We're just having fun.

2625
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:29,006
I bet he's having fun.

2626
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:30,486
Grow up, Mason.

2627
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,764
It's not like I haven't
been with anyone else.

2628
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,766
Who?

2629
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:39,487
What do you care?

2630
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,367
Who?

2631
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,161
Does it matter?

2632
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,091
You're the one
who brought it up.

2633
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:54,089
This is pointless.

2634
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,845
Now you're just trying
to be an asshole.

2635
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,926
Holy crap, I would rather
have my balls clawed off

2636
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,241
than ever sit through
anything like that ever again.

2637
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:10,811
Well, you never,
ever have to.

2638
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,769
Oh, my God, thank you.

2639
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,842
Give me that.
Dude, it's all you.

2640
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,730
Drink up.

2641
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:20,685
So you coming out
with me tonight, brother?

2642
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,290
Should be some pretty
awesome stuff happening.

2643
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:25,728
Naw, dude, I'm going to this
show with my dad in Austin.

2644
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,450
His friend's playing.

2645
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,768
Have fun with that, I guess.

2646
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:36,331
Fuck, there are so many cars here.
I don't wanna go in there!

2647
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,201
Dude, you will have
so much fun.

2648
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:42,807
Your family loves you!
Have a swell time.

2649
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,247
Fuck you.
You're coming in with me.

2650
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,482
Oh, no. Shit, no.
Yes.

2651
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:49,722
Yes, you are. My mom loves you.
You have to say hi.

2652
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:53,882
Do you want to hurt her feelings?
Mmm-mmm.

2653
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:56,208
Well, then,
let's go get 'em!

2654
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:59,803
Just for a second. Just a
second, seriously.

2655
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:03,484
You know, you're in sort
of enemy territory here.

2656
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:04,561
We're aware.

2657
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,203
Look who's here!

2658
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,566
Hey!

2659
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,365
Get a job!

2660
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,281
Congratulations!

2661
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,771
No, no, no! Wait.
We're gonna take pictures.

2662
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,444
Put it back on.

2663
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,886
Can you get a camera?

2664
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,371
Congratulations, baby.

2665
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:44,249
I don't know you, but congratulations!

2666
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,606
All right, look here.

2667
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:49,722
Smile.
Here we go.

2668
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,325
Oh, that's a good one.

2669
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,807
And good. Got it.

2670
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,162
We need...
Sam, where are you?

2671
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,446
- Samantha!
- Sam.

2672
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:59,201
And where's
Mason Senior?

2673
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:01,328
I'm feeling generous.
Come here.

2674
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:06,880
Great.
And beautiful!

2675
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:08,928
I'll email these
to everyone.

2676
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,043
Don't even start.
Don't start, don't start.

2677
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,401
Can't believe you guys came all this way.
It means a lot to me.

2678
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,606
Mmm...

2679
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:28,684
We wouldn't have
missed it for anything!

2680
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:33,089
I'm so proud of you.
Congratulations.

2681
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:36,689
I'm really sorry that Lee couldn't be here.
He's on his senior trip.

2682
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,405
No, tell him I said hi.
I will.

2683
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,921
Abby, I didn't even recognize you.
How old are you now?

2684
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,127
I'm 13.

2685
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:43,600
Wow.

2686
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,367
All right,
let's top her off.

2687
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:51,605
You want some, doll?

2688
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:54,331
Um, sure,
whatever. Yeah.

2689
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:55,640
<i>I got you something.</i>

2690
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,441
What is it?

2691
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,171
That is a savings bond.
That is worth something.

2692
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:02,765
It's better than money.
You'd just spend that.

2693
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,609
God, is that your mom?

2694
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:09,001
Yeah. Yeah. That's her. Wow.

2695
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:12,611
Three-second rule.
Put it on your plate.

2696
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,281
Such a good dad.
Really.

2697
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:15,441
I know.
I'm trying to help.

2698
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:17,409
Come here, you guys. I want to
make a little toast to Mason.

2699
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,605
Now, Mason, I know you didn't
really want to have a party today,

2700
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:24,523
but We did.

2701
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:28,491
And you only graduate high
school once in your life.

2702
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:32,762
So I want to celebrate you
and this next phase.

2703
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:34,490
And you're gonna learn
so much in college,

2704
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:35,641
you're gonna have
so much fun.

2705
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,563
You're gonna have
inspiring teachers,

2706
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:40,849
you're gonna learn more
about your art.

2707
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:42,809
I love you, babe.
So proud of you.

2708
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,920
- To Mason.
- To Mason!

2709
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:47,967
- To Mason.
- Here, here!

2710
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:52,123
All right,
you're up, kid.

2711
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,081
Oh, uh...

2712
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,847
All right, uh... Well, Mason,
I'll make a toast to the future.

2713
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:01,571
To your future.

2714
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:03,768
You know, it's been
a little sketchy

2715
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,171
this end of
the school year here,

2716
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:07,481
trying to figure out
what school to go to.

2717
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:10,450
Mason told me
that he wanted

2718
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,602
to get as far away
from home as possible,

2719
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:15,729
but still honor our agreement
that we pay in-state tuition,

2720
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:17,245
which I do appreciate.

2721
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:20,529
He's a prudent man and, uh,
he's gonna have a great future.

2722
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:21,840
So here's to you, buddy.

2723
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:23,241
To the future!

2724
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:25,251
Congratulations!

2725
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:31,448
Mason Junior! High school
graduate, 18 and straight!

2726
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,045
Just ignore him. My brother
needs to learn to pace himself.

2727
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:39,203
I've not known you
as long as everybody here,

2728
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:45,771
but since I have known you, you've
grown a lot and I'm proud of you.

2729
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:49,324
So, if this photography
thing doesn't work out,

2730
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:50,441
you know
you always got a job.

2731
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,568
Lose that earring. But...

2732
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,722
Uh, you know, maybe I can
get you front of house.

2733
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,290
All right.
To you, buddy!

2734
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:00,485
Sam, say something!

2735
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,770
Come on, Samantha.
Um...

2736
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:04,524
Come on, darling.

2737
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:06,245
Good luck.

2738
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,011
Aw...

2739
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,808
So you broke up
with your girlfriend?

2740
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:19,803
Yeah, yeah, just recently.

2741
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:21,041
What was her name?

2742
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,327
Sheena.

2743
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,922
She's gonna go to
college with you?

2744
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,365
No.
No?

2745
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,362
Hmm. She's staying in
this part of Texas.

2746
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:30,641
Okay-

2747
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:32,210
You need a ride
to college?

2748
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,447
I just wanted to say hello
before you got out of here.

2749
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,602
You guys met before, haven't you?
Annie, Aunt Jen?

2750
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,205
Yeah, we met at, uh...

2751
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,770
Sam's graduation.
Oh, yeah.

2752
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:44,444
And with your little one.
Where is he?

2753
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:46,887
Oh, he's at home.

2754
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,968
Remember? He was such a
pain in Sam's thing that...

2755
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,929
I would love to see him.

2756
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,048
We have a special weekend
this weekend, so...

2757
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,322
I'm so glad you
found her, I really am.

2758
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,528
You've got him at
a good time, I think.

2759
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,443
I think so, too.
Yeah.

2760
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,760
It's good to see you two.

2761
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:01,966
Nice to see you,
too,Jen.

2762
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:03,405
So proud of your boy.

2763
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:05,369
Yeah. Yeah,
we all are.

2764
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:10,801
She's a bitch and a half.

2765
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,567
You got to
remember, you're going

2766
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,051
to college, though,
all right?

2767
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:18,090
And if you're anything
like me or your old man,

2768
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:20,481
you're gonna be pulling
down some serious wool.

2769
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:22,483
You're gonna be tapping
some masterful gap.

2770
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,130
You're gonna be doing
some good work out there.

2771
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:26,567
Think about it. Awful lot
of flowers in that bouquet.

2772
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,165
But you got to
do me a favor.

2773
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:30,288
You're going to be vulnerable
this summer, all right?

2774
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:33,404
Remember to use protection
during breakup sex.

2775
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:37,926
This guy knows exactly of which I speak.

2776
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,571
Look what
happened to him. Voila'.

2777
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:42,091
Steven.

2778
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,925
Cheers.

2779
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:47,726
It's not that simple.

2780
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:50,485
Four more years.
Four more years.

2781
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,650
I'm just saying.

2782
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:57,681
Do y'all recycle?
Should I...

2783
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:59,000
I have one started there.

2784
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:01,321
Oh, yeah, right. Great.

2785
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,401
Am I your only ex at this party?

2786
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:10,770
Yes. I'm not your
only wife here, though.

2787
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,360
Yeah.

2788
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:19,923
Can you believe they're
both out of high school?

2789
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:22,811
No. No, I can't.

2790
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,807
You did a great job with
both of them, by the way.

2791
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,203
Thanks for saying that.

2792
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:33,046
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

2793
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:34,326
Well, it's true.

2794
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:36,205
Thank you.

2795
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:39,610
You're doing it
all over again, huh?

2796
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:41,603
I know, I know, right?

2797
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:45,966
It's gonna be 15 years
till I have an empty nest.

2798
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:47,481
Hmm.

2799
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,968
But I'd love to pitch in,
help with this, if I could.

2800
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:52,889
I mean, it's so great
that you did this.

2801
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,082
Can I just
give you a little?

2802
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:56,880
I'd appreciate it
if I could.

2803
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,530
Sure. Yeah.

2804
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:00,090
But l don't
have any cash.

2805
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:03,607
Oh, I know, it's in Annie's purse.
I'll be right back.

2806
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,605
So it sucks. I mean, the guy's
a college lacrosse player.

2807
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:15,091
What are you gonna do?

2808
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:17,447
She didn't even
like sports.

2809
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:18,851
You want a beer?

2810
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:20,126
No, that's all right.

2811
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,725
You can have one.
It's okay.

2812
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,282
Yeah, well,
for what it's worth,

2813
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:28,524
we've all been through the exact
same thing at one point or another.

2814
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:31,811
It's not the same, though. I
mean, you never got to know her.

2815
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:34,565
No, I know, I know.
It's not the same.

2816
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:37,288
I just don't know
what I did wrong.

2817
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:39,647
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, man.

2818
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:42,729
Hey.
Hey, Mason.

2819
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:45,650
We're up here raiding the green room.
Hope that's okay.

2820
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,841
That's totally cool.

2821
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:47,921
All right.

2822
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,328
Wow! Is that MJ?

2823
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:55,004
Uh-huh, right?

2824
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:56,884
Unbelievable.

2825
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:00,047
Well, we just decided to come a
little early, check you out.

2826
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:02,521
That's cool man, let me finish up.
I'll be up in a minute.

2827
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:05,444
All right. I guarantee you,
you didn't do anything wrong.

2828
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,082
These high school love
things, they never work out.

2829
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:09,361
Here, come here.

2830
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:12,728
I mean, everybody's just
changing so much, you know?

2831
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,327
The odds of two young people staying
on the same wavelength are...

2832
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:19,046
Yeah, but still... Look,
and I also guarantee you

2833
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,451
that every day
of your life

2834
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:22,568
that you spend crying
over some silly girl

2835
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:25,484
is a complete
waste of time.

2836
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:27,130
She wasn't
a silly girl, though.

2837
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,248
I mean,
she's a serious person.

2838
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:31,163
And I really
thought we were...

2839
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:32,366
What?

2840
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:34,408
I don't know.

2841
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:38,600
Here's the truth. Women
are never satisfied,okay?

2842
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,529
They're always looking
to potentially trade up,

2843
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:42,011
and that's,
I'm sorry to say,

2844
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:44,447
what I think has happened to
you, my fine-feathered friend.

2845
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:46,010
What does that even mean?

2846
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:49,527
It means don't hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila.

2847
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:50,886
Sheena.
All right.

2848
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:52,849
It means you are
responsible for you,

2849
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:55,844
not your girlfriend, not
your mom, not me, you.

2850
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,366
And if you truly
take care of you,

2851
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:01,250
you will be amazed at
how much girls like Sheena

2852
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,641
start lining up
at your front door.

2853
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:05,327
Great.

2854
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:08,531
You just gotta separate yourself
from the pack in some way.

2855
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:12,525
Excel at something, you know, and
then you have your pick of the litter

2856
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:15,007
when the front-runner hussies
start sniffing around.

2857
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:17,651
So what you're saying
is I should take up lacrosse.

2858
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:19,565
Exactly.

2859
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:21,483
Or you could,
you know, start a band.

2860
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:25,480
Worked for me a long time ago. I
think it's still working for Jimmy.

2861
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,171
Or you just
keep taking pictures.

2862
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:31,007
She hated the pictures
I took of her.

2863
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:32,884
I'm sick to death
of her, okay?

2864
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:36,282
I only met her a few times, and
yes, she was cute, all right,

2865
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:39,045
but truth be told, I always
thought she was a little bit...

2866
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:41,202
You know, a little
bit too square for you.

2867
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,726
You know,
not quite the same vibe.

2868
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:44,881
You really thought that?

2869
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,689
On some subtle,
lower level.

2870
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,522
I mean, I wasn't surprised

2871
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:54,844
when it turned out she was interested in
some Knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?

2872
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:59,767
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things, you know.

2873
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,481
I mean,
take your mom and me.

2874
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,530
I think I probably
turned into the boring,

2875
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,329
castrated guy
she wanted me to be

2876
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,602
15, 20
years ago, you know?

2877
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:11,921
I'm not saying she was wrong
to be pissed, I'm not.

2878
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,604
I'm just saying
that she could've been

2879
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,569
a little more patient,
little more forgiving.

2880
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:18,291
Would've saved me that
parade of drunken assholes.

2881
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,686
So, what's the point?

2882
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,526
Of What?

2883
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:35,051
I don't know,
any of this. Everything.

2884
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:39,090
Everything?
What's the point?

2885
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:41,731
I mean,
I sure as shit don't know.

2886
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:44,044
Neither does
anybody else, okay?

2887
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:46,726
We're all just
winging it, you know?

2888
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,809
The good news is
you're feeling stuff.

2889
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,645
And you've got to
hold on to that.

2890
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:55,289
You do. I mean, you get older
and you don't feel as much.

2891
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,124
Your skin gets tougher.

2892
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:58,690
The point is those
pictures you took,

2893
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:02,651
thousands of submissions from all
over the state, and you won.

2894
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,929
Well, I got silver.

2895
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:07,289
And nine other people did, too.
I'm gonna kill you.

2896
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:09,681
I'm trying to tell you
that I believe in you, Mason.

2897
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:11,125
I think you're really special,

2898
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:13,567
and if some girl doesn't see
that, then fuck her, you know.

2899
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:18,528
Hey, this next one of 'em goes
out to a young man in the house.

2900
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:21,684
Whoo-hoo! Known him since
he was just a small boy.

2901
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:26,329
Now he's all graduated from high
school and making me feel old.

2902
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:30,366
Happy high school
graduation, Mason.

2903
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:59,131
Thank you.

2904
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,561
Okay, guys, let's be clear. We're gonna
break this into four categories.

2905
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:05,881
One, anything you want to
keep from your childhood

2906
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,246
and you're taking with you.

2907
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:11,405
Two, throwing away.
Three, donating.

2908
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:13,887
And four, whatever you
want to try to sell

2909
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,405
at the garage sale
next weekend,

2910
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,721
whatever we don't sell,
we're donating.

2911
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:22,245
Doesn't the apartment have like an
attic, or storage or something?

2912
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:24,887
No. You're missing the point.

2913
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:28,170
We're not gonna drag a bunch of
crap to Mom's tiny apartment.

2914
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:30,729
Can't believe
we're moving again.

2915
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,165
No, I'm moving.

2916
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,005
You moved two years ago. You
have an apartment in Austin.

2917
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,243
Mason is
moving in the fall.

2918
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,210
I'm done.

2919
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,442
This'll be great for me.
I'll have all these options.

2920
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,170
I could take a sabbatical.

2921
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:45,641
I could get some writing done,
try to get published.

2922
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,768
What about Christmas, though?
What are we gonna do?

2923
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,729
I'm not sharing
a room with him.

2924
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,484
One of you will
sleep on the couch,

2925
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,688
and we'll use that
blow-up mattress.

2926
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:56,322
How am I supposed
to do my laundry?

2927
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:00,084
Sam, I'm gently
pushing you out of the nest.

2928
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:05,049
And on your way down, you may
magically find some quarters

2929
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,691
that you use to do laundry
in your own apartment.

2930
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:11,362
Come on!
You guys are adults!

2931
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,366
You need to take some responsibility.
Now, what do you want?

2932
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,088
I'm gonna get
the veggie burger.

2933
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:21,242
I'm not having anything,
not hungry.

2934
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:23,769
What's wrong with you?

2935
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,371
I'm sick.

2936
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:29,004
What is it, your head?
Do you have a fever?

2937
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,242
She's pregnant.

2938
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,686
No. To be honest, I drank
way too much last night.

2939
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,768
You weren't driving, were you?
No, no.

2940
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:41,244
Cary's back home, too,
and we just hung out.

2941
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:45,120
You know, peach Smirnoff s,
they just go down so easy.

2942
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:48,204
No, no. Hey,
that's not an excuse.

2943
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:50,044
You can still pack boxes.

2944
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:53,044
These people want to move in
as soon as possible.

2945
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,600
Hi, guys.
I'm Ernesto, how are you?

2946
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,251
You probably
don't remember me,

2947
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:00,448
but I worked on your
septic line years ago.

2948
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:01,567
Oh, yeah.

2949
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:04,408
Believe it or not,
you changed my life.

2950
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,721
You told me that day
that I was smart

2951
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,768
and that I should
go to school.

2952
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:11,970
I took your advice. I signed
up for English classes,

2953
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,082
and then a year later,
I went to community college

2954
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,366
and I got my
Associates degree,

2955
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:17,522
and I'm working on my
bachelor's now at Texas State.

2956
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,090
And also one of
the managers here.

2957
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:20,446
That's great.

2958
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:23,249
It's good to see you,
because I really wanted

2959
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,926
a chance to
thank you for that.

2960
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,480
Gracias. It really
meant a lot to me.

2961
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:33,087
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me.
It's the least I can do.

2962
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,604
You guys should listen to her.
She's a smart lady.

2963
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,611
Thank you.

2964
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,166
Isn't that kind
of crazy, though,

2965
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,730
that a computer
knows who you are

2966
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:58,565
from just 20 questions
off a form?

2967
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:01,849
I guess there are really only like
eight types of people in the world.

2968
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:04,082
I mean, there are subsets
like male and female,

2969
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:08,000
but apparently we're not as unique
as we want to think we are.

2970
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:10,168
Have you even
talked to this guy yet?

2971
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:13,722
No, but we've been trading emails.
He seems pretty cool.

2972
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:16,770
He's studying
literature and anthropology

2973
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:20,089
and he's way into Bright Eyes,
so that's not so bad.

2974
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:22,242
But, anyways, he was
telling me about how

2975
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:26,086
the system they use for assigning
roommates is kinda spooky.

2976
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:30,210
The freshman satisfaction rate for
new roommates used to be like 60%,

2977
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:33,284
and now it's 100,
just 'cause of the computer.

2978
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:36,883
Well, sounds like he'll be
a good roommate, then.

2979
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,927
Yeah. But we
pretty much decided

2980
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,287
that soon they won't even
need a questionnaire

2981
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:45,648
'cause they'll just let the
NSA scan your digital ghost

2982
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,688
and they'll tell you
who your roommate is

2983
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,367
based on everything you've
ever said, written or clicked.

2984
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:54,769
Did you put this
in here again?

2985
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,763
I don't want it.

2986
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:59,571
Come on, it's the first
picture you ever took.

2987
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:03,524
All the more reason to
leave it behind, right?

2988
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:22,207
What?
Nothing.

2989
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:24,488
No, what is it?
It's nothing!

2990
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:26,927
Mom.

2991
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,766
This is the worst
day of my life.

2992
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,520
What're you talking about?

2993
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:35,806
I knew this day
was coming.

2994
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,086
I didn't know
you were gonna be

2995
02:32:37,160 --> 02:32:38,924
so fuckin'
happy to be leaving.

2996
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:43,641
I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
What do you expect?

2997
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:47,289
You know what I'm realizing? My
life is just gonna go, like that.

2998
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,568
This series of milestones.

2999
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:53,242
Getting married. Having kids.
Getting divorced.

3000
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,767
The time that we thought
you were dyslexic.

3001
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,365
When I taught you
how to ride a bike.

3002
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:01,689
Getting divorced again.
Getting my master's degree.

3003
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:03,603
Finally getting
the job I wanted.

3004
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,082
Sending Samantha off to college.
Sending you off to college.

3005
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,363
You know what's next? Huh?

3006
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:11,442
It's my fuckin' funeral!

3007
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:15,608
Just go!
And leave my picture!

3008
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:21,601
Aren't you jumping ahead by,
like, 40 years or something?

3009
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:27,284
I just thought
there would be more.

3010
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:44,841
Hey, you must be Mason.

3011
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:46,087
Yeah. Dalton, right?

3012
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:48,441
Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.
Definitely.

3013
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:50,090
Are you cool with
this side of the room?

3014
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:51,321
Yeah.

3015
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:53,880
Got in this morning,
just moved my shit in, man.

3016
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:56,964
Well, yeah, I don't care.
No worries.

3017
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,371
Cool. Can I help you
with anything, man?

3018
02:35:58,440 --> 02:35:59,646
Any bags, any of that
stuff need brought in?

3019
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:03,202
I just got like one box left,
I packed pretty light.

3020
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:04,486
But I appreciate it.

3021
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,686
It's my pleasure, man.
Of course.

3022
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:11,284
Um... Are you going to
the orientation mixer thing?

3023
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:15,051
Orientation mixer thing?

3024
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,724
Fuck no, man,
I'm not going to that,

3025
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,006
and neither are you,
by the way.

3026
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,480
We got way better stuff to
be doing, dude. All right.

3027
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,886
You ready?
Yeah.

3028
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:24,201
Hey, Barb, this is my roommate Mason.
Mason, Barb.

3029
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:25,327
- Hi.
- Hey.

3030
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,761
You coming with us?

3031
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:28,287
Where're you going?

3032
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,723
Hiking. Yeah, man,
you should come.

3033
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,689
If we leave now we can catch the
late afternoon at Big Bend.

3034
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:33,841
You ever been before, man?

3035
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,649
Yeah, but not since
I was really little.

3036
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:39,964
Then all the more reason to come now, man.
That's why we're here, dude.

3037
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:43,527
Oh, Mason, this is
Nicole, Barb's roommate.

3038
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:45,167
Hey, what's up?

3039
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:47,721
Hi.
Mason, Nicole.

3040
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:48,801
So, you game?

3041
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,241
Sure.

3042
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,803
Here,
have the rest of this.

3043
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:57,203
Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick
in when we get in the mountains.

3044
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:58,930
Awesome. Let's go.

3045
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,164
Do they let you
major in that here?

3046
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:12,370
Well, it's not that serious here, so
I kinda train outside of university,

3047
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:15,410
but I'm taking all my basics like
History of Dance and all that.

3048
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,289
Nice.
Yeah.

3049
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,091
What do you teach?

3050
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:20,440
Oh, gosh.

3051
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:24,209
Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop.
Wow...

3052
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,245
Which one's
your favorite?

3053
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,401
Tap.

3054
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,527
Yeah?
Yeah.

3055
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:32,969
You get to like make up all your
own sounds, and there's no rules.

3056
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:34,405
Just like
creative freedom.

3057
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:36,130
That's great.
Yeah.

3058
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:37,770
That's why I love
teaching it, 'cause,

3059
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,410
I don't know,
it's so beautiful to me,

3060
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,847
and it's kind of dying
away in this generation,

3061
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,251
so, to be a part
of bringing it back

3062
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,481
to the kids is
really rewarding.

3063
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,840
Right, keeps it going.
Yeah.

3064
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:46,921
How old are they?

3065
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,610
Six to eight.
Wow.

3066
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:52,287
Yeah. They have no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

3067
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,448
They haven't reached
the awkward years yet.

3068
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,722
Yeah, not yet. It's coming.

3069
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:14,046
Hey-

3070
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:15,565
Hey.

3071
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,287
Dalton can be
crazy sometimes.

3072
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:30,445
He seems cool, though.

3073
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:33,251
Yeah. Yeah,
they're both really cool.

3074
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:38,569
How are you feeling?

3075
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:43,922
Great. Pretty great,
to be honest.

3076
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:46,606
Good.

3077
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:51,846
I'm really happy that
you're hangin' out with us.

3078
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:54,605
Yeah. Me, too.

3079
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:59,129
This moment's
having a falsieful whoregasm!

3080
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:02,330
It's like as if all of time
has unfolded before us

3081
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:06,121
so we could stand here and look
out and scream, "Fuck, yeah!"

3082
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:16,650
You know how everyone's always
saying, "Seize the moment"?

3083
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:22,971
I don't know, I'm kinda thinking
it's the other way around.

3084
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:26,610
You know, like,
the moment seizes us.

3085
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:29,331
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

3086
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:33,608
It's constant.
The moment, it's just...

3087
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:37,644
It's like it's always
right now, you know?

3088
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:41,805
Yeah.
