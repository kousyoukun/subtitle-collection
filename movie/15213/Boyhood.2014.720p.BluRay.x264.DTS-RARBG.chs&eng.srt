00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:11,231
这是怎么回事
And there's a pool.

144
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,547
并有一个水池。

145
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,101
妈妈，你还爱爸爸
Mom, do you still love Dad?

146
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,625
我还是爱你的父亲。
I still love your father,

147
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,119
但是，这并不意味着 曾经健康的呆在一起。
but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together.

148
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:31,598
如果，这一举动后， 他找不到我们
What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't?

149
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:33,715
这不会是一个问题。
Oh, that won't be a problem.

150
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,820
你可以叫奶奶。
He can call Grandma and she'll tell him,

151
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,058
或拨打号码的信息。
or he can call Information.

152
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:41,035
我们会很容易找到。
We won't be hard to find.

153
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,740
你还在阿拉斯加
Is he still in Alaska?

154
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,668
因此，你的叔叔说。
Well, that's what your uncle says.

155
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:48,365
驯服北极熊什么的。
Probably taming polar bears or something.

156
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:52,036
我希望熊驯服他。
Yeah. Well, I hope they're taming him.

157
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:55,468
家具移动和存储

158
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,035

163
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:19,045
和入口的整个内部。
behind the door and all around the doorways on the inside.

164
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,882
他说，他将前来参观。
She says we're gonna come visit

165
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,939
我会写信给你打电话。
and I'm gonna write and call you.

166
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:29,624
等一下。 还有在其他线路上的呼叫。
Oh, wait, hold on a second. I'm getting another call.

167
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:31,617

170
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,810
我在其他线路。再见。

驴索菲亚

173
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:44,744
我给你的指令 为侦察兵。
I'm gonna be sending Sailor Scout instructions.

174

响应并告诉我如何 是其他侦察兵。

Goodbye, house.

181
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,009
I'll never like Mommy as much for making us move!

182
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:14,832
萨曼莎！你为什么不说再见 也是低劣的态度呢
Samantha!

183
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,250
Why don't you say goodbye to that little horseshit attitude, okay?

Hey! Put the pillow between you.

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,051

00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:00,397
我们会玩一种叫做 “沉默的比赛。”

她希望我。
No, that's okay. She's expecting me.

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,003
A lot to juggle.

284
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,257
你拥有了一切
- You guys got everything? - Yeah.

285
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,016
告别奶奶。
All right, say goodbye to your grandmother.

286
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,699
- 再见！ - 我在途中！
Bye, Grandma.

287
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,268
一会儿,,,,,,
All right, let's roll. Uh, no, wait a second.

288
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:36,507
你不喜欢 礼物，对不对
You're not the type of kids who like presents, are you?

289
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:38,411
- 是的！ - 不，你,,,
Yes! No, you don't.

290
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:40,662
礼物真的吗来吧！
Of course we do. Presents? Really? Let's do it!

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,286
Yay!

292
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,691
- 我要去！ - 我想去！
I call front seat!

293
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,026
梅森在向外的旅程 和萨曼莎在后面。
I wanted the front seat, though.

294
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,084
All right. Well, Mason gets it on the way there

295
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,594
顶部。
and Samantha gets it on the way back.

296
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,307
- 安全带！ - 腰带。当然！
- Hop in there. - Seat belts!

297
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:53,773
不要忘记带。
Seat belts. All right. Seat belts.

298
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:56,547
无论是有这个汽车座椅。
Don't forget your seat belts.

299
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,485
It's not like this car has any seat belts.

300
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,201
Mmm...

301
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,229
好吧。好吧。好吧！
Nice. Nice. Nice!

302
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,514
很好！
Come here, come here, yes!

303
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,780
过来！是的！
Oh, that was awesome!

304
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:10,709
这是真棒！
Get up there, Mason! Get up there! It was so good!

305
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,013
现在的你，梅森，倒是你！ 这是非常不错的！
Come on.

306
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,122
来吧！
Let 'em know who you are, buddy.

307
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:19,041
告诉他们谁 是你，朋友。我告诉了他。
Let 'em know who you are.

308
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,206
Mwah!

309
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,795
是的！是的！
Yes! Yes! Yes!

310
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,931
是的！
All right. All right, don't worry about it.

311
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,106
没关系。不用担心。
Wish we could use the bumpers.

312
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,036
我想我已经座无虚席。
Bumpers are for kids!

313
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:35,588
该站是儿童。 你有两年的时间
What are you, two years old?

314
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,081
他们所服务的停止。 生活不给你盖。
You don't want the bumpers.

315
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,928
Life doesn't give you bumpers.

316
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:46,274
他来了！现在！
There we, there we go. There we go! We got something there!

317
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,411
任何事情都会发生！
We got something! We got something!

318
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,926
Oh!

319
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:54,930
上一次我已经收拾好。 这是更有趣。
Last time I went bowling, we had bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

320
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,347
他们所服务的停止。
You don't want the bumpers, all right?

321
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:59,260
是所有玩低 停止，这意味着什么。
You bowl a strike with the bumpers

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,090
and it doesn't mean anything.

323
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,122
相信我。
Trust me.

324
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,898
里只存得很好。
Just lay it out on the lane.

325
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,820
一,,,,,,二,,,,,,三，,,,
One, two, three and...

326
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,536
VIVA EL的父亲！
Let's hear it for the father!

327
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,801
Boom!

328
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,969
- Get up there! - Great shot!

329
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,281
Get out there, girl!

330
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,865
四黑水员工们 野蛮攻击费卢杰。
<i>Four Blackwater operatives have been viciously attacked</i>

331
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,209
叛军放火 尸体和汽车，并,,,
<i>in their cars in Fallujah.</i>

332
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,888
<i>The bodies and cars were set on fire after insurgents started...</i>

333
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:33,142
看到了吗这是一场灾难。
Look at this! It's a disaster.

334
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,179
我会告诉你什么是发生在伊拉克。
Let me tell you what's happening in Iraq, all right?

335
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:40,219
正是每个人 想着我就知道会发生什么。
Exactly what every thinking person in the world

336
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,522
knew was gonna happen before they got started.

337
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:45,212
à布什和球迷谁 围绕他们该死。
But Bush and his little numb-nut fanatics he's got around him,

338
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:46,265
25分！
they don't give a rat's ass.

339
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,832
什么
That's a quarter.

340
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:49,163
你说“他妈的”。
What's a quarter?

341
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:50,762
宽恕。
You said A-S-S.

342
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,604
Oh, sorry. My bad.

343
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:57,581
我的老师说，这是一场正义战争 因为预防胜于治疗。
And my teacher says it's a good war,

344
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,883
because it's better to be safe than sorry.

345
00:17:57,606 --> 00:18:00,900
难道这就是他们教你吗 听你的父亲。
That's what they're teaching you in school?

346
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,362
All right. Listen to me. Listen to your father, okay?

347
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,087
这是一个谎言。这是天大的谎言。
That is the lie. That's the big lie.

348
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:07,104
伊拉克无关，与什么 双塔。我知道，对不对
Iraq had nothing to do with what happened at the World Trade Center.

349
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,930
我想。
You know that, right?

350
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,302
由谁来定投，乔丹
I guess.

351
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,410
Who you gonna vote for next fall, MJ?

352
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:14,739
- 我不知道。 - 你可以不选。有18岁。
I don't know.

353
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,810
He can't vote. He's not 18.

354
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:17,014
你投谁的
All right, who would you vote for?

355
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,741
- 佩里 - 任何人，但布什！行
Kerry?

356
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,171
Anybody but Bush! Okay?

357
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,589
你会回来住在这里
Are you gonna move back?

358
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,220
这就是我想要的。 我需要找工作。
Uh, I'm planning on it. You know, I gotta find a job.

359
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:29,344
你永远都挂出了妈
Are you and Mom gonna get back together?

360
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:33,913
我不知道。不,,,,,,只是取决于我。
I don't know.

361
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,929
That's not, uh, entirely up to me, you know?

362
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:41,360
我记得当我六岁。 你和妈妈像是疯了。
I remember when I was six,

363
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,125
you and Mom were fighting like mad.

364
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,825
你叫得那么大声和母亲哭了。
You were yelling so loud and she was crying.

365
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:46,944
是，你还记得吗
That's what you remember, huh?

366
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:47,966
是的。
Yep-

367
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,314
你不记得了加尔维斯顿旅游
You don't remember the trips to Galveston,

368
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,215
而当我们在扎营 大弯和有乐趣
camping in Big Bend, all the fun we had?

369
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,248
号
Nope.

370
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:57,421
- 你有没有生气，你妈妈呢 - 是的。
You ever get mad at your mother?

371
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,544
- 那你的兄弟吗 - 是的！
Yeah.

372
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,565
- 他们有你哭了 - 是的，当然。
You ever get mad at your brother?  Yeah.

373
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,242
Yeah. You ever yell at him? Oh, yeah.

374
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,138
但是，这并不意味着 不想要的，不是吗
Doesn't mean you don't love him, right?

375
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,118
当你是一个成年人了同样的情况。
Mmm...

376
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,765
Look, the same thing happens when you're grown up, all right?

377
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:10,939
你生气的人。 没什么重要的。
You know, you get mad at people.

378
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,721
You know, it's not a big deal.

379
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,840
你在阿拉斯加做什么
What'd you do in Alaska?

380
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,000
我曾经在船上,,,一会,,,
I worked on a boat for a while. Um...

381
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,839
我试着谱曲。
I tried to write some music.

382
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,754
你有没有看到一只北极熊
Did you see any polar bears?

383
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:26,452
没有，但我看到了科迪亚克熊。 在他妈的是巨大的！
No. But I saw a Kodiak bear.

384
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:29,506
爸爸！他们是50美分 用这个词！
It was fuckin' huge!

385
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,929
Dad! That's 50 cents for the F-word!

386
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,272
宽恕。
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:36,103
拿一块钱。留着零钱吧。
Here, take a dollar, all right? Keep the change.

388
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,634
我将现在看到的更加频繁。
You guys are gonna be seeing a lot more of me. Okay?

389
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,484
我错过了很多。我想让他们知道。
I missed you two real bad while I was gone, okay, I want you to know that.

390
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,492
我需要自己的时间。
I just needed to take some time, you know, to...

391
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:52,175
你妈妈，我,,,
Just“

392

Well, your mother, okay, is a piece of work, all right.

394
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,182
我想他们知道。
I think you know that by now, all right?

395
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,914
而我,,,,,,我很高兴 与你同在2。
And I'm just...

396

而遗憾的停止的问题。
I'm so happy to be with the two of you, okay?

397
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:08,816
我觉得我比这更好的。是不是好
And I'm sorry about that bumper business.

398
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm gonna get better at stuff like that, okay?

399
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:15,197
这是我在滴水泉发现 罗迪和,,,我的朋友给了我这个。
I got that one at Dripping Springs,

400
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,287

蛇驴脊椎骨呸！
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting. Huh?

408
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:30,786
梅森，我不希望你来收集 多个椎骨蛇。
Mason, I don't want you collecting snake vertebrae anymore.

409
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,592

我可以去除灰尘。

The boys didn't finish raking leaves.

673

They don't hear it. Goes in one ear and out the other.

687
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,888
爸爸没有任何意义上的灰尘。
But, Dad, I mean, dusting is pointless.

688
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,112
是的是的。 它只是你不喜欢它。
It's not pointless, you just don't like to do it.

689
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:12,527
谁花今天的掸子
But, I mean, who dusts anymore?

690
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,496
你当我们告诉你！

Yeah. And he's still your best friend?

725
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,578
我想是这样。

No, that is not how we are going to talk to one another. All right?

737
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,671
我不会是那个家伙。
No, I will not be that guy. You cannot put me in that category, all right?

738

"and the horn broke off, so now it's a zebra," okay?

749
00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:19,465
“但我认为它会带我像10”
"But I still think I'm gonna get an right?

"what a hard time you had quitting smoking, Dad."

756
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,128
这是怎么回事就那么难吗
How 'bout that? Is that so hard?

757
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:35,433
这些问题 很难回答。
Dad, these questions are kind of hard to answer.

758
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,538
什么是这么难 描述一个雕塑
What is so hard to answer about what sculpture are you making?

759
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,785
这是抽象！
It's abstract.

760
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:41,786
行。好的，好的。
Okay. Okay, that's good.

我对此不感兴趣。 í效劳。

你做了什么
Do you have a girlfriend? What have you been up to?

768
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,839
你说得对。
I see your point.

769
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,940
因此，我们必须离开 一切顺其自然，对不对
So we should just let it happen more natural, right?

770

这就是你说的。
That's what you're saying?

That's how you want to catch it, just like that.

793
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,510
做到这一点。

Guy's incredible. He's unhittable this year.

803
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:12,562
所以，他们知道他们在看。
Now, just so you know, what we're watching here is history.

804
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,842

This guy's ERA is 1.47, all right? Can you believe that?

808
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:23,289
你能相信吗
Now, if the Astros could just get a few runs, maybe we'd win a game.

809
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:26,465
如果太空人可以做一些 基地，我们会赢得比赛。

810

我是唯一一个拥有武器 没有人能带来什么
What, I'm the only one with any arms around here?

837
00:41:02,574 --> 00:41:03,882

01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,726
什么是第二
And what's the second way?

1269
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,349
- 你要去哪里 - 洗手间。
Where you going? Bathroom.

1270
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:33,436
没有必要去洗手间。 坐，梅森。
You don't have to go to the bathroom.

1271
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,126
Sit down, Mason, just sit down.

1272
01:05:35,194 --> 01:05:36,694
什么是第二种形式
What's the second way?

1273
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:41,252
她的母亲并没有说过他们谈这个
Huh?

1274
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,044
Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff?

1275
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:44,162
- 爸爸。 - 不，伤势严重。 你刚才讲,,,
No,Dad!

1276
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,725
No, come on, has she talked to you about

1277
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:45,826
避孕药
contraception?

1278
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:51,374
什么你有没有,,,,,, 避孕套，你教训他们一下吗
Huh?

1279
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,370
What, has she... Condoms?

1280
01:05:51,399 --> 01:05:52,899
- 爸爸，请。 - 什么
She talked about that? No, Dad, please, stop.

1281
01:05:52,924 --> 01:05:54,924
- 别闹了，请。 - 加勒特有,,,,,,
What?

1282
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:56,060
- 天啊！ - 什么
Does Garret have a condom? Oh, God!

1283
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,540
山姆，我们需要谈论这个。
Dad!  What? Come on.

1284
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,848
Sam, we have to be able to talk about this, all right?

1285
01:05:59,565 --> 01:06:01,196
来吧，我们可以。
Come on, we do. We can do it, we can do it.

1286
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:04,776
刚听我说完好吗 这是如此艰难，我和你。
Just stay with me here, all right?

1287
01:06:04,802 --> 01:06:08,011
说真的，我看过一篇文章 在报纸的一天，
It's as hard for me as it is for you. But seriously, all right?

1288
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,680
I read an article in the paper the other day that said

1289
01:06:08,036 --> 01:06:13,087
他说，虽然青少年 美国是不是性活跃
that although US teenagers are not the most sexually active,

1290
01:06:13,112 --> 01:06:15,751
有平等的速率 最高怀孕。
we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy, okay?

1291
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:17,606
你好。

1301
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,845

1306
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,770

不要像她那样。
Don't look at me like that, all right?

1318
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:08,330
好了，结束吧。
Look, just to finish the point, okay?

1319
01:07:09,185 --> 01:07:13,252
我23岁的时候你出生。 涂妈妈Tambien。
I was 23 when your mom had you, all right? So was she.

1320
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:17,429
我们没有放在最好的 情况是伟大的父母。
All right, and we didn't put ourselves

1321
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,844
in the best position to be great parents.

1322
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:22,373
我会是一个好父亲,,,,,, 你们两个，你知道吗
And I wish that...

1323
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,286
I wish I were a better parent to you guys, all right?

And I hope that you can learn from my mistakes, okay?

1325
01:07:27,535 --> 01:07:28,838
即使用了安全套。
All right. So wear a condom, okay? Oh!

1326
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,384
或,,,加勒特,,,等等。
Or get Garret to...

1327
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,286
I don't know, whatever.

1328
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:41,648
听这首歌。
Listen to this song, all right?

1329
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:46,429
我想忙
<i>I try to stay busy</i>

1330
01:07:46,454 --> 01:07:49,840
传统的歌词和“国家” 传统的老学校。
Just straight-up... The lyrics in this,

1331
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:52,740
我洗洗碗，短草
straight-up old-school country song.

1332
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,811
<i>I do the dishes I mow the lawn</i>

1333
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:56,813
听产品的质量。 这就像,,,,,,“艾比路”
Listen to the production of this.

1334
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,764
Production's like <i>Abbey</i> Road or something.

1335
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:58,625
尽可能保持忙碌

1336
01:08:00,474 --> 01:08:04,033
虽然我知道你永远不会
<i>Even though I know You're not coming home</i>

1337
01:08:04,058 --> 01:08:06,654
你知道，女人离开了。传统。
You know, his old woman's gone.

1338
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:07,804
酷。
Straight-up. Nothing fancy.

1339
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:10,419
我尽量保持屋内整洁
<i>I try to keep the house nice and neat</i>

1340
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:16,510
我把我的床，换床单
<i>Make my bed I change the sheets</i>

1341
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:23,364
直到我学会了用洗衣机
<i>I even learned how to use the washing machine</i>

1342
01:08:24,616 --> 01:08:29,547
拥有一切的清洁并不能改变什么
<i>Keeping things clean Doesn't change anything</i>

1343
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,896
我想，我有你的专业知识。
Yeah, I think she's about to get her master's degree.

1344
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:34,074
你会寻求教学工作
Well, then she's gonna start applying for teaching jobs?

1345
01:08:34,099 --> 01:08:35,427
我认为他做了什么。
I think she already has.

1346
01:08:35,452 --> 01:08:36,811
是吗在哪里
Really? Where?

1347
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:39,485
- 无处不在。 - 为什么所有的德州
All over.

1348
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:43,021
- 是 - 。如果你有移动 你必须移动。这没什么大不了的。
All over Texas? Yeah.

1349
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,211
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know? It's no big deal.

1350
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:44,171
我们会处理。
We can handle that. I'll still come get you every other weekend.

1351
01:08:44,196 --> 01:08:46,494
我会继续下去，每两个星期。
I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something,

1352
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:50,997
如果你在800千米左右移动 驱动器必须是更长的时间。
it'll just be a little bit more car time.

1353
01:08:51,404 --> 01:08:52,359
这是没有问题的。
No big deal.

1354
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:55,157
- 我生病移动。 - 当然。
I'm just kind of sick of moving.

1355
01:08:55,434 --> 01:08:57,888
但你永远不知道。 也许我得动。
Well, I bet you are.

1356
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,761
But, you know, you never know.

1357
01:08:57,956 --> 01:09:00,020
我的工作，以 一家保险公司。
I might have to move. Right?

1358
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,323
I'm working for this insurance company now.

1359
01:09:00,045 --> 01:09:02,493
这些公司 购买和出售所有的时间。
These places get bought and sold all the time.

1360
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:03,999
我们必须接受它。
You know, we'll just roll with it.

1361
01:09:04,928 --> 01:09:06,655
我以为你是一个音乐家。
I thought you were a musician.

1362
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,824
我，但是,,,,,,生活是昂贵的，你知道的。
I am,

1363
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,926
but life is expensive, you know?

1364
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:13,224
你要负责。
Guy's got to be responsible.

1365
01:09:13,803 --> 01:09:14,749
你有什么感想
What do you think?

1366
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,046
Hey! Hey!

1367
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:20,901
嘿，你！什么是不尊重！
Oh. you!

1368
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,560
Punk kid! You got no respect!

1369
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,010
而在保龄球馆的红发
You know that redhead at the bowling alley?

1370
01:09:29,035 --> 01:09:30,228
是啊，这是怎么回事
Sure. What about her?

1371
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:34,926
- 你认识她吗 - 我们已经见过几次。
Do you know her well?

1372
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,440
Uh, you know, we've hung out a little bit.

1373
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:37,940
是你的女朋友吗
Is she your girlfriend?

1374
01:09:39,565 --> 01:09:40,820
你是什么意思
How do you mean?

嗯,,,,,,你吻
Like, have you kissed her?

1376
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,521

是的。是啊，我已经吻了。
Yeah. Yeah, I've kissed her.

1378
01:09:50,492 --> 01:09:52,184
和你你有女朋友吗
What about you? Have you got a girlfriend?

1379
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:53,933
类似的东西。
Sort of.

1380
01:09:55,361 --> 01:09:56,402

Really?

1381

0h. yeah!

1386
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,771
How did that go?

1387
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,887
Pretty terrible.

1388
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:10,686
为什么呢
Why?

1389
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:13,704
在学校里，我们可以 谈很多事情，但,,,
Well, when we're at school, we got plenty to talk about,

1390
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:17,777
手机似乎 我们没有任何共同之处。
but when we're alone or on the phone,

1391
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,889
it's like we have nothing in common.

1392
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:18,721
什么
Nothing?

1393
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:22,438
不感兴趣的音乐 和电子游戏,,,,,,
She's not interested in music or video games or...

黑暗骑士一战 电影和菠萝快车
<i>Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and Pineapple Express.</i>

1396
01:10:27,034 --> 01:10:28,917
- 那又怎样 - 它说，所有的臭！
Yeah, what about 'em? She said they all sucked.

1397
01:10:28,942 --> 01:10:30,446
你对什么感兴趣
Okay, what's she interested in?

1398
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:33,904
我不知道。去市区 与他们的女朋友傻购物。
I don't know.

1399
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,721
Going to the mall with her stupid friends?

1400
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:36,764
- 是她漂亮吗小心那里。 - 是的。
Well, is she cute? Watch your step there.

1401
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,404
Yeah. Yeah? All right.

1402
01:10:38,971 --> 01:10:40,099
做到以下几点。
Well, here's what you do, all right?

1403
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:45,085
首先，你做了很多的问题。
First off, you gotta ask her a lot of questions.

1404
01:10:45,364 --> 01:10:49,485
然后，你要听 反应。证明对她的兴趣。
Then you have to listen to the answers, all right?

1405
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,080
Actually be interested in her, all right?

1406
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:53,540
如果你能做到，你会 光年领先于他人。

你离开你的兄弟！
You stranded your brother!

1552

你开始弹奏乐器 而女生排队吸你的家伙。
You don't even have to play that well.

1641

Not very long. Um...

1695
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:28,542
之后的夏令营。

他们称之为街头艺术。
Well, they call it "urban art." Oh.

1698
01:23:33,018 --> 01:23:35,018
为了看起来不那么非法的，但,,,
So it sounds, you know, less illegal

1707
01:23:56,286 --> 01:23:58,365

It doesn't really mean anything, though.

1708
01:24:01,415 --> 01:24:03,443
- 是你爸爸 - 是的。

我们找到了一种方法来放大 我们的iPod播放器在车内。
So, anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods

1725
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,923
to the external speakers on the ASB.

1726
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,771
当我们到达一个村庄， 知道456是有,,,
So every time we come rolling into town,

1727
01:24:41,796 --> 01:24:43,642
因为我们跳，
you knew the 4-56 was there

1728
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,167
在这里跳，跳到那里。
'cause we were bumping House of Pain.

1729
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,968
It was like, "Jump around, jump around."

1730
01:24:45,728 --> 01:24:48,699
出了整个家庭。 是孩子们和,,,
And the whole family's coming outside,

1731
01:24:48,724 --> 01:24:51,220
母亲和父亲跳了一切。
you got the kids and, uh, the mom and the dad

1732
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:53,474
我们扔糖果的孩子，
and they're all bouncing up and down,

1733
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,921
we're throwing out candies for the kids

1734
01:24:53,499 --> 01:24:56,651
足球，娃娃和飞盘。
and soccer balls and Beanie Babies and Frisbees, uh,

1735
01:24:57,547 --> 01:25:02,172
香烟的成人和,,, 真正爱过的佳得乐。
smokes for the adults,

1736
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,521
and, uh, they loved, they absolutely loved Gatorade.

1737
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,396
但由于某种原因， 讨厌柠檬，酸橙的香味。
But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor.

1738
01:25:05,421 --> 01:25:06,715
我不知道发生了什么事。
I don't know what it was.

1739
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,133
或送人。

多久是你吗
How long were you over there?

1741
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:14,398
服务两个时期 在伊拉克，一个在波斯尼亚。

是的，我是在保护 国家勉强读完高中。
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I was, um, Army National Guard,

1745
01:25:23,364 --> 01:25:26,519
需要钱 大专及优厚的薪酬。
and, you know, coming straight out of high school,

1746
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,171
needed money for college.

1747
01:25:26,614 --> 01:25:27,857
我做了我的任期。
Seemed like a decent paying job.

1748
01:25:27,882 --> 01:25:31,877
最后，我说，'如果我将返回 有事去改变世界。 “
And, uh, did my tour.

1749
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,440
And whenever I got done I told them,

1750
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,370
if there's a world-changing event, I'll come back.

1751
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:36,284
三个月后 发生了什么事双塔和背部。
And, uh, three months later 9/11 happened, and I was back 9/12.

1752
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:41,053
我很自豪的是，在整个 一次我在那里的456，
And I'm proud to say the 4-56, the whole time we were there,

1753
01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:43,431
从来没有失去任何人，没有之一。
we never lost a guy, not one casualty.

1754
01:25:43,456 --> 01:25:45,383
这是奇怪的，不寻常的
But is that odd? Is that unusual?

1755
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:46,890
是的。
Yeah. Uh...

1756
01:25:47,695 --> 01:25:49,186
几乎是不可能的。
Almost impossible.

1757
01:25:49,668 --> 01:25:52,660
这些谁进来，以取代美国,,,
Like, the guys that came along after us and replaced us,

1758
01:25:52,685 --> 01:25:57,644
他们没有听到我们 建议。他们向后所做的一切。
they didn't listen to any of our advice.

1759
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,006
They did, basically, the polar opposite of what we did,

1760
01:25:57,669 --> 01:26:00,028
他们失去了 七名士兵在第一个月。
and they lost seven guys in the first month.

What did you guys do differently?

1763
01:26:05,155 --> 01:26:08,092
我倾向于认为是 互相尊重的问题。
I like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know.

1764
01:26:08,805 --> 01:26:11,387
所有的时间 致力于建立信任，
All the time we spent over there building trust,

1765
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:14,308
他们摧毁了它三天。
these guys basically destroyed it in three days.

1766
01:26:14,682 --> 01:26:17,035
据当地人， 为什么我们没有
So, what did the locals think about why we're there?

1775
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:41,935
给我发短信。
All right. You better text me.

1776
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,524
你有什么胶
Mmm...

1777

1780
01:27:54,807 --> 01:27:56,777

And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad

1781
01:27:56,802 --> 01:27:59,497
愧疚与救赎 自己的退休，好像,,,
and trade off their own pension,

1782
01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:01,313
不管这会破坏这个国家。
as if that's what's been corrupting this nation.

1783
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,124
Yeah, because those who heart Fox,

1784
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,884
in my opinion, are being lied to.

1785
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,610
Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin.

1786
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,284

01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,810
Yes. This is better, yes,yes,yes.

1825
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,774
感谢您的相机 你给了梅森。
Hey, listen, thanks for that camera you got Mason.

1826
01:29:42,195 --> 01:29:44,927
- 一个梅森喜欢摄影。 - 是的。
Oh, yeah, Mason's all into the photography. He's loving that thing.

1827
01:29:44,952 --> 01:29:49,511
他说，他希望把 她的衣柜里在黑暗的房间。
Yeah, I know.

1828
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,563
He's actually talking about turning his, uh, closet into a darkroom.

1829
01:29:49,536 --> 01:29:51,769
红灯亮并透露。一切。
Like the red light and the developing, the whole nine...

1830
01:29:51,794 --> 01:29:55,112
- 你不是有问题 - 我不会看到他了一个星期。
You all right with that?

1831
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,368
I probably won't see him for a week. Oh, yeah. Right.

1832
01:29:55,137 --> 01:29:56,478
他的乐趣。
But he's having a good time.

1833
01:29:56,596 --> 01:29:58,457
至少，他的重点是什么。
At least he's focused on something. Yeah. Yeah.

1834
01:29:58,482 --> 01:29:59,644
我喜欢。
That's what I like. Yeah, he's all about it.

1835
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:00,847
这种自身。
Okay, let's go grande.

1836
01:30:01,802 --> 01:30:03,151
好了，就到“大”。
It's good? It's better, yes. It's good.

1837
01:30:03,176 --> 01:30:05,551
很好。这是更好的，是的。

1838
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:13,364
你很聪明，你应该学习。
You know, you're smart. You should be in school.

1839
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:17,402
我喜欢学习， 我需要它，但,,,
Oh, I like school, I need school,

1840
01:30:17,427 --> 01:30:19,682
这很难。我整天上班,,,
but it's hard, I working all day.

1841
01:30:20,497 --> 01:30:24,529
去上夜校！教育 社区三级。它也不是很贵。
Go to night school at community college. It's pretty affordable.

1842
01:30:24,554 --> 01:30:27,283
做好的房子。看上去很不错。
You're doing a nice job with the house. It's looking great.

1843
01:30:27,308 --> 01:30:28,717
- 谢谢。 - 很好。
Oh, thanks. Really great.

1844
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:32,225
我们固定在这里和那里。 我们得到了它的廉价拍卖。
Yeah, you know, some fix-its here and there.

1845
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,591
现在我知道为什么了。
We got a good deal on a foreclosure, so now I'm finding out why.

1846
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,081
Yeah, really. Hey,bud! Hey.

1847
01:30:35,901 --> 01:30:37,903
- 生日快乐！ - 怎么样
Happy birthday, huh? What's that?

1848
01:30:37,928 --> 01:30:39,357
这是我们的新车！
What's that? That's our new car. Get in it.

1849
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:40,684
过来。
All right. Have a good weekend.

1850
01:30:41,009 --> 01:30:42,933
有一个美好的周末。

1851
01:30:44,175 --> 01:30:45,534
- 您好！ - 你好吗
How you doing?

1852
01:30:46,059 --> 01:30:47,647
- 很高兴见到你。 - 我也是。
Good to see you. You, too.

1853
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,885
Hey!

1854
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:50,966
你好吗
Hey, how are you?

1855
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,807
Ooh...

1856
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:56,029
你看起来棒极了。看！
You look great. Ooh!  Thanks.

1857
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,443
Look at him! Aw, he's got Mason's nose.

1858
01:30:56,775 --> 01:30:58,020
梅森的鼻子！
- Yeah, isn't he cute? - Yeah.

1859
01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:04,086
准备好了！我们有很长的路要走。
- All right! - Love you guys.

1860
01:31:04,111 --> 01:31:06,350
- 再见了，山姆！ - 小心驾驶！
We got a big drive ahead of us.

1861
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,566
Bye, Sam.

1862
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:05,766
You guys drive safe.

1863
01:31:07,975 --> 01:31:09,588
我们将在明天晚上。
All right. Well, we'll be back tomorrow night.

1864
01:31:09,914 --> 01:31:12,116
再见了，亲爱的。 我很高兴你出生！
Bye, honey. I'm so glad you were born!

1865
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,582
这是汽车,,,安妮 那你驾驶庞蒂亚克GTO
So, this is like Annie's car and you drive the GTO?

1866
01:31:32,607 --> 01:31:34,819
婴儿座椅不走与其他。
I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing.

1867
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:38,367
号正是我不得不卖掉。
Yeah, no. But I had to sell that anyway.

1868
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:39,886
什么
You what?

1869
01:31:40,615 --> 01:31:42,318
是的，我不得不卖掉。
Yeah, I had to sell that.

1870
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:44,803
还有,,,,,,你不再有
So it's gone?

1871
01:31:45,387 --> 01:31:48,871
集电极 加利福尼亚州支付我$ 22,000元。
Yeah, some sucker collector from California

1872
01:31:48,896 --> 01:31:51,748
我很好，因为 我用现金支付的。
paid 22 grand for it, which is great

1873
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,046
'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash.

1874
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:54,458
他8500美元很久以前已经支付。
I only paid $8,500 for that thing way back when.

1875
01:31:54,937 --> 01:31:57,126
在一般情况下，汽车 他们是可怕的投资。
Cars are generally a terrible investment, you know.

1876
01:31:57,151 --> 01:32:00,243
把它拿出来的机构 你会得到一辆二手车，
Soon as you drive them off the lot,

1877
01:32:00,272 --> 01:32:02,064
然后对值减小。
you got a used car on your hands,

1878
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,449
and the value's only dropping from there.

1879
01:32:02,089 --> 01:32:04,450
但是，如果照顾，
But if you take care of it, you know,

1880
01:32:05,485 --> 01:32:07,571
你是幸运的，这是一个经典，
and you get lucky and it's a classic,

1881
01:32:07,596 --> 01:32:09,105
价格上涨。
the value starts going up again.

1882
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:13,203
有些人付出几十万 美元的福特Shelby眼镜蛇。
Shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars

1883
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,123
for some Shelby Cobra.

1884
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:19,909
什么
What?

1885
01:32:20,836 --> 01:32:21,916
你不记得了
You don't remember?

1886
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:25,264
我怎么记得吗
Remember what? Really?

1887
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:26,171
真的吗

1888
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,249
你告诉我 这将是我的，当我转身16。
You said that was going to be my car when I turned 16.

1889
01:32:33,162 --> 01:32:35,802
什么没有，从来没有说过。
What? No, I didn't. I never said that.

1890
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,677
我记得。我是在小学三年级，
I remember. I was in third grade

1891
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:41,196
而你背着我的房子 安东尼・格尔，因为这是他的生日。
and you were taking me over to Anthony Nadar's house for his birthday,

1892
01:32:41,465 --> 01:32:44,205
我们花了几圈，因为 我们到得早。
and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block,

1893
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,331
你谈到多少 你喜欢你的车。
and he was talking about how much he loved your car,

1894
01:32:46,356 --> 01:32:48,955
“这将是梅森的时候，他变成16。”
and so you were all like, "Oh, this is gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."

1895
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,966
首先，我不记得说。 二，从来不说什么。从来没有。
All right, first off, I have no memory of that, all right?

1896
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,126
Second of all, I would never say that. Never

1897
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:57,727
但是你做到了。
Oh, you did, though.

1898
01:32:59,484 --> 01:33:00,821
梅森,,,
What?

1899
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,846
Mason.

1900
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:04,549
和你的妹妹吗 难道我要忘了呢
Come on, what about your sister?

1901
01:33:04,574 --> 01:33:06,013
来吧。这公平吗
I'm just gonna forget about her?

1902
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,128
Come on, how's that fair? Huh?

1903
01:33:07,772 --> 01:33:09,362
安东尼・格尔，脸,,,什么
Anthony Nagar. What...

1904
01:33:11,605 --> 01:33:13,103
来吧！
Are you...

1905
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,331
Oh, come on!

1906
01:33:14,799 --> 01:33:15,925
你不能,,,
I mean, you're not...

1907
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:23,128
你可以把一张脸 安葬，如果你想要的。
Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, all right,

1908
01:33:23,153 --> 01:33:25,191
但是，这个问题很简单:这是我的车。
but bottom line is, that was my car. All right?

1909
01:33:25,216 --> 01:33:29,184
我买了它，我照顾他， 我做了我想要它。
I paid for it, I took care of it,

1910
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,651
and I can do whatever I want with it. All right?

1911
01:33:30,395 --> 01:33:32,114
对不起，如果你有其他的希望。
I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it, but when you get older,

1912
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:35,140
但是，当你长大，你会 攒起来买自己的车。
you can save up and buy a car of your own.

1913
01:33:35,165 --> 01:33:36,810
而且是“酷”，因为我是。
Be cool like I used to be.

1914
01:33:38,818 --> 01:33:40,970
或者,,,,,,你可以买一辆面包车。
Or you can get a minivan.

1915
01:33:55,405 --> 01:33:57,718
你妈妈让你看这个
Does your mom actually let you watch this?

1916
01:33:57,743 --> 01:33:59,986
是的，她很喜欢这一点。
Yeah. She likes it, too.

1917
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,245
Oh, my God.

1918
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,685
Okay, well, have you ever seen her in concert?

1919
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:13,405
你有没有见过活的
No, but she's coming to Houston in April.

1920
01:34:13,894 --> 01:34:15,901
没有，但来到休斯敦四月。
She's coming to Houston? Mmm-hmm.

1921
01:34:15,926 --> 01:34:17,205
你来休斯顿吗
Your dad and I could get you tickets and you could stay with us.

1922
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:20,965
我们可以给你弄到票 您可以和我们呆在一起。
That'd be great! Yeah.

1923
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,614
- 这将是伟大的！ - 是的。

1924
01:34:26,979 --> 01:34:30,700
安妮，你会与我擦肩而过 拥有从梅森的礼物呢
- Hey, Annie? - Yup.

1925
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,684
Will you get me the little birthday present for Mason?

1926
01:34:30,725 --> 01:34:34,679
- 在这里，亲爱的。 - 需要一点解释。
Here, babe. All right.

1927
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,641
This one needs a little explanation, okay?

1928
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:37,017
打开它。
Open it up.

1929
01:34:38,457 --> 01:34:41,154
我把它称为“磁盘 黑色甲壳虫“。
I call that the Beatles Black Album.

1930
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,077
因为它是,,,
What it is, is the best of John, Paul, George and Ringo,

1931
01:34:43,102 --> 01:34:47,242
最好的约翰，乔治， 保罗和林戈分离后。
solo, post-breakup.

1932
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:48,779
谢谢。
Thanks.

1933
01:34:48,804 --> 01:34:51,301
简而言之， 聚集带你。
Basically, I put the band back together for you.

1934
01:34:51,326 --> 01:34:54,829
当你听到的很多东西 他们单飞，百无聊赖。
Whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff,

1935
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,010
it kind of becomes a drag, you know?

1936
01:34:55,154 --> 01:34:57,551
但是，你把彼此相邻，
But you put them next to each other, right,

1937
01:34:57,676 --> 01:34:59,798
和互利上升。
and they start to elevate each other,

1938
01:34:59,823 --> 01:35:01,494
然后你意识到。
and then you can hear it.

1939
01:35:01,519 --> 01:35:02,678
是披头士！
It's The Beatles, you know?

1940
01:35:03,461 --> 01:35:06,317
我不知道。我认为，保罗总是首选。
I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best.

1941
01:35:06,461 --> 01:35:08,607
不要紧。你不理解的想法。
It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point.

1942
01:35:08,632 --> 01:35:12,687
没有最喜欢的披头士！这是 我说的话。问题是平衡。
There is no favorite Beatle!

1943
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,848
That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance.

1944
01:35:12,712 --> 01:35:16,059
那是什么让妓女 摇滚乐队是世界上最大的！
That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band

1945
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,282
in the world, okay?

1946
01:35:16,984 --> 01:35:20,349
有十年 分散的音乐。
And there's this decade of music out there

1947
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:24,652
它经过精心定位， 组织和整洁的你,,,
that's been scattered, all right,

1948
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:24,124
and now it has been carefully found, arranged and ordered for you

1949
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:26,325
您慈祥的爸爸。
by your loving father.

1950
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:30,846
很有条理，整洁 几次爱你的爸爸。
Very arranged and very organized,

1951
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,001
over and over again by your loving father.

1952
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,542
当然！是的！看看这个。看看这个。
Yes, yes, yes.

1953
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,244
So, I mean, look at that, look at that.

1954
01:35:34,278 --> 01:35:36,291
前四个问题，第2卷。
Uh, top of volume ll, first four tracks,

1955
01:35:36,316 --> 01:35:40,480
从“波段上运行”到“我滴神啊” 一个“嫉妒型”到“摄影”。
<i>you've got Band on the Run into My Sweet Lord</i>

1956
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,804
<i>into Jealous Guy into Photograph. Come on!</i>

1957
01:35:40,505 --> 01:35:41,488
您好！
It's like the perfect segue.

1958

It's a work in progress.

2064
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,566
A week later, we don't know why

2065
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,847
Thomas wasn't there the first time, uh,

2066
01:41:03,865 --> 01:41:07,296
但一周 后来，汤姆返回,,,
but a week later, Thomas comes back

2067
01:41:07,321 --> 01:41:09,087
并与其他弟子去。
and joins the other disciples.

2068
01:41:09,112 --> 01:41:12,666
他们说:“耶和华是活的， ！因此，我们所看到的！ “”我不相信，
They say, "The Lord's alive, we saw him!"

2069
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:14,840
“直到他们把我的手放进他的身边，
"I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side,

2070
01:41:14,865 --> 01:41:17,431
“，感觉伤口在他的手里。”
"and I wanna see those nail prints in his hands."

2071
01:41:18,422 --> 01:41:21,510
就在这时到达 耶稣站在他旁边。
About that time, here comes Jesus

2072
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,841
standing right next to him, okay?

2073
01:41:22,675 --> 01:41:26,036
并期待在托马斯。 你看，他觉得托马斯的耻辱吗
And he turns to Thomas. Don't you know, Thomas felt some shame.

2074
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:30,689
托马斯看着他，说: “托马斯，摆在我的身边你的手。”
He turns to Thomas and says,

2075
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,491
"Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side.

2076
01:41:31,272 --> 01:41:33,432
“看我的伤口，是我！”
"Look at these nail prints. It's me."

2077
01:41:34,057 --> 01:41:38,089
和托马斯说: “我的主，我的上帝。事情，我想。”
And Thomas says, "My Lord and my God, I believe."

2078

耶稣说:“那就好。”
And Jesus said, "Well, that's good,

2079
01:41:41,318 --> 01:41:44,896
“不过祝福 那些谁相信没有看到。 “
"but blessed are those who can believe without seeing."

2080
01:41:45,887 --> 01:41:50,111
这是很容易当 你可以看到。和感觉。和触摸。
It's a lot easier when you can see and feel and touch,

2081
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:54,209
在我们的例子中， 我们还没有看到人。
but like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh,

2082
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:56,194
大家有没有觉得在人。

2083
01:41:56,219 --> 01:41:59,529
但是，我们已经感觉到 在我们的精神;少一些。
but we have experienced him in the spirit.

2084

01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:37,106
梅森，为什么还有那么过时
Mason, why are you such a stick-in-the-mud?

2097
01:42:38,143 --> 01:42:39,831
也不知道你在说什么。
What are you even talking about?

2098
01:42:39,856 --> 01:42:43,755
难道他们不关心回来 库珀的洗礼20天
You guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you,

2099
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,161
for Cooper's baptism?

2100
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,023
- 没问题。 - 山姆
No, that's fine. Sam?

2101
01:42:45,048 --> 01:42:48,657
谢谢。 这意味着很多安妮和她的家人。
I appreciate it.

2102
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,884
It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know.

2103
01:42:52,158 --> 01:42:53,798
是我们受洗我们吗
Were we baptized?

2104
01:42:56,527 --> 01:42:59,722
这不是白白 感兴趣的你灵魂的状态。
I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul.

2105
01:43:00,558 --> 01:43:04,391
我现在该我们做的， 如果你想。你和库柏一起
We can do it now, though, if you want.

2106
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,487
No, I think I'm all right.

2107
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,307
头淹没
You and Cooper together, you know.

2108
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,090
Dunk your heads.

2109
01:43:07,387 --> 01:43:10,331
你是不是会成为 神人吧爸爸
You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?

2110
01:43:10,356 --> 01:43:11,723
这意味着什么
And what's that supposed to mean, huh?

2111
01:43:12,148 --> 01:43:13,379
我听到了！
I can hear you!

2112
01:43:15,684 --> 01:43:18,069
我觉得猎枪 将在主场更好。
Oh, wow.

2113
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,321
I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh?

2114
01:43:18,094 --> 01:43:19,873
你妈妈会不会喜欢它。
I don't think your mom would love that.

2115
01:43:23,047 --> 01:43:25,430
当心，山姆。我会告诉你怎么做。
Look out, Sam.

2116
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,403
Let me show you how it's done.

2117
01:43:29,555 --> 01:43:30,622
好了，爸爸！
Nice, Dad.

2118
01:43:31,715 --> 01:43:32,981
即使我能！
Still got the goods, hmm?

2119
01:43:46,747 --> 01:43:50,622
- 你有没有来过多久，梅森 - 我不知道。
How long you been in here, Mason?

2120
01:43:51,227 --> 01:43:54,117
我有。全班。
I'm not sure.

2121
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,924
I'm sure.

2122
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,525
All class.

2123
01:43:54,746 --> 01:43:57,966
- 你完成你的图片日记 - 还没。
Did you complete your image diary?

2124
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,001
Not yet.

2125
01:43:58,557 --> 01:44:00,820
和你的数码联系表
Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet?

2126
01:44:00,845 --> 01:44:03,651
我缺乏。 但没多久。
Not quite, but it's not gonna take me long.

2127
01:44:04,444 --> 01:44:06,694
“还没。” “我没有。”
Not yet. Not quite.

2128
01:44:07,759 --> 01:44:10,366
当时 暗房是课外。
Dark room time is extra-curricular.

2129
01:44:10,391 --> 01:44:13,715
实际上，如今的 甚至不需要到这里来。
I mean, technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days,

2130
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,404
当然不是，如果它 你还没有完成你的任务。
and certainly not until you've completed your assignments.

2131
01:44:16,429 --> 01:44:17,744
这里的问题。
That's the deal.

2132
01:44:17,969 --> 01:44:19,246
对不起。
Sorry.

2133
01:44:19,534 --> 01:44:21,077
我很担心，梅森。
I'm worried about you, Mason.

2134
01:44:21,676 --> 01:44:23,732
- 为什么 - 我会告诉你。
Why is that?

2135
01:44:24,203 --> 01:44:26,138
图像交货,,,
I'll tell you why.

2136
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,842
The images you're turning in, they're cool.

2137
01:44:27,122 --> 01:44:30,948
酷。您正在浏览 唯一的东西。
You're looking at things in a really unique way.

2138
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:33,132
你有这么多的天赋。
Got a lot of natural talent.

2139
01:44:33,757 --> 01:44:34,614
谢谢。
Thanks.

2140
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:39,430
是的，但是这还没有得到 拿铁在这个世界上。
Yeah, but that and 50 cents

2141
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,044
will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world.

2142
01:44:40,571 --> 01:44:43,280
我接触过很多 有才华的人，多年来。
I've met a lot of talented people over the years.

2143
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:48,460
有多少人成功 作为专业人士,,,
How many of them made it professionally

2144
01:44:48,485 --> 01:44:53,228
没有纪律，决心， 而大量的工作
without discipline, commitment

2145
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,521
and a really good work ethic?

2146
01:44:54,307 --> 01:44:57,027
我告诉你！ 在我可以指望两个手指。
I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers.

2147
01:44:58,651 --> 01:44:59,516
零！
Zero.

2148
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:03,559
它不会发生，梅森。 这个世界太有竞争力的。
It's not gonna happen for you, Mason.

2149
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,689
The world is too competitive.

2150
01:45:03,584 --> 01:45:07,092
太多有才华的人 谁愿意去努力，
There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard,

2151
01:45:07,117 --> 01:45:09,242
并且还有谁没有太多的傻瓜,,,
and a butt load of morons who are untalented

2152
01:45:09,267 --> 01:45:11,968
天赋，但 他们已经准备好提高自己。
who are more than willing to surpass you.

2153
01:45:11,993 --> 01:45:14,968
许多 坐在课堂了。
As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom

2154
01:45:15,432 --> 01:45:16,716
你知道他们做了什么
out there right now, hmm?

2155
01:45:16,741 --> 01:45:19,848
任务，这是什么 你应该做的，
You know what they're doing?

2156
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,444
They're doing their assignments.

2157
01:45:19,873 --> 01:45:22,523
但你不是。 你在这里。为什么呢
Which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not.

2158
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,686
You're in here.

2159
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,091
Now why is that?

2160
01:45:23,342 --> 01:45:24,671
你是特别的，梅森
You special, Mason?

2161
01:45:25,446 --> 01:45:30,783
不可以，但在关于道德 工作中，我觉得我努力工作。
No, but the things you're talking about,

2162
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,204
like work ethic or whatever,

2163
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,930
I feel like I do work pretty hard.

2164
01:45:32,355 --> 01:45:35,311
很多时候，我花 整个周末拍照。
I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.

2165

2167
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:47,194
所以，我只是下令 你盖的大学比赛今天。

2168
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,602

2169
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,684

艺术是别的东西。
What can you bring to it that nobody else can?

2181
01:46:15,395 --> 01:46:18,045

加倍努力。
Try harder.

2184
01:46:24,376 --> 01:46:27,776
也许20年 克里斯蒂特灵顿先生叫老,,,
Maybe in 20 years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say,

2185
01:46:27,801 --> 01:46:30,145
然后你告诉他“谢谢你，先生”,,,,,,

2196

我们该怎么办
Why are we even doing this?

2197

它看起来像一个旧货店。
It's like an online junk shop.

- 我还以为你有一份好工作。 - 我有什么。

谁买这狗屎
You have to help.

2203

山姆，小心你说的话。 不要不尊重你的母亲。
Who even buys this shit?

2204
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,486
Hey. Sam, watch your mouth, all right?

2205
01:47:48,925 --> 01:47:51,012
要 屋顶在你的头上，对不对
Don't disrespect your mother.

2206
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,725
You like a roof over your head, don't you?

Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails.

2216

2234
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,451
Pretty good.

2235
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,010
How long have you been here?

2236
01:50:48,465 --> 01:50:51,018
- 我不知道。一会儿。 - 一会儿
I don't know. Awhile, I guess.

2237
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,371
Awhile?

2238
01:50:54,934 --> 01:50:57,170
我觉得有这么多,,,
I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing

2239
01:50:57,195 --> 01:51:00,779
我可以做的，并 我想要做的，但没有。
and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.

2240
01:51:00,804 --> 01:51:02,324
为什么不呢
Why aren't you?

2241
01:51:03,476 --> 01:51:07,299
我认为这是恐惧,,,,,, 什么人会想到。
I mean, I guess it's just being afraid of what people would think.

2242
01:51:07,324 --> 01:51:09,556
- 你知道，试验。 - 是的。
You know, judgment. Yeah.

2243
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:13,101
这很容易说，“不，我 不在乎别人怎么想“
I guess it's really easy to say like,

2244
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,090
"I don't care what anyone else thinks,"

2245
01:51:13,126 --> 01:51:15,365
- 但每个人问津。 - 这是正确的。
but everyone does, you know? Exactly.

2246
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:16,405
在后台。
Deep down.

2247
01:51:17,222 --> 01:51:20,784
我生气了很多人 与谁我联系,,,
I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with

2248
01:51:20,809 --> 01:51:23,708
因为我控制 或什么的，但是,,,
just for controlling me or whatever,

2249
01:51:23,942 --> 01:51:26,177
他们甚至不知道他们这样做。
but, you know, they're not even aware they're doing it.

2250
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,611
Yeah.

2251
01:51:30,006 --> 01:51:33,839
而在这个世界上 那里没有人玩完美,,,
So, in this perfect world, where no one's controlling you,

2252
01:51:33,864 --> 01:51:36,547
有什么不同什么样的变化
what's different? What changes?

2253
01:51:37,538 --> 01:51:41,242
一切。我只是想 做你想做的。
Everything.

2254
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,723
I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want,

2255
01:51:41,267 --> 01:51:43,371
这让我觉得活着。
because it makes me feel alive.

2256
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:46,765
而不是给我 正常的外观。
As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.

2257
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:49,277
不管它是什么。
Whatever that means.

2258
01:51:50,432 --> 01:51:51,996
我没有多想。
I don't think it means much.

2259
01:51:54,794 --> 01:51:56,843
你是一个有点怪异，你知道吗
You're kinda weird, you know that?

2260
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,807
Yeah?

2261
01:52:00,407 --> 01:52:01,630
它是一种恭维
Is that a compliment?

2262
01:52:01,655 --> 01:52:04,774
我不知道。想成为怪异
I don't know. Do you wanna be weird?

2263
01:52:05,883 --> 01:52:09,397
我不想吓唬,,, 孩子们在公园什么的。
I mean, I don't want to like scare kids at the park, or anything like that.

2264
01:52:11,782 --> 01:52:13,501
我喜欢跟你说话。
I really like talking with you.

2265
01:52:13,526 --> 01:52:18,246
我通常不尝试发声 我的思想，感情，或任何东西。
I don't usually even try to vocalize my thoughts

2266
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,371
or feelings or anything.

2267
01:52:19,445 --> 01:52:22,612
从来没有听起来不错。 话是,,,,,,愚蠢。
I don't know, it never sounds right. Words are stupid.

2268
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:25,862
而你为什么告诉我吧
So, why are you trying with me?

2269
01:52:26,899 --> 01:52:29,178
我不知道。我想是因为我感觉很舒服。
I don't know. I guess I feel comfortable.

2270
01:52:30,593 --> 01:52:31,666
我很高兴。
I'm glad.

2271
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:39,282
嗨，吉姆。对不起，我迟到了。
Hey, Jim.

2272
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,366
I'm sorry I'm so late.

2273
01:52:40,104 --> 01:52:41,931
你有什么时间去
What time are you supposed to be home?

2274
01:52:43,304 --> 01:52:45,113
我不知道。前一段时间。
I don't know. A while ago.

2275
01:52:46,475 --> 01:52:50,617
一个男人，而,,, 三十分钟一个小时
While ago like, 30 minutes ago, an hour ago?

2276
01:52:51,629 --> 01:52:55,094
没有人知道你在哪儿 直到你的姐姐说。
'Cause truthfully nobody even knew

2277
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,164
where you were until your sister told us.

2278
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,626
她到达较早。
She's been home for a while.

2279
01:52:58,150 --> 01:52:59,464
对不起。
I'm sorry.

但是,,,,,,你真的不关心。
See,but you don't actually care.

2282
01:53:07,164 --> 01:53:10,756
你来来去去，在您的休闲。
You just kinda come and go as you please,

2283
01:53:11,181 --> 01:53:13,788
你不关心，如果您 母亲而言，
and you don't care if your mom's upset,

2284
01:53:14,662 --> 01:53:17,143
或者你应该到什么时候。 是故事
or what time you gotta be home.

2285
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,930
Is that what's up?

2286
01:53:18,754 --> 01:53:21,376
- 我不知道该说些什么。 - 停止牙牙学语！
I don't know what to tell you.

2287
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,964
Stop mumbling!

2288
01:53:22,099 --> 01:53:23,426
你说句话啊！
You know, speak up!

2289
01:53:23,951 --> 01:53:28,109
不明白 字。听起来像“mhmmm”,,,,,,
I can't understand a word comin' out of your mouth.

2290
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,488
It's just like...

2291
01:53:28,316 --> 01:53:30,216
而我要问的问题，你只是,,,
And I ask you questions and you just...

2292
01:53:30,241 --> 01:53:33,205
它可以一天不 每个人都他妈的跟我
Can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass?

2293
01:53:36,026 --> 01:53:37,331

2294

这是我的家。

你知道吗，吉姆你不是我爸爸。
You know, Jim, you're not my dad.

- 美好的一天。 - 美好的一天。
Morning. Morning.

2306
01:54:27,308 --> 01:54:30,760
你们谁 用楼下的浴室昨晚
Hey. Which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last night?

2307
01:54:32,072 --> 01:54:34,248
我不知道。这不是我的。
I don't know. I didn't.

2308
01:54:34,273 --> 01:54:35,817
高，他叫什么名字
That tall guy, what's his name?

2309

- 菲利普 - 是的，菲利普。

Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can Phillip read?

2311
01:54:41,131 --> 01:54:42,112
菲利普读
You know, there's a big sign on the door.

2312
01:54:42,199 --> 01:54:45,163
牌子，上面写着: “不要使用这个卫生间坏了。”
It says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken."

2313
01:54:45,188 --> 01:54:47,175
就那么难吗
I mean, how difficult is that?

2314
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,703
我不知道。对不起。
I don't know. I'm sorry.

2315
01:54:54,962 --> 01:54:57,354
我认为这将使房子出售。
I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.

2316
01:54:58,389 --> 01:54:59,598
为什么呢
Why?

2317
01:54:59,623 --> 01:55:01,154
这是非常大的，我们。
This house is too big for us.

2318
01:55:01,179 --> 01:55:04,685
很快，你要上大学。 它是非常昂贵的。巴斯塔。
You're going to school eventually.

2319
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,008
It's too expensive. I'm done.

2320
01:55:05,473 --> 01:55:07,605
你买了什么
Why did you even buy it in the first place then?

2321
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:11,847
因为我爱服用 糟糕的决定在我的生活。
Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions,

2322
01:55:11,872 --> 01:55:13,866
而且有你在贫穷的边缘。
keeping us on the brink of poverty.

2323
01:55:15,694 --> 01:55:18,954
我花了一半 我生命中购买垃圾,,,
I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap,

2324
01:55:18,979 --> 01:55:22,074

01:55:25,429 --> 01:55:27,429
我摇了摇假两夫妻。
Well, I got rid of a couple husbands,

2328
01:55:27,454 --> 01:55:29,998
现在是到 按揭，维修，
now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage,

2329

2330
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,246

管道,,

2332
01:55:39,026 --> 01:55:42,034

You know what? From now on,

2333
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:41,528
lam gonna be Mommy Monk.

2334
01:55:43,129 --> 01:55:45,229
简单。独身。
Simple. Celibate.

2335
01:55:45,554 --> 01:55:47,029
这太烂了，妈妈。
Don't be gross, Mom.

2336
01:55:49,459 --> 01:55:53,309
好。然后，我将是一个 可怜的母狗带大房子。
Fine.

2337
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,282
I'll be a poor whore with a big house.

2338
01:55:54,685 --> 01:55:55,693
听起来是不是更好呢
Is that better? Hmm?

2339
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,085
Okay.

2340
01:56:02,673 --> 01:56:06,368
梅森，请 不要离开我脏板。
Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash.

2341
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:09,425
所有的一天，我洗碗。
I do dishes all day.

2342
01:56:09,450 --> 01:56:14,752
好吧！你是一个专业。您可以 洗一两个人你可怜的母亲。
Oh, great! Honey, then you're a professional.

2343
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,170
Come on, you could do one or two more for your poor old mom.

2344
01:56:15,278 --> 01:56:17,759
- 行。 - 谢谢。
Okay-

想要吗
You want one?

2347
01:56:44,061 --> 01:56:47,058
也感动。我看了所有的时间。
on, God!

2348
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,481
She didn't even touch them, seriously.

2349
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:49,419
为了谁，你观察到退化。
I watched her the whole time.

2350
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:48,925
I bet you did watch her, you little pervert.

2351
01:56:52,364 --> 01:56:53,676
这就像约会。
It's like we're on a date.

2352
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,234
身体健康！
Cheers.

2353
01:56:57,449 --> 01:56:58,831
一个浪漫的夜晚。
It's a night of romance.

2354
01:56:59,937 --> 01:57:01,715
但我不会吻。
Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you.

2355
01:57:03,798 --> 01:57:05,157
虽然我吸你。
I will blow you, though.

2356
01:57:13,961 --> 01:57:16,113
梅森！有紧急的休息室。
Mason! We are in the weeds out here!

2357
01:57:16,610 --> 01:57:18,153
í尽快做越好。
I'm goin' as fast as I can.

2358
01:57:18,178 --> 01:57:21,805
我一定是糊涂话。 因为最近我看到4月份聊天。
Oh, then I must be confused then,

2359
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:23,987
我们必须重新沙拉。
'cause I just saw you chattin' it up with April,

2360
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,049
when I got a salad bar that needs a refill,

2361
01:57:24,012 --> 01:57:26,456
6一个表，两个表 4，我不能用，
I got a six-top, two four-tops I can't use

2362
01:57:26,481 --> 01:57:28,307
因为他们是肮脏的。
because they haven't been bussed!

2363
01:57:28,332 --> 01:57:30,094
恩里克没来。我做我可以。
Enrique is not here. I'm tryin'.

2364
01:57:30,736 --> 01:57:32,487
好了，我们就麻烦了。
Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'!

2365
01:57:32,983 --> 01:57:34,939
那你告诉客户
What am I supposed to tell my customers?

2366
01:57:34,964 --> 01:57:39,463
“很抱歉的脏盘子， 但梅森做什么，他可以。 “
"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it,

2367
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,645
"but Mason's trying.

2368
01:57:39,787 --> 01:57:41,573
“这就是他告诉我的。”
"At least that's what he told me.

2369
01:57:41,598 --> 01:57:44,739
“4月份之后调情 吃了过虾“。
"After he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp."

2370
01:57:45,421 --> 01:57:50,093
我知道，今天是困难的。 但我想告诉你一件事。
Now it is a challenge out there today, I know,

2371
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,529
but I wanna share something with you.

2372
01:57:50,929 --> 01:57:53,195
我已经定你 服务员在今年夏天。
I got you pegged for fry cook this summer,

2373
01:57:53,342 --> 01:57:55,102
这是一个很多的责任。
and that's a lot more responsibility.

2374
01:57:55,127 --> 01:57:56,614
而更多的钱。
It's also more money. How's that sound?

2375
01:57:57,618 --> 01:57:58,602
你有什么感想
Good.

2376
01:57:59,434 --> 01:58:00,364
好吧。
I know you can handle that money,

2377
01:58:01,443 --> 01:58:04,829
我知道你可以用这笔钱，但 你可以处理的责任
but can you take the responsibility?

2378
01:58:05,915 --> 01:58:08,276
我想是这样。因为我相信你。
I think you can, because I believe in you.

2379
01:58:08,401 --> 01:58:09,997
我需要你在休息室。
But I need you on the floor.

2380
01:58:10,022 --> 01:58:11,622
离开菜肴和着急。
Now leave the dishes. Giddy up.

2381
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:14,352
来吧。不要让我失望！
All right, come on! Don't let me down!

2382
01:58:19,151 --> 01:58:22,550
它是否会奏效吗 是发电机不给更多的麻烦
<i>Well, so it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore?</i>

2383
01:58:22,918 --> 01:58:25,263
好吧。准备好了行程。
No, it's fine. It's up for the trip.

2384
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,840
Good.

2385
01:58:27,481 --> 01:58:30,029
你会看到在奥斯汀你姐姐
<i>Are you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?</i>

2386
01:58:30,054 --> 01:58:32,688
是啊，他说我可以留下来 在他的UNI宿舍。
Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool.

2387
01:58:32,713 --> 01:58:35,774
我觉得你的伴侣 旅行，所以没问题。
And I guess her roommate's out of town, so it's no big deal.

2388
01:58:36,036 --> 01:58:39,276
你已经申请了UT斯达康 您所要发送的形式
<i>All right. Did you apply there yet?</i>

2389
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,324
<i>Did you get that application in to UT?</i>

2390
01:58:39,301 --> 01:58:41,822
还没有，但希娜 实际上是接受了。
Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much in, though.

2391
01:58:41,847 --> 01:58:43,956
如果这就是你想要去的,,,
<i>Right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go,</i>

2392
01:58:43,981 --> 01:58:46,292
你应该postularte 为早日接受。
<i>you should probably do that early acceptance thing, you know?</i>

2393
01:58:46,317 --> 01:58:49,562
让他们知道你是 一个男人，谁知道他想要什么。
<i>Seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants.</i>

2394
01:58:49,987 --> 01:58:53,185
有些坚定性 这辈子取得了很大成就。
Yeah.

2395
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:53,042
<i>A little bit of decisiveness goes a long way in this life, all right?</i>

2396
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:54,628
- 无 - 是的。
Yeah. Great.

2397
01:58:55,153 --> 01:58:57,424
和工作怎么样了
<i>And what about work? How's that goin'?</i>

2398
01:58:58,528 --> 01:59:01,935
好吧。今天是 一个糟糕的一天。他错过了一个人。
Uh, I don't know. It's all right.

2399
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,169
Today kind of sucked. This guy didn't show up.

2400
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,731
但毫无疑问，它给 换个角度看人生。
But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world.

2401
01:59:06,256 --> 01:59:07,844
人是猪！
People are slobs.

2402
01:59:09,324 --> 01:59:13,295
当他们问你， 说“泥瓦匠做的非常好。”
<i>Well, when people ask me about you, I say to them,</i>

2403
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:16,287
“你有一份工作。清理一切。”
<i>"Mason, he's doing great.</i>

2404
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,370
<i>"He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up."</i>

2405
01:59:17,214 --> 01:59:19,967
打个招呼安妮和库珀。
<i>AH right, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you?</i>

2406
01:59:19,992 --> 01:59:23,256
问好你的大哥哥。 “你好，兄弟。”
<i>Say hi to your big brother. "Hey, big brother."</i>

2407
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:25,014
你好安妮。你好，朋友。
Hey, Annie. Hey, kiddo.

2408
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:26,126
说再见。
<i>Can you say bye-bye?</i>

2409
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,444
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

2410
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:29,692
再见。
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

2411
01:59:30,996 --> 01:59:33,047
开车时一定要小心。
<i>All right. Well, be careful when you're driving, all right?</i>

2412
01:59:33,072 --> 01:59:35,718
不要发短信什么的。
<i>Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. All right, just...</i>

2413
01:59:37,047 --> 01:59:41,480
您奥比万。 专注和耐心,,,,,,不是吗
<i>You're Obi-Wan. You're centered, patient. Right?</i>

2414
01:59:41,505 --> 01:59:43,771
三辆车关注 在前面，两个在后面。
<i>You watch three cars ahead, two behind.</i>

2415
01:59:43,796 --> 01:59:46,107
它有两个坏 导致发生事故。
<i>Takes two bad drivers to have an accident, okay?</i>

2416
01:59:47,413 --> 01:59:51,221
你告诉令妹， 拿起你的电话给我打电话。
Okay-

2417
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,361
<i>Listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something.</i>

2418
01:59:51,862 --> 01:59:54,775
- 好了，我的朋友。玩的很开心。 - 再见了，爸爸。
<i>Okay. All right, buddy.</i>

2419
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,122
You have a <i>good</i> one. Bye,Dad.

2420
01:59:57,552 --> 02:00:00,576
借此你姐姐。 把它放在卡车上。
Hey, honey, take this to your sister.

2421
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,930
Throw it in the truck, okay?

2422
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,764
Okay, I will.

2423
02:00:03,428 --> 02:00:06,320
- 在哪里希娜睡觉 - 与她的朋友艾米丽。
So where is Sheena staying?

2424
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,326
At her friend Emily's.

2425
02:00:07,022 --> 02:00:09,243
- 是否艾米莉 - 是的！
Is Emily a real person?

2426
02:00:09,626 --> 02:00:12,118
这是第三年。 他有他自己的公寓。
Yeah.

2427
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,764
Yeah, she's a sophomore. She has an apartment.

2428
02:00:15,283 --> 02:00:18,883
这是紧急情况。 不花钱的话，我想回去。
Okay, this is in case of emergency.

2429
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,724
Don't spend it, I want it back.

2430
02:00:19,608 --> 02:00:20,612
谢谢。
Okay. Thanks.

2431
02:00:22,039 --> 02:00:23,436
你做你的功课
Did you do your homework?

2432
02:00:23,461 --> 02:00:26,052
几乎所有的东西，但我会完成的明天。
Most of it, but I can finish tomorrow night.

2433
02:00:26,377 --> 02:00:29,689
大三的时候很 重要的UNI。不要搞砸了。
Honey, 11th grade is really important for college. Don't blow it.

2434
02:00:29,714 --> 02:00:32,673
我知道，我知道。 这就是我们要的UT。
I know, I know. I mean, we're going to UT and everything.

2435
02:00:32,933 --> 02:00:37,246
你难道不想去吗 “希娜，是什么 与妈妈“之旅承兑汽油。
Oh, don't you want me to come?

2436
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,609
"Come on, Sheena, road trip with Mom!" I'll pay for gas.

2437
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:37,806
Fine.

2438
02:00:39,519 --> 02:00:41,279
我在开玩笑。我有工作。
Just kidding. I have work.

2439
02:00:43,742 --> 02:00:45,871
- 叫我当你到达那里。 - 我会做。
Call me when you get there.

2440
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,606
I will.

2441
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:49,392
玩得开心！
Have fun!

2442
02:00:59,081 --> 02:01:02,630
听起来好像一个愿景 都非常简单。
That sounds to me like just another

2443
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,967
extreme Mason view of everything.

2444
02:01:02,969 --> 02:01:05,535
一点也不。最后，我得到了它。
Not at all! I finally figured it out.

2445
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,383
当他们意识到 这将是太贵了,,,
It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive

2446
02:01:08,408 --> 02:01:12,036
建立半机器人和机器人，
to actually build cyborgs and robots.

2447
02:01:12,845 --> 02:01:16,215
还是在成本 飞涨，他们决定人类,,,
I mean, the costs of that were impossible.

2448
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,444
They decided to just let humans

2449
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:18,082
自我改造成机器人。
turn themselves into robots.

2450
02:01:18,664 --> 02:01:21,050
- 这是发生了什么。 - 现在
That's what's going on right now.

2451
02:01:21,553 --> 02:01:26,618
为什么不呢有几十亿 我们在那里，什么都不做。
Oh, right now?

2452
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,561
Yeah! I mean, why not?

2453
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:26,043
They're billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything.

2454
02:01:28,026 --> 02:01:31,827
我们已经花费。 直到我们自我维护，
We don't cost anything.

2455
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:33,528
We're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly.

2456
02:01:32,352 --> 02:01:34,210
我们不断重现。
And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed

2457
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:37,358
正如我们所看到的，我们,,,

2458
02:01:37,682 --> 02:01:41,575
生物程序 成为半机器人。
for our little cyborg upgrades.

2459
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:42,601
- 作为 - 认真。
How? Seriously.

2460
02:01:42,626 --> 02:01:45,519
我读到一篇文章，有一天说,,,
I read this thing the other day about how...

2461
02:01:45,844 --> 02:01:48,415
当我们听到的声音 收件箱
When you hear that ding on your inbox,

2462
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:51,295
接受注射 多巴胺在大脑。
you get like a dopamine rush in your brain.

2463
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:55,722
好像我们化学奖励 为让它得到洗脑。
It's like we're being chemically rewarded

2464
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,926
for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed.

2465
02:01:56,435 --> 02:01:59,438
这不为恶我们搞砸了！
How evil is that? We're fucked.

2466
02:01:59,603 --> 02:02:02,469
你以为删除您 Facebook的页面会改变什么
So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that?

2467
02:02:02,504 --> 02:02:08,365
我记得当它做TRAVER 去年。每个人都嘲笑他。
Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year

2468
02:02:08,681 --> 02:02:10,813
你笑起来比任何人。
and everyone just hated him?

2469
02:02:10,838 --> 02:02:12,442
我一直在笑TRAVER。
You made more fun of him than anyone.

2470
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,609
I still make fun of Trevor though.

2471
02:02:14,427 --> 02:02:17,163
你需要注意的是可悲的。
It was like he was so pathetically desperate for attention.

2472
02:02:17,188 --> 02:02:19,171
或者是不同的，什么的。
Or to be different, or something.

2473
02:02:19,196 --> 02:02:22,803
并将其与愚蠢的故事结束 它在学校的报纸。
That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper.

2474
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:26,069
我不得不做出一个伟大的 广告，当他回到在随后的一个月。
And then he had to make a big announcement about it

2475
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:25,250
when he came back a month later.

2476
02:02:26,219 --> 02:02:28,544
但我不在乎。
That's the thing, though, I'm not doing it for attention.

2477
02:02:28,569 --> 02:02:31,928
我想试住 我的生活中没有的画面。
I just wanna try and not live my life through a screen.

2478
02:02:32,253 --> 02:02:35,022
我想一个真正的互动。
I want some kind of actual interaction.

2479
02:02:35,677 --> 02:02:39,532
一个真正的人。 任何资料在网上公布。
A real person, not just the profile they put up.

2480
02:02:39,745 --> 02:02:41,689
道歉。你到底在说什么
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying something?

2481
02:02:41,914 --> 02:02:44,107
没关系。 我知道你在开玩笑，但,,,
Yeah, okay, I know you're joking.

2482
02:02:44,132 --> 02:02:48,627
有一定的道理。您 国家与手机的整个行程。
But, I mean, it's kind of true.

2483
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,370
You have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time,

2484
02:02:48,652 --> 02:02:50,112
你做什么工作什么呢
so, what're you really doing?

2485
02:02:50,137 --> 02:02:53,186
如果你不关心他们做什么 上周六下午，朋友，
You don't care what your friends are up to on a Saturday afternoon,

2486
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:59,002
你不是沉浸 我深深的委屈，
but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching.

2487
02:02:59,027 --> 02:03:03,046
它似乎所有 他们是介于两者之间的地方。
So, yeah, it's like everyone's just stuck in like an in-between state.

2488
02:03:03,424 --> 02:03:05,568
如果没有经历严重的事情。
Not really experiencing anything.

2489
02:03:05,593 --> 02:03:07,920
它不是一个经验。
It's not an experience, it's just information.

2490
02:03:09,108 --> 02:03:10,191
米拉。例如:
Look. For example,

2491
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:13,642
我得到的地址 俱乐部，在那里我们见面。
I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later,

2492
02:03:13,667 --> 02:03:16,932
因此，我们不丧失 甸街道后。
so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight.

2493
02:03:16,957 --> 02:03:18,701
非常感谢你，Facebook的。
Thank you very much, Facebook.

2494
02:03:19,026 --> 02:03:21,112
我发了条给我妈。
And then I just texted my mom back.

2495
02:03:21,637 --> 02:03:23,239
革命！
Oh, that's groundbreaking.

2496
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:26,047
你有没有看到你55分钟。
She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes?

2497
02:03:29,156 --> 02:03:30,964
天啊！最重要,,,
Oh...

2498
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,367
Oh, my God, most importantly,

2499
02:03:30,989 --> 02:03:33,677
我被告知， 我们有一个小型猪。
Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig.

2500
02:03:38,187 --> 02:03:41,980
你说得对。这是,,, 这是一个非常可爱的小猪。
Okay, you're right. That is a really cute, tiny pig.

2501
02:03:42,743 --> 02:03:44,376
我们的生活可以继续。
Our lives can go on.

2502

2505
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,408
and,uh, she should let you in.

2506
02:03:59,133 --> 02:04:00,468
206室，对不对
It's Room 206, right? Awesome. Mmm.

2507
02:04:01,998 --> 02:04:05,520
- 但不要在那里过夜。 - 好吧。玩得开心。
It's not weird that we're staying there, is it?

2508
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,764
No, it's fine. Have fun.

2509
02:04:05,545 --> 02:04:06,617
谢谢。
Thank you.

2510
02:04:07,375 --> 02:04:09,251
多久你一起出去吗
How long have you guys been dating?

2511
02:04:09,476 --> 02:04:11,182
大约三个月。
About three months.

2512
02:04:12,186 --> 02:04:15,827
我们遇到了在一个聚会上都不错。
Yeah, we met at a party and it's been chill.

2513
02:04:16,152 --> 02:04:18,107
- 这似乎安静。 - 是的，就是这样。
Yeah, he seems cool. Yeah, he is.

2514
02:04:18,769 --> 02:04:21,117
- 它也去得克萨斯大学 - 是的。
- Does he go to UT, too? - Yeah.

2515
02:04:21,142 --> 02:04:22,276
你在学什么
What does he study?

2516
02:04:22,301 --> 02:04:27,317
历史和意大利,,, 作为二级学科。
He's studying history and Italian, I think, his minor, yeah.

2517
02:04:27,342 --> 02:04:29,585
想教
Does he wanna teach Italian?

2518
02:04:29,610 --> 02:04:32,584
我不知道。我认为他仍然想着。
I think he's still figuring stuff out.

2519
02:04:33,209 --> 02:04:35,706
他已经决定了。他很聪明。
Yeah. He'll figure it out.

2520
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,086
He's smart. Smart, yeah.

2521
02:04:35,731 --> 02:04:38,521
和你住的地方，当你来到这里
So, where are you thinking about living when you come here?

2522
02:04:38,546 --> 02:04:42,337
我不知道。 我们将着眼于公寓,,,
Um, I'm not really sure yet.

2523
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:42,170
We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow.

2524
02:04:42,362 --> 02:04:43,380
晨。
Um...

2525
02:04:44,572 --> 02:04:47,709
我的父母认为 我住在大学宿舍。
But I know my parents sort of were expecting me to live in a dorm.

2526
02:04:48,005 --> 02:04:50,797
不过，我将支付单，所以,,,
But I'm paying my way through college,

2527
02:04:50,822 --> 02:04:52,767
不那么重要了。
so it doesn't really matter that much.

2528
02:04:52,792 --> 02:04:55,489
你不必听什么 18后告诉你的父母。
You don't have to listen to your parents after you turn 18.

2529
02:04:55,514 --> 02:04:58,285
特别是，如果你不帮经济。
Especially if they're not helping you financially.

2530
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:00,439
这就是我的想法。
That's what I figured.

2531
02:05:01,037 --> 02:05:05,310
卧室也不错。 尤其是当它们混合。
But living in a dorm isn't so bad. Yeah?

2532
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,009
I mean, especially if it's a coed dorm.

2533
02:05:05,985 --> 02:05:10,185
我从来没有过 周围有那么多的帅哥。
Yeah.

2534
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:09,370
I mean, I've never been around so many cute guys at once.

2535
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:12,729
UNI是乐趣！
Like, college is really fun.

2536
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:16,701
- 我很兴奋。 - 这是很好的，是的。
I'm excited. It's great, yeah.

2537
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,481
Oh.

2538
02:05:38,187 --> 02:05:42,191
在我出生那天我就开始年龄

2539
02:05:42,216 --> 02:05:46,249
没有人告诉我，生命 我能够这么寂寞和残忍

2540
02:05:46,274 --> 02:05:49,681
他在23有灰白的头发

2541
02:05:49,706 --> 02:05:53,504
这样的生活 运气不好会跟我结束

2542
02:05:53,529 --> 02:05:59,096
老黑乌鸦 槽已经离开我的脸

2543
02:06:01,399 --> 02:06:06,801
而在旅途中 我在同一个地方

2544
02:06:06,826 --> 02:06:09,818
艰苦的生活会跟我结束

2545
02:06:29,506 --> 02:06:34,713
施工过程中的最新死亡 胡佛水坝是他的儿子，
The last death at the Hoover Dam construction site

2546
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:35,408
was his son, Patrick Tierney,

2547
02:06:34,938 --> 02:06:40,920
帕特里克・蒂尔尼， 谁死在1935年12月20日。
who died on December 20th, 1935,

2548
02:06:40,945 --> 02:06:43,691
短短13年后。
exactly 13 years to the day.

2549
02:06:44,216 --> 02:06:46,377
你看到了女孩的姐妹
See those sorority girls over there?

2550
02:06:49,866 --> 02:06:53,730
我已经决定了。如果您删除 Facebook的页面，我会推出我的。
I've just decided,

2551
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,521
if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging.

2552
02:06:55,186 --> 02:06:59,567
是的，在几年 这将是你,,,,,,那将是我的。
Yeah, in just a few years that's you,

2553
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,570
and that's gonna be me.

2554
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,406
...Inlaid into the terrazzo floors was a star map,

2555
02:07:02,795 --> 02:07:08,346
星图。一个地图 天体的准确,,,
a celestial map of heavenly bodies so accurately displayed

2556
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:13,842
可能绘制的位置 北极星14000年后,,,
that one could chart the procession of the pole star

2557
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,121
14,000 years into the future, such that future generations upon...

2558
02:07:13,867 --> 02:07:15,567
和后代,,,
I wonder what his deal is.

2559
02:07:15,663 --> 02:07:18,895
我不知道它做什么。 不来吃饭。
I mean, he obviously has money to eat here.

2560
02:07:19,605 --> 02:07:23,397
是的。他是在UT教授。 并与后投保。
He just said. He's a UT professor, tenure and everything.

2561
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:29,740
看看所有这些人。 你为什么在这里凌晨三点
Look at all these people.

2562
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,001
What're they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?

2563
02:07:29,765 --> 02:07:32,597
我们做什么 在凌晨三点
What are we even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?

2564
02:07:32,622 --> 02:07:34,190
你知道为什么我们在这里
We know what we're doing here.

2565
02:07:34,215 --> 02:07:36,369
奶酪！我们有一个目的。
Queso. We have a purpose.

2566
02:07:37,594 --> 02:07:39,016
右。
Hell, yeah.

2567
02:07:41,338 --> 02:07:44,546
在明年夏天， 等会我们的生活。
You know, by next summer, this'll just be our lives.

2568
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,846
Mmm.

2569
02:07:46,836 --> 02:07:49,469
熬夜。视图显示。
Staying out all night, going to shows, whatever we want.

2570
02:07:50,772 --> 02:07:51,772
我们想要的东西。
We ever gonna go to class?

2571
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:54,204
你还课
Sometimes.

2572
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,979
- 几乎每。 - 听起来不错。
When it feels right. When the inspiration hits.

2573
02:07:58,995 --> 02:08:01,612
- 直到灵感闪现。 - 仅在所述时间。
Only then.

2574
02:08:03,726 --> 02:08:06,047
- 还要别的吗 - 更多的奶酪
Anything else?

2575
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,801
<i>Uh, more queso? Yeah.</i>

2576
02:08:13,863 --> 02:08:17,493
- 神,,, - 什么
Jesus.

2577
02:08:17,518 --> 02:08:20,937
是不是有点势不可挡
What?

2578
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,126
I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming?

2579
02:08:21,476 --> 02:08:22,612
这所大学,,,,,,
I mean, college?

2580
02:08:23,692 --> 02:08:26,413
我喜欢这个主意 远离家乡，和,,,
I mean, I like the idea of being away from home

2581
02:08:26,438 --> 02:08:29,562
获取知识 并提高我的照片，但它是,,,
and gaining skills and getting better at photography.

2582
02:08:30,410 --> 02:08:34,779
我不认为这是 变革。
I just...

2583
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,731
I don't know, I'm not counting on it

2584
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:33,883
being some big, transformative experience.

2585
02:08:34,804 --> 02:08:38,658
不要认为这是为变革。 这只是在下一个步骤。
I don't think it's that transformative.

2586
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,008
I just see it as the next step.

2587
02:08:38,683 --> 02:08:43,465
这就像一个预先设定的空间 你已经有你的姓名和电话号码。
But it's like a preordained slot

2588
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,963
that's already got your name and number on it.

2589
02:08:44,407 --> 02:08:46,574
不要以为这是关键到我的未来。
I don't think it's the key to my future.

2590
02:08:46,599 --> 02:08:48,534
看看我的妈妈。
'Cause, I mean, look at my mom.

2591

他毕业后找到了一份工作。
She got her degree and got a pretty good job.

2592
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:54,816
- 支付帐单,,, - 我喜欢你的妈妈。
She can pay her bills.

2593
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,244
I like your mom.

2594
02:08:55,721 --> 02:08:57,947
我也是，但我的意思是,,,
I like my mom, too. I just mean...

2595
02:08:58,619 --> 02:09:01,748
在背景中， 她的困惑我。
Basically she's still just as fuckin' confused as I am.

2596

2621
02:11:47,085 --> 02:11:48,864
在这个夏天，我想。
Yeah. When you gonna go out there?

2622
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:47,769
End of the summer, I think.

2623
02:11:48,889 --> 02:11:53,210
我将努力早一点。 我想节省一些钱。
Work some more before then, try to save up some money, at least.

兴奋。 一半兴奋，一半害怕。
Excited, you know.

2628
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:02,327
But kind of half-excited, half-terrified.

2629
02:12:03,486 --> 02:12:06,612
- 这妖娆的恐慌。 - 这是正确的。
Yeah, kind of that voluptuous panic.

2630
02:12:06,934 --> 02:12:09,630
这将是很好的。这将是伟大的为您服务。
Yeah. Exactly.

2631
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,811
Well, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be crazy good.

2632
02:12:09,746 --> 02:12:12,053
对我来说，我喜欢单 比高中得多。
I liked college a lot better than high school.

You kinda find your people in college, you know?

你会没事的。有一个好 心脏。听你的心脏。

02:12:33,644 --> 02:12:36,162
- 你看，三种。什么 - 我不能，明天见。
I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish.

2640
02:12:36,187 --> 02:12:38,422
我不明白为什么 你表现得像个孩子。
I'm not being childish!

2641
02:12:38,447 --> 02:12:42,638
事实并非如此。你成为了一个 有大事要告诉大家。
You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone!

2642
02:12:42,663 --> 02:12:43,924
我没有告诉任何人。
I haven't told anyone.

2643
02:12:43,949 --> 02:12:47,005
你怎么知道Cynthy 你去参加派对了一个失败者，
So Cynthia just magically knows

2644
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:48,918
尽管没有看到他
you're going to the prom with this loser,

2645
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,610
even though you're not dating him anymore?

- 他是我最好的朋友。 - 你最好的朋友有一个大嘴巴。
She's my best friend.

与她商量一下，然后。
Take it up with her, then.

2649
02:12:54,410 --> 02:12:56,779
你为什么不告诉 这是罗伯特・托什
Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw

2650

she can keep on talking,

2651

而包括真相

which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation

2653
02:13:02,446 --> 02:13:05,340
如果你的男朋友是不是单 超出这个周末。
if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend.

你已经买了票。
You had already bought the tickets.

2655
02:13:08,833 --> 02:13:12,168
不要紧。 我只是想表示友好。
It's just prom, it's not like it matters.

2656
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,045
I'm just trying to be friends with you.

2657
02:13:12,193 --> 02:13:15,576
这是一个耻辱。我不能做到这一点。
It's just humiliating. I can't do that.

2658
02:13:16,261 --> 02:13:18,820
先生:“我不关心 别人怎么想我的。 “
Mister I-Don't-Care- What-Anyone-Else- Thinks-Of-Me.

2659
02:13:18,845 --> 02:13:23,349
他妈的说。我在乎的是什么 我觉得对我来说，这没什么大不了的。
Fuck anyone else!

2660
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:23,364
I care what I think of me, which isn't much right now.

2661
02:13:24,847 --> 02:13:26,678
可惜了党的国王。
King of the Pity Prom.

2662

好了，我们不会。
Fine. We're not going.

2663
02:13:30,125 --> 02:13:31,003
太棒了。
Great.

2664
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,229
我们是什么,,,
Why are we even...

2665
02:13:46,891 --> 02:13:50,390
我们知道这是未来。 我是一个谁做了这件事的东西。
I mean, we both knew this was coming.

2666
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,528
I'm just the one who did something about it.

2667
02:13:50,415 --> 02:13:53,101
- 是的，你从性交单的家伙。 - 你他妈的！
Yeah, fucking some college guy.

2668
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,446

- 我不后悔任何事情。 - 当然不是。
I don't regret anything.

2670
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,964
Of course you don't.

2671
02:13:57,872 --> 02:14:02,641
这是一种解脱，是与人 谁没有按下的所有时间。
You know, it's actually kind of a relief

2672
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:01,560
not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time.

2673
02:14:03,698 --> 02:14:07,378
世界上没有那么可怕。 并非一切都是一个很大的阴谋。
The world's not so horrible.

2674
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:06,770
Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.

2675
02:14:07,502 --> 02:14:09,349
我很高兴你能这么想。
It's great that you can think that way.

2676
02:14:09,674 --> 02:14:14,370
当然约会运动员 可以帮助你,,,,,,清除你的头脑。
You know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind.

2677
02:14:15,171 --> 02:14:18,379
这不是一个运动员。 只有在曲棍球队。
He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team.

2678
02:14:18,861 --> 02:14:21,264
我们将在大学 不同的明年。

它不是这样一个严肃的关系。
It's not some super-serious relationship.

2680

太好了！现在我感觉好多了。

02:14:30,333 --> 02:14:31,658
马都拉，梅森。
Grow up, Mason.

2684
02:14:34,009 --> 02:14:36,206
我不是一个人了。
It's not like I haven't been with anyone else.

你在乎什么
What do you care?

- 是谁 - 谁在乎
Who?

2688
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,161
Does it matter?

2689
02:14:45,596 --> 02:14:47,195
您提出来的。
You're the one who brought it up.

2690
02:14:53,495 --> 02:14:54,767
这是没有意义的。
This is pointless.

2691
02:14:55,692 --> 02:14:58,104
现在，你正在玩的傻瓜。
Now you're just trying to be an asshole.

2692

他妈的！我宁愿 把我的球,,,
Holy crap, I would rather have my balls clawed off

2693
02:15:05,911 --> 02:15:08,223
而不必 再忍受这样的事情。

Well, you never, ever have to.

2695

2916
02:25:06,716 --> 02:25:09,843
你必须找到一种方法 你从包中分离出来。
You just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way.

2917
02:25:09,868 --> 02:25:11,601
你擅长什么，你知道吗
Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter

2918
02:25:11,626 --> 02:25:14,913
在那里你可以选择你想要的 牛群当你前进,,,
when the front-runner hussies start sniffing around.

2919
02:25:14,938 --> 02:25:16,102
开始嗅探。
So what you're saying is I should take up lacrosse.

2920
02:25:16,127 --> 02:25:19,040
所以我应该献身于曲棍球。
Exactly.

2921
02:25:19,065 --> 02:25:20,313
右。
Or you could, you know, start a band.

2922
02:25:20,538 --> 02:25:22,626
,,,,,,形成一个摇滚乐队。
Worked for me a long time ago. I think it's still working for Jimmy.

2923
02:25:22,651 --> 02:25:24,371
它早就为我工作

2924
02:25:24,696 --> 02:25:26,756
它仍然起作用吉米。
Or you just keep taking pictures.

2925
02:25:27,383 --> 02:25:29,227
还在拍照。
She hated the pictures I took of her.

2926
02:25:29,747 --> 02:25:31,870
她恨我把他的照片。
I'm sick to death of her, okay?

2927
02:25:32,073 --> 02:25:33,770
我烦死了。
I only met her a few times, and yes, she was cute, all right,

2928
02:25:33,795 --> 02:25:36,200
我只看到一对夫妇 时间，是的，它很可爱。

2929
02:25:36,525 --> 02:25:39,582
但事实上， 我一直认为这是一个有点,,,
but truth be told, I always thought she was a little bit...

2930
02:25:40,239 --> 02:25:42,368
有点无聊你。
You know, a little bit too square for you.

2931
02:25:42,393 --> 02:25:44,280
它们不是在同一波长。
You know, not quite the same vibe.

2932
02:25:44,651 --> 02:25:46,027
你知道发生了什么给我
You really thought that?

2933
02:25:46,052 --> 02:25:47,892
他是在一个较低的水平。
On some subtle, lower level.

2934
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,522
I mean, I wasn't surprised

2935
02:25:50,068 --> 02:25:54,632
我并不感到惊讶， 有兴趣的曲棍球婴儿。
when it turned out she was interested in some Knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?

2936
02:25:56,968 --> 02:26:00,057
基本上，这一切都取决于 时间在这些事情上。
I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things, you know.

2937
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:03,770
看看我和你妈妈。
I mean, take your mom and me.

2938
02:26:03,795 --> 02:26:05,918
我想我已经成为,,,
I think I probably turned into the boring,

2939
02:26:05,943 --> 02:26:09,758
镗绝育 她想15-20年前。
castrated guy she wanted me to be

2940
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,602
15, 20 years ago, you know?

2941
02:26:10,348 --> 02:26:12,665
我不是说他错了会生气的。
I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed, I'm not.

2942
02:26:12,690 --> 02:26:15,366
我只是说，它可以 已经有点耐心。
I'm just saying that she could've been

2943
02:26:15,715 --> 02:26:16,927
多一点宽容。
a little more patient, little more forgiving.

2944
02:26:16,952 --> 02:26:19,832
我会救 醉酒白痴的游行。
Would've saved me that parade of drunken assholes.

2945
02:26:28,743 --> 02:26:29,959
有什么意义
So, what's the point?

2946
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:32,602
什么
Of What?

2947
02:26:33,665 --> 02:26:35,987
我不知道。这。一切。
I don't know, any of this. Everything.

2948
02:26:37,272 --> 02:26:38,376
一切吗
Everything? What's the point?

2949
02:26:39,387 --> 02:26:42,235
有什么意义 什么他妈的我知道吗
I mean, I sure as shit don't know.

2950
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:46,066
没有一个知道这是为什么。全部,,,
Neither does anybody else, okay?

2951
02:26:46,091 --> 02:26:50,116
即兴发挥，你知道吗 好事是，你觉得东西。
We're all just winging it, you know?

2952
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,809
The good news is you're feeling stuff.

2953
02:26:51,078 --> 02:26:52,823
你必须坚持这一点。
And you've got to hold on to that.

2954
02:26:53,948 --> 02:26:57,579
你长大了，不觉得多。 皮肤变得坚硬。
You do. I mean, you get older and you don't feel as much.

2955
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,124
Your skin gets tougher.

2956
02:26:57,979 --> 02:26:59,774
你的感觉是对的照片。
The point is those pictures you took,

2957
02:26:59,799 --> 02:27:02,805
他们把照片 全州，你赢了。
thousands of submissions from all over the state, and you won.

2958
02:27:04,158 --> 02:27:05,414
我赢得了银牌。
Well, I got silver.

2959
02:27:06,418 --> 02:27:07,663
与人相处。
And nine other people did, too. I'm gonna kill you.

2960
02:27:07,688 --> 02:27:10,871
我想说的是，我相信你，梅森。
I'm trying to tell you that I believe in you, Mason.

2961
02:27:10,896 --> 02:27:14,791
我觉得你很特别。如果你 女孩看不出来，他妈的。
I think you're really special,

2962
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:13,567
and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, you know.

2963
02:27:16,651 --> 02:27:19,540
这个问题是专门 一个年轻的礼物。
Hey, this next one of 'em goes out to a young man in the house.

2964
02:27:20,365 --> 02:27:22,629
我见到他时，我还是个孩子。
Whoo-hoo! Known him since he was just a small boy.

2965
02:27:23,054 --> 02:27:27,646
现在学完了 二，让我觉得自己老了。
Now he's all graduated from high school and making me feel old.

2966
02:27:29,371 --> 02:27:31,305
你毕业了，梅森。
Happy high school graduation, Mason.

2967

谢谢。
Thank you.

2968
02:28:01,158 --> 02:28:04,935
打抱不平。 将有四大类。
Okay, guys, let's be clear. We're gonna break this into four categories.

A:有什么 谁想要随身携带的童年。
One, anything you want to keep from your childhood

四:我们想尝试什么 卖在展会这个周末。
at the garage sale next weekend,

2974
02:28:16,291 --> 02:28:18,995
什么是不卖将捐献。
whatever we don't sell, we're donating.

2975
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:23,296
请问公寓没有 阁楼，储藏的东西
Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?

2976
02:28:23,723 --> 02:28:26,057
不，你不明白。
No. You're missing the point.

2977
02:28:26,082 --> 02:28:29,416
我们不会采取废话 老我的小公寓。
We're not gonna drag a bunch of crap to Mom's tiny apartment.

2978
02:28:30,039 --> 02:28:31,955
另一个举动，简直不敢相信。
Can't believe we're moving again.

2979
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:36,142
我谨动议。你喜欢在两年前提出的。 在奥斯汀的一间公寓。
No, I'm moving.

2980
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,005

2981
02:28:36,368 --> 02:28:38,120
梅森移动在秋季。
Mason is moving in the fall.

2982
02:28:38,645 --> 02:28:39,685
我完成了！
I'm done.

2983
02:28:40,026 --> 02:28:44,234
这将是巨大的。我有很多选择。 我，我可以采取休假。
This'll be great for me. I'll have all these options.

2984
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,170
I could take a sabbatical.

2985
02:28:44,259 --> 02:28:46,987
我可以献身于写作。 获取出版了我。
I could get some writing done, try to get published.

2986
02:28:47,012 --> 02:28:49,175
什么圣诞节 我们该怎么办
What about Christmas, though? What are we gonna do?

2987
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:50,835
我不会共用一个房间跟他。
I'm not sharing a room with him.

2988
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:54,369
其中，你会睡在沙发上。 我们将使用充气垫。
One of you will sleep on the couch,

2989
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,688
and we'll use that blow-up mattress.

2990
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:57,349
而如何洗我的衣服吗
How am I supposed to do my laundry?

2991
02:28:58,257 --> 02:29:01,306
我给人一种 轻推离巢。
Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest.

2992
02:29:01,631 --> 02:29:05,913
也许奇迹般地下降 找一些硬币,,,
And on your way down, you may magically find some quarters

2993
02:29:05,938 --> 02:29:08,393
洗衣服 在自己的公寓。
that you use to do laundry in your own apartment.

2994
02:29:09,253 --> 02:29:12,461
但请！你是,,,大人。
Come on! You guys are adults!

2995
02:29:12,486 --> 02:29:14,678
他们必须承担责任。
You need to take some responsibility. Now, what do you want?

2996
02:29:15,622 --> 02:29:16,814
他们想要什么
I'm gonna get the veggie burger.

2997
02:29:17,805 --> 02:29:19,757
í的素食汉堡。
I'm not having anything, not hungry.

2998
02:29:20,298 --> 02:29:22,576
没有我。我不饿。
What's wrong with you?

2999
02:29:23,103 --> 02:29:24,380
怎么了
I'm sick.

3000
02:29:25,235 --> 02:29:26,755
我心情不好。
What is it, your head? Do you have a fever?

3001

你有什么请问头你有没有发烧
She's pregnant.

3002
02:29:30,265 --> 02:29:31,706
你怀孕了。
No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night.

3003
02:29:33,603 --> 02:29:36,858
事实上，我喝多了昨晚。
You weren't driving, were you? No, no.

3004
02:29:36,883 --> 02:29:39,228
- 有开车，对不对 - 不，不。
Cary's back home, too, and we just hung out.

3005
02:29:39,553 --> 02:29:42,485
嘉莉又回来了。 在共同度过。
You know, peach Smirnoff s, they just go down so easy.

3006

- 杰克丹尼尔下来喝了点酒,,, - 不，不。
No, no. Hey, that's not an excuse.

3007
02:29:47,807 --> 02:29:49,262
没有任何借口。
You can still pack boxes.

3008
02:29:49,287 --> 02:29:53,374
就像你可以填写框。人 要移动尽可能快。
These people want to move in as soon as possible.

3009
02:29:54,190 --> 02:29:55,119
你好。
Hi, guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you?

3010
02:29:55,144 --> 02:29:56,107
Ernesto'm Larrio。
You probably don't remember me,

3011
02:29:57,307 --> 02:29:59,411
她不记得我，但是,,,
but I worked on your septic line years ago.

3012
02:29:59,436 --> 02:30:01,635
我管了几年前。
Oh, yeah.

3013
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:02,924
右。
Believe it or not, you changed my life.

3014
02:30:03,293 --> 02:30:05,356
不管你信不信，它改变了我的生活。
You told me that day that I was smart

3015
02:30:05,807 --> 02:30:09,290
我说我是 智能化，不得不去单。
and that I should go to school.

3016
02:30:10,165 --> 02:30:11,498
我把他的意见。
I took your advice. I signed up for English classes,

3017
02:30:11,523 --> 02:30:13,066
先用英语班。
and then a year later, I went to community college

3018
02:30:13,091 --> 02:30:16,373
一年后，我上了大学 社区和管理的大专学历。
and I got my Associates degree,

3019
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:18,862
现在，我在UNI 执照后的状态。
and I'm working on my bachelor's now at Texas State.

3020
02:30:18,987 --> 02:30:20,385
我在这里有一个经理。
And also one of the managers here.

3021
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:21,363
辣妹！
That's great.

3022
02:30:22,423 --> 02:30:26,337
很高兴看到它，并有 这个机会向他们表示感谢。
It's good to see you, because I really wanted

3023
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,926
a chance to thank you for that.

3024
02:30:28,043 --> 02:30:29,578
这是一个大问题，对我来说。
Gracias. It really meant a lot to me.

3025
02:30:30,469 --> 02:30:32,463
午餐是在我身上。
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do.

3026
02:30:32,488 --> 02:30:34,287
- 这是我至少可以做到。 - 谢谢。
You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.

3027
02:30:34,312 --> 02:30:37,236
让她如此。这是一个聪明的女人。

3028
02:30:38,404 --> 02:30:39,408
谢谢。
Thank you.

3029
02:30:53,883 --> 02:30:57,016
是不是疯了 计算机知道你是谁,,,
Isn't that kind of crazy, though,

3030
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,730
that a computer knows who you are

3031
02:30:57,041 --> 02:30:59,369
20题在窗体上。
from just 20 questions off a form?

3032
02:30:59,394 --> 02:31:02,577
似乎有只 世界各地的八类人。
I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world.

3033
02:31:02,602 --> 02:31:05,544
有子集 由于男性和女性，但是,,,
I mean, there are subsets like male and female,

3034
02:31:05,569 --> 02:31:08,558
显然，我们不 作为独一无二的，因为我们的想法。
but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are.

3035
02:31:08,583 --> 02:31:10,895
你有没有跟他谈过
Have you even talked to this guy yet?

3036
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:13,349
没有，但我们交换的消息。
No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool.

3037
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:16,355
它看起来不错。文学研究,,,
He's studying literature and anthropology

3038
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:20,852
和人类学，并爱 明亮的眼睛，这是一件好事。
and he's way into Bright Eyes, so that's not so bad.

3039
02:31:20,877 --> 02:31:23,343
他告诉我说,,,
But, anyways, he was telling me about how

3040
02:31:23,368 --> 02:31:26,659
该系统分配对等体 卧室给人有点吓人。
the system they use for assigning roommates is kinda spooky.

3041
02:31:27,297 --> 02:31:31,307
书呆子的满意率 与以前是60％对等体。
The freshman satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%,

3042
02:31:31,332 --> 02:31:32,549
而现在是100％。
and now it's 100, just 'cause of the computer.

3043
02:31:33,209 --> 02:31:34,766
仅由计算机。
Well, sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then.

3044
02:31:36,103 --> 02:31:37,920
这将是一个很好的伴侣，那么。
Yeah. But we pretty much decided

3045
02:31:38,803 --> 02:31:41,361
但是，我们得出这样的结论,,,,,,
that soon they won't even need a questionnaire

3046
02:31:41,386 --> 02:31:43,596
很快就不用了问卷。
