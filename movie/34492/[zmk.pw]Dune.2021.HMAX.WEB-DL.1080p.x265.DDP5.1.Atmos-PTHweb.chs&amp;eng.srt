1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,900
梦是来自内心深处的信息

2
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,837
每当太阳低垂斜照沙漠之时 我的故乡
My planet, Arrakis, is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

3
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,300
厄拉科斯星球分外美丽
Rolling over the sands…

4
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:08,220
空气中漂浮着香料
You can see spice in the air.

5
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,360
夜幕降临 香料机车登陆
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

6
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:30,617
为避开白昼炽热 异星人争分夺秒采集
The outsiders race against time
to avoid the heat of the day.

7
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:43,546
我亲眼见证了他们怎样践踏我们的家园
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

8
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:47,216
我知道了一切他们怎样蹂躏我们的同胞
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

9
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:56,600
我出生很久以前 这些异星人 哈克南家族就来到这里
These outsiders, The Harkonnens,
came long before I was born.

10
00:01:56,768 --> 00:02:00,396
通过控制香料生产 他们变得非常富有
By controlling the spice production
they became obscenely rich.

11
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:03,232
富可敌国
Richer than the Emperor himself.

12
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,568
我们的战士无法从哈克南人手中解放厄拉科斯
Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis
from the Harkonnens,

13
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:52,948
突然一天 皇帝下令 他们走了
but one day, by imperial decree,
they were gone.

14
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:06,128
为什么皇帝选择此道 谁是我们新的征服者
Why did the Emperor choose this path?
And who our next oppressors be?

15
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:43,872
10191年

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,172
厄崔迪家族的卡拉丹城堡

17
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,097
你早起真好
It's good you're up early.

18
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:03,725
父亲要你在帝国传令官抵达之前穿好正装
Father wants you in full dress
before the Emperor's herald arrives.

19
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,606
正装 军装吗
Full dress? Military?

20
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,024
礼服
Ceremonial.

21
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:14,944
已经决定之事 为何还要过场
Why do we have to go through all of this
when it's already been decided?

22
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:16,488
礼仪
Ceremony.

23
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:20,867
谢谢
Thank you.

24
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:24,454
如果你想要 就让我给你
If you want it make me give it to you.

25
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:29,334
- 用音言 - 妈妈 我刚睡醒
-Use the Voice.
-Mom, I just woke up.

26
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:40,845
- 把水给我 - 杯子听不见 你得命令我
-Give me the water.
-The glass can't hear you. Command me.

27
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,041
把水给我
Give me the water.

28
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,263
- 差一点 - 差一点
-Almost.
-Almost?

29
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:28,976
保罗 贝尼·杰瑟里特的技能需要苦学多年
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

30
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:32,604
你看来很累 又做梦了吗
You look tired. More dreams?

31
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,987
没有
No.

32
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:46,201
极端高温和恶劣气候
Extreme temperatures
and treacherous weather events

33
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:49,954
使厄拉科斯城外的生活无比艰难
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile.

34
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:53,750
沙暴之力足以断金
With sandstorms powerful enough
to cut through the metal.

35
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:59,589
唯有被称为弗雷曼的土著部落能够适应并生存下来
Only the native tribes known as the Fremen
have adapted well enough to survive.

36
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:04,677
弗雷曼人宁愿居住在厄拉科斯最偏远的地区
Preferring to inhabit
the remotest regions of Arrakis

37
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:08,348
与被弗雷曼人称为夏胡鲁的巨大沙虫
the Fremen share the deep desert
with the giant sandworms

38
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:11,517
共享这片沙漠腹地
known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud.

39
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:17,190
长期接触香料使部落有了他们独特的蓝眼睛
Long exposure to spice has given
the tribe their characteristic blue eyes,

40
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:19,442
“伊巴德之眼”
the eyes of Ibad.

41
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:22,153
弗雷曼人凶狠狡诈
Little else is known of the Fremen,

42
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,364
外界对他们所知甚少
except that they are dangerous
and unreliable.

43
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:31,453
弗雷曼人的袭击使得采集香料极其危险
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting
extremely hazardous.

44
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:35,082
对弗雷曼人而言 香料是神圣的迷幻剂
For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen

45
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:38,919
不仅维持生命 而且有益健康
which preserves life and brings
enormous health benefits.

46
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:45,134
对于帝国 宇航公会的领航员用这种香料
For the Imperium, the spice is used
by the navigators of the Spacing Guild

47
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:48,011
来寻找星际之间的安全通道
to find safe paths between the stars.

48
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:52,349
没有香料就没有星际航行
Without spice
interstellar travel is impossible,

49
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:56,853
这使它成为宇宙中最宝贵的物质
making it by far the most valuable
substance in the universe.

50
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:48,237
笑一笑 哥尼
Smile, Gurney.

51
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:50,323
我在笑
I am smiling.

52
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,870
他们远道而来办这个仪式要花多少钱
How much will it cost them traveling
all this way for this formality?

53
00:07:56,074 --> 00:08:01,584
三名公会领航员 来回一共1,460,062索拉里斯
Three Guild navigators and a total
of 1,460,062 solaris for the round trip.

54
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:20,018
承蒙皇帝沙达姆·科里诺四世
By the grace of Shaddam IV
of the House Corrino,

55
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:24,815
登上已知宇宙帕迪沙皇帝的金狮宝座的恩典
Ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne
of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe,

56
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:28,193
我作为星变使者前来宣旨
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

57
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,322
见证人有帝国宫廷成员
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

58
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:38,703
宇航公会代表 和贝尼·杰瑟里特姐妹
representatives of the Spacing Guild,
and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

59
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,665
皇上有旨
The Emperor has spoken:

60
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,806
“厄崔迪家族即刻接管厄拉科斯
"House Atreides shall immediately
take control of Arrakis

61
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:51,049
并永葆泰安”
and serve as its steward."

62
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:55,219
请接旨
Do you accept?

63
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,021
我们厄崔迪家族
We are the House Atreides.

64
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:10,860
永远忠诚 永不背叛
There is no call we do not answer.
There is no faith that we betray.

65
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:15,865
皇帝命令我们为厄拉科斯带去和平
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

66
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:19,076
厄崔迪家族接旨
House Atreides accepts.

67
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:24,248
厄崔迪
Atreides!

68
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,010
你的封印
Your seal.

69
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,505
这就 完成了
So, it's done?

70
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:18,217
完成了
It's done.

71
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,496
- 怎么样? - 稳定器太松了
-How was it?
-The stabilizers are too loose.

72
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:50,124
- 我来搞定 - 谢谢你 我的朋友
-I'll handle that.
-Thank you, my friend.

73
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,376
- 邓肯 - 好小子
-Duncan.
-My boy!

74
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:57,089
保罗 好小子
Paul, my boy.

75
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,386
那么 你明天和先遣队一起去厄拉科斯
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow
with the advance team?

76
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:04,137
是的 我明天和先遣队一起去厄拉科斯
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow
with the advance team.

77
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,726
- 我想和你一起去 - 真的
-I'd like you to take me with you.
-You would?

78
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:12,521
那太糟糕了 因为不行
That's too bad, cause no.

79
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,231
邓肯
Duncan…

80
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:18,777
你想害我上军事法庭吗 怎么了
Are you trying to give me court-martial?
What's going on?

81
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,697
- 我能跟你说个秘密吗  - 当然 你懂的
-Can I trust you with something?
-Always. You know that.

82
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,497
我最近经常做梦
I've been having dreams.

83
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:34,918
梦到厄拉科斯星球和弗雷曼人
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

84
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:46,304
好吧 那又怎样
Okay, so?

85
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:48,931
我看见你了
I saw you.

86
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,853
和弗雷曼人一起
With the Fremen.

87
00:11:56,648 --> 00:12:01,110
那么我真的找到他们了 你真棒 这是个好兆头 对吧
So I do find them? There you go.
That's a good omen right there, right?

88
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,781
兰维尔
Lanville!

89
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:14,707
我看见你倒下 战死沙场
I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle.

90
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:20,879
如果我在 你不会死
I felt like if I had been there
you'd be alive.

91
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,626
首先 我不会死
First of, I'm not gonna die.

92
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:29,969
- 我是认真的 - 所以你才想跟我一起去
-You're not taking me seriously.
-That's why you wanna come with me?

93
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:33,183
听着 梦境虽美却是海市蜃楼
Listen, dreams make good stories,

94
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:36,050
若要美梦成真
but everything important
happens when we're awake,

95
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,155
你得从梦中醒来
because that's where
we make things happen.

96
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:41,400
- 看看你 长肌肉了吗 - 我有吗
-Look at you, put up some muscle?
-I did?

97
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,818
没有
No.

98
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:49,950
厄拉科斯见 好小子
See you in Arrakis, my boy.

99
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:26,538
父亲 我请求明天和邓肯·爱达荷
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

100
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,613
一起去厄拉科斯侦察
on a scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow.

101
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,454
我学过弗雷曼语 我可以胜任
I've studied the Fremen language.
I'd be an asset.

102
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,710
不可能
Out of the question.

103
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,308
你将和我们其他人一起 在几周后去厄拉科斯
You'll travel in a few weeks
to Arrakis like the rest of us.

104
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:38,368
我一直都在训练 不让去有何意义
I've been training my whole life…
What is the point if I'm not allowed--

105
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:43,127
你知道为什么 保罗 你是厄崔迪家族的未来
You know why, Paul.
You're the future of the House Atreides.

106
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:45,421
祖父还可以玩斗牛呢
And grandfather fought bulls for sport.

107
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:48,924
是的 看看他的下场
Yes, look where that got him.

108
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:58,684
我需要你在我身边 我们去到厄拉科斯将面对重重危险
I need you by my side. When we get
to Arrakis we'll face enormous danger.

109
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:02,396
什么危险 弗雷曼人 沙漠
What danger? The Fremen? The desert?

110
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:05,732
政治危机
Political danger.

111
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:11,697
望族都指望我们来领导 这威胁到了皇帝
The great houses look to us for leadership
and this threatens the Emperor.

112
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:15,158
他把厄拉科斯从哈克南家族手中夺走 交给我们
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens
and making it ours

113
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:19,705
是要挑起一场战争 让两大家族自相残杀
he sets the stage for a war
which would weaken both houses.

114
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:24,960
但如果我们坚定不移地汲取厄拉科斯的真正力量
But if we hold firm
and tap the true power of Arrakis

115
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:27,379
我们将空前强大
we could be stronger than ever.

116
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:28,690
这什么意思
What does that mean?

117
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:31,710
采集香料 继续奴役弗里曼人吗
Mining spice, keeping
the Fremen in their place?

118
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,221
我们不会比哈克南人好到哪里去
We'd be no better than Harkonnens.

119
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,221
不 通过和弗雷曼人结盟
No. By making an alliance with the Fremen.

120
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,851
这就是我派邓肯·爱达荷去做的
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

121
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,856
在这里 在卡拉丹 我们用空中力量和海上力量来统治
Here, on Caladan, we've ruled
by air power and sea power.

122
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:49,818
在厄拉科斯 我们必须借助沙漠的力量
On Arrakis, we need to cultivate
desert power.

123
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:56,032
我想让你加入我的委员会 了解我的工作
I want you sitting in
on my council, learn what I do.

124
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,743
如果我不是呢 爸爸
What if I'm not, dad?

125
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:02,413
不是什么
Not what?

126
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,000
厄崔迪家族的未来
The future of the House Atreides.

127
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:21,098
我也曾告诉我父亲我不想要这个
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

128
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:28,230
- 我想当飞行员 - 你从没告诉过我
-I wanted to be a pilot.
-You never told me that.

129
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:35,779
你爷爷说 “伟大之人 不求领导
Your grandfather said, "A great
man doesn't seek to lead.

130
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:40,576
时事造就 应运而生”
He's called to it. And he answers."

131
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,578
但如果你并不愿意
And if your answer is "no"

132
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,544
我也希望你知道
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be,

133
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:54,131
你依然是我的儿子
my son.

134
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:07,852
我找到了我的道路 我相信你也会找到
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

135
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,648
为了列祖列宗
In their memory…

136
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:17,945
试试吧
give it a try.

137
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:28,957
不要背对门站着
Don't stand with your back to the door.

138
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:31,584
告诉你多少次
How many times do we have to tell you?

139
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,106
我从脚步声听出是你 哥尼·哈勒克
I could tell it was you
by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

140
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,211
有人可能模仿我的步伐
Someone might imitate my stride.

141
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:39,918
我分辨得出 你是新武器大师吗
I know the difference.
Are you the new weapons master?

142
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:43,259
邓肯·爱达荷不在了 我必须竭尽所能
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best as I can.

143
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:45,581
选择你的刀
Choose your blade.

144
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:50,144
我今天过得不错 哥尼 给我们唱首歌吧
I've had quite a day, Gurney.
Give us a song instead.

145
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:56,859
鲁莽
That's rude.

146
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:16,003
快点 快点
Come on. Come on.

147
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,130
老家伙
Old man.

148
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,226
这么慢的速度能刺穿你的屏蔽场
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

149
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:42,612
- 我猜我今天没心情 - 心情 这跟心情有毛关系
-I'm guessing I'm not in the mood today.
-Mood? What's mood got to do with it?

150
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,366
不管心情如何 都必须战斗 现在 战斗
You fight when the necessity arises,
no matter the mood. Now, fight!

151
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:54,540
来吧
Come on!

152
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:09,180
- 你输了 - 是吗
-I have you.
-Aye.

153
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:13,017
往下看 大人 我们同归于尽
But look down, my lord.
You'd have joined me in death.

154
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:15,519
我看你“心情”很好啊
I see you found the mood.

155
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,744
- 未来有多糟  - 你还不明白 是吗
-Will it be that bad?
-You don't get it, do you?

156
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:36,457
你并不真正了解事态的严重性
You don't really understand the grave
nature of what's happening to us.

157
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:42,212
哈克南家族统治厄拉科斯八十年
For 80 years Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

158
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,674
拥有香料产地八十年 你能想象该有多富有吗
Eighty years of owning the spice fields.
Can you imagine the wealth?

159
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:49,493
在你的眼睛里  我没有看到我要的眼神
In your eyes, I need
to see it in your eyes.

160
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,612
你从没见过哈克南人 我见过
You never met Harkonners before. I have.

161
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:54,188
他们毫无人性 他们残酷无情
They are not human. They're brutal!

162
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,769
你必须做好准备
You have to be ready.

163
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:13,910
哈克南家族的杰迪主城堡

164
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,519
男爵大人
Lord Baron.

165
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,606
拉班
Rabban.

166
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,778
我们最后一艘飞船已经离开厄拉科斯 任务完成
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis. It's done.

167
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:51,488
很好
Very good.

168
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,879
叔叔 我们怎么会让这种事发生
Uncle, how did we let this happen?

169
00:19:56,301 --> 00:20:00,757
皇帝怎么能把我们建造的一切
How can the Emperor
take everything we've built

170
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,176
拱手送给公爵 怎么能
and give it to that Duke? How?

171
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,380
别激动 这是爱
Don't be too sure, it's an act of love.

172
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,758
他什么意思
What does he mean?

173
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:20,517
祸兮福倚 福兮祸伏
When is a gift not a gift?

174
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:25,397
厄崔迪家族声势正在壮大
The Atreides Voice is rising

175
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:29,150
皇帝是个心胸狭小的人
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

176
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:33,697
一个危险且心胸狭小的人
A dangerous, jealous man.

177
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,143
保罗
Paul…

178
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,021
保罗 醒醒
Paul, wake up.

179
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:59,739
- 怎么了? - 穿好衣服跟我来
-What's wrong?
-Get dressed and come with me.

180
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:20,593
怎么了
What is this?

181
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,314
圣母盖尤斯·海伦·莫希亚姆来了
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

182
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:26,200
她是我在贝尼·杰瑟里特学校的老师
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

183
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:29,039
她现在是皇帝的真言师
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

184
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:31,757
她想见见你
She would like to meet you.

185
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:33,190

Why?

186
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:36,771
她想知道你的梦
She wants to know about your dreams.

187
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:41,113
她怎么知道我的梦?

你好 少主
Hello, young master.

190
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,172
你妈妈让我为你检查一下
Your mother asked me to check your vitals.

191
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,589
怎么了
What's happening?

192
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:05,971
贝尼·杰瑟里特的事儿 我是略有所闻 她们说她们的存在是为了能造福更多的人
Bene Gesserit claims
to serve the greater good.

193
00:23:06,138 --> 00:23:09,558
我并不想冒犯你的母亲 但说到底
But with all due respect to your mother,

194
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,979
她们做的一切都是为了她们自己人
they also serve their own agenda.

195
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,690
你什么意思
What are you saying?

196
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:18,858
当心点
Be careful.

197
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:22,820
他的心还是那么坚强 夫人
His heart is strong as ever, my lady.

198
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,491
别向任何人说
Not a word of this to anyone.

199
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:38,294
保罗
Paul…

200
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,260
记住你的训练
Remember your training.

201
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:10,910
你是谁
Who are you?

202
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:19,276
桀骜不驯的双眼 跟他父亲一样
Defiance in the eyes, like his father.

203
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,370
退下
Leave us.

204
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:24,590
你必须按圣母海伦·莫希亚姆说的一切去做
You must do everything
the Mother Helen Mohiam tells you.

205
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,886
你把我母亲当下人一样使唤
You dismiss my mother in her own house.

206
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:31,388
过来 跪下
Come here. Kneel.

207
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,854
你胆敢对我用“音言”
How dare you use the Voice on me?

208
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,779
把右手放进盒子里
Put your right hand in the box.

209
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,824
你母亲命你服从我
Your mother bade you obey me.

210
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:05,338
我在你脖子上握着戈姆刺 是一根毒针 瞬间致命
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar,
a poison needle, instant death.

211
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,861
测试很简单
The test is simple.

212
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:11,634
如果你把手从盒子中拿出来 就会死
Remove your hand
from the box, and you die.

213
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:16,391
盒子里有什么
What's in the box?

214
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,393
痛苦
Pain.

215
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,271
没必要叫侍卫
No need to call the guards.

216
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,775
你的母亲站在门外 没人能通过她
Your mother stands behind that door.
No one will get past her.

217
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,743
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

218
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,997
被陷阱捕获的动物 会咬断自己的腿逃生
An animal caught in a trap
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

219
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,040
你会怎么做
What will you do?

220
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,615
住口
Silence.

221
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,419
我绝不能恐惧
I must not fear.

222
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:30,131
我绝不能恐惧
I must not fear.

223
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,430
恐惧是思维的杀手
Fear is the mind-killer.

224
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,185
恐惧是潜伏的死神 会将人彻底毁灭
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

225
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:50,792
我将直面恐惧 任它穿过我的身心
I will face my fear and I will permit it
to pass over me and through me.

226
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,749
当恐惧消逝
And when it has gone past…

227
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:18,343
我将睁开心灵之眼 看清它的轨道
I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

228
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:25,976
恐惧所到之处 万物无存
Where the fear has gone
there will be nothing.

229
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,858
唯我独在
Only I will remain.

230
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:37,821
够了
Enough.

231
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:59,383
我们筛人如沙
Like sifting sand through a screen,
we sift people.

232
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,324
如果你像牲畜一样不能控制自己的冲动
If you had been unable to control
your impulses like an animal,

233
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:06,258
我们不能让你活下去
we could not have let you live.

234
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,728
你继承了太多力量
You inherit too much power.

235
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:13,857
- 什么 因为我是公爵的儿子? - 因为你是杰西卡的儿子
-What, because I'm a Duke's son?
-Because you are Jessica's son.

236
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:16,818
你身负不只一种血脉 孩子
You have more than one birthright, boy.

237
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:19,153
杰西卡
Jessica.

238
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:28,496
你训练得法
You've been training him in a Way.

239
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:37,046
- 告诉我那些梦 - 我今晚刚做了一个
-Tell me about these dreams.
-I had one tonight.

240
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,256
你梦到了什么
What did you see?

241
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:45,345
- 厄拉科斯星球上的一个女孩 - 你以前梦到过她吗
-A girl on Arrakis.
-Have you dreamt of her before?

242
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:51,810
很多次
Many times.

243
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:56,774
你的梦境 会常在现实发生吗
Do you often dream things that happen
just as you dreamt them?

244
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:03,197
不完全
Not exactly.

245
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:09,202
再见 年轻人 我祝你健康
Goodbye, young human.
I hope you'll live.

246
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:19,379
一定要这样测试么
Did you have to go that far?

247
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:23,091
你选择训练他道法就违反了我们的规定
You chose to train him in the Way
in defiance of the rule.

248
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:26,761
他能用我们的法力 我一定要测试他的极限
He wields our power.
He had to be tested to the limits.

249
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,275
潜力无限 可惜浪费在一个男性上
So much potential wasted in the male.

250
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:32,974
你被告知只生女儿
You were told to bear only daughters,

251
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,499
可你却妄自尊大 以为可以生出魁萨茨·哈德拉克
but you and your pride thought
you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

252
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:37,846
我错了吗
Was I wrong?

253
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:40,248
他没死在那间房里算你幸运
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

254
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:43,280
即使他是天选之子 也还有很长的路要走
If he is The One he has a long way to go.

255
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:47,532
他才刚刚觉醒而已 现在却要赴汤蹈火
His sight is barely awakened
and now he goes into the fire.

256
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,037
不过我们的计划是以千年来衡量的
But our plans are measured
in centuries.

257
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,138
如果他不能成功
We have other prospects

258
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:53,745
我们还另有预案
if he fails his promise.

259
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,209
你觉得希望如此渺茫
Do you see so little hope?

260
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,463
在厄拉科斯星球 我们已经为你竭尽所能
On Arrakis, we have done
all we can for you.

261
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,508
道路已经铺好 希望他不要辜负
The path has been laid.
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

262
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:55,181
保罗
Paul…

263
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,976
那什么意思
What does it mean?

264
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,105
- 我会是天选之子吗? - 你听到了
-That I can be The One?
-You heard?

265
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,562
贝尼·杰瑟里特成为望族们的强大伙伴
The Bene Gesserit serve
as powerful partners to the great houses,

266
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:11,599
不是没有原因的
but there's more to it.

267
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:16,786
你们暗中操纵帝国政治
You stir the politics
on the Imperium from the shadows.

268
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:19,997
- 我知道 - 可你未尽其祥
-I know.
-You don't know everything.

269
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,261
千百年来
For thousands of years,

270
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:26,322
我们一直在小心翼翼地优配血统为了培育——
we've been carefully
crossing bloodlines to bring forth--

271
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:28,088
天选之子
The One?

272
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,341
一个先知
A mind…

273
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:38,599
强大到能够突破时间和空间 过去和未来

powerful enough to breach

274
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:44,355
带领我们进入一个更美好的未来

我们认为他即将到来

278
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:15,920
屏蔽场
Shields.

279
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:02,549
“吾入此时之息 出飘落之沙”
"My lungs taste the air of Time,
Blown past falling sands."

280
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,219
杜菲·哈瓦特

281
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:56,643
少主 走上新世界是何感觉
Young master, how does it feel
to walk on the new world?

282
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:59,313
难以言表 令人兴奋
Exciting, to say the least.

283
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,274
- 大人 - 你好吗 老朋友
-My Lord.
-How are you, old friend?

284
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:05,714
我的先遣队已经接管这座城市

285
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:07,650
我们还在理顺一些棘手的地方

a few rough spots.

286
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,283

00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:18,373
利桑·阿尔·盖布
Lisan al-Gaib!

288
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:36,516
利桑·阿尔·盖布
Lisan al-Gaib!

289
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,995
不要受欢迎所愚
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

290
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:58,071
他们遵循旧主规定 强制参加
They follow their old master's rules,
mandatory attendancy.

291
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,623
以前哈克南人的最爱
That's Harkonnen love out there.

292
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:07,672
厄崔迪

293
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,707
让我们尽快离开太阳底下
Let's get you out of the sun.

294
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:25,438
这个地方热得可以杀死人
The heat can kill in this place.

295
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:43,900
他们在说我们
They were pointing at us.

296
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:45,787
他们喊的是什么
What were they shouting?

297
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:50,251
利桑·阿尔·盖布 “天外之音”
Lisan al-Gaib.
"The Voice from the Outer World."

298
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,849
这是他们对“弥赛亚”的称呼
It's their name for "messiah."

299
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,789
这意味着贝尼·杰瑟里特在这儿做了一些工作
That means that Bene Gesserit
have done a work here.

300
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,560
散播迷信
Planting superstitions?

301
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:01,015
铺平道路 保罗
Preparing the way, Paul.

302
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:06,563
这些人已经等待了几个世纪的利萨·阿尔·盖布
These people have waited
for centuries for the Lisan al-Gaib.

303
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,692
他们看到了你 他们看到了征兆
They see you, they see the signs.

304
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:16,572
他们只看到别人告诉他们要看的东西
They see what they've been told to see.

305
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,619
我们准备好了
We're good to go.

306
00:39:05,204 --> 00:39:09,916
屏蔽墙 保护城市免受天气和沙虫的侵害
Shield wall, protects the city
from the weather and the worms.

307
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,715
当地人把大的那个叫“上帝之手”
The locals call the big one
the "Hand of God."

308
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:05,638
上帝之手正在破坏我们的通讯系统
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc on our com system.

309
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,436
好安静啊
It's so quiet.

310
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:15,356
是的 这也是我担心的
Yeah. That's what worries me too.

311
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,824
那是太空港
There's a space port,

312
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:26,739
那边尘烟处是香料提炼厂
and in that plump of dust
there's a spice refinery.

313
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:30,287
我们最簿弱的两个点 我命令你死守此要地
Our two most vulnerable points.
I want you guarding them.

314
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:34,499
若我们不能提炼香料 运出外界 我们在此必死无疑
If we can't refine spice and ship it
off to the world, we're dead here.

315
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:39,171
太阳升高了 我们得封门
The sun is getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

316
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:45,052
他们怎么说这个鬼地方来着?
What do they say
about this hell hole again?

317
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,151
“相当于洗澡时 你用沙子擦屁股”
"It's a shower, you scrub
your ass with sand,"

318
00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:48,785
大人 他们是这么说的
My Lord, that's what they say.

319
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:51,058
他们是这么说的
That's what they say.

320
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:58,690
夫人 她们是应聘女管家的
Candidates for a house keeper, my lady.

321

- 你叫什么名字? - 夏道特·梅帕丝 夫人
-What is your name?

其他人可以走了 谢谢

夏道特
Shadout.

324
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:29,262
这是古契科布萨语
It's an old chakobsa word.

325
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,000
意为舀井人
"Well dipper."

326
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:33,109
你是弗雷曼人
You are Fremen.

327
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,352
- 你懂古语? - 我知道很多东西
-You know the ancient tongues?
-I know many things.

328
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,939
我知道你们身体下藏着武器
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodies.

329
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:41,565
等等
Wait.

330
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:46,028
如果你图谋不轨 我必须警告你不管你隐藏什么
If you mean to harm me,
I must warn you whatever you're hiding,

331
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,823
都于事无补
it won't be enough.

332
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:53,702
如果你是天选之子
My weapon is meant as a gift

333
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,664
我的武器就是礼物
if you are truly The One.

334
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:14,390
你知道这个吗
Do you know this?

335
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:16,392
晶牙匕
It's a crysknife.

336
00:42:19,895 --> 00:42:21,479
你知道它什么意思吗
Do you know its meaning?

337
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:23,523
做好准备
Be ready.

338
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,318
它是沙漠之主
It's a maker.

339
00:42:32,824 --> 00:42:35,701
一个沙漠深处的造物主
A maker of the deep desert.

340
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:40,284
一个人在预言中活得太久
When you have lived
with a prophecy for so long

341
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:42,344
等到启示之时必震惊不已
the moment of revelation is a shock.

342
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:46,629
利桑·阿尔·盖布 圣母和圣子
Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son.

343
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:55,429
献给你

344
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:59,350
夏胡鲁之牙

345
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:48,190

346
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:53,861
你不应该在这个时候出来
You shouldn't be out here
at this time of the day.

347
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,156
他们也在外面
They are out here.

348
00:43:58,283 --> 00:44:02,245
弗雷曼朝圣者 他们不在乎中暑
Fremen pilgrims.
They don't care about heat stroke.

349
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:07,417
我都不知道这里还有枣椰树
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

350
00:44:07,584 --> 00:44:12,547
他们不是土生土长的 没有我他们活不下去
These aren't indigenous.
They can't survive without me.

351
00:44:12,714 --> 00:44:16,926
每棵树每天需要的水量相当于五个人
Each one of these drinks every day
the equivalent of five man.

352
00:44:19,387 --> 00:44:23,516
二十棵棕榈树 一百条生命

353
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:28,104
- 我们要把它们移走吗 节约用水 - 不 不
-Should we remove them? Save the water?

354
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:30,523
这些是神圣的
These are sacred.

355
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:36,529
旧梦

356
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:48,958
厄拉科斯星球上最大、最危险的生物是沙虫

357
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:53,045

Capable of reaching 400 meters in length.

358
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:57,299
为了避免发出有节奏的噪音吸引沙虫
To avoid making rhythmic noises
which attract the sandworms,

359
00:44:57,466 --> 00:45:01,344
弗雷曼人走凌沙微步穿越沙漠
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sand walk,

360
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:04,343
模仿沙漠无规律的自然之声
a dance-like motion with irregular rhythm

361
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:07,339
犹如无节奏的舞蹈动作
which emulates the natural sounds
of the desert.

362
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:12,939
今天的厄拉科斯仍有植物全靠弗雷曼人
What scant plant life exists
on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen,

363
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:16,017
他们一直在种植深入土壤的地球植物
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terrain plants,

364
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:19,195
例如仙人掌 驴灌木
such as saguaro, burrobush,

365
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:23,200
沙地马鞭草 以及香灌木
sand verbena and incense bush.

366
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,578
牧羊人树的树根是最长的
The shepherd's tree
has the deepest documented roots,

367
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:29,831
可以伸入超过450英尺深的地下
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

368
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:36,629
这些植物都可以在炎热且贫瘠的沙漠土地中生存
These plants cling to life
in a parched nutrient-poor landscape.

369
00:46:46,824 --> 00:46:50,494
猎杀镖 刺客一定藏在附近
It's a hunter-seeker.
The operator must be nearby.

370
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:59,044
哈克南特工六周前用水泥固封在那个洞里
The Harkonnen agent was cemented
into that hole six weeks ago.

371
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,796
通过墙内的水管操纵猎杀镖
Manned the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe inside the walls.

372
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,627
陛下 我今日有辱使命 罪不容赦
Sir, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

373
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:07,339
我向你请辞
You have my resignation.

374
00:47:07,427 --> 00:47:10,471
- 你想让我们失去国之栋梁?  - 陛下 我的名誉要求
-You'd deprive us of your talents?
-Sir, my honor demands--

375
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:13,391
他们想要夺走我儿子的生命
They tried to take the life of my son!

376
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:17,323
我才不在乎你的名誉 你想要赦免 去抓刺客吧
I don't give a damn about your honor.
You want absolution? Go catch some spies.

377
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:18,811
陛下
Your Grace.

378
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:28,406
那东西必须离开
The thing must leave.

379
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:33,411
但说无妨 我们的宠物不懂你的语言
You can speak without fear.
Our pet doesn't understand your language.

380
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:35,413
滚
Get out!

381
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,628
它能理解 启动静默
It understands. Activate silence.

382
00:47:47,008 --> 00:47:50,261
皇帝的旨意是什么
What is the Emperor's message?

383
00:47:50,386 --> 00:47:53,430
他会派他的萨多卡军团
He will strengthen your hand.

384
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,593
助你一臂之力
With his Sardaukar army…

385
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,811
绝不许走漏风声
It must never be known.

386
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:06,985
厄拉科斯星球上没有卫星 厄崔迪家族将会死于黑暗
There's no satellites over Arrakis.
The Atreides would die in the dark.

387
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:08,850
关于这一点
On that matter.

388
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,236
雷托·厄崔迪公爵的死活对我们姐妹会毫无意义
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

389
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:16,411
但是他的妻子在我们保护之下 也包括她儿子
But his wife is under our protection,
and by extension, her son.

390
00:48:16,578 --> 00:48:19,372
给他们放逐的尊严
Allow them the dignity of exile.

391
00:48:23,877 --> 00:48:29,424
哈克南家族绝不会违反姐妹会神圣的命令
House Harkonnen would never dream
of violating the sanctity of your order.

392
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:33,803
我向你保证 我们不会伤害他们
I give you my word.
We would not harm them.

393
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:57,910
- 如果公爵的儿子还活着 - 厄崔迪将不复存在
-If the Duke's son lives--
-No Atreides will live.

394
00:48:58,077 --> 00:49:00,996
大人 你向女巫保证过了 她无所不知
My Lord, you gave your word to the witch.
And she sees too much.

395
00:49:01,164 --> 00:49:04,125
我说过不会伤害他们 就不会伤害他们
I said I would not harm them.
And I shall not.

396
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:07,795
但厄拉科斯是厄拉科斯
But Arrakis is Arrakis,

397
00:49:07,962 --> 00:49:11,006
沙漠会吞噬弱者
and the desert takes the weak.

398
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:14,510
我的沙漠
My desert.

399
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:18,472
我的厄拉科斯
My Arrakis.

400
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:23,226
我的沙丘
My dune.

401
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:27,389
你的第一次战略会议
Your first strategy meeting.

402
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:33,988
保罗·厄崔迪赤手空拳抓住猎杀镖 就像古代英雄一样
Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands like a hero of all.

403
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:38,116
- 谢谢你的羞辱 老家伙 - 我会看着你的
-Thanks for the humiliation, old man.
-I'll keep an eye on you.

404
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:40,285
立正
Attention!

405
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:50,670
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

406
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:54,340
杜菲 你先来
Thufir, operations.

407
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:58,845
我弄到了一份哈克南的账本
I've secured a copy
of the Harkonnen's account books.

408
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:04,183
哈克南人每年从这里带走100亿索拉里斯
The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion
solaris out of here every year.

409
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:06,612
“因其必夺 海之丰裕
"They shall suck at the abundance
of the seas

410
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,469
沙之珍宝”
and on the treasures hidden in the sand."

411
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,897
靠他们留下来的设备
We won't see profits
like that for a while,

412
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:13,082
我们一时做不到如此大的利润
not with the equipment they left us.

413
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:15,653
情况有多糟
How bad is it?

414
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:23,400
这里是香料贮窖
These are spice silos.

415
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,509
我们必须装满每一个筒仓
We are meant to fill every crate.

416
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:30,000
全部
All of them?

417
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:32,047
每25个标准日（一次）
Every 25 standard days.

418
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,543
哈克南人暗中破坏阻碍了我们
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

419
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:37,043
那谁来仲裁呢
But who's meant to arbitrate?

420
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:39,711
难道没有一个星变裁判官来监督移交吗
Isn't there a Judge of the Change
to oversee the transition?

421
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:44,056
- 皇帝任命了谁  - 帝国生态学家列特·凯恩斯博士
-Who did the Emperor appoint?
-Dr. Liet Kynes, imperial ecologist.

422
00:50:44,223 --> 00:50:47,392
在此地已待20年 据我所知 性情古怪
Been here 20 years.
Eccentric from what I'm told.

423
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,083
我想去采集香料的地方亲眼看看
I want to see
these harvesting fields myself.

424
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:51,894
请慎重 大人
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

425
00:50:52,023 --> 00:50:54,922
让这位星变裁判官陪伴我们
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

426
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,585
我们早该见面了
Our meeting is long overdue.

427
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,781
我们会得到一些帝国的保护
And we'll get a bit
of imperial protection.

428
00:50:58,885 --> 00:51:01,320
人质 我喜欢
A hostage? I love it.

429
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:05,952
他来了 大人
He's here, my lord

430
00:51:29,101 --> 00:51:30,894
照顾好他们 他们是朋友
Take care of them, they are friends.

431
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:33,438
- 邓肯! - 好小子
-Duncan!
-My boy!

432
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:42,697
- 我敢说你长高了 - 是的 你怎么臭哄哄的
-I swear you're getting taller.
-Well, you smell much worse.

433
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:48,025
我和弗雷曼人生活了四个星期
For four weeks I've lived with the Fremen,

434
00:51:48,178 --> 00:51:50,633
住在一个隐藏在沙漠中 叫做穴地的部落里
hidden in the desert,
in the community called the sietch.

435
00:51:50,747 --> 00:51:53,749
斯蒂尔格 那个穴地部落的首领跟我一起来见你 陛下
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch
has come with me to meet you, sir.

436
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:57,628
- 这个穴地部落藏在哪里 - 地下
-This sietch, how was it hidden?
-It's under ground.

437
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:59,617
厄拉科斯遍布地穴
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

438
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:00,903
那地方有多大
How big was the place?

439
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:05,427
我估计能住一万人 而穴地又有数百之多
It's a ten thousand people,
and there are hundreds of sietches.

440
00:52:06,512 --> 00:52:09,890
上百万弗雷曼人 你是对的
Millions of Fremen. You were right.

441
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:13,894
哈克南人估计整个星球上只有五万人
The Harkonnen estimate
was fifty thousand on the whole planet.

442
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:17,522
弗雷曼人观察我找寻他们数日 我却从未发现他们
The Fremen watched me search
for them for days. I never saw them.

443
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,224
终于 他们派出一名战士要杀我
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me,

444
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:24,263
说实话 我差一点就死了
and I have to tell you,
I've never come so close to dying.

445
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:27,082
帝国没有比这更好的战士
There's no finer fighter in the Imperium.

446
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,369
- 他们浴血奋战 - 沙漠力量
-They fight like demons.
-Desert power.

447
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:36,917
- 邓肯 干得好 - 谢谢 大人
-Duncan, well done.
-Thank you, my lord.

448
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:41,004
陛下 他们的首领有一把刀不肯上缴 陛下
Sir, their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sir.

449
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:43,963
晶牙匕 是他们的圣物
It's a crysknife,
it's sacred to his people.

450
00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:45,764
让他过来
Let him pass.

451
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:02,701
站住
Stop there.

452
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:05,110
嘿! 嘿
Hey! Hey!

453
00:53:10,575 --> 00:53:13,828
斯蒂尔格 欢迎
Stilgar, welcome.

454
00:53:15,413 --> 00:53:20,251
先生 我很尊重那些愿意尊重我的人
Sir, I respect the personal dignity
of any man that respects mine.

455
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:28,934
等一下
Hold.

456
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:34,452
感谢您 斯蒂尔格 用你生命之水作为见面礼
Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift
of your body's moisture.

457
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:37,476
我们接受你的这份诚意
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

458
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:47,445
你登门造访 我喜不自胜
I'm glad you've come.

459
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:51,364
我想 你我两族人 能礼尚往来
I believe your people and mine
have much to offer one another.

460
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:54,269
你们这些异星人 你们来这里是为了香料
You are outworlders,
you come here for the spice,

461
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:56,768
你们拿走它 却不付出任何回报
You take it, giving nothing in return.

462
00:53:58,539 --> 00:53:59,440
这是真的
That's true.

463
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:04,288
我深知你族 苦于哈克南
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

464
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:06,848
你有求我应
Name what you want.

465
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:10,255
必力所能及 并不取分文
If it's in my power to grant
I'll give it and ask for nothing.

466
00:54:10,342 --> 00:54:15,961
我请求你们不要滋扰我们的部族 不要侵入我们的领土
I ask for this: do not seek our sietches,
do not trespass in our lands.

467
00:54:16,104 --> 00:54:19,380
早在你们来之前 沙漠就是我们的
The desert was ours long before you came.

468
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:21,049
所以 来挖你们的香料吧
So, come and dig your spice,

469
00:54:21,137 --> 00:54:24,799
但挖到以后 滚回屏蔽墙的另一边
but when you have it,
go back to this side of the shield wall

470
00:54:24,888 --> 00:54:26,517
把沙漠留给弗雷曼人
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

471
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:29,444
你要称呼公爵为“大人”或“陛下”
You will address the Duke
as "my lord," or "sir."

472
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,946
哥尼 等一下
Gurney, just… Just a moment.

473
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:37,910
皇帝赐厄拉科斯 封为我地 护国佑民
The Emperor has given me Arrakis
as my fief to rule and protect.

474
00:54:38,078 --> 00:54:43,541
我有责在身 难以保证不过沙漠
I cannot promise not to travel
into the desert if duty compels me.

475
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:46,877
但所有穴地 必是你们的
But your sietches will be yours forever.

476
00:54:47,045 --> 00:54:49,233
在我执政期内 你们必安然无恙
and you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

477
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,680
我钦佩你的承诺
That's very honorable.

478
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:57,008
我得走了
I must go.

479
00:54:57,096 --> 00:54:58,464
我要说的就是这些
That's all I have to say to you.

480
00:54:58,556 --> 00:55:01,725
你不留下么 我们很荣幸
Why don't you stay.
We would honor you.

481
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:05,812
我的使命不在这里
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

482
00:55:06,856 --> 00:55:09,608
我认得你
I know who you are.

483
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:20,452
- 我不喜欢他 - 我们的计划有成果了
-I don't like him.
-Our plan bears fruit.

484
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:21,906
但需要时间
But it will take time.

485
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:26,293
是的 需要时间
Yes. It will take time.

486
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,712
给你的
Here, this is for you.

487
00:55:34,717 --> 00:55:36,844
定位罗盘
It's a paracompass.

488
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:41,222
这的卫星有磁场 普通的指南针不能指北
The moons here have a magnetic field, so
a simple compass needle won't point north.

489
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,474
就要这一精密仪器来处理
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

490
00:55:44,695 --> 00:55:45,815
都是弗雷曼人造的吗
Do Fremen make these?

491
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:49,564
还有蒸馏服 沙压器 各种各样的精巧发明
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,
and all kinds of ingenious things.

492
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:51,858
沙压器是什么鬼东西
What the hell is a sand compactor?

493
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:54,758
这就是沙压器
That's a sand compactor.

494
00:55:56,862 --> 00:55:58,356
我的天啊 伙计 你变本地人了
My God, man, you've gone native.

495
00:55:59,074 --> 00:56:00,261
你钦佩他们
You admire them.

496
00:56:01,493 --> 00:56:02,702
是的
I do.

497
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:05,090
他们赤胆忠心
They're fierce but loyal.

498
00:56:06,126 --> 00:56:09,974
他们熟知沙漠 这些还只是他们的一小部分
They're tuned into the desert,
part of it, it's part of them.

499
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:12,378
等你在外面见到他们
You wait till you see it.

500
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:15,422
就懂得他们的美
It's beautiful out there.

501
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:20,594
日出警告
Sunrise warning.

502
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:24,890
气温将升至140度 现在是90度
…The temperature up to 140 degrees.
The temperature now is 90 degrees.

503
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:29,437
但将在10分钟内上升50度
But it will rise
50 degrees in ten minutes.

504
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:31,147
最后警告
Last warning.

505
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:06,556
星变裁判官 陛下
The Judge of the Change, sir.

506
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,307
列特·凯恩斯博士
Dr. Liet Kynes.

507
00:57:08,475 --> 00:57:12,145
大人 公爵 欢迎来到厄拉科斯
My Lord, Duke, welcome to Arrakis.

508
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:14,160
你是帝国的生态学家
You are the imperial ecologist.

509
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:16,318
谢谢你的蒸馏服
Thank you for the stillsuits.

510
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,569
这些是弗雷曼人造的最好的
They are Fremen make, the best.

511
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,113
陛下 如果您容许 我必须检查一下是否穿戴完好
With your permission, sir,
I must check the integrity--

512
00:57:23,782 --> 00:57:25,533
没关系
It's all right.

513
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:28,786
没关系
It's all right.

514
00:57:30,121 --> 00:57:33,082
凯恩斯博士 悉听尊便
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

515
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:42,884
一件蒸馏服是一套高效的过滤系统
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

516
00:57:43,051 --> 00:57:44,853
即使是在凌晨
Even this early in the morning

517
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:47,333
没有这些东西 你也活不过两个小时
you wouldn't survive
two hours without one of these.

518
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:53,494
它能使身体降温 并回收出汗而流失的水分
It cools the body and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

519
00:57:54,816 --> 00:57:56,944
身体运动就提供动能
Your bodies movements provide the power.

520
00:57:57,982 --> 00:58:02,611
在面具里面 你会发现一个管子 让你可以喝回收的水
Inside the mask you'll find a tube
to allow you to drink the recycled water.

521
00:58:02,778 --> 00:58:07,032
在正常工作状态下 你的蒸馏服每天损失的水不会超过一点点
In good-working order your suit won't lose
more than a thimble full of water a day.

522
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,034
真历害
Most impressive.

523
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:12,537
让我看看你 小伙子
Let's have a look at you, lad.

524
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:18,084
- 你以前穿过蒸馏服吗? - 没有 我第一次穿
-You've worn a stillsuit before?
-No, this is my first time.

525
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:24,257
你的沙地靴脚踝那儿的松紧带箍得正好 谁教你的
Your desert boots off at a slip fashion
at the ankles. Who taught you to do that?

526
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:26,968
感觉这是正确之道
It seemed the right way.

527
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:33,015
“此乃正道 与生俱来 你应知道 出神入化”
"He will know his customs
as if he was born with them."

528
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,771
你是弗雷曼人吗?
Are you a Fremen?

529
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:40,308
我在穴地和乡村都被接受
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

530
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:42,459
现在
Now.

531
00:58:42,567 --> 00:58:47,321
来看看诸位赖以生存的香料沙田吧
Come and see the spice sands
on which your livelihood depends.

532
00:59:25,443 --> 00:59:28,237
如果你的扑翼机掉到这里 你怎么办
What would you do if your ornithopter
went down out here?

533
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:32,032
最好想都别想 那是沙虫之地
You wouldn't want to go down out there.
It's worm territory.

534
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:35,715
沙尘云
Dust cloud.

535
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:39,623
我看到了
I see it.

536
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:42,375
那是你的一台香料机车
That's one of your harvesters.

537
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:10,945
你可以看到香料散落在表面
You can see the spice
scattered over the surface.

538
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:15,325
从颜色判断 这里是香料的富矿床
Rich spice bed by the color.

539
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:18,023
再爬高一点 视野会更好
If you get a little higher
you'll have a better view.

540
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:35,260
你能看到侦察机 正在寻找虫迹
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for worm sign.

541
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:38,681
什么虫迹
Worm sign?

542
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:40,999
一阵向香料机车移动的沙浪
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

543
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:44,737
沙虫虽然潜伏得很深 但它们要发动攻击时会逐渐浮到地表
Worms travel deep but get closer
to the surface when they attack.

544
01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:49,942
如果你们有耐心 应该能看到
If you are patient we should see one.

545
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:54,238
- 沙虫会来么  - 一定会 它们总是被有节奏的噪音吸引
-Worm always comes?
-Always, they're drawn by rhythmic noises.

546
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:56,445
为什么不给香料机车安装屏蔽场呢
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

547
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:59,320
在沙漠里用屏蔽场无异死路一条
A shield is a death sentence
in the desert.

548
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:03,830
屏蔽场不仅吸引沙虫 更使其极度狂暴
It attracts the worms
and drives them into a killing frenzy.

549
01:01:06,334 --> 01:01:08,627
那是沙虫吗
Is that a worm?

550
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:20,365
一条大虫
Big one.

551
01:01:21,205 --> 01:01:22,446
好眼力
You have good eyes.

552
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:28,355
呼叫DA9号机车 虫迹警告 听到请回答
Calling crawler Delta Ajax 9.
Worm sign warning. Acknowledge.

553
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:32,192
谁呼叫DA9号  完毕
Who calls Delta Ajax 9? Over.

554
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:36,404
- 他们好象很淡定啊 - 临时飞行 处理帝国事务
-They seem pretty calm about it.
-Unlisted flight, Imperium business.

555
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:40,867
虫迹在东北方3.7公里
Worm sign, north and east of you.
3.7 kilometers.

556
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:44,162
DA9号 我是侦察1号 确认虫迹
Delta Ajax 9, this is Spotter 1,
worm sighting confirmed.

557
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:48,333
稍后确认到达时间
Standby for contact fix.

558
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:55,631
沙虫正在快速奔向你处 5分钟后到达
Worm is on intercept course
to your position. Contact in five minutes.

559
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,800
现在怎么办
So what happens now?

560
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,904
他们准备呼叫大型运载机去回收香料机车
They'll call the carryall
to lift the crawler.

561
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,390
他们会采集到最后一刻
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

562
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:06,517
呼叫阿尔法零号大型运载机 准备对接程序
Calling carryall Alfa Zero.
Ready to docking sequence.

563
01:02:06,684 --> 01:02:08,519
沙虫五分钟后到达 完毕
Contact five minutes, over.

564
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:15,026
有人看见大型运载机么
Anybody got a visual on a carryall?

565
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:20,740
来了
There it is.

566
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:24,660
DA9号 这是大型运载机阿尔法零号
This is carryall Alfa Zero
to Delta Ajax 9.

567
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:26,585
从你的东面接近
Approaching from your east.

568
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:29,802
校正高度 准备对接和抓取
Correcting altitude and preparing
docking and gripping.

569
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:33,293
收到 阿尔法零号 开始对接程序
Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

570
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:37,965
- T-5 - 收到
-T-5.
-Copy that.

571
01:02:38,132 --> 01:02:41,373
- 准备30秒后升空 - 启动对接程序
-Prepare to be airborne in 30 seconds.
-Docking sequence initiated.

572
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:42,840
做好准备
Brace yourselves.

573
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:48,225
阿尔法零号 有一个支点未连接
Alpha Zero, we are short
on one point of contact.

574
01:02:48,392 --> 01:02:51,645
- 怎么回事 - 有个锚坏了
-What is going on?
-It's one of the anchors. It's dead.

575
01:02:52,688 --> 01:02:54,272
该死
Shit.

576
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,235
大型运载机不能继续 没有锚就无法起飞
Carryall, unable to proceed.
Unable to lift without that anchor.

577
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:00,195
全体 全体
All call. All call.

578
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:02,580
此区的全体大型运载机请回复
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond.

579
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,299
侦察员1号 报告最新情况 完毕
Spotter 1, give us an update. Over.

580
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:09,037
液压系统坏了 无法修复 尽快撤离
Hydraulics are dead.
We won't make it. You have to evacuate.

581
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:12,081
- 香料机车上有多少人 - 21个
-How many men on that crawler?
-Crawler of 21.

582
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:15,794
- 我们飞船每艘可以载六个人 - 还差三个人
-Our ships can take six each.
-That's still three short.

583
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:17,379
我们会找到解决之道的
We'll find a way.

584
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:31,517
这是雷托·厄崔迪公爵
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

585
01:03:31,684 --> 01:03:34,864
我们准备下来带走DA9号的人
We're coming down
to extract the crew of Delta Ajax 9.

586
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:36,031
所有人集中左侧
Sit down on the left.

587
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:49,952
一台屏蔽场发生器重达一百公斤
The shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

588
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:53,956
好 哥尼 让侍卫扔掉屏蔽场发生器
Yes, Gurney, have our escort
throw out the shield generators.

589
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:57,084
保罗 我要你在扑翼机后面 指挥他们进来
And Paul, I want you at the back
of the thopter, guide them in.

590
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:01,088
DA9号 立刻在我们的飞船上各安排7个人
Delta Ajax 9, put seven
men each in my ships now.

591
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,773
沙虫两分钟后到达
Contact in two minutes.

592
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,902
快来了 伙计们 我们最好现在弃船
It's getting close, guys.
We better abandon the ship now.

593
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,655
他们在哪儿
Where are they?

594
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,390
陛下 这是有规定的
Sir, there is protocol for a reason,

595
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,656
只要我们跨出一步 我们就死定了
if we take one step out
we're as good as dead.

596
01:05:15,184 --> 01:05:17,663
另外 我们装满了香料 不能就这样离开
Besides, we've got full load
of spice, we can't just leave--

597
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:21,416
该死的香料 我要所有人立刻离开香料机车
Damn the spice! I want
every man off that crawler now!

598
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,779
七个这边 七个那边
Seven over here, seven over there!

599
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,564
快跑 快跑
Run, run!

600
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:03,542
魁萨茨·哈德拉克
Kwisatz Haderach.

601
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:19,181
魁萨茨·哈德拉克醒了
Kwisatz Haderach awakes.

602
01:06:28,566 --> 01:06:30,526

It's here!

604
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,706
保罗
Paul!

605
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,417
保罗
Paul!

606
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:54,675
我认得你的脚步声 老家伙
I recognize your footsteps, old man.

607
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:57,970
起来 我们走
Get up. Let's go.

608
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:02,098
你怎么了 快点 我们走
What's wrong with you?
Come on. Let's go.

609
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:03,600
快跑
Run!

610
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:53,857
“赞美主和它的水 赞美它降临逝去
"Bless the Maker and His water.
Bless the coming and going of Him.

611
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:59,238
愿它所到之处 净化大地 为民护地”
May His passage cleanse the world.
And keep the world for His people."

612
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:26,390
- 嘿 你不能这样冒险 - 是的 陛下
-Hey, you cannot take such risks.
-Yes, sir.

613
01:08:26,557 --> 01:08:30,102
- 你有责任 - 我很抱歉 陛下 下不为例
-You do have responsibilities.
-I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

614
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:32,729
凯恩斯博士
Dr. Kynes.

615
01:08:34,231 --> 01:08:37,150
你亲眼所见
You saw it with your own eyes.

616
01:08:37,318 --> 01:08:40,025
很明显 他们留给我们的一团糟
It's plain to see. Everything
they've left us is in shambles.

617
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:41,572
我们注定要失败
We've been set up to fail.

618
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:47,285
那辆大型运载机太旧了 沙漠对设备并不友善
That carryall was just old.
The desert isn't kind to equipment.

619
01:08:48,996 --> 01:08:52,958
你知道如果我不让香料生产回到正轨会发生什么吗
You know what will happen if I don't get
spice production back on track?

620
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,213
我不是来帮你的
I'm not here to take your part.

621
01:08:59,381 --> 01:09:04,469
厄拉科斯见证了像你这样的人来来去去
Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.

622
01:09:06,096 --> 01:09:09,432
好好照顾你的家人
Take good care of your family.

623
01:09:12,852 --> 01:09:17,147
沙漠对人类也不友善
The desert's not kind to humans either.

624
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:38,460
香料是一种影响精神活动的物质 你好象对它很敏感
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.
You seem to be sensitive.

625
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:45,425
并无大碍
You'll be fine.

626
01:09:45,593 --> 01:09:48,262
谢谢你 岳医生
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

627
01:09:57,188 --> 01:10:00,274
这不是过敏反应
It wasn't an allergic reaction.

628
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:03,149
我看见一个幻象
I had a vision.

629
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:07,482
我睁大眼睛看
My eyes were wide open.

630
01:10:09,742 --> 01:10:11,785
你看到了什么
What did you see?

631
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:51,616
魁萨茨·哈德拉克
Kwisatz Haderach...

632
01:10:51,783 --> 01:10:54,785
你可以看到
You can see.

633
01:11:36,471 --> 01:11:41,205
梦境很混乱 我好像看到我死了 但又不是
It's confusing, I thought
I saw my death, only it wasn't.

634
01:11:42,374 --> 01:11:45,752
不知为何 有一把刀很重要
I know a knife is important somehow.

635
01:11:47,796 --> 01:11:50,340
有人递给我一把刀
Someone will hand me a blade.

636
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:53,843
但我不知道是何人 何时 何地
But I don't know who or when or where.

637
01:11:56,304 --> 01:12:01,058
可又有一些事我心里很清楚 我能感受到
Some things though
are crystal clear. I can feel it.

638
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:06,592
我知道你怀孕了
I know you're pregnant.

639
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:15,990
你不可能知道
You can't know that.

640
01:12:16,157 --> 01:12:19,368
我自己也才刚知道 不过几周而已
I barely know that
and it's only been few weeks.

641
01:12:26,084 --> 01:12:29,587
萨卢萨二号帝国陆军行星

642
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,787
男爵为何需要我们
What does the Baron want with us?

643
01:13:03,954 --> 01:13:09,125
哈克南家族的兵力远超厄崔迪家族
The Harkonnen outnumber Atreides.

644
01:13:10,377 --> 01:13:13,838
厄崔迪军团勇冠帝国
Atreides legions are the finest
in the Imperium.

645
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:16,550
由哥尼·哈勒克和邓肯·爱达荷训练
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

646
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:24,015
我们是萨多卡军团 帝霸出征 寸草不生
We are the Sardaukar, the Emperor's elite.
Anyone who defies us will fall.

647
01:13:25,183 --> 01:13:27,393
没错
Just so.

648
01:13:27,561 --> 01:13:30,188
三个营 说好的
Three battalions as agreed.

649
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:38,821
诏之即来 战之必胜
As the the Emperor commands.
It will be done.

650
01:14:10,728 --> 01:14:13,105
有些关于保罗的事你需要知道
There's something you need
to know about Paul.

651
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:16,942
不 我不想知道
No. I don't think I wanna know.

652
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:19,556
自从你带他见圣母后
Ever since you brought him before
your Reverend Mother

653
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:21,448
他像变了个人
he hasn't been the same.

654
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:26,118
他心烦意乱
He's distracted.

655
01:14:26,285 --> 01:14:29,538
杰西卡 你给了我一个儿子
Jessica, you gave me a son.

656
01:14:29,705 --> 01:14:32,916
从他出生的那一刻起我就不曾质疑你
And from the moment he was born
I never questioned you.

657
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:37,545
我完全信任你 即使你背着我行事
I trusted you completely,
even when you walked in shadows.

658
01:14:38,839 --> 01:14:41,883
现在我只问你一件事
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

659
01:14:43,385 --> 01:14:47,972
如果我有任何不测 你会保护我们的儿子吗
If anything happens
will you protect our son?

660
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:51,142
不惜生命
With my life.

661
01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:55,312
我不是在问他的母亲 我是在问贝尼·杰瑟里特
I'm not asking his mother,
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

662
01:14:58,233 --> 01:15:01,069
你会保护保罗吗
Will you protect Paul?

663
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,742
你为什么想这些
Why are you having these thoughts?

664
01:15:14,124 --> 01:15:17,168
雷托 这不像你
Leto, this is not you.

665
01:15:22,382 --> 01:15:24,884
我以为我们还有时间
I thought we'd have more time.

666
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:47,906
- 晚安 保罗少主 - 晚安 岳医生
-Have a good night, Master Paul.
-Good night, Dr. Yueh.

667
01:15:57,917 --> 01:16:00,586
你需要好好睡一觉
You need to sleep.

668
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:04,339
不 不要那个
No, not like that.

669
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:21,939
我真应该娶你
I should have married you.

670
01:17:39,474 --> 01:17:42,268
哈瓦特 叫侍卫
Hawat. Security.

671
01:17:43,562 --> 01:17:45,313
侍卫
Security!

672
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:50,294
长官 长官
Sir. Sir.

673
01:18:50,461 --> 01:18:52,379
屏蔽墙关闭了
The shield's come down.

674
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,015
老天在上
God in Heaven.

675
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:05,517
所有飞行器起飞 快
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

676
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,875
跟我来
With me!

677
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:27,239
厄崔迪
Atreides!

678
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,187
萨多卡
Sardaukar!

679
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:24,004
对不起 大人
I'm sorry, my lord.

680
01:22:26,214 --> 01:22:30,051
但我已和男爵达成了协议
But I've made a bargain with the Baron.

681
01:22:31,553 --> 01:22:35,765
- 为什么? - 我别无选择
-Why?
-I had no choice.

682
01:22:35,932 --> 01:22:38,270
哈克南人绑架了我的妻子 万娜
The Harkonners have my wife, Wanna.

683
01:22:39,745 --> 01:22:42,002
他们把她像玩具一样肢解
They take her apart like a doll.

684
01:22:43,314 --> 01:22:47,317
我想换取她的自由 而你就是代价
I will buy her freedom
and you are the price.

685
01:22:50,071 --> 01:22:53,199
我会竭尽所能交给保罗
For Paul. I will do what I can.

686
01:22:54,116 --> 01:22:57,577
而你要为我杀死一人
And you will kill a man for me.

687
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,753
我会替换你的锥形牙
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

688
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,799
只要你用力一咬 这颗牙就会碎裂
If you bite them hard,
this tooth will crash.

689
01:23:10,966 --> 01:23:14,969
呼气 空气中就充满了毒素
Breathe out, and you will fill
the air with poison.

690
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:17,112
这将是你的最后一口气
It will be your last breath.

691
01:23:18,114 --> 01:23:20,295
但是如果你的时机选择得好
But if you choose your moment well

692
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,687
它也将是男爵的最后一口
it will also be the Baron's.

693
01:24:57,654 --> 01:24:59,405
保罗
Paul.

694
01:25:12,544 --> 01:25:18,633
我们一会把他们扔进沙漠 丢给沙虫
We will drop them in the desert,
and leave them to the worms.

695
01:25:18,758 --> 01:25:22,344
为何不直接割喉杀掉
Why not just cut their throats?

696
01:25:22,512 --> 01:25:26,849
要是真言师问起这事
They might use a Truthsayer.

697
01:25:27,892 --> 01:25:30,644
我们就可以说没有杀他们
Then we can honestly say
that we didn't kill them.

698
01:25:36,818 --> 01:25:40,363
那个疤脸是聋子
The one with the scar is deaf.

699
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:23,363
去死吧 狗
To hell, dogs!

700
01:27:58,957 --> 01:28:02,668
我从来没搞过一个贵族
I've never had a high-born.

701
01:28:04,004 --> 01:28:07,382
- 你呢? - 贝尼·杰瑟里特不算贵族
-You?
-Bene Gesserit ain't no high-born.

702
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:11,511
她出身高贵 对我来说足够了
She is high-born enough for me.

703
01:28:11,678 --> 01:28:15,765
把这小孩拿去喂沙虫 让他们母子永别
Let's feed the kid to the worms
and give her a long goodbye.

704
01:28:15,932 --> 01:28:18,100
你敢碰我母亲试试
Don't you dare touch my mother.

705
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:20,894
别说话
Don't talk.

706
01:28:25,775 --> 01:28:28,903
不 你还没准备好
No. You're not ready.

707
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:34,033
拿开她的嘴塞
Remove her gag.

708
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:43,960
闭嘴
Shut up.

709
01:28:44,127 --> 01:28:47,088
找到正确的音调
Find the right tone.

710
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:58,181
我们够远了 把男孩扔下去
We're far enough.
Let's throw the boy off.

711
01:29:12,655 --> 01:29:15,282
拿开她的嘴塞
Remove her gag.

712
01:29:20,537 --> 01:29:22,497
杀了他
Kill him.

713
01:29:30,297 --> 01:29:33,133
放开我们
Set us free.

714
01:29:44,936 --> 01:29:47,855
停 割断绳子
Stop. Cut the rope.

715
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:52,401
把刀给我
Give me the knife.

716
01:30:00,952 --> 01:30:03,871
你的音调太生硬了
Your pitch was too forced.

717
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:13,338
这是一个弗雷曼生存包
It's a Fremkit.

718
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:27,478
他们破坏了飞船
They've crippled the ship.

719
01:32:03,155 --> 01:32:06,908
你的厨房真好 表弟
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

720
01:32:24,381 --> 01:32:26,678
这是岳医生的笔迹
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

721
01:32:27,374 --> 01:32:32,145
“如果有人活着逃出厄拉科斯 生存包里有厄崔迪的信号器
"If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive
there's an Atreides beacon in the Fremkit.

722
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,473
上帝保佑他们找到你”
God willing they'd be able to find you."

723
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:45,780
男爵大人 岳医生
Milord Baron, Dr. Yueh.

724
01:32:45,947 --> 01:32:47,398
叛徒
The traitor?

725
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:49,721
你有何求
What do you want?

726
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:54,789
我切断通讯 关闭屏蔽墙
I jammed their comms
and lowered their shields.

727

我把公爵和他的家人送来
I gave you Duke and his family.

728
01:32:59,335 --> 01:33:04,214
谈条件爽快点 你有何求于我

释放我饱受痛苦的妻子
Deliver my wife from her agony.

730
01:33:07,927 --> 01:33:09,261

01:33:42,795 --> 01:33:47,716
我承诺过我会还她自由 那你才能与她重聚
I said I'd set her free,
that you could join her.

732
01:33:51,595 --> 01:33:53,596
与她重聚吧
So join her.

733
01:34:02,522 --> 01:34:04,523
你认为接下来会发生什么
What do you think is next?

734
01:34:08,278 --> 01:34:09,904
一个沙槌
It's a thumper.

735
01:34:10,718 --> 01:34:11,884
没有蒸馏服
No stillsuits.

736
01:34:12,722 --> 01:34:14,504
那才是我们真正需要的
The one thing we actually need.

737
01:34:19,372 --> 01:34:22,804
数个世纪以来 我们血债血偿
For hundreds of years
we've traded blood for blood.

738
01:34:24,019 --> 01:34:25,409
但日后不再
But no more.

739
01:34:27,297 --> 01:34:31,384
你儿子死了 你的妾也死了
Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead.

740
01:34:31,551 --> 01:34:34,637
今晚厄崔迪家族陨落
Tonight the house Atreides falls…

741
01:34:36,973 --> 01:34:39,892
你家血脉从此终结
and your bloodline ends forever.

742
01:34:53,614 --> 01:34:56,074
你刚才说什么
What did you say?

743
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:09,003
“我在此 我存在”
"Here I am, here I remain!"

744
01:36:53,106 --> 01:36:56,651
- 凯恩斯! - 你在这里不安全
-Kynes!
-It's not safe for you here.

745
01:36:56,818 --> 01:36:59,965
你能告诉兰兹拉德最高委员会我们是怎样被出卖的吗
Will you tell the Great House
of the Landsraad how we were betrayed?

746
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,548
他们中最优秀的是如何被谋杀的
How the best of them were murdered?

747
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:07,411
我奉命闭口不谈 视若不见
I am commanded to say nothing,
to see nothing.

748
01:37:09,414 --> 01:37:11,791
皇帝是让我们来这送死

The Holy war is spreading across
the universe like an unquenchable fire.

Paul, you're scared. I can see it.
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

放开我
Get off me!

你造就了我你们贝尼·杰瑟里特把我变成怪胎
You did this to me!

有人在附近
Someone is near.

01:42:14,058 --> 01:42:16,674
你需要喝水
You need to drink.

769
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,968
这是帐篷里的循环水

来自汗水和眼泪

The Harkonnens hit every population
center on the planet at once.

783
01:44:50,575 --> 01:44:53,577
那么说 皇帝要对付我们
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

784
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:56,957
星变裁判官怎么说
What says the Judge of the Change?

785
01:44:57,734 --> 01:44:59,896
皇帝禁止我说任何话
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

786
01:45:00,042 --> 01:45:03,044
但你冒生命危险来帮我们
Yet you risk your life to help us.

787
01:45:22,356 --> 01:45:23,857
沙暴就要来了
The storm is coming.

788
01:45:38,288 --> 01:45:43,000
沙暴几小时后就会到 我们在这里很安全
The storm will be here in a few hours.
We'll be safe here.

789
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:47,547
你知道这是什么地方吗? 一个早年建造的生态试验站
Do you know what this place is?
It's an old ecological testing station.

790
01:45:51,301 --> 01:45:53,184
他们本想改造这颗星球
The were meant to tame the planet

791
01:45:53,277 --> 01:45:55,751
释出沙子下面的水
and free the water locked
beneath the sands.

792
01:45:58,672 --> 01:46:00,646
厄拉科斯本可以成为天堂
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

793
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:04,335
然而工程刚开始 就发现了香料
The work had begun
but then the spice was discovered.

794
01:46:04,423 --> 01:46:07,220
突然之间 没有一个人希望沙漠消失
and suddenly no one wanted
the desert to go away.

795
01:46:07,317 --> 01:46:10,209
塔纳特 你能给我们的访客找几套蒸馏服么
Tanat, will you find
stillsuits to fit our visitors.

796
01:46:10,313 --> 01:46:11,347
是的 列特
Yes, Liet.

797
01:46:11,435 --> 01:46:14,323
- 沙米尔 上几杯咖啡 - 好的 列特
-Shamir, coffee service, please.
-Of course, Liet.

798
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:19,703
你是弗雷曼的什么人
Who are you to the Fremen?

799
01:47:08,668 --> 01:47:11,921
你知道望族最害怕什么吗 凯恩斯博士
Do you know what the great houses
fear most, Dr. Kynes?

800
01:47:13,507 --> 01:47:16,259
就是这里发生的一切
Exactly what has happened to us here.

801
01:47:16,426 --> 01:47:19,428
被皇帝的萨多卡军团各个击破
The Sardaukar coming
and picking them off one by one.

802
01:47:22,432 --> 01:47:26,310
只有团结一致 他们才有一线希望对抗帝国
Only together can they stand a chance
against the Imperium.

803
01:47:27,896 --> 01:47:29,243
你愿意作证吗
Would you bare witness?

804
01:47:30,174 --> 01:47:32,974
证明皇帝在这里对我们做的一切
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here.

805
01:47:33,276 --> 01:47:35,666
如果他们相信我
If they believe me…

806
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:40,071
望族和皇帝之间将会发生全面战争
There would be general warfare
between the great houses and the Emperor.

807
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:43,202
混乱会蔓延整个帝国
Chaos across the Imperium.

808
01:47:43,369 --> 01:47:47,581
但假设我给皇帝一个混乱之外的选择
Let's suppose I present to the Emperor
with an alternative to chaos.

809
01:47:47,748 --> 01:47:51,293
皇帝没有儿子 只有尚待出嫁的女儿
And the Emperor has no sons,
and his daughters are yet to marry.

810
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:54,246
你想上演权力的游戏
You'd make a play for the throne?

811
01:47:54,703 --> 01:47:58,120
皇帝惧怕厄崔迪家族 让你们来这就是为了斩草除根
The Emperor feared the Atreides.
He brought you here to kill you.

812
01:47:58,225 --> 01:48:00,127
你还不明白吗
What don't you understand?

813
01:48:00,803 --> 01:48:03,722
你就像一个躲在地洞里迷路的男孩
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

814
01:48:08,394 --> 01:48:11,480
弗雷曼人称我为利桑·阿尔·盖布
The Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib.

815
01:48:11,647 --> 01:48:13,273
小心点
Careful.

816
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:17,026
“天外之音”将引领他们进入天堂
The Voice from the Outer World
who will lead them to paradise.

817
01:48:18,612 --> 01:48:19,573
迷信
Superstition.

818
01:48:24,618 --> 01:48:28,830
我知道你爱过一个弗雷曼战士 在战斗中失去了他
I know you loved a Fremen warrior
and lost him in battle.

819
01:48:30,916 --> 01:48:34,419
我知道你穿行两个世界 且以不同的名字为人熟知
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

820
01:48:39,549 --> 01:48:41,592
我知道你的梦想
I've seen your dream.

821
01:48:45,909 --> 01:48:47,389
若我作皇帝 凯恩斯博士
As Emperor, Dr. Kynes,

822
01:48:47,494 --> 01:48:50,659
只要我一挥手 就可以给你一个天堂般的厄拉科斯
I could make a paradise for Arrakis
with the wave of my hand.

823
01:48:52,103 --> 01:48:56,065
你真的认为他会是马赫迪吗
Do you really think he could be the Mahdi?

824
01:48:57,275 --> 01:48:59,026
他看起来太年轻了
He looks very young.

825
01:50:46,549 --> 01:50:48,759
萨多卡!
Sardaukar!

826
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:54,515
- 不! 邓肯! - 保罗 不
-No! Duncan!
-Paul, no!

827
01:50:58,436 --> 01:51:02,022
- 邓肯 不! - 他把门锁上了
-Duncan, no!
-He's locked the door.

828
01:51:51,404 --> 01:51:52,451
他死了
He's gone.

829
01:51:53,104 --> 01:51:54,062
邓肯
Duncan!

830
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,854
我们必须走 我们别无选择
We have to go. We have no choice.

831
01:52:03,541 --> 01:52:05,751
保罗 快跑
Paul, run!

832
01:52:24,854 --> 01:52:26,689
快点 快点
Come on, come on!

833
01:52:58,428 --> 01:53:01,498
跟着光走 会发现一架扑翼机 随时可以起飞
Follow the light. You'll find
a thopter ready to fly.

834
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:03,806
外面的沙暴是你最好的机会
That storm out there
is your best shot.

835
01:53:03,934 --> 01:53:08,646
沙暴超过五千米高 大部分是沙尘 飞上去 保持高度
Above 5000 meters, it's mostly dust.
Climb into it. Stay on top.

836
01:53:08,846 --> 01:53:11,878
- 一直往南 去找弗雷曼人 - 你不跟我们一起走吗
-Head south. Find the Fremen.
-You're not coming with us?

837
01:53:11,965 --> 01:53:13,200
只有两个座位
It only sits two.

838
01:53:13,289 --> 01:53:16,899
我会去下一个试验站 向兰兹拉德最高委员会报告这次袭击
I'll go to the next station
and report this attack to the Landsraad.

839
01:53:16,988 --> 01:53:18,823
怎么去?
How?

840
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:22,028
我是弗雷曼人 沙漠是我家
I'm Fremen. The desert is my home.

841
01:53:23,661 --> 01:53:26,288
- 好运 - 好运
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

842
01:56:02,859 --> 01:56:06,612
凯恩斯 你背叛了皇帝
Kynes, you have betrayed the emperor.

843
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:08,719
我只侍奉一位主人
I serve only one master.

844
01:56:09,469 --> 01:56:12,389
他的名字叫夏胡鲁
His name is Shai-Hulud.

845
01:56:57,955 --> 01:57:00,105
我们后面有喷气机
There are jet flyers behind us.

846
01:57:33,156 --> 01:57:34,824
保罗 我们还不够高
Paul, we are not high enough!

847
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:10,943
我绝不能恐惧 恐惧是思维的杀手
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.

848
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:14,571
恐惧是潜伏的死神 会将人彻底毁灭
Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration.

849
01:58:20,286 --> 01:58:23,288
去见朋友
See the friend.

850
01:58:32,756 --> 01:58:36,259
人生的奥秘并不是一个需要解决的问题
The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve.

851
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:40,763
而是一个需要体验的现实
But a reality to experience.

852
01:58:44,309 --> 01:58:48,813
一个不能通过停止来理解的过程
A process that cannot be understand
by stopping it.

853
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:52,316
我们必须随着进程的流动而前进
We must move with the flow
of the process.

854
01:58:52,484 --> 01:58:56,154
我们必须加入它 我们必须随着它沉浮
We must join it.
We must float with it.

855
01:58:56,780 --> 01:59:00,366
放手 放手
Let it go. Let it go.

856
01:59:33,566 --> 01:59:36,017
他还没有完全康复
He hasn't fully healed yet.

857
01:59:47,413 --> 01:59:51,458
我们追杀他们进入科里奥利风暴
We chased them into a Coriolis storm.

858
01:59:52,918 --> 01:59:55,795
风速每小时800公里
Wind's at 800 kilometers an hour.

859
01:59:59,758 --> 02:00:02,427
没有人能在这样的风暴中幸存
Nothing survives such a storm.

860
02:00:02,594 --> 02:00:07,015
他们必死无疑
They're dead. It's a certainty.

861
02:00:14,356 --> 02:00:18,026
总算完成了
So it's done finally.

862
02:00:18,514 --> 02:00:24,031
向杰迪主星发消息 开始卖我们库存的香料
Send word to Giedi Prime
to begin selling our spice reserves.

863
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:28,161
慢点卖 我们不希望价格下跌
But slowly.
We don't want the price to fall.

864
02:00:29,245 --> 02:00:33,290
你无法想象 我将这样的军力运上前线 要花多少钱
You have no idea how much it cost me
to bring such a force to barrier.

865
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:37,253
现在我只有一个要求 收入
Now I only have one requirement. Income.

866
02:00:38,254 --> 02:00:42,132
去榨干他们 拉班 使劲榨
So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard.

867
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:43,525
是的 叔叔
Yes, uncle.

868
02:00:45,371 --> 02:00:46,257
那弗雷曼人呢
And the Fremen?

869
02:00:47,513 --> 02:00:49,765
统统杀光
Kill them all.

870
02:01:12,413 --> 02:01:13,956
我们在5000米以上
We're above 5000 meters.

871
02:02:52,011 --> 02:02:55,681
我们一着陆 就向岩石跑
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

872
02:04:46,832 --> 02:04:49,459
用这个来呼吸
You breathe with this.

873
02:05:19,071 --> 02:05:21,053
现在我们必须找到弗雷曼人
Now we have to find the Fremen.

874
02:05:22,825 --> 02:05:25,577
- 你没事吧  - 没事
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

875
02:06:32,477 --> 02:06:34,145
保罗
Paul…

876
02:06:40,777 --> 02:06:43,654
不要害怕
Don't be frightened.

877
02:06:44,864 --> 02:06:48,659
即使是沙漠里的小老鼠也能活下来
Even a little desert mouse can survive.

878
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:55,458
你需要直面你的恐惧
You'll need to face your fears.

879
02:06:55,625 --> 02:07:00,087
一个朋友会帮助你
A friend will help you.

880
02:07:00,254 --> 02:07:03,590
跟着那位朋友
Follow the friend.

881
02:07:05,342 --> 02:07:07,502
你还有很多东西要学
You have much to learn.

882
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:11,973
我将指引你沙漠之道
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

883
02:07:14,476 --> 02:07:15,935
跟我走吧
Come with me.

884
02:07:43,797 --> 02:07:47,300
邓肯住过的穴地部落
The sietch, where Duncan lived.

885
02:07:47,467 --> 02:07:49,552
应该就在前边
Somewhere off that way.

886
02:07:52,207 --> 02:07:54,419
我可以看到绿色植被
I can see the green over there.

887
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:55,891
在那儿
There.

888
02:07:56,142 --> 02:07:57,931
说明弗雷曼人就住在那里
That means Fremen live there.

889
02:08:02,607 --> 02:08:07,528
我们天黑后过去 弗雷曼人就是这么做的
We'll cross after dark.
That's how the Fremen do it.

890
02:08:09,864 --> 02:08:11,825
我们即将进入沙虫之地
We're about to enter worm territory.

891
02:08:12,657 --> 02:08:15,448
我们不能像正常人一样行走 不然我们就死定了
We can't walk like regular humans,
if we do - we're dead.

892
02:08:15,578 --> 02:08:19,164
我们必须像弗雷曼人那样走路 这叫凌沙微步
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do.
It's called the sand walk.

893
02:08:19,332 --> 02:08:21,483
至少家里的胶片书是这么说的
At least according
to the film books back home.

894
02:08:22,473 --> 02:08:23,660
是的 是的 我知道了
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it.

895
02:08:23,794 --> 02:08:27,214
好 跟着我 做同样的动作
Okay, follow me. Do the same moves.

896
02:08:40,248 --> 02:08:41,865
我认为这是正确的方向
I think this is the right direction.

897
02:10:04,185 --> 02:10:08,397
就在附近 我们走吧
It's close by. Let's get out of here.

898
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:11,733
等等
Wait.

899
02:10:13,277 --> 02:10:15,028
这是鼓沙
It's drum sand.

900
02:10:19,241 --> 02:10:20,408
快跑
Run!

901
02:10:26,331 --> 02:10:28,332
跑 跑
Go! Go!

902
02:11:39,737 --> 02:11:41,321
沙槌
It's a thumper.

903
02:11:46,952 --> 02:11:49,704
有人启动了沙槌
Someone set off a thumper.

904
02:12:03,343 --> 02:12:05,511
保罗 快跑
Paul, run!

905
02:12:20,235 --> 02:12:24,238
它们有多大 简直疯了
How big are they? That was insane.

906
02:12:27,575 --> 02:12:30,160
有人引开了他
Someone called him.

907
02:12:38,252 --> 02:12:41,338
这里还有别人
We are not alone.

908
02:13:01,817 --> 02:13:02,825
别跑
Do not run.

909
02:13:04,197 --> 02:13:07,378
只会浪费身体的水
You will only waste your bodies water.

910
02:13:07,948 --> 02:13:10,200
等等
Hold.

911
02:13:16,373 --> 02:13:18,083
斯蒂尔格
Stilgar.

912
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:22,796
你认识我 你来参加我父亲的会议时我在场
Hey, you know me. I was there
when you came to my father's council.

913
02:13:22,963 --> 02:13:25,048
他是公爵的儿子
This is the Duke's son.

914
02:13:25,215 --> 02:13:28,801
你还等什么 我们需要他们的水
Why are you waiting?
We need their water.

915
02:13:28,969 --> 02:13:32,430
这就是我跟你说过的那个男孩 我们不能碰他
This is the boy I told you about.
We can't touch him.

916
02:13:32,597 --> 02:13:36,726
- 他是利桑·阿尔·盖布吗 - 他还没有证明自己
-Is he Lisan al-Gaib?
-He hasn't proved himself.

917
02:13:36,893 --> 02:13:40,438
- 他们是弱者 - 詹米
-They're weaklings.
-Jamis…

918
02:13:40,605 --> 02:13:44,900
他们勇敢地在沙虫之地闯出一条道路
There was a brave crossing
they made in the path of Shai-Hulud.

919
02:13:45,068 --> 02:13:47,954
他的言行举止不像一个弱者
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

920
02:13:49,231 --> 02:13:51,051
他的父亲也一样
Nor did his father.

921
02:13:51,139 --> 02:13:53,659
我的沙槌救了他的命
My thumper saved his life.

922
02:13:53,826 --> 02:13:58,247
醒醒吧 斯蒂尔格 他不是天选之子
Go back to reason, Stilgar.
He's not The One.

923
02:14:00,708 --> 02:14:02,501
我们有强大的朋友
We have powerful friends.

924
02:14:02,668 --> 02:14:07,005
你们帮助我们离开这里 去卡拉丹 你们会得到很好的回报
You help us off world, to Caladan,
you will be well rewarded.

925
02:14:07,173 --> 02:14:12,303
你能提供什么财富 比得上你身体里的水
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water in your flesh.

926
02:14:16,515 --> 02:14:19,704
这个男孩还小 他可以学习我们的生活之道
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

927
02:14:20,492 --> 02:14:22,287
他可能获得庇护
He may have sanctuary.

928
02:14:23,314 --> 02:14:25,321
但那个女人没有受过训练
But the woman isn't trained

929
02:14:28,234 --> 02:14:29,513
太老了 学不会
and too old to learn.

930
02:15:01,977 --> 02:15:03,371
退后 你们这些蠢货
Back, you dogs!

931
02:15:04,787 --> 02:15:06,172
她会割断我的喉咙
She'll cut my throat.

932
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:15,949
你为何不说你是练过玄秘之道的女战士
Why didn't you say you were
a weirding woman and a fighter?

933
02:15:16,116 --> 02:15:18,409
我们聊得不多
The conversation ran short.

934
02:15:18,576 --> 02:15:21,790
冷静 女人 冷静
Peace, woman, peace.

935
02:15:23,017 --> 02:15:24,232
我走眼了
I misjudged.

936
02:15:32,757 --> 02:15:37,845
太阳升起来了 我们必须赶往泰布穴地
The sun is rising.
We must reach Sietch Tabr.

937
02:15:39,263 --> 02:15:41,932
这些陌生人的命运将在那里决定
The fate of the strangers
will be decided there.

938
02:15:47,146 --> 02:15:51,858
在那之前 他们都受我庇护
Until then, they are under my protection.

939
02:15:53,527 --> 02:15:56,154
我向你保证
I give you my word.

940
02:16:03,878 --> 02:16:05,955
我不会让你伤害我的朋友
I would not have let you
hurt my friends.

941
02:16:31,356 --> 02:16:33,014
他们说你是马赫迪
They say you are the Mahdi.

942
02:16:33,765 --> 02:16:35,643
但你看起来像个小男孩
But you look like a little boy.

943
02:16:37,362 --> 02:16:40,865
你选择了最艰难的上山之道 我会告诉你更简单的
You chose the hardest way up. Follow me.

944
02:16:42,575 --> 02:16:45,452
出发 出发
Take off! Take off!

945
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:48,845
把它给我
Give it to me.

946
02:16:56,297 --> 02:16:59,488
当你配得上 你会拥有属于自己的毛拉手枪
You would have your own maula pistol
when you've earned it.

947
02:16:59,644 --> 02:17:00,906
把它给我
Give it to me.

948
02:17:06,432 --> 02:17:10,622
契妮 你负责新来的人 确保他们在旅途中平安无事
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.
See that they are safe in the journey.

949
02:17:10,827 --> 02:17:11,782
我们走
Let's go.

950
02:17:12,104 --> 02:17:14,689
我不带他们
I will not have them.

951
02:17:20,029 --> 02:17:23,907
詹米 我已经说过了 别胡来
Jamis, I have spoken. Be still.

952
02:17:24,074 --> 02:17:28,328
你说话像个领袖 但只有最强大的人才是领袖
You talk like a leader,
but the strongest leads.

953
02:17:29,747 --> 02:17:32,332
她击败了你
She bested you.

954
02:17:32,499 --> 02:17:35,335
我要提出艾姆泰尔法则
I invoke the Amtal.

955
02:17:35,502 --> 02:17:39,005
- 你不能挑战萨亚迪娜女祭司 - 那谁会以她之名战斗
-You may not challenge a sayyadina.
-Then who will fight in her name?

956
02:17:39,173 --> 02:17:44,386
詹米 别这样 别这样 黑夜快过去
Jamis, don't do this. Don't.
The night is fading.

957
02:17:44,553 --> 02:17:47,327
那就让太阳来见证死亡吧
Then the sun will witness this death.

958
02:17:47,565 --> 02:17:49,305
她的捍卫者在哪
Where is her champion?

959
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:03,279
我接受她的捍卫者
I accept her champion.

960
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:37,117
保罗·厄崔迪必须死
Paul Atreides must die…

961
02:18:40,316 --> 02:18:44,778
为了魁萨茨·哈德拉克的崛起
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

962
02:18:47,656 --> 02:18:52,853
不要害怕 不要反抗
Don't be frightened. Don't resist.

963
02:18:59,084 --> 02:19:03,969
遇人杀人 遇神杀神
When you take a life, you take your own.

964
02:19:35,662 --> 02:19:39,415
我不相信你们是利桑·阿尔·盖布
I don't believe you are the Lisan al-Gaib.

965
02:19:39,582 --> 02:19:42,251
但我希望你死得光荣
But I want you to die with honor.

966
02:19:53,179 --> 02:19:56,682
这把晶牙匕是我姑奶奶送给我的
This crysknife was given to me
by my great-aunt.

967
02:19:59,227 --> 02:20:03,648
它是用大沙虫夏胡鲁的一颗牙齿做成的
It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud,
the great sand worm.

968
02:20:04,607 --> 02:20:07,568
如果你拿着它死去 将是一个巨大的荣誉
This would be a great honor
if you to die holding it.

969
02:20:11,781 --> 02:20:14,283
异星人在哪里
Where is the outworlder?

970
02:20:18,746 --> 02:20:23,834
詹米是个好战士 他不会让你受折磨的
Jamis is a good fighter.
He won't let you suffer.

971
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:26,253
契妮
Chani…

972
02:20:38,599 --> 02:20:39,683
没关系
Never mind.

973
02:21:35,321 --> 02:21:38,699
愿你刀断人亡
May your knife chip and shatter.

974
02:21:45,247 --> 02:21:47,086
你应该感谢我的剑
You should welcome my blade.

975
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:52,921
世道艰难 人必有一死
This world will kill you.

976
02:21:55,799 --> 02:21:57,133
此路最快
Quicker this way.

977
02:22:37,048 --> 02:22:38,600
还不投降
Do you yield?

978
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:43,262
这孩子不知道我们的规矩
The boy does not know our rule.

979
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:47,368
艾姆泰尔法则没有投降 只有死亡
There is no yielding under the Amtal
rule, only death is the test of that.

980
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:57,668
- 他在玩弄他么  - 没有
-Is he toying with him?
-No.

981
02:22:59,153 --> 02:23:00,655
保罗从没杀过人
Paul has never killed a man.

982
02:23:11,874 --> 02:23:15,627
魁萨茨·哈德拉克
Kwisatz Haderach.

983
02:23:19,006 --> 02:23:22,008
魁萨茨·哈德拉克
Kwisatz Haderach.

984
02:23:22,176 --> 02:23:25,887
站起来 觉醒吧
Climb up. Rise.

985
02:25:18,665 --> 02:25:22,376
你现在是我们的一员了 一命换一命
You're one of us now. A life for a life.

986
02:25:22,544 --> 02:25:25,463
- 跟我们一起去泰布穴地 - 不
-Come with us to Sietch Tabr.
-No.

987
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:27,173
保罗需要离开这里
Paul needs to get off world.

988
02:25:27,278 --> 02:25:30,288
你们一定有门道 你们有走私贩 有飞船
You must have ways.
You have smugglers, you have ships.

989
02:25:30,441 --> 02:25:31,858
- 没有 - 你们有
-No.
-You have--

990
02:25:32,985 --> 02:25:34,888
是皇帝派我们来的
The Emperor sent us to this place.

991
02:25:36,432 --> 02:25:38,086
我父亲来到这里
And my father came…

992
02:25:39,185 --> 02:25:43,772
不是为了香料 不是为了财富
Not for spice, not for the riches,

993
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:45,460
而是为了你们的力量
but for the strength of your people.

994
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:51,018
我的人生之路将走向沙漠
My road leads into the desert.

995
02:25:53,741 --> 02:25:56,034
我能看见
I could see it.

996
02:25:57,662 --> 02:26:01,576
只要你们愿意接受我们 我们就跟你们走
If you'll have us, we will come.

997
02:26:50,672 --> 02:26:51,827
沙漠力量
Desert power.

998
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:54,868
这只是开始
This is only the beginning.
