1
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,110
我的星球 厄拉科斯 在日落时分尤为美丽
My planet, Arrakis, is so beautiful when the sun is low.

2
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,580
尘沙翻滚...
Rolling over the sands...

3
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,500
你可以看到空气中都弥漫着香料
You can see spice in the air.

4
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,640
旁晚时分 香料收割机登陆
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

5
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,890
外来者争分夺秒的收割 因为他们要躲避炽热的白天
The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day.

6
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,820
他们在我们眼前蹂躏我们的土地
They ravage our lands in front of our eyes.

7
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,490
据我所知 他们对我们的人民异常残忍
Their cruelty to my people is all I've known.

8
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,880
哈科宁人 这些外来者  早在我出生之前就来了
These outsiders, The Harkonnens, came long before I was born.

9
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,670
通过控制香料生产 他们变得非常富有
By controlling the spice production they became obscenely rich.

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,510
甚至比皇帝还富有
Richer than the Emperor himself.

11
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,850
我们的战士也无法将厄拉科斯从哈科宁人手中解救出来
Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

12
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,230
但是有一天 皇帝颁布法令 哈科宁人消失了
but one day, by imperial decree, they were gone.

13
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,410
皇帝为什么要这么做 我们的下一个压迫者又会是谁呢
Why did the Emperor choose this path? And who'd our next oppressors be?

14
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,380
你起这么早 不错
It's good you're up early.

15
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,000
父亲命你在皇帝的使者到来之前穿上正装
Father wants you in full dress before the Emperor's herald arrives.

16
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,880
正装 还是军装
Full dress? Military?

17
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,300
礼服
Ceremonial.

18
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,220
既然已经决定了 为什么还要经历这一切呢
Why do we have to go through all of this when it's already been decided?

19
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,770
仪式需要
Ceremony.

20
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,150
谢谢
Thank you.

21
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,730
如果你想要水 就叫我给你
If you want it make me give it to you.

22
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,610
用密语说 妈妈 我才刚睡醒
Use the Voice. Mom, I just woke up.

23
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,130
把水给我 这声音连玻璃都听不见 你得命令我
Give me the water. The glass can't hear you. Command me.

24
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,320
把水给我
Give me the water.

25
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,540
差不多了 差不多了?
Almost. Almost?

26
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,260
贝尼·格瑟里特的密语技能需要很多年才能学会 保罗
Bene Gesserit skills take years to learn, Paul.

27
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,890
你看起来很疲惫 做了很多梦吗
You look tired. More dreams?

28
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,270
没有
No.

29
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,480
极端温度和变化无常的天气
Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events

30
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,240
让厄拉科斯城外的生活条件变得异常恶劣
make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile.

31
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,030
沙尘暴的威力足以穿透金属
With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through the metal.

32
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,870
只有被称为弗里曼人的土著部落能够适应这种条件 从而生存下来
Only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive.

33
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,960
他们更喜欢居住在厄拉科斯最偏远的地区
Preferring to inhabit the remotest regions of Arrakis

34
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,630
弗里曼人与巨大的沙虫居住在沙漠深处
the Fremen share the deep desert with the giant sandworms

35
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
弗里曼人将沙虫称为沙胡鲁德
known to the Fremen as Shai Hulud.

36
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,470
长期接触香料给他们部落带来了特有的蓝色眼睛
Long exposure to spice has given the tribe their characteristic blue eyes,

37
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,720
伊巴德之眼
the eyes of Ibad.

38
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,430
其他人对弗里曼人知之甚少
Little else is known of the Fremen,

39
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,650
只知道他们异常危险 而且很不可靠
except that they are dangerous and unreliable.

40
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,740
由于弗里曼人的侵袭 收割香料变得困难重重
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting extremely hazardous.

41
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,360
对弗里曼人来说 香料是神圣的迷幻剂
For the Fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen

42
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,200
不仅能维持生命 还很有益于身体健康
which preserves life and brings enormous health benefits.

43
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,420
对于帝国而言 香料则能帮助太空行会的领航员们
For the Imperium, the spice is used by the navigators of the Spacing Guild

44
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,290
找到星球之间的安全路径
to find safe paths between the stars.

45
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,630
没有香料 就无法进行星际旅行
Without spice interstellar travel is impossible,

46
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,140
这也使得香料成为了字宙中最有价值的物质
making it by far the most valuable substance in the universe.

47
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,520
注意微笑 格尼
Smile, Gurney.

48
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,610
我在微笑呢
I am smiling.

49
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,150
他们大老远跑来参加这个仪式 要花多少钱
How much will it cost them traveling all this way for this formality?

50
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,870
三名行会领航员需要花费1460062索拉里斯币用于往返旅行
Three Guild navigators and a total of 1,460,062 solaris for the round trip.

51
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,300
承蒙皇帝沙达姆·科里诺四世
By the grace of Shaddam IV of the House Corrino,

52
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,100
登上已知宇宙帕迪沙皇帝的金狮宝座的恩典
Ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe,

53
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,480
我作为变革的先驱站在你们面前
I stand before you as Herald of the Change.

54
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,610
我们在此将得到朝廷成员
We are witnessed by members of the Imperial Court,

55
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,990
太空协会代表 以及贝内·格表里特女先知的见证
representatives of the Spacing Guild, and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

56
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,950
皇帝有旨
The Emperor has spoken:

57
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,090
"厄崔迪家族应立即接管厄拉科斯
"House Atreides shall immediately take control of Arrakis

58
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,330
并掌管此地"
and serve as its steward."

59
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,500
你领旨吗
Do you accept?

60
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,310
我们是厄崔迪家族
We are the House Atreides.

61
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,150
我们绝不抗旨 我们绝不弃信
There is no call we do not answer. There is no faith that we betray.

62
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,150
皇帝要求我们给厄拉科斯带来和平
The Emperor asks us to bring peace to Arrakis.

63
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,360
厄崔迪家族必不辱使命
House Atreides accepts.

64
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,530
厄崔迪
Atreides!

65
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,300
盖下你的印戒
Your seal.

66
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,790
所以 就这些流程吗
So, it's done?

67
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,500
就这些
It's done.

68
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,780
怎么了 稳定器太松了
How was it? The stabilizers are too loose.

69
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,410
我来处理 谢谢你 我的朋友
I'll handle that. Thank you, my friend.

70
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,660
邓肯 好小子
Duncan. My boy!

71
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,380
保罗 我的好小子
Paul, my boy.

72
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,670
那么 你明天要和先遣部队一起去厄拉科斯吗
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team?

73
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,420
是的 我明天要和先遣部队一起去厄拉科斯
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team.

74
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,010
我想让你带我一起去 你想去吗
I'd like you to take me with you. You would?

75
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,810
那可惨了 因为你不能去
That's too bad, cause no.

76
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,520
邓肯
Duncan...

77
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,060
你是想把我送上军事法庭吗 到底怎么回事啊
Are you trying to give me court martial? What's going on?

78
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,990
我能信任你吗 绝对可以 你知道的
Can I trust you with something? Always. You know that.

79
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,780
我一直在做梦
I've been having dreams.

80
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,210
关于厄拉科斯和弗里曼人
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

81
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,590
好吧 所以呢
Okay, so?

82
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,220
我看到你了
I saw you.

83
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,140
和弗里曼人在一起
With the Fremen.

84
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,400
所以我真的找到他们了吗 那是好兆头啊
So I do find them? There you go. That's a good omen right there, right?

85
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,070
兰维尔
Lanville!

86
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,000
我看到你躺在床上死了 在战斗中阵亡
I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle.

87
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,170
我觉得如果我去那里的话 你可能能活下来
I felt like if I had been there you'd be alive.

88
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,900
首先 我不会死的
First of, I'm not gonna die.

89
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,250
你根本没把我的话当回事 这就是你想和我一起去的原因吗
You're not taking me seriously. That's why you wanna come with me?

90
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,460
听着 梦里面什么都有
Listen, dreams make good stories,

91
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,330
但只有我们醒着的时候 发生的一切才尤为重要
but everything important happens when we're awake,

92
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,440
因为醒着的才是真实的
because that's where we make things happen.

93
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,690
看看你 长了不少肌肉了呀 有吗
Look at you, put up some muscle? I did?

94
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,110
没有
No.

95
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,240
等到了厄拉科斯再见 小子
See you in Arrakis, my boy.

96
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,830
父亲 父亲我想申请跟邓肯·爱达荷一起
Father, I'd like to ask to join Duncan Idaho

97
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,900
明天去厄拉科斯执行侦察任务
on a scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow.

98
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,740
我学过弗里曼语 能派得上用场
I've studied the Fremen language. I'd be an asset.

99
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,990
想都别想
Out of the question.

100
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,600
你必须等几周后才能跟我们剩下的人过去
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis like the rest of us.

101
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,650
我一生都在训练... 如果派不上用场
I've been training my whole life... What is the point if I'm not allowed

102
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,420
你知道原因的 保罗 你是厄崔迪家族的未来
You know why, Paul. You're the future of the House Atreides.

103
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,710
祖父曾以身斗牛为乐
And grandfather fought bulls for sport.

104
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,210
是啊 看看他的下场
Yes, look where that got him.

105
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,410
我需要你在我身边
I need you by my side.

106
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,970
等我们到达厄拉科斯时 我们会面对巨大的危险
When we get to Arrakis we'll face enormous danger.

107
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,690
什么危险 是弗里曼人 还是沙漠
What danger? The Fremen? The desert?

108
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,020
政治风险
Political danger.

109
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,990
我们领导着的大家族 威胁到了皇帝
The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the Emperor.

110
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,450
把厄拉科斯从哈科宁家族手中夺走 把它变成了我们的
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours

111
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,000
皇帝是在酝酿一场削弱两大家族的战争
he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses.

112
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,250
但如果我们坚定不移地挖掘出厄拉科斯的真正力量
But if we hold firm and tap the true power of Arrakis

113
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,670
我们可以比以往任何时候都更强大
we could be stronger than ever.

114
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,970
什么意思
What does that mean?

115
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,000
开采香料 弗里曼会无动于衷吗
Mining spice, keeping the Fremen in their place?

116
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,510
我们不会比哈科宁家族好到哪里去
We'd be no better than Harkonnens.

117
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,510
不 我们是要与弗里曼人结盟
No. By making an alliance with the Fremen.

118
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,140
我派邓肯·爱达荷就是去安排这件事
That's what I've sent Duncan Idaho to arrange.

119
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,150
在这里 在卡拉丹 我们培养了空中力量和海上力量
Here, on Caladan, we've ruled by air power and sea power.

120
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,110
在厄拉科斯 我们需要培养沙漠力量
On Arrakis, we need to cultivate desert power.

121
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,320
我要你参加我的会议 了解我的工作
I want you sitting in on my council, learn what I do.

122
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,030
如果我不想呢 爸爸
What if I'm not, dad?

123
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,700
不想做什么
Not what?

124
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,290
我不想当厄崔迪家族的未来
The future of the House Atreides.

125
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,390
我也曾告诉我父亲我也不想这样
I told my father I didn't want this either.

126
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,520
我曾经梦想成为一名飞行员 你从来没跟我讲过
I wanted to be a pilot. You never told me that.

127
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,070
你祖父说过 伟大的人不会想成为领导
Your grandfather said, "A great man doesn't seek to lead.

128
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,870
但一经召唤 必勇于承担
He's called to it. And he answers."

129
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,870
如果你不想
And if your answer is "no"

130
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,840
你还是我唯一需要做准备的人
you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be,

131
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,420
我的儿子
my son.

132
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,140
我自己做好了自己的选择 也许你也会
I found my own way to it. Maybe you'll find yours.

133
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
在这一些回忆里...
In their memory...

134
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,240
你也需试试
give it a try.

135
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,250
不要背对着门站着
Don't stand with your back to the door.

136
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,880
我们要告诉你多少次
How many times do we have to tell you?

137
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,390
我从脚步声就知道是你 格尼·哈莱克
I could tell it was you by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

138
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,500
万一别人模仿我的脚步声呢
Someone might imitate my stride.

139
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,210
我能分辨出来 你现在是新的兵器大师了吗
I know the difference. Are you the new weapons master?

140
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,540
邓肯·爱达荷离开了 我必须尽我所能
With Duncan Idaho gone, I must make do as best as I can.

141
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,870
选一把你的刀吧
Choose your blade.

142
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,440
格尼 我今天已经够呛了 不如我们来唱首歌吧
I've had quite a day, Gurney. Give us a song instead.

143
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,150
真粗鲁
That's rude.

144
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,300
来吧 来吧
Come on. Come on.

145
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,420
老人家
Old man.

146
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,520
这么慢的速度都能击穿你的屏蔽场
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

147
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,910
我猜我今天没心情 心情 这跟心情有什么关系
I'm guessing I'm not in the mood today. Mood? What's mood got to do with it?

148
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,660
战争可不会管你心情好不好 赶紧 来战斗
You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now, fight!

149
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,830
来吧
Come on!

150
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,470
我打败你了 没错
I have you. Aye.

151
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,310
但是请你低头看看 你会和我一起死的
But look down, my lord. You'd have joined me in death.

152
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,810
我看你现在心情不错了
I see you found the mood.

153
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,040
情况真的很糟吗 你还不明白吗
Will it be that bad? You don't get it, do you?

154
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,750
看来你没有真正了解 现在的事情到底有多严重
You don't really understand the grave nature of what's happening to us.

155
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,510
80年来 厄拉科斯一直属于哈科宁家族
For 80 years Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen.

156
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,970
他们管理香料国八十年了 你能想像他们有多富有吗
Eighty years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth?

157
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,790
在你的眼睛里 我没有看到该有的眼神
In your eyes, I need to see it in your eyes.

158
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,900
你以前从没见过哈科宁人 我见过
You never met Harkonners before. I have.

159
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,480
他们不是人 禽兽不如
They are not human. They're brutal!

160
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,060
你必须做好准备
You have to be ready.

161
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,820
男爵大人
Lord Baron.

162
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,900
拉班
Rabban.

163
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,070
我们最后一艘飞船已经离开了厄拉科斯 已经全部完成
The last of our ships have left Arrakis. It's done.

164
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,790
非常好
Very good.

165
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,170
叔叔 我们怎么能容忍这种事
Uncle, how did we let this happen?

166
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,040
皇帝怎么能夺走我们所打造的一切
How can the Emperor take everything we've built

167
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,460
拱手送给那个公爵 怎么能这样
and give it to that Duke? How?

168
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,680
别这样 这是爱
Don't be too sure, it's an act of love.

169
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,060
什么意思
What does he mean?

170
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,810
塞翁失马焉知非福
When is a gift not a gift?

171
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,690
厄崔迪家族声名鹊起
The Atreides Voice is rising

172
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,450
皇帝是个善妒的人
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

173
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,990
危险 善妒
A dangerous, jealous man.

174
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,440
保罗...
Paul...

175
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
保罗 醒醒
Paul, wake up.

176
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,040
怎么了 穿上衣服跟我来
What's wrong? Get dressed and come with me.

177
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,890
怎么了
What is this?

178
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,610
尊敬的盖尤斯·海伦·莫希亚姆女先知在这里
The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

179
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,490
她是我在贝内格塞里特学院的老师
She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school.

180
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,340
她现在是皇帝的先知
She's now Truthsayer to the Emperor himself.

181
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,050
她想见见你
She would like to meet you.

182
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,490
为什么
Why?

183
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,060
她想听听你的梦
She wants to know about your dreams.

184
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,410
她怎么知道我的梦的
How does she know about my dreams?

185
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,960
岳医生怎么会在这里 他只需要耽搁你一小会儿
And why is Dr. Yueh here? He only needs a moment.

186
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,000
你好 少爷
Hello, young master.

187
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,460
你妈妈让我检查一下你的生命体征
Your mother asked me to check your vitals.

188
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,890
发生什么事了呢
What's happening?

189
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,120
他的心脏一如既往的健康 夫人
His heart is strong as ever, my lady.

190
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,590
保罗
Paul...

191
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:11,210
你是谁
Who are you?

192
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,570
眼睛里带着挑衅的神情 就像他父亲一样
Defiance in the eyes, like his father.

193
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,670
你出去吧
Leave us.

194
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,890
你必须照海伦·莫希亚姆先知告诉你的去做
You must do everything the Mother Helen Mohiam tells you.

195
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,190
你把我妈妈赶出了她自己的房子
You dismiss my mother in her own house.

196
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,690
到这儿来 跪下
Come here. Kneel.

197
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,160
你怎么敢对我使用密语
How dare you use the Voice on me?

198
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,080
把你的右手放进盒子里
Put your right hand in the box.

199
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,130
你母亲吩咐你得服从我的命令
Your mother bade you obey me.

200
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,640
我只需在你的脖子上扎一根戈姆·贾巴尔的毒针 你立马毙命
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar, a poison needle, instant death.

201
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,160
这个测试很简单
The test is simple.

202
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,930
只要你把手从盒子里拿开 你就必死无疑
Remove your hand from the box, and you die.

203
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,690
这盒子里是什么
What's in the box?

204
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,690
痛苦
Pain.

205
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,570
你没必要叫警卫
No need to call the guards.

206
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,080
你妈妈就在那扇门后面 没有她的吩附 谁也进不来
Your mother stands behind that door. No one will get past her.

207
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,050
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

208
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,300
落入陷阱的动物会咬断自己的腿逃跑
An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

209
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,340
你会怎么做
What will you do?

210
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,920
安静
Silence.

211
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,720
我不能害怕
I must not fear.

212
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,430
我不能害怕
I must not fear.

213
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,730
恐惧是心灵杀手
Fear is the mind killer.

214
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,490
恐惧会带来毁灭
Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.

215
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,090
我得直面我的恐惧 当恐惧来袭时
I will face my fear and I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

216
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,050
我得让恐惧随风而逝
And when it has gone past...

217
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,650
我得敞开心扉 看着恐惧来去
I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

218
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,280
恐惧消失之地 什么也不会留下
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

219
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,160
只有我会留下
Only I will remain.

220
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,130
够了
Enough.

221
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,690
就像筛沙子一样 我们只是负责筛人
Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people.

222
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,620
如果你像动物一样 无法控制自己的冲动
If you had been unable to control your impulses like an animal,

223
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,560
我们就不能让你活下去
We could not have let you live.

224
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,030
你要继承的权力实在太多
You inherit too much power.

225
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,160
因为我是公爵的儿子吗 因为你是杰西卡的儿子
What, because I'm a Duke's son? Because you are Jessica's son.

226
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,120
你生来就被赋予了太多权力 孩子
You have more than one birthright, boy.

227
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,460
杰西卡
Jessica.

228
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,800
某种程度上来说 你一直在训练他
You've been training him in a Way.

229
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,350
给我讲讲这些梦吧 我今晚就做了个梦
Tell me about these dreams. I had one tonight.

230
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,560
梦到了什么
What did you see?

231
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,650
厄拉科斯的一个女孩 你以前梦见过她吗
A girl on Arrakis. Have you dreamt of her before?

232
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,120
梦到过很多次了
Many times.

233
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,080
你梦到的事总是变成了现实吗
Do you often dream things that happen just as you dreamt them?

234
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,500
也不全是
Not exactly.

235
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,510
再见 年轻人 我希望你能活下来
Goodbye, young human. I hope you'll live.

236
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,690
你非得这样做吗
Did you have to go that far?

237
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,400
你无视规则选择用这种方式训练他
You chose to train him in the Way in defiance of the rule.

238
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,070
他使用了我们的力量 就必须接受最大限度的考验
He wields our power. He had to be tested to the limits.

239
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,580
在男人身上浪费了太多的潜力
So much potential wasted in the male.

240
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,270
你本来只能生女儿
You were told to bear only daughters,

241
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,810
但是你出于自尊 总认为你能生出救世主
but you and your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

242
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,150
我错了吗
Was I wrong?

243
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,550
你应该感到幸运 他没有死在那个房间里
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

244
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,580
如果他就是救世主 那他还有很长的路要走
If he is The One he has a long way to go.

245
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,840
他的洞察力还未被唤醒 现在却身陷火海
His sight is barely awakened and now he goes into the fire.

246
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,340
不过我们的计划是以世纪为单位来计算的
But our plans are measured in centuries.

247
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,440
如果他没有成功
We have other prospects

248
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,040
我们还有别的希望
if he fails his promise.

249
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,520
你所看到的希望真就这么渺茫吗
Do you see so little hope?

250
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,770
在厄拉科斯 我们已经为你做了我们能做的一切
On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you.

251
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,820
道路已经铺设好了 希望他不要浪费时机
The path has been laid. Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

252
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,490
保罗
Paul...

253
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,290
什么意思
What does it mean?

254
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,410
我可以成为救世主? 你听到了?
That I can be The One? You heard?

255
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,870
贝内·格塞里特家族跟各大家族都是合作伙伴
The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners to the great houses,

256
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,900
但其实还有更深层的原因
but there's more to it.

257
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,090
你在暗中搅动帝国的政治
You stir the politics on the Imperium from the shadows.

258
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,310
我知道 你并不知道全情
I know. You don't know everything.

259
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,570
万载千秋
For thousands of years,

260
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,620
我们一直在小心翼翼地跨越血统 就是为了诞生...
we've been carefully crossing bloodlines to bring forth

261
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,400
救世主吗
The One?

262
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,650
一个...
A mind...

263
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,910
强大到足以突破空间和时间 过去和未来的...
powerful enough to breach space and time, past and future...

264
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,660
能帮助我们走向更美好的未来的人
who can help us into a better future.

265
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,830
我们认为已经快找到他了
We think he's very close now.

266
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,300
有些人觉得他就在这里
Some believe he is here.

267
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,850
这都是你们计划的一部分
All part of the plan.

268
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,230
开启屏蔽场
Shields.

269
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,860
"我的肺吸入了时间的气息 吹过了飘落的沙子"
"My lungs taste the air of Time, Blown past falling sands."

270
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,530
苏菲尔·哈瓦特
Thufir Hawat.

271
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,960
少爷 新世界感觉如何
Young master, how does it feel to walk on the new world?

272
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,630
算是挺兴奋的吧
Exciting, to say the least.

273
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,590
大人 你好吗 老朋友
My Lord. How are you, old friend?

274
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,020
我的先遣部队已经守卫了这座城市
My advance team has secured the city.

275
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,960
我们还在清理一些不顺的地方
We're still smoothing out a few rough spots.

276
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,600
夫人
My Lady.

277
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,690
(异域先知)
Lisan al Gaib!

278
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,830
(异域先知)
Lisan al Gaib!

279
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,310
别被他们的欢迎愚弄了
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

280
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,380
他们只是遵循他们的老主人的规则 强制侍从
They follow their old master's rules, mandatory attendancy.

281
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,940
哈科宁人喜欢在外面搞这些玩意儿
That's Harkonnen love out there.

282
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,990
厄崔迪
Atreides!

283
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
我带你们离开这吧
Let's get you out of the sun.

284
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,740
这个地方热得要命
The heat can kill in this place.

285
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,210
他们喊的是我们
They were pointing at us.

286
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,100
他们在喊什么
What were they shouting?

287
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,560
Lisan al Gaib 意思是异域先知
Lisan al Gaib. "The Voice from the Outer World."

288
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,160
这是他们对 "救世主" 的称呼
It's their name for "messiah."

289
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,100
这意味着贝内格瑟里特家族在这里做了些事
That means that Bene Gesserit have done a work here.

290
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,870
散布迷信吗
Planting superstitions?

291
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,320
这叫开辟道路 保罗
Preparing the way, Paul.

292
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,880
这些人已经等了几个世纪的救世主
These people have waited for centuries for the Lisan al Gaib.

293
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,010
他们看到你 看到了征兆
They see you, they see the signs.

294
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,890
他们看到的不过是道听途说的而已
They see what they've been told to see.

295
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,940
我们可以走了
We're good to go.

296
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,230
屏蔽墙 能保护城市免受天气和沙虫的侵袭
Shield wall, protects the city from the weather and the worms.

297
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,030
当地人称之为 "上帝之手"
The locals call the big one the "Hand of God."

298
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,960
上帝之手正在破坏我们的通讯系统
Well, the Hand of God is wreaking havoc on our com system.

299
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,750
好安静啊
It's so quiet.

300
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,670
嗯 这也是我所担心的
Yeah. That's what worries me too.

301
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,140
那里有一个太空港
There's a space port,

302
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,050
在那厚厚的灰尘里有一家香料精炼厂
and in that plump of dust there's a spice refinery.

303
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,610
我们最薄弱的两个地方 我要你看好
Our two most vulnerable points. I want you guarding them.

304
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,820
如果我们不能提炼香料运出去 我们就完蛋了
If we can't refine spice and ship it off to the world, we're dead here.

305
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,490
太阳升起来了 我们得把门封起来
The sun is getting too high. We need to seal the doors.

306
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,370
他们是怎么形容这的
What do they say about this hell hole again?

307
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,470
"纯天然沐浴 你能用沙子洗澡"
"It's a shower, you scrub your ass with sand,"

308
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,100
大人 他们是这么说的
My Lord, that's what they say.

309
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,380
是这么说的啊
That's what they say.

310
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,010
这些是管家候选人 夫人
Candidates for a house keeper, my lady.

311
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,240
你叫什么名字 沙多特·麦普斯 夫人
What is your name? Shadout Mapes, my lady.

312
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,660
你们剩下的可以走了 谢谢
The rest of you may go. Thank you.

313
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,580
沙多特
Shadout.

314
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,580
这是一古老的脉轮单词
It's an old chakobsa word.

315
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,310
意思是 "优秀的浸染工"
"Well dipper."

316
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,430
你是弗里曼人
You are Fremen.

317
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,670
你很精通古语吗 我精通很多东西
You know the ancient tongues? I know many things.

318
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,260
我还知道你们体内藏着武器
I know that you have a weapon concealed in your bodies.

319
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,890
等等
Wait.

320
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,350
如果你想伤害我 我必须警告你 不管你体内藏着什么武器
If you mean to harm me, I must warn you whatever you're hiding,

321
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,140
肯定不够使的
it won't be enough.

322
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,020
我的武器是一件礼物
My weapon is meant as a gift

323
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,980
如果你真的是救世主
if you are truly The One.

324
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,710
你知道这个吗
Do you know this?

325
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,710
这是一把晶牙匕
It's a crysknife.

326
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,800
你知道这意味着什么吗
Do you know its meaning?

327
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,840
做好准备
Be ready.

328
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,640
意味着造物者
It's a maker.

329
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,020
来自沙漠深处的造物者
A maker of the deep desert.

330
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,600
当你带着一个预言生活了这么久
When you have lived with a prophecy for so long

331
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,660
等到启示之时一定深感震惊吧
the moment of revelation is a shock.

332
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,950
异域先知 母与子
Lisan al Gaib. The mother and the son.

333
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,750
这归你了
It is yours.

334
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,670
沙虫之齿
Tooth of Shai Hulud.

335
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,510
你好
Hello.

336
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,180
这么热你不该来这里
You shouldn't be out here at this time of the day.

337
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,480
他们都在外面啊
They are out here.

338
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,570
那是弗里曼朝圣者 他们不怕中暑
Fremen pilgrims. They don't care about heat stroke.

339
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,740
我没想到这里还能找到棕榈树
I didn't know date palms could even be found out here.

340
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,870
这些可不是自然生长的 没有我它们活不下去
These aren't indigenous. They can't survive without me.

341
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,250
每棵树每天需要的水量相当于五个人
Each one of these drinks every day the equivalent of five man.

342
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,840
二十棵棕榈树 能供一百个人用水
Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives.

343
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,430
为什么不砍了这些树 节约用水 不 不
Should we remove them? Save the water? No, no.

344
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,850
这些树是神圣的
These are sacred.

345
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,850
怀着古老的梦想
Old dream.

346
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:49,280
厄拉科斯上最庞大最危险的有机体是沙虫
The largest and the most dangerous organism on Arrakis is the sandworm.

347
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,370
能够长到400米长
Capable of reaching 400 meters in length.

348
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,620
为避免发出有带奏的声音引来沙虫
To avoid making rhythmic noises which attract the sandworms,

349
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,670
弗里曼人穿越沙漠时
the Fremen cross desert spaces using the sand walk,

350
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,660
会用不规则节奏的舞姿前行
a dance like motion with irregular rhythm

351
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,650
模仿沙漠的自然声音
which emulates the natural sounds of the desert.

352
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,260
厄拉科斯仅存的植物要归功于弗里曼人
What scant plant life exists on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen,

353
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,340
他们种植了深根植物
who have cultivated deep rooted terrain plants,

354
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,520
如萨瓜罗 囊泡果
such as saguaro, burrobush,

355
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,520
沙马鞭草和香丛
sand verbena and incense bush.

356
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,900
金树树根最深
The shepherd's tree has the deepest documented roots,

357
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,160
能伸展超过450英尺深
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

358
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,950
这些植物在干燥贫瘠的土地上生存
These plants cling to life in a parched nutrient poor landscape.

359
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,820
是猎镖 一定有什么人在附近
It's a hunter seeker. The operator must be nearby.

360
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,370
哈科宁的特工是六周前被塞进那个洞的
The Harkonnen agent was cemented into that hole six weeks ago.

361
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,120
通过墙内的水管操纵猎镖
Manned the hunter seeker through a water pipe inside the walls.

362
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,950
先生 我今天让您失望了 都怪我
Sir, I failed you today. There's no excuse.

363
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,660
我向你提交辞呈
You have my resignation.

364
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,800
你想让我们失去你这么优秀的人才? 先生 我的失职让我有辱声誉
You'd deprive us of your talents? Sir, my honor demands

365
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,720
他们想害我儿子性命
They tried to take the life of my son!

366
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,650
我不在乎你的声誉 你想要赎罪吗 抓几个间谍吧
I don't give a damn about your honor. You want absolution? Go catch some spies.

367
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,130
遵命
Your Grace.

368
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,730
让那玩意儿出去
The thing must leave.

369
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,740
您尽管说 宠物是听不懂话的
You can speak without fear. Our pet doesn't understand your language.

370
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,740
滚出去
Get out!

371
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,950
它听得懂 保持安静
It understands. Activate silence.

372
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,140
绝对不能让任何人知道
It must never be known.

373
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:07,310
厄拉科斯上空没有卫星 厄崔迪家族会在黑暗中葬身
There's no satellites over Arrakis. The Atreides would die in the dark.

374
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,170
还有一件事
On that matter.

375
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,560
莱托·厄崔迪公爵与我们毫无瓜葛
Duke Leto Atreides means nothing to our order.

376
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,740
但他的妻子得受我们保护 因此 她的儿子也得受我们保护
But his wife is under our protection, and by extension, her son.

377
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,700
让他们享有流放该有的尊严
Allow them the dignity of exile.

378
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,750
哈科宁家族做梦也不敢违背您的神圣指令
House Harkonnen would never dream of violating the sanctity of your order.

379
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,130
我答应你 我们不会伤害他们的
I give you my word. We would not harm them.

380
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:58,240
如果公爵的儿子还活着的话 厄崔迪家族一个也别想活
If the Duke's son lives. No Atreides will live.

381
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,320
大人 你向女巫保证过 而且她明察秋毫
My Lord, you gave your word to the witch. And she sees too much.

382
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,450
我说过我不会伤害他们 我当然不会伤害
I said I would not harm them. And I shall not.

383
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,120
但是厄拉科斯毕竟是厄拉科斯
But Arrakis is Arrakis,

384
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,330
沙漠总是会消灭弱者
and the desert takes the weak.

385
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,840
我的沙漠
My desert.

386
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,800
我的厄拉科斯
My Arrakis.

387
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,560
我的沙丘
My dune.

388
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,720
这是你第一次战略会议
Your first strategy meeting.

389
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:34,320
保罗厄崔迪 他赤手空拳抓到猎镖 堪比所有人的英雄
Paul Atreides, who catches hunter seekers in his bare hands like a hero of all.

390
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,440
谢谢你的羞辱 老头 我会看着你的
Thanks for the humiliation, old man. I'll keep an eye on you.

391
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,610
起立
Attention!

392
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,000
开始吧
Let's get started.

393
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,670
苏菲尔 行动组
Thufir, operations.

394
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,170
我弄到了一份哈科宁家族的账簿
I've secured a copy of the Harkonnen's account books.

395
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:04,510
哈科宁家族每年从这里赚取100亿索拉利斯币
The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion solaris out of here every year.

396
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,930
他们不仅吸食丰富的海产
"They shall suck at the abundance of the seas

397
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,800
还有藏在沙子里的宝藏
and on the treasures hidden in the sand."

398
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,220
我们暂时无法取得这样的利润
We won't see profits like that for a while,

399
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,410
他们没有给我们留下设备
not with the equipment they left us.

400
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,980
情况到底如何
How bad is it?

401
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,730
这些是香料仓
These are spice silos.

402
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,840
我们得装满所有的板条箱
We are meant to fill every crate.

403
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,330
所有的吗
All of them?

404
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,370
每隔25个标准日就得装满一次
Every 25 standard days.

405
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,870
哈科宁的破坏让我们节奏慢了许多
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

406
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,370
谁负责维护呢
But who's meant to arbitrate?

407
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,040
不是有变时裁决官来负责移交吗
Isn't there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition?

408
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:44,390
皇帝任命了谁 列特·凯恩斯博士 帝国生态学家
Who did the Emperor appoint? Dr. Liet Kynes, imperial ecologist.

409
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,720
在这里经呆了20年了 据我所知 性情古怪
Been here 20 years. Eccentric from what I'm told.

410
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,410
我想亲眼看看那些要收割的田地
I want to see these harvesting fields myself.

411
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,220
我不推荐这样做 大人
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

412
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,250
让这位变时裁决官陪我们一起去吧
Have this Judge of the Change accompany us.

413
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,910
我们的会议本来已经延误了
Our meeting is long overdue.

414
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,110
我们需要得到一点帝国的保护
And we'll get a bit of imperial protection.

415
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,640
这算人质吗 我喜欢
A hostage? I love it.

416
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,280
他来了 大人
He's here, my lord

417
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,220
照顾好他们 他们是朋友
Take care of them, they are friends.

418
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,770
邓肯 我的好小子
Duncan! My boy!

419
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,030
你肯定又长高了 好吧 你闻着更臭了
I swear you're getting taller. Well, you smell much worse.

420
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
我和弗里曼人一起住了四周
For four weeks I've lived with the Fremen,

421
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,960
他们躲在沙漠中的一个部落 称之为穴地
hidden in the desert, in the community called the sietch.

422
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,080
那个穴地的领导者 史蒂加 已经和我一起来见你了 先生
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch has come with me to meet you, sir.

423
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,960
穴地 他们是怎么躲起来的 躲在地下
This sietch, how was it hidden? It's under ground.

424
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,940
厄拉科斯到处都是洞穴
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

425
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,230
那地方有多大
How big was the place?

426
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,760
那里有上万人 而且有几百个穴地
It's a ten thousand people, and there are hundreds of sietches.

427
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,220
数百万的弗里曼人 你猜对了
Millions of Fremen. You were right.

428
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:14,230
据哈科宁估计 这整个星球上只有5万人
The Harkonnen estimate was fifty thousand on the whole planet.

429
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,850
弗里曼人看着我找了好几天 我一直没找到
The Fremen watched me search for them for days. I never saw them.

430
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,550
最后 他们派了一个勇士来杀我
Finally, they sent a warrior out to kill me,

431
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,590
我得说 我从未如此接近死亡
and I have to tell you, I've never come so close to dying.

432
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,410
帝国没有比他更厉害的战士了
There's no finer fighter in the Imperium.

433
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,700
他们像恶魔一样战斗 这就是沙漠力量
They fight like demons. Desert power.

434
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:37,250
邓肯 干得好 谢谢您 大人
Duncan, well done. Thank you, my lord.

435
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,340
长官 他们的首领有一把刀 他不愿意缴械 长官
Sir, their leader has a knife he won't surrender, sir.

436
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,290
那是晶牙匕 对他们来说非常神圣
It's a crysknife, it's sacred to his people.

437
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,090
让他进来吧
Let him pass.

438
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,020
站住别动
Stop there.

439
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,430
嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey!

440
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:14,160
史蒂加 欢迎你
Stilgar, welcome.

441
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:20,580
先生 我很尊重那些愿意尊重我的人
Sir, I respect the personal dignity of any man that respects mine.

442
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,260
等一下
Hold.

443
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,790
谢谢你 史蒂加 谢谢来自你体液的厚礼
Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture.

444
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,810
我们会接受你的馈赠 并予以回礼
We accept it in the spirit in which it was given.

445
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,780
我很高兴你能来
I'm glad you've come.

446
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,700
我相信你的人民和我趵人民可以相互提供很多东西
I believe your people and mine have much to offer one another.

447
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,600
你们是外来者 你们来这里是为了香料
You are outworlders, you come here for the spice,

448
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,100
你们拿走香料 却不给任何回报
You take it, giving nothing in return.

449
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:59,770
说得对
That's true.

450
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,620
我知道你们在哈科宁的手下受了很多苦
I know you've suffered at the hands of the Harkonnen.

451
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,170
你可以尽管提要求
Name what you want.

452
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,580
只要是我力所能及的 我会无偿给予
If it's in my power to grant I'll give it and ask for nothing.

453
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,280
我就一要求: 不要再搜寻其他的穴地部落 不要侵入我们的土地
I ask for this: do not seek our sietches, do not trespass in our lands.

454
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,710
在你们来这之前 沙漠本是属于我们的
The desert was ours long before you came.

455
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,370
然后你们来了 挖掘香料
So, come and dig your spice,

456
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:25,130
等你们挖完香料 又回到屏蔽墙的这一边来
but when you have it, go back to this side of the shield wall

457
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,850
只把一片沙漠留给弗里曼人
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

458
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,780
你要称呼公爵为 "大人" 或 "先生"
You will address the Duke as "my lord," or "sir."

459
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,280
格尼 别 不用讲这些
Gurney, just... Just a moment.

460
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:38,240
皇帝给了我厄拉科斯作为我的领地 我要负责统治和保护
The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief to rule and protect.

461
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:43,880
只要上面不要求 我们不会去沙漠乱闯
I cannot promise not to travel into the desert if duty compels me.

462
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,210
你们的穴地部落永远属于你们
But your sietches will be yours forever.

463
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,560
在我统治这里期间 你们绝不会遭遇猎杀
and you will never be hunted while I govern here.

464
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,010
真是冠冕堂皇啊
That's very honorable.

465
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,340
我得走了
I must go.

466
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,800
我该说的都说了
That's all I have to say to you.

467
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,060
你为什么不留下来呢 我们予你荣誉
Why don't you stay. We would honor you.

468
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,150
我的荣誉要求我到别的地方去
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

469
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,790
我不喜欢他 我们的计划会结出硕果
I don't like him. Our plan bears fruit.

470
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,240
只是还需要时间
But it will take time.

471
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:26,630
是的 还需要时间
Yes. It will take time.

472
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,050
给 这是给你的
Here, this is for you.

473
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,180
这是个定位罗盘
It's a paracompass.

474
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,560
这里的卫星有磁场 所以普通的指南针不会指向北方
The moons here have a magnetic field, so a simple compass needle won't point north.

475
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,800
需要这个精密的仪器才行
Takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out.

476
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,150
这是弗里曼人做的吗
Do Fremen make these?

477
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,900
还有蒸馏服 沙压器还有各种巧妙的玩意儿
And stillsuits, and sand compactors, and all kinds of ingenious things.

478
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,190
沙压器是什么
What the hell is a sand compactor?

479
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,090
沙压器就是沙压器
That's a sand compactor.

480
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,690
天啊 伙计 你真像是这土生土长的人
My God, man, you've gone native.

481
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,590
你很钦佩他们
You admire them.

482
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,040
没错
I do.

483
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,430
他们很勇猛 也很忠诚
They're fierce but loyal.

484
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,310
他们在沙漠里 这些都是一小部分
They're tuned into the desert, part of it, it's part of them.

485
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,710
等你有机会到外面见到
You wait till you see it.

486
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,760
你就会见到他们的美
It's beautiful out there.

487
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,930
日出警报
Sunrise warning.

488
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,230
...气温即将升至140度 现在的温度是90度
...The temperature up to 140 degrees. The temperature now is 90 degrees.

489
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:29,770
十分钟后将上升50度
But it will rise 50 degrees in ten minutes.

490
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,480
最后一次警告
Last warning.

491
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,890
变时裁决官 先生
The Judge of the Change, sir.

492
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,640
列特·凯恩斯博士
Dr. Liet Kynes.

493
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,480
公爵大人 欢迎来到厄拉科斯
My Lord, Duke, welcome to Arrakis.

494
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,490
你就是帝国生态学家
You are the imperial ecologist.

495
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,650
谢谢你的蒸馏服
Thank you for the stillsuits.

496
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,910
这是弗里曼人制作的最好的东西
They are Fremen make, the best.

497
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,450
如果您允许 先生 我必须检查一下是否穿戴完整
With your permission, sir, I must check the integrity

498
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,870
没事的
It's all right.

499
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,120
没事的
It's all right.

500
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,420
凯恩斯博士 悉听尊便
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

501
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:43,220
蒸馏服是一种很高效的过滤系统
A stillsuit is a high efficiency filtration system.

502
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:45,180
即使是在早晨
Even this early in the morning

503
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,660
没有蒸馏服你也活不了两个小时
you wouldn't survive two hours without one of these.

504
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:53,830
它能使身体降温 并回收因汗而流失的水分
It cools the body and recycles the water lost to sweat.

505
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,280
而且只需身体运动就能提供动能
Your bodies movements provide the power.

506
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,950
在口罩里面 你会发现一根管子 能让您饮用回收的水分
Inside the mask you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.

507
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,370
只要正常使用 你的蒸馏服一天只会消耗很少一部分水
In good working order your suit won't lose more than a thimble full of water a day.

508
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,370
真是厉害
Most impressive.

509
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,880
让我检查下你的 小伙子
Let's have a look at you, lad.

510
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,420
你以前穿过蒸馏服吗 没有 这是我第一次穿
You've worn a stillsuit before? No, this is my first time.

511
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,600
你的沙漠靴子穿在脚上非常贴合 谁教你的
Your desert boots off at a slip fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that?

512
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,310
感觉就该这么穿啊
It seemed the right way.

513
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,110
你是弗里曼人吗
Are you a Fremen?

514
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,640
我被地穴和村庄接纳
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

515
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,790
好了
Now.

516
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:47,660
来看看你们赖以生存的香料沙地吧
Come and see the spice sands on which your livelihood depends.

517
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,580
如果你的扑翼飞机坠落在这里你会怎么做
What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here?

518
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,370
你不会想去那里的 这是沙虫的领地
You wouldn't want to go down out there. It's worm territory.

519
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,050
尘埃云
Dust cloud.

520
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,960
我看到了
I see it.

521
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,720
那是你们的一辆收割机
That's one of your harvesters.

522
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,290
你可以看到香料散落在表面上
You can see the spice scattered over the surface.

523
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:15,660
形成一个色泽丰富的香料床
Rich spice bed by the color.

524
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,350
飞高一点的话 你会看得更清楚
If you get a little higher you'll have a better view.

525
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,600
你看到这些侦察机在寻找沙虫的迹象
You see these spotter aircraft looking for worm sign.

526
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,020
怎么找沙虫的迹象
Worm sign?

527
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,340
只需要找向爬行器移动的沙浪就行
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

528
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:45,070
沙虫虽然潜伏的很深 但当它们要发动攻击时会逐渐浮到地面
Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack.

529
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,280
如果你们有耐心 我们可以去看看
If you are patient we should see one.

530
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:54,580
沙虫老是来吗 是的 因为它们总是被有节奏的声音所吸引
Worm always comes? Always, they're drawn by rhythmic noises.

531
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,780
为什么我们不直接用屏蔽场呢
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

532
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,660
沙漠中用屏蔽场就是找死
A shield is a death sentence in the desert.

533
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,170
会吸引沙虫 驱使它们疯狂杀戮
It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.

534
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,970
那是条沙虫吗
Is that a worm?

535
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,700
是个大家伙
Big one.

536
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,780
你眼神真好
You have good eyes.

537
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,700
呼叫DA9号 沙虫信号警告 请确认
Calling crawler Delta Ajax 9. Worm sign warning. Acknowledge.

538
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,530
谁在呼叫DA9号呢 完毕
Who calls Delta Ajax 9? Over.

539
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,750
他们似乎对此相当平静 这里是未登记的帝国业务飞行器
They seem pretty calm about it. Unlisted flight, Imperium business.

540
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:41,210
沙虫位于你的东北方向 三点七公里
Worm sign, north and east of you. 3.7 kilometers.

541
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,500
DA9号 这里是侦察机1号 已确认发现沙虫
Delta Ajax 9, this is Spotter 1, worm sighting confirmed.

542
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,670
等待修复通讯
Standby for contact fix.

543
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:55,970
沙虫正在向你的位置袭来 五分钟后到达
Worm is on intercept course to your position. Contact in five minutes.

544
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,140
那么现在该怎么做
So what happens now?

545
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,240
他们会叫大型运载机去回收香料机车
They'll call the carryall to lift the crawler.

546
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,730
他们会采收到最后一刻
They'll harvest right up to the last minute.

547
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,860
呼叫A0号运载机 准备好停靠
Calling carryall Alfa Zero. Ready to docking sequence.

548
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,860
五分钟后到达 完毕
Contact five minutes, over.

549
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,370
有人看到运载机了吗
Anybody got a visual on a carryall?

550
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,080
那就是了
There it is.

551
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:25,000
这是去往DA9号的A0号运载机
This is carryall Alfa Zero to Delta Ajax 9.

552
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,920
从您的东面靠近
Approaching from your east.

553
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,140
更正高度并准备停靠和抓握
Correcting altitude and preparing docking and gripping.

554
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:33,640
收到 A0号运载机 正在启动停靠序列
Copy, Alpha Zero. Initiating docking sequence.

555
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:38,310
T 5 收到
T 5. Copy that.

556
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,710
准备在30秒内升空 停靠序列已启动
Prepare to be airborne in 30 seconds. Docking sequence initiated.

557
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,180
请停靠
Brace yourselves.

558
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,570
A0号 有一个支点未连接
Alpha Zero, we are short on one point of contact.

559
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,990
怎么回事 是其中一个锚故障了
What is going on? It's one of the anchors. It's dead.

560
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:54,620
他妈的
Shit.

561
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,580
运载机 无法继续 这锚不连接上无法升空
Carryall, unable to proceed. Unable to lift without that anchor.

562
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,540
所有人员请注意
All call. All call.

563
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,920
此区所有运载机请回复
Any carryall in the sector, please respond.

564
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,640
侦察机1号 请报告最新消息 完毕
Spotter 1, give us an update. Over.

565
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,380
液压系统故障 我们赶不上了 你们必须撤离
Hydraulics are dead. We won't make it. You have to evacuate.

566
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,420
那辆机车上有多少人 21个
How many men on that crawler? Crawler of 21.

567
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:16,140
我们的飞船每艘可以载六个 还剩三个人
Our ships can take six each. That's still three short.

568
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,720
我们会找到办法的
We'll find a way.

569
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,860
这里是莱托·厄崔迪公爵
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

570
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:35,210
我们要下来营救DA9的机组人员
We're coming down to extract the crew of Delta Ajax 9.

571
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:36,370
所有的侦查机待命行动
Sit down on the left.

572
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:50,300
每个屏蔽场发生器重100公斤
The shield generators weigh 100 kilos each.

573
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,300
是的 格尼 让我们的护卫扔掉屏蔽场发生器
Yes, Gurney, have our escort throw out the shield generators.

574
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:57,430
保罗 你到推进器后面去 带他们进去
And Paul, I want you at the back of the thopter, guide them in.

575
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:01,430
DA9号 往我们的飞船上各派7个人
Delta Ajax 9, put seven men each in my ships now.

576
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,120
沙虫将于两分钟后抵达
Contact in two minutes.

577
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,250
快到了 伙计们 我们最好现在赶紧弃船
It's getting close, guys. We better abandon the ship now.

578
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,000
他们在哪里
Where are they?

579
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:12,730
先生 我们签了协议的
Sir, there is protocol for a reason,

580
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,000
如果我们离开这 我们就得死
if we take one step out we're as good as dead.

581
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:18,010
另外 我们已经装满了香料 我们不能就这样离开
Besides, we've got full load of spice, we can't just leave

582
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,760
去他妈的香料 我命令所有人马上从那艘飞船里面出来
Damn the spice! I want every man off that crawler now!

583
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,120
这边七个 那边七个
Seven over here, seven over there!

584
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,910
快快快
Run, run!

585
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:03,890
救世主
Kwisatz Haderach.

586
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,530
救世主苏醒了
Kwisatz Haderach awakes.

587
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,870
快点 上车
Hurry! Get on!

588
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:41,220
沙虫来了
It's here!

589
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:44,050
保罗
Paul!

590
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,760
保罗
Paul!

591
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:55,020
我能辨认出你的脚步声 老头
I recognize your footsteps, old man.

592
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:58,320
快起来 我们走吧
Get up. Let's go.

593
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,450
你怎么了 快点 赶紧跑
What's wrong with you? Come on. Let's go.

594
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:03,950
跑啊
Run!

595
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:54,210
赞美造物主与他的水 赞美他翻来覆去
"Bless the Maker and His water. Bless the coming and going of Him.

596
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:59,590
愿他所到之处 净化大地 为民护地
May His passage cleanse the world. And keep the world for His people."

597
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:26,740
嘿 你不能冒这样的风险 是的 先生
Hey, you cannot take such risks. Yes, sir.

598
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:30,450
你身负重任 对不起 先生 这种事不会再发生了
You do have responsibilities. I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

599
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,080
凯恩斯博士
Dr. Kynes.

600
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,500
你亲眼看到了吧
You saw it with your own eyes.

601
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,370
很明显 他们留给我们的都是些残次品
It's plain to see. Everything they've left us is in shambles.

602
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:41,920
我们这样肯定会失败的
We've been set up to fail.

603
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,630
那辆车只是太旧了 沙漠对设备损坏程度很高
That carryall was just old. The desert isn't kind to equipment.

604
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:53,310
你知道如果我不能让香料生产重回正轨 会有什么后果吗
You know what will happen if I don't get spice production back on track?

605
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:59,560
我不是来跟你换位思考的
I'm not here to take your part.

606
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:04,820
厄拉科斯有很多像你这样的人来来去去
Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.

607
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:09,780
好好照顾你的家人吧
Take good care of your family.

608
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,500
沙漠对人类也很不友好
The desert's not kind to humans either.

609
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:38,810
香料是一种具有精神活性的化学物质 看来你很敏感
Spice is a psychoactive chemical. You seem to be sensitive.

610
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,780
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

611
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,610
谢谢你 岳医生
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

612
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,620
这不是过敏反应
It wasn't an allergic reaction.

613
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,490
我当时看到了一个场景
I had a vision.

614
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,830
我的眼睛睁得大大的
My eyes were wide open.

615
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,140
你看到了什么
What did you see?

616
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:51,970
救世主
Kwisatz Haderach...

617
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,140
您可以看到
You can see.

618
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,560
我也不清楚 我以为我看到了我之死 但并非如此
It's confusing, I thought I saw my death, only it wasn't.

619
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:46,100
我不知道为什么 好像有一把刀很重要
I know a knife is important somehow.

620
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,690
有人会给我一把刀
Someone will hand me a blade.

621
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,200
但我不知道谁会给我 也不知道什么时候会在哪给我
But I don't know who or when or where.

622
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:01,410
但我又感觉 冥冥之中一切已注定
Some things though are crystal clear. I can feel it.

623
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:06,940
我知道你怀孕了
I know you're pregnant.

624
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:16,340
你不可能知道的
You can't know that.

625
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:19,720
我也是刚知道 而且才过了几个星期
I barely know that and it's only been few weeks.

626
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:14,190
厄崔迪的军团是帝国中最优秀的
Atreides legions are the finest in the Imperium.

627
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,900
是由格尼·哈莱克和邓肯·爱达荷精心训练的
Trained by Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho.

628
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,750
正是如此
Just so.

629
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:30,540
按照旨意 要三个营的人
Three battalions as agreed.

630
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,460
有些关于保罗的事你必须知道
There's something you need to know about Paul.

631
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:17,300
不 我觉得我不想知道
No. I don't think I wanna know.

632
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,900
自从你把他带到你尊敬的圣母那去之后
Ever since you brought him before your Reverend Mother

633
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:21,800
他变了
he hasn't been the same.

634
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:26,470
他心烦意乱
He's distracted.

635
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,890
杰西卡 你给我生了个儿子
Jessica, you gave me a son.

636
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:33,270
从他出生的那一刻起我就没有质疑过你
And from the moment he was born I never questioned you.

637
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,900
我完全信任你 即使你暗度陈仓
I trusted you completely, even when you walked in shadows.

638
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:42,240
现在我只问你一件事
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

639
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:48,330
如果发生什么事 你会保护我们的儿子吗
If anything happens, will you protect our son?

640
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,500
我会用我的性命保护他
With my life.

641
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:55,670
我不是在问你 我是在问贝内·格塞里特家族
I'm not asking his mother, I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

642
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,420
你们会保护保罗吗
Will you protect Paul?

643
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,100
你为什么会有这些想法
Why are you having these thoughts?

644
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,520
莱托 你以前可不这样
Leto, this is not you.

645
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:25,240
我以为我们会有更多时间
I thought we'd have more time.

646
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:48,260
晚安 保罗少爷 晚安 岳医生
Have a good night, Master Paul. Good night, Dr. Yueh.

647
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,940
你需要休息一下
You need to sleep.

648
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:04,700
不 不要那个
No, not like that.

649
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:22,300
我真该娶你为妻的
I should have married you.

650
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,630
哈瓦特 安保
Hawat. Security.

651
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,670
安保
Security!

652
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,650
先生 先生
Sir. Sir.

653
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,740
屏蔽场被关闭了
The shield's come down.

654
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,370
上帝啊
God in Heaven.

655
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,880
所有带炮的飞行器全部升空 快
Get everything with guns off the ground! Go!

656
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,240
跟我来
With me!

657
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:27,600
厄崔迪
Atreides!

658
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,550
萨督卡
Sardaukar!

659
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:24,370
我很抱歉 大人
I'm sorry, my lord.

660
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,410
但我已经和男爵达成了协议
But I've made a bargain with the Baron.

661
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,130
为什么 我别无选择
Why? I had no choice.

662
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,630
哈科宁人抓走了我的妻子 万娜
The Harkonners have my wife, Wanna.

663
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,360
他们要把她像洋娃娃一样肢解
They take her apart like a doll.

664
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,680
我得救她 而你就是他们开的条件
I will buy her freedom and you are the price.

665
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:53,560
我会尽可能把这交给保罗
For Paul. I will do what I can.

666
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,940
你得为我杀一个人
And you will kill a man for me.

667
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:06,120
我要给你换颗钉牙
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

668
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,160
只要你用力一咬 这颗牙就会碎掉
If you bite them hard, this tooth will crash.

669
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:15,330
你只需要吐一口气 空气中就会充满毒气
Breathe out, and you will fill the air with poison.

670
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,470
这也是你最后一口气
It will be your last breath.

671
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,650
但只要你选对了时机
But if you choose your moment well

672
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:24,050
你可以拉男爵陪葬
it will also be the Baron's.

673
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,770
保罗
Paul.

674
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,730
见鬼去吧 狗杂种
To hell, dogs!

675
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:03,040
我没操过贵族呢
I've never had a high born.

676
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:07,750
你呢 贝内·格瑟里特家族的也不全是贵族
You? Bene Gesserit ain't no high born.

677
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,880
她出生高贵 我配不上她
She is high born enough for me.

678
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:16,140
我们把这孩子喂给沙虫吃 让他们母子诀别
Let's feed the kid to the worms and give her a long goodbye.

679
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,470
你们不准碰我妈妈
Don't you dare touch my mother.

680
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,270
别说话
Don't talk.

681
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,400
把她嘴上的布取下来
Remove her gag.

682
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,330
闭嘴
Shut up.

683
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:15,650
把她嘴上的布拿开
Remove her gag.

684
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,870
杀了他
Kill him.

685
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:33,500
还我们自由
Set us free.

686
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:48,230
停 把绳子剪断
Stop. Cut the rope.

687
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,770
把刀给我
Give me the knife.

688
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,240
你用密语有点用力过猛了
Your pitch was too forced.

689
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,710
是弗里曼人的工具包
It's a Fremkit.

690
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:27,850
他们把船弄坏了
They've crippled the ship.

691
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:07,280
你的厨房真不错 表弟
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

692
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,050
这是岳医生的笔迹
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

693
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:32,520
"如果有人活着离开了厄拉科斯 工具包里有厄崔迪的信标
"If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive there's an Atreides beacon in the Fremkit.

694
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,840
上帝保佑他们能找到你"
God willing they'd be able to find you."

695
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:46,160
伯爵大人 这是岳医生
Milord Baron, Dr. Yueh.

696
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,770
那个叛徒?
The traitor?

697
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,100
你想要什么
What do you want?

698
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:55,160
我干扰了他们的通讯并关闭了他们的屏蔽场
I jammed their comms and lowered their shields.

699
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:59,540
把公爵和他的家人都交给了你
I gave you Duke and his family.

700
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:04,590
谈条件就爽快点 需要我做什么
The bargain to the letter. And what was I to do for you?

701
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:08,140
把我妻子从痛苦中解救出来
Deliver my wife from her agony.

702
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,640
好
Yes.

703
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:48,090
我说我会放了她 你才能跟她团聚
I said I'd set her free, that you could join her.

704
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:53,970
那你就跟她团聚吧
So join her.

705
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,900
你觉得接下来该怎么做呢
What do you think is next?

706
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:10,280
是个沙槌
It's a thumper.

707
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:12,250
没有蒸馏服
No stillsuits.

708
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,880
蒸馏服才是我们最需要的
The one thing we actually need.

709
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:23,180
几百年来 我们血债血偿
For hundreds of years we've traded blood for blood.

710
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:25,790
但以后不会再有了
But no more.

711
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:31,760
尔儿子死了 你的爱妾死了
Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead.

712
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:35,010
今晚厄崔迪家族陨落...
Tonight the house Atreides falls...

713
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:40,270
你的血统就会永远终结
and your bloodline ends forever.

714
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:56,450
您说什么
What did you say?

715
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:09,380
"我在这里 我还在这里"
"Here I am, here I remain!"

716
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:57,030
凯恩斯 你不该来这
Kynes! It's not safe for you here.

717
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,340
你能说说帝国和兰斯拉德的各大家族是怎么背叛我们的吗
Will you tell the Great House of the Landsraad how we were betrayed?

718
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,920
他们为何要这般谋杀
How the best of them were murdered?

719
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:07,790
我奉命闭口不谈 视若不见
I am commanded to say nothing, to see nothing.

720
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:12,170
皇帝把我们送到这里是来送死的
The Emperor sent us here to die.

721
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,930
罐子里有香料
Spice in the tank.

722
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:31,110
这就是未来 就要来了
That's the future. It's coming.

723
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:49,330
圣战正像一团无法熄灭的大火一样席卷整个宇宙
The Holy war is spreading across the universe like an unquenchable fire.

724
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:07,890
保罗 你很害怕 我看得出来 请告诉我 你在害怕什么
Paul, you're scared. I can see it. Tell me, please, what do you fear?

725
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:22,440
谁来帮帮我 拜托 保罗...
Somebody help me, please. Paul...

726
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:25,130
要来了
It's coming.

727
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:29,180
圣战正像一团无法熄灭的大火一样席卷整个宇宙
The Holy war is spreading across the universe like an unquenchable fire.

728
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:34,500
一好战宗教 高举厄崔迪的战旗
A warrior religion that waves the Atreides banner in my father's name.

729
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:39,460
狂战军团 在我父亲遗骸的圣殿中膜拜
Fanatical legions worshiping at the shine of my father's skull.

730
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:43,840
他们以我的名义 每个人都高呼我的名字
A war in my name! Everyone shouting my name!

731
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:45,050
保罗
Paul.

732
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,810
保罗·厄崔迪...
Paul Atreides...

733
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:54,160
你是你父亲的儿子 也是我的儿子
You are your father's son. You are my son.

734
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,500
你是保罗·厄崔迪公爵
You are Duke Paul Atreides.

735
01:40:57,850 --> 01:41:00,640
你知道你是谁
You know who you are.

736
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:03,490
放开我
Get off me!

737
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:08,280
是你把我弄成这样的 你的贝内·格塞里特让我成了怪胎
You did this to me! Your Bene Gesserit made me a freak!

738
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:35,430
我爸爸死了
My dad is dead.

739
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:14,100
有人在附近
Someone is near.

740
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,060
你需要喝点水
You need to drink.

741
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:20,350
这是帐篷里的循环水
It's recycled water from the tent.

742
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,950
回收的汗水和泪水
Sweat and tears.

743
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,620
好了 快离开这
All right. Let's get out of here.

744
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:49,690
是邓肯
It's Duncan.

745
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:02,000
夫人 保罗...
My Lady. Paul...

746
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:06,130
我很抱歉 你父亲... 我们知道
I'm so sorry... Your father... We know.

747
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,380
公爵大人
My Lord Duke.

748
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,910
给
Here.

749
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,520
把这个喝了
Drink this.

750
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:38,490
哈科宁人一下子袭击了我们星球上所有的人口聚集地
The Harkonnens hit every population center on the planet at once.

751
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:41,050
起码有十个军团 上百艘战船
It must've been ten legions, hundreds of ships.

752
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,860
萨督卡和他们在一起
There were Sardaukar with them.

753
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:45,870
至少有两个营 你确定吗
At least two battalions. Are you sure?

754
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:49,460
我和萨督卡交过手 你知道的
You cross swords with the Sardaukar, you know it.

755
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,970
所以 皇帝已经站队了
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

756
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:57,340
变时裁决官有什么要说的吗
What says the Judge of the Change?

757
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,280
皇帝根本不给我发言权
The Emperor forbids me from saying anything at all.

758
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:03,430
但是你冒着生命危险来帮助我们
Yet you risk your life to help us.

759
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,250
沙暴就要来了
The storm is coming.

760
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:43,390
沙暴几个小时后就到了 我们在这里会比较安全
The storm will be here in a few hours. We'll be safe here.

761
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:47,940
你知道这是什么地方吗 这是一个古老的生态试验站
Do you know what this place is? It's an old ecological testing station.

762
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:53,570
他们本来是要控制这个星球
The were meant to tame the planet

763
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,130
把藏在沙子下的水找出来
and free the water locked beneath the sands.

764
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:01,030
厄拉科斯本可以成为天堂
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

765
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:04,720
正当百废待兴之时 他们却发现了香料
The work had begun but then the spice was discovered.

766
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:07,600
一时间 他们都不希望消除沙漠了
and suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away.

767
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:10,590
塔纳特 你能找一套适合我们的蒸馏服吗
Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors.

768
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:11,730
好的 列特
Yes, Liet.

769
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:14,710
沙米尔 来几杯咖啡 好的 列特
Shamir, coffee service, please. Of course, Liet.

770
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:20,090
你是弗里曼人的什么人
Who are you to the Fremen?

771
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:12,310
你知道大家族最害怕什么吗 凯恩斯博士
Do you know what the great houses fear most, Dr. Kynes?

772
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,650
就是这儿所发生的一切
Exactly what has happened to us here.

773
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:19,820
萨督卡来了 一个接一个地把他们干掉
The Sardaukar coming and picking them off one by one.

774
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:26,700
只有齐心协力 才有机会对抗帝国
Only together can they stand a chance against the Imperium.

775
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:29,630
你愿意作证吗
Would you bare witness?

776
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,360
证明皇帝在这里对我们采取了行动
Testify that the Emperor has moved against us here.

777
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:36,050
如果他们相信我的话...
If they believe me...

778
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:40,450
大家族们和皇帝之间将会开启一场全面的战争
There would be general warfare between the great houses and the Emperor.

779
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:43,590
整个帝国都会混乱
Chaos across the Imperium.

780
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,970
但如果我给皇帝一个混乱之外的选择呢
Let's suppose I present to the Emperor with an alternative to chaos.

781
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:51,680
皇帝没有儿子 他的女儿们还没有结婚
And the Emperor has no sons, and his daughters are yet to marry.

782
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:54,640
你要在皇帝面前玩把戏吗
You'd make a play for the throne?

783
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:58,500
皇帝畏惧厄崔迪家族 他把你们带到这里来是为了杀你们
The Emperor feared the Atreides. He brought you here to kill you.

784
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:00,520
你还不明白吗
What don't you understand?

785
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:04,110
你是个无家可归的孩子 躲在地穴里
You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground.

786
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:11,870
弗里曼人称我为救世主
The Fremen speak of the Lisan al Gaib.

787
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,660
小心
Careful.

788
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:17,420
能将他们带到天堂的异域先知
The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to paradise.

789
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:19,960
都是迷信
Superstition.

790
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:29,220
我知道你爱过一个弗里曼战士 却在战争中失去了他
I know you loved a Fremen warrior and lost him in battle.

791
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:34,810
我知道你生活在两个世界 有很多人都知道你的名字
I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names.

792
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:41,980
我知道你的梦想
I've seen your dream.

793
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:47,770
要是当了皇帝 凯恩斯博士
As Emperor, Dr. Kynes,

794
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:51,050
只要挥挥手 我就能为厄拉科斯打造一个天堂
I could make a paradise for Arrakis with the wave of my hand.

795
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,460
你真的认为他会是救世主吗
Do you really think he could be the Mahdi?

796
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,420
他看起来很年轻
He looks very young.

797
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:49,150
萨督卡
Sardaukar!

798
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:54,910
不 邓肯 保罗 不
No! Duncan! Paul, no!

799
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:02,420
邓肯 不 他锁上门了
Duncan, no! He's locked the door.

800
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,840
他死了
He's gone.

801
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,450
邓肯
Duncan!

802
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:56,240
我偏得走了 我们别无选择
We have to go. We have no choice.

803
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:06,150
保罗 快跑
Paul, run!

804
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:27,080
快点 快点
Come on, come on!

805
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:01,890
跟着光走 你会发现一台沙漠版的扑翼飞机
Follow the light. You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

806
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,190
外面的沙暴是你最好的逃离的机会
That storm out there is your best shot.

807
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:09,040
沙暴足足有5000米高 大部分是沙尘 飞进去后 留在沙暴上方
Above 5000 meters, it's mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top.

808
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,270
沙暴结束后 向南走 能找到弗里曼人 你不和我们一起去吗
Head south. Find the Fremen. You're not coming with us?

809
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,590
飞机只有两个座位
It only sits two.

810
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:17,290
我去下一站 向兰斯拉德各大家族报告这次袭击
I'll go to the next station and report this attack to the Landsraad.

811
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:19,220
你怎么去
How?

812
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:22,420
我是弗里曼人 沙漠是我的家
I'm Fremen. The desert is my home.

813
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,690
祝你们好运 祝你好运
Good luck. Good luck.

814
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:07,010
凯恩斯 你背叛了皇帝
Kynes, you have betrayed the emperor.

815
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:09,120
我只服侍一位主人
I serve only one master.

816
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:12,790
他就是 沙虫
His name is Shai Hulud.

817
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,500
我们身后有飞行器
There are jet flyers behind us.

818
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,230
保罗 我们不够高
Paul, we are not high enough!

819
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:11,350
我不能 害怕 恐惧是心灵杀手
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

820
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:14,970
恐惧只会带来毁灭
Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.

821
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:23,690
看啊 朋友
See the friend.

822
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:36,660
生命的谜团并不是需要解决的问题
The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve.

823
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:41,170
现实的体验才是
But a reality to experience.

824
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:49,220
这是一个无法暂停来理解的过程
A process that cannot be understand by stopping it.

825
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:52,720
我们必须跟随其前行
We must move with the flow of the process.

826
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:56,560
我们必须加入 随其前行
We must join it. We must float with it.

827
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:36,420
他还没有完全痊愈
He hasn't fully healed yet.

828
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:51,860
我们追赶他们进入了科里奥利风暴
We chased them into a Coriolis storm.

829
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,200
风速是每小时800公里
Wind's at 800 kilometers an hour.

830
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:02,830
没有人能在这样的风暴中幸存下来
Nothing survives such a storm.

831
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,420
他们必死无疑
They're dead. It's a certainty.

832
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:18,430
所以终于结束了
So it's done finally.

833
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:24,440
传话给吉迪主星 开始出售我们储备的香料
Send word to Giedi Prime to begin selling our spice reserves.

834
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:28,570
不过慢点卖 我们不希望价格下跌
But slowly. We don't want the price to fall.

835
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:33,700
你不知道我把这样一支军队带过去花了多少钱
You have no idea how much it cost me to bring such a force to barrier.

836
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:37,660
现在我只有一个要求 赚钱
Now I only have one requirement. Income.

837
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:42,540
拉邦 所以压榨 使劲压榨
So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard.

838
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:43,920
是的 叔叔
Yes, uncle.

839
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:46,660
弗里曼人怎么处理
And the Fremen?

840
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,170
把他们都杀了
Kill them all.

841
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:14,360
我们在5000米以上
We're above 5000 meters.

842
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:56,090
一旦着陆 就会击毁在岩石上
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

843
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:49,870
用这个呼吸
You breathe with this.

844
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:21,460
现在我们必须找到弗里曼人
Now we have to find the Fremen.

845
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,990
你还好吗 是的
Are you good? Yeah.

846
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:34,560
保罗
Paul...

847
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:44,070
不要害怕
Don't be frightened.

848
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:49,070
即使是一只小小的沙漠老鼠也能存活
Even a little desert mouse can survive.

849
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:55,870
你需要面对你的恐惧
You'll need to face your fears.

850
02:06:56,040 --> 02:07:00,500
朋友会帮助你的
A friend will help you.

851
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:04,000
跟随你的朋友
Follow the friend.

852
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:07,910
你有很多东西要学
You have much to learn.

853
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,390
我会指引你沙漠里的道路
And I will show you the ways of the desert.

854
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:16,350
跟我来吧
Come with me.

855
02:07:44,210 --> 02:07:47,710
穴地 邓肯曾经住过
The sietch, where Duncan lived.

856
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:49,970
就在这的某个地方
Somewhere off that way.

857
02:07:52,610 --> 02:07:54,820
我能看到那边的绿色
I can see the green over there.

858
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:56,300
那里
There.

859
02:07:56,550 --> 02:07:58,340
这意味着弗里曼人住在那
That means Fremen live there.

860
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:07,940
我们得在天黑后过河 弗里曼人就是这么做的
We'll cross after dark. That's how the Fremen do it.

861
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:12,240
我们即将进入沙虫领域
We're about to enter worm territory.

862
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,860
我们绝不能像普通人那样走路 否则我们就死定了
We can't walk like regular humans, if we do we're dead.

863
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:19,580
我们得像弗里曼人那样走路 这叫沙子漫步
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do. It's called the sand walk.

864
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:21,890
至少视频资料和书上是这样说的
At least according to the film books back home.

865
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:24,070
嗯 好的 我明白
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it.

866
02:08:24,210 --> 02:08:27,630
好的 跟我来 做同样的动作
Okay, follow me. Do the same moves.

867
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:42,280
我认为是这个方向
I think this is the right direction.

868
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,810
就在附近 我们赶紧走
It's close by. Let's get out of here.

869
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:12,150
等等
Wait.

870
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:15,440
这是沙鼓
It's drum sand.

871
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:20,820
跑
Run!

872
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:28,750
快 快
Go! Go!

873
02:11:40,150 --> 02:11:41,740
这是沙槌的声音
It's a thumper.

874
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:50,120
有人在敲沙槌
Someone set off a thumper.

875
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,930
保罗 快跑
Paul, run!

876
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:24,660
它们也太大了吧 太疯狂了
How big are they? That was insane.

877
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:30,580
有人把它引走了
Someone called him.

878
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:03,240
别跑了
Do not run.

879
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:07,790
只会浪费你们的身体内的水
You will only waste your bodies water.

880
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:10,620
等一下
Hold.

881
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:18,500
史蒂加
Stilgar.

882
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:23,210
嘿 你认识我的 当你来见我父亲时 我就在那里
Hey, you know me. I was there when you came to my father's council.

883
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:25,470
这是公爵的儿子
This is the Duke's son.

884
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:29,220
你还在等什么呢 我们需要他们的水
Why are you waiting? We need their water.

885
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:32,850
这就是我跟你们说过的那个男孩 我们不能碰他
This is the boy I told you about. We can't touch him.

886
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:40,860
他们是弱者 杰米斯
They're weaklings. Jamis...

887
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:45,320
他们在沙虫的地盘上勇敢地穿梭而来
There was a brave crossing they made in the path of Shai Hulud.

888
02:13:45,490 --> 02:13:48,360
他说话和行为都不像个懦夫
He does not speak or act like a weakling.

889
02:13:49,650 --> 02:13:51,460
他的父亲也不是懦夫
Nor did his father.

890
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:54,080
是我的沙槌救了他的命
My thumper saved his life.

891
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:58,670
理性点 史蒂加 他不是救世主
Go back to reason, Stilgar. He's not The One.

892
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:02,920
我们有很多有权势的朋友
We have powerful friends.

893
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:07,430
你们帮我们离开这个星球 去卡拉丹 一定能给你们不少回报
You help us off world, to Caladan, you will be well rewarded.

894
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:12,720
除了你身体里的水 你还能提供什么回报呢
What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh.

895
02:14:16,930 --> 02:14:20,120
这个男孩很小 他可以接受我们的训练
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

896
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:22,700
他可以得到庇护
He may have sanctuary.

897
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:25,740
但是这个女人没有受过训练
But the woman isn't trained

898
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:29,930
而且年纪太大了 学不会了
and too old to learn.

899
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,780
后退 你们这些蠢货
Back, you dogs!

900
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:06,590
她会割断我的喉咙
She'll cut my throat.

901
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:16,370
你为何不说你是练过玄秘之道的女战士
Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?

902
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:18,830
我们根本也没聊几句啊
The conversation ran short.

903
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,210
冷静 女人 冷静
Peace, woman, peace.

904
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:24,650
我的错
I misjudged.

905
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:06,370
我不会让你伤害我的朋友
I would not have let you hurt my friends.

906
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:33,440
他们说你是救世主
They say you are the Mahdi.

907
02:16:34,190 --> 02:16:36,060
但你看起来不过是个小男孩
But you look like a little boy.

908
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:41,290
你选择了最艰难的上山之路 跟我来吧
You chose the hardest way up. Follow me.

909
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,260
把它给我
Give it to me.

910
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:59,910
当你证明了自己的身份 会把枪给你的
You would have your own maula pistol when you've earned it.

911
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:01,330
把它给我
Give it to me.

912
02:17:06,850 --> 02:17:11,040
查尼 你负责新来的人 注意他们在旅途中的安全
Chani, take charge of the newcomers. See that they are safe in the journey.

913
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:12,200
我们走吧
Let's go.

914
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:15,110
我不同意他们一起走
I will not have them.

915
02:17:20,450 --> 02:17:24,330
贾米斯 我已经说过了 别乱来
Jamis, I have spoken. Be still.

916
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:28,750
你虽说是个领袖 但没有最强的实力
You talk like a leader, but the strongest leads.

917
02:17:30,170 --> 02:17:32,760
她打败了你
She bested you.

918
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:35,760
我要发起挑战
I invoke the Amtal.

919
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:39,430
你不能挑战圣母 那谁能挑战
You may not challenge a sayyadina. Then who will fight in her name?

920
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:44,810
贾米斯 别乱来了 夜色将尽
Jamis, don't do this. Don't. The night is fading.

921
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:47,750
那不妨让太阳来见证这场死亡
Then the sun will witness this death.

922
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,720
她的扞卫者呢
Where is her champion?

923
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:03,700
我接受她的扞卫者
I accept her champion.

924
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:37,540
保罗·厄崔迪必须死...
Paul Atreides must die...

925
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:45,200
救世主才能得以崛起
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

926
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:53,270
不要害怕 不要抗拒
Don't be frightened. Don't resist.

927
02:18:59,510 --> 02:19:04,390
当你要取走一条性命时 你得取走自己的生命
When you take a life, you take your own.

928
02:19:36,090 --> 02:19:39,840
我不相信你是救世主
I don't believe you are the Lisan al Gaib.

929
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:42,680
但我希望你死得光荣
But I want you to die with honor.

930
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,110
这把晶牙匕是我外婆给我的
This crysknife was given to me by my great aunt.

931
02:19:59,650 --> 02:20:04,070
是由一只巨大的沙虫的一颗牙齿制成的
It's made from a tooth of Shai Hulud, the great sand worm.

932
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:07,990
如果你以此匕战败 也是莫大的荣誉
This would be a great honor if you to die holding it.

933
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:14,710
外来者在哪里
Where is the outworlder?

934
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:24,260
贾米斯是个很厉害的战士 他会很决绝的
Jamis is a good fighter. He won't let you suffer.

935
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:26,680
查尼...
Chani...

936
02:20:39,030 --> 02:20:40,110
别介意
Never mind.

937
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:39,130
愿你刀断人亡
May your knife chip and shatter.

938
02:21:45,670 --> 02:21:47,510
你要迎接我的刀锋
You should welcome my blade.

939
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:53,350
这个世界迟早会干掉你
This world will kill you.

940
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:57,560
我能帮你早点解脱
Quicker this way.

941
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:39,020
你要投降吗
Do you yield?

942
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:43,690
这个男孩不知道我们的规则
The boy does not know our rule.

943
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:47,790
我们的规则没有投降 只有死亡
There is no yielding under the Amtal rule, only death is the test of that.

944
02:22:56,330 --> 02:22:58,090
他是在耍他吗 不
Is he toying with him? No.

945
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:01,080
保罗从未杀过人
Paul has never killed a man.

946
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:16,060
救世主
Kwisatz Haderach.

947
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:22,440
救世主
Kwisatz Haderach.

948
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:26,320
爬上去 崛起吧
Climb up. Rise.

949
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:22,810
你现在是我们中的一员了 一命换一命
You're one of us now. A life for a life.

950
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:25,890
和我们一起去山脊洞穴吧 不
Come with us to Sietch Tabr. No.

951
02:25:26,060 --> 02:25:27,600
保罗需要离开这个星球
Paul needs to get off world.

952
02:25:27,710 --> 02:25:30,710
你一定有办法的 你有走私的人 你有飞船
You must have ways. You have smugglers, you have ships.

953
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:32,290
不 你有
No. You have

954
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:35,320
皇帝把我们送到这个地方
The Emperor sent us to this place.

955
02:25:36,860 --> 02:25:38,510
我父亲来了...
And my father came...

956
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:44,200
不是为了香料 也不是为了财富
Not for spice, not for the riches,

957
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:45,880
而是为了团结你们人民的力量
but for the strength of your people.

958
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:51,440
我的前途通向沙漠
My road leads into the desert.

959
02:25:54,170 --> 02:25:56,470
我看得出来
I can see it.

960
02:25:58,090 --> 02:26:02,000
如果你愿意接待我们 我们就会随你们去
If you'll have us, we will come.

961
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:52,250
沙漠力量
Desert power.

962
02:26:53,730 --> 02:26:55,300
这只是个开始
This is only the beginning.

963
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,080
梦传递着来自深处的讯息

964
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,410
沙 丘 瀚 战
上 部

965
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,390
沙 丘

966
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,390
第一部

967
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,260
公元10191年

968
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,560
卡拉丹

969
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,560
阿特雷季斯家族故土

970
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,310
吉迪主星

971
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,310
哈科宁家族故土

972
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,940
贝内格赛里特的事儿 我是略有所闻

973
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,650
他们说他们的存在 是为了要造福更多的人

974
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,900
我并不是要冒犯你母亲

975
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,360
但说到底 他们所做的一切 都是为了他们自己

976
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,990
你什么意思

977
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,430
当心点

978
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,270
对任何人都不能说这件事

979
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,410
记住你训练的那些

980
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,110
皇帝有什么口谕

981
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,030
他要加强你的力量

982
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,990
让他的萨督卡皇家部队助你一臂之力

983
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,940
我知道你是谁

984
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,330
"此乃正道 与生俱来
你应知道 出神入化"

985
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,000
萨卢萨 塞孔杜斯

986
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,020
帝国军队星球

987
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,200
为何男爵派我们

988
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,080
哈科宁的人比厄崔迪人多

989
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,920
男爵并不需要我们

990
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:19,470
我们是萨督卡帝国军团

991
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:20,890
帝国之刃

992
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,430
任何对抗我们的人都将倒下

993
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,530
只要是皇帝的旨意

994
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,240
定当完成

995
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:22,300
(保罗母亲是其父亲的爱妾)

996
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:15,810
我们把他们丢进沙漠里

997
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,440
任由沙虫吞食

998
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,650
为什么不直接割断他们的喉咙呢

999
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:26,400
因为我们答应了女先知

1000
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,910
这样就不是我们杀死他们的了

1001
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,120
有伤疤的那个是聋子

1002
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,040
别乱来 你还没准备好

1003
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:47,190
注意密语的音调

1004
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:54,530
差不多了

1005
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:57,280
我们把那个男孩扔下去吧

1006
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:40,530
我们并不孤单

1007
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:34,960
他是救世主吗

1008
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,250
他还没有证明自己

1009
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:34,990
太阳快升起了

1010
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:37,540
我们必须到达山脊洞穴

1011
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:42,040
外人之命 去了那再做决断

1012
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:49,050
在那之前

1013
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:52,340
我保他们性命

1014
02:15:53,950 --> 02:15:55,720
我向你们保证

1015
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:44,230
我们得赶紧走了

1016
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:46,150
我们得赶紧走了
