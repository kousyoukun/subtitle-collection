1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,840
梦是来自内心深处的信息

2
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,940
每当日落 我的星球厄拉科斯都异常美丽
My planet Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low.

3
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,480
伴随着滚滚黄沙
Rolling over the sands...

4
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,490
你能在空气中感受到香料的存在
you can see spice in the air.

5
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,250
夜幕降临 香料开采机在此着陆
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
为了躲避白天的高温
The outsiders race against time

7
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,760
异星人争分夺秒地工作
to avoid the heat of the day.

8
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,650
他们就在我们面前蹂躏我们的土地
They ravage our lands in front of our eyes.

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,190
他们对我们所做的一切是如此残忍
Their cruelty to my people is all I've known.

10
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,240
这些异星人 哈克南人
These outsiders, the Harkonnens,

11
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,490
在我出生前就已经来到了这儿
came long before I was born.

12
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,500
他们控制了香料的生产
By controlling spice production,

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,460
从而变得极为富有
they became obscenely rich.

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,830
甚至超过了皇帝本人
Richer than the Emperor himself.

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,960
我们的战士无法从哈克南人手中
Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis from

16
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,040
解放厄拉科斯
the Harkonnens,

17
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,340
但有一天 接到皇帝的谕旨
but one day, by Imperial decree,

18
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,260
他们离开了
they were gone.

19
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,640
皇帝为什么会这么做
Why did the Emperor choose this path?

20
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,190
下一个压迫我们的人又会是谁
And who will our next oppressors be?

21
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,990
沙丘

22
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,850
（10191年）

23
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:53,150
（卡拉丹 厄崔迪家族母星）

24
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,950
幸好你起得早
It's good you're up early.

25
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,620
你父亲想让你在传令官抵达前穿好正装
Your father wants you in full dress before the Emperor's Herald arrives.

26
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,620
正装 
Full dress?

27
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,750
军服吗 
Military?

28
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,630
穿礼服
Ceremonial.

29
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,300
既然都定好了 为何还要走这种形式
Why do we have to go through all this when it's already been decided?

30
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,260
仪式感
Ceremony.

31
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,090
好吧

32
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,350
谢谢
Thank you.

33
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,970
想喝水的话 可以命令我给你
If you want it, make me give it to you.

34
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,430
用音控力
Use the Voice.

35
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,310
妈妈 我刚睡醒
Mom, I just woke up.

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,700
把水递给我
Give me the water.

37
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,530
杯子听不懂你说话 命令我
The glass can't hear you. Command me.

38
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,890
把水给我
Give me the water.

39
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,450
差口气
Almost.

40
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,160
差口气吗 
Almost?

41
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,370
贝尼杰瑟里特姐妹会的本事 没那么好学 保罗
Bene Gesserit skills take years to learn, Paul.

42
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,370
你好像很累
You look tired.

43
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,670
又做梦了 
More dreams?

44
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,420
没有
No.

45
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,680
极端的高温和恶劣的气候条件
Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events

46
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,600
让厄拉科斯城外的生存条件变得无比艰难
make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile,

47
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,270
飓沙暴的威力甚至足以切断金属
with sandstorms powerful enough to cut through metal.

48
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,230
只有那里土生土长的弗雷曼人
Only the native tribes known as the Fremen

49
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,070
才能在这样的环境中生存下来
have adapted well enough to survive.

50
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,200
弗雷曼人喜欢居住在
Preferring to inhabit

51
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,070
厄拉科斯最偏远的地区
the remotest regions of Arrakis,

52
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,290
他们和巨型沙虫共同生存在沙漠的深处
the Fremen share the deep desert with the giant sandworms

53
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,870
他们视沙虫为沙漠之主
known to the Fremen as  Shai-Hulud.

54
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,630
由于长期接触香料
Long exposure to spice has given

55
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,000
使得弗雷曼人拥有了独特的蓝色眼睛
the tribe their characteristic blue eyes,

56
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,960
人们称之为湛蓝之眼
the Eyes of Ibad.

57
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,720
外人对弗雷曼人所知甚少
Little else is known of the Fremen,

58
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,180
只知道他们极度危险且不可信赖
except that they are dangerous

59
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,680
弗雷曼人的袭击
and unreliable.

60
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,980
让香料开采行动变得异常凶险
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting extremely hazardous.

61
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,940
对弗雷曼人而言 香料是神圣的物质
For the Fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen

62
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,900
它能维持生命且对身体非常有益
which preserves life and brings enormous health benefits.

63
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,150
在帝国中
For the Imperium,

64
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,700
宇航公会的领航员会借助香料
spice is used by the navigators of the Spacing Guild

65
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,620
找到星球间安全通行的航线
to find safe paths between the stars.

66
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,790
没有香料 星际航行将变得寸步难行
Without spice, interstellar travel is impossible,

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,710
这也使得香料成为了宇宙中最宝贵的物质
making it by far the most valuable substance in the universe.

68
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,760
微笑 哥尼
Smile, Gurney.

69
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,760
我在笑
I am smiling.

70
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,970
这次他们要花多少钱
How much will it cost them,

71
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,520
远道而来走这个过场
traveling all this way for this formality?

72
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,650
三名公会领航员
Three Guild Navigators.

73
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,860
来回一共一百四十六万零六十二帝国币
A total of 1.46 million, 62 solaris, round trip.

74
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,710
承蒙柯瑞诺家族沙达姆四世皇恩
By the grace of Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,630
一切已知宇宙的统治者
ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne

76
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,590
帕迪沙皇帝的金狮王座在上
of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe,

77
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,220
本人是皇帝钦点的星变传令官
I stand before you as Herald of the Change.

78
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,010
仪式见证人包括帝国法庭的成员
We are witnessed by members of the Imperial Court,

79
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,600
宇航公会的代表
representatives of the Spacing Guild

80
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,850
以及贝尼杰瑟里特姐妹会的姐妹
and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

81
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,900
皇帝颁布谕旨
The Emperor has spoken.

82
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,740
厄崔迪家族即刻获得
"House Atreides shall immediately

83
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,950
厄拉科斯星球的管辖权
take control of Arrakis

84
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,910
全权管理那里的一切
and serve as its steward."

85
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,450
是否接受 
Do you accept?

86
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,630
我们是厄崔迪家族
We are House Atreides.

87
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,970
我们服从皇帝的命令
There is no call we do not answer,

88
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,140
无条件地忠于皇帝
there is no faith that we betray.

89
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,520
皇帝希望我们为厄拉科斯带去和平
The Emperor asks us to bring peace to Arrakis.

90
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,850
厄崔迪家族领命
House Atreides accepts.

91
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,150
厄崔迪 厄崔迪 厄崔迪
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

92
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,360
厄崔迪 厄崔迪 厄崔迪
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

93
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,910
您的印章
Your seal.

94
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,660
这样就结束了 
So, it's done?

95
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
结束了
It's done.

96
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,270
情况怎么样 
How was it?

97
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,310
稳定器太松了
Stabilizers are too loose.

98
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
我们会修好的
-We'll dial it in.

99
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,320
谢了 伙计
-Thank you, my friend.

100
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,320
没事
Got it.

101
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
邓肯
Duncan.

102
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,610
好小子
My boy.

103
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
嘿
Hey. Hey.

104
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,280
你好 孩子
Paul, my boy.

105
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,620
你明天要去厄拉科斯了是吗 
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow.

106
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,080
和先遣队一起
With the advance team.

107
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,080
对 明天去厄拉科斯 和先遣队一起
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team.

108
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,840
我想你带上我
I'd like you to take me with you.

109
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,960
是吗 
You would?

110
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,720
那太糟了 因为不行
Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no.

111
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,880
邓肯
Duncan.

112
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,390
你想害我上军事法庭吗 
Are you trying to get me court-martialed?

113
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,470
到底怎么了 
What's going on?

114
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,060
有些话我能对你说吗 
Can I trust you with something?

115
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,060
当然 你知道的
Always. You know that.

116
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,860
我最近常做梦
I've been having dreams.

117
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,320
梦到厄拉科斯和弗雷曼人
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

118
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,080
是吗 所以呢 
Okay. So?

119
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,960
还梦到了你
I saw you.

120
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,510
和弗雷曼人一起
With the Fremen.

121
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,890
这是个好兆头 意味着我能找到他们 对吧 
So, I do find them. There you go. That's a good omen right there, right?

122
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,020
兰威尔
Lanville!

123
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,070
我梦到你死了 在战斗中死去
I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle.

124
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,870
感觉要是我在场的话 你就不会死
It felt like if I had been there, you'd be alive.

125
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,120
首先 我不会死
First off, I'm not gonna die.

126
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,080
我没跟你开玩笑
You're not taking me seriously.

127
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,460
所以你才想跟我一起去 听着
That's why you want to come with me. Listen.

128
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,720
梦能创造故事 可醒来后发生的才最重要
Dreams make good stories, but everything important happens when we're awake.

129
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,680
因为那才是你要去创造的现实
'Cause that's when we make things happen.

130
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,220
看看你 长肌肉了
Look at you. Put on some muscle?

131
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,430
真的吗 
I did?

132
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
假的
No.

133
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,980
嘿
Hey.

134
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,980
我们厄拉科斯见 小子
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

135
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,640
父亲 明天我想和邓肯艾达荷一起
Father, I'd like to ask to join Duncan Idaho

136
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,940
去厄拉科斯进行侦查行动
on his scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow.

137
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,440
我学过弗雷曼语 能帮上忙
I've studied the Fremen language, I'd be an asset.

138
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
绝不可能
Out of the question.

139
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,320
你和我们其他人一样 过几周再过去
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis, like the rest of us.

140
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,860
我一直都在接受训练
I've been training my whole life.

141
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,400
如果不让我面对真正的危险
What is the point if I'm not allowed

142
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,110
那有什么意义 你明知故问 保罗
to face some actual risk? You know why, Paul.

143
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,780
你是厄崔迪家族的未来
You're the future of House Atreides.

144
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,330
爷爷当年把斗牛当作游戏
And Grandfather fought bulls for sport!

145
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,490
没错
Yes.

146
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,710
可结果呢 
And look where that got him.

147
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,880
我需要你在我身边
I need you by my side.

148
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,510
我们到了那儿后会面临巨大的危险
When we get to Arrakis, we'll face enormous danger.

149
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,800
什么危险 
What danger?

150
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,340
弗雷曼人 还是沙漠 
The Fremen? The desert?

151
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,930
政治上的危险
Political danger.

152
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,100
各大家族都希望我们出来领头
The Great Houses look to us for leadership,

153
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,390
这威胁到了皇帝
and this threatens the Emperor.

154
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,810
从哈克南家族手里夺走厄拉科斯
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens

155
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,860
然后交给我们 其实是想挑起战争
and making it ours, he sets the stage for a war

156
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,240
借此削弱双方家族
which would weaken both houses.

157
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,570
如果我们能借此机会
But if we hold firm,

158
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,950
探索出厄拉科斯真正的财富
and tap the true power of Arrakis,

159
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,950
我们就会变得无比强大
we could be stronger than ever.

160
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,450
那是什么意思 
What does that mean?

161
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,660
靠开采香料 继续压迫弗雷曼人 
Mining spice, keeping the Fremen in their place?

162
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,000
这没比哈克南人好到哪去
We'd be no better than Harkonnens.

163
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
不
No.

164
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,460
是靠结盟 和弗雷曼人
By making an alliance with the Fremen.

165
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,380
所以我才派邓肯先过去安排
That's what I've sent Duncan Idaho to arrange.

166
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,680
在卡拉丹我们靠的是空气和海洋的力量
Here on Caladan, we've ruled by air power and sea power.

167
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,470
在厄拉科斯 我们要学会利用沙漠的力量
On Arrakis, we need to cultivate desert power.

168
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,940
我要你列席委员会 了解我的计划
I want you sitting in on my Council. Learn what I do.

169
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,820
如果我不是呢 爸爸 
What if I'm not, Dad?

170
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,490
不是什么 
Not what?

171
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,530
厄崔迪家族的未来
The future of House Atreides.

172
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,460
我也曾和我父亲说过我不要这个
I told my father I didn't want this either.

173
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,140
我想当个飞行员
I wanted to be a pilot.

174
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,430
你从没和我提过
You never told me that.

175
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,180
你爷爷曾说过
Your grandfather said,

176
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,900
真正的领袖不是天生的
"A great man doesn't seek to lead.

177
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,730
而是当使命召唤时 他会挺身而出
He's called to it, and he answers."

178
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,570
就算你选择拒绝
And if your answer is no...

179
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,410
你依然是我心目中的那个你
you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be...

180
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,080
我的儿子
my son.

181
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,130
我找到了自己的路
I found my own way to it.

182
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,890
希望你也一样
Maybe you'll find yours.

183
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,850
为了我们的先人
In their memory...

184
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,190
去试试吧
give it a try.

185
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,700
不要背对着门站
Don't stand with your back to the door.

186
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,620
要我和你说多少次 
How many times do we have to tell you?

187
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,750
我能听出你的脚步声 哥尼哈莱克
I could tell it was you by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

188
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,250
别人可以模仿我的脚步声
Someone might imitate my stride.

189
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,960
我能分得清
I know the difference.

190
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,670
你成新的兵器老师了 
Are you the new Weapons Master?

191
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,250
邓肯艾达荷不在
With Duncan Idaho gone,

192
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,210
我必须尽我所能
I must make do as best I can.

193
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,760
选兵器吧
Choose your blade.

194
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,470
我今天很累 哥尼
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

195
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,590
不如唱首歌来听听
Give us a song instead.

196
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,810
没礼貌
That's rude.

197
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
来啊
Come on.

198
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,700
来啊
Come on.

199
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,080
老家伙
Old man.

200
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,640
只要刀够慢就能穿过防护盾
Ah, the slow blade penetrates the shield.

201
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,020
我今天没心情
I guess I'm not in the mood today.

202
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,520
-心情  -对
-Mood? -Yeah.

203
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,810
这关心情什么事 
What's mood to do with it?

204
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,690
战斗是出于需要 谁在乎你的心情 
You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood.

205
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,690
给我继续
Now fight!

206
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
再来
Come on!

207
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,130
我赢了
I have you.

208
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,470
对
Aye.

209
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,800
但看看下面 少主
But look down, my lord.

210
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,760
我们会同归于尽
You'd have joined me in death.

211
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,600
看来现在有心情了
I see you found the mood.

212
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,150
真有那么糟吗 
Will it be that bad?

213
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,820
你真不明白 是吧 
You don't get it, do you?

214
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,080
你根本不明白迎接我们的将会是什么
You don't really understand the grave nature of what's happening to us.

215
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,120
80年来 哈克南家族统治着厄拉科斯
For 80 years, Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen.

216
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,710
他们占领香料区整整80年
80 years of owning the spice fields.

217
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,920
那是多大一笔财富
Can you imagine the wealth?

218
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,460
我要在你的眼睛里看到你准备好了
Your eyes. I need to see it in your eyes.

219
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,670
你没见识过哈克南人 但我有
You never met Harkonnens before, I have.

220
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,050
他们不是人类 而是禽兽
They're not human, they're brutal!

221
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,550
你必须准备好
You have to be ready.

222
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,910
（桀迪主星 哈克南家族母星）

223
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,720
男爵大人
Lord Baron.

224
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,180
拉班
Rabban.

225
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,730
最后一批飞船已经离开厄拉科斯了
The last of our ships have left Arrakis.

226
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,020
任务完成
It's done.

227
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,650
非常好
Very good.

228
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,530
叔叔 我们怎么可以接受 
Uncle, how can we let this happen?

229
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,570
皇帝他怎么可以
How can the Emperor

230
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,830
夺走我们所建立的一切
take everything we've built

231
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,950
还把它给了那个公爵 
and give it to that Duke?

232
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,500
凭什么 
How?

233
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,830
别以为这是在厚待他
Don't be too sure it's an act of love.

234
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,000
他什么意思 
What does he mean?

235
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,550
俗话说 福祸相生
When is a gift not a gift?

236
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,390
厄崔迪家族的呼声越来越高
The Atreides' voice is rising,

237
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,980
而皇帝为人善妒
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

238
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,240
一个既危险又善妒的人
A dangerous, jealous man.

239
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,970
保罗
Paul.

240
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,100
保罗 醒醒
Paul, wake up.

241
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,400
怎么了 
What's wrong?

242
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,320
穿好衣服 跟我来
Get dressed and come with me.

243
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,180
什么事 
What is this?

244
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,840
圣母盖乌斯海伦莫希阿姆来了
The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

245
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,810
她是我在贝尼杰瑟里特姐妹会的老师
She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school.

246
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,810
现在她是皇帝的真言师
She's now Truthsayer to the Emperor himself.

247
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,230
她想要见见你
She would like to meet you.

248
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,900
为什么 
Why?

249
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,070
她想要了解一下你的梦境
She wants to know about your dreams.

250
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,530
她怎么知道我的梦境 
How does she know about my dreams?

251
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,410
为什么岳医生也在这儿 
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

252
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,120
他只会耽误你一会儿
He only needs a moment.

253
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,370
你好 少主
Hello, young master.

254
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,460
你母亲让我替你检查一下
Your mother asked me to check your vitals.

255
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,840
出什么事了 
What's happening?

256
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,590
有关姐妹会的事我是略有所闻

257
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,680
她们说她们的存在是为了造福更多的人

258
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,310
我并不是要冒犯你的母亲

259
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,270
但说到底 她们做的一切

260
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,980
都是为了她们自己人

261
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,060
你什么意思

262
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,020
当心点

263
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,070
少主一切无恙 夫人
His heart is strong as ever, my lady.

264
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,490
别和人提起这事

265
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,500
保罗
Paul...

266
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,220
记住你受过的训练

267
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,370
你是谁 
Who are you?

268
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,040
桀骜不驯的眼神 和他父亲一样
Defiance in the eyes. Like his father.

269
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,710
出去吧
Leave us.

270
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,380
圣母怎么说 你就怎么做
You must do everything the Reverend Mother tells you.

271
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,890
你在我母亲家赶她出去
You dismiss my mother in her own house.

272
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,470
走到跟前 跪下
Come here. Kneel.

273
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,770
你居然敢对我用音控力 
How dare you use the Voice on me?

274
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,700
把右手放进盒子里
Put your right hand in the box.

275
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,530
你母亲让你照我说的做
Your mother bade you obey me.

276
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,170
指着你脖子的是戈姆刺
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar.

277
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,470
一种毒针 能让人当场毙命
A poison needle. Instant death.

278
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,180
测试很简单 如果把手从盒子里抽走
The test is simple. Remove your hand from the box

279
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,850
你就会死
and you die.

280
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,930
盒子里有什么 
What's in the box?

281
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,440
痛苦
Pain.

282
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,360
不必惊动侍卫
No need to call the guards.

283
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,530
你母亲在门后守着 没人能进得来
Your mother stands behind that door. No one would get past her.

284
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,200
为什么要这么做 
Why are you doing this?

285
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,290
掉进陷阱的野兽
An animal caught in a trap

286
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,210
会咬断自己的腿 以求保命
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

287
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,880
你会怎么做 
What will you do?

288
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,700
安静
Silence.

289
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,340
绝不能惊慌
I must not fear.

290
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,050
绝不能惊慌
I must not fear.

291
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,430
恐惧是思维的杀手
Fear is the mind-killer.

292
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,400
恐惧 是最终导致灭亡的死神
Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.

293
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,570
我会直面恐惧 任由其穿过我的身体
And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it to pass over me and through me.

294
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,170
但当它过去之后
And when it has gone past...

295
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,680
我会洞悉它的轨迹
I will turn the inner eye and see its path.

296
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,480
恐惧所到之处 万物无存
And where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.

297
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,950
唯我独立
Only I will remain.

298
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,120
够了
Enough.

299
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,640
就像用筛网滤沙子一样 我们也会筛选人
Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people.

300
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,850
如果你不能控制你内心的冲动
If you had been unable to control your impulses,

301
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,140
像野兽那样
like an animal,

302
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,350
那我们就不能让你活着
we could not let you live.

303
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,820
你继承了太多的力量
You inherit too much power.

304
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,190
就因为我是公爵的儿子 
What, because I'm a duke's son?

305
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,900
是因为你是杰西卡的儿子
Because you are Jessica's son.

306
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,200
你继承的不光是身份 孩子
You have more than one birthright, boy.

307
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,280
杰西卡 
Jessica?

308
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,000
你有按照姐妹会的要求训练他
You've been training him in the Way.

309
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,010
和我说说你的那些梦
Tell me about these dreams.

310
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,970
我今晚刚做了一个
-I had one tonight.

311
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,180
你看到了什么 
-What did you see?

312
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,430
一个女孩儿 在厄拉科斯
A girl. On Arrakis.

313
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,810
你之前梦到过她吗 
Have you dreamt of her before?

314
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,900
无数次
Many times.

315
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,280
你梦到的东西是否经常在现实中重现 
Do you often dream things that happen just as you dreamed them?

316
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,700
并非如此
Not exactly.

317
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,540
再见 年轻人
Goodbye, young human.

318
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,960
希望你好好活下去
I hope you live.

319
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,220
有必要做得那么过吗 
Did you have to go that far?

320
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,640
你不顾姐妹会的规矩 一心训练他
You chose to train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule.

321
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,600
他拥有我们的能力
He wields our power.

322
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,810
我必须测试出他的极限
He had to be tested to the limits.

323
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,980
如此天赋浪费在了一个男人身上
So much potential, wasted in a male.

324
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,820
告诉过你要生个女儿
You were told to bear only daughters.

325
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,070
可你自负地以为可以培养出一个
But you, in your pride, thought you could produce

326
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,400
魁萨茨哈德拉克
the  Kwisatz Haderach.

327
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,570
我错了吗 
Was I wrong?

328
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,160
他没死在里面 算你走运
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

329
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,120
他若真是天选之人 他的路还远着呢
If he is The One, he has a long way to go.

330
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,620
他的洞见力还没有觉醒 却又要身赴火海
His Sight is barely awakened, and now he goes into the fire.

331
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,790
而我们历时百年的计划不容有失
But our plans are measured in centuries.

332
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,550
如果他失败的话 我们还有别的选择
We have other prospects if he fails his promise.

333
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,630
您就这么没信心吗 
Do you see so little hope?

334
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,010
关于厄拉科斯 能帮你的我们都做了
On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you.

335
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,140
路已经铺好了
A path has been laid.

336
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,640
祈祷他不会错失良机吧
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

337
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,070
保罗
Paul.

338
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,320
那是什么意思 
What does it mean?

339
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,490
说我可能是天选之人 
That I could be The One?

340
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,990
你听到了
You heard.

341
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,830
贝尼·杰瑟里特姐妹会
The Bene Gesserit serve

342
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,120
是几大家族强有力的后盾
as powerful partners to the Great Houses,

343
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,790
但远不止如此
but there's more to it.

344
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,710
你们试图暗中操控帝国的政治走向
You steer the politics of the Imperium from the shadows.

345
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,460
我知道
I know.

346
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,420
可你不知道全部
You don't know everything.

347
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,430
几千年来
For thousands of years,

348
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,970
我们谨慎地选择不同的血统
we've been carefully crossings bloodlines

349
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,140
-就是为了培育出… -天选之人
-to bring forth... -The One?

350
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,640
一个先知
A mind...

351
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,060
他将强大到足以连接时间和空间
powerful enough to bridge space and time.

352
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,570
连接过去和未来
Past and future.

353
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,570
引领我们走向更好的未来
Who can help us into a better future.

354
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,780
我们相信他就快出现了
We think he's very close now.

355
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,830
有人认为他就在这儿
Some believe he's here.

356
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
全都是设计好的
All part of a plan.

357
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,180
开启防护盾
Shield.

358
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,440
呼吸着时间的气息 往事如飞沙般坠落
"My lungs taste the air of Time, Blown past falling sand..."

359
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,480
杜菲哈瓦特
Thufir Hawat.

360
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,160
我的少主
Young master!

361
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,490
踏上新的世界 感觉如何 
How does it feel to walk on a new world?

362
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,540
难以克制的激动
Exciting, to say the least.

363
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,540
公爵大人
My lord.

364
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,830
怎么样 老朋友 
How are you, old friend?

365
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,580
先遣队已对城市做好了防护
My advance team has secured the city.

366
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,000
还有几个地区正在逐一布防
We're still smoothing out a few rough spots.

367
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,340
夫人
My lady.

368
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,720
李桑阿尔盖布
Lisan al-Gaib!

369
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:35,490
李桑阿尔盖布 李桑阿尔盖布
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

370
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:41,330
李桑阿尔盖布 李桑阿尔盖布
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

371
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:47,710
李桑阿尔盖布 李桑阿尔盖布
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

372
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,720
别被他们的热情骗了
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

373
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,930
他们只是遵照之前的规矩 强制性动作
They follow their old masters' rules. Mandatory attendance.

374
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,010
哈克南人喜欢这一套
That's Harkonnen love out there.

375
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:14,280
厄崔迪 厄崔迪 厄崔迪
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

376
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,780
厄崔迪 厄崔迪 厄崔迪
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

377
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
现在送你们去能避开太阳的地方
Let's get you out of the sun.

378
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,500
这里的太阳能活活晒死人
The heat can kill in this place.

379
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,520
他们刚才指着我们
They were pointing at us.

380
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,930
他们在叫什么 
What are they shouting?

381
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,730
李桑阿尔盖布
Lisan al-Gaib.

382
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,940
意思是天外之音
"Voice from the Outer World."

383
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,820
预言中的救世主
It's their name for "messiah."

384
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,650
这说明姐妹会一直有在这里做事
It means the Bene Gesserit have been at work here.

385
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,070
灌输迷信思想
Planting superstitions.

386
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,950
是为我们铺路 保罗
Preparing the way, Paul.

387
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,700
几百年来 这些人一直在等他们的救世主
These people have waited for centuries for the  Lisan al-Gaib.

388
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,170
他们在你身上看到了救世主的影子
They see you, they see the signs.

389
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,380
他们看到的都是被安排好的
They see what they've been told to see.

390
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,970
准备起飞
We're good to go.

391
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,390
屏蔽场城墙
Shield Wall.

392
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,770
保护城市远离高温和沙虫的侵袭
Protects the city from the weather and the worms.

393
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,690
当地人都称其为“上帝之手”
The locals call the big one the Hand of God.

394
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,660
好吧 “上帝之手”对我们的通讯系统
Well, the Hand of God is wreaking havoc

395
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,660
造成了严重的破坏
on our comms system.

396
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,120
太安静了
It's so quiet.

397
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,370
是的
Yeah.

398
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,330
这也正是我担心的
That's what worries me, too.

399
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,590
那儿是飞船港
There's the spaceport

400
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,680
扬尘的地方是香料提炼厂
and that plume of dust there is the spice refinery.

401
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,560
两个最容易受袭的地方
Our two most vulnerable points.

402
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,350
我要你守好它们
I want you guarding them.

403
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,890
如果没法把香料送去别的星球
If we can't refine spice and ship it off-world,

404
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,980
那就只能等死
- we're dead here.

405
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,890
大人
- My lord.

406
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,270
太阳太晒了 我们得关闭大门
The sun's getting too high. We need to seal the doors.

407
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,860
怎么形容这破地方来着 
What do they say about this hellhole again?

408
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,320
想洗澡 就拿沙子擦你的屁股
"To shower, you scrub your ass with sand," my lord.

409
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,740
他们是这么说的
That's what they say.

410
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,240
确实是这样
That's what they say.

411
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,500
这些是管家的人选 夫人
Candidates for a housekeeper, my lady.

412
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,770
你叫什么 
What is your name?

413
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,100
我叫夏道特梅帕丝 夫人
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

414
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,900
其他人下去吧 谢谢
The rest of you may go. Thank you.

415
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,700
夏道特
Shadout.

416
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,410
这是弗雷曼的古语
It's an old Chakobsa word.

417
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,660
汲水斗的意思
"Well-dipper."

418
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,790
你是弗雷曼人 你知道这儿的古语 
You know the ancient tongues?

419
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,120
我还知道很多
I know many things.

420
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,920
比如你在衣服里藏着一把武器
I know that you have a weapon concealed

421
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
还不是时候
in your bodice.

422
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,920
如果你想要害我
If you mean to harm me,

423
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,010
我必须提醒你 无论你手里藏了什么
I must warn you, whatever you're hiding,

424
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,340
都不会管用的
it won't be enough.

425
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,510
这把武器将会是个礼物
The weapon is meant as a gift

426
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,640
如果你真是天选之人的话
if you are truly The One.

427
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,030
你知道这个吗 
Do you know this?

428
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
这是把晶牙匕
It's a crysknife.

429
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,920
知道它的寓意吗 
Do you know its meaning?

430
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,380
准备动手

431
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,170
它是沙漠之主的…
It's a maker...

432
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,850
沙漠深处的造物主
A maker of the deep desert.

433
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,230
当你相信一个预言太久
When you have lived with prophecy for so long,

434
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,480
预言实现的那一刻反而会让你震惊
the moment of revelation is a shock.

435
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,900
李桑阿尔盖布 那对母子
Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son.

436
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,160
它是你的了
It is yours.

437
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,460
它是沙漠之主的牙齿
Tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

438
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:37,700
李桑阿尔盖布 李桑阿尔盖布
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

439
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
你好
Hello.

440
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,720
这个点你不应该到外面来
You shouldn't be out here at this hour of the day.

441
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,430
他们不也在外面
They're out here.

442
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,810
他们是来朝拜的
Fremen pilgrims.

443
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,690
他们无所谓会不会中暑
They don't care about heatstroke.

444
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,610
真没想到这里还能有枣椰树
I didn't know date palms could even be found out here.

445
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,360
这些不是土生土长的
these aren't indigenous.

446
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,700
没有我它们活不下去
They can't survive without me.

447
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,160
它们中的每一棵
Each one of these

448
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,120
都要喝掉相当于5个人的饮水量
drinks every day the equivalent of five men.

449
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,370
一共20棵树 100个人
Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives.

450
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,960
那是不是该移走它们 省点水 
Should we remove them? Save the water?

451
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,210
不
No, no, no.

452
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,710
这些是圣树
These are sacred.

453
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,640
旧时的梦
Old dream.

454
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,610
在厄拉科斯 体型最大也最危险的生物
The largest and most dangerous organism on Arrakis is

455
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,610
就是沙虫 身长可以达到400米
the sandworm, capable of reaching 400 meters in length.

456
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,780
为了避免发出带有节奏的声响
To avoid making rhythmic noises,

457
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,370
而引来沙虫
which attract the sandworms,

458
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,330
弗雷曼人选择用沙地微步在沙漠里行走
the Fremen cross desert spaces using the sandwalk,

459
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,000
这种步伐宛如跳舞 毫无节奏可言
a dance-like motion with irregular rhythm which emulates

460
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,580
正如沙漠本身的声音
the natural sounds of the desert.

461
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,130
今天的厄拉科斯仍有植物幸存
What scant plant life exists on Arrakis

462
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,010
全要归功于弗雷曼人
is thanks to the Fremen,

463
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,930
他们一直在种植深入土壤的地球植物
who have cultivated deep-rooted terranic plants

464
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:23,600
例如仙人掌 驴灌木 沙地马鞭草 以及香灌木
such as saguaro, burrobush, sand-verbena and incense bush.

465
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,850
据记载 牧羊人树的树根是最长的
The shepherd's tree has the deepest documented roots,

466
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,730
可以伸入超过137米深的地下
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

467
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,240
这些植物都可以在炎热且贫瘠的
These plants cling to life in a parched,

468
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,400
沙漠土地中生存
nutrient-poor landscape.

469
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:48,930
是猎杀镖
It's a hunter-seeker.

470
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,270
操控者一定就在附近
The operator must be nearby.

471
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,320
站一边去

472
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,820
有个哈克南探子
The Harkonnen agent was cemented

473
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,650
六周前被水泥封在了洞里
into that hole six weeks ago.

474
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,990
然后通过水管在墙里操控猎杀镖
Ran the hunter-seeker through a water pipe inside the walls.

475
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,830
我让您失望了 没什么好辩解的
Sire, I failed you today. There's no excuse.

476
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,330
我向您请辞
You have my resignation.

477
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,330
你要我们的损失变得更大吗 
You would deprive us of your talents at this time?

478
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,460
大人 我的荣耀…
Sire, my honor demands...

479
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,580
这些人想要我儿子的命
They tried to take the life of my son!

480
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,050
我才不关心你的荣耀呢
I don't give a damn about your honor.

481
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,590
想将功补过的话 多抓几个间谍回来
You want absolution? Go catch some spies.

482
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,630
遵命
Your Grace.

483
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,720
让这东西出去
The thing must leave.

484
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,270
您但说无妨 我们的宠物听不懂您的话
You can speak without fear. Our pet doesn't understand your language.

485
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,860
出去
Get out.

486
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,530
它听得懂
It understands.

487
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,700
开启隔音锥区
Activate silence.

488
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,460
皇帝怎么说

489
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,630
他会出手相助

490
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,960
借助他的萨多卡军团

491
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,630
这事绝不能走漏风声
It must never be known.

492
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,260
整个厄拉科斯星球没有卫星
There's no satellites over Arrakis.

493
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,010
厄崔迪家族会无声无息地死去
The Atreides will die in the dark.

494
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,600
关于这一点
On that matter,

495
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,310
我们姐妹会并不关心厄崔迪公爵的死活
Duke Leto Atreides means nothing to our order.

496
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,360
但他的妻子是我们的人 还有她的儿子
But his wife is under our protection and by extension, her son.

497
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,610
让他们有尊严地被流放
Allow them the dignity of exile.

498
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,490
我们哈克南家族永远不会违背
House Harkonnen would never dream of violating

499
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,410
姐妹会的圣令
the sanctity of your order.

500
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,750
我向你保证 我们不会伤害他们
I give you my word. We will not harm them.

501
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,850
如果放过公爵的儿子
If the Duke's son lives...

502
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,020
厄崔迪家族都得死
No Atreides will live.

503
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,650
大人 你刚答应过那巫婆
My lord, you gave your word to the witch.

504
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,150
她会知道的
She sees too much.

505
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,200
我说了不会伤害他们 我会做到
I said I would not harm them. And I shall not.

506
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,570
但那里可是厄拉科斯
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

507
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,990
沙漠容不下弱者
And the desert takes the weak.

508
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,870
我的沙漠
My desert.

509
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,250
我的厄拉科斯
My Arrakis.

510
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,670
我的沙丘
My Dune.

511
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,390
第一次参加战略会议
Your first strategy meeting.

512
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,850
保罗·厄崔迪徒手抓住了一枚猎杀镖
Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers in his bare hands

513
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,850
就像古时候的英雄一般
like a hero of old.

514
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,770
谢谢你当众羞辱我 老家伙
Thanks for the humiliation, old man.

515
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,400
我会盯着点的
Gotta keep an eye on you.

516
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,360
起立
Attention!

517
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,490
开始吧
Let's get started.

518
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,950
杜菲 汇报一下情况
Thufir. Operations.

519
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,080
我拿到了哈克南人账本的复印件
I secured a copy of the Harkonnens' account books.

520
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,090
那些哈克南人
The Harkonnens were taking

521
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,670
每年都会从这里获利100亿帝国币
10 billion solaris out of here every year.

522
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:09,300
他们要吸取海里的财富 沙中隐藏的珍宝
"They shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and the treasure hid in the sand."

523
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,970
短时间内我们达不到那么高的收益
We won't see profits like that for a while.

524
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,260
他们留下的设备太落后了
Not with the equipment they left us.

525
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,230
有多落后 
How bad is it?

526
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,480
这些是香料中转塔
These are spice silos.

527
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,200
我们得填满这里的每一个塔箱
We're meant to fill every crate.

528
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,240
每一个吗 
All of them?

529
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,200
每25个标准日一轮
Every 25 standard days.

530
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,200
哈克南人拖慢了我们的进度
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

531
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,960
那谁来仲裁呢 
But who's meant to arbitrate?

532
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,670
难道没有裁决官来监督交接吗 
Isn't there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition?

533
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,330
皇帝指派了谁 
Who did the Emperor appoint?

534
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,050
列特凯恩斯博士 帝国的星球全知
Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist.

535
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,720
到这儿20年了 据说她为人很古怪
Been here 20 years. Eccentric, from what I'm told.

536
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,140
我要亲自查看一下开采场
I want to see these harvesting fields myself.

537
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,260
我不建议您这么做
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

538
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,520
让这位裁决官陪同我们一起 我们早该见面了
Have this Judge of the Change accompany us. A meeting's long overdue.

539
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,560
总得寻求点帝国的庇护吧
And we'll get a bit of Imperial protection.

540
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,480
找个人质 我喜欢
A hostage. I love it.

541
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,860
他来了 大人
He's here, my lord.

542
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,090
放心跟他们走

543
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,840
客气点 他们是朋友
Take care of them. They are friends.

544
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,180
邓肯
Duncan!

545
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,850
好小子
Ah! My boy!

546
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,980
-你好像长高了 -而你却变臭了
I swear you're getting taller. Well, you smell much worse.

547
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,690
有好多事要和你说 走吧

548
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,860
我和弗雷曼人相处了四周
For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen.

549
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,570
躲在沙漠中一个叫地下城的地方
Hidden in the desert, in a community called a  sietch.

550
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,820
他们的领袖斯第尔格和我一同回来见您
Stilgar, the leader of that  sietch, has come with me to meet you, sire.

551
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,450
那个地下城 怎么隐蔽起来的 
This  sietch,  how is it hidden?

552
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,450
它在地下 厄拉科斯到处是洞穴
It's underground. Arrakis is filled with caverns.

553
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,830
那地方有多大 
How big was the place?

554
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,710
大约有一万人 而地下城有上百个
I'd say 10,000 people. And there are hundreds of  sietches.

555
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,170
上百万的弗雷曼人
Millions of Fremen.

556
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,130
你说对了
You were right.

557
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,840
哈克南人估计整个星球上
The Harkonnen estimate was 50,000 on

558
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,720
只有五万个弗雷曼人
the whole planet.

559
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:17,100
他们看着我找了他们好几天
The Fremen watched me search for them for days.

560
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,470
我一直没见到他们
I never saw them.

561
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,020
后来他们派了名战士来杀我
Finally, they sent a warrior out to kill me.

562
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,770
不得不说
And I gotta tell you,

563
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,310
这次我差点小命不保
I have never come so close to dying.

564
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,900
帝国上下无人能比
There's no finer fighter in the Imperium.

565
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,150
他们打起来特别凶
They fight like demons.

566
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,690
沙漠的力量
Desert power.

567
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,120
邓肯 做得好
Duncan.-Well done.

568
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
谢谢大人
-Thank you, my lord.

569
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,870
阁下 那名领袖身上有刀 他不肯上交
Sire. Their leader has a knife he won't surrender, sire.

570
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,710
是晶牙匕 是他们的圣物
It's a crysknife. It's sacred to his people.

571
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,040
让他进来
Let him pass.

572
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:03,980
停下来
Stop there.

573
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,100
嘿
Hey! Hey!

574
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,440
斯第尔格
Stilgar.

575
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,610
欢迎你
Welcome.

576
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,120
先生 凡是尊重我的人
Sir, I respect the personal dignity

577
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,080
我一定也会以礼相待
of any man that respects mine.

578
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,330
慢着
Hold.

579
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,590
谢谢你 斯第尔格
Thank you, Stilgar,

580
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,010
用你宝贵的水分作为见面礼
for the gift of your body's moisture.

581
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,590
我们接受你的这份诚意
We accept it in the spirit in which it was given.

582
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,770
很高兴你能来
I'm glad you've come.

583
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,400
我相信我们两方的人民
I believe your people and mine

584
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,440
有许多地方可以互帮互助
have much to offer one another.

585
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:55,150
不 你们这些异星人为了香料而来
No, no, you are Outworlders. You come here for the spice,

586
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,570
你们一味地索取 从不懂得回报
you take it, giving nothing in return.

587
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,570
说得对
That's true.

588
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,830
我知道你们一直遭受着哈克南人的压迫
I know you've suffered at the hands of the Harkonnen.

589
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,460
说说你想要什么
Name what you want.

590
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,000
只要我能力所及 我都会无条件答应你
If it's in my power to grant, I'll give it and ask for nothing.

591
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,840
我希望你们不要去找我们的地下城
Mm. I ask for this. Do not seek our  sietches.

592
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,720
不要入侵我们的领地
Do not trespass in our lands.

593
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:20,510
早在你们来之前 这片沙漠就是我们的
The desert was ours long before you came.

594
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,060
你们可以来挖香料 但一旦挖到
So, come and dig your spice, but when you have it,

595
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,640
就请回到屏蔽场城墙里面
go back to this side of the Shield Wall

596
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,640
把沙漠留给弗雷曼人
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

597
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,100
你得称呼公爵“大人”或者“阁下”
You will address the Duke as "my lord" or "sire."

598
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,310
哥尼 你先等一下
Gurney, just... Just a moment.

599
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,780
皇帝赐予我厄拉科斯作为封地
The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief

600
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,900
让我统治并保护它
to rule and protect.

601
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,490
我无法保证自己不会踏入沙漠
I cannot promise not to travel into the desert

602
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,410
如果职责需要的话
if duty compels me.

603
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,910
但地下城永远属于你们
But your  sietches will be yours forever.

604
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,370
只要有我在 你们永远不会被追杀
And you will never be hunted while I govern here.

605
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,260
我钦佩你的承诺
That's very honorable.

606
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,470
我得走了 我要说的就是这些
I must go. That's all I have to say to you.

607
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,930
不留下来吗 我们会款待你
Won't you stay? We would honor you.

608
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,640
我的使命不在这里
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

609
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,640
我认得你

610
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,070
我不喜欢他
I don't like him.

611
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,410
看来计划初有成效
Our plan bears fruit.

612
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,990
但还需要时间 
But it will take time?

613
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,990
没错 确实需要点时间
Yes. It will take time.

614
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,750
这个给你
Here, this is for you.

615
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,050
这是定位罗盘
It's a paracompass.

616
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,090
这里的卫星都有磁场 所以
The moons here have a magnetic field, so...

617
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,430
普通的罗盘不会指向北方
a simple compass needle won't point north.

618
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,260
需要精妙的发条来解决问题
Takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out.

619
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,720
弗雷曼人做的吗 
The Fremen make these?

620
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,270
还有蒸馏服 沙实机
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,

621
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,680
各种各样精致的小玩意儿
and all kinds of ingenious things.

622
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,310
沙实机又是什么 
What the hell is a sand compactor?

623
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,150
这就是沙实机
That's a sand compactor.

624
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,610
行啊 伙计 你快混成原住民了
My God, man, you've gone native.

625
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,110
你喜欢他们
You admire them.

626
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,450
确实
I do.

627
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,240
他们凶猛 但忠诚 天生属于沙漠
They're fierce but loyal. They're attuned to the desert.

628
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,210
他们能融入沙漠 同时也包容着它
Part of it. It's part of them.

629
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:13,460
见到就知道了
You wait till you see it.

630
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,670
那里风景也很美
It's beautiful out there.

631
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,170
全体注意 日出警告
Sunrise warning, all workers.

632
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,130
今天的温度将达到60摄氏度
Temperature today will reach 140 degrees.

633
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,890
现在温度是32摄氏度
We are currently 90 degrees,

634
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,430
10分钟后上升至49摄氏度
and in 10 minutes, we will hit 120 degrees.

635
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,350
最后通知 全体注意 日出警告
Last warning call.

636
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,600
场地将于十分钟后关闭

637
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,490
对接一处 对接二处

638
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,910
今天早晨各个工作区域温度正常

639
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,120
预计保持在75摄氏度左右

640
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,330
北方和东北方向刮来的风将带来大量沙尘

641
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:06,930
这位是裁决官 阁下
The Judge of the Change, sire.

642
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,850
列特凯恩斯博士
Dr. Liet Kynes.

643
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,890
公爵大人 欢迎来到厄拉科斯
My lord Duke. Welcome to Arrakis.

644
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,890
你就是那个星球全知
You're the Imperial Ecologist.

645
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,150
谢谢你的蒸馏服
Thank you for the stillsuits.

646
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,270
那是弗雷曼人制作的
They are of Fremen make.

647
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,610
最好的
The best.

648
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,650
请允许我检查您的蒸馏服是否完好
With your permission, sire, I must check the integrity of your suit...

649
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,450
没关系
It's all right.

650
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,280
没关系
It's all right.

651
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,950
凯恩斯博士 一切交给你了
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

652
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:43,170
蒸馏服是一种非常高效的过滤净化系统
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system.

653
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,720
即便是大清早
Even this early in the morning,

654
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,640
没有它 你们两个小时都撑不过
you wouldn't survive two hours without one of these.

655
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,800
它能冷却身体
It cools the body

656
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,520
吸收汗水然后循环利用
and recycles the water lost to sweat.

657
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,400
只要你们在动 衣服就会运作
Your body's movements provide the power.

658
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,900
面罩里面有根管子 你们可以用它喝过滤后的水
Inside the mask, you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.

659
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,820
运作良好的话
In good working order,

660
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,650
它能保证你们每天只损失少量水分
your suit won't lose more than a thimbleful of water a day.

661
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,240
真是好东西
Most impressive.

662
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,580
看看你的 孩子
Let's have a look at you, lad.

663
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,540
你以前穿过蒸馏服 
You've...worn a stillsuit before?

664
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,120
不 我第一次穿
No, this is my first time.

665
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,050
你的沙地靴脚踝那儿的松紧带箍得正好
Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles.

666
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,590
谁教你的 
Who taught you to do that?

667
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,470
感觉就该那样穿
It seemed the right way.

668
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:34,060
他了解你们的习惯 仿佛与生俱来

669
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:36,850
你是弗雷曼人 
Are you Fremen?

670
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,940
这里地下城和村庄里的人都愿意接纳我
I am accepted in both  sietch  and village.

671
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,650
好了 和我去看看香料沙吧
Now, come and see the spice sands

672
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,110
你们往后的生计都得靠它
on which your livelihood depends.

673
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,780
万一扑翼机掉下去了怎么办 
What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here?

674
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:33,160
掉在这里可就惨了 这里是沙虫的地盘
You wouldn't want to go down out there. It's worm territory.

675
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,830
是沙尘云
Dust cloud.

676
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,120
看见了
I see it.

677
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,710
那是你们的香料开采车
That's one of your harvesters.

678
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,240
你们能看到地面上散布着香料
You can see the spice scattered over the surface.

679
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:15,950
这里香料浓度很高 从颜色判断
A rich spice bed by the color.

680
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,040
飞得再高一点会看得更清楚
If you get a little higher, you'll have a better view.

681
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,550
那几架侦察机是在找虫迹
You see these spotter aircraft looking for wormsign.

682
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,220
虫迹 
Wormsign?

683
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:42,020
一条涌向开采车的沙浪
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

684
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:46,150
沙虫游走在深处 但发动袭击时会靠近地表
Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack.

685
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,360
如果你们愿意等的话 应该能看到一条
If you are patient, we should see one.

686
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,690
沙虫经常出没吗 
A worm always comes?

687
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,490
经常 有节奏的声音会吸引它们
Always. They're drawn by rhythmic noises.

688
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,740
给开采车加上防护盾不就行了 
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

689
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,240
防护盾在沙漠就是死亡信号
A shield's a death sentence in the desert.

690
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:04,160
它们会引来沙虫 诱使沙虫大开杀戒
It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.

691
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,380
那是沙虫吗 
Is that a worm?

692
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,180
还是条大的
Big one.

693
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,560
你眼力不错
You have good eyes.

694
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,940
呼叫开采车德尔塔-埃阿斯九号
Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner.

695
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,980
发现虫迹 请注意
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

696
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:33,150
谁在呼叫德尔塔-埃阿斯九号 完毕
Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over.

697
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,860
他们好像还挺淡定
They seem pretty calm about it.

698

而且我们车上装满了香料 不能弃之不理
Besides, we've got a full load of spice. -We can't just leave it.

751
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,800

保佑他的降临与逝去

775

愿他的到来能净化这个世界
May His passage cleanse the world

776
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,210
为他的子民守护这个世界
and keep the world for His people.

777
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,810
嘿
Hey!

778
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,520
-你不可以像刚才那么冒险 -是 长官

Dr. Kynes.

782
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:35,950
你看到了
You saw it.

783
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:39,040
你亲眼所见 很明显
With your own eyes. It's plain to see.

784
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,250
他们留下的都是些破铜烂铁
Everything they've left us is in shambles.

785
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,080
我们被他们摆了一道
We've been set up to fail.

786
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,420
运载器只是老化了
That carryall was just old.

787
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,800
沙漠对机器一向不太友好
The desert isn't kind to equipment.

788
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,510
如果香料的产量恢复不了
You know what will happen

789
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,050
你知道会有什么后果
if I don't get spice production back on track.

790
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,560
我的职责并不是替你们说话
I'm not here to take your part.

791
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:04,140
铁打的厄拉科斯 流水的统治者
Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.

792
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,650
照顾好你的家人
Take good care of your family.

793
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:16,700
沙漠对人类也不会太友好
The desert's not kind to humans either.

794
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:36,140
香料是一种作用于精神的化学物质
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.

795
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,640
你好像对它比较敏感
You seem to be sensitive.

796
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,270
没什么大碍
You'll be fine.

797
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,400
谢谢你 岳医生
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

798
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,160
根本不是因为过敏
That wasn't an allergic reaction.

799
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,910
我看到了幻象
I had a vision.

800
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,540
我睁大眼睛看
My eyes were wide open.

801
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,840
你看到了什么 
What did you see?

802
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:52,710
魁萨茨哈德拉克
Kwisatz Haderach.

803
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,050
你能看得到
You can see.

804
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,880
梦境很混乱
It's confusing.

805
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,140
我好像看到我死了 但又不是
I thought I saw my death, only it wasn't.

806
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:46,810
有一把匕首 它很重要 不知为何
I know a knife is important, somehow.

807
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,770
有人会给我一把匕首
Someone will hand me a blade,

808
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,730
可又不知会是何人 何时 何地
but I don't know who, or when, or where.

809
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:01,280
可又有一些事 我心里很清楚 我能感受到
Some things, though, are crystal clear. I can feel it.

810
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,870
我知道你怀孕了
I know you're pregnant.

811
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,130
你怎么会知道 
You can't know that.

812
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:20,050
我自己也才刚知道 只有几周而已
I barely know that. It's only been a few weeks.

813
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:30,560
（萨多卡监狱星球 帝国军队大本营）

815
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:40,990
（萨多卡语）

816
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,260
男爵为什么需要我们

817
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,020
哈克南家族的人数远超过厄崔迪家族

818
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:14,350
厄崔迪军团是整个帝国中最出色的
Atreides legions are the finest in the Imperium.

819
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:18,150
由哥尼哈莱克 邓肯艾达荷训练
Trained by Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho.

820
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,280
我们是萨多卡军团

821
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,150
皇帝的精锐部队

822
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,030
和我们作对的人绝没好下场

823
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,030
没错
Just so.

824
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,160
三个营 约定好的
Three battalions. As agreed.

825
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,750
皇帝下令 自当奉命行事

826
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,790
关于保罗 我有事要告诉你
There is something you need to know about Paul.

827
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,830
不
No.

828
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,330
我并不想知道
Don't think I want to know.

829
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:22,170
自从你的圣母来过后 他就变得不一样了
Ever since you brought him before your Reverend Mother, he hasn't been the same.

830
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,340
变得心神不宁
He's distracted.

831
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:30,260
杰西卡 你给了我一个儿子
Jessica, you gave me a son.

832
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,770
打从他出生 我从没质疑过你
And from the moment he was born, I never questioned you.

833
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,680
我毫无保留地信任你
I trusted you completely.

834
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,270
即便你背着我行事
Even when you walked in shadows.

835
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,940
现在我就问你一个问题
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

836
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,570
如果真的有事
If anything happens...

837
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,410
你会保护我们的儿子吗 
will you protect our son?

838
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,160
不惜我的性命
With my life.

839
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,160
我问的不是他的母亲
I'm not asking his mother.

840
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,830
而是贝尼杰瑟里特的一员
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

841
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,380
你会保护保罗吗 
Will you protect Paul?

842
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,550
你为什么会有这些想法 
Why are you having these thoughts?

843
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,180
雷托 这不像你
Leto, this is not you.

844
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,860
我以为我们还有时间
I thought we'd have more time.

845
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,840
睡个好觉 保罗少主
Have a good night, Master Paul.

846
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,760
晚安 岳医生
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

847
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,350
你需要好好睡一觉
You need to sleep.

848
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:04,230
不 我不想靠那个
No. Not like that.

849
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,830
我应该娶你的
I should have married you.

850
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,250
杜菲 叫侍卫
Hawat. Security.

851
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:45,710
侍卫
Security.

852
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,690
长官
Sir. Sir.

853
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,900
防护盾失灵了
The shield's come down.

854
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:57,530
动作快 拿上武器 快跟上

855
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,620
见鬼
God in heaven.

856
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:07,210
启动所有武装飞行器 快走
Get everything with guns off the ground! Go!

857
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,450
冲啊
Go! Go! Go!

858
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,160
去那儿 小心了

859
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:52,840
快走

860
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,020
跟我走
With me! With me!

861
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,360
一起上

862
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,390
厄崔迪 厄崔迪
Atreides! Atreides!

863
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,710
是萨多卡军团
- Sardaukar! - Sardaukar!

864
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:24,190
抱歉 公爵大人
I'm sorry, my lord.

865
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,830
我和男爵做了个交易
But I've made a bargain with the Baron.

866
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,700
为什么 
Why?

867
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,960
我别无选择
I had no choice.

868
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,170
哈克南人抓了我妻子 瓦娜
The Harkonnens have my wife, Wanna.

869
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,170
他们把她当玩具一样折磨
They take her apart like a doll.

870
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,630
我要把她救出来
I will buy her freedom.

871
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,550
用你做交换
And you are the price.

872
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:54,270
对于保罗 我会尽可能帮他
For Paul. I will do what I can.

873
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:58,520
而你 我要你替我杀一个人
And you will kill a man for me.

874
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:06,530
我会替你换掉你的锥形牙
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

875
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,240
只要你用力一咬
If you bite down hard,

876
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:10,570
这颗牙就会碎裂
this tooth will crush.

877
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,620
呼口气 空气中就将充满毒气
Breathe out, and you will fill the air with poison.

878
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:18,250
那将是你的最后一口气
It will be your last breath.

879
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:21,290
但如果你选的时机准确
But if you choose your moment well,

880
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,760
那也将是男爵的最后一口
it will also be the Baron's.

881
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,390
保罗
Paul.

882
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,030
一会儿把他们扔到沙漠里去

883
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,580
让沙虫吃掉他们

884
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:23,210
为什么不直接杀了他们

885
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:27,800
因为我们要面对一个真言师

886
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,470
我们可以说我们没有杀他们

887
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,390
有疤的那个是聋子

888
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,310
去死吧 走狗们
To hell, dogs!

889
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,950
我从没和贵族试过
I've never had a highborn.

890
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:05,870
你呢 
You?

891
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:08,410
贝尼杰瑟里特姐妹会算不上贵族
Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn.

892
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,130
对我来说 已经算是了
She's highborn enough for me.

893
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:16,420
把那孩子拿去喂沙虫 好好和她告别吧
Let's feed the kid to the worms. And give her a long goodbye.

894
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,670
你们敢动我母亲一下试试
Don't you dare touch my mother.

895
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:21,260
不许说话
Don't talk.

896
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,690
别乱来 你还没准备好

897
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,310
扯下她嘴上的布
Remove her gag.

898
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,280
闭嘴
Shut up.

899
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:48,080
找到正确的音调

900
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,630
走得够远了

901
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:59,090
把那个男孩儿丢下去吧

902
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,610
扯下她嘴上的布
Remove her gag.

903
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:22,780
杀了他
Kill him.

904
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,580
放了我们
Set us free.

905
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,180
住手
Stop!

906
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,810
割断绳子
Cut the rope.

907
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:52,940
把刀给我
Give me the knife.

908
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:04,910
你的音调 太刻意了
Your pitch was too forced.

909
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,080
是弗雷曼生存包
It's a fremkit.

910
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,600
他们损毁了飞船
They've crippled the ship.

911
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:07,150
你这儿的厨子还不错 表兄
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

912
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:27,380
这是岳医生的笔迹
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

913
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:30,510
如果有人活着逃出厄拉肯
"If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive,

914
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,890
生存包里有厄崔迪的信号器
there's an Atreides beacon in the fremkit.

915
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:34,930
但愿他们能找到你
God willing, they'll be able to find you."

916
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:46,650
男爵大人 岳医生到了
My lord Baron. Dr. Yueh.

917
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:47,940
那个叛徒
The traitor.

918
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:50,900
你想要什么 
What do you want?

919
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:53,570
我干扰了他们的通讯
I jammed their comms

920
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,120
解除了护盾
and lowered their shields.

921
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,910
还带来了公爵和他的家人
I delivered the Duke and his family.

922
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,040
和约定的一样
The bargain to the letter.

923
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,710
那我该为你做些什么 
And what was I to do for you?

924
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,630
放了我妻子 别再折磨她
Deliver my wife from her agony.

925
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:10,550
没错
Yes.

926
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:45,580
我说过会放了她
I said I'd set her free.

927
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:48,000
让你们团聚
That you could join her.

928
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:53,840
下去陪她吧
So, join her.

929
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,560
你觉得接下来该怎么做 
What do you think is next?

930
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:13,030
是沙槌 但没有蒸馏服
It's a thumper. No stillsuits.

931
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:15,410
那才是我们最需要的
The one thing we actually need.

932
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:23,500
几百年来 我们两家的仇恨不共戴天
For hundreds of years, we've traded blood for blood.

933
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,130
该结束了
But no more.

934
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:31,380
你的儿子死了 你的女人也跟着死了
Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead.

935
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:34,840
今晚厄崔迪家族就此陨落
Tonight the House of Atreides falls.

936
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:40,100
你的血脉将从此断绝
And your bloodline ends forever.

937
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:55,650
你说什么 
What did you say?

938
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:09,540
我既来此 必当永世留存
Here I am...here I remain.

939
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,440
凯恩斯
Kynes!

940
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:57,570
你待在这里不安全
It's not safe for you here.

941
01:36:57,650 --> 01:37:00,700
你会告诉兰兹拉德联合会 我们被出卖了吗 
Will you tell the Great Houses of the Landsraad how we were betrayed?

942
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,740
告诉他们我们的人是如何被杀害的 
How the best of them were murdered?

943
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,780
我接到的命令是保持沉默
I am commanded to say nothing.

944
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:08,540
什么都没看到
To see nothing.

945
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,500
皇帝是想我们来送死
The Emperor sent us here to die.

946
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:02,670
帐篷里有香料
There's spice in the tent.

947
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,390
这就是未来 它来了
That's the future. It's coming.

948
01:39:46,610 --> 01:39:50,740
生生不息的战火蔓延了整个宇宙
Holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire.

949
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,590
保罗 你在害怕 我能感受到
Paul, you're scared. I can see it.

950
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:08,010
告诉我你在害怕什么
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

951
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,560
谁来救救我 求你了
Somebody help me, please.

952
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,190
保罗
Paul.

954
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:29,030
我看到生生不息的战火
I see a holy war spreading across

955
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,320
蔓延了整个宇宙
the universe like unquenchable fire.

956
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:32,240
一名勇士以我父亲的名义
A warrior religion that waves

957
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,660
挥舞着厄崔迪家族的战旗
the Atreides banner in my father's name.

958
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:37,120
-保罗 -狂热的追随者聚集成众
Paul. Fanatical legions worshipping

959
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,460
祭拜我的父亲
at the shrine of my father's skull.

960
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:42,420
以我的名义所发动的战争
A war in my name!

961
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,960
每个人都在喊我的名字
Everyone's shouting my name!

962
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:46,090
保罗
Paul.

963
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,720
保罗厄崔迪
Paul Atreides.

964
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:54,640
你是你父亲的儿子 你是我的儿子
You are your father's son. You are my son.

965
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,560
你现在是保罗厄崔迪公爵
You are the Duke Paul Atreides.

966
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:01,190
你知道自己是谁 你知道你是谁

967
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:02,860
离我远点
Get off me!

968
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:05,440
这一切都怪你
You did this to me!

969
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,530
是你们姐妹会把我变成了怪物
You Bene Gesserit made me a freak!

970
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:35,350
我父亲死了

971

975
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:34,910
好了 我们走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

976

Here.

983
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:27,730
喝了这个
Drink this.

984
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:37,150
哈克南人同时袭击了
Harkonnens hit

985
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:38,700
这里所有人口密集的区域
every population center on the planet at once.

986
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:41,490
少说得要10个军团和上百艘飞船
There must have been 10 legions, hundreds of ships.

987
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,240
萨多卡军团也参与了 至少有两个营
There were Sardaukar with them. -At least two battalions.

988
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:46,290
你确定吗 
-What? Are you sure?

989
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:48,580
只要你和他们交过手
You cross swords with a Sardaukar,

990
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,580
你就会知道
you know it.

991
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,960
所以 皇帝做出了选择
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

992
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,920
裁决官你又怎么说 
What says the Judge of the Change?

993
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,760
皇帝禁止我透露任何消息
The Emperor forbids me from saying anything at all.

994
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:03,220
可你还是冒着危险来帮我们
And yet you risk your life to help us.

995
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,860
动作快 遮好飞船

996
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:24,780
飓沙暴要来了
Storm's coming.

997
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:42,720
沙暴几小时后就会到达 这里很安全
The storm will be here in a few hours. We'll be safe here.

998
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:45,720
知道这是什么地方吗 
Do you know what this place is?

999
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:48,850
一个早期建造的生态试验站
It's an old ecological testing station.

1000
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:53,980
他们本想改造这颗星球
They were meant to tame the planet.

1001
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:56,320
把沙子下面的水释放出来
Free the water locked beneath the sands.

1002
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:01,650
厄拉科斯本可以是个天堂
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

1003
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,120
然而工程刚开始 他们就发现了香料
The work had begun, but then the spice was discovered.

1004
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:07,950
于是没人再提移除沙漠的事
And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away.

1005
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,790
坦纳 找几件适合客人穿的蒸馏服
Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors?

1006
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,080
是 列特
Yes, Liet.

1007
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:14,000
沙米尔 来几杯咖啡好吗 
Shamir, a coffee service, please.

1008
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,210
马上来 列特
Of course, Liet.

1009
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,380
你和弗雷曼人什么关系 
Who are you to the Fremen?

1010
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,520
知道各大家族最怕什么吗 凯恩斯博士 
You know what the Great Houses fear most, Dr. Kynes?

1011
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:16,230
正是发生在这儿的一切
Exactly what has happened to us here.

1012
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:20,610
被皇帝的萨多卡军团各个击破
The Sardaukar coming and picking them off one by one.

1013
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:26,530
只有团结他们才有可能对抗帝国
Only together can they stand a chance against the Imperium.

1014
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,280
你愿意当证人吗 
Would you bear witness?

1015
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:33,750
证明皇帝在这里对我们做的一切
Testify that the Emperor has moved against us here?

1016
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:36,420
如果他们相信我
If they believe me,

1017
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:41,130
各大家族和皇帝之间就会爆发全面战争
there would be general warfare between the Great Houses and the Emperor.

1018
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:42,460
战乱
Chaos

1019
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,260
席卷整个帝国
across the Imperium.

1020
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:47,680
要是我能给皇帝第二个选择呢 
Suppose I presented the Emperor with an alternative to chaos.

1021
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:52,260
皇帝没有儿子 他的女儿尚未出嫁
The Emperor has no sons. And his daughters have yet to marry.

1022
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:54,980
你是想要篡夺皇位吗 
You'd make a play for the throne?

1023
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,230
皇帝惧怕厄崔迪家族
The Emperor feared the Atreides.

1024
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:59,100
让你们来就是为了除掉你们
He brought you here to kill you.

1025
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,110
你怎么还不明白 
What don't you understand?

1026
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:04,690
你不过是个躲在地下不知所措的孩子
You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground.

1027
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:12,030
弗雷曼人提过李桑阿尔盖布
The Fremen speak of the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1028
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:13,740
别乱说话
Careful.

1029
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:17,960
意思是“天外之音” 能把他们带向天堂
The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to paradise.

1030
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,750
迷信而已
Superstition.

1031
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:27,340
我知道你曾爱过一名弗雷曼战士
I know you loved a Fremen warrior

1032
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:28,840
可他最后战死沙场
and lost him in battle.

1033
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:35,270
你有着多重身份 在两股势力之间周旋
I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names.

1034
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,400
我见过你的梦境
I've seen your dream.

1035
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:48,360
博士 如果我是皇帝
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1036
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:51,490
我只要挥挥手就能把厄拉科斯变成天堂
I could make a paradise of Arrakis with a wave of my hand.

1037
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,120
你真觉得他是天选之人吗

1038
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,290
他看起来太年轻了

1039
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:49,020
萨多卡军团
Sardaukar!

1040
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:53,150
不要 邓肯
No! Duncan!

1041
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:54,150
保罗 不要
Paul, no!

1042
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,530
-邓肯 -不要
- Duncan, no! - No!

1043
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,580
-不 -保罗 回来
- No! - Paul, no!

1044
01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:00,790
邓肯 不要
Duncan, no!

1045
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,160
-他把门锁上了 -不
- He's locked the door. - Duncan! No!

1046
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,210
他死了
He's gone.

1047
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:55,010
邓肯
Duncan!

1048
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:57,050
我们得走了 我们别无选择
We have to go. We have no choice.

1049
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,810
保罗 快跑 保罗
Paul, go! Paul!

1050
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:28,040
快跑 跟上
Come on. Come on, come on!

1051
01:52:59,570 --> 01:53:00,530
跟着光走
Follow the light.

1052
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,660
你们会看到一架扑翼机
You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

1053
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,120
外面的飓沙暴是你们最好的掩护
That storm out there is your best shot.

1054
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:07,750
到了5000米以上基本就全是尘土
Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust.

1055
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:09,580
飞上去 保持高度
Climb into it. Stay on top.

1056
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:11,630
一直往南 去找弗雷曼人
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1057
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:12,750
你不跟我们一起吗 
Are you not coming with us?

1058
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,090
飞行器只有两个位子
It only seats two.

1059
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:15,920
我会去下一个试验站
I'll go to the next station

1060
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:17,840
然后向兰兹拉德联合会报告
and report this attack to the Landsraad.

1061
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:18,800
怎么去 
How?

1062
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:20,970
我是弗雷曼人
I'm Fremen.

1063
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:23,300
沙漠是我的家
The desert's my home.

1064
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,220
-一切顺利 -你也是
Good luck. Good luck.

1065
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:07,090
凯恩斯 你背叛了皇帝

1066
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:09,890
我只效忠于一个主人
I serve only one master.

1067
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:11,310
他就是
His name is

1068
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,560
沙漠之主
Shai-Hulud.

1069
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:00,480
后面有飞机跟着
There are jet flares behind us.

1070
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:36,220
保罗 高度还不够
Paul. We're not high enough!

1071
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:09,800
绝不能恐惧
I must not fear.

1072
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:11,630
恐惧是思维的杀手
Fear is the mind-killer.

1073
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:14,970
恐惧是最终导致灭亡的死神
Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.

1074
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:24,150
去见朋友
See the friend.

1075
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:31,280
去见朋友
See the friend.

1076
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:36,580
人生的奥秘并不是去解决某个问题
The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve...

1077
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,910
而是去经历眼前的现实
but a reality to experience.

1078
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:48,750
如果你停滞不前便永远无法参透它
A process that cannot be understood by stopping it.

1079
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,260
跟着它的起伏 随波逐流
We must move with the flow of the process.

1080
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,890
勇敢地踏入其中
We must join it.

1081
01:58:56,010 --> 01:58:57,430
随之而动
We must flow with it.

1082
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,850
放手
Let go.

1083
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:03,770
放手
Let go.

1084
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,760
他的伤势还没有痊愈

1085
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,190
我们的人追着他们飞进了飓沙暴
We chased them into a Coriolis storm.

1086
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:56,110
风速达到800公里每小时
Winds at 800 kilometers an hour.

1087
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:02,830
这种情况不可能幸存
Nothing survives such a storm.

1088
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:04,410
他们死定了
They're dead.

1089
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:07,420
毋庸置疑
It's a certainty.

1090
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:17,260
总算了结了
So, it's done. Finally.

1091
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:21,390
给桀迪主星那边传话
Send word to Giedi Prime

1092
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:24,020
开始销售我们储备的香料
to begin selling our spice reserves.

1093
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:26,270
但是要慢
But slowly.

1094
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:29,440
我不想看到价格下跌
We don't want the price to fall.

1095
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:31,860
你不知道我费了多少劲
You have no idea how much it cost me

1096
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:33,820
才拉拢了萨多卡军团
to bring such a force to bear here.

1097
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,490
我现在只有一个要求
Now I only have one requirement.

1098
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,490
回报
Income.

1099
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,160
去榨干他们 拉班
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1100
02:00:41,620 --> 02:00:43,120
有多少赚多少
Squeeze hard.

1101
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,290
是 叔叔
Yes, Uncle.

1102
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:47,660
那弗雷曼人怎么办 
And the Fremen?

1103
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,960
统统杀掉
Kill them all.

1104
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:06,230
魁萨茨哈德拉克 站起来 觉醒吧

1105
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:15,440
已经升到5000米以上了
We're above 5,000 meters.

1106
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:55,170
一着陆就往岩石上跑
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

1107
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:49,280
用这个来呼吸
And breathe through this.

1108
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:21,860
现在要去找弗雷曼人
Now we have to find the Fremen.

1109
02:05:23,610 --> 02:05:24,650
你还好吗 
Are you good?

1110
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:26,110
没事
Yeah.

1111
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:20,290
跟着那个朋友

1112
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:44,770
不要感到害怕
Don't be frightened.

1113
02:06:45,770 --> 02:06:48,940
就连小小的沙鼠都能活下来
Even a little desert mouse can survive.

1114
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:54,910
不要感到害怕 你必须面对你的恐惧
Don't be frightened. You'll need to face your fears.

1115
02:06:55,070 --> 02:06:57,030
一位朋友…
A friend...

1116
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:00,160
一位朋友会帮助你
A friend will help you.

1117
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,790
跟着那位朋友
Follow the friend.

1118
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:07,840
你要学的还有很多
You have much to learn.

1119
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:12,130
我来教你如何在沙漠里生存
And I will show you the ways of the desert.

1120
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:16,720
跟我走吧
Come with me.

1121
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:47,840
地下城 邓肯在那儿住过
The sietch where Duncan lived

1122
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:50,170
应该就在前边
is somewhere off that way.

1123
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:55,090
我看到了绿色植被
I can see greenery over there.

1124
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:56,800
在那儿
There.

1125
02:07:57,090 --> 02:07:59,100
说明弗雷曼人就住那儿
That means Fremen live there.

1126
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:05,270
等天黑了再穿过去
We'll cross after dark.

1127
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:07,480
弗雷曼人就是这么干的
That's how the Fremen do it.

1128
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:12,940
就快进入沙虫的领地了
We're about to enter worm territory.

1129
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:15,240
我们不能像普通人那么走路
We can't walk like regular humans.

1130
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:16,860
那样做 我们就死定了
If we do, we're dead.

1131
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:20,410
得像弗雷曼人那样 走沙地微步
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do. It's called a sandwalk.

1132
02:08:20,870 --> 02:08:23,120
至少家里的百科全书上是这么说的
At least according to the filmbooks back home.

1133
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:24,620
好的 明白了
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1134
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:26,370
好的 跟着我
Okay. Follow me.

1135
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:27,670
像我这样走
Do the same moves.

1136
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,060
方向应该没错
I think this is the right direction.

1137
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:08,980
它就在附近 我们快走
It's close by. Let's get out of here.

1138
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:12,230
等等
Wait.

1139
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:15,400
是鼓沙
It's drum sand.

1140
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:21,280
快跑
run.

1141
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:29,540
快跑
Go! Go!

1142
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,690
是沙槌
It's a thumper.

1143
02:11:47,950 --> 02:11:49,620
有人启动了沙槌
Someone set off a thumper.

1144
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:06,510
保罗 快跑
Paul! Run!

1145
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:24,070
它们究竟有多大 刚才太恐怖了
How big are they? That was insane.

1146
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:29,660
有人引开了它
Someone called it.

1147
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:42,460
这里还有别人

1148
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:03,820
不要跑
Do not run.

1149
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:08,110
那样只会耗费你们身上的水分
You will only waste your body's water.

1150
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:09,910
慢着
Hold.

1151
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:18,170
斯第尔格
Stilgar.

1152
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:20,670
嘿 你认识我
Hey! You know me.

1153
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:23,000
你来找我父亲时我也在场
I was there when you came to my father's Council.

1154
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,840
这位是公爵的儿子
This is the Duke's son.

1155
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:29,390
你还在等什么  我们需要他们的水分
Why are you waiting? We need their water.

1156
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:32,050
这就是我和你们提过的男孩儿
This is the boy I told you about.

1157
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:33,430
我们不能动他
We can't touch him.

1158
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:36,520
他怎么会是李桑阿尔盖布

1159
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:37,980
他还没有证明自己

1160
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:39,020
他们是弱者
They are weaklings.

1161
02:13:39,230 --> 02:13:40,100
詹米
Jamis.

1162
02:13:41,110 --> 02:13:44,900
他们俩从沙漠之主的眼皮底下来到这里
That was a brave crossing they made in the path of  Shai-Hulud.

1163
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:48,820
我并不觉得他是一个懦弱的人
He does not speak or act like a weakling.

1164
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:51,660
他父亲也一样
Nor did his father.

1165
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:53,990
是我的沙槌救了他
My thumper saved his life.

1166
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:56,830
理智一点 斯第尔格
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1167
02:13:57,250 --> 02:13:58,500
他不是天选之人
He's not The One.

1168
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,090
我们有许多有权势的朋友
We have powerful friends.

1169
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:06,460
你们帮我们离开这里 去卡拉丹
You help us off-world, to Caladan,

1170
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,090
到时候一定重重有赏
you will be well rewarded.

1171
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:12,340
有什么比你们身体里的水分更值钱 
What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh?

1172
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:20,940
那小子还小 可以慢慢培养
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

1173
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,190
他可以留下来
He may have sanctuary.

1174
02:14:24,190 --> 02:14:26,940
但那个女的 没受过训练
But the woman is untrained...

1175
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:31,110
岁数太大 没法训练
and too old to learn.

1176
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:04,520
退后 你们这群蠢货
back, you dogs.

1177
02:15:05,650 --> 02:15:07,320
她会割了我的喉咙
She'll cut my throat.

1178
02:15:12,910 --> 02:15:16,740
为什么不说清楚你受过训练  是个女战士 
Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman? And a fighter?

1179
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:19,120
你们给我机会说了吗 
Conversation ran short.

1180
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:21,290
冷静点 女人
Peace, woman.

1181
02:15:21,710 --> 02:15:23,000
冷静点
Peace.

1182
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:25,630
我刚才太武断了
I judged hastily.

1183
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:36,140
太阳就快升起

1184
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:38,890
我们必须回地下城去

1185
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:42,980
等回去后再决定这两个人的命运

1186
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:50,400
在那之前

1187
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:52,990
他们会得到我的庇护

1188
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:56,740
这是我的承诺

1189
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:06,920
我不会让你伤害我的朋友
I would not have let you hurt my friends.

1190
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:34,030
他们说你是救世主
They say you're the  Mahdi.

1191
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:36,780
我看你只是个孩子罢了
But you look like a little boy.

1192
02:16:38,370 --> 02:16:39,780
你选了条最难的路爬上来
You chose the hardest way up.

1193
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,950
跟着我
Follow me.

1194
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:46,500
我们得走了

1195
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:49,830
把它给我
Give it to me.

1196
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,300
等你有资格时 自然会得到毛拉枪
You will have your own maula pistol when you've earned it.

1197
02:17:01,350 --> 02:17:02,390
把它给我
Give it to me.

1198
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:10,110
契妮 照顾好这两个新来的
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.

1199
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,480
确保他们一路安全 走吧
See that they are safe on the journey. Let's go.

1200
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:14,230
我不接受他们
I will not have them.

1201
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:21,990
詹米
Jamis,

1202
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:24,830
我已经说过了 别乱来
I have spoken. Be still.

1203
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:26,910
你说得自己像个领袖一样
You talk like a leader.

1204
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:29,830
但最强的才有资格领导
But the strongest leads.

1205
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:32,170
她打败了你
She bested you.

1206
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,800
我现在要求决斗
I invoke the amtal.

1207
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:38,840
你不能挑战萨亚迪娜女祭司
You may not challenge a Sayyadina.

1208
02:17:38,970 --> 02:17:40,470
那就找个人代她出战
Then who will fight in her name?

1209
02:17:40,590 --> 02:17:42,760
詹米 别闹了
Jamis, don't do this.

1210
02:17:43,350 --> 02:17:45,350
够了 黑夜就要过去了
Don't. The night is fading.

1211
02:17:45,470 --> 02:17:48,180
那就让太阳见证这场决斗
Then the sun will witness this death.

1212
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:50,190
她的勇士在哪儿 
Where is her champion?

1213
02:18:01,490 --> 02:18:02,870
我接受这个人选
I accept her champion.

1214
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:39,490
保罗厄崔迪必须死去
Paul Atreides must die...

1215
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:45,830
为了魁萨茨哈德拉克的崛起
for  Kwisatz Haderach  to rise.

1216
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:51,620
不要感到害怕
Don't be frightened.

1217
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:54,380
也不要抗拒
Don't resist.

1218
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:05,390
如果终将夺人性命 那就选择你自己
When you take a life, you take your own.

1219
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:38,800
我虽然不信你是天外之音
I don't believe you're the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1220
02:19:40,630 --> 02:19:42,380
但我仍然希望你死得有尊严
But I want you to die with honor.

1221
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:56,860
这把晶牙匕是我姑婆给我的
This crysknife was given to me by my great aunt.

1222
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:02,280
是由沙漠之主的牙齿制成的
It's made from a tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

1223
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:04,070
神圣的沙虫
The great sandworm.

1224
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,450
拿着它 死了也是有尊严的
This will be a great honor, for you to die holding it.

1225
02:20:13,210 --> 02:20:15,210
异星人在哪里 
Where is the Outworlder?

1226
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:21,300
詹米是个出色的战士
Jamis is a good fighter.

1227
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:23,800
你不会太痛苦
He won't let you suffer.

1228
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:26,590
契妮
Chani...

1229
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:31,680
没什么
Um...

1230
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:40,820
没什么
Never mind.

1231
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:38,290
愿你刀毁人亡
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1232
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:48,260
你应该感谢我的刀
You should welcome my blade.

1233
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,470
这个世界会要了你的小命
This world will kill you.

1234
02:21:56,850 --> 02:21:58,390
这样一来反倒干脆
Quicker this way.

1235
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:39,230
认不认输 
Do you yield?

1236
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:44,060
这孩子不懂我们的规矩
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1237
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,440
决斗中没有认输的余地
There's no yielding under the amtal rule.

1238
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:48,860
不是你死就是我亡
Only death is the test of it.

1239
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:58,120
他是在戏弄他吗 
-Is he toying with him?

1240
02:22:58,290 --> 02:22:59,120
不
-No.

1241
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:01,870
保罗从没杀过人
Paul has never killed a man.

1242
02:23:12,930 --> 02:23:16,850
魁萨茨哈德拉克
Kwisatz Haderach.

1243
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:26,770
魁萨茨哈德拉克 站起来 觉醒吧
Kwisatz Haderach. Climb up. Rise.

1244
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,310
你是我们的一员了
You're one of us now.

1245
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:23,060
一命换一命
A life for a life.

1246
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:25,520
跟我们走 去地下城
Come with us to  Sietch  Tabr.

1247
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:26,520
不
No.

1248
02:25:26,810 --> 02:25:28,230
保罗必须离开这里
Paul needs to get off-world.

1249
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,650
你一定有办法 你们中有走私徒
You must have ways. You have smugglers,

1250
02:25:30,770 --> 02:25:32,860
-你们有飞船 你们还有… -不
you have ships. - No. - You have...

1251
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:39,160
皇帝派我们来这里 我父亲来了
The Emperor sent us to this place. And my father came,

1252
02:25:40,030 --> 02:25:43,870
不是为了香料 也不是为了财富
not for spice, not for the riches,

1253
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:46,790
为的是弗雷曼人的力量
but for the strength of your people.

1254
02:25:50,130 --> 02:25:52,000
命运指引我走向沙漠
My road leads into the desert.

1255
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:56,090
我能看见
I can see it.

1256
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:00,390
只要你们愿意接受我们
If you'll have us,

1257
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,470
我们就跟你们走
we will come.

1258
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:52,770
沙漠的力量
Desert power.

1259
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:55,900
一切才刚开始
This is only the beginning.

1260
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:34,480
（改编自弗兰克赫伯特著作《沙丘》）

1261
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:48,510
沙丘
