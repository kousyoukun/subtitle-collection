在沙滩上翻滚……
Rolling over the sands…

6
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:08,501
你可以在空气中看到香料 
You can see spice in the air.

7
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,642
傍晚时分 香料收割者们着陆了 
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

8
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:30,898
外面的人争分夺秒地躲避白天的炎热 
The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day.

9
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:43,828
他们当着我们的面蹂躏我们的土地 
They ravage our lands in front of our eyes.

10
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:47,498
我只知道他们虐待我的人民 
Their cruelty to my people is all I've known.

11
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,882
这些外来者 哈科宁家族 早在我出生之前就来了 
These outsiders, The Harkonnens, came long before I was born.

12
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,678
通过控制香料生产 他们变得非常富有 
By controlling the spice production they became obscenely rich.

13
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,514
比皇帝本人还富有 
Richer than the Emperor himself.

14
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:48,851
我们的战士没能从哈科宁手中救出阿拉基斯 
Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

15
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:53,230
但是有一天 根据皇帝的命令 他们消失了 
but one day, by imperial decree, they were gone.

16
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:06,410
为什么皇帝选择了这条路?下一个压迫者是谁?
Why did the Emperor choose this path? And who our next oppressors be?

强大到足以穿透金属的沙暴 
With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through the metal.

00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:59,875
只有被称为弗里曼人的土著部落能够很好地适应并生存下来 
Only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive.

38
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:04,964
弗里曼人更喜欢居住在阿拉基斯最偏远的地区 
Preferring to inhabit the remotest regions of Arrakis

39
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,634

43
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,439
关于弗里曼人的其他信息很少 
Little else is known of the Fremen,

44
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:25,651
除了他们是危险和不可靠的

45
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,740
弗莱明的攻击使香料收获变得极其危险 
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting extremely hazardous.

46
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:35,369
对弗里曼人来说 香料就是神圣的迷幻剂
For the Fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen

47
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:39,206
它能保护生命 带来巨大的健康益处

使之成为宇宙中最有价值的物质

皇帝已经说过了:
The Emperor has spoken:

62
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:48,095
厄崔迪家族将立即接管阿拉基斯

63
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,338

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,787
-是吗? -稳定器太松了 
-How was it? -The stabilizers are too loose.

那太糟糕了 因为不 
That's too bad, cause no.

81
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,523
邓肯……
Duncan…

82
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,069

和弗里曼人

So I do find them? There you go. That's a good omen right there, right?

90
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,073
兰维尔！

91
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:15,000
我看见你躺着死了 在战斗中倒下

92
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:21,173
我觉得如果我在那里 你就不会死

93
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,919
首先 我不会死

-你没把我当回事 -这就是你想跟我一起来的原因?
-You're not taking me seriously. -That's why you wanna come with me?

95
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,476
听着 梦是好的故事 
Listen, dreams make good stories,

96
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,343
但重要的事情都是在我们醒着的时候发生的 
but everything important happens when we're awake,

97
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,448
因为那是我们创造奇迹的地方 
because that's where we make things happen.

98
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,693
-看看你 长点肌肉？-是吗？

99
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,111
不 
No.

100
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,243
阿拉基斯见 我的孩子

父亲 我想加入邓肯·爱达荷
Father, I'd like to ask to join Duncan Idaho

102
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:28,907
明天去阿拉基斯的侦察任务 
on a scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow.

103
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,748
我学过弗里曼语言 我会成为一个有用的人 
I've studied the Fremen language. I'd be an asset.

104
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:33,004
不可能 
Out of the question.

105
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:35,602
几周后你会像我们一样去阿拉基斯 
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis like the rest of us.

106
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,663
我这辈子都在训练 如果我不能……
I've been training my whole life… What is the point if I'm not allowed--

107
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,422
你知道为什么 保罗 你是厄崔迪家族的未来 
You know why, Paul. You're the future of the House Atreides.

108
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,715
祖父为了运动和公牛搏斗 
And grandfather fought bulls for sport.

109
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:49,219
是的 看看他的下场 
Yes, look where that got him.

110
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:58,979
我需要你在我身边 当我们到达阿拉基斯时 我们将面临巨大的危险 
I need you by my side. When we get to Arrakis we'll face enormous danger.

111
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:02,691
什么危险？弗里曼人？沙漠？
What danger? The Fremen? The desert?

112
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,027
政治风险 
Political danger.

113
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:11,992
王室指望我们来领导这威胁到了皇帝 
The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the Emperor.

114
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,454
把阿拉基斯从哈康人手中夺走 归我们所有
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours

115
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,000
他为一场削弱两院的战争做了铺垫 
he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses.

116
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:25,255
但如果我们坚定立场 利用阿拉基斯真正的力量
But if we hold firm and tap the true power of Arrakis

117
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,674
我们可以变得更强大 
we could be stronger than ever.

118
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:28,986
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

119
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,005
采矿香料 让弗雷曼家族安分守舍?
Mining spice, keeping the Fremen in their place?

120
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:33,516
我们不会比哈科宁强多少 
We'd be no better than Harkonnens.

121
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:37,517
不 通过与弗里曼人结盟 
No. By making an alliance with the Fremen.

122
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:42,147
这就是我让邓肯·爱达荷去安排的 
That's what I've sent Duncan Idaho to arrange.

123
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:46,151
这里 在卡拉丹 我们依靠空中和海上力量统治 
Here, on Caladan, we've ruled by air power and sea power.

124
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,113
在阿拉基斯 我们需要培育沙漠力量 
On Arrakis, we need to cultivate desert power.

125
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,328
我想让你参加我的长老会 了解我的工作 
I want you sitting in on my council, learn what I do.

126
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,039
如果我不是呢 爸爸?
What if I'm not, dad?

127
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:02,709
不是什么?
Not what?

128
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:05,295
厄崔迪家族的未来 
The future of the House Atreides.

129
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:21,394
我告诉我父亲我也不想这样 
I told my father I didn't want this either.

130
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:28,527
-我想当飞行员 -你从没跟我说过

You chose to train him in the Way in defiance of the rule.

250

He wields our power. He had to be tested to the limits.

251
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,586
在男性身上浪费了这么多的潜力 
So much potential wasted in the male.

252
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:33,285
你被告知只生女儿 
You were told to bear only daughters,

253
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,811
但你和你的骄傲以为你能制造出奎维兹·哈达拉赫

254
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,158
是我错了吗?
Was I wrong?

255
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:40,560
他没死在那间屋子里算你走运 
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

如果他是那个人 他还有很长的路要走 
If he is The One he has a long way to go.

257
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,843
他的视力刚刚苏醒 现在他被扔进了火里

258
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,349
但我们的计划是以世纪为单位的 
But our plans are measured in centuries.

259
00:29:50,437 --> 00:29:52,450
我们还有其他的前景
We have other prospects

260
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:54,057
如果他没有信守诺言 
if he fails his promise.

261
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,522
你看到的希望如此渺茫吗?
Do you see so little hope?

262
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:02,775
在阿拉基斯 我们已经尽力了 
On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you.

Paul…

265
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:59,290
这是什么意思?

00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:08,127
但阿拉基斯就是阿拉基斯 
But Arrakis is Arrakis,

399
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:11,339
沙漠带走了弱者 
and the desert takes the weak.

400
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:14,842
我的沙漠 
My desert.

401
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:18,805
我的阿拉基斯 
My Arrakis.

402
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:23,560
我的沙丘 
My dune.

403
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,722
你的第一次战略会议 
Your first strategy meeting.

404
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:34,320
保罗·阿特里德斯 他赤手空拳抓住了寻猎者就像一个英雄 
Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers in his bare hands like a hero of all.

405
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,449
-谢谢你羞辱我 老家伙 -我会盯着你的 
-Thanks for the humiliation, old man. -I'll keep an eye on you.

406
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:40,618
注意!
Attention!

407
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:51,004
让我们开始吧 
Let's get started.

408
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:54,674
苏菲尔 操作 
Thufir, operations.

409
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:59,178
我拿到了一份哈科宁的账簿 
I've secured a copy of the Harkonnen's account books.

410
00:49:59,345 --> 00:50:04,517
哈科宁人每年从这里拿走100亿日光 
The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion solaris out of here every year.

411
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,946
“他们要吸取丰富的海洋
"They shall suck at the abundance of the seas

412
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:08,803
还有藏在沙子里的宝藏 ”
and on the treasures hidden in the sand."

413
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:11,231
短期内我们不会看到这样的利润 
We won't see profits like that for a while,

414
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:13,417
用他们留给我们的设备就不行 
not with the equipment they left us.

415
00:50:14,402 --> 00:50:15,987
情况有多糟?
How bad is it?

416
00:50:22,076 --> 00:50:23,734
这些是香料筒仓 
These are spice silos.

417
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:27,844
我们要把每条板条箱都装满 
We are meant to fill every crate.

418
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,335
都是吗？
All of them?

419
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:32,381
每25个标准天 
Every 25 standard days.

420
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,878
哈科宁的破坏行动拖了我们的后腿 
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

421
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:37,378
但是谁来仲裁呢?
But who's meant to arbitrate?

422
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,045
难道就没有一个变革的法官来监督这个转变吗?
Isn't there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition?

423
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:44,390
-皇帝任命了谁？-列特·凯恩斯博士 帝国生态学家 
-Who did the Emperor appoint? -Dr. Liet Kynes, imperial ecologist.

424
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:47,727
我在这里已经20年了 跟别人告诉我的不一样 
Been here 20 years. Eccentric from what I'm told.

425
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:50,417
我想亲眼看看这些收获地 
I want to see these harvesting fields myself.

426
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,228
我不建议你这么做 大人 
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

427
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:55,256
让这位变化的法官陪着我们 
Have this Judge of the Change accompany us.

428
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,919
我们的会议早该举行了 
Our meeting is long overdue.

429
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:59,115
我们会得到一点帝国的保护 
And we'll get a bit of imperial protection.

430
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,655
人质？我喜欢 
A hostage? I love it.

431
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:06,287
他来了 大人
He's here, my lord

432
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:31,229
照顾好他们 他们是朋友 
Take care of them, they are friends.

433
00:51:31,396 --> 00:51:33,773
邓肯!-我的孩子!
-Duncan! -My boy!

434
00:51:39,654 --> 00:51:43,032
-我发誓你长高了 -嗯 你闻起来更臭了 
-I swear you're getting taller. -Well, you smell much worse.

435
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,360
我和弗里曼人住了四周 
For four weeks I've lived with the Fremen,

436
00:51:48,513 --> 00:51:50,968
藏在沙漠里 在一个叫做西斯的社区里 
hidden in the desert, in the community called the sietch.

437
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:54,085
斯蒂格 那个西斯的首领跟我来见你了 先生 
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch has come with me to meet you, sir.

438
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:57,964
-这个西斯是怎么藏起来的? -是在地下 
-This sietch, how was it hidden? -It's under ground.

439
00:51:58,131 --> 00:51:59,953
阿拉基斯到处都是洞穴 
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

440
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:01,239
那地方有多大?
How big was the place?

441
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:05,763
这里有一万人 还有几百个西斯 
It's a ten thousand people, and there are hundreds of sietches.

442
00:52:06,848 --> 00:52:10,226
数以百万计的弗里曼人n 你是对的 
Millions of Fremen. You were right.

443
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:14,230
哈科宁估计整个星球上有五万人 
The Harkonnen estimate was fifty thousand on the whole planet.

444
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,859
弗里曼人看着我找了好几天 我从没见过他们 
The Fremen watched me search for them for days. I never saw them.

445
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:20,560
最后 他们派了一个战士来杀我 
Finally, they sent a warrior out to kill me,

446
00:52:21,112 --> 00:52:24,600
我必须告诉你 我从未如此接近死亡 
and I have to tell you, I've never come so close to dying.

447
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:27,418
帝国里没有比他更好的战士了 
There's no finer fighter in the Imperium.

448
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:31,706
-他们像恶魔一样战斗 -沙漠的力量 
-They fight like demons. -Desert power.

449
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:37,253
邓肯 做得好 -谢谢您 大人 
-Duncan, well done. -Thank you, my lord.

450
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,340
长官 他们的首领有把刀他不会投降的 
Sir, their leader has a knife he won't surrender, sir.

451
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:44,300
是一把水晶刀 对他的族人来说是神圣的 
It's a crysknife, it's sacred to his people.

452
00:52:44,387 --> 00:52:46,100
让他过去 
Let him pass.

453
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:03,038
就此止步 
Stop there.

454
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:05,447
嘿!嘿!
Hey! Hey!

455
00:53:10,912 --> 00:53:14,165
斯蒂尔加 欢迎 
Stilgar, welcome.

456
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:20,588
先生 我尊重任何尊重我的人的人格尊严 
Sir, I respect the personal dignity of any man that respects mine.

457
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:29,272
拿着 
Hold.

458
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:34,790
谢谢你 斯蒂格 给了你身体水分 
Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture.

459
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,814
我们以给予它的精神接受它 
We accept it in the spirit in which it was given.

460
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,782
我很高兴你来了 
I'm glad you've come.

461
00:53:47,949 --> 00:53:51,702
我相信你们的人和我的人有很多可以互相提供的东西 
I believe your people and mine have much to offer one another.

462
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:54,606
你们是外地人 你们来这里是为了香料
You are outworlders, you come here for the spice,

463
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:57,106
你拿走它 不付出任何回报 
You take it, giving nothing in return.

464
00:53:58,876 --> 00:53:59,778
这是真的 
That's true.

465
00:54:02,091 --> 00:54:04,627
我知道你被哈科宁折磨过 
I know you've suffered at the hands of the Harkonnen.

466
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:07,186
说出你想要的名字 
Name what you want.

467
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:10,593
如果在我的权力范围内 我会给予 不求任何回报 
If it's in my power to grant I'll give it and ask for nothing.

468
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,299
我要求的是：不要找我们的西斯 不要侵入我们的土地 
I ask for this: do not seek our sietches, do not trespass in our lands.

469
00:54:16,442 --> 00:54:19,718
早在你来之前 沙漠就属于我们了 
The desert was ours long before you came.

470
00:54:19,805 --> 00:54:21,387
所以 来挖出你的香料 
So, come and dig your spice,

471
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:25,138
但当你有了它 回到盾墙的这一边
but when you have it, go back to this side of the shield wall

472
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:26,855
把沙漠留给弗里曼人 
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

473
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:29,782
你要称呼公爵为“大人”或“先生” 
You will address the Duke as "my lord," or "sir."

474
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,285
格尼 等……等一下 
Gurney, just… Just a moment.

475
00:54:32,451 --> 00:54:38,249
皇帝把阿拉基斯作为我的封地交给我管理和保护 
The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief to rule and protect.

476
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:43,880
如果责任迫使我 我不能答应不去沙漠旅行 
I cannot promise not to travel into the desert if duty compels me.

477
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:47,216
但你的西斯将永远属于你 
But your sietches will be yours forever.

478
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:49,572
在我统治这里的时候你永远不会被追捕
and you will never be hunted while I govern here.

479
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:56,019
这很光荣 
That's very honorable.

480
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:57,347
我必须走了 
I must go.

481
00:54:57,435 --> 00:54:58,803
这就是我要对你说的 
That's all I have to say to you.

482
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,064
你为什么不留下来 我们将向您致敬 
Why don't you stay. We would honor you.

483
00:55:02,711 --> 00:55:06,152
法官要求我去别处 
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

484
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,947
我知道你是谁 
I know who you are.

485
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,791
-我不喜欢他 -我们的计划卓有成效 
-I don't like him. -Our plan bears fruit.

486
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,246
但这需要时间 
But it will take time.

487
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:26,633
是的 这需要时间 
Yes. It will take time.

488
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,052
给 这是给你的 
Here, this is for you.

489
00:55:35,056 --> 00:55:37,183
这是一个副罗盘 
It's a paracompass.

490
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,562
这里的卫星有磁场 所以简单的罗盘指针不会指向北方 
The moons here have a magnetic field, so a simple compass needle won't point north.

491
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,814
需要一个巧妙的发条装置来解决这个问题 
Takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out.

492
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:46,155
这些是弗雷曼人做的吗?
Do Fremen make these?

493
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:49,904
仍然适合 压砂机 和各种巧妙的东西 
And stillsuits, and sand compactors, and all kinds of ingenious things.

494
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:52,198
什么是压砂机?
What the hell is a sand compactor?

495
00:55:53,952 --> 00:55:55,099
那是一个压砂机 
That's a sand compactor.

496
00:55:57,202 --> 00:55:58,696
天啊 你已经变成乡巴佬了 
My God, man, you've gone native.

497
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:00,601
你欣赏他们 
You admire them.

498
00:56:01,832 --> 00:56:03,042
是的 
I do.

499
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,431
他们凶猛但忠诚 
They're fierce but loyal.

500
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:10,315
他们适应了沙漠 沙漠是他们的一部分 也是他们的一部分 
They're tuned into the desert, part of it, it's part of them.

501
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,718
你等着瞧吧 
You wait till you see it.

502
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:15,763
外面很美 
It's beautiful out there.

503
00:56:18,432 --> 00:56:20,935
日出警告 
Sunrise warning.

504
00:56:21,106 --> 00:56:25,231
温度高达140度 现在温度是90度 
…The temperature up to 140 degrees. The temperature now is 90 degrees.

505
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:29,777
但十分钟后气温会上升50度 
But it will rise 50 degrees in ten minutes.

506
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:31,487
最后一次警告 
Last warning.

507
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:06,897
法官的变化 先生 
The Judge of the Change, sir.

508
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:08,649
列特·凯恩斯博士 
Dr. Liet Kynes.

509
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:12,486
大人 公爵 欢迎来到阿拉基斯 
My Lord, Duke, welcome to Arrakis.

510
00:57:12,653 --> 00:57:14,502
你是帝国的生态学家 
You are the imperial ecologist.

511
00:57:14,649 --> 00:57:16,659
谢谢你的蒸馏服 
Thank you for the stillsuits.

512
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:19,910
这是弗里曼人做的 最好的 
They are Fremen make, the best.

513
00:57:20,077 --> 00:57:22,455
“如果您允许的话 先生 我必须检查一下完好……
With your permission, sir, I must check the integrity--

514
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:25,875
没关系 
It's all right.

515
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:29,128
没关系 
It's all right.

516
00:57:30,463 --> 00:57:33,424
凯恩斯医生 我们听你的了 
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

517
00:57:38,095 --> 00:57:43,225
蒸馏服是一种高效的过滤系统 
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system.

518
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:45,195
即使是这么早
Even this early in the morning

519
00:57:45,283 --> 00:57:47,676
没有这个你撑不过两小时 
you wouldn't survive two hours without one of these.

520
00:57:48,773 --> 00:57:53,836
它能使身体降温 并将流失的水分循环用于出汗 
It cools the body and recycles the water lost to sweat.

521
00:57:55,158 --> 00:57:57,286
你的身体动作提供了能量 
Your bodies movements provide the power.

522
00:57:58,324 --> 00:58:02,953
在面罩里面 你会发现一根管子 可以让你喝到循环水 
Inside the mask you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.

523
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,374
在良好的工作状态下 你的西装每天损失的水不会超过一顶针 
In good-working order your suit won't lose more than a thimble full of water a day.

524
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:09,376
非常令人印象深刻 
Most impressive.

525
00:58:10,419 --> 00:58:12,880
让我看看你 小伙子 
Let's have a look at you, lad.

526
00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:18,427
-你以前穿过蒸馏服吗? -没有 这是我的第一次 
-You've worn a stillsuit before? -No, this is my first time.

527
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:24,600
你的沙漠靴在脚踝处以一种滑脱的方式脱下来 谁教你这么做的?
Your desert boots off at a slip fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that?

528
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:27,311
这似乎是正确的方式 
It seemed the right way.

529
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:33,359
“他会知道他的习惯 就像他生来就知道一样 ”
"He will know his customs as if he was born with them."

530
00:58:35,152 --> 00:58:38,114
你是弗里曼人？
Are you a Fremen?

531
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,650
我在西斯和村里都被接纳了

532
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:42,802
现在 
Now.

533
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:47,665
来看看你赖以为生的香料沙吧 
Come and see the spice sands on which your livelihood depends.

534
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:28,581
如果你的扑翼机掉到这里 你会怎么做?
What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here?

535
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:32,376
你不会想去那里的 是蠕虫的领土 
You wouldn't want to go down out there. It's worm territory.

536
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,059
尘云 
Dust cloud.

537
00:59:37,506 --> 00:59:39,967
我看到了 
I see it.

538
00:59:40,134 --> 00:59:42,720
那是你的一辆矿车 
That's one of your harvesters.

539
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:11,290
你可以看到香料散布在表面 
You can see the spice scattered over the surface.

540
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:15,669
丰富的香料床的颜色 
Rich spice bed by the color.

541
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:18,368
如果你再高一点 你就能看得更清楚了 
If you get a little higher you'll have a better view.

542
01:00:33,312 --> 01:00:35,606
你看到这些侦察机在寻找蠕虫踪迹 
You see these spotter aircraft looking for worm sign.

543
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,026
蠕虫踪迹？
Worm sign?

544
01:00:39,193 --> 01:00:41,344
一股沙波向履带移动 
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

545
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:45,082
蠕虫在深处移动 但当它们攻击时 会更接近表面 
Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack.

546
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,287
如果你有耐心 我们会看到的 
If you are patient we should see one.

547

蠕虫总来？-是的 它们被有节奏的声音吸引 
-Worm always comes? -Always, they're drawn by rhythmic noises.

548
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,791
我们为什么不直接保护那些履带车呢?
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

549
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:59,665
在沙漠中 盾牌就是死刑 
A shield is a death sentence in the desert.

550
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,176
它吸引蠕虫 驱使它们疯狂地杀戮 
It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.

551
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:08,973
那是虫子吗?
Is that a worm?

552
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:20,711
大的

570

这是显而易见的 他们留给我们的一切都是一团糟 
It's plain to see. Everything they've left us is in shambles.

619
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:41,925
我们注定要失败 
We've been set up to fail.

620
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:47,639
那个载客太旧了 沙漠对设备不友好 
That carryall was just old. The desert isn't kind to equipment.

莱托 这不是你

-为什么? -我别无选择

哈科宁人抓走了我妻子 万娜

他们把她像洋娃娃一样拆开

我会为她赎身 而你就是代价

你会为我杀人

我要给你换一颗假牙

如果你用力咬 这颗牙就会碎裂 
If you bite them hard, this tooth will crash.

691
01:23:11,335 --> 01:23:15,339
呼出空气 你就会让空气充满毒素 
Breathe out, and you will fill the air with poison.

We will drop them in the desert, and leave them to the worms.

697
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:22,717
为什么不直接割了他们的喉咙呢?
Why not just cut their throats?

698
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:27,221
他们可能会使用真言者

699

那我们就可以诚实地说我们没杀他们

对我来说 她出身高贵 
She is high-born enough for me.

这是弗雷姆基特

他们把船弄坏了

01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:07,614
突然间 没人希望沙漠消失 
and suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away.

797
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:10,603
塔娜特 你能给我们的客人找件合身的衣服吗 
Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors.

798
01:46:10,707 --> 01:46:11,741
是 列特 
Yes, Liet.

799
01:46:11,829 --> 01:46:14,717
-沙米尔 请给我咖啡 -当然 列特 
-Shamir, coffee service, please. -Of course, Liet.

800
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:20,098
你是弗里曼的什么人?
Who are you to the Fremen?

801
01:47:09,063 --> 01:47:12,316
你知道大家族最害怕什么吗 凯恩斯博士?
Do you know what the great houses fear most, Dr. Kynes?

802
01:47:13,901 --> 01:47:16,654
我们这里发生的一切 
Exactly what has happened to us here.

803
01:47:16,821 --> 01:47:19,824
萨道卡尔人来了 一个接一个地干掉他们 
The Sardaukar coming and picking them off one by one.

804
01:47:22,827 --> 01:47:26,706
只有联合起来 他们才有机会对抗帝国 
Only together can they stand a chance against the Imperium.

805
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:29,638
你能作证吗?
Would you bare witness?

806
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,370
证明皇帝对我们采取了行动 
Testify that the Emperor has moved against us here.

807
01:47:33,671 --> 01:47:36,062
如果他们相信我……
If they believe me…

808
01:47:36,846 --> 01:47:40,466
大家族和皇帝之间将会有一场全面战争 
There would be general warfare between the great houses and the Emperor.

809
01:47:40,553 --> 01:47:43,598
整个帝国一片混乱 
Chaos across the Imperium.

810
01:47:43,765 --> 01:47:47,977
假设我给皇帝提供了一种替代混乱的方法 
Let's suppose I present to the Emperor with an alternative to chaos.

811
01:47:48,144 --> 01:47:51,689
皇帝没有儿子 他的女儿也还没有出嫁 
And the Emperor has no sons, and his daughters are yet to marry.

812
01:47:51,856 --> 01:47:54,642
你想篡夺王位?
You'd make a play for the throne?

813
01:47:55,099 --> 01:47:58,517
皇帝害怕阿特里德家族 他带你来是要杀你 
The Emperor feared the Atreides. He brought you here to kill you.

814
01:47:58,621 --> 01:48:00,524
你有什么不明白的?
What don't you understand?

815
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:04,118
你是一个躲在地洞里的迷失男孩 
You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground.

816
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:11,876
弗雷曼家族提到了利桑·盖布 
The Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib.

817
01:48:12,043 --> 01:48:13,669
小心点 
Careful.

818
01:48:13,836 --> 01:48:17,423
来自外部世界的声音 将带领他们进入天堂 
The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to paradise.

819
01:48:19,008 --> 01:48:19,969
迷信 
Superstition.

820
01:48:25,014 --> 01:48:29,227
我知道你爱一个弗里曼战士 在战斗中失去了他 
I know you loved a Fremen warrior and lost him in battle.

821
01:48:31,312 --> 01:48:34,816
我知道你生活在两个世界 有很多名字 
I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names.

822
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:41,989
我看到了你的梦 
I've seen your dream.

823
01:48:46,305 --> 01:48:47,786
作为皇帝 凯恩斯博士 
As Emperor, Dr. Kynes,

824
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:51,056
我只要挥挥手就能把阿拉基斯变成天堂 
I could make a paradise for Arrakis with the wave of my hand.

825
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,462
你真觉得他会是救世主吗?
Do you really think he could be the Mahdi?

826
01:48:57,672 --> 01:48:59,423
他看起来很年轻 
He looks very young.

827
01:50:46,948 --> 01:50:49,158
萨尔多卡！
Sardaukar!

828
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:54,914
-不!邓肯! -保罗,不!
-No! Duncan! -Paul, no!

829
01:50:58,834 --> 01:51:02,421
-邓肯 不！ -他锁门了 
-Duncan, no! -He's locked the door.

830
01:51:51,804 --> 01:51:52,852
他走了 
He's gone.

831
01:51:53,504 --> 01:51:54,462
邓肯!
Duncan!

832
01:51:54,566 --> 01:51:56,254
我们得走了 我们别无选择 
We have to go. We have no choice.

833
01:52:03,941 --> 01:52:06,152
保罗,快跑!
Paul, run!

834
01:52:25,254 --> 01:52:27,089
快点 快点!
Come on, come on!

835
01:52:58,829 --> 01:53:01,900
跟着光线走 你会发现一架扑翼机准备起飞 
Follow the light. You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

836
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:04,208
外面的风暴是你最好的机会 
That storm out there is your best shot.

837
01:53:04,335 --> 01:53:09,048
在5000米以上 大部分都是灰尘 爬进去 留在上面 
Above 5000 meters, it's mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top.

838
01:53:09,247 --> 01:53:12,279
-往南走 找到弗里曼 -你不跟我们一起去?
-Head south. Find the Fremen. -You're not coming with us?

839
01:53:12,367 --> 01:53:13,602
只有两个座位 
It only sits two.

840
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:17,301
我去下一站把这次袭击报告给兰德斯拉德 
I'll go to the next station and report this attack to the Landsraad.

841
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:19,225
如何?
How?

842
01:53:19,392 --> 01:53:22,430
我是弗里曼人 沙漠是我的家 
I'm Fremen. The desert is my home.

843
01:53:24,063 --> 01:53:26,690
好运 -好运 
-Good luck. -Good luck.

844
01:56:03,264 --> 01:56:07,017
凯恩斯 你背叛了皇帝 
Kynes, you have betrayed the emperor.

845
01:56:07,184 --> 01:56:09,124
我只侍奉一个主人 
I serve only one master.

846
01:56:09,873 --> 01:56:12,794
他叫沙胡鲁德 
His name is Shai-Hulud.

847
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,510
我们后面有喷气式飞机 
There are jet flyers behind us.

848
01:57:33,562 --> 01:57:35,230
保罗 我们还不够高!
Paul, we are not high enough!

849
01:58:08,097 --> 01:58:11,350
我不能害怕 恐惧是心灵杀手 
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.

850
01:58:11,517 --> 01:58:14,978
恐惧是小死亡带来的完全毁灭 
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

851
01:58:20,693 --> 01:58:23,696
看见朋友 
See the friend.

852
01:58:33,163 --> 01:58:36,667
生命的奥秘不是一个需要解决的问题 
The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve.

853
01:58:38,419 --> 01:58:41,171
而是要经历的现实 
But a reality to experience.

854
01:58:44,717 --> 01:58:49,221
一个无法通过停止它来理解的进程 
A process that cannot be understand by stopping it.

855
01:58:49,388 --> 01:58:52,725
我们必须随着进程的进展而前进 
We must move with the flow of the process.

856
01:58:52,891 --> 01:58:56,562
我们必须加入它 我们必须随波逐流 
We must join it. We must float with it.

857
01:58:57,187 --> 01:59:00,774
让它去吧 让它去吧 
Let it go. Let it go.

858
01:59:33,974 --> 01:59:36,425
他还没有完全痊愈 
He hasn't fully healed yet.

859
01:59:47,821 --> 01:59:51,867
我们把他们追进了科里奥利风暴 
We chased them into a Coriolis storm.

860
01:59:53,327 --> 01:59:56,205
风速为每小时800公里 
Wind's at 800 kilometers an hour.

861
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:02,836
没有东西能在这样的风暴中幸存 
Nothing survives such a storm.

862
02:00:03,003 --> 02:00:07,424
他们死了 这是一个必然 
They're dead. It's a certainty.

863
02:00:14,765 --> 02:00:18,435
终于完成了 
So it's done finally.

864
02:00:18,923 --> 02:00:24,441
传话给吉迪擎天王让他开始出售我们的香料储备 
Send word to Giedi Prime to begin selling our spice reserves.

865
02:00:24,608 --> 02:00:28,570
但进展缓慢 我们不希望价格下降 
But slowly. We don't want the price to fall.

866
02:00:29,655 --> 02:00:33,700
你不知道我花了多少钱才把这么强大的力量带到屏障上 
You have no idea how much it cost me to bring such a force to barrier.

867
02:00:33,867 --> 02:00:37,663
现在我只有一个要求 收入 
Now I only have one requirement. Income.

868
02:00:38,664 --> 02:00:42,543
所以 挤压 拉班 用力挤压 
So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard.

869
02:00:42,709 --> 02:00:43,935
是 叔叔 
Yes, uncle.

870
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:46,666
弗里曼人呢?
And the Fremen?

871
02:00:47,923 --> 02:00:50,175
杀光他们 
Kill them all.

872
02:01:12,823 --> 02:01:14,366
我们在5000米以上 
We're above 5000 meters.

873
02:02:52,422 --> 02:02:56,093
我们一着陆 就跑向岩石 
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

874
02:04:47,245 --> 02:04:49,873
你用这个呼吸 
You breathe with this.

875
02:05:19,486 --> 02:05:21,468
现在我们得找到弗里曼人 
Now we have to find the Fremen.

876
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,992
你还好吗? -是的 
-Are you good? -Yeah.

877
02:06:32,893 --> 02:06:34,561
保罗……
Paul…

878
02:06:41,193 --> 02:06:44,070
别害怕 
Don't be frightened.

879
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:49,075
即使是一只小沙漠鼠也能存活 
Even a little desert mouse can survive.

880
02:06:52,746 --> 02:06:55,874
你需要面对你的恐惧 
You'll need to face your fears.

881
02:06:56,041 --> 02:07:00,503
朋友会帮助你 
A friend will help you.

882
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:04,007
跟随朋友 
Follow the friend.

883
02:07:05,759 --> 02:07:07,919
你还有很多要学 
You have much to learn.

884
02:07:08,887 --> 02:07:12,390
我也必指示你旷野的路 
And I will show you the ways of the desert.

885
02:07:14,893 --> 02:07:16,353
跟我来 
Come with me.

886
02:07:44,214 --> 02:07:47,717
西斯 邓肯住的地方 
The sietch, where Duncan lived.

887
02:07:47,884 --> 02:07:49,970
那边的某个地方 
Somewhere off that way.

888
02:07:52,624 --> 02:07:54,837
我能看见那边的绿色 
I can see the green over there.

889
02:07:55,438 --> 02:07:56,309
那儿 
There.

890
02:07:56,559 --> 02:07:58,349
这意味着弗里曼人住在那里 
That means Fremen live there.

891
02:08:03,024 --> 02:08:07,946
我们天黑后过河 弗里曼人就是这么做的 
We'll cross after dark. That's how the Fremen do it.

892
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:12,243
我们就要进入蠕虫的领地了 
We're about to enter worm territory.

893
02:08:13,075 --> 02:08:15,866
我们不能像普通人一样走路 如果那样……我们就死定了 
We can't walk like regular humans, if we do - we're dead.

894
02:08:15,996 --> 02:08:19,582
我们得像弗莱曼人一样走路 这叫沙漠漫步 
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do. It's called the sand walk.

895
02:08:19,749 --> 02:08:21,900
至少根据国内的电影书籍 
At least according to the film books back home.

896
02:08:22,891 --> 02:08:24,079
是的 是的 我知道了 
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it.

897
02:08:24,212 --> 02:08:27,632
好吧 跟着我 做同样的动作 
Okay, follow me. Do the same moves.

898
02:08:40,666 --> 02:08:42,283
我认为这是正确的方向 
I think this is the right direction.

899
02:10:04,604 --> 02:10:08,817
就在附近 我们从这里出去吧 
It's close by. Let's get out of here.

900
02:10:10,819 --> 02:10:12,153
等等 
Wait.

901
02:10:13,696 --> 02:10:15,448
是鼓沙 
It's drum sand.

902
02:10:19,661 --> 02:10:20,829
快跑!
Run!

903
02:10:26,751 --> 02:10:28,753
走!走!
Go! Go!

904
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:41,743
是一个巨人 
It's a thumper.

905
02:11:47,373 --> 02:11:50,126
有人引爆了炸弹 
Someone set off a thumper.

906
02:12:03,765 --> 02:12:05,934
保罗,快跑!
Paul, run!

907
02:12:20,657 --> 02:12:24,661
它们有多大？这太疯狂了 
How big are they? That was insane.

908
02:12:27,997 --> 02:12:30,583
有人召唤他 
Someone called him.

909
02:12:38,675 --> 02:12:41,761
我们并不孤单 
We are not alone.

910
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:03,248
别跑 
Do not run.

911
02:13:04,619 --> 02:13:07,801
你只会浪费身体的水分 
You will only waste your bodies water.

912
02:13:08,371 --> 02:13:10,623
拿着 
Hold.

913
02:13:16,796 --> 02:13:18,506
斯蒂尔加 
Stilgar.

914
02:13:18,673 --> 02:13:23,219
嘿 你了解我的 你去我父亲的御前会议时我也在场 
Hey, you know me. I was there when you came to my father's council.

915
02:13:23,386 --> 02:13:25,471
这是公爵的儿子 
This is the Duke's son.

916
02:13:25,638 --> 02:13:29,225
还等什么？我们需要他们的水 
Why are you waiting? We need their water.

917
02:13:29,392 --> 02:13:32,854
这就是我跟你说过的那个男孩 我们不能碰他 
This is the boy I told you about. We can't touch him.

918
02:13:33,021 --> 02:13:37,150
-他是利桑·盖布？-他还没有证明自己 
-Is he Lisan al-Gaib? -He hasn't proved himself.

919
02:13:37,317 --> 02:13:40,862
他们是弱者 -杰米斯……
-They're weaklings. -Jamis…

920
02:13:41,029 --> 02:13:45,325
他们在沙胡鲁德的路上勇敢地穿越了一次 
There was a brave crossing they made in the path of Shai-Hulud.

921
02:13:45,491 --> 02:13:48,378
他说话和行动都不像个懦夫 
He does not speak or act like a weakling.

922
02:13:49,655 --> 02:13:51,475
他的父亲也不像 
Nor did his father.

923
02:13:51,563 --> 02:13:54,083
我的重击器救了他的命 
My thumper saved his life.

924
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:58,671
冷静点 斯蒂加 他不是命中注定的那个人 
Go back to reason, Stilgar. He's not The One.

925
02:14:01,132 --> 02:14:02,925
我们有强大的朋友 
We have powerful friends.

926
02:14:03,092 --> 02:14:07,430
你帮我们离开这个世界 去卡拉丹 你会得到丰厚的回报 
You help us off world, to Caladan, you will be well rewarded.

927
02:14:07,597 --> 02:14:12,727
在你肉体之外 你能提供什么财富呢?
What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh.

928
02:14:16,939 --> 02:14:20,129
这个男孩很年轻 他可以学习我们的方法 
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

929
02:14:20,916 --> 02:14:22,712
他可能有避难所 
He may have sanctuary.

930
02:14:23,738 --> 02:14:25,745
但是这个女人没有受过训练
But the woman isn't trained

931
02:14:28,658 --> 02:14:29,938
也太老了 学不了 
and too old to learn.

932
02:15:02,402 --> 02:15:03,796
回来 你们这些狗！
Back, you dogs!

933
02:15:05,212 --> 02:15:06,597
她会割断我的喉咙 
She'll cut my throat.

934
02:15:12,245 --> 02:15:16,374
你为什么不说你是个古怪的女人 还是个斗士?
Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?

935
02:15:16,541 --> 02:15:18,835
谈话很简短 
The conversation ran short.

936
02:15:19,001 --> 02:15:22,216
和平 女人 和平 
Peace, woman, peace.

937
02:15:23,442 --> 02:15:24,658
我判断错了 
I misjudged.

938
02:15:33,182 --> 02:15:38,271
太阳升起来了 我们必须到达塔布西斯 
The sun is rising. We must reach Sietch Tabr.

939
02:15:39,689 --> 02:15:42,358
陌生人的命运将在那里决定 
The fate of the strangers will be decided there.

940
02:15:47,572 --> 02:15:52,285
在那之前 他们由我保护 
Until then, they are under my protection.

941
02:15:53,953 --> 02:15:56,581
我向你保证 
I give you my word.

942
02:16:04,304 --> 02:16:06,381
我不会让你伤害我的朋友 
I would not have let you hurt my friends.

943
02:16:31,783 --> 02:16:33,441
他们说你是救世主 
They say you are the Mahdi.

944
02:16:34,191 --> 02:16:36,070
但你看起来像个小男孩 
But you look like a little boy.

945
02:16:37,789 --> 02:16:41,292
你选了一条最艰难的路 跟我来 
You chose the hardest way up. Follow me.

946
02:16:43,002 --> 02:16:45,880
起飞!起飞!
Take off! Take off!

947
02:16:48,007 --> 02:16:49,273
把它给我 
Give it to me.

948
02:16:56,724 --> 02:16:59,916
你应该有自己的毛拉手枪 当你赢得它的时候 
You would have your own maula pistol when you've earned it.

949
02:17:00,071 --> 02:17:01,334
把它给我 
Give it to me.

950
02:17:06,859 --> 02:17:11,050
查妮 负责新来的人 确保他们在旅途中安全 
Chani, take charge of the newcomers. See that they are safe in the journey.

951
02:17:11,254 --> 02:17:12,209
我们走吧 
Let's go.

952
02:17:12,532 --> 02:17:15,117
我不要他们 
I will not have them.

953
02:17:20,456 --> 02:17:24,335
杰米斯 我说过了 安静些 
Jamis, I have spoken. Be still.

954
02:17:24,502 --> 02:17:28,756
你说话像个领袖 而且是最强的领袖 
You talk like a leader, but the strongest leads.

955
02:17:30,174 --> 02:17:32,760
她打败了你 
She bested you.

956
02:17:32,927 --> 02:17:35,763
我祈求阿姆塔尔 
I invoke the Amtal.

957
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:39,433
-你不能挑战萨亚迪娜 -那谁会以她的名义战斗?
-You may not challenge a sayyadina. -Then who will fight in her name?

958
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:44,814
杰米斯 别这样 别 夜色渐深 
Jamis, don't do this. Don't. The night is fading.

959
02:17:44,981 --> 02:17:47,755
太阳将见证这死亡
Then the sun will witness this death.

960
02:17:47,993 --> 02:17:49,733
她的冠军在哪里?
Where is her champion?

961
02:18:00,788 --> 02:18:03,708
我接受她的冠军 
I accept her champion.

962
02:18:34,599 --> 02:18:37,547
保罗·厄崔迪必须为……
Paul Atreides must die…

963
02:18:40,745 --> 02:18:45,207
奎萨兹·哈德拉赫的崛起而死 
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

964
02:18:48,085 --> 02:18:53,283
别害怕 别抗拒 
Don't be frightened. Don't resist.

965
02:18:59,513 --> 02:19:04,399
当你夺走别人的生命时 你也夺走了自己的生命 
When you take a life, you take your own.

966
02:19:36,092 --> 02:19:39,845
我不相信你是利桑·盖布 
I don't believe you are the Lisan al-Gaib.

967
02:19:40,012 --> 02:19:42,682
但我希望你死得光荣 
But I want you to die with honor.

968
02:19:53,609 --> 02:19:57,113
这把水晶刀是我姑婆送给我的 
This crysknife was given to me by my great-aunt.

969
02:19:59,657 --> 02:20:04,078
它是由一种巨大的沙虫沙胡鲁德的牙齿制成的 
It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud, the great sand worm.

970
02:20:05,037 --> 02:20:07,999
如果你拿着它死去 那将是莫大的荣耀 
This would be a great honor if you to die holding it.

971
02:20:12,211 --> 02:20:14,714
外部世界在哪里?
Where is the outworlder?

972
02:20:19,176 --> 02:20:24,265
杰米斯是个好战士 他不会让你受苦的 
Jamis is a good fighter. He won't let you suffer.

973
02:20:25,141 --> 02:20:26,684
查尼……
Chani…

974
02:20:39,030 --> 02:20:40,114
不要紧 
Never mind.

975
02:21:35,753 --> 02:21:39,131
愿你的刀碎成碎片 
May your knife chip and shatter.

976
02:21:45,679 --> 02:21:47,519
你应该欢迎我的刀锋 
You should welcome my blade.

977
02:21:51,143 --> 02:21:53,354
这个世界会杀了你 
This world will kill you.

978
02:21:56,232 --> 02:21:57,566
这样更快 
Quicker this way.

979
02:22:37,481 --> 02:22:39,034
你屈服吗?
Do you yield?

980
02:22:41,443 --> 02:22:43,696
这孩子不知道我们的规则 
The boy does not know our rule.

981
02:22:43,853 --> 02:22:47,802
在阿姆塔尔规则下没有屈服 只有死亡是对此的考验 
There is no yielding under the Amtal rule, only death is the test of that.

982
02:22:56,333 --> 02:22:58,102
他在戏弄他吗? -不 
-Is he toying with him? -No.

983
02:22:59,587 --> 02:23:01,089
保罗从未杀过人 
Paul has never killed a man.

984
02:23:12,308 --> 02:23:16,061
克维萨茨·哈德拉赫 
Kwisatz Haderach.

985
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:22,443
克维萨茨·哈德拉赫 
Kwisatz Haderach.

986
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:26,322
爬上 上升 
Climb up. Rise.

987
02:25:19,101 --> 02:25:22,813
你现在是我们的一员了 一命换一命 
You're one of us now. A life for a life.

988
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:25,899
-跟我们去塔布西斯吧 -不 
-Come with us to Sietch Tabr. -No.

989
02:25:26,066 --> 02:25:27,609
保罗需要离开这个世界 
Paul needs to get off world.

990
02:25:27,714 --> 02:25:30,724
你一定有办法 你有走私者 你有船只 
You must have ways. You have smugglers, you have ships.

991
02:25:30,877 --> 02:25:32,294
-不 -你有……
-No. -You have--

992
02:25:33,422 --> 02:25:35,326
是皇帝派我们来的 
The Emperor sent us to this place.

993
02:25:36,869 --> 02:25:38,523
我父亲来……
And my father came…

994
02:25:39,621 --> 02:25:44,209
不是为了香料 不是为了财富 
Not for spice, not for the riches,

995
02:25:44,376 --> 02:25:45,896
而是因为你的人民的力量 
but for the strength of your people.

996
02:25:49,506 --> 02:25:51,455
我的路通向沙漠 
My road leads into the desert.

997
02:25:54,178 --> 02:25:56,472
我能看到 
I could see it.

998
02:25:58,098 --> 02:26:02,013
如果你愿意 我们会来的 
If you'll have us, we will come.

999
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:52,265
沙漠力量 
Desert power.

1000
02:26:53,737 --> 02:26:55,305
这仅仅是个开始 
This is only the beginning.

1001
02:27:14,011 --> 02:27:25,132
