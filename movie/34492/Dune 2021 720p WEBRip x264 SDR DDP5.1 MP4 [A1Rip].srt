00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,600
<i>My planet, Arrakis, is so beautiful
when the sun is low.</i>

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
<i>Rolling over the sands…</i>

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>You can see spice in the air.</i>

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,120
<i>At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.</i>

8
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,120
<i>The outsiders race against time
to avoid the heat of the day.</i>

9
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,520
<i>They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.</i>

10
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.</i>

11
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,040
<i>These outsiders, The Harkonnens,
came long before I was born.</i>

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,680
<i>By controlling the spice production
they became obscenely rich.</i>

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,400
<i>Richer than the Emperor himself.</i>

14
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,880
<i>Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis
from the Harkonnens,

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,080
<i>but one day, by imperial decree,
they were gone.</i>

16
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,720
<i>Why did the Emperor choose this path?
And who our next oppressors be?</i>

CALADAN
HOMEWORLD OF HOUSE ATREIDES

19
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,480
It's good you're up early.

20
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,960
Father wants you in full dress
before the Emperor's herald arrives.

21
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,640
Full dress? Military?

22
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
Ceremonial.

23
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,720
Why do we have to go through all of this
when it's already been decided?

24
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Ceremony.

25
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
Thank you.

26
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,840
If you want it make me give it to you.

27
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,520
-Use the Voice.
-Mom, I just woke up.

28
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
-Give me the water.
-The glass can't hear you. Command me.

29
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,560
Give me the water.

30
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,160
-Almost.
-Almost?

31
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,720
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

32
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,200
You look tired. More dreams?

33
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,280
No.

34
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,240
<i>Extreme temperatures
and treacherous weather events</i>

35
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,840
<i>make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile.</i>

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,480
<i>With sandstorms powerful enough
to cut through the metal.</i>

37
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,080
<i>Only the native tribes known as the Fremen
have adapted well enough to survive.</i>

38
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,960
<i>Preferring to inhabit
the remotest regions of Arrakis</i>

39
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,480
<i>the Fremen share the deep desert
with the giant sandworms</i>

40
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,520
<i>known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud.</i>

41
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>Long exposure to spice has given
the tribe their characteristic blue eyes,</i>

42
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
<i>the eyes of Ibad.</i>

43
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,720
<i>Little else is known of the Fremen,</i>

44
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,800
<i>except that they are dangerous
and unreliable.</i>

45
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,640
<i>Fremen attacks make spice harvesting
extremely hazardous.</i>

46
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,120
<i>For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen</i>

47
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,800
<i>which preserves life and brings
enormous health benefits.</i>

48
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,760
<i>For the Imperium, the spice is used
by the navigators of the Spacing Guild</i>

49
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,520
<i>to find safe paths between the stars.</i>

50
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,680
<i>Without spice
interstellar travel is impossible,</i>

51
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,000
<i>making it by far the most valuable
substance in the universe.</i>

52
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Smile, Gurney.

53
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,280
I am smiling.

54
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,600
How much will it cost them traveling
all this way for this formality?

55
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:41,080
Three Guild navigators and a total
of 1,460,062 solaris for the round trip.

56
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,760
By the grace of Shaddam IV
of the House Corrino,

57
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne
of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe,

58
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,600
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

59
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

60
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,680
representatives of the Spacing Guild,
and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

61
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,520
The Emperor has spoken:

62
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,410
"House Atreides shall immediately
take control of Arrakis

63
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
and serve as its steward."

64
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,520
Do you accept?

65
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,880
We are the House Atreides.

66
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,520
There is no call we do not answer.
There is no faith that we betray.

67
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,320
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

68
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
House Atreides accepts.

69
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,360
Atreides!

70
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,600
Your seal.

71
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,600
So, it's done?

72
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,120
It's done.

73
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,240
-How was it?
-The stabilizers are too loose.

74
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,720
-I'll handle that.
-Thank you, my friend.

75
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
-Duncan.
-My boy!

76
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Paul, my boy.

77
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,520
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow
with the advance team?

78
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow
with the advance team.

79
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,560
-I'd like you to take me with you.
-You would?

80
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,200
That's too bad, cause no.

81
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,840
Duncan…

82
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,200
Are you trying to give me court-martial?
What's going on?

83
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,960
-Can I trust you with something?
-Always. You know that.

84
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
I've been having dreams.

85
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,680
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

86
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay, so?

87
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
I saw you.

88
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
With the Fremen.

89
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,800
So I do find them? There you go.
That's a good omen right there, right?

90
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Lanville!

91
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,840
I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle.

92
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
I felt like if I had been there
you'd be alive.

93
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:55,271
First of, I'm not gonna die.

94
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,477
-You're not taking me seriously.
-That's why you wanna come with me?

95
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,559
Listen, dreams make good stories,

96
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,309
but everything important
happens when we're awake,

97
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,328
because that's where
we make things happen.

98
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
-Look at you, put up some muscle?
-I did?

99
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
No.

100
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,640
See you in Arrakis, my boy.

101
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,730
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

102
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,720
on a scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow.

103
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,445
I've studied the Fremen language.
I'd be an asset.

104
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,649
Out of the question.

105
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,141
You'll travel in a few weeks
to Arrakis like the rest of us.

106
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:04,076
I've been training my whole life…
What is the point if I'm not allowed--

107
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,640
You know why, Paul.
You're the future of the House Atreides.

108
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,840
And grandfather fought bulls for sport.

109
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Yes, look where that got him.

110
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,560
I need you by my side. When we get
to Arrakis we'll face enormous danger.

111
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,120
What danger? The Fremen? The desert?

112
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,320
Political danger.

113
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,040
The great houses look to us for leadership
and this threatens the Emperor.

114
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,360
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens
and making it ours

115
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,720
he sets the stage for a war
which would weaken both houses.

116
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,760
But if we hold firm
and tap the true power of Arrakis

117
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,080
we could be stronger than ever.

118
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,338
What does that mean?

119
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:55,234
Mining spice, keeping
the Fremen in their place?

120
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,683
We'd be no better than Harkonnens.

121
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,520
No. By making an alliance with the Fremen.

122
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,960
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

123
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,800
Here, on Caladan, we've ruled
by air power and sea power.

124
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,600
On Arrakis, we need to cultivate
desert power.

125
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I want you sitting in
on my council, learn what I do.

126
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,160
What if I'm not, dad?

127
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Not what?

128
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,160
The future of the House Atreides.

129
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,600
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

130
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,440
-I wanted to be a pilot.
-You never told me that.

131
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,680
Your grandfather said, "A great
man doesn't seek to lead.

132
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,280
He's called to it. And he answers."

133
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
And if your answer is "no"

134
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,840
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be,

135
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,280
my son.

136
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,440
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

137
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,040
In their memory…

138
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
give it a try.

139
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
Don't stand with your back to the door.

140
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,200
How many times do we have to tell you?

141
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,619
I could tell it was you
by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

142
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,638
Someone might imitate my stride.

143
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,193
I know the difference.
Are you the new weapons master?

144
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:01,397
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best as I can.

145
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:03,624
Choose your blade.

146
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,000
I've had quite a day, Gurney.
Give us a song instead.

147
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,440
That's rude.

148
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
Come on. Come on.

149
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,840
Old man.

150
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,400
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

151
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,320
-I'm guessing I'm not in the mood today.
-Mood? What's mood got to do with it?

152
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,880
You fight when the necessity arises,
no matter the mood. Now, fight!

153
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
Come on!

154
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,800
-I have you.
-Aye.

155
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,480
But look down, my lord.
You'd have joined me in death.

156
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
I see you found the mood.

157
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,440
-Will it be that bad?
-You don't get it, do you?

158
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,960
You don't really understand the grave
nature of what's happening to us.

159
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,480
For 80 years Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

160
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,760
Eighty years of owning the spice fields.
Can you imagine the wealth?

161
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,463
In your eyes, I need
to see it in your eyes.

162
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:04,495
You never met Harkonners before. I have.

163
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,966
They are not human. They're brutal!

164
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
You have to be ready.

165
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,880
GIEDI PRIME
HOMEWORLD OF HOUSE HARKONNEN

166
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,400
Lord Baron.

167
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
Rabban.

168
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,320
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis. It's done.

169
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Very good.

170
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:06,131
Uncle, how did we let this happen?

171
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:10,809
How can the Emperor
take everything we've built

172
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:14,088
and give it to that Duke? How?

173
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,120
Don't be too sure, it's an act of love.

174
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,360
What does he mean?

175
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,760
When is a gift not a gift?

176
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,440
The Atreides Voice is rising

177
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,040
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

178
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,400
A dangerous, jealous man.

179
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,840
Paul…

180
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
Paul, wake up.

181
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,920
-What's wrong?
-Get dressed and come with me.

182
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
What is this?

183
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,530
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

184
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:30,297
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

185
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:33,020
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

186
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,627
She would like to meet you.

187
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,001
Why?

188
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:40,436
She wants to know about your dreams.

189
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
How does she know about my dreams?

190
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,960
-And why is Dr. Yueh here?
-He only needs a moment.

191
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,924
Hello, young master.

192
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:54,247
Your mother asked me to check your vitals.

193
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
What's happening?

194
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,440
Bene Gesserit claims
to serve the greater good.

195
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,880
But with all due respect to your mother,

196
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,120
they also serve their own agenda.

197
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
What are you saying?

198
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,800
Be careful.

199
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,600
His heart is strong as ever, my lady.

200
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Not a word of this to anyone.

201
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,440
Paul…

202
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,120
Remember your training.

203
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,720
Who are you?

204
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,743
Defiance in the eyes, like his father.

205
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,793
Leave us.

206
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,840
You must do everything
the Mother Helen Mohiam tells you.

207
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,960
You dismiss my mother in her own house.

208
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,360
Come here. Kneel.

209
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
How dare you use the Voice on me?

210
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,080
Put your right hand in the box.

211
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,000
Your mother bade you obey me.

212
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,920
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar,
a poison needle, instant death.

213
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,340
The test is simple.

214
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,958
Remove your hand
from the box, and you die.

215
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,520
What's in the box?

216
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
Pain.

217
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,160
No need to call the guards.

218
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,520
Your mother stands behind that door.
No one will get past her.

219
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
Why are you doing this?

220
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,160
An animal caught in a trap
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

221
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,120
What will you do?

222
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Silence.

223
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,640
I must not fear.

224
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:24,241
I must not fear.

225
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,200
Fear is the mind-killer.

226
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,720
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

227
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:44,057
I will face my fear and I will permit it
to pass over me and through me.

228
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,360
And when it has gone past…

229
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

230
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,800
Where the fear has gone
there will be nothing.

231
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,400
Only I will remain.

232
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:29,160
Enough.

233
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,840
Like sifting sand through a screen,
we sift people.

234
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,578
If you had been unable to control
your impulses like an animal,

235
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:56,432
we could not have let you live.

236
00:26:57,392 --> 00:26:59,760
You inherit too much power.

237
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,720
-What, because I'm a Duke's son?
-Because you are Jessica's son.

238
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,560
You have more than one birthright, boy.

239
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Jessica.

240
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,760
You've been training him in a Way.

241
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,960
-Tell me about these dreams.
-I had one tonight.

242
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,080
What did you see?

243
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,920
-A girl on Arrakis.
-Have you dreamt of her before?

244
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,120
Many times.

245
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,880
Do you often dream things that happen
just as you dreamt them?

246
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,040
Not exactly.

247
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Goodbye, young human.
I hope you'll live.

248
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,560
Did you have to go that far?

249
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,120
You chose to train him in the Way
in defiance of the rule.

250
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,640
He wields our power.
He had to be tested to the limits.

251
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,010
So much potential wasted in the male.

252
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:19,598
You were told to bear only daughters,

253
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:22,980
but you and your pride thought
you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

254
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,271
Was I wrong?

255
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,575
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

256
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:29,483
If he is The One he has a long way to go.

257
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:33,560
His sight is barely awakened
and now he goes into the fire.

258
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,963
But our plans are measured
in centuries.

259
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,978
We have other prospects

260
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,519
if he fails his promise.

261
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,760
Do you see so little hope?

262
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,880
On Arrakis, we have done
all we can for you.

263
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,760
The path has been laid.
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

264
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,440
Paul…

265
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,080
What does it mean?

266
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,080
-That I can be The One?
-You heard?

267
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,232
The Bene Gesserit serve
as powerful partners to the great houses,

268
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:54,186
but there's more to it.

269
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,160
You stir the politics
on the Imperium from the shadows.

270
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,240
-I know.
-You don't know everything.

271
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:04,411
For thousands of years,

272
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:08,305
we've been carefully
crossing bloodlines to bring forth--

273
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,000
The One?

274
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
A mind…

275
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:20,080
powerful enough to breach
space and time, past and future…

276
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,600
who can help us into a better future.

277
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
We think he's very close now.

278
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,920
Some believe he is here.

279
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,160
All part of the plan.

280
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
Shields.

281
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,680
"My lungs taste the air of Time,
Blown past falling sands."

282
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,480
Thufir Hawat.

283
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,560
Young master, how does it feel
to walk on the new world?

284
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,120
Exciting, to say the least.

285
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,960
-My Lord.
-How are you, old friend?

286
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,259
My advance team has secured the city.

287
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,116
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

288
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,600
My Lady.

289
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
Lisan al-Gaib!

290
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Lisan al-Gaib!

291
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:23,523
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

292
00:35:23,607 --> 00:35:26,472
They follow their old master's rules,
mandatory attendancy.

293
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:28,920
That's Harkonnen love out there.

294
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,680
Atreides!

295
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:50,100
Let's get you out of the sun.

296
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:52,719
The heat can kill in this place.

297
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,425
They were pointing at us.

298
00:36:11,263 --> 00:36:12,235
What were they shouting?

299
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:16,516
Lisan al-Gaib.
"The Voice from the Outer World."

300
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,049
It's their name for "messiah."

301
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,828
That means that Bene Gesserit
have done a work here.

302
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,484
Planting superstitions?

303
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,839
Preparing the way, Paul.

304
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,160
These people have waited
for centuries for the Lisan al-Gaib.

305
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,120
They see you, they see the signs.

306
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,760
They see what they've been told to see.

307
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,600
We're good to go.

308
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,920
Shield wall, protects the city
from the weather and the worms.

309
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,680
The locals call the big one
the "Hand of God."

310
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,360
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc on our com system.

311
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,920
It's so quiet.

312
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,680
Yeah. That's what worries me too.

313
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,801
There's a space port,

314
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:46,597
and in that plump of dust
there's a spice refinery.

315
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,000
Our two most vulnerable points.
I want you guarding them.

316
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,040
If we can't refine spice and ship it
off to the world, we're dead here.

317
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,520
The sun is getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

318
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,160
What do they say
about this hell hole again?

319
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,173
"It's a shower, you scrub
your ass with sand,"

320
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:07,740
My Lord, that's what they say.

321
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,920
That's what they say.

322
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,240
Candidates for a house keeper, my lady.

323
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,728
-What is your name?
-Shadout Mapes, my lady.

324
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,920
The rest of you may go. Thank you.

325
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,680
Shadout.

326
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,560
It's an old chakobsa word.

327
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,227
"Well dipper."

328
00:39:49,278 --> 00:39:50,250
You are Fremen.

329
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
-You know the ancient tongues?
-I know many things.

330
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,800
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodies.

331
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
Wait.

332
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,640
If you mean to harm me,
I must warn you whatever you're hiding,

333
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,280
it won't be enough.

334
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,000
My weapon is meant as a gift

335
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,840
if you are truly The One.

336
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,840
Do you know this?

337
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,760
It's a crysknife.

338
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
Do you know its meaning?

339
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
Be ready.

340
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,240
It's a maker.

341
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,280
A maker of the deep desert.

342
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,675
When you have lived
with a prophecy for so long

343
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:56,650
the moment of revelation is a shock.

344
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,760
Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son.

345
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,200
It is yours.

346
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,960
Tooth of Shai-Hulud.

347
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,800
Hello.

348
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,240
You shouldn't be out here
at this time of the day.

349
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,400
They are out here.

350
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,280
Fremen pilgrims.
They don't care about heat stroke.

351
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,240
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

352
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,160
These aren't indigenous.
They can't survive without me.

353
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,360
Each one of these drinks every day
the equivalent of five man.

354
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,680
Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives.

355
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,080
-Should we remove them? Save the water?
-No, no.

356
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,400
These are sacred.

357
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Old dream.

358
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,080
<i>The largest and the most dangerous
organism on Arrakis is the sandworm.</i>

359
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,000
<i>Capable of reaching 400 meters in length.</i>

360
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,080
<i>To avoid making rhythmic noises
which attract the sandworms,</i>

361
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,960
<i>the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sand walk,</i>

362
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,836
<i>a dance-like motion with irregular rhythm</i>

363
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:15,709
<i>which emulates the natural sounds
of the desert.</i>

364
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,080
<i>What scant plant life exists
on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen,</i>

365
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,031
<i>who have cultivated
deep-rooted terrain plants,</i>

366
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:27,080
<i>such as saguaro, burrobush,</i>

367
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,920
<i>sand verbena and incense bush.</i>

368
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,160
<i>The shepherd's tree
has the deepest documented roots,</i>

369
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,280
<i>stretching more than 450 feet deep.</i>

370
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,800
<i>These plants cling to life
in a parched nutrient-poor landscape.</i>

371
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,640
It's a hunter-seeker.
The operator must be nearby.

372
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,840
The Harkonnen agent was cemented
into that hole six weeks ago.

373
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,480
Manned the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe inside the walls.

374
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,154
Sir, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

375
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:10,796
You have my resignation.

376
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,800
-You'd deprive us of your talents?
-Sir, my honor demands--

377
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,600
They tried to take the life of my son!

378
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,371
I don't give a damn about your honor.
You want absolution? Go catch some spies.

379
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:21,798
Your Grace.

380
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,000
The thing must leave.

381
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,800
You can speak without fear.
Our pet doesn't understand your language.

382
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,720
Get out!

383
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,640
It understands. Activate silence.

384
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,960
What is the Emperor's message?

385
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,000
He will strengthen your hand.

386
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,033
With his Sardaukar army…

387
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,120
It must never be known.

388
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,000
There's no satellites over Arrakis.
The Atreides would die in the dark.

389
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,789
On that matter.

390
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:13,036
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

391
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,040
But his wife is under our protection,
and by extension, her son.

392
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,880
Allow them the dignity of exile.

393
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,520
House Harkonnen would never dream
of violating the sanctity of your order.

394
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,720
I give you my word.
We would not harm them.

395
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,840
-If the Duke's son lives--
-No Atreides will live.

396
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,800
My Lord, you gave your word to the witch.
And she sees too much.

397
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,800
I said I would not harm them.
And I shall not.

398
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,320
But Arrakis is Arrakis,

399
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,400
and the desert takes the weak.

400
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,760
My desert.

401
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,560
My Arrakis.

402
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,120
My dune.

403
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,112
Your first strategy meeting.

404
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:31,440
Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands like a hero of all.

405
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,400
-Thanks for the humiliation, old man.
-I'll keep an eye on you.

406
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,480
Attention!

407
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,440
Let's get started.

408
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,960
Thufir, operations.

409
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,280
I've secured a copy
of the Harkonnen's account books.

410
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,400
The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion
solaris out of here every year.

411
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,729
"They shall suck at the abundance
of the seas

412
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,510
and on the treasures hidden in the sand."

413
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,839
We won't see profits
like that for a while,

414
00:48:06,994 --> 00:48:08,935
not with the equipment they left us.

415
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,400
How bad is it?

416
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,830
These are spice silos.

417
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:22,771
We are meant to fill every crate.

418
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,160
All of them?

419
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,123
Every 25 standard days.

420
00:48:28,148 --> 00:48:30,476
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

421
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,915
But who's meant to arbitrate?

422
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,473
Isn't there a Judge of the Change
to oversee the transition?

423
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,640
-Who did the Emperor appoint?
-Dr. Liet Kynes, imperial ecologist.

424
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,840
Been here 20 years.
Eccentric from what I'm told.

425
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,420
I want to see
these harvesting fields myself.

426
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,157
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

427
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,061
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

428
00:48:49,145 --> 00:48:50,656
Our meeting is long overdue.

429
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,762
And we'll get a bit
of imperial protection.

430
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:55,198
A hostage? I love it.

431
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,640
He's here, my lord

432
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,560
Take care of them, they are friends.

433
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,000
-Duncan!
-My boy!

434
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,880
-I swear you're getting taller.
-Well, you smell much worse.

435
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,990
For four weeks I've lived with the Fremen,

436
00:49:40,136 --> 00:49:42,491
hidden in the desert,
in the community called the sietch.

437
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,480
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch
has come with me to meet you, sir.

438
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,200
-This sietch, how was it hidden?
-It's under ground.

439
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,108
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

440
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,341
How big was the place?

441
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,680
It's a ten thousand people,
and there are hundreds of sietches.

442
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,960
Millions of Fremen. You were right.

443
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,800
The Harkonnen estimate
was fifty thousand on the whole planet.

444
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,280
The Fremen watched me search
for them for days. I never saw them.

445
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,871
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me,

446
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,745
and I have to tell you,
I've never come so close to dying.

447
00:50:15,475 --> 00:50:17,448
There's no finer fighter in the Imperium.

448
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,560
-They fight like demons.
-Desert power.

449
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,880
-Duncan, well done.
-Thank you, my lord.

450
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,800
Sir, their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sir.

451
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,638
It's a crysknife,
it's sacred to his people.

452
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:35,365
Let him pass.

453
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:51,609
Stop there.

454
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:53,919
Hey! Hey!

455
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,280
Stilgar, welcome.

456
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,440
Sir, I respect the personal dignity
of any man that respects mine.

457
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:16,768
Hold.

458
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,060
Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift
of your body's moisture.

459
00:51:22,964 --> 00:51:24,960
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

460
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,520
I'm glad you've come.

461
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,280
I believe your people and mine
have much to offer one another.

462
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,065
You are outworlders,
you come here for the spice,

463
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,462
You take it, giving nothing in return.

464
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,025
That's true.

465
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:50,675
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

466
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,129
Name what you want.

467
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:56,397
If it's in my power to grant
I'll give it and ask for nothing.

468
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,869
I ask for this: do not seek our sietches,
do not trespass in our lands.

469
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:05,148
The desert was ours long before you came.

470
00:52:05,232 --> 00:52:06,749
So, come and dig your spice,

471
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:10,346
but when you have it,
go back to this side of the shield wall

472
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,993
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

473
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,800
You will address the Duke
as "my lord," or "sir."

474
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,200
Gurney, just… Just a moment.

475
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,920
The Emperor has given me Arrakis
as my fief to rule and protect.

476
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,320
I cannot promise not to travel
into the desert if duty compels me.

477
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,520
But your sietches will be yours forever.

478
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,779
and you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

479
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,962
That's very honorable.

480
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,236
I must go.

481
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,632
That's all I have to say to you.

482
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,760
Why don't you stay.
We would honor you.

483
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,680
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

484
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,320
I know who you are.

485
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,720
-I don't like him.
-Our plan bears fruit.

486
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,115
But it will take time.

487
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:09,322
Yes. It will take time.

488
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,560
Here, this is for you.

489
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,440
It's a paracompass.

490
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,640
The moons here have a magnetic field, so
a simple compass needle won't point north.

491
00:53:24,683 --> 00:53:26,759
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

492
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,045
Do Fremen make these?

493
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,640
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,
and all kinds of ingenious things.

494
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,840
What the hell is a sand compactor?

495
00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:36,622
That's a sand compactor.

496
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:40,072
My God, man, you've gone native.

497
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,899
You admire them.

498
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,240
I do.

499
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,531
They're fierce but loyal.

500
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,215
They're tuned into the desert,
part of it, it's part of them.

501
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,520
You wait till you see it.

502
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,440
It's beautiful out there.

503
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,400
<i>Sunrise warning.</i>

504
00:54:01,564 --> 00:54:05,520
<i>…The temperature up to 140 degrees.
The temperature now is 90 degrees.</i>

505
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,880
<i>But it will rise
50 degrees in ten minutes.</i>

506
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,520
<i>Last warning.</i>

507
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,480
The Judge of the Change, sir.

508
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,160
Dr. Liet Kynes.

509
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,840
My Lord, Duke, welcome to Arrakis.

510
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,773
You are the imperial ecologist.

511
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,842
Thank you for the stillsuits.

512
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,960
They are Fremen make, the best.

513
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,400
With your permission, sir,
I must check the integrity--

514
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,680
It's all right.

515
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
It's all right.

516
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,920
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

517
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,320
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

518
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,209
Even this early in the morning

519
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:24,588
you wouldn't survive
two hours without one of these.

520
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,496
It cools the body and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

521
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:33,805
Your bodies movements provide the power.

522
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,240
Inside the mask you'll find a tube
to allow you to drink the recycled water.

523
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,480
In good-working order your suit won't lose
more than a thimble full of water a day.

524
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,400
Most impressive.

525
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,760
Let's have a look at you, lad.

526
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,080
-You've worn a stillsuit before?
-No, this is my first time.

527
00:55:56,587 --> 00:56:00,000
Your desert boots off at a slip fashion
at the ankles. Who taught you to do that?

528
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,600
It seemed the right way.

529
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,400
"He will know his customs
as if he was born with them."

530
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,960
Are you a Fremen?

531
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,393
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

532
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,456
Now.

533
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,120
Come and see the spice sands
on which your livelihood depends.

534
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,360
What would you do if your ornithopter
went down out here?

535
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,000
You wouldn't want to go down out there.
It's worm territory.

536
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,532
Dust cloud.

537
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,280
I see it.

538
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,920
That's one of your harvesters.

539
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,320
You can see the spice
scattered over the surface.

540
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,520
Rich spice bed by the color.

541
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,108
If you get a little higher
you'll have a better view.

542
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,640
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for worm sign.

543
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,920
Worm sign?

544
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,143
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

545
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:14,728
Worms travel deep but get closer
to the surface when they attack.

546
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,720
If you are patient we should see one.

547
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,840
-Worm always comes?
-Always, they're drawn by rhythmic noises.

548
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,957
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

549
00:58:26,573 --> 00:58:28,714
A shield is a death sentence
in the desert.

550
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,040
It attracts the worms
and drives them into a killing frenzy.

551
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,640
Is that a worm?

552
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,898
Big one.

553
00:58:49,703 --> 00:58:50,894
You have good eyes.

554
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:56,560
Calling crawler Delta Ajax 9.
Worm sign warning. Acknowledge.

555
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,240
<i>Who calls Delta Ajax 9? Over.</i>

556
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,280
-They seem pretty calm about it.
-Unlisted flight, Imperium business.

557
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,560
Worm sign, north and east of you.
3.7 kilometers.

558
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,720
<i>Delta Ajax 9, this is Spotter 1,
worm sighting confirmed.</i>

559
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,720
<i>Standby for contact fix.</i>

560
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,720
<i>Worm is on intercept course
to your position. Contact in five minutes.</i>

561
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,800
So what happens now?

562
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,818
They'll call the carryall
to lift the crawler.

563
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,201
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

564
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,160
<i>Calling carryall Alfa Zero.
Ready to docking sequence.</i>

565
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,080
<i>Contact five minutes, over.</i>

566
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
<i>Anybody got a visual on a carryall?</i>

567
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,800
There it is.

568
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,560
<i>This is carryall Alfa Zero
to Delta Ajax 9.</i>

569
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,407
<i>Approaching from your east.</i>

570
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:55,492
<i>Correcting altitude and preparing
docking and gripping.</i>

571
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,840
<i>Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.</i>

572
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,320
<i>-T-5.
-Copy that.</i>

573
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,589
<i>-Prepare to be airborne in 30 seconds.
-Docking sequence initiated.</i>

574
01:00:06,714 --> 01:00:07,996
<i>Brace yourselves.</i>

575
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,160
<i>Alpha Zero, we are short
on one point of contact.</i>

576
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,440
<i>-What is going on?
-It's one of the anchors. It's dead.</i>

577
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,960
Shit.

578
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,760
<i>Carryall, unable to proceed.
Unable to lift without that anchor.</i>

579
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,640
<i>All call. All call.</i>

580
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,928
<i>Any carryall in the sector,
please respond.</i>

581
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,535
<i>Spotter 1, give us an update. Over.</i>

582
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,120
<i>Hydraulics are dead.
We won't make it. You have to evacuate.</i>

583
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,040
-How many men on that crawler?
-Crawler of 21.

584
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,600
-Our ships can take six each.
-That's still three short.

585
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,120
We'll find a way.

586
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,680
<i>This is Duke Leto Atreides.</i>

587
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,890
<i>We're coming down
to extract the crew of Delta Ajax 9.</i>

588
01:00:58,103 --> 01:00:59,009
<i>Sit down on the left.</i>

589
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,360
The shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

590
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,200
Yes, Gurney, have our escort
throw out the shield generators.

591
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,200
And Paul, I want you at the back
of the thopter, guide them in.

592
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,040
Delta Ajax 9, put seven
men each in my ships now.

593
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,240
<i>Contact in two minutes.</i>

594
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,160
<i>It's getting close, guys.
We better abandon the ship now.</i>

595
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,800
Where are they?

596
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,423
<i>Sir, there is protocol for a reason,</i>

597
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:33,596
<i>if we take one step out
we're as good as dead.</i>

598
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:36,480
<i>Besides, we've got full load
of spice, we can't just leave--</i>

599
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,080
Damn the spice! I want
every man off that crawler now!

600
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,690
Seven over here, seven over there!

601
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,280
Run, run!

602
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,480
<i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

603
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,480
<i>Kwisatz Haderach awakes.</i>

604
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,360
Hurry! Get on!

605
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,280
It's here!

606
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,000
Paul!

607
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,560
Paul!

608
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,520
I recognize your footsteps, old man.

609
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,680
Get up. Let's go.

610
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,640
What's wrong with you?
Come on. Let's go.

611
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,080
Run!

612
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,280
"Bless the Maker and His water.
Bless the coming and going of Him.

613
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:11,440
May His passage cleanse the world.
And keep the world for His people."

614
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,480
-Hey, you cannot take such risks.
-Yes, sir.

615
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,040
-You do have responsibilities.
-I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

616
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,560
Dr. Kynes.

617
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,800
You saw it with your own eyes.

618
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,557
It's plain to see. Everything
they've left us is in shambles.

619
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:52,040
We've been set up to fail.

620
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,520
That carryall was just old.
The desert isn't kind to equipment.

621
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,960
You know what will happen if I don't get
spice production back on track?

622
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,960
I'm not here to take your part.

623
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:14,000
Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.

624
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,760
Take good care of your family.

625
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,160
The desert's not kind to humans either.

626
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:46,600
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.
You seem to be sensitive.

627
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,280
You'll be fine.

628
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,000
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

629
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,520
It wasn't an allergic reaction.

630
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,278
I had a vision.

631
01:07:12,986 --> 01:07:14,434
My eyes were wide open.

632
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,560
What did you see?

633
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,760
<i>Kwisatz Haderach…</i>

634
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,800
<i>You can see.</i>

635
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:44,320
<i>It's confusing, I thought
I saw my death, only it wasn't.</i>

636
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,680
<i>I know a knife is important somehow.</i>

637
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,080
<i>Someone will hand me a blade.</i>

638
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,440
<i>But I don't know who or when or where.</i>

639
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:03,360
<i>Some things though
are crystal clear. I can feel it.</i>

640
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,667
I know you're pregnant.

641
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,680
You can't know that.

642
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,920
I barely know that
and it's only been few weeks.

643
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,720
SALUSA SECUNDUS
IMPERIAL ARMY PLANET

644
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,520
What does the Baron want with us?

645
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,640
The Harkonnen outnumber Atreides.

646
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,160
Atreides legions are the finest
in the Imperium.

647
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,760
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

648
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:22,920
We are the Sardaukar, the Emperor's elite.
Anyone who defies us will fall.

649
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,160
Just so.

650
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,840
Three battalions as agreed.

651
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,120
As the the Emperor commands.
It will be done.

652
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,000
There's something you need
to know about Paul.

653
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,680
No. I don't think I wanna know.

654
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,187
Ever since you brought him before
your Reverend Mother

655
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:18,001
he hasn't been the same.

656
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,480
He's distracted.

657
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,760
Jessica, you gave me a son.

658
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,000
And from the moment he was born
I never questioned you.

659
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,440
I trusted you completely,
even when you walked in shadows.

660
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,600
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

661
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,440
If anything happens
will you protect our son?

662
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,480
With my life.

663
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,480
I'm not asking his mother,
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

664
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,000
Will you protect Paul?

665
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,360
Why are you having these thoughts?

666
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,440
Leto, this is not you.

667
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,840
I thought we'd have more time.

668
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,920
-Have a good night, Master Paul.
-Good night, Dr. Yueh.

669
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,080
You need to sleep.

670
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,680
No, not like that.

671
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,560
I should have married you.

672
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,600
Hawat. Security.

673
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,520
Security!

674
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,840
Sir. Sir.

675
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,840
The shield's come down.

676
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,040
God in Heaven.

677
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,440
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

678
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,280
With me!

679
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,360
Atreides!

680
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,000
Sardaukar!

681
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,800
I'm sorry, my lord.

682
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,600
But I've made a bargain with the Baron.

683
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,080
-Why?
-I had no choice.

684
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,483
The Harkonners have my wife, Wanna.

685
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:18,062
They take her apart like a doll.

686
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,160
I will buy her freedom
and you are the price.

687
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
For Paul. I will do what I can.

688
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,000
And you will kill a man for me.

689
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:40,840
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

690
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,680
If you bite them hard,
this tooth will crash.

691
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,680
Breathe out, and you will fill
the air with poison.

692
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,735
It will be your last breath.

693
01:19:52,695 --> 01:19:54,787
But if you choose your moment well

694
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,040
it will also be the Baron's.

695
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,840
Paul.

696
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:48,280
We will drop them in the desert,
and leave them to the worms.

697
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,840
Why not just cut their throats?

698
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,160
They might use a Truthsayer.

699
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,800
Then we can honestly say
that we didn't kill them.

700
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:09,120
The one with the scar is deaf.

701
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,360
To hell, dogs!

702
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,600
I've never had a high-born.

703
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,120
-You?
-Bene Gesserit ain't no high-born.

704
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,080
She is high-born enough for me.

705
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,160
Let's feed the kid to the worms
and give her a long goodbye.

706
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,400
Don't you dare touch my mother.

707
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,080
Don't talk.

708
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,760
No. You're not ready.

709
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,680
Remove her gag.

710
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,200
Shut up.

711
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,200
Find the right tone.

712
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,840
We're far enough.
Let's throw the boy off.

713
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,240
Remove her gag.

714
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,160
Kill him.

715
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,360
Set us free.

716
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,480
Stop. Cut the rope.

717
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,840
Give me the knife.

718
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,840
Your pitch was too forced.

719
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:30,920
It's a Fremkit.

720
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,480
They've crippled the ship.

721
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,840
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

722
01:28:36,597 --> 01:28:38,800
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

723
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:44,043
"If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive
there's an Atreides beacon in the Fremkit.

724
01:28:44,228 --> 01:28:46,276
God willing they'd be able to find you."

725
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,120
Milord Baron, Dr. Yueh.

726
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,672
The traitor?

727
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:00,900
What do you want?

728
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,760
I jammed their comms
and lowered their shields.

729
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:09,960
I gave you Duke and his family.

730
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:14,800
The bargain to the letter.
And what was I to do for you?

731
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,200
Deliver my wife from her agony.

732
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,640
Yes.

733
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:56,520
I said I'd set her free,
that you could join her.

734
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,160
So join her.

735
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,640
What do you think is next?

736
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,800
It's a thumper.

737
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,699
No stillsuits.

738
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:22,212
The one thing we actually need.

739
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,172
For hundreds of years
we've traded blood for blood.

740
01:30:31,337 --> 01:30:32,671
But no more.

741
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,400
Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead.

742
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,520
Tonight the house Atreides falls…

743
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,560
and your bloodline ends forever.

744
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,080
What did you say?

745
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,480
"Here I am, here I remain!"

746
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,720
-Kynes!
-It's not safe for you here.

747
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,899
Will you tell the Great House
of the Landsraad how we were betrayed?

748
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:02,417
How the best of them were murdered?

749
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:08,040
I am commanded to say nothing,
to see nothing.

750
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,240
The Emperor sent us here to die.

751
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,920
Spice in the tank.

752
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,493
That's the future. It's coming.

753
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:42,960
The Holy war is spreading across
the universe like an unquenchable fire.

754
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:00,760
Paul, you're scared. I can see it.
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

755
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:14,720
-Somebody help me, please.
-Paul…

756
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:17,300
It's coming.

757
01:36:17,384 --> 01:36:21,183
The Holy war is spreading across
the universe like an unquenchable fire.

758
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:26,280
A warrior religion that waves
the Atreides banner in my father's name.

759
01:36:26,494 --> 01:36:31,040
Fanatical legions worshiping
at the shine of my father's skull.

760
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:35,240
A war in my name!
Everyone shouting my name!

761
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,400
Paul.

762
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,920
Paul Atreides…

763
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,145
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

764
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:47,383
You are Duke Paul Atreides.

765
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,356
You know who you are.

766
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,080
Get off me!

767
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:58,680
You did this to me!
Your Bene Gesserit made me a freak!

768
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,720
My dad is dead.

769
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,800
Someone is near.

770
01:38:02,131 --> 01:38:04,640
You need to drink.

771
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,800
It's recycled water from the tent.

772
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,000
Sweat and tears.

773
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,480
All right. Let's get out of here.

774
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,480
It's Duncan.

775
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,280
My Lady. Paul…

776
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,240
-I'm so sorry… Your father…
-We know.

777
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,360
My Lord Duke.

778
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:06,304
Here.

779
01:40:08,557 --> 01:40:09,766
Drink this.

780
01:40:17,115 --> 01:40:20,280
The Harkonnens hit every population
center on the planet at once.

781
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,739
It must've been ten legions,
hundreds of ships.

782
01:40:22,999 --> 01:40:24,476
There were Sardaukar with them.

783
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,360
-At least two battalions.
-Are you sure?

784
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,800
You cross swords
with the Sardaukar, you know it.

785
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,120
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

786
01:40:36,187 --> 01:40:38,362
What says the Judge of the Change?

787
01:40:39,106 --> 01:40:41,180
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

788
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,200
Yet you risk your life to help us.

789
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,160
The storm is coming.

790
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,520
The storm will be here in a few hours.
We'll be safe here.

791
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:26,880
Do you know what this place is?
It's an old ecological testing station.

792
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,286
The were meant to tame the planet

793
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:34,748
and free the water locked
beneath the sands.

794
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:39,443
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

795
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:42,981
The work had begun
but then the spice was discovered.

796
01:41:43,065 --> 01:41:45,748
and suddenly no one wanted
the desert to go away.

797
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,614
Tanat, will you find
stillsuits to fit our visitors.

798
01:41:48,714 --> 01:41:49,706
Yes, Liet.

799
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:52,560
-Shamir, coffee service, please.
-Of course, Liet.

800
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:57,720
Who are you to the Fremen?

801
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,800
Do you know what the great houses
fear most, Dr. Kynes?

802
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,960
Exactly what has happened to us here.

803
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,000
The Sardaukar coming
and picking them off one by one.

804
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,600
Only together can they stand a chance
against the Imperium.

805
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,412
Would you bare witness?

806
01:43:05,305 --> 01:43:07,991
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here.

807
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,573
If they believe me…

808
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:14,797
There would be general warfare
between the great houses and the Emperor.

809
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,800
Chaos across the Imperium.

810
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:22,000
Let's suppose I present to the Emperor
with an alternative to chaos.

811
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,560
And the Emperor has no sons,
and his daughters are yet to marry.

812
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,392
You'd make a play for the throne?

813
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:32,108
The Emperor feared the Atreides.
He brought you here to kill you.

814
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:34,033
What don't you understand?

815
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,480
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

816
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,920
The Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib.

817
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,640
Careful.

818
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,240
The Voice from the Outer World
who will lead them to paradise.

819
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,682
Superstition.

820
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,560
I know you loved a Fremen warrior
and lost him in battle.

821
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,920
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

822
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,800
I've seen your dream.

823
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:19,359
As Emperor, Dr. Kynes,

824
01:44:19,459 --> 01:44:22,495
I could make a paradise for Arrakis
with the wave of my hand.

825
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,680
Do you really think he could be the Mahdi?

826
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,520
He looks very young.

827
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,760
Sardaukar!

828
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:21,280
-No! Duncan!
-Paul, no!

829
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,480
-Duncan, no!
-He's locked the door.

830
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,845
He's gone.

831
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:18,389
Duncan!

832
01:47:18,489 --> 01:47:20,108
We have to go. We have no choice.

833
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,600
Paul, run!

834
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,680
Come on, come on!

835
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:23,065
Follow the light. You'll find
a thopter ready to fly.

836
01:48:23,612 --> 01:48:25,278
That storm out there
is your best shot.

837
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,920
Above 5000 meters, it's mostly dust.
Climb into it. Stay on top.

838
01:48:30,111 --> 01:48:33,019
-Head south. Find the Fremen.
-You're not coming with us?

839
01:48:33,103 --> 01:48:34,288
It only sits two.

840
01:48:34,372 --> 01:48:37,835
I'll go to the next station
and report this attack to the Landsraad.

841
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,680
How?

842
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,754
I'm Fremen. The desert is my home.

843
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,840
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

844
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,600
Kynes, you have betrayed the emperor.

845
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,620
I serve only one master.

846
01:51:23,339 --> 01:51:26,140
His name is Shai-Hulud.

847
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,902
There are jet flyers behind us.

848
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,200
Paul, we are not high enough!

849
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,840
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.

850
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,320
Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration.

851
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,680
<i>See the friend.</i>

852
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:44,120
<i>The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve.</i>

853
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,440
<i>But a reality to experience.</i>

854
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,160
<i>A process that cannot be understand
by stopping it.</i>

855
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,520
<i>We must move with the flow
of the process.</i>

856
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:03,200
<i>We must join it.
We must float with it.</i>

857
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,240
<i>Let it go. Let it go.</i>

858
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,431
He hasn't fully healed yet.

859
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:56,240
We chased them into a Coriolis storm.

860
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,400
Wind's at 800 kilometers an hour.

861
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,760
Nothing survives such a storm.

862
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:11,160
They're dead. It's a certainty.

863
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,720
So it's done finally.

864
01:55:22,188 --> 01:55:27,480
Send word to Giedi Prime
to begin selling our spice reserves.

865
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:31,440
But slowly.
We don't want the price to fall.

866
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,360
You have no idea how much it cost me
to bring such a force to barrier.

867
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:40,160
Now I only have one requirement. Income.

868
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:44,840
So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard.

869
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,175
Yes, uncle.

870
01:55:47,945 --> 01:55:48,795
And the Fremen?

871
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,160
Kill them all.

872
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,360
We're above 5000 meters.

873
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:52,920
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

874
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,040
You breathe with this.

875
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,341
Now we have to find the Fremen.

876
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,680
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

877
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,440
<i>Paul…</i>

878
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,560
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

879
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:36,360
<i>Even a little desert mouse can survive.</i>

880
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,880
<i>You'll need to face your fears.</i>

881
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:47,320
<i>A friend will help you.</i>

882
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:50,680
<i>Follow the friend.</i>

883
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,432
You have much to learn.

884
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:58,720
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

885
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,520
Come with me.

886
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,600
The sietch, where Duncan lived.

887
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,760
Somewhere off that way.

888
02:02:37,306 --> 02:02:39,428
I can see the green over there.

889
02:02:40,004 --> 02:02:40,840
There.

890
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,796
That means Fremen live there.

891
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:52,000
We'll cross after dark.
That's how the Fremen do it.

892
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:56,121
We're about to enter worm territory.

893
02:02:56,919 --> 02:02:59,596
We can't walk like regular humans,
if we do - we're dead.

894
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:03,160
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do.
It's called the sand walk.

895
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,383
At least according
to the film books back home.

896
02:03:06,333 --> 02:03:07,472
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it.

897
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:10,880
Okay, follow me. Do the same moves.

898
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:24,931
I think this is the right direction.

899
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,920
It's close by. Let's get out of here.

900
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,120
Wait.

901
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,280
It's drum sand.

902
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,440
Run!

903
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:07,040
Go! Go!

904
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,040
It's a thumper.

905
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:25,080
Someone set off a thumper.

906
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,240
Paul, run!

907
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:58,200
How big are they? That was insane.

908
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,880
Someone called him.

909
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:14,600
We are not alone.

910
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:35,207
Do not run.

911
02:07:36,522 --> 02:07:39,573
You will only waste your bodies water.

912
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,280
Hold.

913
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:49,840
Stilgar.

914
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,360
Hey, you know me. I was there
when you came to my father's council.

915
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,520
This is the Duke's son.

916
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:00,120
Why are you waiting?
We need their water.

917
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,600
This is the boy I told you about.
We can't touch him.

918
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:07,720
-Is he Lisan al-Gaib?
-He hasn't proved himself.

919
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:11,280
-They're weaklings.
-Jamis…

920
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:15,560
There was a brave crossing
they made in the path of Shai-Hulud.

921
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:18,488
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

922
02:08:19,713 --> 02:08:21,459
Nor did his father.

923
02:08:21,543 --> 02:08:23,960
My thumper saved his life.

924
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:28,360
Go back to reason, Stilgar.
He's not The One.

925
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,440
We have powerful friends.

926
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:36,760
You help us off world, to Caladan,
you will be well rewarded.

927
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,840
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water in your flesh.

928
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,939
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

929
02:08:49,694 --> 02:08:51,416
He may have sanctuary.

930
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,325
But the woman isn't trained

931
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:58,346
and too old to learn.

932
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:30,817
Back, you dogs!

933
02:09:32,175 --> 02:09:33,504
She'll cut my throat.

934
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,880
Why didn't you say you were
a weirding woman and a fighter?

935
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,240
The conversation ran short.

936
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:48,483
Peace, woman, peace.

937
02:09:49,659 --> 02:09:50,825
I misjudged.

938
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,880
The sun is rising.
We must reach Sietch Tabr.

939
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:07,800
The fate of the strangers
will be decided there.

940
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:17,320
Until then, they are under my protection.

941
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:21,440
I give you my word.

942
02:10:28,847 --> 02:10:30,839
I would not have let you
hurt my friends.

943
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,791
They say you are the Mahdi.

944
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:59,312
But you look like a little boy.

945
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,320
You chose the hardest way up. Follow me.

946
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:08,720
Take off! Take off!

947
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,974
Give it to me.

948
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:22,181
You would have your own maula pistol
when you've earned it.

949
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:23,541
Give it to me.

950
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:32,859
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.
See that they are safe in the journey.

951
02:11:33,055 --> 02:11:33,971
Let's go.

952
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:36,760
I will not have them.

953
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:45,600
Jamis, I have spoken. Be still.

954
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,840
You talk like a leader,
but the strongest leads.

955
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:53,680
She bested you.

956
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,560
I invoke the Amtal.

957
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:00,080
-You may not challenge a sayyadina.
-Then who will fight in her name?

958
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:05,240
Jamis, don't do this. Don't.
The night is fading.

959
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:08,061
Then the sun will witness this death.

960
02:12:08,289 --> 02:12:09,958
Where is her champion?

961
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,360
I accept her champion.

962
02:12:52,986 --> 02:12:55,813
<i>Paul Atreides must die…</i>

963
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,160
<i>for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.</i>

964
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:10,905
<i>Don't be frightened. Don't resist.</i>

965
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,565
<i>When you take a life, you take your own.</i>

966
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:55,560
I don't believe you are the Lisan al-Gaib.

967
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:58,280
But I want you to die with honor.

968
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:12,120
This crysknife was given to me
by my great-aunt.

969
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:18,800
It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud,
the great sand worm.

970
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:22,560
This would be a great honor
if you to die holding it.

971
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:29,000
Where is the outworlder?

972
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:38,160
Jamis is a good fighter.
He won't let you suffer.

973
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,480
Chani…

974
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,360
Never mind.

975
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,960
May your knife chip and shatter.

976
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,004
You should welcome my blade.

977
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:03,600
This world will kill you.

978
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:07,640
Quicker this way.

979
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,409
Do you yield?

980
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,880
The boy does not know our rule.

981
02:16:52,031 --> 02:16:55,818
There is no yielding under the Amtal
rule, only death is the test of that.

982
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,696
-Is he toying with him?
-No.

983
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,561
Paul has never killed a man.

984
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:22,920
<i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

985
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:29,040
<i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

986
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,760
<i>Climb up. Rise.</i>

987
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:24,480
You're one of us now. A life for a life.

988
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:27,440
-Come with us to Sietch Tabr.
-No.

989
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,080
Paul needs to get off world.

990
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:32,067
You must have ways.
You have smugglers, you have ships.

991
02:19:32,214 --> 02:19:33,573
-No.
-You have--

992
02:19:34,654 --> 02:19:36,480
The Emperor sent us to this place.

993
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,547
And my father came…

994
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:45,000
Not for spice, not for the riches,

995
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:46,618
but for the strength of your people.

996
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,949
My road leads into the desert.

997
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,760
I could see it.

998
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:02,074
If you'll have us, we will come.

999
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:50,268
Desert power.

1000
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,184
This is only the beginning.

1001
02:21:21,719 --> 02:21:26,719
