164
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,057
Hey.

165
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,310
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

166
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,063
[sighs]

167
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,110
[animal chirping]

168
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,722
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

169
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,558
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

170
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,560
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

171
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,895
Out of the question.

172
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,271
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

173
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,481
like the rest of us.

174
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,857
I've been training
my whole life.

175
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,192
What is the point

176
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,568
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

177
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,903
You know why, Paul.

178
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,072
You're the future
of House Atreides.

179
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,574
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

180
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,368
Yes.

181
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,078
And look where that got him.

182
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,751
I need you by my side.

183
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,879
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

184
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,506
What danger?

185
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,466
The Fremen? The desert?

186
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,510
Political danger.

187
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,640
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

188
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,767
and this threatens
the Emperor.

189
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,104
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

190
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,273
he sets the stage for a war

191
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,483
which would weaken
both houses.

192
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,778
But if we hold firm,

193
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,947
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

194
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,324
we could be stronger
than ever.

195
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,034
What does that mean?

196
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,244
Mining spice,

197
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,829
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

198
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,122
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

199
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,623
No.

200
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,835
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

201
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,629
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

202
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,215
Here on Caladan,

203
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,801
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

204
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:49,722
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

205
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,768
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

206
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,228
Learn what I do.

207
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,063
What if I'm not, Dad?

208
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,108
Not what?

209
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,154
The future of House Atreides.

210
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,991
[Leto sighs]

211
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,960
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

212
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,758
I wanted to be a pilot.

213
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,385
You never told me that.

214
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,515
Your grandfather said,

215
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,352
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

216
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,064
He's called to it,
and he answers."

217
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,651
And if your answer is no...

218
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,948
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

219
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,035
my son.

220
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,132
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

221
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,471
In their memory...

222
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,809
give it a try.

223
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,526
[grunting]

224
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,820
[Gurney] Don't stand
with your back to the door.

225
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,572
How many times
do we have to tell you?

226
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,074
[Paul grunts]
I could tell it was you

227
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,909
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

228
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,745
[Gurney] Someone
might imitate my stride.

229
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,080
[Paul] I know the difference.

230
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,748
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

231
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,585
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

232
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,088
Choose your blade.

233
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,923
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

234
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,050
Give us a song instead.

235
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,723
[smacks lips] That's rude.

236

Come on.

I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

-Mood?
-Yeah.

251
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,811
What's mood to do with it?

252
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,646
You fight
when the necessity arises,

253

no matter the mood.

But look down, my lord.

You'd have joined me in death.

00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,636
I see you found the mood.

Will it be that bad?

265

You don't get it, do you?

266
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,362
You don't really understand

267
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,115
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

268

For 80 years,

269
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,246
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

270
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,832
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

271
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,042
Can you imagine the wealth?

272
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,044
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

273
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,630
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

274
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,758
They're not human,
they're brutal!

275
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,760
You have to be ready.

The last of our ships

It's done.

[Vladimir] Very good.

00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,903
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

283
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,030
How can the Emperor

284
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,657
[shouting]
take everything we've built

285
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,035
and give it to that Duke?

286
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,411
How?

287
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,414
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

The Atreides' voice is rising,

292

and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

about your dreams.

How does she know
about my dreams?

And why is Dr. Yueh here?

He only needs a moment.

What, because
I'm a duke's son?

Because you are Jessica's son.

You have more

On Arrakis.

391

Have you dreamt of her before?

Many times.

[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

[Mohiam] You chose
to train him in the Way,

400
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,011
in defiance of our rule.

401
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,637
He wields our power.

402
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,515
He had to be
tested to the limits.

403
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,852
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

404
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,896
You were told
to bear only daughters.

405
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,355
But you, in your pride,

406
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,357
thought you could
produce the<i> Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

407

Was I wrong?

408
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,695
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

409

If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

But our plans
are measured in centuries.

We have other prospects

How bad is it?

653
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,478
[Thufir] These are spice silos.

654
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,941
We're meant
to fill every crate.

655
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,943
[Paul] All of them?

656
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,863
Every 25 standard days.

657
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,282
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

658
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,075
[Paul] But who's
meant to arbitrate?

659
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,368
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

660
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,745
to oversee the transition?

661
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,246
Who did the Emperor appoint?

662
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,124
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

663
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,709
Been here 20 years.

664
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,627
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

665
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,756
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

666
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,215
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

667
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,760
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

668
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,303
A meeting's long overdue.

669
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,597
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

670
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,182
A hostage. [chuckles]

671
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,558
I love it.

672
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,726
Hmm.

673
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,061
-[engine roaring]
-He's here, my lord.

674
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,919
[Duncan well-wishing
in Chakobsa]

675
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,962
[in English] Take care
of them. They are friends.

676
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,005
[Paul] Duncan!

677
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,465
[Duncan] Ah! My boy!

678
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,718
[both laughing]

679
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430
I swear you're getting taller.

680
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,182
[Paul] Well,
you smell much worse.

681
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,854
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

682
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,022
Hidden in the desert,

683
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,816
in a community
called a<i> sietch.</i>

684
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,192
Stilgar, the leader
of that<i> sietch,</i>

685
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,069
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

686
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,488
This<i> sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

687
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,656
It's underground.

688
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,699
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

689
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,451
How big was the place?

690
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,995
I'd say 10,000 people.

691
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,622
And there are
hundreds of<i> sietches.</i>

692
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,250
Millions of Fremen.

693
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,502
You were right.

694
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,922
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

695
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,216
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

696
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,759
I never saw them.

697
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,554
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

698
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,222
And I gotta tell you,

699
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,724
I have never come
so close to dying.

700
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,602
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

701
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,271
They fight like demons.

702
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,231
Desert power.

703
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,402
Duncan.

704
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,945
-Well done.
-Thank you, my lord.

705
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,405
[man] Sire.

706
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,074
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

707
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,244
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

708
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,537
Let him pass.

709
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,555
[Gurney] Stop there.

710
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,307
Hey! Hey!

711
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:09,895
Mm.

712
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,897
[Leto] Stilgar.

713
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,024
Welcome.

714
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,611
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

715
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,487
of any man that respects mine.

716
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,699
[inhales deeply]

717
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,825
[Stilgar] Hmm.

718
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,703
[inhales deeply]

719
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,580
[Duncan] Hold.

720
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,750
[clears throat]
Thank you, Stilgar,

721
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,253
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

722
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,672
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

723
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,512
[Leto snorts]

724
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,765
[Leto] I'm glad you've come.

725
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,643
I believe your people and mine

726
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,019
have much
to offer one another.

727
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,479
No, no, you are Outworlders.

728
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,230
You come here for the spice,

729
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,775
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

730
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,569
That's true.

731
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,407
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

732
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,035
Name what you want.

733
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,328
If it's in my power to grant,

734
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,871
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

735
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,832
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our<i> sietches.</i>

736
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,752
Do not trespass in our lands.

737
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,297
The desert was ours
long before you came.

738
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,174
So, come and dig your spice,

739
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,467
but when you have it,

740
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,678
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

741
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,554
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

742
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,432
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

743
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,102
[Leto] Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

744
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,520
The Emperor

745
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,356
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

746
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,191
to rule and protect.

747
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,777
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

748
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,697
if duty compels me.

749
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,700
But your<i> sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

750
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,369
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

751
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,709
That's very honorable.

752
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,461
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

753
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,714
[Paul] Won't you stay?

754
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,173
We would honor you.

755
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,343
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

756
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,555
[speaking Chakobsa]

757
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,273
I don't like him.

758
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,608
Our plan bears fruit.

759
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,110
But it will take time?

760
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,445
Yes.

761
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,698
It will take time.

762
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,827
Here, this is for you.

763
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,916
It's a paracompass.

764
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,502
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

765
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,213
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

766
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,424
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

767
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,176
[Paul] The Fremen make these?

768
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,094
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

769
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,596
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

770
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,639
[Gurney] What the hell
is a sand compactor?

771
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,934
[Duncan]
That's a sand compactor.

772
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,102
[all chuckle]

773
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,938
My God, man,
you've gone native.

774
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,315
You admire them.

775
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,109
I do.

776
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,862
They're fierce but loyal.

777
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,739
They're attuned to the desert.

778
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,074
Part of it.

779
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,284
It's part of them.

780
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,535
You wait till you see it.

781
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,788
It's beautiful out there.

782
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,085
[announcer]
<i>Sunrise warning, all workers.</i>

783

[dramatic music continues]

789
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,256
The Judge of the Change, sire.

790
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,299
Dr. Liet Kynes.

791
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,801
My lord Duke.

792
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,178
Welcome to Arrakis.

793
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,347
[Paul] You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

794
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,349
Thank you for the stillsuits.

795
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,518
They are of Fremen make.

796
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,686
The best.

797
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,062
With your permission, sire,

798
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,522
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

799
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,731
[Leto] Whoa.

800
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,650
It's all right.

801
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,487
It's all right.

802
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:33,158
[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

803
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,872
A stillsuit

804
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,917
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

805
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,586
Even this early
in the morning,

806
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,463
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

807
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,633
It cools the body

808
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,554
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

809
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,932
Your body's movements
provide the power.

810
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,726
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

811
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,895
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

812
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,229
[Leto] Mm.

813
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,647
In good working order,

Always. They're drawn

Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

It attracts the worms

Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1334

has moved against us here?

If they believe me,

there would be general warfare

the Emperor

1342
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,586
with an alternative to chaos.

1343
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:49,588
The Emperor has no sons.

And his daughters
have yet to marry.

You'd make a play

1346
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:56,386
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1347
01:47:56,469 --> 01:47:58,138
He brought you here
to kill you.
