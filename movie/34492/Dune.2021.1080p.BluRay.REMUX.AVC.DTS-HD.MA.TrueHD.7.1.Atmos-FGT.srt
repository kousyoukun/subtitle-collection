1
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,434
My planet Arrakis is so beautiful

2
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,977
when the sun is low.

3
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,107
Rolling over the sands...

4
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,402
you can see spice in the air.

5
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:25,211
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

6
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:30,383
The outsiders race against time
to avoid the heat of the day.

7
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,396
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

8
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,400
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

9
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,324
These outsiders, the Harkonnens,

10
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,410
came long before I was born.

11
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,453
By controlling spice production,

12
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,330
they became obscenely rich.

13
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,457
Richer than the Emperor himself.

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,170
Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

15
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,671
but one day,

16
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,799
by Imperial decree, they were gone.

17
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,184
Why did the Emperor choose this path?

18
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,979
And who will our next oppressors be?

19
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,990
It's good you're up early.

20
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,827
Your father wants you in full dress

21
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,495
before the Emperor's Herald arrives.

22
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,664
Full dress?

23
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,749
Military?

24
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,377
- Ceremonial.

25
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,337
Why do we have to go
through all this

26
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,588
when it's already been decided?

27
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,258
Ceremony.

28
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:18,968
Mm.

29
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,803
Thank you.

30
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,515
If you want it, make me give it to you.

31
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,976
Use the Voice.

32
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,853
Mom, I just woke up.

33
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,279
Give me the water.

34
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,240
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

35
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,644
Give me the water.

36
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,283
Almost.

37
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,868
Almost?

38
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,621
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

39
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,915
-  Mm-hmm.
- You look tired.

40
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,292
More dreams?

41
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,424
No.

42
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,970
Extreme temperatures

43
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,805
and treacherous weather events

44
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,559
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,

45
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,520
with sandstorms powerful enough

46
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,854
to cut through metal.

47
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,024
Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen

48
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,652
have adapted well enough to survive.

49
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,448
Preferring to inhabit
the remotest regions of Arrakis,

50
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,243
the Fremen share the deep desert

51
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,911
with the giant sandworms

52
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,539
known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud.

53
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,209
Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe

54
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,253
their characteristic blue eyes,

55
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,880
the Eyes of Ibad.

56
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,966
Little else is known of the Fremen,

57
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,886
except that they are dangerous
and unreliable.

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,890
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting

59
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,725
extremely hazardous.

60
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,729
For the Fremen,
spice is the sacred hallucinogen

61
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,064
which preserves life

62
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,358
and brings enormous health benefits.

63
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,694
For the Imperium,

64
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,821
spice is used by the navigators

65
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,614
of the Spacing Guild

66
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,242
to find safe paths between the stars.

67
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:49,827
Without spice,

68
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,496
interstellar travel is impossible,

69
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,164
making it by far

70
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,167
the most valuable substance
in the universe.

71
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,093
Smile, Gurney.

72
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,512
I am smiling.

73
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,641
How much will it cost them,

74
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,060
traveling all this way
for this formality?

75
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,686
Three Guild Navigators.

76
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,523
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

77
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,292
By the grace of Shaddam IV
of House Corrino,

78
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,795
ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne

79
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,255
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

80
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,009
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

81
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,554
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

82
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,224
representatives of the Spacing Guild

83
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,435
and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

84
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,564
The Emperor has spoken.

85
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,404
"House Atreides shall immediately
take control of Arrakis

86
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,615
and serve as its steward."

87
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,702
Do you accept?

88
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,380
We are House Atreides.

89
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,635
There is no call we do not answer,
there is no faith that we betray.

90
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:16,014
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

91
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,143
House Atreides accepts.

92
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,689
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

93
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,818
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

94
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,869
Your seal.

95
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,281
So, it's done?

96
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,159
It's done.

97
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:44,812
How was it?

98
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,022
Stabilizers are too loose.

99
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,358
- We'll dial it in.
- Thank you, my friend.

100
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,484
Got it.

101
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,236
Duncan.

102
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,403
My boy.

103
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,780
- Hey. Hey.

104
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,281
Paul, my boy.

105
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,868
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow.

106
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,995
With the advance team.

107
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,747
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow

108
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:04,873
with the advance team.

109
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,668
I'd like you to take me with you.

110
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,753
You would?

111
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,548
Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no.

112
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,050
Duncan.

113
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,010
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

114
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,721
What's going on?

115
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:20,848
Can I trust you with something?

116
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,307
Always. You know that.

117
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,899
I've been having dreams.

118
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,445
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

119
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,372
Okay.

120
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,207
So?

121
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,835
I saw you.

122
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,506
With the Fremen.

123
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,425
Ah.

124
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,510
So, I do find them.

125
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,721
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

126
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,474
Lanville!

127
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,649
I saw you lying dead.

128
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,152
Fallen in battle.

129
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,697
It felt like if I had been there,

130
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,699
you'd be alive.

131
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,581
First off, I'm not gonna die.

132
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,999
You're not taking me seriously.

133
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,876
That's why you want
to come with me. Listen.

134
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,046
Dreams make good stories,

135
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,506
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

136
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,383
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

137
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,094
Look at you. Put on some muscle?

138
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,262
I did?

139
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,639
No.

140
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,392
Hey.

141
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,895
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

142
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,557
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

143
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,851
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

144
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,145
I've studied the Fremen language,
I'd be an asset.

145
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,438
Out of the question.

146
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,982
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis,

147
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,066
like the rest of us.

148
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,567
I've been training my whole life.

149
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,152
What is the point if I'm not allowed

150
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,029
- to face some actual risk?
- You know why, Paul.

151
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,782
You're the future of House Atreides.

152
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,118
And Grandfather fought bulls for sport!

153
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,077
Yes.

154
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,496
And look where that got him.

155
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,627
I need you by my side.

156
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,214
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

157
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,716
What danger?

158
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,260
The Fremen? The desert?

159
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,803
Political danger.

160
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,891
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

161
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,185
and this threatens the Emperor.

162
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,731
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens
and making it ours,

163
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,607
he sets the stage for a war

164
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,901
which would weaken both houses.

165
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,238
But if we hold firm,

166
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,741
and tap the true power of Arrakis,

167
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,617
we could be stronger than ever.

168
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,202
What does that mean?

169
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,497
Mining spice,
keeping the Fremen in their place?

170
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,332
- We'd be no better than Harkonnens.
- No.

171
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,045
By making an alliance with the Fremen.

172
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,089
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

173
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,675
Here on Caladan,

174
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,553
we've ruled by air power and sea power.

175
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,140
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

176
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,353
I want you sitting in on my Council.

177
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,730
Learn what I do.

178
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,398
What if I'm not, Dad?

179
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,734
Not what?

180
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,155
The future of House Atreides.

181
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,128
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

182
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,801
I wanted to be a pilot.

183
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,970
You never told me that.

184
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,517
Your grandfather said,

185
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,561
"A great man doesn't seek to lead.

186
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,398
He's called to it, and he answers."

187
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,194
And if your answer is no...

188
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,075
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

189
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,620
my son.

190
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,676
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

191
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,722
In their memory...

192
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:16,977
give it a try.

193
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,446
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

194
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,491
How many times do we have to tell you?

195
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,993
I could tell it was you

196
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,744
by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

197
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,997
Someone
might imitate my stride.

198
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,999
I know the difference.

199
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,667
Are you the new Weapons Master?

200
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,337
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

201
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,548
Choose your blade.

202
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,300
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

203
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,135
Give us a song instead.

204
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,474
That's rude.

205
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:14,993
Come on.

206
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,620
Come on.

207
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,704
Old man.

208
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,968
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

209
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,518
I guess I'm not in the mood today.

210
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,354
- Mood?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,521
What's mood to do with it?

212
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,440
You fight when the necessity arises,

213
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,524
no matter the mood.

214
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,651
Now fight!

215
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,157
Come on!

216
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,837
- I have you.

217
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,422
Aye.

218
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,758
But look down, my lord.

219
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,593
You'd have joined me in death.

220
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,388
I see you found the mood.

221
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,943
Will it be that bad?

222
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,653
You don't get it, do you?

223
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,239
You don't really understand

224
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,700
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

225
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,912
For 80 years,

226
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,081
Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen.

227
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,583
80 years of owning the spice fields.

228
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,502
Can you imagine the wealth?

229
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,879
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

230
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,340
You never met Harkonnens
before, I have.

231
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,676
They're not human, they're brutal!

232
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,220
You have to be ready.

233
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,597
Lord Baron.

234
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,017
Rabban.

235
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,187
The last of our ships have left Arrakis.

236
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,689
It's done.

237
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,441
Very good.

238
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,321
Uncle, how can we let this happen?

239
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,947
How can the Emperor...

240
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,409
...take everything
we've built

241
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,411
and give it to that Duke?

242
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,080
How?

243
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,582
Don't be too sure it's an act of love.

244
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,378
What does he mean?

245
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,220
When is a gift not a gift?

246
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,100
The Atreides' voice is rising,

247
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,770
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

248
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,609
A dangerous, jealous man.

249
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,806
Paul.

250
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,851
Paul, wake up.

251
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,442
What's wrong?

252
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,860
Get dressed and come with me.

253
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,341
What is this?

254
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,885
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

255
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,846
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

256
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,390
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

257
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,976
She would like to meet you.

258
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,978
Why?

259
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,564
She wants to know about your dreams.

260
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,109
How does she know about my dreams?

261
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,364
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

262
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,907
He only needs a moment.

263
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,284
Hello, young master.

264
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,162
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

265
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,753
What's happening?

266
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,735
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

267
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,626
Paul...

268
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:11,784
Who are you?

269
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,915
Defiance in the eyes.

270
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,834
Like his father.

271
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,252
Leave us.

272
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,255
You must do everything
the Reverend Mother tells you.

273
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,510
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

274
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,678
Come here.

275
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,263
Kneel.

276
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,311
How dare you use the Voice on me?

277
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,028
Put your right
hand in the box.

278
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,157
Your mother bade you obey me.

279
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,085
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar.

280
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,629
A poison needle.

281
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,130
Instant death.

282
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,591
The test is simple.

283
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,677
Remove your hand from the box

284
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,553
and you die.

285
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,473
What's in the box?

286
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,101
Pain.

287
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,938
- No need to call the guards.

288
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,691
Your mother stands behind that door.

289
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,359
No one would get past her.

290
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:34,867
Why are you doing this?

291
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,832
An animal caught in a trap
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

292
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,834
What will you do?

293
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,325
- Silence.

294
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,545
I must not fear.

295
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,882
I must not fear.

296
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,015
Fear is the mind-killer.

297
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,351
Fear

298
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,896
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

299
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,650
And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it

300
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:50,943
to pass over me and through me.

301
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,668
And when it has gone past...

302
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,013
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

303
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,769
And where the fear has gone,

304
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:26,896
there will be nothing.

305
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,152
Only I will remain.

306
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:38,616
Enough.

307
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,468
Like sifting sand through a screen,

308
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,554
we sift people.

309
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,599
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

310
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:04,851
like an animal,

311
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,811
we could not let you live.

312
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,438
You inherit too much power.

313
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,816
What, because I'm a duke's son?

314
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,484
Because you are Jessica's son.

315
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,071
You have more than one birthright, boy.

316
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,032
Jessica?

317
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,916
You've been training him in the Way.

318
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,464
Tell me about these dreams.

319
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,759
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

320
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,346
A girl.

321
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,140
On Arrakis.

322
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,267
Have you dreamt of her before?

323
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,731
Many times.

324
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,444
Do you often dream things that happen

325
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,737
just as you dreamed them?

326
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,325
Not exactly.

327
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,288
Goodbye, young human.

328
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,582
I hope you live.

329
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,009
Did you have to go that far?

330
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,677
You chose
to train him in the Way,

331
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,471
in defiance of our rule.

332
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,473
He wields our power.

333
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,350
He had to be tested to the limits.

334
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,728
So much potential, wasted in a male.

335
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,648
You were told to bear only daughters.

336
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,982
But you, in your pride,

337
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,068
thought you could
produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

338
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,569
Was I wrong?

339
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,780
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

340
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,950
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

341
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,911
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

342
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,706
But our plans are measured in centuries.

343
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,166
We have other prospects

344
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,460
if he fails his promise.

345
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,006
Do you see so little hope?

346
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,760
On Arrakis, we have done
all we can for you.

347
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,679
A path has been laid.

348
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,098
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

349
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,604
Paul.

350
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,357
What does it mean?

351
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,277
That I could be The One?

352
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,820
You heard.

353
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,616
The Bene Gesserit serve

354
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,702
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

355
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,288
but there's more to it.

356
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,999
You steer the politics of the Imperium

357
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,459
from the shadows.

358
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,252
I know.

359
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,004
You don't know everything.

360
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,215
For thousands of years,

361
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,551
we've been carefully crossing bloodlines

362
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,845
- to bring forth...
- The One?

363
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,639
A mind...

364
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,729
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

365
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,231
Past and future.

366
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,944
Who can help us into a better future.

367
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,364
We think he's very close now.

368
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,494
Some believe he's here.

369
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,625
All part of a plan.

370
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,889
Shield.

371
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,517
"My lungs taste the air of Time,

372
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,185
Blown past falling sand..."

373
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,189
Thufir Hawat.

374
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,362
Young master!

375
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,656
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

376
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,658
Exciting, to say the least.

377
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,535
My lord.

378
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,370
How are you, old friend?

379
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,415
My advance team has secured the city.

380
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,792
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

381
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,129
My lady.

382
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,385
Lisan al-Gaib!

383
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,446
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

384
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,823
Lisan al-Gaib!

385
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,659
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

386
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,662
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

387
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,665
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

388
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,960
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

389
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,672
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

390
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,633
They follow their old masters' rules.

391
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,717
Mandatory attendance.

392
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,677
That's Harkonnen love out there.

393
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,685
Atreides!

394
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,648
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

395
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,693
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

396
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,071
Atreides! Atreides!

397
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,200
Let's get you out of the sun.

398
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,161
The heat can kill in this place.

399
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,304
They were pointing at us.

400
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,723
What are they shouting?

401
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,853
Lisan al-Gaib.
"Voice from the Outer World."

402
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,563
It's their name for "messiah."

403
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,483
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

404
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,153
Planting superstitions.

405
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,822
Preparing the way, Paul.

406
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,075
These people
have waited for centuries

407
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,452
for the Lisan al-Gaib.

408
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,620
They see you,

409
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,956
they see the signs.

410
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,044
They see what they've been
told to see.

411
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,551
We're good to go.

412
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,179
Shield Wall.

413
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,516
Protects the city from the weather
and the worms.

414
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,399
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

415
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,945
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

416
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,238
on our comms system.

417
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,076
It's so quiet.

418
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,412
Yeah.

419
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,872
That's what worries me, too.

420
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,298
There's the spaceport

421
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,509
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

422
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,386
Our two most vulnerable points.

423
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,013
I want you guarding them.

424
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,765
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

425
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,309
- we're dead here.
-  My lord.

426
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,687
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

427
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,693
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

428
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,155
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

429
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,573
That's what they say.

430
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,074
That's what they say.

431
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,914
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

432
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:15,724
What is your name?

433
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,726
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

434
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,605
The rest of you may go.

435
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,106
Thank you.

436
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,610
Shadout.

437
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,071
It's an old Chakobsa word.

438
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,281
"Well-dipper."

439
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,619
You know the ancient tongues?

440
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:36,912
I know many things.

441
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,248
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

442
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,710
If you mean to harm me,

443
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,755
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

444
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,132
it won't be enough.

445
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,303
The weapon is meant as a gift

446
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,431
if you are truly The One.

447
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,907
Do you know this?

448
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,119
It's a crysknife.

449
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,165
Do you know its meaning?

450
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,838
It's a maker...

451
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,429
A maker of the deep desert.

452
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,726
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

453
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,978
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

454
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:44,980
Lisan al-Gaib.

455
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,648
The mother and the son.

456
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,698
It is yours.

457
00:42:56,825 --> 00:43:00,036
Tooth of Shai-Hulud.

458
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,486
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!

459
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:37,324
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

460
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,585
Hello.

461
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,507
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

462
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,219
They're out here.

463
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,472
Hmm. Fremen pilgrims.

464
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,141
They don't care about heatstroke.

465
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,270
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

466
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,857
Oh, these aren't indigenous.

467
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,193
They can't survive without me.

468
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,111
Each one of these

469
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,531
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

470
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,535
Twenty palm trees.

471
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,120
A hundred lives.

472
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,874
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

473
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,000
No, no, no.

474
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,460
These are sacred.

475
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:36,508
Old dream.

476
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,852
The largest and most dangerous

477
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,813
organism on Arrakis is the sandworm,

478
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,650
capable of reaching
400 meters in length.

479
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,445
To avoid making rhythmic noises,
which attract the sandworms,

480
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:02,325
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,

481
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,120
a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm

482
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:08,123
which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.

483
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:12,043
What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis

484
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,795
is thanks to the Fremen,

485
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,798
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants

486
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,759
such as saguaro, burrobush,

487
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:23,430
sand-verbena and incense bush.

488
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:27,559
The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,

489
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,437
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

490
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,982
These plants cling to life

491
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,902
in a parched, nutrient-poor landscape.

492
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:48,974
It's a hunter-seeker.

493
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:50,934
The operator must be nearby.

494
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:57,983
The Harkonnen agent
was cemented

495
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,401
into that hole six weeks ago.

496
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,695
Ran the hunter-seeker
through a waterpipe

497
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:02,696
inside the walls.

498
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,366
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

499
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,284
You have my resignation.

500
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,995
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

501
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,454
Sire, my honor demands...

502
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,123
They tried to take the life of my son!

503
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,875
I don't give a damn about your honor.

504
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,253
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

505
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:19,713
Your Grace.

506
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,638
The thing must leave.

507
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,057
You can speak without fear.

508
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,269
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

509
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:35,770
Get out.

510
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,401
It understands.

511
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,236
Activate silence.

512
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:00,295
It must never be known.

513
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,923
There's no satellites
over Arrakis.

514
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,634
The Atreides will die in the dark.

515
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,387
On that matter,

516
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,099
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

517
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,934
But his wife is under our protection

518
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,020
and by extension, her son.

519
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,065
Allow them the dignity of exile.

520
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,529
House Harkonnen would never dream

521
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,990
of violating the sanctity of your order.

522
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,868
I give you my word.

523
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,536
We will not harm them.

524
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,600
If the Duke's son lives...

525
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,936
No Atreides will live.

526
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,438
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

527
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:01,898
She sees too much.

528
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,650
I said I would not harm them.

529
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,026
And I shall not.

530
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,153
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

531
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,740
And the desert takes the weak.

532
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,619
My desert.

533
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,873
My Arrakis.

534
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,544
My Dune.

535
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,966
Your first strategy meeting.

536
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,592
Paul Atreides,

537
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,845
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

538
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:33,138
like a hero of old.

539
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,350
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

540
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:38,935
Gotta keep an eye on you.

541
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,104
Attention!

542
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:50,446
Let's get started.

543
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:54,659
Thufir. Operations.

544
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,620
I secured a copy
of the Harkonnens' account books.

545
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,166
The Harkonnens were taking

546
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,043
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

547
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,589
"They shall suck
of the abundance of the seas,

548
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,257
and the treasure hid in the sand."

549
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,759
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

550
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,845
Not with the equipment they left us.

551
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,055
How bad is it?

552
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,147
These are spice silos.

553
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,942
We're meant to fill every crate.

554
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,069
All of them?

555
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,906
Every 25 standard days.

556
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,992
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

557
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,827
But who's meant to arbitrate?

558
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,120
Isn't there a Judge of the Change

559
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,413
to oversee the transition?

560
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,789
Who did the Emperor appoint?

561
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,751
Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist.

562
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,294
Been here 20 years.

563
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,338
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

564
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,757
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

565
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:52,884
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

566
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,428
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

567
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,096
A meeting's long overdue.

568
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,390
And we'll get a bit
of Imperial protection.

569
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,059
A hostage.

570
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:02,185
I love it.

571
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,311
Hmm.

572
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,563
- He's here, my lord.

573
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,589
Take care of them.
They are friends.

574
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:32,924
Duncan!

575
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:34,384
Ah! My boy!

576
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,140
I swear you're getting taller.

577
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,517
Well, you smell much worse.

578
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,606
For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen.

579
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,067
Hidden in the desert,
in a community called a sietch.

580
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:54,487
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch,
has come with me to meet you, sire.

581
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,115
This sietch, how is it hidden?

582
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,366
It's underground.

583
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,159
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

584
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:01,577
How big was the place?

585
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:03,663
I'd say 10,000 people.

586
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,124
And there are hundreds of sietches.

587
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,043
Millions of Fremen.

588
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:10,837
You were right.

589
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:14,340
The Harkonnen estimate
was 50,000 on the whole planet.

590
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,676
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

591
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,177
I never saw them.

592
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,638
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

593
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,557
And I gotta tell you,

594
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,934
I have never come so close to dying.

595
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,520
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

596
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:29,731
They fight like demons.

597
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,524
Desert power.

598
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:35,445
Duncan.

599
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,822
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

600
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,906
Sire.

601
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,492
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

602
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,370
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

603
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,039
Let him pass.

604
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:03,681
Stop there.

605
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:05,850
Hey! Hey!

606
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,521
Mm.

607
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,523
Stilgar.

608
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:14,650
Welcome.

609
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,321
Sir, I respect the personal dignity

610
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,822
of any man that respects mine.

611
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,452
Hmm.

612
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:28,790
Hold.

613
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,168
Thank you, Stilgar,

614
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,338
for the gift of your body's moisture.

615
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,257
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

616
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:47,517
I'm glad you've come.

617
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,061
I believe your people and mine

618
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:51,813
have much to offer one another.

619
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,231
No, no, you are Outworlders.

620
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:54,982
You come here for the spice,

621
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,110
you take it, giving nothing in return.

622
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,321
That's true.

623
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:05,159
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

624
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:07,537
Name what you want.

625
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,123
If it's in my power to grant,
I'll give it and ask for nothing.

626
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:13,459
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our sietches.

627
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:16,170
Do not trespass in our lands.

628
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,882
The desert was ours
long before you came.

629
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,885
So, come and dig your spice,
but when you have it,

630
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:25,346
go back to this side of the Shield Wall

631
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,432
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

632
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,184
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

633
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,019
Gurney, just...
just a moment.

634
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,105
The Emperor

635
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,858
has given me Arrakis as my fief

636
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,651
to rule and protect.

637
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,320
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

638
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,072
if duty compels me.

639
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,534
But your sietches will be yours forever.

640
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,912
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

641
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,960
That's very honorable.

642
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,213
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

643
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,381
Won't you stay?

644
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,425
We would honor you.

645
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,470
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

646
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,816
I don't like him.

647
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,152
Our plan bears fruit.

648
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,570
But it will take time?

649
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:23,988
Yes.

650
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,033
It will take time.

651
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,370
Here, this is for you.

652
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,584
It's a paracompass.

653
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,837
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

654
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,881
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

655
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,884
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

656
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,427
The Fremen make these?

657
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,721
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,

658
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,056
and all kinds of ingenious things.

659
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,099
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

660
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,645
That's a sand compactor.

661
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,190
My God, man, you've gone native.

662
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,775
You admire them.

663
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,361
I do.

664
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:05,947
They're fierce but loyal.

665
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,032
They're attuned to the desert.

666
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:09,492
Part of it.

667
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,077
It's part of them.

668
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,204
You wait till you see it.

669
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,248
It's beautiful out there.

670
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,670
Sunrise warning,
all workers.

671
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,631
Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.

672
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,675
We are currently 90 degrees,

673
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:28,886
and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.

674
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,305
Last warning call.

675
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:06,674
The Judge of the Change, sire.

676
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,342
Dr. Liet Kynes.

677
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,261
My lord Duke.

678
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:12,513
Welcome to Arrakis.

679
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,724
You're the Imperial Ecologist.

680
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:16,767
Thank you for the stillsuits.

681
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,644
They are of Fremen make.

682
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,146
The best.

683
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,689
With your permission, sire,

684
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,024
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

685
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:24,650
Whoa.

686
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,110
It's all right.

687
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:29,363
It's all right.

688
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,618
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

689
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:42,710
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

690
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,463
Even this early in the morning,

691
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,965
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

692
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,217
It cools the body

693
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,096
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

694
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,892
Your body's movements
provide the power.

695
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,269
Inside the mask, you'll find a tube

696
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,605
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

697
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,731
Mm.

698
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,316
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

699
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,193
more than a thimbleful of water a day.

700
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,778
Most impressive.

701
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,198
Let's have a look at you, lad.

702
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,743
You've...

703
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:17,370
worn a stillsuit before?

704
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,579
No, this is my first time.

705
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:24,085
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

706
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,211
Who taught you to do that?

707
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,213
It seemed the right way.

708
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,597
Are you Fremen?

709
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:41,560
I am accepted
in both sietch and village.

710
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:47,566
Now, come and see the spice sands
on which your livelihood depends.

711
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:26,939
What would you do

712
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,566
if your ornithopter went down out here?

713
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,776
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

714
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:32,778
It's worm territory.

715
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:36,699
Dust cloud.

716
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:38,743
I see it.

717
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,246
That's one of your harvesters.

718
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,440
You can see the spice

719
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,649
scattered over the surface.

720
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,236
A rich spice bed

721
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,197
by the color.

722
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,699
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

723
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,175
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

724
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,220
Wormsign?

725
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,722
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

726
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,308
Worms travel deep but get closer

727
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,643
to the surface when they attack.

728
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,937
If you are patient,

729
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,314
we should see one.

730
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:52,399
A worm always comes?

731
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,152
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

732
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:57,279
Why don't we just
shield the crawlers?

733
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,907
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

734
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,534
It attracts the worms

735
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,911
and drives them into a killing frenzy.

736
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:07,790
Is that a worm?

737
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,303
Big one.

738
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,264
You have good eyes.

739
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,559
Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner.

740
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,561
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

741
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,564
Who calls Delta Ajax niner?

742
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,065
Over.

743
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,608
They seem pretty calm about it.

744
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:35,901
Unlisted flight.

745
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,194
Imperium business.

746
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,363
Wormsign north and east of you.

747
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:41,156
3.7 kilometers.

748
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,075
Delta Ajax niner,

749
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,994
this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.

750
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,247
Stand by for contact fix.

751
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,795
Worm is on intercept course
to your position.

752
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:56,463
Contact in five minutes.

753
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,215
So, what happens now?

754
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,634
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

755
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,178
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

756
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,930
Calling carryall Alpha Zero.

757
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:06,557
Ready for docking sequence.

758
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:09,101
Contact five minutes. Over.

759
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:15,858
Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?

760
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:21,447
There it is.

761
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,073
This is carryall Alpha Zero

762
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:24,491
to Delta Ajax niner.

763
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:27,161
Approaching from your east.

764
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:30,706
Correcting altitude
and preparing docking equipment.

765
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:33,751
Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

766
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,588
T-5.

767
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:38,756
Copy that.

768
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:40,382
Prepare to be airborne
in 30 seconds.

769
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,135
Docking sequence initiated.
Brace yourselves.

770
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,682
Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.

771
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,267
What is going on?

772
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,269
It's one of the anchors.
It's dead.

773
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:54,521
Shit.

774
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,107
Carryall unable to proceed.

775
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,943
Unable to lift without that anchor.

776
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,819
All call! All call!

777
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,405
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!

778
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:05,908
Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.

779
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:06,951
Hydraulics are dead.

780
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,118
We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.

781
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,244
Contact in four minutes.

782
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:10,329
Try it again!

783
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:11,455
How many men on that crawler?

784
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:12,831
Crew of 21.

785
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,500
Our ships can take six each.

786
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:15,709
That's still three short.

787
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,461
We'll find a way.

788
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,600
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

789
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:35,437
We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

790
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,064
We'll set down on the west.

791
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:50,035
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

792
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:51,829
Yes, Gurney,

793
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,580
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

794
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,873
Yes, sire.

795
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,792
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

796
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:57,960
Guide them in.

797
01:03:58,127 --> 01:03:59,420
Delta Ajax niner,

798
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,755
put seven men each in my ships now.

799
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,774
Contact in two minutes.

800
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,904
Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.

801
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:10,574
Where are they?

802
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,077
Sir, there's protocol
for a reason.

803
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,454
If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.

804
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,664
Besides, we've got a full load of spice.

805
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:19,416
- We can't just leave it.
- Damn the spice!

806
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,127
I want every man off that crawler now!

807
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:37,142
Hey!

808
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:38,435
Hey!

809
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,646
Seven over here, seven over there.

810
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,983
Go! Go! Go!

811
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:03,085
Kwisatz Haderach.

812
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:19,977
Kwisatz Haderach awakes.

813
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,821
Hurry! Get on!

814
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:40,664
It's here!

815
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:44,710
Paul!

816
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,213
Paul!

817
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:55,470
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

818
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,347
Get up!

819
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,057
Let's go!

820
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,644
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

821
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,271
Run!

822
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:31,340
Hey!

823
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,401
Bless the Maker and His Water.

824
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,446
Bless the coming and going of Him.

825
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:57,074
May His passage cleanse the world

826
01:07:57,783 --> 01:07:59,660
and keep the world for His people.

827
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:24,935
Hey!

828
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,437
- You cannot take such risks.
-  Yes, sir.

829
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:28,522
You have responsibilities.

830
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:29,898
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

831
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:30,899
Go.

832
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:32,818
Dr. Kynes.

833
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,196
You saw it.

834
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,699
With your own eyes. It's plain to see.

835
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,951
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

836
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:42,494
We've been set up to fail.

837
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,163
That carryall was just old.

838
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:48,292
The desert isn't kind to equipment.

839
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,420
You know what will happen

840
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,964
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

841
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:59,177
I'm not here to take your part.

842
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:03,849
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

843
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:10,439
Take good care of your family.

844
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,236
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

845
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,881
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.

846
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:39,384
You seem to be sensitive.

847
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:44,848
You'll be fine.

848
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,226
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

849
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,072
That wasn't an allergic reaction.

850
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:03,700
I had a vision.

851
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,246
My eyes were wide open.

852
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,333
What did you see?

853
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:52,499
Kwisatz Haderach.

854
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,252
You can see.

855
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,753
It's confusing.

856
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:40,338
I thought I saw my death,

857
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:41,798
only it wasn't.

858
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:46,428
I know a knife is important, somehow.

859
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,807
Someone will hand me a blade,

860
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,686
but I don't know who,
or when, or where.

861
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:59,941
Some things, though, are crystal clear.

862
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,067
I can feel it.

863
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,449
I know you're pregnant.

864
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:14,956
You can't know that.

865
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,084
I barely know that.

866
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,836
It's only been a few weeks.

867
01:13:11,346 --> 01:13:12,556
Atreides legions

868
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,140
are the finest in the Imperium.

869
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,477
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

870
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,237
Just so.

871
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:29,656
Three battalions.

872
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,074
As agreed.

873
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:13,700
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

874
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,076
No.

875
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:17,287
Don't think I want to know.

876
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:20,290
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

877
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,750
he hasn't been the same.

878
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,045
He's distracted.

879
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:29,966
Jessica, you gave me a son.

880
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,760
And from the moment he was born,

881
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,637
I never questioned you.

882
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,513
I trusted you completely.

883
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,183
Even when you walked in shadows.

884
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,436
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

885
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,565
If anything happens...

886
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,818
will you protect our son?

887
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:52,155
With my life.

888
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,449
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

889
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,288
Will you protect Paul?

890
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,421
Why are you having these thoughts?

891
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,097
Leto, this is not you.

892
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:24,938
I thought we'd have more time.

893
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,501
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

894
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:48,795
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

895
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,889
You need to sleep.

896
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:02,767
No.

897
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,185
Not like that.

898
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,536
I should have married you.

899
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:41,825
Hawat. Security.

900
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:45,578
Security.

901
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:50,143
Sir. Sir.

902
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:52,729
The shield's come down.

903
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:03,323
God in heaven.

904
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,492
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

905
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:52,330
Go! Go! Go!

906
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,811
With me! With me!

907
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:26,966
Atreides!

908
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:28,176
Atreides!

909
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,207
-  Sardaukar!
-  Sardaukar!

910
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:23,898
I'm sorry, my lord.

911
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:29,403
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

912
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:33,533
Why?

913
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,868
I had no choice.

914
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,830
The Harkonnens have my wife, Wanna.

915
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,792
They take her apart like a doll.

916
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:45,461
I will buy her freedom.

917
01:22:46,254 --> 01:22:47,338
And you are the price.

918
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:54,053
For Paul. I will do what I can.

919
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,180
And you

920
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:58,099
will kill a man for me.

921
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,274
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

922
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:10,236
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

923
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,408
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

924
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,994
It will be your last breath.

925
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:20,830
But if you choose your moment well,

926
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,208
it will also be the Baron's.

927
01:24:58,469 --> 01:24:59,553
Paul.

928
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,637
To hell, dogs!

929
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,735
I've never had a highborn.

930
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:05,614
You?

931
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:07,658
Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn.

932
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,661
She's highborn
enough for me.

933
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,998
Let's feed the kid to the worms.

934
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,292
And give her a long goodbye.

935
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:18,419
Don't you dare touch my mother.

936
01:28:19,837 --> 01:28:20,796
Don't talk.

937
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:33,809
Remove her gag.

938
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:44,361
Shut up.

939
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:14,934
Remove her gag.

940
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,191
Kill him.

941
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:32,326
Set us free.

942
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:46,924
Stop!

943
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:48,759
Cut the rope.

944
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:52,638
Give me the knife.

945
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,483
Your pitch was too forced.

946
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:13,993
It's a fremkit.

947
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,382
They've crippled the ship.

948
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:41,872
Mmm.

949
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:01,850
Ah.

950
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,271
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

951
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,000
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

952
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:30,129
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

953
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:32,464
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

954
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,633
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

955
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,059
My lord Baron.

956
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:46,645
Dr. Yueh.

957
01:32:46,812 --> 01:32:47,980
The traitor.

958
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,733
What do you want?

959
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:53,444
I jammed their comms

960
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:55,863
and lowered their shields.

961
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:57,406
Hmm.

962
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,616
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

963
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,785
The bargain to the letter.

964
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:03,829
And what was I to do for you?

965
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,332
Deliver my wife from her agony.

966
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,335
Yes.

967
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:45,496
I said I'd set her free.

968
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,831
That you could join her.

969
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:53,837
So, join her.

970
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,057
What do you think is next?

971
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,646
It's a thumper.

972
01:34:11,605 --> 01:34:12,689
No stillsuits.

973
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:14,942
The one thing we actually need.

974
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:23,158
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

975
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:25,869
But no more.

976
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:31,124
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

977
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,753
Tonight the House of Atreides falls.

978
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:40,175
And your bloodline ends forever.

979
01:34:54,231 --> 01:34:55,232
What did you say?

980
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,618
Here I am...

981
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:09,580
here I remain.

982
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:53,976
Kynes!

983
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:57,354
It's not safe for you here.

984
01:36:57,521 --> 01:36:58,647
Will you tell
the Great Houses

985
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,232
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

986
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:02,317
How the best of them were murdered?

987
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,320
I am commanded to say nothing.

988
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:08,240
To see nothing.

989
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,077
The Emperor sent us here to die.

990
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:02,544
There's spice in the tent.

991
01:39:29,256 --> 01:39:31,133
That's the future. It's coming.

992
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,567
Holy war spreading across the universe

993
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:50,026
like unquenchable fire.

994
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:04,916
Paul, you're scared. I can see it.

995
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:07,669
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

996
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:20,223
Somebody help me, please.

997
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:22,434
Paul.

998
01:40:24,728 --> 01:40:25,729
It's coming.

999
01:40:26,605 --> 01:40:28,064
I see a holy war spreading

1000
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:29,816
across the universe
like unquenchable fire.

1001
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:33,069
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1002
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:34,279
in my father's name.

1003
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:35,363
Paul.

1004
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,990
Fanatical legions worshipping

1005
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,909
at the shrine of my father's skull.

1006
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,995
A war in my name!

1007
01:40:42,829 --> 01:40:44,456
Everyone's shouting my name!

1008
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:45,582
Paul.

1009
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,629
Paul Atreides.

1010
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:54,424
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1011
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:57,052
You are the Duke Paul Atreides.

1012
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,972
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1013
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,057
Get off me!

1014
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:05,477
You did this to me!

1015
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:08,104
You Bene Gesserit made me a freak!

1016
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:35,048
My father is dead.

1017
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,837
Someone's near.

1018
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:16,256
You need to drink.

1019
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,884
It's recycled water from the tent.

1020
01:42:28,143 --> 01:42:29,477
Sweat and tears.

1021
01:42:33,523 --> 01:42:34,858
All right, let's get out of here.

1022
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:49,808
That's Duncan.

1023
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:01,486
My lady.

1024
01:44:01,653 --> 01:44:02,654
Paul.

1025
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,198
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1026
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:06,699
We know.

1027
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:09,911
My lord Duke.

1028
01:44:23,508 --> 01:44:24,509
Here.

1029
01:44:26,636 --> 01:44:27,720
Drink this.

1030
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,313
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1031
01:44:37,397 --> 01:44:38,731
on the planet at once.

1032
01:44:39,149 --> 01:44:41,568
There must have been
ten legions, hundreds of ships.

1033
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:42,986
There were Sardaukar with them.

1034
01:44:43,862 --> 01:44:45,780
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1035
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:48,116
You cross swords with a Sardaukar,

1036
01:44:49,117 --> 01:44:50,118
you know it.

1037
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:53,663
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

1038
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:57,167
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1039
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,753
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1040
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,672
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1041
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:24,527
Storm's coming.

1042
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,960
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1043
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:42,212
We'll be safe here.

1044
01:45:43,922 --> 01:45:45,507
Do you know what this place is?

1045
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,510
It's an old ecological testing station.

1046
01:45:52,055 --> 01:45:53,806
They were meant to tame the planet.

1047
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,892
Free the water locked beneath the sands.

1048
01:45:59,479 --> 01:46:01,397
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

1049
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:04,943
The work had begun,
but then the spice was discovered.

1050
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:07,320
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1051
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:08,988
Tanat,

1052
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:10,907
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1053
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,116
Yes, Liet.

1054
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,660
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1055
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:14,994
Of course, Liet.

1056
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:18,498
- Who are you to the Fremen?

1057
01:47:09,716 --> 01:47:11,175
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1058
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:12,343
Dr. Kynes?

1059
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:16,097
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1060
01:47:17,599 --> 01:47:18,725
The Sardaukar coming

1061
01:47:18,808 --> 01:47:20,226
and picking them off
one by one.

1062
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,148
Only together
can they stand a chance

1063
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:26,274
against the Imperium.

1064
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,028
Would you bear witness?

1065
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:33,364
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1066
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,075
If they believe me,

1067
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:38,995
there would be general warfare

1068
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:41,080
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1069
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:42,373
Chaos

1070
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:44,292
across the Imperium.

1071
01:47:44,584 --> 01:47:46,002
Suppose I presented the Emperor

1072
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:47,337
with an alternative to chaos.

1073
01:47:48,588 --> 01:47:50,131
The Emperor has no sons.

1074
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,091
And his daughters have yet to marry.

1075
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:54,677
You'd make a play for the throne?

1076
01:47:55,637 --> 01:47:57,388
The Emperor feared the Atreides.

1077
01:47:57,472 --> 01:47:58,973
He brought you here to kill you.

1078
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,725
What don't you understand?

1079
01:48:01,726 --> 01:48:04,395
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1080
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:11,694
The Fremen speak
of the Lisan al-Gaib.

1081
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:13,946
Careful.

1082
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:17,533
The Voice from the Outer World
who will lead them to paradise.

1083
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:20,578
Superstition.

1084
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,210
I know you loved a Fremen warrior

1085
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:28,503
and lost him in battle.

1086
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:35,134
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1087
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,225
I've seen your dream.

1088
01:48:46,896 --> 01:48:47,980
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1089
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:49,982
I could make a paradise of Arrakis

1090
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:51,317
with a wave of my hand.

1091
01:50:47,517 --> 01:50:48,476
Sardaukar!

1092
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:52,855
No! Duncan!

1093
01:50:53,022 --> 01:50:54,148
Paul, no!

1094
01:50:54,315 --> 01:50:55,566
-  Duncan, no!
-  No!

1095
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:58,027
-  No!
-  Paul, no!

1096
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:00,446
Duncan, no!

1097
01:51:00,822 --> 01:51:03,074
- He's locked the door.
-  Duncan! No!

1098
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:53,249
He's gone.

1099
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,001
Duncan!

1100
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:56,627
We have to go. We have no choice.

1101
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,387
Paul, go! Paul!

1102
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,283
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1103
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:00,066
Follow the light.

1104
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:02,234
You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

1105
01:53:02,818 --> 01:53:04,612
That storm out there is your best shot.

1106
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:07,365
Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust.

1107
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:11,327
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1108
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:12,620
Are you not coming with us?

1109
01:53:12,912 --> 01:53:13,955
It only seats two.

1110
01:53:14,205 --> 01:53:15,665
I'll go to the next station

1111
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:17,625
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1112
01:53:17,792 --> 01:53:19,001
How?

1113
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:20,878
I'm Fremen.

1114
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:23,089
The desert's my home.

1115
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:25,091
Good luck.

1116
01:53:25,257 --> 01:53:26,217
Good luck.

1117
01:56:07,545 --> 01:56:09,463
I serve only one master.

1118
01:56:10,297 --> 01:56:13,092
His name is Shai-Hulud.

1119
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:59,889
There are jet flares behind us.

1120
01:57:34,131 --> 01:57:35,883
Paul. We're not high enough!

1121
01:58:08,374 --> 01:58:09,458
I must not fear.

1122
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:11,210
Fear is the mind-killer.

1123
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:14,797
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1124
01:58:21,095 --> 01:58:23,597
See the friend.

1125
01:58:28,018 --> 01:58:30,062
See the friend.

1126
01:58:33,565 --> 01:58:35,985
The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...

1127
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:41,365
but a reality to experience.

1128
01:58:45,411 --> 01:58:46,954
A process that cannot
be understood

1129
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:48,247
by stopping it.

1130
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:51,750
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1131
01:58:53,335 --> 01:58:54,503
We must join it.

1132
01:58:55,921 --> 01:58:56,922
We must flow with it.

1133
01:58:57,423 --> 01:58:58,674
Let go.

1134
01:58:59,008 --> 01:59:00,342
Let go.

1135
01:59:48,432 --> 01:59:51,727
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1136
01:59:53,729 --> 01:59:55,814
Winds at 800 kilometers an hour.

1137
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:02,654
Nothing survives such a storm.

1138
02:00:03,364 --> 02:00:04,281
They're dead.

1139
02:00:06,241 --> 02:00:07,326
It's a certainty.

1140
02:00:15,042 --> 02:00:16,752
So, it's done. Finally.

1141
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:21,131
Send word to Giedi Prime

1142
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:23,592
to begin selling our spice reserves.

1143
02:00:25,177 --> 02:00:26,136
But slowly.

1144
02:00:27,513 --> 02:00:28,972
We don't want the price to fall.

1145
02:00:30,099 --> 02:00:31,475
You have no idea how much it cost me

1146
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:33,352
to bring such a force to bear here.

1147
02:00:34,395 --> 02:00:36,063
Now I only have one requirement.

1148
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:38,273
Income.

1149
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:40,692
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1150
02:00:41,819 --> 02:00:42,986
Squeeze hard.

1151
02:00:43,362 --> 02:00:44,405
Yes, Uncle.

1152
02:00:46,323 --> 02:00:47,408
And the Fremen?

1153
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:49,660
Kill them all.

1154
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,726
We're above 5,000 meters.

1155
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:54,701
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1156
02:04:47,814 --> 02:04:49,024
And breathe through this.

1157
02:05:20,055 --> 02:05:21,640
Now we have to find the Fremen.

1158
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,768
Are you good?

1159
02:05:24,935 --> 02:05:25,852
Yeah.

1160
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:34,504
Paul...

1161
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:44,222
Don't be frightened.

1162
02:06:45,849 --> 02:06:48,518
Even a little
desert mouse can survive.

1163
02:06:49,644 --> 02:06:52,856
Don't be frightened.

1164
02:06:53,273 --> 02:06:54,649
You'll need to face your fears.

1165
02:06:55,025 --> 02:06:56,234
A friend...

1166
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:59,404
A friend will help you.

1167
02:07:01,364 --> 02:07:02,741
Follow the friend.

1168
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:07,120
You have much to learn.

1169
02:07:09,581 --> 02:07:11,416
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1170
02:07:15,462 --> 02:07:16,546
Come with me.

1171
02:07:45,033 --> 02:07:47,327
The sietch where Duncan lived

1172
02:07:48,703 --> 02:07:49,871
is somewhere off that way.

1173
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:54,793
I can see
greenery over there.

1174
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:56,920
There.

1175
02:07:57,087 --> 02:07:58,421
That means Fremen live there.

1176
02:08:03,677 --> 02:08:04,886
We'll cross after dark.

1177
02:08:05,971 --> 02:08:07,097
That's how the Fremen do it.

1178
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,686
We're about to enter
worm territory.

1179
02:08:13,562 --> 02:08:15,146
We can't walk like regular humans.

1180
02:08:15,522 --> 02:08:16,481
If we do, we're dead.

1181
02:08:16,982 --> 02:08:18,483
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do.

1182
02:08:18,859 --> 02:08:20,068
It's called a sandwalk.

1183
02:08:20,652 --> 02:08:22,487
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

1184
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:24,573
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1185
02:08:24,739 --> 02:08:26,032
Okay. Follow me.

1186
02:08:26,366 --> 02:08:27,617
Do the same moves.

1187
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:42,841
I think this is the right direction.

1188
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:06,508
It's close by.

1189
02:10:07,467 --> 02:10:08,677
Let's get out of here.

1190
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,846
- Wait.

1191
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:15,016
- It's drum sand.

1192
02:10:19,688 --> 02:10:20,814
-  Run.

1193
02:10:27,612 --> 02:10:28,905
Go! Go!

1194
02:11:41,144 --> 02:11:42,187
It's a thumper.

1195
02:11:47,859 --> 02:11:49,152
Someone set off a thumper.

1196
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:06,127
Paul! Run!

1197
02:12:21,226 --> 02:12:22,185
How big are they?

1198
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:23,520
That was insane.

1199
02:12:28,566 --> 02:12:29,484
Someone called it.

1200
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:03,601
Do not run.

1201
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:07,355
You will only waste
your body's water.

1202
02:13:08,523 --> 02:13:09,399
Hold.

1203
02:13:17,198 --> 02:13:18,199
Stilgar.

1204
02:13:18,283 --> 02:13:19,284
- Hey!

1205
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:21,244
You know me. I was there

1206
02:13:21,327 --> 02:13:22,537
when you came
to my father's Council.

1207
02:13:22,829 --> 02:13:23,705
Oh.

1208
02:13:23,997 --> 02:13:25,540
This is the Duke's son.

1209
02:13:26,207 --> 02:13:27,208
Why are you waiting?

1210
02:13:27,959 --> 02:13:29,043
We need their water.

1211
02:13:30,003 --> 02:13:31,713
This is the boy
I told you about.

1212
02:13:32,255 --> 02:13:33,423
We can't touch him.

1213
02:13:37,969 --> 02:13:39,137
They are weaklings.

1214
02:13:39,304 --> 02:13:40,138
Jamis.

1215
02:13:41,222 --> 02:13:43,099
That was a brave crossing they made

1216
02:13:43,183 --> 02:13:44,809
in the path of Shai-Hulud.

1217
02:13:46,186 --> 02:13:48,563
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1218
02:13:50,273 --> 02:13:51,482
Nor did his father.

1219
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:53,443
My thumper saved his life.

1220
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:56,487
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1221
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,323
He's not The One.

1222
02:14:01,743 --> 02:14:03,036
We have powerful friends.

1223
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:06,247
You help us off-world, to Caladan,

1224
02:14:06,831 --> 02:14:08,041
you will be well rewarded.

1225
02:14:08,208 --> 02:14:10,585
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1226
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,045
in your flesh?

1227
02:14:15,298 --> 02:14:16,382
Hmm...

1228
02:14:17,425 --> 02:14:18,551
The boy is young.

1229
02:14:19,177 --> 02:14:20,678
He can learn our ways.

1230
02:14:21,471 --> 02:14:22,805
He may have sanctuary.

1231
02:14:24,224 --> 02:14:26,434
But the woman is untrained...

1232
02:14:29,187 --> 02:14:30,521
and too old to learn.

1233
02:15:01,970 --> 02:15:03,888
-  Back, you dogs.

1234
02:15:05,598 --> 02:15:06,766
She'll cut my throat.

1235
02:15:12,897 --> 02:15:15,149
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1236
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:16,567
And a fighter?

1237
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:18,569
Conversation ran short.

1238
02:15:19,362 --> 02:15:20,947
Peace, woman.

1239
02:15:21,572 --> 02:15:22,699
Peace.

1240
02:15:23,741 --> 02:15:25,243
I judged hastily.

1241
02:16:04,949 --> 02:16:06,868
I would not
have let you hurt my friends.

1242
02:16:32,393 --> 02:16:33,728
They say you're the Mahdi.

1243
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,647
But you look like a little boy.

1244
02:16:38,274 --> 02:16:39,567
You chose the hardest way up.

1245
02:16:39,901 --> 02:16:40,777
Follow me.

1246
02:16:48,576 --> 02:16:49,744
Give it to me.

1247
02:16:57,377 --> 02:16:58,795
You will have your own maula pistol

1248
02:16:58,878 --> 02:17:00,088
when you've earned it.

1249
02:17:00,963 --> 02:17:01,964
Give it to me.

1250
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:09,806
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.

1251
02:17:10,181 --> 02:17:12,225
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1252
02:17:12,642 --> 02:17:13,851
I will not have them.

1253
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:21,901
Jamis,

1254
02:17:22,568 --> 02:17:24,612
I have spoken. Be still.

1255
02:17:24,904 --> 02:17:26,364
You talk like a leader.

1256
02:17:27,782 --> 02:17:29,242
But the strongest leads.

1257
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:32,036
She bested you.

1258
02:17:33,955 --> 02:17:35,164
I invoke the amtal.

1259
02:17:36,332 --> 02:17:38,626
You may not challenge
a Sayyadina.

1260
02:17:38,793 --> 02:17:40,044
Then who will fight in her name?

1261
02:17:40,586 --> 02:17:42,380
Jamis, don't do this.

1262
02:17:43,297 --> 02:17:45,216
Don't. The night is fading.

1263
02:17:45,383 --> 02:17:47,927
Then the sun will witness this death.

1264
02:17:48,594 --> 02:17:49,846
Where is her champion?

1265
02:18:01,357 --> 02:18:02,733
I accept her champion.

1266
02:18:35,433 --> 02:18:38,186
Paul Atreides must die...

1267
02:18:41,105 --> 02:18:45,568
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

1268
02:18:48,529 --> 02:18:51,324
Don't be frightened.

1269
02:18:52,325 --> 02:18:53,701
Don't resist.

1270
02:18:59,999 --> 02:19:01,959
When you take a life,

1271
02:19:03,002 --> 02:19:04,754
you take your own.

1272
02:19:36,702 --> 02:19:38,371
I don't believe
you're the Lisan al-Gaib.

1273
02:19:40,623 --> 02:19:42,166
But I want you to die with honor.

1274
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:56,514
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1275
02:20:00,226 --> 02:20:02,061
It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud.

1276
02:20:02,687 --> 02:20:03,813
The great sandworm.

1277
02:20:06,023 --> 02:20:08,109
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1278
02:20:13,239 --> 02:20:14,824
Where is the Outworlder?

1279
02:20:19,745 --> 02:20:21,080
Jamis is a good fighter.

1280
02:20:22,707 --> 02:20:23,749
He won't let you suffer.

1281
02:20:25,793 --> 02:20:26,877
Chani...

1282
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:31,173
Um...

1283
02:20:39,557 --> 02:20:40,433
Never mind.

1284
02:21:36,614 --> 02:21:37,907
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1285
02:21:46,248 --> 02:21:47,708
You should welcome my blade.

1286
02:21:51,629 --> 02:21:52,963
This world will kill you.

1287
02:21:56,717 --> 02:21:57,885
Quicker this way.

1288
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:39,635
- Do you yield?

1289
02:22:42,012 --> 02:22:43,639
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1290
02:22:44,807 --> 02:22:46,642
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1291
02:22:46,809 --> 02:22:48,310
Only death is the test of it.

1292
02:22:56,902 --> 02:22:58,612
- Is he toying with him?
- No.

1293
02:23:00,448 --> 02:23:01,449
Paul has never killed a man.

1294
02:23:12,543 --> 02:23:16,505
Kwisatz Haderach.

1295
02:23:19,967 --> 02:23:22,762
Kwisatz Haderach.

1296
02:23:23,137 --> 02:23:26,932
Climb up. Rise.

1297
02:25:19,837 --> 02:25:21,130
You're one of us now.

1298
02:25:21,714 --> 02:25:22,965
A life for a life.

1299
02:25:23,716 --> 02:25:25,259
Come with us to Sietch Tabr.

1300
02:25:25,509 --> 02:25:26,385
No.

1301
02:25:26,802 --> 02:25:27,970
Paul needs to get off-world.

1302
02:25:28,345 --> 02:25:30,264
You must have ways. You have smugglers,

1303
02:25:30,347 --> 02:25:31,390
you have ships.

1304
02:25:31,599 --> 02:25:32,766
-  No.
-  You have...

1305
02:25:33,934 --> 02:25:35,603
The Emperor sent us to this place.

1306
02:25:37,563 --> 02:25:38,772
And my father came,

1307
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,400
not for spice,

1308
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:43,611
not for the riches,

1309
02:25:45,029 --> 02:25:46,488
but for the strength of your people.

1310
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:51,660
My road leads into the desert.

1311
02:25:54,914 --> 02:25:55,873
I can see it.

1312
02:25:58,626 --> 02:25:59,793
If you'll have us,

1313
02:26:01,337 --> 02:26:02,338
we will come.

1314
02:26:51,637 --> 02:26:52,638
Desert power.

1315
02:26:54,390 --> 02:26:55,641
This is only the beginning.
