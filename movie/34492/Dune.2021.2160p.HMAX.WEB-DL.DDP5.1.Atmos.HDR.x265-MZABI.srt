1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,840
梦境是灵魂深处的投影

2
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,500
沙   丘

3
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,500
第 一 章

4
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,980
年

5
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,100
卡拉丹

6
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,100
厄崔迪斯家族母星

7
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,000
杰 迪 主 星

8
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,000
哈 柯 南 家 族 母 星

9
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:30,850
萨 鲁 萨 . 赛 康 达 斯

10
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:30,850
皇 室 驻 军 行 星

11
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:30,720


12
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
本尼.洁瑟里特的事儿 我是略有所闻

13
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,500
她们说她们的存在 是为了要造福更多的人

14
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,880
并不是要冒犯您的母亲

15
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,120
但说到底 她们做的一切 都是为了她们自己人

16
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
你什么意思?

17
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,800
当心点

18
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:08,690


19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,600
我的母星 厄拉科斯 日落时瑰丽无比
My planet, arrakis, is so beautiful when the sun is low.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
沙雾弥漫
Rolling over the sands…

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
香料在空中闪烁
you can see spice in the air.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,120
待到夜幕降临 香料采集者登场
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,120
这些外来者刻意避开了白昼的酷热
The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,520
他们当着我们的面肆虐我们的土地
They ravage our lands in front of our eyes.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,040
他们出了名的残暴嗜杀
Their cruelty to my people is all I've known.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,040
在我还没出生之前 这些哈柯南家族的外来者就来了这里
These outsiders, the harkonnens,came long before I was born.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,680
他们控制了这里的香料产业 籍此发家致富
By controlling the spice production they became obscenely rich.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,400
直至富可敌国
Richer than the emperor himself.

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,880
我们的战士一败涂地 失去了厄拉科斯
Our warriors couldn't free arrakis from the harkonnens,

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,080
突然有一天 皇帝下令让他们撤离
but one day, by imperial decree,they were gone.

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,720
他为什么要这么做? 谁又是下一任酷吏?
Why did the emperor choose this path? And who our next oppressors be?

32
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,480
还好你起得早
It's good you're up early.

33
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,960
你父亲要你在皇使到来之前穿上礼服
Father wants you in full dress before the emperor's herald arrives.

34
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,640
穿礼服? 军礼服吗?
Full dress? Military?

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
常礼服
Ceremonial.

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,720
既然事情都定下了 还走这形式干嘛?
Why do we have to go through all of this when it's already been decided?

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
这是规矩
Ceremony.

38
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
谢谢
Thank you.

39
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,840
想要的话 就使用真言术
If you want it make me give it to you.

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,520
-用真言指令  -妈,我还没睡醒呢
- Use the voice. - Mom, I just woke up.

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
-给我水  -杯子可不会听人话 命令我
- Give me the water. - The glass can't hear you. Command me.

42
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,560
【给我水】
Give me the water.

43
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,160
-差点意思  -还差?
- Almost. - Almost?

44
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,720
本尼.洁瑟里特学院的这些技能够你学几年的 保罗
Bene gesserit skills take years to learn, Paul.

45
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,200
你看起来有点累啊 做梦了?
You look tired. More dreams?

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,280
没有
No.

47
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,240
极端的温度和天气变化
Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events

48
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,840
让厄拉科斯旷野的环境分外恶劣
make life outside the cities  of arrakis truly hostile.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,480
那里的沙尘暴甚至能穿透钢板
With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through the metal.

50
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,080
只有被称为弗雷曼人(自由民)的土著部落能适应并生存下来
Only the native tribes known as the fremen  have adapted well enough to survive.

51
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,960
他们喜好居住在厄拉科斯最偏远的地区
Preferring to inhabit the remotest regions of arrakis

52
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,480
弗雷曼人与被他们叫做"沙葫芦"的巨大沙虫
the fremen share the deep desert  with the giant sandworms

53
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,520
共享着这片茫茫大漠
known to the fremen as shai hulud.

54
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,960
长期接触香料赋予了他们特有的蓝色眼瞳
Long exposure to spice has given  the tribe their characteristic blue eyes,

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
称为"伊巴德之眼"
the eyes of ibad.

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,720
他们危险且不可靠
Little else is known of the fremen

57
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,800
除此之外我们对他们一无所知
except that they are dangerous  and unreliable.

58
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,640
弗雷曼人的袭击使得香料采集十分危险
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting  extremely hazardous.

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,120
于弗雷曼人 香料是他们的神圣幻剂
For the fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen

60
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,800
可以强身健体 益寿延年
which preserves life and brings  enormous health benefits.

61
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,760
于帝国 香料是宇航公会的领航员们
For the imperium, the spice is used  by the navigators of the spacing guild

62
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,520
用于穿梭星际 识别安全路径的明灯
to find safe paths between the stars.

63
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,680
没有香料 宇宙航行就会举步维艰
Without spice  interstellar travel is impossible,

64
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,000
这也使得香料 成为了宇宙中最珍贵的物质
making it by far the most valuable  substance in the universe.

65
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
笑一笑 格尼
Smile gurney.

66
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,280
笑着呢
I am smiling.

67
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,600
他们这一趟大老远跑来宣旨得花多少钱?
How much will it cost them traveling  all this way for this formality?

68
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,080
三个领航员 往返总计14600062个宇宙币(帝国官方货币)
Three guild navigators and a total  of 1,460,062 solaris for the round trip.

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,760
奉 天承运皇帝沙达姆・科里诺四世
By the grace of shaddam iv of the house corrino,

70
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,360
已知宇宙内金狮王座的拥有者 帕迪沙君皇
ascendant to the golden lion throne  of padishah emperor of the known universe,

71
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,600
以改革先驱者的姿态
I stand before you as herald of the change.

72
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
在朝中众爱卿和
We are witnessed by members of the imperial court,

73
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,680
宇航公会、以及本尼.洁瑟里特姐妹会(学院)的见证之下
representatives of the spacing guild, and a sister of the bene gesserit.

74
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,520
诏曰:
The emperor has spoken:

75
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,410
"着厄崔迪斯家族即刻承接厄拉科斯
"House atreides shall immediately take control of arrakis

76
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
的一应事务"
and serve as its steward."

77
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,520
是否领旨?
Do you accept?

78
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,880
我们是厄崔迪斯家族
We are the house atreides.

79
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,520
使命必达、不负皇天
There is no call we do not answer.  There is no faith that we betray.

80
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,320
皇上要我们为厄拉科斯带去和平
The emperor asks us to bring peace to arrakis.

81
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
厄崔迪斯家族领旨
House atreides accepts.

82
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,360
厄崔迪斯!
Atreides!

83
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,600
盖印吧
Your seal.

84
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,600
那么 完成了?
So, it's done?

85
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,120
完成了
It's done.

86
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,240
-如何? -稳定器松得很
- How was it?  - The stabilizers are too loose.

87
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,720
-我来搞定  -谢谢 我的朋友 -没问题
-I'll handle that.  -Thank you, my friend. -Got it

88
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
-邓肯  -好小子!
- Duncan.  - My boy!

89
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,400
保罗 好小子
Paul, my boy.

90
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,520
你明天是要和先遣队去厄拉科斯吗?
So, you're going to arrakis tomorrow  with the advance team?

91
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
是的 明天和他们出发去厄拉科斯
Yes, I'm going to arrakis tomorrow  with the advance team.

92
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,560
-我想和你一起去 -你吗?
- I'd like you to take me with you.  - You would?

93
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,200
那就太糟了 因为不行
That's too bad, cause no.

94
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,840
邓肯…
Duncan…

95
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,200
你是想送我上军事法庭吗?怎么了?
are you trying to give me court martial?  What's going on?

96
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,960
-我能相信你吗? -必须的 你懂的
- Can I trust you with something?  - Always. You know that.

97
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
我一直在做梦
I've been having dreams.

98
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,680
关于厄拉科斯和弗雷曼人的梦
About arrakis and the fremen.

99
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,600
嗯 然后呢?
Okay, so?

100
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
我看到了你
I saw you.

101
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
和弗雷曼人在一起
With the fremen.

102
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,800
所以我找到他们了? 不错呀 是个好兆头 对吧?
So I do find them? There you go.  That's a good omen right there, right?

103
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
兰维尔!
Lanville!

104
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,840
我看到你死了 战死了
I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle.

105
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
我觉得如果我在哪儿 你就不会死
I felt like if I had been there  you'd be alive.

106
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,270
首先 我不会死
First of, I'm not gonna die.

107
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,470
-我是认真的  -这就是你想跟我一起走的原因?
- You're not taking me seriously.  -That's why you wanna come with me?

108
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,550
听着 梦境发生在梦乡
Listen, dreams make good stories,

109
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,300
而大事总发生于清醒的现实
but everything important happens when we're awake,

110
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,320
梦中那些都是幻觉而已
because that's where  we make things happen.

111
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
-瞧瞧你 练出块儿了没有? -有吗?
- Look at you, put up some muscle?  - I did?

112
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
哪有
No.

113
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,640
厄拉科斯见 好小子
See you in arrakis, my boy.

114
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,730
父亲 我明天想和邓肯・爱达荷一起
Father, I'd like to ask  to join duncan idaho

115
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,720
去厄拉科斯打前站
on a scout mission to arrakis tomorrow.

116
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,440
我学过弗雷曼语 会有用处的
I've studied the fremen language.I'd be an asset.

117
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,640
别想了
Out of the question.

118
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,140
几周之后我们再一块儿去
You'll travel in a few weeks to arrakis like the rest of us.

119
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,070
那我练了那么久又派不上用场 有意义吗
I've been training my whole life…  what is the point if I'm not allowed

120
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,640
你知道意义在哪 保罗 你是我们家族的未来
you know why, Paul.  You're the future of the house atreides.

121
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,840
祖父还下场去斗过牛呢
And grandfather fought bulls for sport.

122
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,200
对啊 你再看看他的下场
Yes, look where that got him.

123
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,560
厄拉科斯危机四伏 到了那儿我需要你陪在我身边
I need you by my side. When we get  to arrakis we'll face enormous danger.

124
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,120
什么危险 弗雷曼人还是沙漠?
What danger? The fremen? The desert?

125
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,320
政治上的风险
Political danger.

126
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,040
各大氏族们对我们家族的仰仗 触碰了皇上的逆鳞
The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the emperor.

127
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,360
指派我们去替换厄拉科斯上的哈柯南家族
By taking arrakis from the harkonnens  and making it ours

128
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,720
这是皇上为削弱两院实力而下的一步妙手
he sets the stage for a war  which would weaken both houses.

129
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,760
可如果我们能站稳脚跟 充分发挥出厄拉科斯的力量
But if we hold firm  and tap the true power of arrakis

130
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,080
我们就能变得比以往更强大
we could be stronger than ever.

131
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,330
然后呢?
What does that mean?

132
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,230
继续霸占矿产、圈禁弗雷曼人吗
Mining spice, keeping  the fremen in their place?

133
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,680
那我们和哈柯南家族有什么分别
We'd be no better than harkonnens.

134
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,520
不 我们会和弗雷曼人结盟
No. By making an alliance with the fremen.

135
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,960
已经安排邓肯.爱达荷去谈了
That's what I've sent  duncan idaho to arrange.

136
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,800
而在这里 在卡拉丹母星 我们拥有海空力量
Here, on caladan, we've ruled  by air power and sea power.

137
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,600
在厄拉科斯 我们需要培养大漠的力量
On arrakis, we need to cultivate  desert power.

138
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
我想让你参加长老会 学习如何理政
I want you sitting in  on my council, learn what I do.

139
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,160
如果我不想呢 父亲
What if I'm not, dad?

140
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,680
不想什么?
Not what?

141
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,160
家族已经定好的未来
The future of the house atreides.

142
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,600
我也曾跟我的父亲这样说过
I told my father I didn't want this either.

143
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,440
-我的理想是当飞行员  -你没跟我说过
- I wanted to be a pilot.  - You never told me that.

144
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,680
你祖父曾说过 "伟人从不强求权柄
Your grandfather said, "a great  man doesn't seek to lead.

145
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,280
权柄自会召唤他"
He's called to it. And he answers."

146
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
如果你的答案是"不想"
And if your answer is "no"

147
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,840
你依然是我属意的唯一人选
you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be,

148
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,280
我的孩子
my son.

149
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,440
我已经找到了自己的路 你也会找到属于你的大道
I found my own way to it. Maybe you'll find yours.

150
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,040
祖先有灵…
In their memory…

151
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
试一下也无妨
give it a try.

152
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
别把后背对着门
Don't stand with your back to the door.

153
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,200
跟你说过多少次了?
How many times do we have to tell you?

154
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,610
听脚步声就知道是你 格尼.哈勒克
I could tell it was you  by your footsteps, gurney halleck.

155
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,630
有人可能会模仿我的脚步声
Someone might imitate my stride.

156
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,190
我听得出来 你是新来的兵器老师吗?
I know the difference.  Are you the new weapons master?

157
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,390
邓肯.爱达荷走了 只好换我来教喽
With duncan idaho gone,  I must make do as best as I can.

158
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,620
去挑刀吧
Choose your blade.

159
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,000
我今天挺不顺的 格尼 唱首歌来听听吧
I've had quite a day, gurney.  Give us a song instead.

160
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,440
真粗鲁
That's rude.

161
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
来吧 来吧
Come on. Come on.

162
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,840
老头子
Old man.

163
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,400
让刀速缓下来 才能破盾
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

164
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,320
-我想我今天没啥心情练刀  -心情? 跟心情有什么关系?
- I'm guessing I'm not in the mood today.  - Mood? What's mood got to do with it?

165
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,880
危险可不会随你的心情而来 战斗吧!
You fight when the necessity arises,  no matter the mood. Now, fight!

166
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
来!
Come on!

167
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,800
-干掉你了  -是啊
- I have you.  - Aye.

168
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,480
低头再瞧瞧 咱z是同归于尽
But look down, my lord.  You'd have joined me in death.

169
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
看来你找到心情了
I see you found the mood.

170
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,440
-真那么糟吗?  -你还不明白吗?
- Will it be that bad?  - You don't get it, do you?

171
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,960
你根本不明白这件事有多严重
You don't really understand the grave  nature of what's happening to us.

172
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,480
八十多年来 厄拉科斯一直隶属哈柯南家族
For 80 years arrakis belonged  to house harkonnen.

173
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,760
采了八十多年的矿 你能想象他们究竟有多富有吗?
Eighty years of owning the spice fields.  Can you imagine the wealth?

174
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,460
从你的眼睛里 我要从你的眼睛里看到
In your eyes, I need  to see it in your eyes.

175
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,490
你以前从没见过哈柯南家的人 我见过
You never met harkonners before. I have.

176
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,960
他们根本毫无人性 残酷无情!
They are not human. They're brutal!

177
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
你必须做好准备
You have to be ready.

178
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,400
男爵大人
Lord baron.

179
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
拉班
Rabban.

180
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,320
我们的最后一艘船已经驶离厄拉科斯了 撤完了
The last of our ships  have left arrakis. It's done.

181
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,920
很好
Very good.

182
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,130
叔叔 怎么能这样?
Uncle, how did we let this happen?

183
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,800
皇上怎么能把我们苦心经营了那么久的一切
How can the emperor  take everything we've built

184
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,080
统统交给了那个公爵 为什么
and give it to that duke? How?

185
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,120
别想太多 那是皇上爱护我们
Don't be too sure, it's an act of love.

186
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,360
那他是什么意思?
What does he mean?

187
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,760
天赐而不得不领 则当受其咎
When is a gift not a gift?

188
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,440
厄崔迪斯家族声望愈隆
The atreides voice is rising

189
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,040
而主上又极善妒
and the emperor is a jealous man.

190
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,400
危险且善妒
A dangerous, jealous man.

191
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,840
保罗…
Paul…

192
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
保罗 醒醒
Paul, wake up.

193
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,920
-怎么了? -穿好衣服跟我来
- What's wrong?  - Get dressed and come with me.

194
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
怎么了?
What is this?

195
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,530
圣母盖乌斯.海伦.莫希阿姆驾到
The reverend mother gaius helen mohiam is here.

196
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,290
她是我在本尼.洁瑟里特学院的老师
She was my teacher at the bene gesserit school.

197
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,020
她现在是皇上本人的真言师
She's now truthsayer  to the emperor himself.

198
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,620
她想见见你

199
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,000

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,430
她想看看你的那些梦

201
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
她怎么知道的?

202
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,960
-岳医生怎么也来了?  -他只呆一小会
- And why is Dr. Yueh here?  - He only needs a moment.

203
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,920
您好 少主
Hello, young master.

204
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,240
您母亲让我检查一下您的身体状况
Your mother asked me to check your vitals.

205
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

206
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,600
他的心脏一如既往地强壮 夫人
His heart is strong as ever, my lady.

207
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
[不得泄密]
Not a word of this to anyone.

208
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,440
保罗…
Paul…

209
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,120
[记住你做过的那些训练]
remember your training.

210
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,720
你是谁?
Who are you?

211
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,740
眼神里满是敌意 和他爹一模一样
Defiance in the eyes, like his father.

212
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,790
下去吧
Leave us.

213
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,840
照海伦.莫希阿姆吩咐的做
You must do everything  the mother helen mohiam tells you.

214
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,960
你就这样在我母亲家里把她呼来喝去
You dismiss my mother in her own house.

215
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,360
【过来 跪下】
Come here. Kneel.

216
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
你竟敢对我用真言术?
How dare you use the voice on me?

217
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,080
把右手放到盒子里去
Put your right hand in the box.

218
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,000
你母亲让你听我的吩咐
Your mother bade you obey me.

219
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,920
你脖子旁边有根戈姆刺 毒刺 见血封喉
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,  a poison needle, instant death.

220
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,340
测试很简单
The test is simple.

221
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,950
把手从盒子里抽出来 你死
Remove your hand  from the box, and you die.

222
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,520
盒子里是什么?
What's in the box?

223
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
疼痛
Pain.

224
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,160
叫卫士也没用
No need to call the guards.

225
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,520
你母亲就站在门后 没她的吩咐谁也进不来
Your mother stands behind that door.  No one will get past her.

226
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

227
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,160
被陷阱困住的野兽会选择断肢逃生
An animal caught in a trap  will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

228
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,120
如果换了是你 会怎么做?
What will you do?

229
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
安静
Silence.

230
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,640
我不能害怕
I must not fear.

231
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,240
我不能害怕
I must not fear.

232
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,200
恐惧是心灵的杀手
Fear is the mind killer.

233
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,720
恐惧是引发彻底毁灭的小小死神
Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.

234
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,050
直面我内心恐惧 让其穿身而过
I will face my fear and I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

235
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,360
当一切逝去…
And when it has gone past…

236
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
再敞开心眼 观其留痕
I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

237
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,800
其烟消云散处
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

238
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,400
唯留本我
Only I will remain.

239
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,160
够了
Enough.

240
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,840
吾等选人似沙里淘金
Like sifting sand through a screen,  we sift people.

241
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,570
若你同禽兽般无法抑制冲动
If you had been unable to control  your impulses like an animal,

242
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,430
还不如将你除掉
we could not have let you live.

243
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,760
你所负传承太过
You inherit too much power.

244
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,720
-就因为我是公爵的儿子吗?  -因为你是洁茜卡的儿子
- What, because I'm a duke's son?  - Because you are Jessica's son.

245
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,560
你生来即非凡俗 孩子
You have more than one birthright,boy.

246
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
洁茜卡
Jessica.

247
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,760
你之前一直在教他道术
You've been training him in a way.

248
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,960
-跟我讲讲你那些梦  -我今晚就做了一个
- Tell me about these dreams.  - I had one tonight.

249
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,080
你看到了什么?
What did you see?

250
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,920
-一个女孩 厄拉科斯星的  -以前梦到过她吗?
- A girl on arrakis.  - Have you dreamt of her before?

251
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,120
很多次了
Many times.

252
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,880
你的那些梦境总会成真吗?
Do you often dream things that happen  just as you dreamt them?

253
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,040
也不全是
Not exactly.

254
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,800
再见 少年 愿你得存活
Goodbye, young human.  I hope you'll live.

255
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,560
一定要这么做吗?
Did you have to go that far?

256
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,120
你违反教条 教他玄秘道术
You chose to train him in the way  in defiance of the rule.

257
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,640
他拥有了我们的力量 就必须接受最严苛的测试
He wields our power.  He had to be tested to the limits.

258
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,010
你把自己的天赋全用在了男人身上
So much potential wasted in the male.

259
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,590
叫你生个女儿
You were told to bear only daughters,

260
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,980
可你却自以为能生出个魁萨茨.哈德拉克(救世主)
kwisatz haderach but you and your pride thought you could produce the kwisatz haderach.

261
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,270
我错了吗?
Was I wrong?

262
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,570
他没死在那间屋子里你就该谢天谢地了
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

263
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,480
就算他是救世主 那也还有很长的路要走
If he is the one he has a long way to go.

264
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,560
他的先知能力尚未觉醒 就被扔到了火堆上炙烤
His sight is barely awakened  and now he goes into the fire.

265
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,960
可我们的计划是以世纪为单位的
But our plans are measured  in centuries.

266
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,970
如果他未竞得成
We have other prospects

267
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,510
备选者还多得是
if he fails his promise.

268
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,760
希望真就如此渺茫吗?
Do you see so little hope?

269
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,880
在厄拉科斯 我们已经尽力了
On arrakis, we have done all we can for you.

270
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,760
前路已经铺就 但要他自己寻求
The path has been laid.  Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

271
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,440
保罗…
Paul…

272
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,080
这是什么意思?
what does it mean?

273
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,080
-我能成救世主?  -你听见了?
- That I can be the one?  - You heard?

274
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,230
学院历来是各大家族的强大伙伴
The bene gesserit serve  as powerful partners to the great houses,

275
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,180
但也有更深层次的原因
but there's more to it.

276
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,160
你们在暗中扰乱帝国政体
You stir the politics  on the imperium from the shadows.

277
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,240
-我知道  -你只知其一
- I know.  - You don't know everything.

278
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,410
数千年以来
For thousands of years,

279
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,300
我们一直在不同血缘之间繁衍 期待诞生出
we've been carefully  crossing bloodlines to bring forth

280
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,000
救世主?
the one?

281
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
一个…
A mind…

282
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:20,080
强大到可以打破时空壁垒 穿越过去未来的…
powerful enough to breach  space and time, past and future…

283
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,600
能帮助我们迈入更美好明天的人
who can help us into a better future.

284
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
我们觉得他已经离我们很近了
We think he's very close now.

285
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,920
还有些人笃信他就在此地
Some believe he is here.

286
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,160
都在你们的计划中
All part of the plan.

287
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
开护盾
Shields.

288
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,680
"我品味到了时间的气息 以及风吹来的沙砾"
"My lungs taste the air of time, blown past falling sands."

289
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,480
杜菲.哈瓦特(门泰特)
Thufir hawat.

290
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,560
小少爷 对新世界感觉如何?
Young master, how does it feel to walk on the new world?

291
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,120
目前来说感觉不错
Exciting, to say the least.

292
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,960
-主上  -还好吗 老朋友
- My lord.  - How are you, old friend?

293
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,250
我的先头部队已经肃清了这座城
My advance team has secured the city.

294
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,110
但还有些麻烦事需要处理
We're still smoothing out a few rough spots.

295
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,600
夫人
My lady.

296
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
里桑.阿尔盖伊布!
Lisan al gaib!Lisan al gaib!

297
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,800
里桑.阿尔盖伊布!
Lisan al gaib !Lisan al gaib!

298
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,520
别被他们的欢迎词给骗了
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

299
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,470
这样做只是遵循旧历 惯性而为
They follow their old master's rules, mandatory attendancy.

300
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,920
哈柯南的人喜欢搞这些表面文章
That's harkonnen love out there.

301
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,680
厄崔迪斯!
Atreides!

302
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,100
我来带你们离开这
Let's get you out of the sun.

303
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,710
这地方热得要命
The heat can kill in this place.

304
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,420
他们刚刚对着我们
They were pointing at us.

305
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,230
在喊什么东西?
What were they shouting?

306
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,510
里桑.阿尔盖伊布 "异域降临的救世主"
Lisan al gaib.  "The voice from the outer world."

307
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,040
就如同我们称呼"弥赛亚"(上帝遣去拯救犹太人的救世主)
It's their name for "Messiah."

308
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,820
这就意味着学院也在这里布下了后手
That means that bene gesserit  have done a work here.

309
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,480
布下迷信吗?
Planting superstitions?

310
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,830
这叫未雨绸缪 保罗
Preparing the way, Paul.

311
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,160
他们盼着里桑.阿尔盖伊布到来已经等了几个世纪
These people have waited  for centuries for the lisan al gaib.

312
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,120
直到他们看到了你 看到了征兆
They see you, they see the signs.

313
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,760
他们看到的只是以讹传讹而已
They see what they've been told to see.

314
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,600
出发了
We're good to go.

315
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,920
盾墙屏蔽场 可保护城市不受恶劣天气和沙虫的侵袭
Shield wall, protects the city  from the weather and the worms.

316
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,680
当地人叫那一大块区域为"上帝之手"
The locals call the big one  the "hand of god."

317
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,360
而上帝之手正破坏着我们的通讯系统
Well, the hand of god is wreaking havoc on our com system.

318
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,920
真安静
It's so quiet.

319
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,680
是啊 这正是我担心的
Yeah. That's what worries me too.

320
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,800
那边是太空港口
There's a space port,

321
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,590
烟尘区域是香料精炼厂
and in that plump of dust  there's a spice refinery.

322
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,000
这是我们最薄弱的两处地点 你得把它们守好了
Our two most vulnerable points.  I want you guarding them.

323
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,040
香料提炼不出来又运不出去的话 我们就死定了
If we can't refine spice and ship it  off to the world, we're dead here.

324
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,520
大人 太阳已经升得很高了 我们得封门了
My lord.The sun is getting too high. We need to seal the doors.

325
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,160
他们是怎么描述这鬼地方来着?
What do they say  about this hell hole again?

326
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,170
"沐浴其中 以沙洗臀"
"It's a shower, you scrub  your ass with sand,"

327
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,740
没错 是这意思
my lord, that's what they say.

328
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,920
就是这么说的
That's what they say.

329
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,240
管家的候选人 夫人
Candidates for a house keeper, my lady.

330
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,720
-你叫什么名字?   -夏道特.梅帕丝 夫人
- What is your name?  - Shadout mapes, my lady.

331
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,920
其他人可以退下了 谢谢你们!
The rest of you may go. Thank you.

332
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,680
夏道特
Shadout.

333
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,560
这是古恰科博萨语
It's an old chakobsa word.

334
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,220
是"染布匠"的意思
"Well dipper."

335
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,250
你是弗雷曼人
You are fremen.

336
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
-你很懂古代语言吗?  -我还知道很多事情
- You know the ancient tongues?  - I know many things.

337
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,800
我知道你的身上藏着件武器
I know that you have a weapon concealed in your bodies.

338
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
[等]
Wait.

339
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,640
若你想伤害我 我得警告你不管你藏着什么东西
If you mean to harm me, I must warn you whatever you're hiding,

340
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,280
都没法得逞
it won't be enough.

341
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,000
这武器是一件礼物
My weapon is meant as a gift

342
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,840
如果你真是救世主的话
if you are truly the one.

343
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,840
知道它是什么吗?
Do you know this?

344
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,760
这是一柄晶刃
It's a crysknife.

345
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
你知道它的涵义吗?
Do you know its meaning?

346
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
[准备好]
Be ready.

347
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,240
这是个制造(死亡的东西)
It's a maker (of death).

348
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,280
大漠的造物主啊(萨亚迪娜)
A maker of the deep desert.

349
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,670
当盘桓在心头的预言真正成为现实的那一刻
When you have lived  with a prophecy for so long

350
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,650
无论是谁都会忍不住激动的情绪
the moment of revelation is a shock.

351
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,760
里桑.阿尔盖伊布 圣母和圣子
Lisan al gaib. The mother and the son.

352
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,200
它属于您了
It is yours.

353
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,960
沙葫芦之齿
Tooth of shai hulud.

354
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,800
你好
Hello.

355
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,240
这种时候不适宜出来闲逛
You shouldn't be out here  at this time of the day.

356
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,400
他们还不是在外面
They are out here.

357
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,280
弗雷曼人的朝圣者 他们可不怕中暑
Fremen pilgrims.  They don't care about heat stroke.

358
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,240
没想到在这里居然还能看见椰枣树
I didn't know date palms  could even be found out here.

359
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,160
它们并非原生树种 没有我的浇灌 它们活不下来
These aren't indigenous.  They can't survive without me.

360
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,360
每棵树浇一次水的量够五个人喝一整天了
Each one of these drinks every day  the equivalent of five man.

361
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,680
二十颗椰枣树 一百人的性命
Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives.

362
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,080
-要节水的话 为何不移除它们呢?  -不,不行
- Should we remove them? Save the water?  - No, no.

363
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,400
这可是圣树
These are sacred.

364
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
承载着古老的梦想
Old dream.

365
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,080
厄拉科斯最大、最危险的生物叫做沙虫
The largest and the most dangerous  organism on arrakis is the sandworm.

366
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,000
其长度可达四百米
Capable of reaching 400 meters in length.

367
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,080
为避免有节奏的声响吸引沙虫的注意
To avoid making rhythmic noises  which attract the sandworms,

368
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,960
弗雷曼人会使用一种模仿沙漠自然声音
the fremen cross desert spaces  using the sand walk,

369
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,830
节奏不规则的舞蹈动作
a dance like motion with irregular rhythm

370
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,700
在沙漠中穿行
which emulates the natural sounds  of the desert.

371
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,080
厄拉科斯存在少量的植物 得益于弗雷曼人的栽培
What scant plant life exists  on arrakis is thanks to the fremen,

372
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,030
他们种植的都是些根系发达的植物
who have cultivated  deep rooted terrain plants,

373
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,080
例如仙人掌、灌木
such as saguaro, burrobush,

374
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,920
沙藤和香树
sand verbena and incense bush.

375
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,160
牧羊树的种植历史则更长
The Shepherd's tree has the deepest documented roots,

376
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,280
树根能延伸至地底450英尺(137米)深处
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

377
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,800
它们在干旱贫瘠的土地上顽强生存
These plants cling to life  in a parched nutrient poor landscape.

378
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,640
是寻猎镖 操控者就在附近
It's a hunter seeker.  The operator must be nearby.

379
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,840
是哈柯南的杀手 六个星期之前就埋伏在洞中了
The harkonnen agent was cemented  into that hole six weeks ago.

380
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,480
用水管在洞里操纵寻猎镖进行偷袭
Manned the hunter seeker  through a water pipe inside the walls.

381
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,150
先生 我让您失望了 没有任何借口
Sir, I failed you today.  There's no excuse.

382
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,790
我向您请辞
You have my resignation.

383
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,800
-你这样的优秀人才我不会放手  -先生 我已声名扫地
- You'd deprive us of your talents?  - Sir, my honor demands

384
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,600
他们想要我儿子的命!
they tried to take the life of my son!

385
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,370
我才不管你的什么声名 想找回声名就去揪出凶手
I don't give a damn about your honor.  You want absolution? Go catch some spies.

386
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,790
遵命
Your grace.

387
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,000
让那鬼玩意儿出去
The thing must leave.

388
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,800
别担心 它听不懂我们在谈什么
You can speak without fear.  Our pet doesn't understand your language.

389
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,720
【滚!】
Get out!

390
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,640
它懂 激活音障
It understands. Activate silence.

391
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,960
皇上要传达什么旨意?
What is the emperor's message?

392
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,000
他将对你施以援手
He will strengthen your hand.

393
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,030
派萨多卡皇家卫队来助你一臂…
With his sardaukar army…

394
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,120
必须绝对保密
it must never be known.

395
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,000
厄拉科斯没有间谍卫星 厄崔迪斯家会葬身于黑暗之中
There's no satellites over arrakis.  The atreides would die in the dark.

396
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,780
还有件事
On that matter.

397
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,030
莱托.厄崔迪斯公爵死了就死了
Duke leto atreides means nothing to our order.

398
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,040
但他的妻子受我们的保护 他的儿子也一样要受我们保护
But his wife is under our protection,  and by extension, her son.

399
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,880
他们应享有流亡的尊严
Allow them the dignity of exile.

400
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,520
哈柯南一族谨遵您的圣训
House harkonnen would never dream  of violating the sanctity of your order.

401
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,720
我保证 绝不伤害他们
I give you my word.  We would not harm them.

402
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,840
-斩草要除根啊大人  -你说得没错
- If the duke's son lives  - no atreides will live.

403
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,800
可是大人 你不是已经向圣尊保证过 而且她耳目众多
My lord, you gave your word to the witch.  And she sees too much.

404
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,800
我说了不伤害他们 就不伤害他们
I said I would not harm them.  And I shall not.

405
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,320
但厄拉科斯就是厄拉科斯
But arrakis is arrakis,

406
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,400
沙漠里适者方可生存
and the desert takes the weak.

407
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,760
可这是我的沙漠
My desert.

408
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,560
我的厄拉科斯
My arrakis.

409
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,120
我的沙丘
My dune.

410
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,110
你的第一次战略会议
Your first strategy meeting.

411
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:31,440
保罗.厄崔迪斯 徒手抓住寻猎镖的英雄人物
Paul atreides, who catches hunter seekers  in his bare hands like a hero of all.

412
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,400
-感谢您的羞辱 老家伙 -我会盯着你的
- Thanks for the humiliation, old man.  - I'll keep an eye on you.

413
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,480
注意!
Attention!

414
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,440
开会了
Let's get started.

415
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,960
杜菲 从你开始
Thufir, operations.

416
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,280
这里有一份哈柯南的账簿
I've secured a copy  of the harkonnen's account books.

417
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,400
他们每年要从这里赚取100亿索拉里币
The harkonnens were taking 10 billion  solaris out of here every year.

418
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,720
他们不仅要吮吸海底的宝藏
"They shall suck at the abundance of the seas

419
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,510
就连藏在沙里的资源也不放过"
and on the treasures hidden in the sand."

420
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,830
短期内我们达不到如此高的利润
We won't see profits like that for a while,

421
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,930
尤其是使用他们留下来的那些设备
not with the equipment they left us.

422
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,400
情况有多糟?
How bad is it?

423
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,830
这里是香料库
These are spice silos.

424
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,770
必须装满每一个货箱(才能完成产量)
We are meant to fill every crate.

425
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,160
所有这些?
All of them?

426
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,120
每二十五个标准日(完成一轮产出)
Every 25 standard days.

427
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,470
哈柯南搞的破坏拖了我们的后腿
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

428
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,910
但是谁来仲裁呢?
But who's meant to arbitrate?

429
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,470
产业交接时没有变时裁决官前来监督的吗?
Isn't there a judge of the change to oversee the transition?

430
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,640
-皇上派谁来的?  -丽雅.凯恩斯博士 帝国的生态学家
- Who did the emperor appoint?  - Dr. Liet kynes, imperial ecologist.

431
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,840
在此地生活了二十年 据说性格十分古怪
Been here 20 years.  Eccentric from what I'm told.

432
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,420
去看看矿区吧
I want to see  these harvesting fields myself.

433
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,150
我不建议您亲自去 大人
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

434
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,060
让那个裁决官陪我们一块儿去
Have this judge of the change  accompany us.

435
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,650
早就该会会她了
Our meeting is long overdue.

436
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,760
至少能得到一丢丢帝国的庇佑
And we'll get a bit of imperial protection.

437
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,190
当人质使吗? 我喜欢
A hostage? I love it.

438
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,640
他到了 大人
He's here, my lord

439
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,560
照顾好他们 来的是我们的朋友
Take care of them, they are friends.

440
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,000
-邓肯! -好小子!
- Duncan!  - My boy!

441
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,880
-我确定你又长高了 -你闻起来更臭了
- I swear you're getting taller.  - Well, you smell much worse.

442
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,990
我和弗雷曼一族共同生活了一个月
For four weeks I've lived with the fremen,

443
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,490
藏在沙漠里一个叫"地穴"的部族里
hidden in the desert,in the community called the sietch.

444
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,480
斯蒂尔加 那个部族的首领也专程前来觐见您了 先生
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch  has come with me to meet you, sir.

445
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,200
-这个部落是 是如何藏身的? -藏在地下
- This sietch, how was it hidden?  - It's under ground.

446
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,100
厄拉科斯处处都是洞穴
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

447
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,340
洞穴有多大?
How big was the place?

448
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,680
能藏一万人 此外 还有数百个同等规模的部族
It's a ten thousand people, and there are hundreds of sietches.

449
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,960
数以百万计的弗雷曼人 你是对的
Millions of fremen. You were right.

450
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,800
哈柯南人估计的这整个星球才只五万人
The harkonnen estimate was fifty thousand on the whole planet.

451
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,280
弗雷曼人连日观察我的搜寻活动 而我连他们的毛都没找到一根
The fremen watched me search  for them for days. I never saw them.

452
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,870
最后 他们派了个战士来杀我
Finally, they sent  a warrior out to kill me,

453
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,740
这么跟你讲吧 那是我离死亡最近的一次
and I have to tell you,  I've never come so close to dying.

454
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,440
帝国最勇猛的战士也不如他
There's no finer fighter in the imperium.

455
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,560
-斗术神鬼莫测  -大漠之力
- They fight like demons.  - Desert power.

456
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,880
-邓肯 干得漂亮   -谢谢 大人
- Duncan, well done.  - Thank you, my lord.

457
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,800
长官 来访的部族首领不肯缴械
Sir, their leader has a knife  he won't surrender, sir.

458
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,630
是晶刃 弗雷曼人神圣的象征
It's a crysknife,  it's sacred to his people.

459
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,360
让他进来
Let him pass.

460
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:51,600
停下
Stop there.

461
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,910
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

462
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,280
斯蒂尔加 欢迎你
Stilgar, welcome.

463
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,440
先生 尊重是相互的
Sir, I respect the personal dignity of any man that respects mine.

464
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,760
且慢
Hold.

465
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,060
谢谢 斯蒂尔加 感谢你馈赠的体液
Thank you, stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture.

466
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,960
我们欣然接受 并予以回礼
We accept it in the spirit  in which it was given.

467
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,520
很高兴你能来
I'm glad you've come.

468
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,280
我相信我们两族人民能互通友好
I believe your people and mine  have much to offer one another.

469
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,060
你们是外来者 来这儿的目的就是为了香料
You are outworlders,  you come here for the spice

470
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,460
掠夺香料 且无任何回报
you take it, giving nothing in return.

471
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,020
你说得没错
That's true.

472
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,670
我知道你们曾在哈柯南人的铁腕下艰难生存
I know you've suffered  at the hands of the harkonnen.

473
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,120
告诉我们你们的需求
Name what you want.

474
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,390
我将尽我所能 不求回报地满足你们
If it's in my power to grant  I'll give it and ask for nothing.

475
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,860
我只求你们别再抓捕我们的族人 别再入侵我们的地盘
I ask for this: Do not seek our sietches,  do not trespass in our lands.

476
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,140
亘古以来 沙漠就是我们的居所
The desert was ours long before you came.

477
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,740
所以 挖矿归挖矿
So, come and dig your spice,

478
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:10,340
挖完了该回哪儿就回哪儿去
but when you have it, go back to this side of the shield wall

479
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,990
把沙漠留给弗雷曼人
and leave the desert to the fremen.

480
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,800
请称呼公爵为"大人"或"阁下"
You will address the duke as "my lord," or "sir."

481
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,200
格尼 停…等一下
Gurney, just… just a moment.

482
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,920
皇上将厄拉科斯册封于我 交给我管理和保护
The emperor has given me arrakis  as my fief to rule and protect.

483
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,320
若皇命驱使 我也不得不从
I cannot promise not to travel  into the desert if duty compels me.

484
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,520
但你部族所辖将永远归属于你
But your sietches will be yours forever.

485
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,770
在我治下 你无需担心被缉捕
And you will never be hunted  while I govern here.

486
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,960
话说得倒漂亮
That's very honorable.

487
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,230
我得走了
I must go.

488
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,630
该说的都说完了
That's all I have to say to you.

489
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,760
为何不留下来 接受我们的荣誉
Why don't you stay.  We would honor you.

490
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,680
荣誉召唤我别有他用
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

491
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,320
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

492
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,720
-我不喜欢他  -我们的谋划终有结果了
- I don't like him.  - Our plan bears fruit.

493
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,110
但还需要时间
But it will take time.

494
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,320
是的 还需要时间
Yes. It will take time.

495
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,560
给 这是给你的
Here, this is for you.

496
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,440
这是定位罗盘
It's a paracompass.

497
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,640
这颗星的月亮有强磁场(上帝之手) 普通的罗盘不管用
The moons here have a magnetic field, so  a simple compass needle won't point north.

498
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,750
要用这种精密点的仪器
Takes a clever piece  of clockwork to sort it out.

499
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,040
这是弗雷曼人做的?
Do fremen make these?

500
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,640
还有像蒸馏服、压沙器等等 好多精巧的玩艺儿
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,  and all kinds of ingenious things.

501
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,840
什么是压沙器?
What the hell is a sand compactor?

502
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,620
这不就是
That's a sand compactor.

503
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,070
我的天 你这是真正融入了啊
My god, man, you've gone native.

504
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,890
你欣赏他们吧
You admire them.

505
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,240
没错
I do.

506
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,530
他们虽然凶猛 但也很忠诚
They're fierce but loyal.

507
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,210
他们已和大漠融为一体 这只是他们的特质之一
They're tuned into the desert,  part of it, it's part of them.

508
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,520
你会有机会亲眼看到的
You wait till you see it.

509
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,440
亲身体会他们的美
It's beautiful out there.

510
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,400
日出警告
Sunrise warning.

511
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,520
预估140度 目前90度
the temperature up to 140 degrees. The temperature now is 90 degrees.

512
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,880
十分钟后到达预估值
But it will rise  50 degrees in ten minutes.

513
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,520
最后警告
Last warning.

514
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,480
这位是变时裁决管 阁下
The judge of the change, sir.

515
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,160
丽雅.凯恩斯博士
Dr. Liet kynes.

516
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,840
公爵大人 欢迎来到厄拉科斯
My lord, duke, welcome to arrakis.

517
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,770
你是帝国的生态学家
You are the imperial ecologist.

518
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,840
谢谢你提供的蒸馏服
Thank you for the stillsuits.

519
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,960
是弗雷曼人做的 顶级的
They are fremen make, the best.

520
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,400
请允许我为各位检查 是否穿戴完好
With your permission, sir,  I must check the integrity

521
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,680
没关系
it's all right.

522
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
没事的
It's all right.

523
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,920
凯恩斯博士 交给你了
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

524
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,320
蒸馏服具备高效水循环处理功能
A stillsuit is a high efficiency  filtration system.

525
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,200
即使像现在的清晨
Even this early in the morning

526
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,580
不穿蒸馏服的话 人也活不过两个小时
you wouldn't survive  two hours without one of these.

527
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,490
它能降低体温 并回收人体蒸发的体液
It cools the body and recycles  the water lost to sweat.

528
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,800
运动起来就能为它供能
Your bodies movements provide the power.

529
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,240
面具内的吸管提供可饮用的循环过滤水
Inside the mask you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.

530
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,480
正常穿着使用的话 一天所消耗的水微乎其微
In good working order your suit won't lose  more than a thimble full of water a day.

531
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,400
真不错
Most impressive.

532
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,760
让我瞧瞧你的 小伙儿
Let's have a look at you, lad.

533
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,080
-你以前穿过这个?  -没有 这是第一次
- You've worn a stillsuit before?  - No, this is my first time.

534
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,000
你的沙漠靴调整得很地道 是有谁教你这么做的吗?
Your desert boots off at a slip fashion  at the ankles. Who taught you to do that?

535
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,600
此似正道
It seemed the right way.

536
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,400
"k习以为常 宛若生而知之"(恰科博萨语)
"He will know his customs as if he was born with them."

537
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,960
你是弗雷曼人吗?
Are you a fremen?

538
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,390
地穴部族和城里人都把我当作自己人
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

539
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,450
现在
Now.

540
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,120
去看看你们心心念念的香料矿吧
Come and see the spice sands  on which your livelihood depends.

541
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,360
万一蜓翼机坠毁了该怎么办?
What would you do if your ornithopter  went down out here?

542
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,000
千万别 这底下可是沙虫的地盘
You wouldn't want to go down out there.  It's worm territory.

543
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,530
沙尘云
Dust cloud.

544
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,280
看到了
I see it.

545
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,920
你们的矿车之一
That's one of your harvesters.

546
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,320
你可以看到香料散落其上
You can see the spice scattered over the surface.

547
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,520
富矿区域颜色会更丰富
Rich spice bed by the color.

548
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,100
飞得再高点就能看得更清楚了
If you get a little higher  you'll have a better view.

549
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,640
那边的侦察机负责侦查沙虫的动静
You see these spotter aircraft  looking for worm sign.

550
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,920
怎么查?
Worm sign?

551
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,140
一旦有沙虫向矿车移动 就会产生痕迹
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

552
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,720
沙虫在流沙深处移动 攻击时 会上浮到表面
Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack.

553
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,720
有耐心等的话 会看到的
If you are patient we should see one.

554
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,840
-它们总会来吗?  -它们会被有节奏的噪音所吸引
- Worm always comes?  - Always, they're drawn by rhythmic noises.

555
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,950
为什么不用护盾挡住它们呢?
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

556
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,710
在大漠里用护盾就是找死
A shield is a death sentence  in the desert.

557
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,040
它能吸引沙虫的注意 还会疯狂追杀
It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.

558
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,640
那是沙虫吗?
Is that a worm?

559
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,890
是只大的
Big one.

560
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,890
你的眼神真好
You have good eyes.

561
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:56,560
呼叫DA9 沙虫警告 收到请回话

Who calls delta ajax 9? Over.

563
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,280
-他们听起来一点不慌啊  -这里是帝国非在编飞行器
- They seem pretty calm about it.  - Unlisted flight, imperium business.

564
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,560

Worm sign, north and east of you.  3.7 kilometers.

565
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,720
侦察机S1呼叫矿车DA9 已确认沙虫位置
Delta ajax 9, this is spotter 1, worm sighting confirmed.

566
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,720
等待恢复通讯
Standby for contact fix.

567
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,720
沙虫来袭 五分钟后到达你所处位置
Worm is on intercept course  to your position. Contact in five minutes.

568
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,800
现在怎么办?
So what happens now?

569
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,810
会呼叫运载机来接它
They'll call the carryall  to lift the crawler.

570
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,200
而他们会采集到最后一刻
They'll harvest right up to the last minute.

571
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,160
呼叫运载机A0号 预备接驳
Calling carryall alfa zero.  Ready to docking sequence.

572
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,080
五分钟后联系 完毕
Contact five minutes, over.

573
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
看见运载机了吗?
Anybody got a visual on a carryall?

574
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,800
在那里
There it is.

575
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,560
运载机A0呼叫DA9
This is carryall alfa zero  to delta ajax 9.

576
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,400
将从你的东侧切入
Approaching from your east.

577
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,490
调整高度 准备接驳
Correcting altitude and preparing  docking and gripping.

578
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,840
收到 A0 启动接驳程序
Copy, alpha zero.  Initiating docking sequence.

579
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,320
-T5 -收到
- T 5.  - Copy that.

580
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,580
-30秒后提升  -停靠完毕
- Prepare to be airborne in 30 seconds.  - Docking sequence initiated.

581
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,990
请保持
Brace yourselves.

582
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,160
A0 有一处支点未接驳成功
Alpha zero, we are short on one point of contact.

583
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,440
-怎么回事?  -有个锚出故障了
- What is going on?  - It's one of the anchors. It's dead.

584
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,960
见鬼
Shit.

585
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,760
不锚定那个点 运载机无法继续
Carryall, unable to proceed.  Unable to lift without that anchor.

586
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,640
全频道呼叫 全频道呼叫
All call. All call.

587
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,920
本区域所有运载机 收到请回话
Any carryall in the sector,  please respond.

588
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,530
侦察机S1 汇报最新情况 完毕
Spotter 1, give us an update. Over.

589
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,120
液压装置失灵 我们无能为力了 请尽快撤离
Hydraulics are dead.  We won't make it. You have to evacuate.

593
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,680
这里是莱托.厄崔迪斯公爵
This is duke leto atreides.

594
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,890
我们要下去营救DA9矿车组员
We're coming down  to extract the crew of delta ajax 9.

595
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,000
请于左翼待援
Sit down on the left.

596
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,360
护盾发生器每台重100公斤
The shield generators  weigh 100 kilos each.

597
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,200
-没错 格尼 安排人扔掉  -遵命
-Yes, gurney, have our escort throw out the shield generators.  -Yes sir.

598
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,200
保罗 你坐在机舱后面 接他们上机
And Paul, I want you at the back  of the thopter, guide them in.

599
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,040
矿机D9号 七人一组上我方飞机撤离
Delta ajax 9, put seven  men each in my ships now.

600
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,240
沙虫两分钟来袭
Contact in two minutes.

601
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,160
越来越近了 伙计们 最好现在就弃车
It's getting close, guys.  We better abandon the ship now.

602
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,800
咋还没来?
Where are they?

603
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,420
长官 我们都签了协议
Sir, there is protocol for a reason,

604
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,590
如果弃车 我们也是个死
if we take one step out  we're as good as dead.

605
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,480
再说了 满满一车香料 不能就这么一走了之
Besides, we've got full load  of spice, we can't just leave

606
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,080
去他妈的香料!所有人都赶紧弃车!
damn the spice! I want  every man off that crawler now!

607
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,690
七个人去这边 七个人去那边!
Seven over here, seven over there!

608
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,280
快 快!
Run, run!

609
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,480
魁萨茨.哈德拉克
Kwisatz haderach.

610
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,480
魁萨茨.哈德拉克苏醒了

611

快点! 上来!
Hurry! Get on!

612
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,280
它来了!
It's here!

613
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,000
保罗!
Paul!

614
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,560
保罗!
Paul!

615
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,520
听脚步声就知道是你 老头子
I recognize your footsteps, old man.

616
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,680
快起来 走吧
Get up. Let's go.

617
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,640
你怎么了? 快点 我们走
What's wrong with you?  Come on. Let's go.

618
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,080
跑!
Run!

619
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,280
(恰科博萨语)"赞美造物主以及k的甘霖 赞美k的翻滚腾挪
"Bless the maker and his water.  Bless the coming and going of him.

620
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:11,440
愿k所到之处皆洁净清明 k的子民皆和谐安宁"
May his passage cleanse the world.  And keep the world for his people."

621
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,480
-嘿 不许你再这么冒险  -是 长官
- Hey, you cannot take such risks.  - Yes, sir.

622
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,040
-你身负重任 -对不起 长官 不会再有下次了  -滚蛋
- You do have responsibilities.  - I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.  -Go

623
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,560
凯恩斯博士
Dr. Kynes.

624
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,800
如你亲眼所见
You saw it with your own eyes.

625
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,550
毫无疑问 他们留给我们的是一堆破烂货
It's plain to see. Everything  they've left us is in shambles.

626
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,040
失败是必然结果
We've been set up to fail.

627
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,520
那台运载机只是太老旧 沙漠对机械设备很不友好
That carryall was just old.  The desert isn't kind to equipment.

628
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,960
你知道如果香料供应跟不上 会有什么后果吗?
You know what will happen if I don't get  spice production back on track?

629
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,960
我来这里可不是与您共患难的
I'm not here to take your part.

630
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:14,000
厄拉科斯来来往往像您这样的人多了去了
Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.

631
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,760
好好照顾好您的家人吧
Take good care of your family.

632
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,160
沙漠对人类也并不友好
The desert's not kind to humans either.

633
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:46,600
香料这种化学物质具有精神类活性特征 有点过敏罢了
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.  You seem to be sensitive.

634
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,280
你并无大碍
You'll be fine.

635
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,000
谢谢 岳医生
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

636
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,520
但这并非过敏反应
It wasn't an allergic reaction.

637
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,270
我是在清醒状态下
I had a vision.

638
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,430
产生了幻觉
My eyes were wide open.

639
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,560
你看到了什么?
What did you see?

640
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,760
魁萨茨.哈德拉克…
Kwisatz haderach…

641
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,800
汝可视
you can see.

642
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:44,320
很奇怪 我以为看见自己死了 但并不是
It's confusing, I thought  I saw my death, only it wasn't.

643
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,680
幻像告诉我匕首是件很重要的东西
I know a knife is important somehow.

644
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,080
有人会递给我一柄匕首
Someone will hand me a blade.

645
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,440
但我也不清楚是谁 在何时 何地给的我
But I don't know who or when or where.

646
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:03,360
但有些清晰明了的事实 我能感觉得到
Some things though  are crystal clear. I can feel it.

647
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,660
我知道你怀孕了
I know you're pregnant.

648
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,680
这不可能
You can't know that.

649
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,920
我自己也是刚刚知道 才怀上几周而已
I barely know that and it's only been few weeks.

650
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,520
男爵找我们干什么?
What does the baron want with us?

651
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,640
哈柯南的人数远胜厄崔迪斯
The harkonnen outnumber atreides.

652
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,160
厄崔迪斯族军是帝国中最精锐的武装力量
Atreides legions are the finest  in the imperium.

653
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,760
由格尼.哈勒克和邓肯.爱达荷训练
Trained by gurney halleck  and duncan idaho.

654
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:22,920
我们是萨多卡皇家精英部队 任何叛逆都必将死无葬身之地
We are the sardaukar, the emperor's elite.  Anyone who defies us will fall.

655
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,160

Just so.

656
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,840
皇上口谕 出动三个营
Three battalions as agreed.

657
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,120
皇命所归 必马到功成

658
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,000
有些关于保罗的事得让你知道
There's something you need  to know about Paul.

659
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,680
不 我不想知道
No. I don't think I wanna know.

660
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,180
自打你把他带去你那个圣母看了之后
Ever since you brought him before  your reverend mother

661
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,000
他就变了个样子
he hasn't been the same.

662
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,480
魂不守舍的
He's distracted.

663
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,760
洁茜卡 你给我生了个儿子
Jessica, you gave me a son.

664
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,000
从他出生的那一刻起 我从未质疑过你
And from the moment he was born  I never questioned you.

665
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,440
我对你信任有加 放任你与姐妹会(学院)藕断丝连
I trusted you completely, even when you walked in shadows.

666
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,600
现在我只问你一件事
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

667
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,440
如果灾厄降临 你会庇护我们的儿子吗?
If anything happens  will you protect our son?

668
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,480
我以我性命担…
With my life.

669
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,480
我没问你 我指的是本尼.洁瑟里特(学院)
I'm not asking his mother,  I'm asking the bene gesserit.

670
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,000
你们会庇护保罗吗?
Will you protect Paul?

671
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,360
你怎么会这么想?
Why are you having these thoughts?

672
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,440
莱托 这可不像你
Leto, this is not you.

673
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,840
我曾以为我们时间足够

674
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,920
-晚安 保罗少主  -晚安 岳医生
- Have a good night, master Paul.  - Good night, Dr. Yueh.

675
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,080

城防护盾失效
The shield's come down.

682
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,040

688
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,800
抱歉 大人
I'm sorry, my lord.

689
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,600
但我与男爵做了个交易

690
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,080
-为什么?  -我别无选择

691
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,480
哈柯南人抓了我的老婆 万娜

692
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:18,060
他们威胁要将她大卸八块
They take her apart like a doll.

693
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,160
为了救她 我不得不出卖你
I will buy her freedom  and you are the price.

694
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
给保罗的 我会尽我所能交给他
For Paul. I will do what I can.

695
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,000
而你要为我杀一个人
And you will kill a man for me.

696
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,840
我会给你安一颗假牙
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

697
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,680
大力咬下去就会碎
If you bite them hard,  this tooth will crash.

698
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,680
一旦吐气 空气中会弥漫剧毒
Breathe out, and you will fill  the air with poison.

699
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,730
而这 将是你的最后一口气

只要时机得当
But if you choose your moment well

701
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,040
也将会是男爵的最后一口气

702
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,840
保罗
Paul.

703
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:48,280
把他们扔到沙漠去喂沙虫
We will drop them in the desert,  and leave them to the worms.

704
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,840
为什么不直接干掉?
Why not just cut their throats?

705
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,160
万一有真言师查起来
They might use a truthsayer.

706
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,800
就能把事情推得一干二净
Then we can honestly say  that we didn't kill them.

707
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:09,120
[有疤的那人是聋子]
The one with the scar is deaf.

708
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,360
下地狱吧 狗腿子!
To hell, dogs!

709
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,600
我还从没干过贵族呢

01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,120
-你呢?  -她是姐妹会的人 不是贵族
- You?  - Bene gesserit ain't no high born.

711
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,080
对我来说已经够贵了
She is high born enough for me.

712
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,160
先把那小子扔了 再来慢慢和她道别
Let's feed the kid to the worms  and give her a long goodbye.

713
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,400

闭嘴

715
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,760
[别乱来 还不到时候]

01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,840
飞得够远了 扔了那小子
We're far enough.  Let's throw the boy off.

720
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,240

725
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,840
你说得太过刻意
Your pitch was too forced.

726
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:32,920
是弗雷曼工具包(弗雷曼人制造的沙漠逃生工具包)
It's a fremkit.

727
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,480
他们破坏了飞机
They've crippled the ship.

728
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,840
你家的厨子真不错 表弟
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

729
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:38,800
这是岳医生的笔迹
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

730
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:44,040
"活着从厄拉基恩城逃出来的人 这包里有个信标
"If anyone makes it out of arrakeen alive there's an atreides beacon in the fremkit.

God willing they'd be able to find you."

732

那个叛徒?

你想要什么?

正好和她团聚
So join her.

742
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,640

743
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,800

745
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,210
那才是我们需要的
The one thing we actually need.

746
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,170
我们两大家族明争暗斗几百年
For hundreds of years  we've traded blood for blood.

747
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:32,670
到此为止了

748
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,400
你的独子 死了 宠姬 也死了

今晚你家房倒屋塌

-凯恩斯! -你们不该来这儿
- Kynes!  - It's not safe for you here.

755
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,410
告诉他们是如何被野蛮屠杀

我已领命 莫言 勿视

There were sardaukar with them.

790
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,360
-至少两个营 -你确定?
- At least two battalions.  - Are you sure?

791
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,800
从他们的包围中冲出来 自然清楚
You cross swords  with the sardaukar, you know it.

792
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,120
所以 皇帝选边站了
So, the emperor's taken a side.

793
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,360
变时仲裁官 你怎么看?
What says the judge of the change?

794
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,180
皇上禁止我发表任何看法
The emperor forbids me  from saying anything at all.

795
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,200
但你却冒着生命危险来救我们
Yet you risk your life to help us.

796
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,160
沙尘暴快来了
The storm is coming.

797
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,520
沙尘暴几个小时就到了 呆在这里很安全
The storm will be here in a few hours.  We'll be safe here.

798
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:26,880
知道这是哪儿吗? 是个古老的生态实验站
Do you know what this place is?  It's an old ecological testing station.

799
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,280
他们本来是想通过引出沙漠深处的水源
The were meant to tame the planet

800
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:34,740
来改造这颗星球的
and free the water locked  beneath the sands.

801
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,440
厄拉科斯本可以成为天堂
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

802
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,980
前期工作已经就绪的时候却发现了香料矿
The work had begun  but then the spice was discovered.

803
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,740
于是突然之间 就没有人再希望沙漠消失了
And suddenly no one wanted  the desert to go away.

804
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,610
塔纳特 能给客人找几件合身的衣服吗?
Tanat, will you find  stillsuits to fit our visitors.

805
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:49,700
好的 丽雅
Yes, liet.

806
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:52,560
-沙米尔 请端点咖啡来 -没问题 丽雅
- Shamir, coffee service, please.  - Of course, liet.

807
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:57,720
你是弗雷曼人的什么人?
Who are you to the fremen?

808
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,800
你知道大家族最害怕什么吗 凯恩斯博士?
Do you know what the great houses  fear most, Dr. Kynes?

809
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,960
就是现在发生在我们身上的这些事
Exactly what has happened to us here.

810
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,000
萨多卡人会依样画葫芦 一个接一个地干掉他们
The sardaukar coming  and picking them off one by one.

811
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,600
只有联合起来 才有机会对抗帝国
Only together can they stand a chance  against the imperium.

812
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,410
你会去作证吗?
Would you bare witness?

813
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,990
证明皇帝对我们挥出了屠刀
Testify that the emperor  has moved against us here.

814
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,570
如果他们相信我的话…
If they believe me…

815
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,790
大家族和皇族之间将会开启一场全面战争
there would be general warfare  between the great houses and the emperor.

816
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,800
整个帝国将一片混乱
Chaos across the imperium.

817
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:22,000
假设我能给皇帝提供一个替代混乱的方法呢
Let's suppose I present to the emperor  with an alternative to chaos.

818
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,560
皇帝没有儿子 有未出嫁的女儿
And the emperor has no sons,  and his daughters are yet to marry.

819
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,390
你想篡夺王位?
You'd make a play for the throne?

820
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:32,100
皇帝忌惮厄崔迪斯家族 他派你们来就是要除掉你们
The emperor feared the atreides.  He brought you here to kill you.

821
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,030
你还不明白吗?
What don't you understand?

822
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,480
你只是个慌不择路 困于地洞的小男孩
You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground.

823
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,920
弗雷曼人称呼我为李桑.阿尔盖伊布
The fremen speak of the lisan al gaib.

824
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,640
小心
Careful.

825
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,240
异域救主将引领他们进入天堂
The voice from the outer world  who will lead them to paradise.

826
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,680
异端邪说
Superstition.

827
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,560
我知道你爱上过一位战死沙场的弗雷曼战士
I know you loved a fremen warrior  and lost him in battle.

828
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,920
我知道你曾辗转于两处世界 化名众多
I know you walk in two worlds  and are known by many names.

829
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,800
我看得见你的理想
I've seen your dream.

830
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:19,350
我若成皇 凯恩斯博士
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

831
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:22,490
只需轻轻挥手 就能还厄拉科斯一个天堂
I could make a paradise for arrakis  with the wave of my hand.

832
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,680
你真觉得他会是救世主吗?
Do you really think he could be the mahdi?

833
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,520
他看上去太年轻了
He looks very young.

834
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,760
萨多卡人!
Sardaukar

835
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:21,280
-别!邓肯!  -保罗,别去!
- No! Duncan!  - Paul, no!

836
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,480
-邓肯,不!  -他把门封死了
- Duncan, no!  - He's locked the door.

837
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,840
他死了
He's gone.

838
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:18,380
邓肯!
Duncan!

839
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,100
我们得走了 没别的办法了
We have to go. We have no choice.

840
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,600
保罗 快跑!
Paul, run!

841
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,680
快啊 快啊!
Come on, come on!

842
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:23,060
顺着光标走 你会看到有架蜓翼机停在那儿
Follow the light. You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

843
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:25,270
沙尘暴会为你们提供掩护
That storm out there  is your best shot.

844
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,920
沙暴席卷范围高达五千米 飞进去 停留在沙暴上方躲避
Above 5000 meters, it's mostly dust.  Climb into it. Stay on top.

845
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:33,010
-然后一直往南 去找弗雷曼人  -你不和我们一起?
- Head south. Find the fremen.  - You're not coming with us?

846
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,280
只有两个座位
It only sits two.

847
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:37,830
我去下个生态站 把这次袭击报上报立法院
I'll go to the next station and report this attack to the landsraad.

848
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,680
怎么去?
How?

849
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,750
我可是弗雷曼人 沙漠就是我的家
I'm fremen. The desert is my home.

850
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,840
-祝好运 -祝好运
- Good luck.  - Good luck.

851
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,600
凯恩斯 你背叛了皇上
Kynes, you have betrayed the emperor.

852
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,620
我只侍奉一个主人
I serve only one master.

853
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:26,140
他的名字叫沙葫芦
His name is shai hulud.

854
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,900
后面有追兵
There are jet flyers behind us.

855
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,200
保罗 飞得高度还不够!
Paul, we are not high enough!

856
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,840
我不能害怕 恐惧是心灵的杀手
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

857
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,320
恐惧是引发毁灭的小小死神
Fear is the little death  that brings total obliteration.

858
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,680
看呐 朋友
See the friend.

859
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:44,120
生命的奥秘无需解答
The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve.

860
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,440
只需亲身体验
But a reality to experience.

861
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,160
它无法暂停
A process that cannot be understand  by stopping it.

862
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,520
只能随时光滚滚前行
We must move with the flow of the process.

863
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:03,200
融入其中 滚滚前行
We must join it.  We must float with it.

864
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,240
随它去吧 随它去吧
Let it go. Let it go.

865
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,430
大人尚未痊愈
He hasn't fully healed yet.

866
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:56,240
我们把他们赶进了科里奥利风暴中
We chased them into a coriolis storm.

867
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,400
风速每小时八百公里
Wind's at 800 kilometers an hour.

868
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,760
没有人能在这样的风暴中幸存
Nothing survives such a storm.

869
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:11,160
他们死定了 必死无疑
They're dead. It's a certainty.

870
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,720
也就是终于搞定了
So it's done finally.

871
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:27,480
给杰迪母星传信 香料储备可以开卖了
Send word to giedi prime to begin selling our spice reserves.

872
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:31,440
慢慢卖 我们可不希望价格下跌
But slowly.  We don't want the price to fall.

873
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,360
你是不知道 我为这事花费了多大代价
You have no idea how much it cost me  to bring such a force to barrier.

874
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:40,160
现在我只有一个要求 收入
Now I only have one requirement. Income.

875
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:44,840
所以 赚钱 拉班 狠狠地给我赚钱
So, squeeze, rabban. Squeeze hard.

876
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,170
遵命 叔父
Yes, uncle.

877
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,790
弗雷曼人如何应对?
And the fremen?

878
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,160
灭掉他们
Kill them all.

879
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,360
我们在五千米高空之上
We're above 5000 meters.

880
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:52,920
一但着陆 立刻跑向山岩
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

881
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,040
用这个呼吸
You breathe with this.

882
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,340
现在我们必须得找到弗雷曼人
Now we have to find the fremen.

883
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,680
-你还好吗?  -是的
- Are you good?  - Yeah.

884
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,440
保罗…
Paul…

885
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,560
别害怕
Don't be frightened.

886
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:36,360
弱小如沙鼠 也有其生存之道
Even a little desert mouse can survive.

887
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,880
你要直面自己的恐惧
You'll need to face your fears.

888
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:47,320
朋友会帮助你
A friend will help you.

889
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:50,680
遵循他的指引
Follow the friend.

890
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,430
你要学的还很多
You have much to learn.

891
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:58,720
我也会指引你大漠之道
And I will show you  the ways of the desert.

892
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,520
随我来
Come with me.

893
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,600
地穴 邓肯曾经呆过的部落
The sietch, where duncan lived.

894
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,760
就在那边的某个地方
Somewhere off that way.

895
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,420
我能看见那边的绿洲
I can see the green over there.

896
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,840
那里
There.

897
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,790
这意味着弗雷曼人也住在那里
That means fremen live there.

898
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:52,000
天黑之后我们再去 弗雷曼人都这么干
We'll cross after dark.  That's how the fremen do it.

899
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:56,120
再走就是沙虫的领地了
We're about to enter worm territory.

900
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:59,590
不能再像平常那样走路 不然就死定了
We can't walk like regular humans,  if we do we're dead.

901
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:03,160
得像弗雷曼人那样 用他们称作"沙舞"的方式行走
We'll have to walk like the fremen do.  It's called the sand walk.

902
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,380
我从地理简介上学来的
At least according  to the film books back home.

903
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:07,470
好了好了 我知道了
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it.

904
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:10,880
好吧 跟我学 做同样的动作
Okay, follow me. Do the same moves.

905
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:24,930
我觉得走这边没错
I think this is the right direction.

906
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,920
很近了 接着走吧
It's close by. Let's get out of here.

907
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,120
等等
Wait.

908
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,280
沙鼓起来了
It's drum sand.

909
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,440
快跑!
Run!

910
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:07,040
快! 快!
Go! Go!

911
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,040
是沙槌在响
It's a thumper.

912
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:25,080
有人在敲沙槌
Someone set off a thumper.

913
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,240
保罗,快跑!
Paul, run!

914
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:58,200
这东西也太大了吧? 太疯狂了
How big are they? That was insane.

915
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,880
有人把它引走了
Someone called him.

916
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:14,600
[来人了]
We are not alone.

917
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:35,200
别跑
Do not run.

918
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:39,570
那样只会浪费身体的水份
You will only waste your bodies water.

919
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,280
等等
Hold.

920
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:49,840
斯蒂尔加
Stilgar.

921
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,360
嘿 你见过我的 在我父亲的会议上
Hey, you know me. I was there  when you came to my father's council.

922
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,520
是公爵的儿子啊
This is the duke's son.

923
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:00,120
还在等什么? 我们需要他们的水
Why are you waiting?  We need their water.

924
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,600
这就是我跟你们提到过的那个男孩 不能动他
This is the boy I told you about.  We can't touch him.

925
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:07,720
-他是李桑.阿尔盖伊布吗?  -他并没有自证
- Is he lisan al gaib?  - He hasn't proved himself.

926
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:11,280
-他们是弱者  -贾米斯
- They're weaklings.  - Jamis…

927
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:15,560
他们勇敢地穿过了沙葫芦的领地
there was a brave crossing  they made in the path of shai hulud.

928
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:18,480
他的言行举止也不似弱者
He does not speak  or act like a weakling.

929
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:21,450
他的父亲也并非弱者
Nor did his father.

930
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:23,960
是我用沙槌救了他的命
My thumper saved his life.

931
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:28,360
理智一点 斯蒂尔加 他也并非救世主
Go back to reason, stilgar.  He's not the one.

932
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,440
我们有强大的朋友
We have powerful friends.

933
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:36,760
帮我们回到卡拉丹 你会得到丰厚的回报
You help us off world, to caladan,  you will be well rewarded.

934
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,840
除了你体内的水 你还能有什么可回报的?
What wealth can you offer  beyond the water in your flesh.

935
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,930
这个孩子还小 他可以学习我们的道
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

936
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:51,410
他可以留
He may have sanctuary.

937
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,320
可这个女人就算了
But the woman isn't trained

938
02:08:57,110 --> 02:08:58,340
年纪太大 学不了了
and too old to learn.

939
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:30,810
退后 狗腿子们!
Back, you dogs!

940
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:33,500
她会割断我的喉咙
She'll cut my throat.

941
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,880
为何不早说你是个 会玄秘道术的战士?
Why didn't you say you were  a weirding woman and a fighter?

942
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,240
你们没给机会说
The conversation ran short.

943
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:48,480
休战 女人 休战
Peace, woman, peace.

944
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:50,820
是我判断错误
I misjudged.

945
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,880
太阳快升起来了 得赶紧回地穴
The sun is rising.  We must reach sietch tabr.

946
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:07,800
到了那里再决定外来者的命运
The fate of the strangers  will be decided there.

947
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:17,320
在此之前 他们有我保护
Until then, they are under my protection.

948
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:21,440
我向你们保证
I give you my word.

949
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:30,830
我不会让你伤害我的朋友
I would not have let you  hurt my friends.

950
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,790
他们说你是救世主
They say you are the mahdi.

951
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:59,310
但你不过还是个小男孩
But you look like a little boy.

952
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,320
你选了一条最艰难的道路 跟我来
You chose the hardest way up. Follow me.

953
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:08,720
出发 出发了!
Take off! Take off!

954
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,970
把它给我
Give it to me.

955
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:22,180
这毛拉枪(发射飞镖) 你得靠自己本事赢来
You would have your own maula pistol  when you've earned it.

956
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:23,540
把它给我
Give it to me.

957
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:32,850
茶妮 新来的交给你 要保证他们的安全
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.  See that they are safe in the journey.

958
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,970
走吧
Let's go.

959
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:36,760
我不同意
I will not have them.

960
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:45,600
贾米斯 我说过了 别乱来
Jamis, I have spoken. Be still.

961
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,840
你言谈像头领 身手却不像
You talk like a leader,  but the strongest leads.

962
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:53,680
她打败了你
She bested you.

963
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,560
所以我要挑战她(阿姆塔尔规则)
I invoke the amtal.

964
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:00,080
-你不可挑战萨亚迪娜(造物主)  -那谁以她的名义来?
- You may not challenge a sayyadina.  - Then who will fight in her name?

965
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:05,240
贾米斯 别这样 别 快天亮了
Jamis, don't do this. Don't.  The night is fading.

966
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:08,060
那太阳将作为死亡的见证
Then the sun will witness this death.

967
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:09,950
她的捍卫者在哪?
Where is her champion?

968
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,360
我接受这名捍卫者
I accept her champion.

969
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:55,810
保罗.厄崔迪斯必须死去…
Paul atreides must die…

970
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,160
魁萨茨.哈德拉斯方可崛起
for kwisatz haderach to rise.

971
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:10,900
别害怕 别抗拒
Don't be frightened. Don't resist.

972
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,560
欲夺他人之命 必先拼了自己的命
When you take a life, you take your own.

973
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:55,560
我不信你是李桑.阿尔盖伊布
I don't believe you are the lisan al gaib.

974
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:58,280
但我希望你死得其所
But I want you to die with honor.

975
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:12,120
这柄晶刃是我的姑婆送给我的
This crysknife was given to me  by my great aunt.

976
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:18,800
用好大一只沙葫芦的一颗牙做的
It's made from a tooth of shai hulud,  the great sand worm.

977
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:22,560
握着它死去 你会死得其所
This would be a great honor  if you to die holding it.

978
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:29,000
外来者去哪了?
Where is the outworlder?

979
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:38,160
贾米斯是个好斗士 不会让你死得痛苦
Jamis is a good fighter.  He won't let you suffer.

980
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,480
茶妮
Chani…

981
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,360
别介意
Never mind.

982
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,960
愿你刀断刃碎
May your knife chip and shatter.

983
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,000
愿你喜迎刀锋
You should welcome my blade.

984
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:03,600
愿这世界抛弃你
This world will kill you.

985
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:07,640
愿你赶早证道升天
Quicker this way.

986
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,400
认输吗?
Do you yield?

987
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,880
这孩子不懂我们的规矩
The boy does not know our rule.

988
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:55,810
在阿姆塔尔规则之下 必须决出生死
There is no yielding under the amtal  rule, only death is the test of that.

989
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,690
-他在戏耍他吗?  -没有
- Is he toying with him?  - No.

990
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,560
保罗从来没杀过人
Paul has never killed a man.

991
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:22,920
魁萨茨.哈德拉克(救世主)
Kwisatz haderach.

992
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:29,040
魁萨茨.哈德拉克(救世主)
Kwisatz haderach.

993
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,760
越过他 崛起吧
Climb up. Rise.

994
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:24,480
你是我们的一员了 一命换一命
You're one of us now. A life for a life.

995
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:27,440
-跟我们一起去塔布地穴  -不
- Come with us to sietch tabr.  - No.

996
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,080
保罗得离开这里
Paul needs to get off world.

997
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:32,060
你一定有办法 你有走私客 有飞船
You must have ways.  You have smugglers, you have ships.

998
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:33,570
-我不走 -你有…
- No.  - You have

999
02:19:34,650 --> 02:19:36,480
皇帝指派我们来这里
the emperor sent us to this place.

1000
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,540
而我父亲来到这里的目的…
And my father came…

1001
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:45,000
却不是为了香料 也不是为了敛财
not for spice, not for the riches,

1002
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:46,610
是为了团结你们的力量
but for the strength of your people.

1003
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,940
我的道在大漠之中
My road leads into the desert.

1004
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,760
我能看见
I could see it.

1005
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:02,070
如果你们愿意接纳 我也愿意来
If you'll have us, we will come.

1006
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:50,260
大漠之力
Desert power.

1007
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,180
这才只是开始
This is only the beginning.
