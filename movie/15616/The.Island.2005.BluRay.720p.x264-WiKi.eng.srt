1
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,607
You're special.

2
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:58,514
You have a very special
purpose in life.

3
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:02,291
You've been chosen.

4
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:16,205
The lsland awaits you.

5
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,190
l'm fine, l'm fine, l'm fine.

6
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,221
Good morning, Tower One.

7
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,884
Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.

8
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,449
Sunny and mild.

9
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:57,563
Hey, l'm missing a left shoe.

10
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:04,012
And when you get a chance,
l'd like another color.

11
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,359
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,566
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- l'm missing a shoe.

13
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:41,780
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,611
Thank you.

15
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,586
We're full.

16
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,423
Good morning.
July 19th, 2019.

17
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,761
Another day in paradise.

18
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:12,877
Starkweather Two Delta,

19
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,314
your time has come.

20
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:17,353
You're moving out to the lsland.

21
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,388
Starkweather Two Delta here.

22
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:22,857
And, as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.

23
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,656
l've only been with you guys
for, like, six months,

24
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,492
but l won the lottery.

25
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:30,192
- That's right, me, Starkweather, OK?
- Six months.

26
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:34,760
To go out and breathe fresh air,
swim in the ocean...

27
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:39,001
l can't believe l won.
You call me Mr. Popular, l know.

28
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,771
lt's me. lt's me.

29
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:46,475
You guys know l'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.

30
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:50,013
l'm going to the lsland!
We're gonna have so much fun!

31
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:54,022
But l need to see you guys out there.
You can do it! l won!

32
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,387
That was this week's...

33
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,018
We got a disturbance
on elevator 12, plaza level.

34
00:05:58,094 --> 00:06:01,825
...just moments before his
final departure to the lsland,

35
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:04,958
nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.

36
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,264
- Lucky guy, huh?
- You can be a winner too.

37
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,430
The next lottery is tonight.

38
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:15,438
The next lottery is tonight.

39
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:20,581
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

40
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:24,218
- What about you?
- Three.

41
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,278
Three. l've been here seven.

42
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:30,622
lf l do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

43
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,892
l'm such a loser.

44
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,993
Sir.

45
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:09,054
Yeah, you.

46
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:12,625
Swipe.

47
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:17,664
Gandu Three Echo, you've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

48
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:20,743
Yes, l had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

49
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,404
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

50
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:27,511
- l'm feeling much better.
- Well, then, have a pleasant day.

51
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:30,451
Thank you, you too.
You both have a pleasant day too.

52
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,876
Feel the stretch.

53
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:57,843
One more breath in.

54
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,160
But l was in that section.

55
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:17,824
No, l don't understand!

56
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:20,529
- l tried! l tried to do the best l...
- Listen to me!

57
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:26,508
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

58
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:30,409
A healthy person is a happy person.

59
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:41,055
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

60
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,614
No bacon today?

61
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,887
You got a nutrition flag,
means no bacon.

62
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,486
ln that case, two eggs,
over easy, not too runny,

63
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,996
and a side of sausages.

64
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,898
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

65
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:56,400
You ain't cute and l got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

66
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,406
Now, what's it gonna be?

67
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,532
Move it.

68
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:03,709
Surprise me.

69
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,477
Surprise.

70
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,750
Yummy. Next.

71
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,333
Watch and learn.

72
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,934
Next.

73
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,475
Jordan Two Delta.

74
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,102
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

75
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:39,704
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

76
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:42,649
- Eggs, please.
- OK.

77
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:47,118
So, where were you the other day?
We missed you.

78
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:50,884
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

79
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,188
Get you anything else?

80
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:55,459
Maybe a little bacon.

81
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,124
No, it says l shouldn't.

82
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,932
- Go ahead.
- Four, five pieces, please.

83
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:04,970
Thank you.

84
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:08,734
Well, good luck.
Gotta run along now.

85
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:12,076
You're not going.
You gotta stay for dinner.

86
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:14,810
- l softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

87
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,580
- Back on your diet?
- You kidding? l love this stuff.

88
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:20,417
Better eat up.
You'll need all your strength tonight.

89
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,684
ls that a challenge?

90
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,386
l promise l'll go easy on you.

91
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:30,196
Please separate.
Find your seats now.

92
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah.

93
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:37,904
'''Who wants Sally?' said Dick.
'l do,' said Jane.

94
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:40,772
'l cannot find Sally.

95
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:45,542
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.

96
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:48,209
ls Sally here?'''

97
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:03,193
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

98
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:10,470
What'd you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

99
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,140
Sir?

100
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:21,013
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please.

101
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:31,626
Please, sit down.

102
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:35,090
So, how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

103
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,724
Not so good, l guess.

104
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,791
Why do you say that?

105
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:42,667
Well, if l'm here,
it means l'm not so good.

106
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:45,764
That's a rather negative association.

107
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:50,278
My only job is to see that you're happy,
things are OK with you.

108
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:51,938
Right.

109
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:58,211
Your file shows that you've
been interacting regularly

110
00:11:58,287 --> 00:11:59,584
with Jordan Two Delta.

111
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:03,591
- There's no law against friendship.
- No. No, we encourage it,

112
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,062
but, obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

113
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:10,099
l know the rules of proximity.

114
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:15,097
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

115
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:18,196
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

116
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:21,834
But screening has picked up
some trace levels,

117
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:26,040
changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

118
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,913
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

119
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,579
Why don't you tell me
about your dream?

120
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:36,691
Well, it's the same dream every time.
l'm on a boat, headed to the lsland.

121
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,024
A boat? What kind of boat?

122
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,895
A nice boat.

123
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,523
Draw it for me, would you?

124
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,475
So, you are heading
toward the lsland.

125
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:55,534
What happens then?

126
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:58,478
- l drown.
- Really?

127
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:02,508
- Why do you think that is?
- l don't know. You tell me.

128
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:05,611
- Maybe you're afraid of winning.
- Why would l be afraid?

129
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:07,553
You tell me.

130
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:14,661
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

131
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,731
Well, it's...

132
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,962
lt's just...

133
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:24,035
All right.
Tuesday night is tofu night.

134
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,439
And l'm asking myself, who decided
that everyone here likes tofu

135
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,104
in the first place?
And what is tofu, anyway?

136
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,376
And why can't l have bacon?
l line up every morning,

137
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,384
and l'm not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast.

138
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,613
And...
Let's talk about all the white.

139
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,883
Why is everyone
wearing white all the time?

140
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:44,620
lt's impossible to keep clean.
l always get the gray stripe.

141
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,390
l never get any color.
And l hand it in to be cleaned,

142
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:51,524
and someone cleans it, and folds it
neatly back in my drawer, but who?

143
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:54,468
Who is that person? l don't know.

144
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,265
l just... l wanna know answers.

145
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,102
And l wish that there was more.

146
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,174
- More?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:06,545
More than just waiting
to go to the lsland.

148
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:11,684
Lincoln,

149
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:14,587
it's your nature
to question things.

150
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:19,526
But don't you realize how lucky you are?
That you survived the contamination.

151
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:23,793
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

152
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:27,097
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

153
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:34,932
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to the lsland too?

154
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:37,444
No.

155
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:40,744
My responsibility is to make sure

156
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:43,114
this facility continues to operate.

157
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:48,817
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

158
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:51,553
...we can't win the lottery.

159
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,428
Let me see that.

160
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,365
You draw well.

161
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:03,405
''Renovatio.''
What does that mean?

162
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,736
l don't know.
lt's always in my dream.

163
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,545
l'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

164
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,780
What sort of tests?

165
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,209
Nice tests.

166
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,616
Come with me.

167
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,490
Take a seat.

168
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,593
OK, let's get you comfortable.

169
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,159
Swing back.

170
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:43,345
- l thought these were nice tests.
- lt's a synaptic brain scan.

171
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,607
Totally harmless.

172
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:48,650
Don't worry, it's painless.

173
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,129
- lt hurts.
- Not really.

174
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,935
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

175
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,340
Yeah, it really, really does!

176
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:23,680
The micro-sensors
will move along your optic nerve.

177
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:27,086
They'll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours,

178
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,852
after which,
you'll pass them through your urine.

179
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:32,052
Now, that might hurt.

180
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,067
Six Echo, you're late.

181
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:01,913
Jones, you ever get bored doing this?

182
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,219
- Doing what?
- This.

183
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:06,284
- l never really thought about it.
- l think about it a lot.

184
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,330
- About what?
- This boring job.

185
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:11,560
- What are we doing here?
- We're feeding the nutrient lines.

186
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:15,263
We eat food, food's gotta have
vitamins, right? lt's good for us.

187
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,999
You don't ever wonder about anything?

188
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,575
Where do these tubes go?

189
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:23,244
They start there.

190
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:26,247
And they go... right there.

191
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:30,384
Hey. Did you get a look
at the new guy?

192
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,512
Seven Foxtrot.

193
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:36,354
They found another survivor.
They keep finding them.

194
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,086
He'll probably win the lottery.

195
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,425
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go, you try it.

196
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:44,796
Straight down in the hole.

197
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:48,701
ln the hole.
No, no, no. Put it down.

198
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:52,205
Did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination?

199
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:56,802
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-The-Questions,
let me ask you this:

200
00:17:57,613 --> 00:17:59,808
Lottery's supposed
to be random, right?

201
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:00,974
Right.

202
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,382
What if it's not?
What if it's rigged?

203
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,279
Rigged?

204
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,848
l've been working on this. Here.

205
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,915
Take a look at that.

206
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:14,620
lt charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the lsland.

207
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:17,996
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

208
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:21,002
- What is this?
- l took the first letter in each name.

209
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:24,197
l assigned it a point value system,
based on the alphabet,

210
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,740
like the last guy,
Starkweather, S equals 15.

211
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,470
Q equals 15, S equals 19.

212
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,637
- Do you see what l'm saying?
- No.

213
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:34,205
Well, maybe if you would listen to me,
l'm trying to tell you.

214
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:37,684
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

215
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:41,154
You multiply... You divide it by
the amount of... You divide it...

216
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:45,717
You divide it by the amount of people,
which is 25, a thousand plus five, 2500.

217
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:49,560
You know what that spells?
J-O-N-E-S.

218
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,263
- l'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

219
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,170
- No.
- Gentlemen,

220
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:59,666
l'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

221
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,868
There you go. Straight.

222
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:04,241
Straight down in the hole.

223
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:06,178
- There you go.
- Straight...

224
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,345
- What? He had something on his... OK.
- Go.

225
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,454
Lima! Are you OK?
What's wrong?

226
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:21,155
Code 15, we need med-techs stat!
Lima One Alpha.

227
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,959
Let's give her some air, OK?

228
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,660
You're gonna be OK, all right?
Relax and breathe.

229
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,362
Can l get a wheelchair?
lt's for Lima One Alpha.

230
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,928
- You OK?
- l think it's time.

231
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,467
Lima, you're going to the lsland.

232
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,549
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

233
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:42,516
l hope l see you soon.

234
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:50,056
Everyone, please follow her out.
Quickly and carefully. Watch the glass.

235
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,252
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

236
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:59,066
That's fair. That's real fair.

237
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:02,592
Ladies, ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen. Thank you.

238
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,740
Everyone, back to work.

239
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:10,779
That is so not fair.

240
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:15,677
Oh, man, l hate this jealousy thing.
lt's giving me heart palpitations.

241
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,810
Tech Services.

242
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,683
Computer's down again.

243
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,614
l'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

244
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:26,092
l have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-Key. Contamination kit.

245
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,254
- Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

246
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,851
- Hey! What are you doing?
- l'm gonna see this guy.

247
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:04,897
Hey, chief. We got live wires
all over the place here.

248
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:08,198
Hey, l've been looking all over for you.

249
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:10,463
- What?
- l've been looking...

250
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:13,473
- Can't hear you.
- l've been looking all over for you.

251
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:17,945
lf you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

252
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:19,275
How you doing, Mac?

253
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:22,576
- What are you doing here?
- My chip fried again.

254
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,586
Yeah. How much longer
do you think that one's gonna work?

255
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,984
- What are you two clowns looking at?
- Hey,

256
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,119
you got any of that stuff
on you today?

257
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,559
Oh, look, it's break time.
Come on.

258
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,136
You're a bad influence on me.

259
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:44,138
Must be why l like you so much.

260
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,202
What's it like where you live?
ln Sector Five?

261
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:55,910
lt's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, l guess.

262
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:02,246
l like coming out here, talking.

263
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:04,986
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

264
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,186
Yeah.

265
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,821
Step into my office.

266
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:19,207
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

267
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:21,208
Where are their clothes?

268
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,573
What's with Dr. Merrick?

269
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:27,308
You mean why does he act like he's
got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

270
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:28,474
Yeah.

271
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,848
lt's called a God complex.

272
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,979
All doctors are like that.
They think they know everything.

273
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:36,183
What's God?

274
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:38,818
Well, you know when you
want something really bad

275
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:41,089
and you close your eyes
and you wish for it?

276
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:45,395
- God's the guy that ignores you.
- Oh. Right.

277
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:48,129
Tech Service requested
in Product Extraction.

278
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:50,398
Yeah, l'll be right there.

279
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,743
Oh, hey. Let me get that.

280
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,713
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

281
00:22:59,782 --> 00:23:02,580
lt's an old stash.
You know, from before.

282
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,744
You mean from
before the contamination?

283
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,051
Yeah. Come on, you're killing me
with questions here.

284
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:09,954
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

285
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:13,392
Because you're,
you know, like, special.

286
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:15,259
Why? Why am l special?

287
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,957
There's another question.

288
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,931
You remember what we talked about?

289
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,562
You don't tell anybody
about our conversations?

290
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:25,902
- 'Cause that can get me in big trouble.
- No, l don't.

291
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,475
Good.

292
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:06,744
How's it going?

293
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:12,414
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

294
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,248
OK, l'll catch you later.

295
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,319
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

296
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:22,795
Yep.

297
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:24,799
What a surprise.

298
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,635
Go hot.

299
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:35,910
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

300
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:38,945
You'd think with the money
this place rakes in

301
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:41,482
- they could afford decent equipment.
- Yeah.

302
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,147
Ready?

303
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:47,712
Cut the O2.

304
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,727
Seriously, unless you want to see me
blow chunks, can you wait till l'm gone?

305
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,888
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

306
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:20,517
Breathe.

307
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:24,115
Come on, yeah. That's it.

308
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:30,090
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

309
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:31,393
Come on.

310
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,365
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

311
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,836
There we go.
Now we're working.

312
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:39,737
He's healthy.

313
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:43,438
Welcome to the world.

314
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,242
So, how's Three Helo?

315
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:50,785
Good.

316
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,752
He's feisty. Light.

317
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,322
Vitals seem fine.

318
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:03,130
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

319
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,263
Looks like we have a fine product.

320
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,600
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

321
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:29,512
Little bug.

322
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:19,894
Maybe next time l won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

323
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:29,501
lt was very sad.

324
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:31,374
- Hey.
- Hello.

325
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:33,243
Hi.

326
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:37,618
So you just let
a little girl beat you, huh?

327
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:40,983
Stim units restricted.

328
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:43,081
Yeah, yeah.
l'll have the veggie stuff.

329
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:45,991
Papassian petal juice, please.

330
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:47,756
lt's good for the skin.

331
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,508
Jordan, are you sick?

332
00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:07,438
When l was in Dr. Merrick's office,
l thought l saw your name on a file.

333
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:09,211
No, l'm fine.

334
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:11,543
OK.

335
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,087
How are you?

336
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:16,249
l'm fine.

337
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:18,224
Lincoln, l can tell when you're lying

338
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:21,558
'cause your mouth smiles
but your eyes don't.

339
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:25,123
l found something.

340
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,462
- What?
- A bug.

341
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:28,797
- A bug?
- A flying bug.

342
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:29,871
Can l see it?

343
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:32,098
l think it came
in the ventilation shaft.

344
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:34,903
l thought they went extinct
with the contamination.

345
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,536
l know. And how did it get by
the pathogen sensors?

346
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:40,206
- lt must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

347
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:43,547
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

348
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:46,485
They keep finding people,
but where do they come from?

349
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:49,683
lt's good that they find survivors.

350
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:53,592
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

351
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:56,290
l just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

352
00:29:57,265 --> 00:29:59,631
Good things do happen.

353
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,965
l want to see that bug.

354
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:06,463
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

355
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:08,702
- What?
- ''Dude.''

356
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,209
''Dude''?

357
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:12,542
- What does it mean?
- He just called me dude.

358
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,707
- Hey, dude.
- He said ''Hey, dude''?

359
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,683
- D-O-O-D. ''Dude.''
- Hey, dude.

360
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,480
- Dude.
- Dude.

361
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:21,113
- Lottery's gonna start.
- Like you stand a chance.

362
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:22,178
Dude.

363
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:26,022
Light up all etherscreens.

364
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:29,359
And... start the lottery.

365
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,400
Good evening.

366
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:42,670
Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.

367
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,612
lt's been a busy week.

368
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,740
We've had a record two winners so far.

369
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:52,082
Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation

370
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:56,487
to the lsland, transported
to the world's last paradise.

371
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,857
- And start the spin.
- And now, let the spin begin.

372
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,331
Jordan Two Delta, step up.

373
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:13,339
Your time has come.
You're moving out to the lsland.

374
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:22,772
For everyone else, never lose hope.

375
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,353
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:30,186
l can't believe it.

377
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,433
l have to go in the morning.

378
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,493
You were right.

379
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:46,700
Good things do happen.

380
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:53,478
l wish l'd known you better.

381
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,377
You two.

382
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:57,884
Watch your proximity.

383
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:08,892
l'll see you on the lsland.

384
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:30,340
You want to go to the lsland.

385
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:36,688
Breathe!

386
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,717
You've been chosen.

387
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,924
The lsland awaits you.

388
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:07,104
Check into the nurses' station
up the corridor, take your first left.

389
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,078
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

390
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:13,382
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

391
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:18,481
She's so beautiful.

392
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:21,879
l've never seen a baby.

393
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:23,321
Can l hold her?

394
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,915
Notjust yet.

395
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,767
Are we going to the lsland?

396
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:53,437
Oh, my God.

397
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:56,417
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

398
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:58,282
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

399
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,321
lt's my baby. Oh, my gosh.

400
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:01,650
Whenever you're ready,

401
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:05,454
we have copies of your
policy termination for your records.

402
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,256
Look at her. She's beautiful.

403
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:14,398
Starkweather? That big, cute football
player on the Reebok commercials?

404
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,233
l love him! ls he in there?
l thought that was him, girl!

405
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:18,965
l just love him!

406
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:22,165
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

407
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,210
Any chance l can make this pickup?

408
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,576
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

409
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:30,948
Lady, l've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

410
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,318
We don't fly in bad weather.

411
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:40,588
They look real busy.
So l'd have a seat.

412
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:44,120
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

413
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:49,329
Heart rate 102.
BP 126 over 82.

414
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,428
- Laser cutter ready?

415
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,508
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

416
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:56,509
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

417
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:57,771
Prepare that bone saw.

418
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:02,375
l think we're about ready to open.

419
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,130
Let's clean that drip.

420
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,808
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

421
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:35,115
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

422
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,454
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP 138 over 92.

423
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,793
Heart rate's still rising.

424
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,057
- Boost the anesthetic level!
- He's fighting the ventilator.

425
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,655
l don't wanna euthanize this guy
to get his liver!

426
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,368
Guards!

427
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:04,777
Oh, my God!

428
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,886
Stop that man! Get him!

429
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,488
Stop!

430
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:42,174
All right, relax, relax, big guy.
Relax.

431
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,343
Easy, easy, easy!
Don't damage him!

432
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:49,446
- Relax!
- No!

433
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:52,049
l don't want to die, no! No!

434
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:55,994

00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:59,499
l wanna live!
l don't wanna die!

436
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,159
No!

437
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:04,938
Hey.

438
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:09,267
You OK, buddy? lt's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

439
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:12,471
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

440
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:25,554
Check this part out.

441
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,651
Wait, OK, watch.
Wait, wait.

442
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:31,459
Boom! Did you see that? Man.

443
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:34,092
That is so cruel, man.

444
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:37,599
Oh, man. Down for the count.

445
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:42,039
Gentlemen, l understand
there's been an incident.

446
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:45,101
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

447
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:47,773
- And do you find that funny?
- No, sir.

448
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,943
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

449
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:53,213
Play it back, please.

450
00:40:58,226 --> 00:41:00,091
Stop.

451
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:01,856
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

452
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,227
He was scared, l helped him up.

453
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,689
Play it back at half-speed.

454
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,168
Freeze.

455
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:17,742
Magnify his wrist.

456
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,515
We have a product on the loose.

457
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,187
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

458
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:30,781
- Let's go.
- OK, down to Level 2.

459
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,768
You can't come in here!

460
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:54,070
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,523
- How sweet.
- You gotta come with me.

462
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:14,590
What?

463
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:16,864
Move! Move!

464
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:28,382
We got a match!
Lincoln Six Echo.

465
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,815
l want a full contamination lockdown.

466
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:32,284
Find Six Echo.

467
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:36,722
- Masks down.
- What the hell?!

468
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:39,988
- l need to see all your faces.
- l don't care what he says, nurse,

469
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:42,962
that's live human tissue.
Seal that liver now.

470
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,725
Check the back corners!

471
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:53,203
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

472
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,400
Find out.

473
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,473
- Men aren't supposed to be...
- You gotta trust me.

474
00:43:00,548 --> 00:43:01,537
- What?
- l saw them.

475
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:03,913
- Who?
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.

476
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:06,545
- What?
- They killed her and cut him open...

477
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,588
Stop it!
l want to go back to my room.

478
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:11,557
- They're gonna kill you.
- l'm going to the lsland.

479
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,786
Jordan, there is no lsland!
Come on!

480
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:18,059
l got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

481
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,862
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

482
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:23,369
Get out of the way!

483
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:25,234
Move! Move!

484
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:27,432
Out of the way!
Get out. Now.

485
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:29,369
Just trust me.

486
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:36,115
This is a community bulletin.

487
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:37,912
Attention, residents,

488
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:42,081
a contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.

489
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:46,593
Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.

490
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:51,221
Move! Move!

491
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,797
Freeze! Stop right there!

492
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:18,989
Go! Go! Go!

493
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,152
Get out of the way!

494
00:44:29,236 --> 00:44:32,967
l've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

495
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,779
There they are!

496
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:53,418
l've got them in Sector Six basement!
Get them!

497
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:06,272
- No!
- Stop!

498
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:18,681
- Lincoln!
- Get up!

499
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:19,777
No!

500
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:22,282
Stop it!

501
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:25,389
No!

502
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:07,898
You've been chosen.
You have a very special purpose.

503
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:11,598
You're part of a new beginning.
You're special.

504
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,800
You have a very special purpose.

505
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:22,282
You want to go to the lsland.
Your purpose in life

506
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,319
is to populate the lsland.
You're part of a new beginning.

507
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:29,186
You're special. Very special.
You've been chosen.

508
00:46:29,257 --> 00:46:32,249
You've been chosen.
Chosen to survive, to carry on.

509
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:35,762
You want to go to the lsland.

510
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,266
- Go, go!
- You have a very special purpose.

511
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,271
Very special.

512
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,379
- He's gotta be in here.
- l'm looking!

513
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:54,437
Check over here!

514
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:55,880
Watch your left!

515
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,512
Run!

516
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,787
Go! Run!

517
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:05,348
He's over here!

518
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:14,427
There they are! Go!

519
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:31,309
- Lincoln!
- Come on! Get him!

520
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,080
- Let s go. Move!
- Come on!

521
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:38,685
Come on! Come on!

522
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:41,387
Damn! Go, go! Go!

523
00:47:41,462 --> 00:47:43,123
Come on, let's go!

524
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48,796
You still think there's an lsland?

525
00:47:59,747 --> 00:48:01,112
Come on!

526
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:29,041
Come on. Come on!

527
00:48:46,294 --> 00:48:48,819
There's a door over here!

528
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:09,307
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.

529
00:50:09,377 --> 00:50:14,713
Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on the lsland.

530
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:17,751
Jones Three Echo, l need you
to concentrate in this lab.

531
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:21,515
Sir, l want to focus more than anything.
l love my job. lt's interesting.

532
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:24,717
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated,

533
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:27,852
and it really worries me,
because he's a good friend of mine.

534
00:50:27,928 --> 00:50:30,396
He's one of my best friends.
My only best friend.

535
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:32,591
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

536
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:34,861
Sir, l have one question.

537
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:37,062
Where do all the tubes go?

538
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,440
The human organism.

539
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:44,478
Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.

540
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:47,480
The product of three billion years
of evolution.

541
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:51,006
Perfect in every way, except one.

542
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:53,576
Like all machines, it wears out.

543
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:58,019
For centuries, the idea
of replenishing the human body

544
00:50:58,092 --> 00:51:00,219
has been
at the forefront of science.

545
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:02,455
We need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

546
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,361
- How?
- A terrific day. By selling.

547
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:07,458
By selling. Sell, sell, sell.
You start, l finish.

548
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:19,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

549
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,616
welcome to
the next generation of science,

550
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,652
the agnate.

551
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,849
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood

552
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,721
to match the client's age.

553
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:34,317
- You're looking at stage one
- This way, sir.

554
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:35,794
in its development.

555
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:38,525
Within 12 months
it will be harvest-ready,

556
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:42,262
providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.

557
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:46,500
All genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

558
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:51,374
And, in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015,

559
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:56,610
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

560
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:59,084
They never achieve consciousness.

561
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:02,384
They never think or suffer

562
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:06,483
or feel pain, joy, love, hate.

563
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,393
lt's a product, ladies and gentlemen,

564
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:12,227
in every way that matters,

565
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:15,097
not human.

566
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,434
This is our public relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

567
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,636
He'll be happy
to answer any questions.

568
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:27,213
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

569
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:31,341
l want to talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

570
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:36,013
And l want to tell you how you're
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.

571
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,393
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

572
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:47,195
You come highly recommended
by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

573
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:50,101
Though l'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

574
00:52:50,171 --> 00:52:53,004
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

575
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:55,871
l was formerly with the GlGN,
French Special Forces.

576
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:58,240
l understand you had a corporate theft.

577
00:52:58,312 --> 00:53:00,746
Yes, that's what l told
the Defense Department.

578
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:04,773
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why l require your services.

579
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,980
We've had a... security breach.

580
00:53:08,055 --> 00:53:11,752
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

581
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:14,419
Because their
investment here is sizeable.

582
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:17,794
One hundred and twenty
billion dollars, to be exact.

583
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,800
And l can't afford
for them to reconsider.

584
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:23,132
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

585
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:26,139
l am in the business
of keeping my clients' confidence.

586
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,707
Good.

587
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:34,511
Two of our products have escaped.

588
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:37,574
lmpressive,
considering they're vegetative.

589
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:40,518
Well, after several years
of trial and error,

590
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,954
we discovered that
without consciousness,

591
00:53:43,023 --> 00:53:48,461
without human experience,
emotion, without life,

592
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:50,827
the organs failed.

593
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:54,525
How long have they been missing?

594
00:53:54,602 --> 00:53:57,366
Four hours and 36 minutes.

595
00:53:57,438 --> 00:54:00,202
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

596
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:04,175
Wade, 1 .2 miles an hour,
five mile perimeter,

597
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:07,339
- standby for suspect description.
- We're on it.

598
00:54:07,448 --> 00:54:08,881
Follow me.

599
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:29,293
- Come on, we gotta keep going.
- l have to stop. l can't run anymore.

600
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,667
- You gotta try.
- Where?

601
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:33,413
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

602
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:36,288
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

603
00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:44,332
What if we are contaminated?

604
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:46,995
Then we'd be dead.

605
00:54:47,771 --> 00:54:50,467
There's no contamination.
lt was a lie.

606
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:04,619
- What is it?
- l don't know.

607
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:06,349
But it's alive.

608
00:55:10,994 --> 00:55:13,986
Come on. lt's mean, whatever it is.

609
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:15,359
Let's rest in here.

610
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:18,196
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor,
Sarah Jordan, is in a coma

611
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:21,431
after a car accident.
She's in need of multiple transplants.

612
00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:23,234
How long does she have?

613
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:25,775
Forty-eight hours.
Three days maximum.

614
00:55:25,843 --> 00:55:27,572
Tell me about Six Echo.

615
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:31,045
He was really the first one
to question his environment,

616
00:55:31,114 --> 00:55:32,638
his whole existence here.

617
00:55:32,716 --> 00:55:36,914
Over the last few months,
he began demonstrating unstable behavior

618
00:55:36,987 --> 00:55:39,820
and l can't account for it.

619
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:42,391
l'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

620
00:55:42,493 --> 00:55:44,893
What do they know
about the outside world?

621
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:46,896
Very little.

622
00:55:46,964 --> 00:55:50,058
We control them with
the memory of a shared event.

623
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:54,502
A global contamination.
lt keeps them fearful of going outside.

624
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:59,133
The lsland is the one thing
that gives them hope,

625
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:01,234
gives them purpose.

626
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,042
Everything we expose them to,

627
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:07,743
their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play,

628
00:56:07,818 --> 00:56:11,447
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

629
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:14,013
To avoid obvious complications,

630
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:16,752
they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

631
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,193
We find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether.

632
00:56:20,697 --> 00:56:26,033
ln a very real sense...
they're like children.

633
00:56:26,103 --> 00:56:28,799
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

634
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:49,356
- What was that?
- l don't know.

635
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:52,456
But l want one.

636
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:08,806
Look!

637
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:12,945
Route 39. Route 39.

638
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,007
Come on.

639
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:17,246
l got it from a friend.

640
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,104
l think that's it.

641
00:58:15,712 --> 00:58:16,838
What's up?

642
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:19,575
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

643
00:58:21,218 --> 00:58:23,413
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

644
00:58:24,287 --> 00:58:28,087
- l am.
- And you would be who?

645
00:58:28,191 --> 00:58:31,251
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

646
00:58:32,562 --> 00:58:34,393
Right.

647
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:37,331
Y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?

648
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:40,495
- U... What? No, l don't think so.
- No.

649
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,764
McCord?

650
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:44,272
Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.
He's in the can.

651
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:46,741
- He's in a can?
- Taking a dump.

652
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,607
A dump? Taking it where?

653
00:58:51,248 --> 00:58:53,580
Bubba, you're fixing
to get on my nerves.

654
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,881
- lt's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

655
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:00,013
l have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

656
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:03,115
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

657
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:05,217
Straight up?

658
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:18,538
Oh, that is bitchin'.

659
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:22,608
So this is Sector Five?

660
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:24,977
Hey! You son of a bitch!

661
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,479
You knew!

662
00:59:28,552 --> 00:59:31,783
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

663
00:59:31,855 --> 00:59:33,686
They're gonna be looking for you.

664
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,987
- Tell me what's going on!
- lf anybody sees us together,

665
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:39,187
both of us are gonna be dead.

666
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:42,163
So, will you just
take your hands off me? Let me...

667
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:46,532
Let me pull my pants up
and l'll take you back to my place

668
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:48,400
so we can be alone. OK?

669
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:54,877
- Ed.
- Mac.

670
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:58,179
Give you... give you boys a minute?

671
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:02,174
What?
This isn't what it looks like.

672
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:06,549
Sure. Sure.

673
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:08,556
Get out of here, you stupid...

674
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,786
Will you stop?

675
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:15,665
You can'tjust bust in on a guy
like that. That's really rude.

676
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,360
She doesn't understand the licking.

677
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:21,836
You a knucklehead?
You brought another one?

678
01:00:21,905 --> 01:00:23,964
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

679
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,474
Back off, Joe, OK?
Don't push me!

680
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:28,067
No, no, no, that's no good.

681
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:29,669
Put it on my tab.
We gotta go.

682
01:00:29,746 --> 01:00:32,271
Friends from out of town.
Come on, sweetheart.

683
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:34,180
- Give me your number.
- Two Delta.

684
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:36,947
Hey, look. Get...
Don't test me.

685
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,988
Don't.

686
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:53,531
Well, this is nice.

687
01:00:56,373 --> 01:00:59,274
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the lnstitute.

688
01:00:59,342 --> 01:01:01,742
Do y'all work with him?

689
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:05,905
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

690
01:01:05,982 --> 01:01:08,382
Those are fancy tracksuits.

691
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:12,182
Y'all exercise out in this heat,
gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.

692
01:01:13,156 --> 01:01:16,785
Oh, Mac, look.
They got matching bracelets.

693
01:01:16,893 --> 01:01:20,829
- We should do that, honey.
- Suzie...

694
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:24,025
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

695
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:26,495
Yeah.

696
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,937
Actually, would you run down to Red's
and pick us up a sixer of Bud?

697
01:01:30,006 --> 01:01:33,339
- We've got to talk shop.
- OK, baby.

698
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,742
- Just making friends.
- l know. Good. Just...

699
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:37,074
Bye.

700
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:44,852
Why do they lie, Mac?

701
01:01:44,921 --> 01:01:47,583
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

702
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:53,254
To keep you
from knowing what you are.

703
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:57,693
- What we are?
- What are we?

704
01:01:57,767 --> 01:02:01,794
Man, why do l gotta be the guy
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

705
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:08,306
OK, look. You're...

706
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:12,977
Well, you're not like me.

707
01:02:14,784 --> 01:02:17,981
l mean, you're not... human.

708
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:23,586
l mean, you're human,
but you just, you're not real.

709
01:02:23,693 --> 01:02:27,561
You're not,
like, a real person. Like me.

710
01:02:30,734 --> 01:02:33,066
You're clones.

711
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:38,939
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

712
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,636
- What?
- Clones?

713
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,905
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

714
01:02:42,979 --> 01:02:46,346
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a facelift

715
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,577
or one of 'em gets sick
and need a new part,

716
01:02:48,652 --> 01:02:50,984
they take it from you.

717
01:02:52,656 --> 01:02:55,887
But l have a mother.
l remember her.

718
01:02:55,992 --> 01:02:58,051
- Yeah, l know.
- l grew up on a farm.

719
01:02:58,161 --> 01:03:00,186
l have a little dog and l had a bike.

720
01:03:00,297 --> 01:03:01,821
And a bike. Right.

721
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:05,333
lt was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars

722
01:03:05,402 --> 01:03:07,597
and you rode it
to your grandmother's.

723
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:10,936
You ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies.

724
01:03:11,007 --> 01:03:12,338
Yeah.

725
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:16,607
No. Memory imprints.
l seen them.

726
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,877
A buddy of mine is a programmer
at the lnstitute. He showed me.

727
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:23,545
There's only 12 stories.
They change around little details,

728
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,850
but they're all pretty much the same.

729
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:31,360
The life you think you had
before the ''contamination,''

730
01:03:31,428 --> 01:03:33,862
it never happened.

731
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:38,760
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

732
01:03:38,835 --> 01:03:42,999
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood, be my guest.

733
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:44,631
How long?

734
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:47,370
How long have we been alive?

735
01:03:48,545 --> 01:03:51,480
You're Echo generation,
so you're three.

736
01:03:53,149 --> 01:03:54,673
Delta means you're four.

737
01:03:57,187 --> 01:03:58,415
Three?

738
01:03:58,488 --> 01:04:02,447
The whole reason you exist is
'cause everyone wants to live forever.

739
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,390
lt's the new American dream.

740
01:04:04,461 --> 01:04:07,953
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

741
01:04:08,064 --> 01:04:11,556
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

742
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:15,900
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.

743
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:20,500
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

744
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:24,308
He doesn't want anybody knowing
the truth, especially not sponsors.

745
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:28,249
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

746
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:30,479
They, like, own you.

747
01:04:32,555 --> 01:04:38,460
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

748
01:04:38,528 --> 01:04:43,261
Just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

749
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:47,864
Besides, do you know
how many laws Merrick's breaking

750
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:50,167
to have you two hatched?

751
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,239
Your sponsors
can't have any part of that.

752
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,710
They're like high society,
rich and famous.

753
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,305
lf they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

754
01:04:59,382 --> 01:05:02,010
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the truth.

755
01:05:02,085 --> 01:05:03,450
- What?
- Yeah.

756
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,613
No, that's the worst idea l ever heard.

757
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:08,179
You know how dead l'd be?
Not to mention fired?

758
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,623
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

759
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:13,662
Stop, stop! Fold, stop.
Brakes. No. Come on.

760
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:16,460
You're the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

761
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:19,832
They're not gonna care.
What? They're gonna care?

762
01:05:19,903 --> 01:05:21,234
You know what l would do?

763
01:05:21,304 --> 01:05:24,671
l would just get as far away
from here as l could.

764
01:05:24,741 --> 01:05:25,969
Go to the beach.

765
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:29,205
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

766
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:31,213
We're asking for your help.

767
01:05:32,782 --> 01:05:34,613
Oh, God.

768
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:47,419
lnfrared's having a hard time picking up
a heat signature. Sand's too hot.

769
01:05:51,634 --> 01:05:54,262
He was implanted
with micro-sensors yesterday.

770
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:58,205
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

771
01:05:58,274 --> 01:06:01,573
- lf we can get within half a mile.
- Do it.

772
01:06:01,644 --> 01:06:04,442
Your sponsors names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

773
01:06:04,514 --> 01:06:06,175
Her sponsor lives in New York.

774
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:09,275
The number in your name
is a regional code.

775
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:13,652
Six Echo, that means
your sponsor lives in LA.

776
01:06:13,756 --> 01:06:15,883
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state?

777
01:06:15,992 --> 01:06:17,482
Put this on.

778
01:06:17,594 --> 01:06:20,586
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

779
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:23,427
Keep going. What size?

780
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:25,800
All right.

781
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:28,030
These are bags, OK?
You put stuff in 'em.

782
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:30,868
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

783
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,430
We're not idiots.

784
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:35,967
Excuse me, Miss ''l'm so smart
l can't wait to go to the lsland.''

785
01:06:39,582 --> 01:06:41,607
Yeah. Good.

786
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:48,185
Wait. Hold, hold, hold.

787
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,759
People don't really
wear these on the outside.

788
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,420
These are mail-order, OK?
These stay here.

789
01:06:56,332 --> 01:07:00,268
No. Mail-order, OK?
Clones don't wear these.

790
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,337
All right, listen up.

791
01:07:05,408 --> 01:07:08,468
This card is like stim credits, OK?

792
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:11,514
lt'll get you food, but l gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours

793
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:15,677
or else they'll know l helped you.
After that, use the cash.

794
01:07:18,755 --> 01:07:19,847
All right, look.

795
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:22,948
l know you're new to this
whole human experience and all,

796
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:24,754
but there's one universal truth

797
01:07:24,861 --> 01:07:27,625
and that is you never
give a woman your credit card.

798
01:07:28,398 --> 01:07:30,389
Right.

799
01:07:36,372 --> 01:07:38,067
l got something. lt's hot.

800
01:07:48,718 --> 01:07:51,278
Oh, God.

801
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:56,149
- Train four...
- Train'll be here. Hustle.

802
01:07:56,226 --> 01:07:59,787
...to Sacramento
is now boarding at platform A.

803
01:07:59,862 --> 01:08:03,662
All right, stay. All right?
Just stay. Don't move.

804
01:08:04,801 --> 01:08:06,268
Mama!

805
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:12,041
Look at that!

806
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:14,372
Those are kids.

807
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,703
Wow.

808
01:08:23,419 --> 01:08:26,877
Come here. The train is non-stop to LA.
You need these to get on.

809
01:08:26,956 --> 01:08:30,619
When you get there, look up your
sponsors in the information directory.

810
01:08:30,693 --> 01:08:32,160
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

811
01:08:32,228 --> 01:08:36,028
- What is an information directory?
- lt'll tell you where they live.

812
01:08:36,132 --> 01:08:39,101
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

813
01:08:39,168 --> 01:08:43,264
One thing l can tell you about people,
is that they'll do anything to survive.

814
01:08:43,339 --> 01:08:45,307
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

815
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:48,109
Thanks a lot.

816
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:51,738
All right. l'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

817
01:08:51,814 --> 01:08:54,180
Better not get me in trouble.

818
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:08,353
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, that's a good one.

819
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:18,204
l think l got an lD.
Two in the center.

820
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,108
Run!

821
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:03,607
Run!

822
01:11:06,453 --> 01:11:07,613
God!

823
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:15,353
Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform C.

824
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,569
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

825
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:40,886
- This was supposed to be a simple job?
- lt's never simple.

826
01:11:40,954 --> 01:11:42,615
We got a missing credit card.

827
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:47,126
McCord just used it to buy train tickets
and it's not in his wallet.

828
01:11:47,193 --> 01:11:51,425
Monitor the account. Have Amtrak
patch you through to the conductor.

829
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:54,430
Get me a new team in LA.

830
01:11:57,237 --> 01:12:00,172
- Got here as fast as l could.
- Come here.

831
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,437
l finished scanning the Defense
Department Troop Selections,

832
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:06,138
- if you want to see them...
- Not yet. Look at that.

833
01:12:07,914 --> 01:12:10,974
- Six Echo drew it.
- lt's elaborate.

834
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:15,283
''Renovachio.'' Renovatee-oh?

835
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:17,880
Renovatio.
What is that, ltalian?

836
01:12:17,957 --> 01:12:19,948
lt's Latin.

837
01:12:20,393 --> 01:12:22,588
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

838
01:12:22,662 --> 01:12:24,960
Yes, l'm well aware of that.

839
01:12:25,832 --> 01:12:28,198
So where did he learn it?

840
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:30,292
Where are the results from his scan?

841
01:12:30,403 --> 01:12:34,271
- They'll be back from Johns Hopkins...
- Just speed it up.

842
01:12:34,341 --> 01:12:35,399
Yes, sir.

843
01:12:48,455 --> 01:12:49,444
You two.

844
01:12:49,522 --> 01:12:51,956
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please,

845
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:55,119
train number 1 7
leaving for San Diego...

846
01:12:55,195 --> 01:12:57,755
- There!
- ...was delayed 20 minutes. Stand by.

847
01:14:46,406 --> 01:14:50,035
We just arrived, but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

848
01:14:57,116 --> 01:15:00,711
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

849
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:02,311
Thanks.

850
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:10,896
Wilshire. 5th. Grand.

851
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:15,901
Spring. Grand Avenue?
Smile for the camera, sweetheart.

852
01:15:24,177 --> 01:15:27,510
Where is Flower?
You on Flower?

853
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:30,981
Olive, Olive.
Come on, come on.

854
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,109
You look familiar.

855
01:15:33,686 --> 01:15:34,846
Gotcha.

856
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,758
Three Black Wasps
and two jet bikes.

857
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:42,317
We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

858
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:44,590
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

859
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,192
We're moving! Let's go.

860
01:16:01,915 --> 01:16:03,940
Wait. Got a hit
on McCord's credit card.

861
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:06,577
Location, Grand Avenue at 9830.

862
01:16:06,653 --> 01:16:09,417
Team, proceed immediately to 9830.

863
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:13,550
No, no, no. LAPD's moving in.
They've flagged McCord's credit card.

864
01:16:13,626 --> 01:16:16,789
- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.

865
01:16:18,097 --> 01:16:21,464
- Not listed.
- Sarah Jordan.

866
01:16:28,308 --> 01:16:29,434
Hello?

867
01:16:29,509 --> 01:16:32,569
Yes, l'm looking for Sarah Jordan.

868
01:16:33,212 --> 01:16:35,612
She's sick.

869
01:16:35,682 --> 01:16:39,812
- Can l talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.

870
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:42,286
Mommy, is that you?

871
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:00,469
Jordan. Let's go!

872
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,809
Freeze! Put your hands up!

873
01:17:04,877 --> 01:17:07,277
- Keep your hands off!
- Put your hands up!

874
01:17:07,347 --> 01:17:09,338
Do as l say! Do as l say!

875
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,948
- Lincoln.
- Just do what they say.

876
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:14,486
Lincoln.

877
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:15,748
- Pull back.
- Move out.

878
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:17,483
What's going on?

879
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:28,596
Nail it! Quick, move!

880
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:42,511
We're detaining you in connection
to the murder of James McCord.

881
01:17:42,582 --> 01:17:45,745
- What? He was my friend!
- Anything you say can and will be used

882
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:48,514
- against you in a court of law.
- What's a court of law?

883
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,390
They'll run DNA.
lf the agnates are booked,

884
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:58,487
it'll implicate your clients
in a murder investigation.

885
01:17:58,564 --> 01:17:59,792
This is a nightmare.

886
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:02,800
You cannot allow this to happen.
Do you understand me?

887
01:18:02,869 --> 01:18:05,269
You use any force that is necessary.

888
01:18:05,338 --> 01:18:07,898
l'm ordering you
to contain the situation.

889
01:18:08,007 --> 01:18:11,238
1-Adam-82, we've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults, no lD.

890
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,972
Notify Forensics,
we'll need DNA typing.

891
01:18:14,047 --> 01:18:16,515
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

892
01:18:16,582 --> 01:18:19,779
- Could you look up my file, please?
- Sit back.

893
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:37,397
Dispatch, we're two minutes out.

894
01:18:47,146 --> 01:18:49,205
- Check inside!
- Hey, can you hear me?

895
01:18:49,282 --> 01:18:52,376
Lincoln, get up!
Get up, Lincoln! Get up!

896
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:00,185
Let's go!

897
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,623
Go! Go! Go!

898
01:19:03,429 --> 01:19:04,521
Go!

899
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:09,894
We got cops. We got cops!

900
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,941
Get down!

901
01:19:26,419 --> 01:19:28,387
Run!

902
01:19:29,088 --> 01:19:31,716
l see them! Let's get moving!

903
01:19:32,992 --> 01:19:35,722
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

904
01:19:36,662 --> 01:19:38,061
Move, move!

905
01:19:38,131 --> 01:19:39,962
Move out! Move out!

906
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,573
Come on!

907
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,116
Go, go, go, go! Go!

908
01:20:15,168 --> 01:20:17,102
Shit! Check up here!

909
01:20:18,304 --> 01:20:19,737
Come on!

910
01:20:55,942 --> 01:20:59,070
Air-Two, give me status of the targets.

911
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:03,043
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently, take them out.

912
01:21:06,018 --> 01:21:07,076
Go!

913
01:21:09,956 --> 01:21:11,753
Move! Go, go!

914
01:21:11,824 --> 01:21:13,382
- l can't fit!
- Move back!

915
01:21:13,459 --> 01:21:14,721
l can't fit!

916
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:34,569
Look out, look out!

917
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:42,252
Right, right, right!

918
01:21:57,003 --> 01:21:58,027
Stay on them!

919
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:01,773
Look out!

920
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:09,009
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

921
01:22:31,737 --> 01:22:33,500
Good job!

922
01:22:34,941 --> 01:22:38,377
We've gotta bail out of here,
there's police choppers inbound.

923
01:22:47,053 --> 01:22:48,953
Black Wasp, take out the truck!

924
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:01,894
Troy, you all right? Let's go!

925
01:23:06,672 --> 01:23:07,696
Cops! Cops!

926
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,827
He's coming back!

927
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:36,729
Stay down, Jordan!

928
01:24:04,964 --> 01:24:08,422
- How do you know what you're doing?
- l don't know!

929
01:25:07,426 --> 01:25:08,723
Hold on!

930
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:11,823
Look out!

931
01:25:19,205 --> 01:25:20,433
Look out!

932
01:25:28,047 --> 01:25:30,311
Hold on!

933
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,135
- Don't let me go, Lincoln!
- l got you! l got you!

934
01:25:51,203 --> 01:25:53,330
- Don't let me go!
- l got you!

935
01:25:54,073 --> 01:25:57,474
l'm slipping!
Don't drop me, Lincoln!

936
01:25:57,576 --> 01:26:00,875
- Don't drop me!
- l got you! l got you!

937
01:26:03,983 --> 01:26:07,111
Lincoln! Pull me! Pull me!

938
01:26:08,954 --> 01:26:11,047
Climb up!

939
01:26:14,059 --> 01:26:16,789
lf there's no way to get
our fugitives quietly,

940
01:26:16,862 --> 01:26:19,126
you need to take them out.

941
01:26:22,368 --> 01:26:24,598
l see our targets about 70 stories up.

942
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:27,103
They're on top of the building logo.

943
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:32,271
Tough day.

944
01:26:32,945 --> 01:26:34,378
Let's roll.

945
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:38,245
LAPD! Get away from the window!

946
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:43,713
Jay, you got him?

947
01:26:45,424 --> 01:26:47,358
Right there! Right there!
Get him!

948
01:26:55,868 --> 01:26:58,860
Stay there! Damn it!
Just stay down!

949
01:26:59,438 --> 01:27:00,996
Come on!

950
01:27:04,643 --> 01:27:07,305
Gonna swing around to get a shot.

951
01:27:13,385 --> 01:27:14,750
He's coming back.

952
01:27:30,869 --> 01:27:32,029
Oh, no.

953
01:27:35,774 --> 01:27:38,208
Hang on!
They're coming off the building.

954
01:28:04,637 --> 01:28:06,468
Look out!

955
01:28:21,954 --> 01:28:23,478
Jesus must love you!

956
01:28:23,555 --> 01:28:25,921
That was the craziest mess
l ever seen!

957
01:28:25,991 --> 01:28:29,654
Come on, girl.
l know Jesus loves you.

958
01:28:39,672 --> 01:28:42,334
Can you keep a secret, doc?

959
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:44,035
Why, yes, of course.

960
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:46,373
There is something
going on around here.

961
01:28:46,445 --> 01:28:48,743
Something you may
not even know about.

962
01:28:48,814 --> 01:28:49,872
What is it?

963
01:28:49,948 --> 01:28:55,147
Well, l'm not sure that
the contamination is real.

964
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,211
- Why do you think that?
- OK.

965
01:28:57,289 --> 01:29:02,192
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

966
01:29:02,261 --> 01:29:03,785
- Wow.
- Right.

967
01:29:03,862 --> 01:29:06,763
And l think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

968
01:29:06,832 --> 01:29:09,494
Have you told
anyone else about this?

969
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:13,537
No, no. But l'm gonna do some digging.
l'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

970
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:16,369
And when l do,
l'll share my information with you.

971
01:29:16,442 --> 01:29:18,103
Thank you.

972
01:29:18,177 --> 01:29:20,407
l want to be helpful.
l like it here.

973
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:22,276
Good.

974
01:29:22,348 --> 01:29:24,816
But l really want to look
into the lottery too.

975
01:29:24,883 --> 01:29:27,977
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

976
01:29:28,053 --> 01:29:29,884
You know,

977
01:29:29,955 --> 01:29:32,515
you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

978
01:29:32,591 --> 01:29:34,786
You're very smart.

979
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,556
Yeah. l remember
when l first came here.

980
01:29:40,265 --> 01:29:42,961
A survivor, just like you.

981
01:29:43,068 --> 01:29:45,662
One of the first, in fact.

982
01:29:45,771 --> 01:29:49,707
lt's natural, even healthy,
to question the world we're presented.

983
01:29:49,808 --> 01:29:53,244
You might say it's only...
only human.

984
01:29:55,714 --> 01:29:58,239
Oh, that burns!

985
01:30:00,018 --> 01:30:03,749
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

986
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,908
l saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

987
01:30:24,009 --> 01:30:26,910
We'll go there when the rain stops.

988
01:30:27,546 --> 01:30:30,674
- lt'll be OK when we find him.
- OK.

989
01:30:36,221 --> 01:30:39,156
That little boy looked like me.

990
01:30:42,294 --> 01:30:44,660
His mom's gonna die, isn't she?

991
01:30:45,798 --> 01:30:47,493
l don't know.

992
01:30:50,369 --> 01:30:52,030
You're lying.

993
01:30:59,778 --> 01:31:01,746
lt's cold.

994
01:31:51,663 --> 01:31:52,857
Go in.

995
01:31:53,599 --> 01:31:54,930
l can't.

996
01:31:55,767 --> 01:31:59,259
- l'll go in.
- Jordan. Jordan!

997
01:32:02,908 --> 01:32:04,705
Hello?

998
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:09,310
Hello?

999
01:32:57,062 --> 01:32:58,723
Lincoln!

1000
01:33:15,847 --> 01:33:18,111
Oh, my God.

1001
01:33:20,385 --> 01:33:23,149
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

1002
01:33:23,221 --> 01:33:25,985
l'm your insurance policy.

1003
01:33:40,939 --> 01:33:43,669
And what are you doing in my house?

1004
01:33:48,714 --> 01:33:50,443
Sir, sir.

1005
01:33:51,216 --> 01:33:55,209
You need to see this.
lt's a... lt's...

1006
01:33:55,954 --> 01:33:57,148
lt's beautiful.

1007
01:33:57,222 --> 01:34:00,055
This is a synaptic scan
we took of Six Echo three years ago,

1008
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:03,117
before we integrated him
into the agnate population. OK?

1009
01:34:03,195 --> 01:34:07,131
This is his scan from a few days ago.
You can see how much the memory's grown.

1010
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,657
Like he's experienced 30 years,
not three, which is impossible.

1011
01:34:10,769 --> 01:34:14,762
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't...

1012
01:34:14,873 --> 01:34:19,037
An infection can't teach you Latin,
or how to fly.

1013
01:34:25,817 --> 01:34:28,115
They are memories.

1014
01:34:29,855 --> 01:34:32,050
But they're not his.

1015
01:34:33,659 --> 01:34:36,389
They belong to his sponsor.

1016
01:34:36,461 --> 01:34:38,429
l've seen you before.

1017
01:34:39,498 --> 01:34:41,989
l've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...

1018
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,866
- Maxim?
- Oh, they're men's magazines.

1019
01:34:45,937 --> 01:34:51,000
Pictures of women
with little, tight, short...

1020
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:54,944
...stories too.
Anyway, you're very popular.

1021
01:34:57,783 --> 01:34:59,648
There we are.

1022
01:35:00,952 --> 01:35:02,419
What is that?

1023
01:35:02,487 --> 01:35:04,682
That looks like some kind of thermal...

1024
01:35:07,559 --> 01:35:10,528
Boy, your skin is so soft.

1025
01:35:10,595 --> 01:35:12,722
Did you know?

1026
01:35:17,436 --> 01:35:20,428
l put some clothes
out for you upstairs.

1027
01:35:20,539 --> 01:35:23,702
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1028
01:35:33,618 --> 01:35:35,882
l keep expecting to wake up.

1029
01:35:35,954 --> 01:35:38,320
l thought l was taller.

1030
01:35:38,757 --> 01:35:42,124
l'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

1031
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:46,028
She is unbelievable.

1032
01:35:46,098 --> 01:35:49,727
How is it you've been around three
years and end up with the kind of woman

1033
01:35:49,835 --> 01:35:52,565
l haven't been able to find
my whole life? Give me that.

1034
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:56,232
She found me.
She's my best friend.

1035
01:35:56,308 --> 01:35:59,709
- Why do we sound different?
- l'm from Scotland.

1036
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:01,871
l'm from Scotland.

1037
01:36:01,947 --> 01:36:04,916
Hey, look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

1038
01:36:04,983 --> 01:36:08,248
- Without that.
- No, really, cut it out.

1039
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,311
That's enough.

1040
01:36:10,388 --> 01:36:13,084
Yeah, that is enough.
l'm sorry.

1041
01:36:13,725 --> 01:36:15,716
Like a freak show.

1042
01:36:15,794 --> 01:36:17,853
Yeah, it's weird.

1043
01:36:20,332 --> 01:36:25,395
- So, you build boats?
- l design them. l draw them, yeah.

1044
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:27,738
Here.

1045
01:36:27,806 --> 01:36:32,573
l started off with cars, motorcycles.
Experimental designs.

1046
01:36:32,644 --> 01:36:35,977
Anything that blew my hair back.
Kind of a speed freak, you know?

1047
01:36:36,047 --> 01:36:38,515
- Petrol-head.
- Motorcycles, wow.

1048
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:42,519
- l feel like l've seen these before.
- lt's something l've always done.

1049
01:36:42,587 --> 01:36:44,919
l never dreamt it would make me rich.

1050
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:46,582
What's Renovatio?

1051
01:36:46,658 --> 01:36:49,456
''Renovatio'' in Latin means rebirth.

1052
01:36:49,528 --> 01:36:51,359
Subtle, eh?

1053
01:36:51,863 --> 01:36:55,856
Look. l have cirrhotic hepatitis.

1054
01:36:55,967 --> 01:36:58,868
A parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

1055
01:36:59,371 --> 01:37:01,032
What?

1056
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:03,937
Lots and lots of sex.

1057
01:37:05,043 --> 01:37:08,012
- Sex?
- Sex with...

1058
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:11,005
You've... You're a virgin?

1059
01:37:12,551 --> 01:37:16,282
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

1060
01:37:17,823 --> 01:37:22,522
OK, l'm not gonna spoil the surprise,
but, boy, are you in for a treat.

1061
01:37:22,594 --> 01:37:26,655
Look, my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

1062
01:37:31,169 --> 01:37:34,730
l'm not good at all this shite,
you know? Confessions and regret.

1063
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,034
Look.

1064
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:42,443
There are people who are following us.

1065
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:45,972
They're trying to kill us.
The reason we came is we need your help.

1066
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:47,211
Help you do what?

1067
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:49,515
To show people
what the lnstitute does.

1068
01:37:50,155 --> 01:37:53,090
But who'd believe it?
l'm looking at you and l don't.

1069
01:37:53,725 --> 01:37:57,593
Who is that guy? l know him.
ls he the Community Announcer?

1070
01:37:57,662 --> 01:37:59,289
He's the President of America.

1071
01:37:59,364 --> 01:38:02,128
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

1072
01:38:02,234 --> 01:38:03,997
Yeah, l never liked him, either.

1073
01:38:04,102 --> 01:38:06,866
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

1074
01:38:06,938 --> 01:38:09,236
Then if we can get
on there together,

1075
01:38:09,307 --> 01:38:11,298
people will see us and know the truth.

1076
01:38:11,409 --> 01:38:14,003
So the idea is that we both
just waltz down to NBC

1077
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:16,547
and see if they can slot us in
after the weather.

1078
01:38:16,615 --> 01:38:20,813
This might not mean anything to you,
but there are thousands of us.

1079
01:38:20,886 --> 01:38:23,719
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

1080
01:38:31,029 --> 01:38:32,894
Help us.

1081
01:38:35,634 --> 01:38:38,762
All right.
Let me just get my shoes, OK?

1082
01:38:57,589 --> 01:39:00,114
Tom, hurry up!

1083
01:39:03,895 --> 01:39:05,760
Merrick lnstitute.

1084
01:39:06,998 --> 01:39:09,990
- Merrick Biotech. How may l help you?
- This is Tom Lincoln.

1085
01:39:10,101 --> 01:39:12,501
- Hi, Mr. Lincoln.
- l was wondering if you could

1086
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,164
get someone who can explain
why my insurance policy

1087
01:39:15,273 --> 01:39:17,434
is sitting downstairs
on my fucking sofa.

1088
01:39:18,009 --> 01:39:20,637
- Can you hold, please?
- Sure.

1089
01:39:31,823 --> 01:39:35,987
l'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
l was getting myself organized.

1090
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:38,359
OK, shall we go?
Are you ready?

1091
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,006
- Something's wrong.
- What?

1092
01:39:51,242 --> 01:39:55,144
His eyes are lying.
The same as yours do.

1093
01:39:55,213 --> 01:39:56,544
You stay here.

1094
01:39:56,614 --> 01:39:58,639
- No, don't...
- Shall we?

1095
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:01,675
- Yeah.
- ls everything OK?

1096
01:40:01,753 --> 01:40:04,847
Yeah. She's gonna stay here
in case they don't believe us.

1097
01:40:04,923 --> 01:40:07,153
No, come on, we'll all go.
lt'll be good.

1098
01:40:07,225 --> 01:40:08,351
No, she's gonna stay.

1099
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:17,327
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1100
01:40:18,937 --> 01:40:20,268
That's...

1101
01:40:29,814 --> 01:40:32,647
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

1102
01:40:32,717 --> 01:40:35,550
- l'll drive.
- Oh, no. l'll drive.

1103
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,713
No, really.

1104
01:40:37,789 --> 01:40:39,814
Do you know how?

1105
01:40:39,891 --> 01:40:43,554
- Yeah, l taught myself.
- But you don't know the way.

1106
01:40:43,628 --> 01:40:46,028
Well, then you can show me.

1107
01:40:48,867 --> 01:40:52,428
Well, be careful.
This is a V-12-09 Caddy.

1108
01:40:52,537 --> 01:40:56,940
Seven hundred and fifty horsepower,
$500,000 car.

1109
01:40:59,811 --> 01:41:01,438
Put your thumb on that.

1110
01:41:03,982 --> 01:41:06,712
You were worth every penny.
We've the same prints.

1111
01:41:06,785 --> 01:41:08,980
- What are you doing?
- Getting directions.

1112
01:41:09,054 --> 01:41:11,818
Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Where would you like to go?

1113
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:13,790
KNBC news studio.

1114
01:41:13,858 --> 01:41:17,794
- One moment, please.
- Thanks for doing this.

1115
01:41:17,862 --> 01:41:22,060
That's all right. l'd like to think
you'd do the same thing if you were me.

1116
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:29,028
- How much did l cost?
- Five million dollars.

1117
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,437
ls that a lot?

1118
01:41:30,508 --> 01:41:33,443
lt's a small price to pay
to cheat death.

1119
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,392
That's a red.
lt's a red. Red. Red!

1120
01:41:51,463 --> 01:41:53,294
- Stop the car!
- Why? What? Why?

1121
01:41:53,364 --> 01:41:55,832
lt's a red light! Stop the car!

1122
01:41:58,603 --> 01:41:59,729
What's the matter?

1123
01:41:59,838 --> 01:42:03,274
You wanker! lt's a red light! Stop!
lt means stop!

1124
01:42:03,374 --> 01:42:05,774
- l didn't know that.
- You said you could drive.

1125
01:42:05,844 --> 01:42:09,541
Well, l do know how to drive.
l just don't know what the lights mean.

1126
01:42:16,221 --> 01:42:18,348
l'm sorry. l'm not ready to die.

1127
01:42:21,926 --> 01:42:23,723
Me neither!

1128
01:42:28,299 --> 01:42:29,425
Go, go, go, go!

1129
01:42:31,636 --> 01:42:33,228
- What are you doing? Stop!
- No.

1130
01:42:33,304 --> 01:42:35,534
- Stop the car now!
- No!

1131
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:45,746
- l'll shoot! Stop!
- No!

1132
01:42:45,817 --> 01:42:48,012
- Yes!
- No!

1133
01:42:58,229 --> 01:43:00,663
There's cars coming at us
in all directions!

1134
01:43:20,985 --> 01:43:22,384
They're shooting my car!

1135
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:26,647
They've shot the engine!
They've shot my engine!

1136
01:43:27,358 --> 01:43:29,417
Oh, God, my nose!

1137
01:43:52,884 --> 01:43:55,648
Come here! Where'd you think
you were going, eh?

1138
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:02,857
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

1139
01:44:02,927 --> 01:44:04,258
Get up!

1140
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:07,555
- Get off me!
- Come on, get up!

1141
01:44:07,632 --> 01:44:09,896
- Let me go!
- Get up!

1142
01:44:09,968 --> 01:44:13,460
No, no, no,don't shoot him.
l need him. l need him.

1143
01:44:19,677 --> 01:44:22,612
No, don't shoot!
He's my clone!

1144
01:44:27,218 --> 01:44:29,652
- l'm Tom Lincoln!
- What?

1145
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:32,588
No, l'm Tom Lincoln! He's lying.

1146
01:44:32,657 --> 01:44:36,252
Shut up! l own you!

1147
01:44:36,894 --> 01:44:39,624
He's the... l'm Tom Lincoln!

1148
01:44:39,697 --> 01:44:42,359
Don't point the gun at me,
you frickin' idiot!

1149
01:44:42,433 --> 01:44:45,960
- He's the clone. Look at him!
- l'm not a clone! l'm Tom!

1150
01:44:46,037 --> 01:44:49,302
No, l'm Tom! He's lying!
Point it at him!

1151
01:44:49,407 --> 01:44:51,136
- No. l'm not.
- Shut up!

1152
01:44:51,242 --> 01:44:54,302
Shut up, you're a clone! Shut up!

1153
01:44:54,412 --> 01:44:56,403
l'm Tom Lincoln!

1154
01:44:56,481 --> 01:44:58,472
- l'm Tom Lincoln!
- Don't, don't...

1155
01:45:04,756 --> 01:45:06,018
Oh, shit.

1156
01:45:33,518 --> 01:45:35,452
Close.

1157
01:45:42,627 --> 01:45:46,757
Do you think it's strange that my
insurance policy just tried to kill me?

1158
01:45:46,831 --> 01:45:49,994
l found this whole operation strange.

1159
01:45:50,068 --> 01:45:52,036
Where's the woman?

1160
01:45:52,103 --> 01:45:55,436
She said she was going out of state...

1161
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:57,007
...to look for her sponsor.

1162
01:45:57,975 --> 01:46:02,139
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

1163
01:46:02,213 --> 01:46:07,207
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

1164
01:46:07,285 --> 01:46:09,685
That kind of secret?

1165
01:46:10,321 --> 01:46:13,154
Have you talked
with anyone else about this?

1166
01:46:13,224 --> 01:46:15,055
Who would believe it?

1167
01:46:15,126 --> 01:46:17,151
Can l count on that?

1168
01:46:17,228 --> 01:46:19,492
The only thing you can count on

1169
01:46:19,564 --> 01:46:23,295
is that people will
do anything to survive.

1170
01:46:23,368 --> 01:46:28,806
l just want to live.
l don't care how.

1171
01:46:32,643 --> 01:46:34,907
Thank you.

1172
01:46:34,979 --> 01:46:38,278
Thank you very much.
Job well done.

1173
01:46:44,722 --> 01:46:47,850
Jordan? Jordan?

1174
01:46:47,925 --> 01:46:50,257
Stop.

1175
01:46:52,196 --> 01:46:55,654
Hey, Jordan, it's me. lt's me.

1176
01:47:14,051 --> 01:47:16,110
lt's you.

1177
01:47:42,413 --> 01:47:46,543
- Wow, that tongue thing is amazing.
- l know. Open your mouth again.

1178
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:51,588
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

1179
01:48:15,012 --> 01:48:17,708
The lsland is real.

1180
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:20,346
lt's us.

1181
01:48:23,421 --> 01:48:26,322
- How many are affected?
- About half.

1182
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:29,484
We're seeing the same
neural patterns in all of the Echos,

1183
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:33,519
plus every subsequent generation:
the Foxtrots, Gammas and Helos.

1184
01:48:33,598 --> 01:48:37,261
We predicated
our entire system on predictability.

1185
01:48:37,335 --> 01:48:41,738
Six Echo has displayed
the one trait that undermines it:

1186
01:48:41,839 --> 01:48:44,307
Human curiosity.

1187
01:48:45,543 --> 01:48:50,810
So... we're now
facing four generations

1188
01:48:50,882 --> 01:48:54,147
with the potential
for defiant behavior.

1189
01:48:55,319 --> 01:48:57,480
What are you suggesting?

1190
01:48:57,555 --> 01:48:59,682
A recall.

1191
01:49:00,191 --> 01:49:04,685
Wait, you mean dispose of over
200 million dollars' worth of product?

1192
01:49:04,762 --> 01:49:07,390
- Yes.
- Great.

1193
01:49:07,465 --> 01:49:11,367
Cisco lP Communicator.
Connecting to Merrick Biotech.

1194
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:17,467
This is Charlie Whitman, the public
relations director at Merrick Biotech.

1195
01:49:17,575 --> 01:49:20,840
My deepest apologies for yesterday's

1196
01:49:20,912 --> 01:49:24,348
unfortunate inconvenience you had.

1197
01:49:24,415 --> 01:49:28,818
Your defect in your policy wasn't,
by no means, an isolated incident,

1198
01:49:28,886 --> 01:49:31,821
and it is totally correctable,
l assure you.

1199
01:49:31,889 --> 01:49:35,416
We are calling other
valued clients right now

1200
01:49:35,493 --> 01:49:38,929
to inform them of a recall,
so, please, call us when you get in...

1201
01:49:40,131 --> 01:49:42,429
Unfortunate inconvenience?

1202
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,661
That's a bit of an understatement.

1203
01:49:44,735 --> 01:49:47,795
Mr. Lincoln, you're home.
Aren't you traumatized, sir?

1204
01:49:47,905 --> 01:49:51,341
l mean, l had a home invasion once
where they put the gun to my head.

1205
01:49:51,442 --> 01:49:53,933
l never forgot that.
l shook for two days.

1206
01:49:54,045 --> 01:49:56,445
What kind of recall
are you talking about?

1207
01:49:56,514 --> 01:50:00,678
Oh, it's a small defect that we found
in four of our product lines.

1208
01:50:00,751 --> 01:50:03,652
What are you gonna do
with the defective products?

1209
01:50:05,723 --> 01:50:07,020
Starting over.

1210
01:50:08,993 --> 01:50:12,019
- Starting over?
- Absolutely nothing to worry about.

1211
01:50:12,096 --> 01:50:14,326
We guarantee
our product 100 percent.

1212
01:50:14,398 --> 01:50:17,697
The unfortunate inconvenience for you

1213
01:50:17,768 --> 01:50:22,262
is we're gonna have to re-scan you
so that we can re-grow your policy.

1214
01:50:22,373 --> 01:50:26,776
Does today work for you at all?
Pick you up by helicopter at 3:00?

1215
01:50:26,844 --> 01:50:29,108
l'll call you back.

1216
01:50:36,787 --> 01:50:38,414
Dr. Merrick,

1217
01:50:38,489 --> 01:50:41,788
how do we remove the
defective products from the population

1218
01:50:41,859 --> 01:50:44,589
without disrupting the others?

1219
01:50:44,662 --> 01:50:47,028
We already have the mechanism in place.

1220
01:50:48,232 --> 01:50:51,429
Dahlgren Two Foxtrot.

1221

1223

He kept a journal
and a lot of maps.

1224
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:07,076
After l figure out how
to get that thing in the water,

1225
01:51:07,151 --> 01:51:09,676
then we can get on it and...

1226
01:51:09,754 --> 01:51:11,585
...we'll keep heading south.

1227
01:51:11,656 --> 01:51:13,886
We could live like real people.

1228
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:16,756
Tulie Two Foxtrot.

1229

Ginsberg Two Helo.

1230
01:51:22,767 --> 01:51:24,564
We'll disappear.

1231
01:51:25,136 --> 01:51:26,501
Yeah.

1232
01:51:27,772 --> 01:51:30,172
But after.

1233
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:41,775
All those people we left behind.

1234
01:51:41,852 --> 01:51:44,685
Jones Three Echo.

1235
01:52:01,772 --> 01:52:04,400
When we were escaping,

1236
01:52:04,508 --> 01:52:05,975
l saw this room.

1237
01:52:06,844 --> 01:52:09,677
lf l could get in
and shut it down,

1238
01:52:09,747 --> 01:52:12,045
they'd see the truth.

1239
01:52:20,458 --> 01:52:25,088
Gentlemen, there is, however, another
matter that requires board approval.

1240
01:52:28,532 --> 01:52:31,865
The disposal of 200 million dollars
of infected product.

1241
01:52:38,876 --> 01:52:40,503
All in favor?

1242
01:52:40,611 --> 01:52:41,578
- Aye.
- Aye.

1243
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:43,169
Aye.

1244
01:52:57,027 --> 01:52:58,426
You've been chosen.

1245
01:52:59,363 --> 01:53:00,762
You're special.

1246
01:53:03,334 --> 01:53:05,131
Very special.

1247
01:53:11,008 --> 01:53:13,374
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1248
01:53:13,444 --> 01:53:14,536
Thanks.

1249
01:53:19,617 --> 01:53:20,606
Here you go.

1250
01:53:20,684 --> 01:53:24,381
- And what do you say to the nice lady?
- Thank you!

- Escort her to Surgery Prep Seven.
- l better say hello.

1253
01:55:01,085 --> 01:55:03,053
Mr. Lincoln, thank you for coming.

1254
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:05,850
lt's great seeing you again,
and we are so, so sorry

1255
01:55:05,923 --> 01:55:07,982
about this entire episode.

1256
01:55:08,058 --> 01:55:10,652
l want to tell you that
we are going to be birthing

1257
01:55:10,728 --> 01:55:12,958
a brand new agnate for you
free of charge.

1258
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:16,329
Won't cost you a penny. After you.

1259
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,233
Would you like an apple?
An afternoon snack...?

1260
01:55:19,303 --> 01:55:22,397
- No. How long will this take?
- lt's gonna take about an hour.

1261
01:55:22,506 --> 01:55:25,100
l read that you're from Scotland.
l prefer lreland.

1262
01:55:25,209 --> 01:55:26,801
But what part in Scotland...?

1263
01:55:26,911 --> 01:55:29,880
l realize that this small talk
is just part of yourjob,

1264
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:33,279
- but let's cut the shite, OK?
- Point taken. My apologies.

1265
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:35,750
l'm just a bit of a jabberjaw.
Chatty Cathy.

1266
01:55:35,819 --> 01:55:38,151
Turn right. This way.

1267
01:55:44,995 --> 01:55:46,895
l'll take her.

1268
01:55:58,575 --> 01:56:01,203
This is gonna be the exact
same routine as last time.

1269
01:56:01,312 --> 01:56:03,974
Mind the hose.
Technician will be here.

1270
01:56:04,048 --> 01:56:08,451
Look at you, so young and successful.
l always wanted to get into yachting.

1271
01:56:20,097 --> 01:56:22,258
l hear they're taking your kidneys,

1272
01:56:23,067 --> 01:56:27,197
your lungs, your heart.

1273
01:56:27,271 --> 01:56:30,434
They are gonna hack you up.

1274
01:56:36,113 --> 01:56:37,842
Too bad.

1275
01:56:52,663 --> 01:56:54,528
No one is touching me.

1276
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,830
- Give me your Tri-Key.
- You shot me.

1277
01:56:58,902 --> 01:57:01,735
Shut up! Give me your walkie!

1278
01:57:04,942 --> 01:57:06,910
Get down. Get down, now!

1279
01:57:50,587 --> 01:57:53,055
- You all right?
- Yes.

1280
01:57:54,324 --> 01:57:55,951
Come on.

1281
01:57:57,494 --> 01:57:59,189
l've got this figured out.

1282
01:57:59,263 --> 01:58:00,753
l kind of...

1283
01:58:00,831 --> 01:58:04,892
l messed it up in one area right down
in there, but the hole doesn't matter.

1284
01:58:04,968 --> 01:58:08,165
Something's happening.
Something's happening.

1285
01:58:08,739 --> 01:58:10,206
Hello, sir. Hello.

1286
01:58:10,307 --> 01:58:12,070
Thank you for your patience.

1287
01:58:12,176 --> 01:58:14,576
l'm sure you're excited
to get to the lsland.

1288
01:58:14,645 --> 01:58:17,978
lf you grab your belongings
and line up in a single-file line

1289
01:58:18,048 --> 01:58:20,175
and follow me,
we'll be on our way.

1290
01:58:21,618 --> 01:58:26,214
Take this. Go.
You have to keep going.

1291
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:28,258
- Go. Go.
- OK.

1292
01:58:28,325 --> 01:58:30,225
Go shut it down.

1293
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:45,872
l love that Picasso.

1294
01:58:46,743 --> 01:58:49,507
Do you like Picasso, Mr. Laurent?

1295
01:58:50,614 --> 01:58:54,983
You delivered on your promise.
Well done. l'm very pleased. Thank you.

1296
01:58:55,052 --> 01:58:57,384
What about the client?
Sarah Jordan?

1297
01:58:57,454 --> 01:58:58,546
She's doubtful.

1298
01:58:58,622 --> 01:59:00,556
Even if the transplant's a success,

1299
01:59:00,624 --> 01:59:04,060
her brain damage may be too severe
for any real recovery.

1300
01:59:04,128 --> 01:59:06,392
You took too long bringing her back.

1301
01:59:06,463 --> 01:59:09,296
The girl, you're going to harvest her,
kill her anyway,

1302
01:59:09,366 --> 01:59:11,493
even though it won't
make any difference?

1303
01:59:12,269 --> 01:59:16,262
That's the privilege our clients
pay for, Mr. Laurent.

1304
01:59:16,373 --> 01:59:20,867
Now, do excuse me,
l have business to attend to.

1305
01:59:21,879 --> 01:59:25,781
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabe Rebellion?

1306
01:59:25,849 --> 01:59:29,945
And when he was killed,
me and my brothers were branded,

1307
01:59:32,222 --> 01:59:36,090
so others would know
we were less than human.

1308
01:59:36,793 --> 01:59:40,991
l've seen and done things l'm not proud
of, but at some point you realize war...

1309
01:59:42,299 --> 01:59:44,062
...is a business.

1310
01:59:49,139 --> 01:59:51,607
So when did killing
become a business for you?

1311
01:59:57,681 --> 02:00:00,980
Oh, it's so much more than that.

1312
02:00:03,453 --> 02:00:07,219
l have discovered the Holy Grail
of science, Mr. Laurent.

1313
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:08,918
l give life.

1314
02:00:09,326 --> 02:00:12,921
The agnates,
they're simply tools, instruments.

1315
02:00:12,996 --> 02:00:15,863
They have no souls.

1316
02:00:16,266 --> 02:00:18,996
The possibilities are endless here.

1317
02:00:19,069 --> 02:00:23,028
ln two years' time, l will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

1318
02:00:23,106 --> 02:00:26,507
How many people on Earth
can say that, Mr. Laurent?

1319
02:00:28,278 --> 02:00:30,178
l guess just you and God.

1320
02:00:33,951 --> 02:00:36,943
That's the answer
you're looking for, isn't it?

1321
02:00:42,025 --> 02:00:44,653
Mr. Whitman has your check downstairs.

1322
02:00:52,035 --> 02:00:54,697
Looks like single gunshot.

1323
02:00:57,207 --> 02:00:58,970
Oh, no.

1324
02:00:59,843 --> 02:01:01,242
Wrong wrist.

1325
02:01:01,311 --> 02:01:05,680
Dr. Merrick,
the body thatjust came in...

1326
02:01:05,749 --> 02:01:08,479
...is the client.

1327
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:22,958
lssue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

1328
02:01:27,771 --> 02:01:30,740
Down, down, down!
Move, move!

1329
02:01:44,021 --> 02:01:46,922
- Disturbance in the Hologram Room.
- l'm on it.

1330
02:01:48,992 --> 02:01:52,223
Dr. Merrick, l sent censors
to check a possible attempted breach

1331
02:01:52,296 --> 02:01:54,230
in Hologram Control.

1332
02:02:35,205 --> 02:02:37,605
One after another,
step into the room.

1333
02:02:37,674 --> 02:02:40,199
lf l'm going to the lsland,
why did l leave my bag?

1334
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:41,971
Step right in, thank you.

1335
02:02:42,913 --> 02:02:46,872
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
ls this the right way? l...

1336
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:49,680
Are you new here?
l don't know if this is the way!

1337
02:02:49,753 --> 02:02:52,221
lt's going to the lsland!

1338
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:56,654
l'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

1339
02:03:01,231 --> 02:03:02,926
Open the door!

1340
02:03:08,472 --> 02:03:11,464
She said open the door!

1341
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:51,545
You could have taken over his life,
but you chose to come back.

1342
02:03:51,615 --> 02:03:54,345
You truly are unique, Six Echo.

1343
02:03:55,085 --> 02:03:57,280
My name is Lincoln!

1344
02:05:15,999 --> 02:05:18,024
l brought you into this world...

1345
02:05:24,441 --> 02:05:26,272
...and l can take you out of it.
