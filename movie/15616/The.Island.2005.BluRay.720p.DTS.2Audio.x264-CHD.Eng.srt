1
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,107
You're special.

2
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:03,014
You have a very special
purpose in life.

3
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,791
You've been chosen.

4
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:20,705
The lsland awaits you.

5
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,690
l'm fine, l'm fine, l'm fine.

6
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,721
Good morning, Tower One.

7
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,384
Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.

8
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,949
Sunny and mild.

9
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,063
Hey, l'm missing a left shoe.

10
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,512
And when you get a chance,
l'd like another color.

11
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,859
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:33,066
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- l'm missing a shoe.

13
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:46,280
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,111
Thank you.

15
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,086
We're full.

16
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,923
Good morning.
July 19th, 2019.

17
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,261
Another day in paradise.

18
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,377
Starkweather Two Delta,

19
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,814
your time has come.

20
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,853
You're moving out to the lsland.

21
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,888
Starkweather Two Delta here.

22
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,357
And, as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.

23
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:30,156
l've only been with you guys
for, like, six months,

24
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,992
but l won the lottery.

25
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,692
- That's right, me, Starkweather, OK?
- Six months.

26
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:39,260
To go out and breathe fresh air,
swim in the ocean...

27
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:43,501
l can't believe l won.
You call me Mr. Popular, l know.

28
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,271
lt's me. lt's me.

29
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:50,975
You guys know l'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.

30
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,513
l'm going to the lsland!
We're gonna have so much fun!

31
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:58,522
But l need to see you guys out there.
You can do it! l won!

32
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,887
That was this week's...

33
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,518
We got a disturbance
on elevator 12, plaza level.

34
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:06,325
...just moments before his
final departure to the lsland,

35
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,458
nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.

36
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,764
- Lucky guy, huh?
- You can be a winner too.

37
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,930
The next lottery is tonight.

38
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,938
The next lottery is tonight.

39
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:25,081
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

40
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,718
- What about you?
- Three.

41
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,778
Three. l've been here seven.

42
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:35,122
lf l do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

43
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,392
l'm such a loser.

44
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,493
Sir.

45
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:13,554
Yeah, you.

46
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,125
Swipe.

47
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:22,164
Gandu Three Echo, you've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

48
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:25,243
Yes, l had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

49
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,904
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

50
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:32,011
- l'm feeling much better.
- Well, then, have a pleasant day.

51
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,951
Thank you, you too.
You both have a pleasant day too.

52
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,376
Feel the stretch.

53
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,343
One more breath in.

54
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,660
But l was in that section.

55
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,324
No, l don't understand!

56
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,029
- l tried! l tried to do the best l...
- Listen to me!

57
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:31,008
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

58
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:34,909
A healthy person is a happy person.

59
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:45,555
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

60
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:47,114
No bacon today?

61
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,387
You got a nutrition flag,
means no bacon.

62
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,986
ln that case, two eggs,
over easy, not too runny,

63
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:53,496
and a side of sausages.

64
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,398
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

65
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,900
You ain't cute and l got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

66
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,906
Now, what's it gonna be?

67
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,032
Move it.

68
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,209
Surprise me.

69
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,977
Surprise.

70
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:19,250
Yummy. Next.

71
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,833
Watch and learn.

72
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,434
Next.

73
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,975
Jordan Two Delta.

74
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,602
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

75
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:44,204
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

76
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,149
- Eggs, please.
- OK.

77
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,618
So, where were you the other day?
We missed you.

78
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,384
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

79
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,688
Get you anything else?

80
00:09:58,697 --> 00:09:59,959
Maybe a little bacon.

81
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,624
No, it says l shouldn't.

82
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:06,432
- Go ahead.
- Four, five pieces, please.

83
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:09,470
Thank you.

84
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,234
Well, good luck.
Gotta run along now.

85
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:16,576
You're not going.
You gotta stay for dinner.

86
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:19,310
- l softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

87
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:22,080
- Back on your diet?
- You kidding? l love this stuff.

88
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,917
Better eat up.
You'll need all your strength tonight.

89
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,184
ls that a challenge?

90
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,886
l promise l'll go easy on you.

91
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,696
Please separate.
Find your seats now.

92
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,700
Yeah.

93
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:42,404
'''Who wants Sally?' said Dick.
'l do,' said Jane.

94
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:45,272
'l cannot find Sally.

95
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:50,042
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.

96
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,709
ls Sally here?'''

97
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,693
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

98
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,970
What'd you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

99
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,640
Sir?

100
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:25,513
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please.

101
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,126
Please, sit down.

102
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,590
So, how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

103
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:42,224
Not so good, l guess.

104
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,291
Why do you say that?

105
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,167
Well, if l'm here,
it means l'm not so good.

106
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:50,264
That's a rather negative association.

107
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,778
My only job is to see that you're happy,
things are OK with you.

108
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,438
Right.

109
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,711
Your file shows that you've
been interacting regularly

110
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,084
with Jordan Two Delta.

111
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:08,091
- There's no law against friendship.
- No. No, we encourage it,

112
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,562
but, obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

113
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,599
l know the rules of proximity.

114
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,597
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

115
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,696
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

116
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:26,334
But screening has picked up
some trace levels,

117
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:30,540
changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

118
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,413
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

119
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,079
Why don't you tell me
about your dream?

120
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:41,191
Well, it's the same dream every time.
l'm on a boat, headed to the lsland.

121
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,524
A boat? What kind of boat?

122
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,395
A nice boat.

123
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,023
Draw it for me, would you?

124
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,975
So, you are heading
toward the lsland.

125
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,034
What happens then?

126
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,978
- l drown.
- Really?

127
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:07,008
- Why do you think that is?
- l don't know. You tell me.

128
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:10,111
- Maybe you're afraid of winning.
- Why would l be afraid?

129
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,053
You tell me.

130
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,161
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

131
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,231
Well, it's...

132
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,462
lt's just...

133
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,535
All right.
Tuesday night is tofu night.

134
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,939
And l'm asking myself, who decided
that everyone here likes tofu

135
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,604
in the first place?
And what is tofu, anyway?

136
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,876
And why can't l have bacon?
l line up every morning,

137
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:40,884
and l'm not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast.

138
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,113
And...
Let's talk about all the white.

139
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,383
Why is everyone
wearing white all the time?

140
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:49,120
lt's impossible to keep clean.
l always get the gray stripe.

141
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:51,890
l never get any color.
And l hand it in to be cleaned,

142
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:56,024
and someone cleans it, and folds it
neatly back in my drawer, but who?

143
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,968
Who is that person? l don't know.

144
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,765
l just... l wanna know answers.

145
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,602
And l wish that there was more.

146
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,674
- More?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:11,045
More than just waiting
to go to the lsland.

148
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,184
Lincoln,

149
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:19,087
it's your nature
to question things.

150
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:24,026
But don't you realize how lucky you are?
That you survived the contamination.

151
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:28,293
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

152
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,597
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

153
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:39,432
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to the lsland too?

154
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,944
No.

155
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:45,244
My responsibility is to make sure

156
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,614
this facility continues to operate.

157
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:53,317
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

158
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,053
...we can't win the lottery.

159
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,928
Let me see that.

160
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,865
You draw well.

161
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,905
''Renovatio.''
What does that mean?

162
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,236
l don't know.
lt's always in my dream.

163
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,045
l'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

164
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,280
What sort of tests?

165
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,709
Nice tests.

166
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,116
Come with me.

167
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,990
Take a seat.

168
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,093
OK, let's get you comfortable.

169
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,659
Swing back.

170
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,845
- l thought these were nice tests.
- lt's a synaptic brain scan.

171
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,107
Totally harmless.

172
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:53,150
Don't worry, it's painless.

173
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,629
- lt hurts.
- Not really.

174
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,435
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

175
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,840
Yeah, it really, really does!

176
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,180
The micro-sensors
will move along your optic nerve.

177
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,586
They'll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours,

178
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:34,352
after which,
you'll pass them through your urine.

179
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,552
Now, that might hurt.

180
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,567
Six Echo, you're late.

181
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,413
Jones, you ever get bored doing this?

182
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:07,719
- Doing what?
- This.

183
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,784
- l never really thought about it.
- l think about it a lot.

184
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,830
- About what?
- This boring job.

185
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:16,060
- What are we doing here?
- We're feeding the nutrient lines.

186
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:19,763
We eat food, food's gotta have
vitamins, right? lt's good for us.

187
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,499
You don't ever wonder about anything?

188
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,075
Where do these tubes go?

189
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,744
They start there.

190
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,747
And they go... right there.

191
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,884
Hey. Did you get a look
at the new guy?

192
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,012
Seven Foxtrot.

193
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:40,854
They found another survivor.
They keep finding them.

194
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:42,586
He'll probably win the lottery.

195
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,925
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go, you try it.

196
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:49,296
Straight down in the hole.

197
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:53,201
ln the hole.
No, no, no. Put it down.

198
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:56,705
Did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination?

199
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:01,302
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-The-Questions,
let me ask you this:

200
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,308
Lottery's supposed
to be random, right?

201
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:05,474
Right.

202
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,882
What if it's not?
What if it's rigged?

203
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:09,779
Rigged?

204
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,348
l've been working on this. Here.

205
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,415
Take a look at that.

206
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:19,120
lt charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the lsland.

207
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,496
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

208
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,502
- What is this?
- l took the first letter in each name.

209
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,697
l assigned it a point value system,
based on the alphabet,

210
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,240
like the last guy,
Starkweather, S equals 15.

211
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,970
Q equals 15, S equals 19.

212
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:35,137
- Do you see what l'm saying?
- No.

213
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:38,705
Well, maybe if you would listen to me,
l'm trying to tell you.

214
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:42,184
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

215
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:45,654
You multiply... You divide it by
the amount of... You divide it...

216
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:50,217
You divide it by the amount of people,
which is 25, a thousand plus five, 2500.

217
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:54,060
You know what that spells?
J-O-N-E-S.

218
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,763
- l'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

219
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,670
- No.
- Gentlemen,

220
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:04,166
l'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

221
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,368
There you go. Straight.

222
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,741
Straight down in the hole.

223
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,678
- There you go.
- Straight...

224
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,845
- What? He had something on his... OK.
- Go.

225
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,954
Lima! Are you OK?
What's wrong?

226
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:25,655
Code 15, we need med-techs stat!
Lima One Alpha.

227
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,459
Let's give her some air, OK?

228
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:30,160
You're gonna be OK, all right?
Relax and breathe.

229
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,862
Can l get a wheelchair?
lt's for Lima One Alpha.

230
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,428
- You OK?
- l think it's time.

231
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,967
Lima, you're going to the lsland.

232
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,049
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

233
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:47,016
l hope l see you soon.

234
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:54,556
Everyone, please follow her out.
Quickly and carefully. Watch the glass.

235
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,752
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

236
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,566
That's fair. That's real fair.

237
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:07,092
Ladies, ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen. Thank you.

238
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:13,240
Everyone, back to work.

239
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,279
That is so not fair.

240
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:20,177
Oh, man, l hate this jealousy thing.
lt's giving me heart palpitations.

241
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,310
Tech Services.

242
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:24,183
Computer's down again.

243
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,114
l'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

244
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:30,592
l have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-Key. Contamination kit.

245
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,754
- Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

246
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,351
- Hey! What are you doing?
- l'm gonna see this guy.

247
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:09,397
Hey, chief. We got live wires
all over the place here.

248
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,698
Hey, l've been looking all over for you.

249
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:14,963
- What?
- l've been looking...

250
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,973
- Can't hear you.
- l've been looking all over for you.

251
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,445
lf you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

252
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,775
How you doing, Mac?

253
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,076
- What are you doing here?
- My chip fried again.

254
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:30,086
Yeah. How much longer
do you think that one's gonna work?

255
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,484
- What are you two clowns looking at?
- Hey,

256
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,619
you got any of that stuff
on you today?

257
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:41,059
Oh, look, it's break time.
Come on.

258
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,636
You're a bad influence on me.

259
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:48,638
Must be why l like you so much.

260
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,702
What's it like where you live?
ln Sector Five?

261
00:21:56,781 --> 00:22:00,410
lt's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, l guess.

262
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:06,746
l like coming out here, talking.

263
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,486
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

264
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,686
Yeah.

265
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,321
Step into my office.

266
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:23,707
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

267
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:25,708
Where are their clothes?

268
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,073
What's with Dr. Merrick?

269
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:31,808
You mean why does he act like he's
got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

270
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:32,974
Yeah.

271
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,348
lt's called a God complex.

272
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,479
All doctors are like that.
They think they know everything.

273
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:40,683
What's God?

274
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,318
Well, you know when you
want something really bad

275
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,589
and you close your eyes
and you wish for it?

276
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:49,895
- God's the guy that ignores you.
- Oh. Right.

277
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:52,629
Tech Service requested
in Product Extraction.

278
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,898
Yeah, l'll be right there.

279
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,243
Oh, hey. Let me get that.

280
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:04,213
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

281
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:07,080
lt's an old stash.
You know, from before.

282
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,244
You mean from
before the contamination?

283
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,551
Yeah. Come on, you're killing me
with questions here.

284
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:14,454
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

285
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,892
Because you're,
you know, like, special.

286
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:19,759
Why? Why am l special?

287
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,457
There's another question.

288
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,431
You remember what we talked about?

289
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:27,062
You don't tell anybody
about our conversations?

290
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:30,402
- 'Cause that can get me in big trouble.
- No, l don't.

291
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:31,975
Good.

292
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,244
How's it going?

293
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:16,914
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

294
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:19,748
OK, l'll catch you later.

295
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,819
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

296
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:27,295
Yep.

297
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,299
What a surprise.

298
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,135
Go hot.

299
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:40,410
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

300
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,445
You'd think with the money
this place rakes in

301
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:45,982
- they could afford decent equipment.
- Yeah.

302
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,647
Ready?

303
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,212
Cut the O2.

304
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,227
Seriously, unless you want to see me
blow chunks, can you wait till l'm gone?

305
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:00,388
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

306
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:25,017
Breathe.

307
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:28,615
Come on, yeah. That's it.

308
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:34,590
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

309
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:35,893
Come on.

310
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,865
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

311
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,336
There we go.
Now we're working.

312
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,237
He's healthy.

313
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:47,938
Welcome to the world.

314
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,742
So, how's Three Helo?

315
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,285
Good.

316
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:59,252
He's feisty. Light.

317
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:03,822
Vitals seem fine.

318
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:07,630
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

319
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:12,763
Looks like we have a fine product.

320
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,100
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

321
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,012
Little bug.

322
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:24,394
Maybe next time l won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

323
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,001
lt was very sad.

324
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,874
- Hey.
- Hello.

325
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:37,743
Hi.

326
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:42,118
So you just let
a little girl beat you, huh?

327
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:45,483
Stim units restricted.

328
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,581
Yeah, yeah.
l'll have the veggie stuff.

329
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:50,491
Papassian petal juice, please.

330
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,256
lt's good for the skin.

331
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,008
Jordan, are you sick?

332
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:11,938
When l was in Dr. Merrick's office,
l thought l saw your name on a file.

333
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,711
No, l'm fine.

334
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,043
OK.

335
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,587
How are you?

336
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,749
l'm fine.

337
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:22,724
Lincoln, l can tell when you're lying

338
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:26,058
'cause your mouth smiles
but your eyes don't.

339
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:29,623
l found something.

340
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,962
- What?
- A bug.

341
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:33,297
- A bug?
- A flying bug.

342
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,371
Can l see it?

343
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,598
l think it came
in the ventilation shaft.

344
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:39,403
l thought they went extinct
with the contamination.

345
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:42,036
l know. And how did it get by
the pathogen sensors?

346
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,706
- lt must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

347
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:48,047
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

348
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,985
They keep finding people,
but where do they come from?

349
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,183
lt's good that they find survivors.

350
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:58,092
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

351
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,790
l just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

352
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,131
Good things do happen.

353
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,465
l want to see that bug.

354
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:10,963
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

355
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,202
- What?
- ''Dude.''

356
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,709
''Dude''?

357
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:17,042
- What does it mean?
- He just called me dude.

358
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:19,207
- Hey, dude.
- He said ''Hey, dude''?

359
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,183
- D-O-O-D. ''Dude.''
- Hey, dude.

360
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,980
- Dude.
- Dude.

361
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,613
- Lottery's gonna start.
- Like you stand a chance.

362
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:26,678
Dude.

363
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,522
Light up all etherscreens.

364
00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:33,859
And... start the lottery.

365
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:42,900
Good evening.

366
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:47,170
Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.

367
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:50,112
lt's been a busy week.

368
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,240
We've had a record two winners so far.

369
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:56,582
Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation

370
00:30:56,653 --> 00:31:00,987
to the lsland, transported
to the world's last paradise.

371
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:04,357
- And start the spin.
- And now, let the spin begin.

372
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,831
Jordan Two Delta, step up.

373
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:17,839
Your time has come.
You're moving out to the lsland.

374
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:27,272
For everyone else, never lose hope.

375
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:31,853
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,686
l can't believe it.

377
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:44,933
l have to go in the morning.

378
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,993
You were right.

379
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:51,200
Good things do happen.

380
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:57,978
l wish l'd known you better.

381
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,877
You two.

382
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:02,384
Watch your proximity.

383
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:13,392
l'll see you on the lsland.

384
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:34,840
You want to go to the lsland.

385
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,188
Breathe!

386
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,217
You've been chosen.

387
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,424
The lsland awaits you.

388
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:11,604
Check into the nurses' station
up the corridor, take your first left.

389
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,578
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

390
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:17,882
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

391
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,981
She's so beautiful.

392
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:26,379
l've never seen a baby.

393
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:27,821
Can l hold her?

394
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:29,415
Notjust yet.

395
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,267
Are we going to the lsland?

396
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,937
Oh, my God.

397
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,917
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

398
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:02,782
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

399
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,821
lt's my baby. Oh, my gosh.

400
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:06,150
Whenever you're ready,

401
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,954
we have copies of your
policy termination for your records.

402
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:12,756
Look at her. She's beautiful.

403
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:18,898
Starkweather? That big, cute football
player on the Reebok commercials?

404
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,733
l love him! ls he in there?
l thought that was him, girl!

405
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:23,465
l just love him!

406
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:26,665
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

407
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:28,710
Any chance l can make this pickup?

408
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:31,076
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

409
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:35,448
Lady, l've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

410
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,818
We don't fly in bad weather.

411
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:45,088
They look real busy.
So l'd have a seat.

412
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:48,620
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

413
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:53,829
Heart rate 102.
BP 126 over 82.

414
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,928
- Laser cutter ready?

415
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,008
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

416
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,009
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

417
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,271
Prepare that bone saw.

418
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,875
l think we're about ready to open.

419
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:26,630
Let's clean that drip.

420
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,308
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

421
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:39,615
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

422
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:45,954
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP 138 over 92.

423
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:50,293
Heart rate's still rising.

424
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,557
- Boost the anesthetic level!
- He's fighting the ventilator.

425
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,155
l don't wanna euthanize this guy
to get his liver!

426
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:05,868
Guards!

427
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:09,277
Oh, my God!

428
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,386
Stop that man! Get him!

429
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:27,988
Stop!

430
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:46,674
All right, relax, relax, big guy.
Relax.

431
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,843
Easy, easy, easy!
Don't damage him!

432
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:53,946
- Relax!
- No!

433
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,549
l don't want to die, no! No!

434
00:39:56,626 --> 00:40:00,494

You promised!

435
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,999
l wanna live!
l don't wanna die!

436
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,659
No!

437
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:09,438
Hey.

438
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:13,767
You OK, buddy? lt's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

439
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:16,971
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

440
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,054
Check this part out.

441
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:32,151
Wait, OK, watch.
Wait, wait.

442
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:35,959
Boom! Did you see that? Man.

443
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:38,592
That is so cruel, man.

444
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,099
Oh, man. Down for the count.

445
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:46,539
Gentlemen, l understand
there's been an incident.

446
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:49,601
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

447
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,273
- And do you find that funny?
- No, sir.

448
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,443
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

449
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,713
Play it back, please.

450
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,591
Stop.

451
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,356
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

452
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,727
He was scared, l helped him up.

453
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,189
Play it back at half-speed.

454
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:19,668
Freeze.

455
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:22,242
Magnify his wrist.

456
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,015
We have a product on the loose.

457
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,687
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

458
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,281
- Let's go.
- OK, down to Level 2.

459
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:50,268
You can't come in here!

460
00:41:55,578 --> 00:41:58,570
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,023
- How sweet.
- You gotta come with me.

462
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:19,090
What?

463
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,364
Move! Move!

464
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:32,882
We got a match!
Lincoln Six Echo.

465
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,315
l want a full contamination lockdown.

466
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:36,784
Find Six Echo.

467
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:41,222
- Masks down.
- What the hell?!

468
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,488
- l need to see all your faces.
- l don't care what he says, nurse,

469
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:47,462
that's live human tissue.
Seal that liver now.

470
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,225
Check the back corners!

471
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:57,703
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

472
00:42:58,308 --> 00:42:59,900
Find out.

473
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,973
- Men aren't supposed to be...
- You gotta trust me.

474
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,037
- What?
- l saw them.

475
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,413
- Who?
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.

476
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,045
- What?
- They killed her and cut him open...

477
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,088
Stop it!
l want to go back to my room.

478
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:16,057
- They're gonna kill you.
- l'm going to the lsland.

479
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,286
Jordan, there is no lsland!
Come on!

480
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,559
l got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

481
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:25,362
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

482
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,869
Get out of the way!

483
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:29,734
Move! Move!

484
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,932
Out of the way!
Get out. Now.

485
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:33,869
Just trust me.

486
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:40,615
This is a community bulletin.

487
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:42,412
Attention, residents,

488
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:46,581
a contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.

489
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:51,093
Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.

490
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,721
Move! Move!

491
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,297
Freeze! Stop right there!

492
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:23,489
Go! Go! Go!

493
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,652
Get out of the way!

494
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:37,467
l've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

495
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,279
There they are!

496
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:57,918
l've got them in Sector Six basement!
Get them!

497
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,772
- No!
- Stop!

498
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,181
- Lincoln!
- Get up!

499
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,277
No!

500
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,782
Stop it!

501
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:29,889
No!

502
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:12,398
You've been chosen.
You have a very special purpose.

503
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:16,098
You're part of a new beginning.
You're special.

504
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,300
You have a very special purpose.

505
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:26,782
You want to go to the lsland.
Your purpose in life

506
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,819
is to populate the lsland.
You're part of a new beginning.

507
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:33,686
You're special. Very special.
You've been chosen.

508
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,749
You've been chosen.
Chosen to survive, to carry on.

509
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:40,262
You want to go to the lsland.

510
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,766
- Go, go!
- You have a very special purpose.

511
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,771
Very special.

512
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,879
- He's gotta be in here.
- l'm looking!

513
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:58,937
Check over here!

514
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:00,380
Watch your left!

515
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,012
Run!

516
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:08,287
Go! Run!

517
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,848
He's over here!

518
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:18,927
There they are! Go!

519
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,809
- Lincoln!
- Come on! Get him!

520
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,580
- Let s go. Move!
- Come on!

521
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:43,185
Come on! Come on!

522
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,887
Damn! Go, go! Go!

523
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:47,623
Come on, let's go!

524
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,296
You still think there's an lsland?

525
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:05,612
Come on!

526
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,541
Come on. Come on!

527
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:53,319
There's a door over here!

528
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:13,807
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.

529
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:19,213
Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on the lsland.

530
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,251
Jones Three Echo, l need you
to concentrate in this lab.

531
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,015
Sir, l want to focus more than anything.
l love my job. lt's interesting.

532
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,217
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated,

533
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,352
and it really worries me,
because he's a good friend of mine.

534
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:34,896
He's one of my best friends.
My only best friend.

535
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:37,091
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

536
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,361
Sir, l have one question.

537
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:41,562
Where do all the tubes go?

538
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,940
The human organism.

539
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,978
Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.

540
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,980
The product of three billion years
of evolution.

541
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:55,506
Perfect in every way, except one.

542
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,076
Like all machines, it wears out.

543
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:02,519
For centuries, the idea
of replenishing the human body

544
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,719
has been
at the forefront of science.

545
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:06,955
We need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

546
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,861
- How?
- A terrific day. By selling.

547
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,958
By selling. Sell, sell, sell.
You start, l finish.

548
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

549
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,116
welcome to
the next generation of science,

550
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:30,152
the agnate.

551
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:34,349
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood

552
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,221
to match the client's age.

553
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,817
- You're looking at stage one
- This way, sir.

554
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,294
in its development.

555
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,025
Within 12 months
it will be harvest-ready,

556
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,762
providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.

557
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:51,000
All genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

558
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:55,874
And, in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015,

559
00:51:55,945 --> 00:52:01,110
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

560
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,584
They never achieve consciousness.

561
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,884
They never think or suffer

562
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:10,983
or feel pain, joy, love, hate.

563
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,893
lt's a product, ladies and gentlemen,

564
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:16,727
in every way that matters,

565
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:19,597
not human.

566
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,934
This is our public relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

567
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,136
He'll be happy
to answer any questions.

568
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:31,713
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

569
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:35,841
l want to talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

570
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:40,513
And l want to tell you how you're
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.

571
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,893
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

572
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,695
You come highly recommended
by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

573
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,601
Though l'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

574
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,504
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

575
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,371
l was formerly with the GlGN,
French Special Forces.

576
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:02,740
l understand you had a corporate theft.

577
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,246
Yes, that's what l told
the Defense Department.

578
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:09,273
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why l require your services.

579
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,480
We've had a... security breach.

580
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:16,252
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

581
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:18,919
Because their
investment here is sizeable.

582
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:22,294
One hundred and twenty
billion dollars, to be exact.

583
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,300
And l can't afford
for them to reconsider.

584
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,632
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

585
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,639
l am in the business
of keeping my clients' confidence.

586
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,207
Good.

587
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:39,011
Two of our products have escaped.

588
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,074
lmpressive,
considering they're vegetative.

589
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:45,018
Well, after several years
of trial and error,

590
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,454
we discovered that
without consciousness,

591
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:52,961
without human experience,
emotion, without life,

592
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,327
the organs failed.

593
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:59,025
How long have they been missing?

594
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,866
Four hours and 36 minutes.

595
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,702
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

596
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:08,675
Wade, 1 .2 miles an hour,
five mile perimeter,

597
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,839
- standby for suspect description.
- We're on it.

598
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,381
Follow me.

599
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,793
- Come on, we gotta keep going.
- l have to stop. l can't run anymore.

600
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,167
- You gotta try.
- Where?

601
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:37,913
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

602
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,788
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

603
00:54:46,432 --> 00:54:48,832
What if we are contaminated?

604
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:51,495
Then we'd be dead.

605
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:54,967
There's no contamination.
lt was a lie.

606
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:09,119
- What is it?
- l don't know.

607
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:10,849
But it's alive.

608
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:18,486
Come on. lt's mean, whatever it is.

609
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:19,859
Let's rest in here.

610
00:55:19,932 --> 00:55:22,696
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor,
Sarah Jordan, is in a coma

611
00:55:22,768 --> 00:55:25,931
after a car accident.
She's in need of multiple transplants.

612
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:27,734
How long does she have?

613
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,275
Forty-eight hours.
Three days maximum.

614
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:32,072
Tell me about Six Echo.

615
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:35,545
He was really the first one
to question his environment,

616
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:37,138
his whole existence here.

617
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:41,414
Over the last few months,
he began demonstrating unstable behavior

618
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:44,320
and l can't account for it.

619
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,891
l'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

620
00:55:46,993 --> 00:55:49,393
What do they know
about the outside world?

621
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:51,396
Very little.

622
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:54,558
We control them with
the memory of a shared event.

623
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:59,002
A global contamination.
lt keeps them fearful of going outside.

624
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:03,633
The lsland is the one thing
that gives them hope,

625
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:05,734
gives them purpose.

626
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:08,542
Everything we expose them to,

627
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:12,243
their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play,

628
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:15,947
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

629
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,513
To avoid obvious complications,

630
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:21,252
they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

631
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,693
We find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether.

632
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:30,533
ln a very real sense...
they're like children.

633
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:33,299
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

634
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:53,856
- What was that?
- l don't know.

635
00:56:55,227 --> 00:56:56,956
But l want one.

636
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:13,306
Look!

637
00:57:14,146 --> 00:57:17,445
Route 39. Route 39.

638
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,507
Come on.

639
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:21,746
l got it from a friend.

640
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:48,604
l think that's it.

641
00:58:20,212 --> 00:58:21,338
What's up?

642
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:24,075
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

643
00:58:25,718 --> 00:58:27,913
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

644
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:32,587
- l am.
- And you would be who?

645
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:35,751
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

646
00:58:37,062 --> 00:58:38,893
Right.

647
00:58:38,964 --> 00:58:41,831
Y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?

648
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:44,995
- U... What? No, l don't think so.
- No.

649
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,264
McCord?

650
00:58:46,338 --> 00:58:48,772
Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.
He's in the can.

651
00:58:48,841 --> 00:58:51,241
- He's in a can?
- Taking a dump.

652
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,107
A dump? Taking it where?

653
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:58,080
Bubba, you're fixing
to get on my nerves.

654
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:01,381
- lt's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

655
00:59:01,453 --> 00:59:04,513
l have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

656
00:59:04,623 --> 00:59:07,615
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

657
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:09,717
Straight up?

658
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:23,038
Oh, that is bitchin'.

659
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,108
So this is Sector Five?

660
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:29,477
Hey! You son of a bitch!

661
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,979
You knew!

662
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:36,283
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

663
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:38,186
They're gonna be looking for you.

664
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:41,487
- Tell me what's going on!
- lf anybody sees us together,

665
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:43,687
both of us are gonna be dead.

666
00:59:43,796 --> 00:59:46,663
So, will you just
take your hands off me? Let me...

667
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:51,032
Let me pull my pants up
and l'll take you back to my place

668
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:52,900
so we can be alone. OK?

669
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:59,377
- Ed.
- Mac.

670
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:02,679
Give you... give you boys a minute?

671
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:06,674
What?
This isn't what it looks like.

672
01:00:08,854 --> 01:00:11,049
Sure. Sure.

673
01:00:11,156 --> 01:00:13,056
Get out of here, you stupid...

674
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,286
Will you stop?

675
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:20,165
You can'tjust bust in on a guy
like that. That's really rude.

676
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,860
She doesn't understand the licking.

677
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:26,336
You a knucklehead?
You brought another one?

678
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,464
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

679
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,974
Back off, Joe, OK?
Don't push me!

680
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:32,567
No, no, no, that's no good.

681
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:34,169
Put it on my tab.
We gotta go.

682
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:36,771
Friends from out of town.
Come on, sweetheart.

683
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:38,680
- Give me your number.
- Two Delta.

684
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:41,447
Hey, look. Get...
Don't test me.

685
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,488
Don't.

686
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:58,031
Well, this is nice.

687
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:03,774
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the lnstitute.

688
01:01:03,842 --> 01:01:06,242
Do y'all work with him?

689
01:01:07,379 --> 01:01:10,405
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

690
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:12,882
Those are fancy tracksuits.

691
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:16,682
Y'all exercise out in this heat,
gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.

692
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:21,285
Oh, Mac, look.
They got matching bracelets.

693
01:01:21,393 --> 01:01:25,329
- We should do that, honey.
- Suzie...

694
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:28,525
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

695
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:30,995
Yeah.

696
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,437
Actually, would you run down to Red's
and pick us up a sixer of Bud?

697
01:01:34,506 --> 01:01:37,839
- We've got to talk shop.
- OK, baby.

698
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,242
- Just making friends.
- l know. Good. Just...

699
01:01:40,312 --> 01:01:41,574
Bye.

700
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:49,352
Why do they lie, Mac?

701
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:52,083
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

702
01:01:55,627 --> 01:01:57,754
To keep you
from knowing what you are.

703
01:01:58,564 --> 01:02:02,193
- What we are?
- What are we?

704
01:02:02,267 --> 01:02:06,294
Man, why do l gotta be the guy
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

705
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:12,806
OK, look. You're...

706
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:17,477
Well, you're not like me.

707
01:02:19,284 --> 01:02:22,481
l mean, you're not... human.

708
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:28,086
l mean, you're human,
but you just, you're not real.

709
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:32,061
You're not,
like, a real person. Like me.

710
01:02:35,234 --> 01:02:37,566
You're clones.

711
01:02:39,605 --> 01:02:43,439
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

712
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,136
- What?
- Clones?

713
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,405
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

714
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:50,846
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a facelift

715
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:53,077
or one of 'em gets sick
and need a new part,

716
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:55,484
they take it from you.

717
01:02:57,156 --> 01:03:00,387
But l have a mother.
l remember her.

718
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:02,551
- Yeah, l know.
- l grew up on a farm.

719
01:03:02,661 --> 01:03:04,686
l have a little dog and l had a bike.

720
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:06,321
And a bike. Right.

721
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:09,833
lt was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars

722
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:12,097
and you rode it
to your grandmother's.

723
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:15,436
You ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies.

724
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:16,838
Yeah.

725
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:21,107
No. Memory imprints.
l seen them.

726
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,377
A buddy of mine is a programmer
at the lnstitute. He showed me.

727
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:28,045
There's only 12 stories.
They change around little details,

728
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,350
but they're all pretty much the same.

729
01:03:30,422 --> 01:03:35,860
The life you think you had
before the ''contamination,''

730
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:38,362
it never happened.

731
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:43,260
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

732
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:47,499
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood, be my guest.

733
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,131
How long?

734
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,870
How long have we been alive?

735
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:55,980
You're Echo generation,
so you're three.

736
01:03:57,649 --> 01:03:59,173
Delta means you're four.

737
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:02,915
Three?

738
01:04:02,988 --> 01:04:06,947
The whole reason you exist is
'cause everyone wants to live forever.

739
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:08,890
lt's the new American dream.

740
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:12,453
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

741
01:04:12,564 --> 01:04:16,056
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

742
01:04:16,134 --> 01:04:20,400
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.

743
01:04:20,472 --> 01:04:25,000
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

744
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:28,808
He doesn't want anybody knowing
the truth, especially not sponsors.

745
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:32,749
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

746
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:34,979
They, like, own you.

747
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:42,960
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

748
01:04:43,028 --> 01:04:47,761
Just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

749
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:52,364
Besides, do you know
how many laws Merrick's breaking

750
01:04:52,437 --> 01:04:54,667
to have you two hatched?

751
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,739
Your sponsors
can't have any part of that.

752
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,210
They're like high society,
rich and famous.

753
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,805
lf they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

754
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:06,510
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the truth.

755
01:05:06,585 --> 01:05:07,950
- What?
- Yeah.

756
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,113
No, that's the worst idea l ever heard.

757
01:05:10,188 --> 01:05:12,679
You know how dead l'd be?
Not to mention fired?

758
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,123
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

759
01:05:15,193 --> 01:05:18,162
Stop, stop! Fold, stop.
Brakes. No. Come on.

760
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,960
You're the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

761
01:05:21,033 --> 01:05:24,332
They're not gonna care.
What? They're gonna care?

762
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:25,734
You know what l would do?

763
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:29,171
l would just get as far away
from here as l could.

764
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:30,469
Go to the beach.

765
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:33,705
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

766
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:35,713
We're asking for your help.

767
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:39,113
Oh, God.

768
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:51,919
lnfrared's having a hard time picking up
a heat signature. Sand's too hot.

769
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:58,762
He was implanted
with micro-sensors yesterday.

770
01:05:58,837 --> 01:06:02,705
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

771
01:06:02,774 --> 01:06:06,073
- lf we can get within half a mile.
- Do it.

772
01:06:06,144 --> 01:06:08,942
Your sponsors names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

773
01:06:09,014 --> 01:06:10,675
Her sponsor lives in New York.

774
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:13,775
The number in your name
is a regional code.

775
01:06:13,852 --> 01:06:18,152
Six Echo, that means
your sponsor lives in LA.

776
01:06:18,256 --> 01:06:20,383
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state?

777
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:21,982
Put this on.

778
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:25,086
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

779
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:27,927
Keep going. What size?

780
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:30,300
All right.

781
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:32,530
These are bags, OK?
You put stuff in 'em.

782
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:35,368
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

783
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,930
We're not idiots.

784
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:40,467
Excuse me, Miss ''l'm so smart
l can't wait to go to the lsland.''

785
01:06:44,082 --> 01:06:46,107
Yeah. Good.

786
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:52,685
Wait. Hold, hold, hold.

787
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:55,259
People don't really
wear these on the outside.

788
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,920
These are mail-order, OK?
These stay here.

789
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:04,768
No. Mail-order, OK?
Clones don't wear these.

790
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,837
All right, listen up.

791
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:12,968
This card is like stim credits, OK?

792
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:16,014
lt'll get you food, but l gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours

793
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:20,177
or else they'll know l helped you.
After that, use the cash.

794
01:07:23,255 --> 01:07:24,347
All right, look.

795
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:27,448
l know you're new to this
whole human experience and all,

796
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:29,254
but there's one universal truth

797
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:32,125
and that is you never
give a woman your credit card.

798
01:07:32,898 --> 01:07:34,889
Right.

799
01:07:40,872 --> 01:07:42,567
l got something. lt's hot.

800
01:07:53,218 --> 01:07:55,778
Oh, God.

801
01:07:57,589 --> 01:08:00,649
- Train four...
- Train'll be here. Hustle.

802
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:04,287
...to Sacramento
is now boarding at platform A.

803
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:08,162
All right, stay. All right?
Just stay. Don't move.

804
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:10,768
Mama!

805
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:16,541
Look at that!

806
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:18,872
Those are kids.

807
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,203
Wow.

808
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:31,377
Come here. The train is non-stop to LA.
You need these to get on.

809
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:35,119
When you get there, look up your
sponsors in the information directory.

810
01:08:35,193 --> 01:08:36,660
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

811
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:40,528
- What is an information directory?
- lt'll tell you where they live.

812
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:43,601
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

813
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:47,764
One thing l can tell you about people,
is that they'll do anything to survive.

814
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,807
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

815
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,609
Thanks a lot.

816
01:08:52,677 --> 01:08:56,238
All right. l'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

817
01:08:56,314 --> 01:08:58,680
Better not get me in trouble.

818
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:12,853
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, that's a good one.

819
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,704
l think l got an lD.
Two in the center.

820
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,608
Run!

821
01:11:06,515 --> 01:11:08,107
Run!

822
01:11:10,953 --> 01:11:12,113
God!

823
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:19,853
Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform C.

824
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,069
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

825
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:45,386
- This was supposed to be a simple job?
- lt's never simple.

826
01:11:45,454 --> 01:11:47,115
We got a missing credit card.

827
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:51,626
McCord just used it to buy train tickets
and it's not in his wallet.

828
01:11:51,693 --> 01:11:55,925
Monitor the account. Have Amtrak
patch you through to the conductor.

829
01:11:57,065 --> 01:11:58,930
Get me a new team in LA.

830
01:12:01,737 --> 01:12:04,672
- Got here as fast as l could.
- Come here.

831
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:07,937
l finished scanning the Defense
Department Troop Selections,

832
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,638
- if you want to see them...
- Not yet. Look at that.

833
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:15,474
- Six Echo drew it.
- lt's elaborate.

834
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:19,783
''Renovachio.'' Renovatee-oh?

835
01:12:19,855 --> 01:12:22,380
Renovatio.
What is that, ltalian?

836
01:12:22,457 --> 01:12:24,448
lt's Latin.

837
01:12:24,893 --> 01:12:27,088
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

838
01:12:27,162 --> 01:12:29,460
Yes, l'm well aware of that.

839
01:12:30,332 --> 01:12:32,698
So where did he learn it?

840
01:12:32,801 --> 01:12:34,792
Where are the results from his scan?

841
01:12:34,903 --> 01:12:38,771
- They'll be back from Johns Hopkins...
- Just speed it up.

842
01:12:38,841 --> 01:12:39,899
Yes, sir.

843
01:12:52,955 --> 01:12:53,944
You two.

844
01:12:54,022 --> 01:12:56,456
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please,

845
01:12:56,525 --> 01:12:59,619
train number 1 7
leaving for San Diego...

846
01:12:59,695 --> 01:13:02,255
- There!
- ...was delayed 20 minutes. Stand by.

847
01:14:50,906 --> 01:14:54,535
We just arrived, but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

848
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:05,211
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

849
01:15:05,287 --> 01:15:06,811
Thanks.

850
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:15,396
Wilshire. 5th. Grand.

851
01:15:15,464 --> 01:15:20,401
Spring. Grand Avenue?
Smile for the camera, sweetheart.

852
01:15:28,677 --> 01:15:32,010
Where is Flower?
You on Flower?

853
01:15:32,614 --> 01:15:35,481
Olive, Olive.
Come on, come on.

854
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:37,609
You look familiar.

855
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:39,346
Gotcha.

856
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,258
Three Black Wasps
and two jet bikes.

857
01:15:44,326 --> 01:15:46,817
We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

858
01:15:46,895 --> 01:15:49,090
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

859
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,692
We're moving! Let's go.

860
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:08,440
Wait. Got a hit
on McCord's credit card.

861
01:16:08,517 --> 01:16:11,077
Location, Grand Avenue at 9830.

862
01:16:11,153 --> 01:16:13,917
Team, proceed immediately to 9830.

863
01:16:13,989 --> 01:16:18,050
No, no, no. LAPD's moving in.
They've flagged McCord's credit card.

864
01:16:18,126 --> 01:16:21,289
- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.

865
01:16:22,597 --> 01:16:25,964
- Not listed.
- Sarah Jordan.

866
01:16:32,808 --> 01:16:33,934
Hello?

867
01:16:34,009 --> 01:16:37,069
Yes, l'm looking for Sarah Jordan.

868
01:16:37,712 --> 01:16:40,112
She's sick.

869
01:16:40,182 --> 01:16:44,312
- Can l talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.

870
01:16:44,386 --> 01:16:46,786
Mommy, is that you?

871
01:17:02,637 --> 01:17:04,969
Jordan. Let's go!

872
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,309
Freeze! Put your hands up!

873
01:17:09,377 --> 01:17:11,777
- Keep your hands off!
- Put your hands up!

874
01:17:11,847 --> 01:17:13,838
Do as l say! Do as l say!

875
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,448
- Lincoln.
- Just do what they say.

876
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:18,986
Lincoln.

877
01:17:19,054 --> 01:17:20,248
- Pull back.
- Move out.

878
01:17:20,322 --> 01:17:21,983
What's going on?

879
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:33,096
Nail it! Quick, move!

880
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:47,011
We're detaining you in connection
to the murder of James McCord.

881
01:17:47,082 --> 01:17:50,245
- What? He was my friend!
- Anything you say can and will be used

882
01:17:50,318 --> 01:17:53,014
- against you in a court of law.
- What's a court of law?

883
01:17:56,625 --> 01:17:59,890
They'll run DNA.
lf the agnates are booked,

884
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:02,987
it'll implicate your clients
in a murder investigation.

885
01:18:03,064 --> 01:18:04,292
This is a nightmare.

886
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:07,300
You cannot allow this to happen.
Do you understand me?

887
01:18:07,369 --> 01:18:09,769
You use any force that is necessary.

888
01:18:09,838 --> 01:18:12,398
l'm ordering you
to contain the situation.

889
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:15,738
1-Adam-82, we've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults, no lD.

890
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:18,472
Notify Forensics,
we'll need DNA typing.

891
01:18:18,547 --> 01:18:21,015
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

892
01:18:21,082 --> 01:18:24,279
- Could you look up my file, please?
- Sit back.

893
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:41,897
Dispatch, we're two minutes out.

894
01:18:51,646 --> 01:18:53,705
- Check inside!
- Hey, can you hear me?

895
01:18:53,782 --> 01:18:56,876
Lincoln, get up!
Get up, Lincoln! Get up!

896
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:04,685
Let's go!

897
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,123
Go! Go! Go!

898
01:19:07,929 --> 01:19:09,021
Go!

899
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:14,394
We got cops. We got cops!

900
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,441
Get down!

901
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:32,887
Run!

902
01:19:33,588 --> 01:19:36,216
l see them! Let's get moving!

903
01:19:37,492 --> 01:19:40,222
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

904
01:19:41,162 --> 01:19:42,561
Move, move!

905
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:44,462
Move out! Move out!

906
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:57,073
Come on!

907
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,616
Go, go, go, go! Go!

908
01:20:19,668 --> 01:20:21,602
Shit! Check up here!

909
01:20:22,804 --> 01:20:24,237
Come on!

910
01:21:00,442 --> 01:21:03,570
Air-Two, give me status of the targets.

911
01:21:04,312 --> 01:21:07,543
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently, take them out.

912
01:21:10,518 --> 01:21:11,576
Go!

913
01:21:14,456 --> 01:21:16,253
Move! Go, go!

914
01:21:16,324 --> 01:21:17,882
- l can't fit!
- Move back!

915
01:21:17,959 --> 01:21:19,221
l can't fit!

916
01:21:37,579 --> 01:21:39,069
Look out, look out!

917
01:21:45,353 --> 01:21:46,752
Right, right, right!

918
01:22:01,503 --> 01:22:02,527
Stay on them!

919
01:22:04,806 --> 01:22:06,273
Look out!

920
01:22:10,779 --> 01:22:13,509
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

921
01:22:36,237 --> 01:22:38,000
Good job!

922
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:42,877
We've gotta bail out of here,
there's police choppers inbound.

923
01:22:51,553 --> 01:22:53,453
Black Wasp, take out the truck!

924
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:06,394
Troy, you all right? Let's go!

925
01:23:11,172 --> 01:23:12,196
Cops! Cops!

926
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:37,327
He's coming back!

927
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:41,229
Stay down, Jordan!

928
01:24:09,464 --> 01:24:12,922
- How do you know what you're doing?
- l don't know!

929
01:25:11,926 --> 01:25:13,223
Hold on!

930
01:25:15,163 --> 01:25:16,323
Look out!

931
01:25:23,705 --> 01:25:24,933
Look out!

932
01:25:32,547 --> 01:25:34,811
Hold on!

933
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:55,635
- Don't let me go, Lincoln!
- l got you! l got you!

934
01:25:55,703 --> 01:25:57,830
- Don't let me go!
- l got you!

935
01:25:58,573 --> 01:26:01,974
l'm slipping!
Don't drop me, Lincoln!

936
01:26:02,076 --> 01:26:05,375
- Don't drop me!
- l got you! l got you!

937
01:26:08,483 --> 01:26:11,611
Lincoln! Pull me! Pull me!

938
01:26:13,454 --> 01:26:15,547
Climb up!

939
01:26:18,559 --> 01:26:21,289
lf there's no way to get
our fugitives quietly,

940
01:26:21,362 --> 01:26:23,626
you need to take them out.

941
01:26:26,868 --> 01:26:29,098
l see our targets about 70 stories up.

942
01:26:29,203 --> 01:26:31,603
They're on top of the building logo.

943
01:26:35,076 --> 01:26:36,771
Tough day.

944
01:26:37,445 --> 01:26:38,878
Let's roll.

945
01:26:40,515 --> 01:26:42,745
LAPD! Get away from the window!

946
01:26:47,121 --> 01:26:48,213
Jay, you got him?

947
01:26:49,924 --> 01:26:51,858
Right there! Right there!
Get him!

948
01:27:00,368 --> 01:27:03,360
Stay there! Damn it!
Just stay down!

949
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:05,496
Come on!

950
01:27:09,143 --> 01:27:11,805
Gonna swing around to get a shot.

951
01:27:17,885 --> 01:27:19,250
He's coming back.

952
01:27:35,369 --> 01:27:36,529
Oh, no.

953
01:27:40,274 --> 01:27:42,708
Hang on!
They're coming off the building.

954
01:28:09,137 --> 01:28:10,968
Look out!

955
01:28:26,454 --> 01:28:27,978
Jesus must love you!

956
01:28:28,055 --> 01:28:30,421
That was the craziest mess
l ever seen!

957
01:28:30,491 --> 01:28:34,154
Come on, girl.
l know Jesus loves you.

958
01:28:44,172 --> 01:28:46,834
Can you keep a secret, doc?

959
01:28:46,908 --> 01:28:48,535
Why, yes, of course.

960
01:28:48,609 --> 01:28:50,873
There is something
going on around here.

961
01:28:50,945 --> 01:28:53,243
Something you may
not even know about.

962
01:28:53,314 --> 01:28:54,372
What is it?

963
01:28:54,448 --> 01:28:59,647
Well, l'm not sure that
the contamination is real.

964
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,711
- Why do you think that?
- OK.

965
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:06,692
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

966
01:29:06,761 --> 01:29:08,285
- Wow.
- Right.

967
01:29:08,362 --> 01:29:11,263
And l think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

968
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:13,994
Have you told
anyone else about this?

969
01:29:14,101 --> 01:29:18,037
No, no. But l'm gonna do some digging.
l'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

970
01:29:18,139 --> 01:29:20,869
And when l do,
l'll share my information with you.

971
01:29:20,942 --> 01:29:22,603
Thank you.

972
01:29:22,677 --> 01:29:24,907
l want to be helpful.
l like it here.

973
01:29:24,979 --> 01:29:26,776
Good.

974
01:29:26,848 --> 01:29:29,316
But l really want to look
into the lottery too.

975
01:29:29,383 --> 01:29:32,477
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

976
01:29:32,553 --> 01:29:34,384
You know,

977
01:29:34,455 --> 01:29:37,015
you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

978
01:29:37,091 --> 01:29:39,286
You're very smart.

979
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,056
Yeah. l remember
when l first came here.

980
01:29:44,765 --> 01:29:47,461
A survivor, just like you.

981
01:29:47,568 --> 01:29:50,162
One of the first, in fact.

982
01:29:50,271 --> 01:29:54,207
lt's natural, even healthy,
to question the world we're presented.

983
01:29:54,308 --> 01:29:57,744
You might say it's only...
only human.

984
01:30:00,214 --> 01:30:02,739
Oh, that burns!

985
01:30:04,518 --> 01:30:08,249
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

986
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,408
l saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

987
01:30:28,509 --> 01:30:31,410
We'll go there when the rain stops.

988
01:30:32,046 --> 01:30:35,174
- lt'll be OK when we find him.
- OK.

989
01:30:40,721 --> 01:30:43,656
That little boy looked like me.

990
01:30:46,794 --> 01:30:49,160
His mom's gonna die, isn't she?

991
01:30:50,298 --> 01:30:51,993
l don't know.

992
01:30:54,869 --> 01:30:56,530
You're lying.

993
01:31:04,278 --> 01:31:06,246
lt's cold.

994
01:31:56,163 --> 01:31:57,357
Go in.

995
01:31:58,099 --> 01:31:59,430
l can't.

996
01:32:00,267 --> 01:32:03,759
- l'll go in.
- Jordan. Jordan!

997
01:32:07,408 --> 01:32:09,205
Hello?

998
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:13,810
Hello?

999
01:33:01,562 --> 01:33:03,223
Lincoln!

1000
01:33:20,347 --> 01:33:22,611
Oh, my God.

1001
01:33:24,885 --> 01:33:27,649
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

1002
01:33:27,721 --> 01:33:30,485
l'm your insurance policy.

1003
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:48,169
And what are you doing in my house?

1004
01:33:53,214 --> 01:33:54,943
Sir, sir.

1005
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:59,709
You need to see this.
lt's a... lt's...

1006
01:34:00,454 --> 01:34:01,648
lt's beautiful.

1007
01:34:01,722 --> 01:34:04,555
This is a synaptic scan
we took of Six Echo three years ago,

1008
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:07,617
before we integrated him
into the agnate population. OK?

1009
01:34:07,695 --> 01:34:11,631
This is his scan from a few days ago.
You can see how much the memory's grown.

1010
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:15,157
Like he's experienced 30 years,
not three, which is impossible.

1011
01:34:15,269 --> 01:34:19,262
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't...

1012
01:34:19,373 --> 01:34:23,537
An infection can't teach you Latin,
or how to fly.

1013
01:34:30,317 --> 01:34:32,615
They are memories.

1014
01:34:34,355 --> 01:34:36,550
But they're not his.

1015
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,889
They belong to his sponsor.

1016
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:42,929
l've seen you before.

1017
01:34:43,998 --> 01:34:46,489
l've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...

1018
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,366
- Maxim?
- Oh, they're men's magazines.

1019
01:34:50,437 --> 01:34:55,500
Pictures of women
with little, tight, short...

1020
01:34:55,576 --> 01:34:59,444
...stories too.
Anyway, you're very popular.

1021
01:35:02,283 --> 01:35:04,148
There we are.

1022
01:35:05,452 --> 01:35:06,919
What is that?

1023
01:35:06,987 --> 01:35:09,182
That looks like some kind of thermal...

1024
01:35:12,059 --> 01:35:15,028
Boy, your skin is so soft.

1025
01:35:15,095 --> 01:35:17,222
Did you know?

1026
01:35:21,936 --> 01:35:24,928
l put some clothes
out for you upstairs.

1027
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:28,202
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1028
01:35:38,118 --> 01:35:40,382
l keep expecting to wake up.

1029
01:35:40,454 --> 01:35:42,820
l thought l was taller.

1030
01:35:43,257 --> 01:35:46,624
l'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

1031
01:35:47,695 --> 01:35:50,528
She is unbelievable.

1032
01:35:50,598 --> 01:35:54,227
How is it you've been around three
years and end up with the kind of woman

1033
01:35:54,335 --> 01:35:57,065
l haven't been able to find
my whole life? Give me that.

1034
01:35:57,171 --> 01:36:00,732
She found me.
She's my best friend.

1035
01:36:00,808 --> 01:36:04,209
- Why do we sound different?
- l'm from Scotland.

1036
01:36:04,278 --> 01:36:06,371
l'm from Scotland.

1037
01:36:06,447 --> 01:36:09,416
Hey, look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

1038
01:36:09,483 --> 01:36:12,748
- Without that.
- No, really, cut it out.

1039
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,811
That's enough.

1040
01:36:14,888 --> 01:36:17,584
Yeah, that is enough.
l'm sorry.

1041
01:36:18,225 --> 01:36:20,216
Like a freak show.

1042
01:36:20,294 --> 01:36:22,353
Yeah, it's weird.

1043
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:29,895
- So, you build boats?
- l design them. l draw them, yeah.

1044
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:32,238
Here.

1045
01:36:32,306 --> 01:36:37,073
l started off with cars, motorcycles.
Experimental designs.

1046
01:36:37,144 --> 01:36:40,477
Anything that blew my hair back.
Kind of a speed freak, you know?

1047
01:36:40,547 --> 01:36:43,015
- Petrol-head.
- Motorcycles, wow.

1048
01:36:43,083 --> 01:36:47,019
- l feel like l've seen these before.
- lt's something l've always done.

1049
01:36:47,087 --> 01:36:49,419
l never dreamt it would make me rich.

1050
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:51,082
What's Renovatio?

1051
01:36:51,158 --> 01:36:53,956
''Renovatio'' in Latin means rebirth.

1052
01:36:54,028 --> 01:36:55,859
Subtle, eh?

1053
01:36:56,363 --> 01:37:00,356
Look. l have cirrhotic hepatitis.

1054
01:37:00,467 --> 01:37:03,368
A parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

1055
01:37:03,871 --> 01:37:05,532
What?

1056
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:08,437
Lots and lots of sex.

1057
01:37:09,543 --> 01:37:12,512
- Sex?
- Sex with...

1058
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,505
You've... You're a virgin?

1059
01:37:17,051 --> 01:37:20,782
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

1060
01:37:22,323 --> 01:37:27,022
OK, l'm not gonna spoil the surprise,
but, boy, are you in for a treat.

1061
01:37:27,094 --> 01:37:31,155
Look, my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

1062
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:39,230
l'm not good at all this shite,
you know? Confessions and regret.

1063
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:44,534
Look.

1064
01:37:44,611 --> 01:37:46,943
There are people who are following us.

1065
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:50,472
They're trying to kill us.
The reason we came is we need your help.

1066
01:37:50,551 --> 01:37:51,711
Help you do what?

1067
01:37:51,785 --> 01:37:54,015
To show people
what the lnstitute does.

1068
01:37:54,655 --> 01:37:57,590
But who'd believe it?
l'm looking at you and l don't.

1069
01:37:58,225 --> 01:38:02,093
Who is that guy? l know him.
ls he the Community Announcer?

1070
01:38:02,162 --> 01:38:03,789
He's the President of America.

1071
01:38:03,864 --> 01:38:06,628
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

1072
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:08,497
Yeah, l never liked him, either.

1073
01:38:08,602 --> 01:38:11,366
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

1074
01:38:11,438 --> 01:38:13,736
Then if we can get
on there together,

1075
01:38:13,807 --> 01:38:15,798
people will see us and know the truth.

1076
01:38:15,909 --> 01:38:18,503
So the idea is that we both
just waltz down to NBC

1077
01:38:18,579 --> 01:38:21,047
and see if they can slot us in
after the weather.

1078
01:38:21,115 --> 01:38:25,313
This might not mean anything to you,
but there are thousands of us.

1079
01:38:25,386 --> 01:38:28,219
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

1080
01:38:35,529 --> 01:38:37,394
Help us.

1081
01:38:40,134 --> 01:38:43,262
All right.
Let me just get my shoes, OK?

1082
01:39:02,089 --> 01:39:04,614
Tom, hurry up!

1083
01:39:08,395 --> 01:39:10,260
Merrick lnstitute.

1084
01:39:11,498 --> 01:39:14,490
- Merrick Biotech. How may l help you?
- This is Tom Lincoln.

1085
01:39:14,601 --> 01:39:17,001
- Hi, Mr. Lincoln.
- l was wondering if you could

1086
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:19,664
get someone who can explain
why my insurance policy

1087
01:39:19,773 --> 01:39:21,934
is sitting downstairs
on my fucking sofa.

1088
01:39:22,509 --> 01:39:25,137
- Can you hold, please?
- Sure.

1089
01:39:36,323 --> 01:39:40,487
l'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
l was getting myself organized.

1090
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:42,859
OK, shall we go?
Are you ready?

1091
01:39:51,572 --> 01:39:53,506
- Something's wrong.
- What?

1092
01:39:55,742 --> 01:39:59,644
His eyes are lying.
The same as yours do.

1093
01:39:59,713 --> 01:40:01,044
You stay here.

1094
01:40:01,114 --> 01:40:03,139
- No, don't...
- Shall we?

1095
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:06,175
- Yeah.
- ls everything OK?

1096
01:40:06,253 --> 01:40:09,347
Yeah. She's gonna stay here
in case they don't believe us.

1097
01:40:09,423 --> 01:40:11,653
No, come on, we'll all go.
lt'll be good.

1098
01:40:11,725 --> 01:40:12,851
No, she's gonna stay.

1099
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,827
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1100
01:40:23,437 --> 01:40:24,768
That's...

1101
01:40:34,314 --> 01:40:37,147
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

1102
01:40:37,217 --> 01:40:40,050
- l'll drive.
- Oh, no. l'll drive.

1103
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,213
No, really.

1104
01:40:42,289 --> 01:40:44,314
Do you know how?

1105
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:48,054
- Yeah, l taught myself.
- But you don't know the way.

1106
01:40:48,128 --> 01:40:50,528
Well, then you can show me.

1107
01:40:53,367 --> 01:40:56,928
Well, be careful.
This is a V-12-09 Caddy.

1108
01:40:57,037 --> 01:41:01,440
Seven hundred and fifty horsepower,
$500,000 car.

1109
01:41:04,311 --> 01:41:05,938
Put your thumb on that.

1110
01:41:08,482 --> 01:41:11,212
You were worth every penny.
We've the same prints.

1111
01:41:11,285 --> 01:41:13,480
- What are you doing?
- Getting directions.

1112
01:41:13,554 --> 01:41:16,318
Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Where would you like to go?

1113
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:18,290
KNBC news studio.

1114
01:41:18,358 --> 01:41:22,294
- One moment, please.
- Thanks for doing this.

1115
01:41:22,362 --> 01:41:26,560
That's all right. l'd like to think
you'd do the same thing if you were me.

1116
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:33,528
- How much did l cost?
- Five million dollars.

1117
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:34,937
ls that a lot?

1118
01:41:35,008 --> 01:41:37,943
lt's a small price to pay
to cheat death.

1119
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,892
That's a red.
lt's a red. Red. Red!

1120
01:41:55,963 --> 01:41:57,794
- Stop the car!
- Why? What? Why?

1121
01:41:57,864 --> 01:42:00,332
lt's a red light! Stop the car!

1122
01:42:03,103 --> 01:42:04,229
What's the matter?

1123
01:42:04,338 --> 01:42:07,774
You wanker! lt's a red light! Stop!
lt means stop!

1124
01:42:07,874 --> 01:42:10,274
- l didn't know that.
- You said you could drive.

1125
01:42:10,344 --> 01:42:14,041
Well, l do know how to drive.
l just don't know what the lights mean.

1126
01:42:20,721 --> 01:42:22,848
l'm sorry. l'm not ready to die.

1127
01:42:26,426 --> 01:42:28,223
Me neither!

1128
01:42:32,799 --> 01:42:33,925
Go, go, go, go!

1129
01:42:36,136 --> 01:42:37,728
- What are you doing? Stop!
- No.

1130
01:42:37,804 --> 01:42:40,034
- Stop the car now!
- No!

1131
01:42:48,949 --> 01:42:50,246
- l'll shoot! Stop!
- No!

1132
01:42:50,317 --> 01:42:52,512
- Yes!
- No!

1133
01:43:02,729 --> 01:43:05,163
There's cars coming at us
in all directions!

1134
01:43:25,485 --> 01:43:26,884
They're shooting my car!

1135
01:43:28,121 --> 01:43:31,147
They've shot the engine!
They've shot my engine!

1136
01:43:31,858 --> 01:43:33,917
Oh, God, my nose!

1137
01:43:57,384 --> 01:44:00,148
Come here! Where'd you think
you were going, eh?

1138
01:44:06,026 --> 01:44:07,357
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

1139
01:44:07,427 --> 01:44:08,758
Get up!

1140
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:12,055
- Get off me!
- Come on, get up!

1141
01:44:12,132 --> 01:44:14,396
- Let me go!
- Get up!

1142
01:44:14,468 --> 01:44:17,960
No, no, no,don't shoot him.
l need him. l need him.

1143
01:44:24,177 --> 01:44:27,112
No, don't shoot!
He's my clone!

1144
01:44:31,718 --> 01:44:34,152
- l'm Tom Lincoln!
- What?

1145
01:44:34,221 --> 01:44:37,088
No, l'm Tom Lincoln! He's lying.

1146
01:44:37,157 --> 01:44:40,752
Shut up! l own you!

1147
01:44:41,394 --> 01:44:44,124
He's the... l'm Tom Lincoln!

1148
01:44:44,197 --> 01:44:46,859
Don't point the gun at me,
you frickin' idiot!

1149
01:44:46,933 --> 01:44:50,460
- He's the clone. Look at him!
- l'm not a clone! l'm Tom!

1150
01:44:50,537 --> 01:44:53,802
No, l'm Tom! He's lying!
Point it at him!

1151
01:44:53,907 --> 01:44:55,636
- No. l'm not.
- Shut up!

1152
01:44:55,742 --> 01:44:58,802
Shut up, you're a clone! Shut up!

1153
01:44:58,912 --> 01:45:00,903
l'm Tom Lincoln!

1154
01:45:00,981 --> 01:45:02,972
- l'm Tom Lincoln!
- Don't, don't...

1155
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:10,518
Oh, shit.

1156
01:45:38,018 --> 01:45:39,952
Close.

1157
01:45:47,127 --> 01:45:51,257
Do you think it's strange that my
insurance policy just tried to kill me?

1158
01:45:51,331 --> 01:45:54,494
l found this whole operation strange.

1159
01:45:54,568 --> 01:45:56,536
Where's the woman?

1160
01:45:56,603 --> 01:45:59,936
She said she was going out of state...

1161
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,507
...to look for her sponsor.

1162
01:46:02,475 --> 01:46:06,639
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

1163
01:46:06,713 --> 01:46:11,707
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

1164
01:46:11,785 --> 01:46:14,185
That kind of secret?

1165
01:46:14,821 --> 01:46:17,654
Have you talked
with anyone else about this?

1166
01:46:17,724 --> 01:46:19,555
Who would believe it?

1167
01:46:19,626 --> 01:46:21,651
Can l count on that?

1168
01:46:21,728 --> 01:46:23,992
The only thing you can count on

1169
01:46:24,064 --> 01:46:27,795
is that people will
do anything to survive.

1170
01:46:27,868 --> 01:46:33,306
l just want to live.
l don't care how.

1171
01:46:37,143 --> 01:46:39,407
Thank you.

1172
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:42,778
Thank you very much.
Job well done.

1173
01:46:49,222 --> 01:46:52,350
Jordan? Jordan?

1174
01:46:52,425 --> 01:46:54,757
Stop.

1175
01:46:56,696 --> 01:47:00,154
Hey, Jordan, it's me. lt's me.

1176
01:47:18,551 --> 01:47:20,610
lt's you.

1177
01:47:46,913 --> 01:47:51,043
- Wow, that tongue thing is amazing.
- l know. Open your mouth again.

1178
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:56,088
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

1179
01:48:19,512 --> 01:48:22,208
The lsland is real.

1180
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:24,846
lt's us.

1181
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:30,822
- How many are affected?
- About half.

1182
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:33,984
We're seeing the same
neural patterns in all of the Echos,

1183
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:38,019
plus every subsequent generation:
the Foxtrots, Gammas and Helos.

1184
01:48:38,098 --> 01:48:41,761
We predicated
our entire system on predictability.

1185
01:48:41,835 --> 01:48:46,238
Six Echo has displayed
the one trait that undermines it:

1186
01:48:46,339 --> 01:48:48,807
Human curiosity.

1187
01:48:50,043 --> 01:48:55,310
So... we're now
facing four generations

1188
01:48:55,382 --> 01:48:58,647
with the potential
for defiant behavior.

1189
01:48:59,819 --> 01:49:01,980
What are you suggesting?

1190
01:49:02,055 --> 01:49:04,182
A recall.

1191
01:49:04,691 --> 01:49:09,185
Wait, you mean dispose of over
200 million dollars' worth of product?

1192
01:49:09,262 --> 01:49:11,890
- Yes.
- Great.

1193
01:49:11,965 --> 01:49:15,867
Cisco lP Communicator.
Connecting to Merrick Biotech.

1194
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:21,967
This is Charlie Whitman, the public
relations director at Merrick Biotech.

1195
01:49:22,075 --> 01:49:25,340
My deepest apologies for yesterday's

1196
01:49:25,412 --> 01:49:28,848
unfortunate inconvenience you had.

1197
01:49:28,915 --> 01:49:33,318
Your defect in your policy wasn't,
by no means, an isolated incident,

1198
01:49:33,386 --> 01:49:36,321
and it is totally correctable,
l assure you.

1199
01:49:36,389 --> 01:49:39,916
We are calling other
valued clients right now

1200
01:49:39,993 --> 01:49:43,429
to inform them of a recall,
so, please, call us when you get in...

1201
01:49:44,631 --> 01:49:46,929
Unfortunate inconvenience?

1202
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,161
That's a bit of an understatement.

1203
01:49:49,235 --> 01:49:52,295
Mr. Lincoln, you're home.
Aren't you traumatized, sir?

1204
01:49:52,405 --> 01:49:55,841
l mean, l had a home invasion once
where they put the gun to my head.

1205
01:49:55,942 --> 01:49:58,433
l never forgot that.
l shook for two days.

1206
01:49:58,545 --> 01:50:00,945
What kind of recall
are you talking about?

1207
01:50:01,014 --> 01:50:05,178
Oh, it's a small defect that we found
in four of our product lines.

1208
01:50:05,251 --> 01:50:08,152
What are you gonna do
with the defective products?

1209
01:50:10,223 --> 01:50:11,520
Starting over.

1210
01:50:13,493 --> 01:50:16,519
- Starting over?
- Absolutely nothing to worry about.

1211
01:50:16,596 --> 01:50:18,826
We guarantee
our product 100 percent.

1212
01:50:18,898 --> 01:50:22,197
The unfortunate inconvenience for you

1213
01:50:22,268 --> 01:50:26,762
is we're gonna have to re-scan you
so that we can re-grow your policy.

1214
01:50:26,873 --> 01:50:31,276
Does today work for you at all?
Pick you up by helicopter at 3:00?

1215
01:50:31,344 --> 01:50:33,608
l'll call you back.

1216
01:50:41,287 --> 01:50:42,914
Dr. Merrick,

1217
01:50:42,989 --> 01:50:46,288
how do we remove the
defective products from the population

1218
01:50:46,359 --> 01:50:49,089
without disrupting the others?

1219
01:50:49,162 --> 01:50:51,528
We already have the mechanism in place.

1220
01:50:52,732 --> 01:50:55,929
Dahlgren Two Foxtrot.

1221

Mass winnings.

1223
01:51:05,145 --> 01:51:08,876
He kept a journal
and a lot of maps.

1224
01:51:08,948 --> 01:51:11,576
After l figure out how
to get that thing in the water,

1225
01:51:11,651 --> 01:51:14,176
then we can get on it and...

1226
01:51:14,254 --> 01:51:16,085
...we'll keep heading south.

1227
01:51:16,156 --> 01:51:18,386
We could live like real people.

1228
01:51:18,458 --> 01:51:21,256
Tulie Two Foxtrot.

1229

Ginsberg Two Helo.

1230
01:51:27,267 --> 01:51:29,064
We'll disappear.

1231
01:51:29,636 --> 01:51:31,001
Yeah.

1232
01:51:32,272 --> 01:51:34,672
But after.

1233
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:46,275
All those people we left behind.

1234
01:51:46,352 --> 01:51:49,185
Jones Three Echo.

1235
01:52:06,272 --> 01:52:08,900
When we were escaping,

1236
01:52:09,008 --> 01:52:10,475
l saw this room.

1237
01:52:11,344 --> 01:52:14,177
lf l could get in
and shut it down,

1238
01:52:14,247 --> 01:52:16,545
they'd see the truth.

1239
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:29,588
Gentlemen, there is, however, another
matter that requires board approval.

1240
01:52:33,032 --> 01:52:36,365
The disposal of 200 million dollars
of infected product.

1241
01:52:43,376 --> 01:52:45,003
All in favor?

1242
01:52:45,111 --> 01:52:46,078
- Aye.
- Aye.

1243
01:52:46,179 --> 01:52:47,669
Aye.

1244
01:53:01,527 --> 01:53:02,926
You've been chosen.

1245
01:53:03,863 --> 01:53:05,262
You're special.

1246
01:53:07,834 --> 01:53:09,631
Very special.

1247
01:53:15,508 --> 01:53:17,874
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1248
01:53:17,944 --> 01:53:19,036
Thanks.

1249
01:53:24,117 --> 01:53:25,106
Here you go.

1250
01:53:25,184 --> 01:53:28,881
- And what do you say to the nice lady?
- Thank you!

- Escort her to Surgery Prep Seven.
- l better say hello.

1253
01:55:05,585 --> 01:55:07,553
Mr. Lincoln, thank you for coming.

1254
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:10,350
lt's great seeing you again,
and we are so, so sorry

1255
01:55:10,423 --> 01:55:12,482
about this entire episode.

1256
01:55:12,558 --> 01:55:15,152
l want to tell you that
we are going to be birthing

1257
01:55:15,228 --> 01:55:17,458
a brand new agnate for you
free of charge.

1258
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:20,829
Won't cost you a penny. After you.

1259
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:23,733
Would you like an apple?
An afternoon snack...?

1260
01:55:23,803 --> 01:55:26,897
- No. How long will this take?
- lt's gonna take about an hour.

1261
01:55:27,006 --> 01:55:29,600
l read that you're from Scotland.
l prefer lreland.

1262
01:55:29,709 --> 01:55:31,301
But what part in Scotland...?

1263
01:55:31,411 --> 01:55:34,380
l realize that this small talk
is just part of yourjob,

1264
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,779
- but let's cut the shite, OK?
- Point taken. My apologies.

1265
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:40,250
l'm just a bit of a jabberjaw.
Chatty Cathy.

1266
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:42,651
Turn right. This way.

1267
01:55:49,495 --> 01:55:51,395
l'll take her.

1268
01:56:03,075 --> 01:56:05,703
This is gonna be the exact
same routine as last time.

1269
01:56:05,812 --> 01:56:08,474
Mind the hose.
Technician will be here.

1270
01:56:08,548 --> 01:56:12,951
Look at you, so young and successful.
l always wanted to get into yachting.

1271
01:56:24,597 --> 01:56:26,758
l hear they're taking your kidneys,

1272
01:56:27,567 --> 01:56:31,697
your lungs, your heart.

1273
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:34,934
They are gonna hack you up.

1274
01:56:40,613 --> 01:56:42,342
Too bad.

1275
01:56:57,163 --> 01:56:59,028
No one is touching me.

1276
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:03,330
- Give me your Tri-Key.
- You shot me.

1277
01:57:03,402 --> 01:57:06,235
Shut up! Give me your walkie!

1278
01:57:09,442 --> 01:57:11,410
Get down. Get down, now!

1279
01:57:55,087 --> 01:57:57,555
- You all right?
- Yes.

1280
01:57:58,824 --> 01:58:00,451
Come on.

1281
01:58:01,994 --> 01:58:03,689
l've got this figured out.

1282
01:58:03,763 --> 01:58:05,253
l kind of...

1283
01:58:05,331 --> 01:58:09,392
l messed it up in one area right down
in there, but the hole doesn't matter.

1284
01:58:09,468 --> 01:58:12,665
Something's happening.
Something's happening.

1285
01:58:13,239 --> 01:58:14,706
Hello, sir. Hello.

1286
01:58:14,807 --> 01:58:16,570
Thank you for your patience.

1287
01:58:16,676 --> 01:58:19,076
l'm sure you're excited
to get to the lsland.

1288
01:58:19,145 --> 01:58:22,478
lf you grab your belongings
and line up in a single-file line

1289
01:58:22,548 --> 01:58:24,675
and follow me,
we'll be on our way.

1290
01:58:26,118 --> 01:58:30,714
Take this. Go.
You have to keep going.

1291
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:32,758
- Go. Go.
- OK.

1292
01:58:32,825 --> 01:58:34,725
Go shut it down.

1293
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,372
l love that Picasso.

1294
01:58:51,243 --> 01:58:54,007
Do you like Picasso, Mr. Laurent?

1295
01:58:55,114 --> 01:58:59,483
You delivered on your promise.
Well done. l'm very pleased. Thank you.

1296
01:58:59,552 --> 01:59:01,884
What about the client?
Sarah Jordan?

1297
01:59:01,954 --> 01:59:03,046
She's doubtful.

1298
01:59:03,122 --> 01:59:05,056
Even if the transplant's a success,

1299
01:59:05,124 --> 01:59:08,560
her brain damage may be too severe
for any real recovery.

1300
01:59:08,628 --> 01:59:10,892
You took too long bringing her back.

1301
01:59:10,963 --> 01:59:13,796
The girl, you're going to harvest her,
kill her anyway,

1302
01:59:13,866 --> 01:59:15,993
even though it won't
make any difference?

1303
01:59:16,769 --> 01:59:20,762
That's the privilege our clients
pay for, Mr. Laurent.

1304
01:59:20,873 --> 01:59:25,367
Now, do excuse me,
l have business to attend to.

1305
01:59:26,379 --> 01:59:30,281
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabe Rebellion?

1306
01:59:30,349 --> 01:59:34,445
And when he was killed,
me and my brothers were branded,

1307
01:59:36,722 --> 01:59:40,590
so others would know
we were less than human.

1308
01:59:41,293 --> 01:59:45,491
l've seen and done things l'm not proud
of, but at some point you realize war...

1309
01:59:46,799 --> 01:59:48,562
...is a business.

1310
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:56,107
So when did killing
become a business for you?

1311
02:00:02,181 --> 02:00:05,480
Oh, it's so much more than that.

1312
02:00:07,953 --> 02:00:11,719
l have discovered the Holy Grail
of science, Mr. Laurent.

1313
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:13,418
l give life.

1314
02:00:13,826 --> 02:00:17,421
The agnates,
they're simply tools, instruments.

1315
02:00:17,496 --> 02:00:20,363
They have no souls.

1316
02:00:20,766 --> 02:00:23,496
The possibilities are endless here.

1317
02:00:23,569 --> 02:00:27,528
ln two years' time, l will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

1318
02:00:27,606 --> 02:00:31,007
How many people on Earth
can say that, Mr. Laurent?

1319
02:00:32,778 --> 02:00:34,678
l guess just you and God.

1320
02:00:38,451 --> 02:00:41,443
That's the answer
you're looking for, isn't it?

1321
02:00:46,525 --> 02:00:49,153
Mr. Whitman has your check downstairs.

1322
02:00:56,535 --> 02:00:59,197
Looks like single gunshot.

1323
02:01:01,707 --> 02:01:03,470
Oh, no.

1324
02:01:04,343 --> 02:01:05,742
Wrong wrist.

1325
02:01:05,811 --> 02:01:10,180
Dr. Merrick,
the body thatjust came in...

1326
02:01:10,249 --> 02:01:12,979
...is the client.

1327
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:27,458
lssue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

1328
02:01:32,271 --> 02:01:35,240
Down, down, down!
Move, move!

1329
02:01:48,521 --> 02:01:51,422
- Disturbance in the Hologram Room.
- l'm on it.

1330
02:01:53,492 --> 02:01:56,723
Dr. Merrick, l sent censors
to check a possible attempted breach

1331
02:01:56,796 --> 02:01:58,730
in Hologram Control.

1332
02:02:39,705 --> 02:02:42,105
One after another,
step into the room.

1333
02:02:42,174 --> 02:02:44,699
lf l'm going to the lsland,
why did l leave my bag?

1334
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:46,471
Step right in, thank you.

1335
02:02:47,413 --> 02:02:51,372
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
ls this the right way? l...

1336
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:54,180
Are you new here?
l don't know if this is the way!

1337
02:02:54,253 --> 02:02:56,721
lt's going to the lsland!

1338
02:02:58,390 --> 02:03:01,154
l'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

1339
02:03:05,731 --> 02:03:07,426
Open the door!

1340
02:03:12,972 --> 02:03:15,964
She said open the door!

1341
02:03:51,210 --> 02:03:56,045
You could have taken over his life,
but you chose to come back.

1342
02:03:56,115 --> 02:03:58,845
You truly are unique, Six Echo.

1343
02:03:59,585 --> 02:04:01,780
My name is Lincoln!

1344
02:05:20,499 --> 02:05:22,524
l brought you into this world...

1345
02:05:28,941 --> 02:05:30,772
...and l can take you out of it.
