当然了， 我是美国唯一胜任此项工作的人.
Sure. Sure. I was the only man in America qualified for this job.

64
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:51,051
你知道我不是首选， 也不是末选.
You know I wasn't the first choice, nor even the tenth.

65
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,218
 你知道，我知道  什么意思?
 You know it, I know it.  What do you mean?

66
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:59,101

你必须全力面对

For only a judge knows how much more a court is than a courtroom.

137
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,897
它是一种程序和精神
It is a process and a spirit.

138
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:08,028
是法律的殿堂
It is the house of Iaw.

139
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:13,943
被告们也都熟悉法律.
The defendants knew this too. They knew courtrooms well.

140
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,579
他们穿着法官袍 却扭曲了法律,
They sat in their black robes and they distorted, they perverted,

141
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,544
毁坏了德国法律的正义.
they destroyed justice and Iaw in Germany.

142
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,370
公诉人请留意灯.
The prosecution will please watch the Iight.

143
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:28,125
 翻译跟不上你的速度.  对不起，法官大人
 The interpreter cannot follow you.  I'm sorry, Your Honour.

144
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:31,511
他们扭曲法律
They distorted, they perverted,

145
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,340
曲解正义.
they destroyed justice and Iaw in Germany.

146
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,019
这无疑是重大的犯罪
This in itself is undoubtedly a great crime.

147
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:43,398
但是检查团不是要控诉被告
But the prosecution is not calling the defendants to account

148
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:49,315
藐视法律
for violating constitutional guaranties or withholding due process of Iaw.

149
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:53,945
检查团控诉被告谋杀,
The prosecution is calling them to account for murder,

150
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,904
暴行,
brutalities,

151
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:03,082
拷打等残酷行为,
torture, atrocities!

152
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:06,712
他们同第三帝国的领导者是同谋,
They share, with all the Ieaders of the Third Reich,

153
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:10,424
应该为所有的恶行负责,
responsibility for the most malignant, the most calculated,

154
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:14,847
对全人类负责.
the most devastating crimes in the history of all mankind.

155
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,761
他们的罪孽比其他人可能还要重,
They are perhaps more guilty than some of the others,

156
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:23,268
因为在西特勒上台以前他们就在这样操作.
for they had attained maturity Iong before Hitler's rise to power.

157
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,357
他们的思想在纳粹催化前就成熟了.
Their minds weren't warped at an early age by Nazi teachings.

158
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:33,909
本该是重视正义的时候,
They embraced the ideologies of the Third Reich as educated adults,

159
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:38,780
他们却如此教育德国.
when they, most of all, should have valued justice.

160
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:48,922
这里他们将要接受他们拒绝的正义.
Here they'II receive the justice they denied others.

161
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:55,426
他们将当庭根据所有证据被判决.
They'II be judged according to the evidence presented in this courtroom.

162
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,012
公诉人发言完毕.
The prosecution asks nothing more.

163
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:05,930
罗尔福致开幕词
Herr Rolfe will make the opening statement for the defence.

164
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:21,366
(speaks German)

165
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:24,204
尊敬的法官席.
(interpreter) May it please the tribunal.

166
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:26,209
(speaks German)

167
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:30,667
这是荣誉...
(interpreter) It is not only a great honour...

168
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,876
也是挑战...
but also a great challenge...

169
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:39,557
像舆论倡导的一样...
for an advocate...to aid this tribunal in its task.

170
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,356
整个世界都在关注这次的审判
The entire civilised world will follow closely what we do here.

171
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:51,569
因为这不是普通的审判,
For this is not an ordinary trial,

172
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:55,610
无论如何这不是一般意义的审判.
by any means of the accepted parochial sense.

173
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:59,194
审判的目的
The avowed purpose of this tribunal

174
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,955
远非只是审理这么几个人
(in English) is broader than the visiting of retribution on a few men.

175
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:10,418
这是献身于正义的殿堂.
It is dedicated to the reconsecration of the temple of justice.

176
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:16,883
这是为了寻找全世界应该负责的正义.
It is dedicated to finding a code of justice the whole world will be responsible to.

177
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:23,345
这样的原则如何确立?
How will this code be established?

178
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:27,895
这就要客观的评价
It will be established

179
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:38,161
真实准确的衡量检查官
in a clear, honest evaluation of the responsibility for the crimes

180
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:42,033
所指控的犯罪
in the indictment stated by the prosecution.

181
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:47,584
引用美国法理学家 奥立弗·温德尔·福尔摩斯的话说,
In the words of the great American jurist OIiver Wendell Holmes,

182
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:54,006
"这种责任不仅要在表面文档查找
"This responsibility will not be found only in documents that no one contests or denies."

183
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:59,294
"而是要从社会的本质中探询."
"It will be found in considerations of a political or social nature."

184
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:06,393
"最重要的还是要探索人性."
"It will be found, most of all, in the character of men."

185
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:12,142
欧内斯特·姜宁的人性如何?
What is the character of Ernst Janning?

186
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,904
让我们简略回顾他的人生吧.
Let us examine his Iife for a moment.

187
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:20,363
他出生于1885年
He was born in 1 885.

188
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:23,280
在1907年获得法学博士学位.
Received the degree of Doctor of Law in 1 907.

189
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:26,164
在1914年成为东普鲁士的一名法官.
Became a judge in East Prussia in 1 91 4.

190
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,825
在“一战”期间
Following World War I, he became one of the Weimar Republic Ieaders

191
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,831
他是魏玛宪法的倡导和立法者之一.
and one of the framers of its democratic constitution.

192
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:35,669
接下来的数年
In subsequent years, he achieved international fame

193
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,964
他不仅以法理学家出名， 他的著作也享誉全球
not only for his work as a great jurist, but also as the author of Iegal textbooks

194
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:43,013
现今他的著作还在被引用.
which are still used in universities all over the world.

195
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:47,352
他在1935年担任德国司法部长.
He became Minister of Justice in Germany in 1 935.

196
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:51,308
如果欧内斯特·姜宁被判有罪,
If Ernst Janning is to be found guilty,

197
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,774
就会发生一系列牵连.
certain implications must arise.

198
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:58,776
法官不是立法者.
A judge does not make the Iaws.

199
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:03,864
他是为国家执行法律
He carries out the Iaws of his country.

200
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:08,740
如同这样陈述 "我的国家，没有对与错"
The statement "My country, right or wrong"

201
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,535
这是美国爱国诗人的语句
was expressed by a great American patriot.

202
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:18,291
对于德国的爱国者也一样适用.
It is no Iess true for a German patriot.

203
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:25,467
难道欧内斯特·姜宁不应该执行法律?
Should Ernst Janning have carried out the Iaws of his country?

204
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,060
难道他应该做一个拒绝执法的叛国者?
Or should he have refused to carry them out and become a traitor?

205
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:34,933
这是这次审判的焦点.
This is the crux of the issue at the bottom of this trial.

206
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:42,404
在控诉中
The defence is as dedicated to finding responsibility

207
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,573
被告被控诉需要负责
as is the prosecution.

208
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:50,575
这已经不是审理欧内斯特·姜宁的问题了.
For it is not only Ernst Janning who is on trial here.

209
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,203
而是对全德国人民的审判
It is the German people.

210
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:03,834
现在休庭.
The tribunal will recess until further notification.

211
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,460
Yeah.

212
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:46,004
如果没有问题， 柏尔斯待会就会整理好文档了.
If it's all right with you, Byers can file these briefs Iater.

213
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:50,682
劳森上校的演说很糟糕不是吗?
It was quite a damning speech by Colonel Lawson, wasn't it?

214
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,920
我真怀疑他的控诉
I wonder if those men in the dock can really be responsible

215
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,305
能否成立
for the things he Iisted in the indictment.

216
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,848
我到这已经有两年多了
I've been here two years, and after that Iong

217
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:03,279
你会发现责任不是事先就准备好了的.
you find that responsibility is not a cut-and-dried thing.

218
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,529
周末你有什么安排?
What are you fellows up to this weekend?

219
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,983
我和太太要去里奇
My wife and I are going to Liege.

220
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,408
那里什么都没有啊， 我去过.
There's nothing in Liege. I've been there.

221
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,495
我儿子的第101天忌日.
My son was in the 1 01 st.

222
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:16,039
他葬在那里的美国公墓.
He's buried in the American cemetery outside Liege.

223
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:18,838
 对不起.  没关系.
 I'm sorry.  That's all right.

224
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,789
 星期一见，丹.  恩.
 See you Monday, Dan.  Mm.

225
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,217
 一起走吗?  不，还要等会
 Coming my way?  No, I'm staying here for a moment.

226
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:28,671
我在等柏尔斯的记录
I'm waiting for some records from Byers.

227
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,846
好
Right.

228
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:56,706
 这里是你要的报告，先生.  谢谢
 Here are the reports you asked for, sir.  Thank you.

229
00:21:57,627 --> 00:22:02,372
上尉， 你可以帮我找欧内斯特·姜宁写的书吗?
Captain, do you think you could get me a copy of the books Ernst Janning wrote?

230
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:05,626
 只怕很少  我想都要
 There are quite a few of them.  I'd Iike all of them.

231
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,544
还有可以帮我找一份魏玛宪法的复印本吗?
And also a copy of the Weimar constitution. Can you get that for me?

232
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:12,598
 当然 -谢谢.
 Yes, of course.  Thank you.

233
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:19,105
 你到这有多久了，上尉?  两年
 How Iong have you been here, Captain?  Two years.

234
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:22,067
 两年，那算很久了  是
 Two years, that's a Iong time.  Yes, sir.

235
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:24,274
 有朋友吗?  当然
 Any friends?  Sure.

236
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:28,979
 德国朋友?  是
 German friends?  Yes.

237
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:32,194
 女孩?  是
 A girl?  Yes.

238
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:36,412
她的父母是纳粹， 但她当时只有9岁
Her parents were Nazis, but she was eight when they came in.

239
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,292
 我没有问你这个  或许你在这么想
 I didn't ask you that.  Maybe you were thinking it.

240
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,791
很自然会想到的
It's natural to think about it.

241
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:45,586
我想如果有人要介绍她， 最好还是我
I thought if anybody was going to indoctrinate her, it might as well be me.

242
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:49,501
 还有事吗?  不，我想在镇上走走.
 Will there be anything else?  No. I think I'II take a walk around town.

243
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:52,175
可以到老区喝一杯的.
Try the old section for a beer and a sausage.

244
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,346
谢谢
Thank you.

245
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:26,503
Nicht mehr! Nicht mehr!

Auf Wiedersehen, Opa.

 你懂英语吗?  会一点
 Do you understand English?  Yes, a Iittle.

 她说什么?  她说 "再见，爷爷."
 What did she say?  She said "Goodbye, Grandpa."

我们在美国权威机构还是有朋友的.
We still have some friends who have contact with the American authorities.

我们都处于非常尴尬的境地
we are both in an embarrassing position.

我知道你不希望我来做你的律师

在法庭上没有同情.
there will be no falling at the mercy of the court.

它有自己的游戏规则.
The game will be played according to their own rules.

00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:48,913
我们到要看看他们是否有胆量审判你这样的人.
We'II see whether they have the courage to sit in judgment on a man Iike you.

269
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:51,166
在我看来
The way I see it,

270
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:59,125
案子的关键是里萨法案
the most important elements in the case are the sterilisation decrees

271
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:02,761
还有费尔德斯坦·霍夫曼的案子
and the Feldenstein-Hoffman affair.

272
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:09,011
姜宁博士
Doctor Janning,

273
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:11,388
我必须告诉你一些事情
I must tell you something.

274
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:21,026
当我在大学时我就仰慕你
I admired you since I was a boy in the university.

275
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:25,778
那是因为我想
It was because I thought I might be able to achieve

276
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:28,831
我也可以追求你所获得的成就
some of the things you have done

277
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:33,786
即使在战争时期也是如此
that saw me through the war.

278
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:40,592
你是我们的偶像
You have been somebody to Iook up to for all of us.

279
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:45,219
说完了吗, 罗夫曼?
Is that all, Herr Rolfe?

280
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,810
 是  谢谢
 Yes.  Thank you.

281
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:05,943
威克博士， 你认识被告欧内斯特·姜宁吗?
Dr Wieck, do you know the defendant Ernst Janning?

282
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:11,371
是，我认识
Yes, I know him.

283
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:14,039
可以告诉我们如何认识的吗?
Will you tell us in what capacity?

284
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,627
在1929到1935我们一起在司法部工作.
We served in the Ministry of Justice together from 1 929 till 1 935.

285
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,429
 在这之前你们认识吗?  是，他是我的学生.
 Did you know him before that?  Yes. He was a Iaw student of mine.

286
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,300
 你了解他吗？  是
 Did you know him well?  Yes.

287
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,260
 他是受你教导吗?  是.
 Was he a protege of yours?  Yes.

288
00:28:29,394 --> 00:28:31,682
为什么?
Why?

289
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:35,810
因为他是个很聪明的人.
He was always a man of great intelligence.

290
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:40,770
他天生有法律的头脑.
He was a man born with the qualities of a great Iegal mind.

291
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:43,941
威克博士...
Dr Wieck, would you, uh...

292
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:48,284
你能否从你的角度告诉我们,
would you tell us, from your own experience,

293
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:54,747
德国司法部是否受阿道夫·西特勒控制?
the position of the judge in Germany prior to the advent of Adolf Hitler?

294
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:58,412
司法部是独立的.
The position of the judge was one of complete independence.

295
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:00,006
恩
Mm-hm.

296
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:04,082
那你如何解释
Now would you describe the contrast, if any,

297
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,087
在1933年纳粹上台以后的情况
after the coming to power of National Socialism in 1 933?

298
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:14,681
法官们要被迫接受一些权力的改变.
Judges became subject to something outside of objective justice.

299
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:20,401
他们受国家利益支配.
They were subject to what was necessary for the protection of the country.

300
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:24,442
-你可以解释一下吗?  首先要替法官考虑的是
 Would you explain this, please?  The first consideration of the judge

301
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:28,111
他们没有对抗国会的权力,
became the punishment of acts against the state

302
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,830
rather than objective consideration of the case.

303
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:34,493
还有什么变化吗?
And what other changes were there?

304
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,374
上诉权也被取消了.
The right to appeal was eliminated.

305
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:45,006
最高法院被人民特殊法院取代了.
The Supreme Court of the Reich was replaced by peoples' and special courts.

306
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:51,089
种族概念第一次写入了法律.
The concept of race was made a Iegal concept for the first time.

307
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,228
结果如何?
And what was the result of this?

308
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,435
结果?
The result?

309
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:01,558
结果是移交了司法部的权力
The result was to hand over the administration of justice

310
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:04,529
变成了专政
into the hands of the dictatorship.

311
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:06,565
 威克博士....  劳森上校,
 Dr Wieck....  Colonel Lawson,

312
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:09,617
我想问几个问题.
I'd Iike to ask a few questions.

313
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:14,287
司法部是否有对此提出抗议?
Did the judiciary protest these Iaws abridging their independence?

314
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:20,002
有一些人提出， 其他的都顺从或被迫顺从了.
A few of them did. Those who did resigned or were forced to resign.

315
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:22,836
其他的...
Others...

316
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:27,216
就直接顺应新局势了.
adapted themselves to the new situation.

317
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:33,596
司法部是否有意识到巨大的转变?
Do you think the judiciary was aware of the consequences to come?

318
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:35,849
起初或许没有
At first, perhaps not.

319
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:41,649
后来只要是人就都知道了.
Later it became clear to anyone who had eyes and ears.

320
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:43,151
谢谢
Thank you.

321
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:49,113
你可否告诉我们刑法方面的修改.
Now, would you please describe for us the changes in criminal Iaw.

322
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:56,078
明显的特征是死刑条款增多了.
Its characteristic was an ever-increasing inflation of the death penalty.

323
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:59,042
只要是波兰人或犹太人
Sentences were passed against defendants

324
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:05,254
都要受到审判.
just because they were Poles or Jews, or politically undesirable.

325
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:09,297
纳粹的衡量方法也被引进,
Novel National Socialist measures were introduced,

326
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:15,265
对人种进行分类.
among them sexual sterilisation for those who were categorised as asocial.

327
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:22,309
在1935年法官是否需要特别标记?
Was it necessary for judges to wear any distinctive mark on their robes in 1 935?

328
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:25,312
这就是所谓的 "法萨法案"
The so-called "Fuhrer's decree"

329
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:29,531
要求法官穿上十字记号的法官袍.
required judges to wear the insignia of the swastika on their robes.

330
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:33,240
 你有佩带吗?  不
 Did you wear such an insignia?  No.

331
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,409
我以此为耻.
I would have been ashamed to wear it.

332
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:40,081
 在1935年你是否辞职?  是
 Did you resign in 1 935?  Yes, sir.

333
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:44,124
欧内斯特·姜宁有穿上吗?
Did Ernst Janning wear a swastika on his robe?

334
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:49,668
是
Yes.

335
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:52,554
问毕。谢谢
That's all. Thank you.

336
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,636
罗尔福
Herr Rolfe.

337
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:08,567
Herr Justizrat Dr Wieck.

338
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:15,947
你刚才提到 "出于保护国家的必要."
You used the phrase "necessary for the protection of the country."

339
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,617
你可以说明一下
Would you explain the conditions in Germany

340
00:32:18,748 --> 00:32:22,033
当时德国的情况吗?
at the time National Socialism came to power?

341
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:24,208
什么情况?
What conditions?

342
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:29,373
当时有饥荒?
Would you say there was widespread hunger?

343
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:30,540
是
Yes.

344
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:33,298
还有国内的不统一?
Would you say there was internal disunity?

345
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:34,674
是
Yes.

346
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:37,723
 有共产党吗?  是
 Was there a Communist Party?  Yes.

347
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,057
是德国的第三大党吗?
Was it the third Iargest party in Germany?

348
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:42,095
是
Mm... yes.

349
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,944
你是不是要说纳粹某种程度上拯救了国家?
Would you say that National Socialism helped to cure some of these conditions?

350
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,486
是，但付出了惨重的代价...
Yes, but at a terrible price, and...

351
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:57,491
请你直接回答问题就可以了.
PIease, confine yourself to answering the questions only.

352
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,071
那么，一个法官如果不穿那样的法官袍
Therefore, was it not possible that a judge might wear a swastika

353
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:04,243
他是否还有可能继续为他的国家工作?
and yet work for what he thought was best for his country?

354
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:07,247
不，不可能
No. It was not possible.

355
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,881
Dr Wieck,

356
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:21,719
据你所说,
you were not in the administration from the years 1 935 to 1 943,

357
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:24,557
1935 到 1943 年你不在行政部门
by your own admission.

358
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:31,937
你是否可能知道行政部门被扭曲?
Is it not possible that your view of the administration might be distorted?

359
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:34,064
不
No, it is not.

360
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:40,911
那你怎么可以对行政部门作证?
How can you testify about events in the administration if you were not there?

361
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,993
在政府机构我有很多朋友
I had many friends in the Iegal administration.

362
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,996
那里有期刊和书籍
There were journals and books.

363
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:50,921
期刊和书籍?
From journals and books?

364
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,758
我明白了
I see.

365
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,931
你刚才提到
Dr Wieck, you referred to "novel National Socialist measures introduced,

366
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:06,264
纳粹的衡量方法被引进
among them sexual sterilisation."

367
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:10,644
那你是否知道里萨法案不是纳粹原创呢,
Are you aware that sexual sterilisation was not invented by National Socialism,

368
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:13,694
而是在数年前
but had been advanced for years before as a weapon

369
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:17,155
针对处理不合格的囚犯制定的?
in dealing with the mentally incompetent and the criminal?

370
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:18,943
是，我知道
Yes, I am aware of that.

371
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:22,944
你是否知道这在其他国家也被倡导?
Are you aware it has advocates among Ieading citizens in many countries?

372
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:25,951
我不是这方面的专家
I am not an expert on such Iaws.

373
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:29,836
允许我为你读一段.
Then permit me to read one to you.

374
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:35,541
这是最高法院意见
This is a High Court opinion

375
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:40,303
这在别国法律中存在.
upholding such Iaws in existence in another country.

376
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,889
我来引用..
And I quote..

377
00:34:48,314 --> 00:34:51,315
"我们不止一次见到社会福利
"We have seen more than once that the public welfare

378
00:34:51,442 --> 00:34:54,147
谋求最高利益."
may call upon their best citizens for their Iives."

379
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:57,149
"如果是为了整体利益
"It would be strange indeed if it could not call upon

380
00:34:57,281 --> 00:35:01,808
局部的牺牲是可以理解的
those who already sap the strength of the state for these Iesser sacrifices

381
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:05,244
in order to prevent our being swamped by incompetence."

382
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:09,501
"对于低能劣等的罪犯
"It is better if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime

383
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:11,966
or to Iet them starve for their imbecility,

384
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:18,506
社会应该在第一时间处理他们
society can prevent their propagation by medical means in the first place."

385
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,678
"三代的愚蠢已经足够了."
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough."

386
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:31,647
 现在你想起来了吗，威克博士?  不，没有
 Do you recognise it now, Dr Wieck?  No, sir, I don't.

387
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,315
事实上你也不知道,
Actually, there is no particular reason you should,

388
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:40,360
因为这是引用自,
since the opinion upholds the sterilisation Iaw in the state of Virginia,

389
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,698
美国维吉尼亚法案
of the United States,

390
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:45,532
美国法理学家
and was written by that great American jurist

391
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:51,333
奥立弗·温德尔·福尔摩斯
Supreme Court Justice OIiver Wendell Holmes.

392
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:03,840
Now, Dr Wieck,

393
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:07,138
从刚才所听到的,
in view of what you have just Iearned,

394
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:12,263
你是否还要说里萨法案是“纳粹的衡量方法”呢?
can you still say that sexual sterilisation was a "novel National Socialist measure"?

395
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:14,438
是，可以这么说
Yes, I can say it,

396
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:20,985
因为这在以前从来没有对政治犯适用过.
because it was never before used as a weapon against political opponents.

397
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,155
你是否有过这样的经历
Do you personally know of a case

398
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:26,819
处理这样的政治犯?
where someone was sterilised for political reasons?

399
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:30,121
 我知道有这样的事情.  这不是我的问题
 I know that such things were done.  That's not the question.

400
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:34,199
请回答 你是否知道
PIease answer the question. Do you know of a case?

401
00:36:34,337 --> 00:36:38,121
我不知道这样特种的案例
I don't know of any specific case or specific date.

402
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:42,207
那么你是否有相应的第一手资料!
I am asking if you have any first-hand, personal knowledge of such a case!

403
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:46,631
不，我没有这方面的知识
No, I have no such personal knowledge.

404
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:48,805
谢谢
Thank you.

405
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:59,858
Dr Wieck,

406
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:09,366
你知道有关对欧内斯特·姜宁的控诉吧?
you are aware of the charges in the indictment against Ernst Janning?

407
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:17,375
是
Yes, I am.

408
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:22,335
你认为他是否需要负责?
Can you honestly say he is responsible for them?

409
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:25,592
是
Yes, I can.

410
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:31,095
你认为自己没有责任?
Do you consider yourself free of responsibility?

411
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:34,850
是
Yes, I do.

412
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:43,144
你是否有在1934年的文职人员誓词中发誓?
Dr Wieck, did you ever swear to the Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1 934?

413
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:45,772
法官大人，我反对
Your Honour, I object.

414
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:50,950
证人无须回答， 他不是在受审
The witness doesn't have to answer that question. He's not on trial.

415
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,038
全德国都在受审， 当审理欧内斯特·姜宁的时候
AII Germany is on trial. This tribunal put it on trial when it indicted Ernst Janning.

416
00:37:56,169 --> 00:38:01,329
为了寻找责任， 需要扩大范围.
If responsibility is to be found, the widest Iatitude is to be permitted.

417
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:03,292
反对无效
Objection overruled.

418
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:08,882
你是否有在1934年的文职人员誓词中发誓?
Did you ever swear to the Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1 934?

419
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:14,884
 每个人都发誓了  我们对每个人不感兴趣.
 Everyone did.  We are not interested in everyone.

420
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:17,559
我们只在乎你做的.
We are interested in what you did.

421
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,064
可以读一下1933年3月第三帝国的誓词吗
Would you read the oath from the Reich Law Gazette, March 1 933.

422
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:27,573
"我发誓效忠人民的领袖：阿道夫·西特勒,
"I swear that I shall obey the Ieader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler,

423
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,867
忠诚于他， 忠诚于法律
that I shall be Ioyal to him, that I will observe the Iaws

424
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:35,823
我会尽职负责， 所以上帝保佑我们."
and that I will conscientiously fulfil my duties, so help me God."

425
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,998
每个人都发誓了
Everyone swore to it.

426
00:38:39,087 --> 00:38:41,625
这是强制的
It was mandatory.

427
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:45,374
是
Yes.

428
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:51,595
但你是个极有远见的人.
But you're such a perceptive man, Dr Wieck. You could see what was coming.

429
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:56,470
你应该知道纳粹党会给德国带来灾难.
You could see that National Socialism was Ieading Germany to disaster.

430
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,522
"是人都知道"
"It was clear to anyone who had eyes and ears."

431
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:05,529
你难道不知道那意味着什么
Didn't you realise what it would have meant

432
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:11,527
如果你，还有其他人民都拒绝发誓?
if you, and men Iike you, would have refused to swear to the oath?

433
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:17,865
那么西特勒就没有可能掌权!
It would have meant that Hitler could never have come to absolute power!

434
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:23,797
你为什么不这么做呢，威克博士？
Why didn't you? Dr Wieck, why didn't you?

435
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:28,383
你可以给我们一个解释吗?
Can you give us an explanation?

436
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:30,669
是否这样同你的退休金有关呢?
Has it something to do with your pension?

437
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:33,213
难道那比你的国家还重要?
Did it mean more to you than your country?

438
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:37,050
法官大人， 我反对这一系列的提问
Your Honour, I object to the entire Iine of questioning

439
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:39,512
应该从记录中删除.
and ask that it be stricken from the record.

440
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:42,648
检查团不就是为了追究责任吗.
Prosecuting counsel's job is to find responsibility.

441
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:44,898
法官大人，我反对
Your Honour, I made an objection.

442
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,732
公诉人不要追究责任?
Prosecution does not want to find responsibility?

443
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:52,490
这里必要谈效忠誓言!
There is responsibility for more here than swearing to a Ioyalty oath!

444
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:53,614
大有必要!
There is indeed!

445
00:39:53,745 --> 00:39:56,114
遵守秩序
 Order.  One thing even the German machine,

446
00:39:56,164 --> 00:39:59,663
with its monumental efficiency, has been unable to destroy!

447
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:02,165
 Order!  AII the victims!

448
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:05,664
全世界的受害者都知道...
More victims than the world has ever known. They will walk in here...

449
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,372
遵守秩序!
Order! Order!

450
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:12,887
法官席会听取双方意见， 但是我实在无法容忍.
This tribunal will admonish both counsels. It will not tolerate this again.

451
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:16,465
我们不是要你们发火， 我们在寻求正义
We're not here to Iisten to such outbursts, but to serve justice.

452
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:20,433
 法官大人，我反对.  反对无效
 Your Honour, I made an objection.  The objection is overruled.

453
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:24,223
证人离席
The witness is excused.

454
00:40:56,766 --> 00:41:00,016
 读过姜宁的书吗?  没有.
 Ever read any books by Janning?  No, I don't think so.

455
00:41:00,144 --> 00:41:03,015
 法律的意义.  怎么？有意思吗?
 The Meaning of the Law.  How is it? Interesting?

456
00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:06,232
姜宁的书都很有意思.
AII the books by Janning are interesting.

457
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,059
他反映的是一个时代的激情和希望
They're a picture of an era, its hopes, aspirations.

458
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:12,568
和我们没有太大区别
They weren't very different from ours.

459
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:16,281
听这段评价魏玛宪法的
Listen to this, on the signing of the Weimar constitution.

460
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:20,278
"现在我们可以展望没有战火的德国"
"Now we can Iook forward to a Germany without guns and bloodshed."

461
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:24,329
"我们可以不用死亡"
"A Germany of justice, where men can Iive instead of die."

462
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,572
"有自由和人性的德国"
"A Germany of purpose, of freedom, of humanity."

463
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,872
"A Germany that calls for the best in man."

464
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:32,130
能写出这样的书的人
How could a man who wrote words Iike these

465
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,008
他怎么可能会是杀人犯呢?
be part of sterilisations and murders? How could he be?

466
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:40,006
丹， 这里发生的很多事情都让人不明白的.
Dan, there are a Iot of things that happened here that nobody understands.

467
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:42,219
我知道
I know.

468
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:46,268
但是检查团还是要证明他们的控诉的
But the prosecution is going to have to prove every inch of its allegation

469
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:50,397
我也还是要对他做出宣判
against a man Iike Janning if I'm to pronounce sentence on him.

470
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:52,437
先生们，我要走了
Gentlemen, I'm on my way.

471
00:41:52,572 --> 00:41:54,611
 走吗，肯?  好
 Coming, Ken?  Right.

472
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:59,323
There's just this business on the curtailment of rights.

473
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:00,782
明天
Tomorrow.

474
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:04,448
丹， 我太太要办个聚会.
Dan, my wife is planning a get-together tomorrow at the Grand Hotel.

475
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:08,035
 她希望你能来.  好的，谢谢
 She wants you to come.  AII right. Thank you.

476
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:12,465
她还想给你介绍女伴呢
And she'd Iike to provide you with some kind of female companionship.

477
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:14,715
她觉得你可能太孤单了
She thought you might be Ionely here.

478
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:17,216
不，谢谢
No, thanks, Curtiss. Thanks very much.

479
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:19,672
你知道太太们总喜欢给人配对
You know how these wives Iove to play Cupid.

480
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:22,179
 我想最好还是单身  好的
 I think I'II keep it stag.  AII right.

481
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,227
 你怎么样，肯?  谢谢，我和太太已经够忙了
 How about you, Ken?  Thanks. My wife and I are busy.

482
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:28,309
 晚安  晚安，丹.
 Good night.  Good night, Dan.

483
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:50,911
海尔柏斯德夫人, 我能不能...
Mrs Halbestadt, could I...

484
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:54,626
Hello.

485
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:57,710
Hello.

486
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,930
法官大人，这是柏荷特夫人
Your Honour, this is Madame Bertholt.

487
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:03,133
这是海伍德法官
This is His Honour, Judge Haywood.

488
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:07,354
柏荷特夫人,这是她的房子
Madame Bertholt, this is her house.

489
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,434
她是来地下室拿些东西.
She came to get some of her belongings from the basement.

490
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:14,944
 我不知道她今晚会来.  这是我该做的.
 I didn't know she was coming tonight.  It's my responsibility, Mrs Halbestadt.

491
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:20,148
我在没有找到大房子以前把东西放这了.
I've stored some of my things here until I could get a room Iarge enough for them.

492
00:43:20,284 --> 00:43:22,954
 我希望你不要介意  不，一点也不
 I hope you don't mind.  No. Not at all.

493
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:26,372
要是你愿意， 你可以检查一下
You can examine what I have here if you Iike.

494
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:29,417

 Thank you, Mrs Halbestadt.  Let me help you.

晚安
Good night.

498
00:43:50,648 --> 00:43:55,809
很重吧，都是些无关紧要的书和图画， 但对我很重要.
It's heavy. It's full of books and pictures that mean nothing to anyone but me.

499
00:43:55,945 --> 00:43:58,270
 Mr Schmidt!  Your Honour.

500
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:03,657
 可以载柏荷特夫人回家吗?  是的，法官大人
 Would you drive Mrs Bertholt home?  Yes, Your Honour.

501
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:06,456

502
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:09,072
我最喜欢的地方还是花园
My favourite spot was always the garden.

503
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:12,293
提醒海尔柏斯德夫人照看好假山花园.
Remind Mr Halbestadt to take good care of the rock garden.

504
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,504
在夏天你会获得很多乐趣的.
You'II get a great deal of pleasure out of it in summer.

505
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:18,087
我坐在前面，谢谢
I'II sit in front, thank you.

506
00:44:20,178 --> 00:44:21,755

(whispered conversation)

509
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:47,242
坐下，坐下
Sit down, sit down.

510
00:44:49,332 --> 00:44:52,915
海尔柏斯德夫人, 你为柏斯德夫人工作不是吗?
Mrs Halbestadt, you worked for Mrs Bertholt, didn't you?

511
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:57,414
 是的，法官大人  她住在这多久了?
 Yes, Your Honour.  How Iong did she Iive here?

512
00:44:58,132 --> 00:44:59,876
柏斯德夫人?
Madame Bertholt?

513
00:45:00,009 --> 00:45:04,755
噢，她们世代都住在这里.
Oh, Madame Bertholt and her family have Iived here for many generations.

514
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:08,050

Thank you.

515
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:12,268
法官大人， 你来有什么事情?
Your Honour, you came in here for something?

516
00:45:12,397 --> 00:45:13,725
是
Oh! Oh, yeah.

517
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,015
我想做一份三明治.
I'm just going to make myself a sandwich.

518
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,985
我们来做吧， 做任何你想要的.
We will make it. We will make you anything you want.

519
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:21,899
不，小事 我总是回家后自己动手做.
No, it's nothing. I always did it for myself back home.

520
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:26,907
你想要什么口味的? 我有火腿、奶酪等.
What would you Iike? I have some ham and cheese and Iiverwurst.

521
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:29,076

522
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:32,788
你真是太好了
That's very kind of you.

523
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:45,251
海尔柏斯德先生， 生活在纳粹之下是怎么样种感觉呢?
Mr Halbestadt, what was it Iike, Iiving under National Socialism?

 What was it Iike?  Yes. I mean, uh... day-to-day?

526
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:58,566
我相信你们是好人
You're good people. I believe that.

527
00:45:59,694 --> 00:46:02,564
那么生活在西特勒统治下是什么感觉呢?
What was it Iike for you, Iiving under Hitler?

528
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:06,611
我和我丈夫都不是政治分子.
We were not political. Mr Halbestadt and I are not political.

529
00:46:06,743 --> 00:46:09,031
 Ein Glas fur die Milch, bitte.  Ja.

530
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:15,533
不，但你们一定清楚当时发生了什么事情.
No, but you must have been aware of some of the events that were going on.

531
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:19,869
很多事情都在发生

535
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:33,392
我们从来没有参加集会
We never attended meetings. Never.

536
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:37,515
我不是要审判你们 我只是...
I'm not trying to put you on trial. I'm just, uh...

537
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:40,318
我只是好奇，想知道而已.

For instance, there was a place called Dachau not too many miles from here.

542
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:59,535
你们知道那里发生了什么吗?
Did you ever know what was going on there?

543
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:03,253
我们什么都不知道.
We knew nothing about it. Nothing about it.

544
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:10,055
你怎么可以问我们是否知道呢?

545
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:13,679
对不起

我相信也是如此

00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,539
西特勒... 西特勒也做了一些好事.

很少德国人知道.

00:56:33,745 --> 00:56:36,318
能否请你读最后一段?
(Lawson) Would you read the Iast paragraph?

669
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:47,674
"因此建议他在两周内
"It is therefore requested he present himself within two weeks

670
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,383
到以下指定医院接受治疗"
to one of the hospitals mentioned below."

671
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:59,601
"如果他不自愿前往,
"If he does not betake himself voluntarily,

672
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:03,389
他将被强制执行."
he will be taken by force."

673
00:57:07,612 --> 00:57:10,317
现在请念出底下的签名.
Now please read the signature at the bottom.

674
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:16,577
"主审法官霍夫斯特."
"Presiding Justice Hofstetter."

675
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,833
再读下面的签名?
Would you read what is written below the signature?

676
00:57:24,712 --> 00:57:26,954
 下面?  下面.

"By authority of Ernst Janning,

678

Minister of Justice."

679
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:42,100
法官大人,
Your Honour,

680
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,141
被告可以看皮特斯的文件资料吗?
may the defence see the file of Mr Petersen?

681
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:52,652
你收到裁决书后如何?
What did you do after you received the Ietter, Mr Petersen?

682
00:57:52,782 --> 00:57:57,574
我逃跑了， 躲在一个农场朋友的家里.
I ran away. I stayed at the farm of a friend I have.

683
00:57:58,454 --> 00:58:01,159
你回来了吗?
And did you return?

684
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,366
 我怎么?  你回去了吗?
 Did I what?  Did you return?

685
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,371
是
Yes.

686
00:58:05,503 --> 00:58:07,543
又发生了什么?
And what happened then?

687
00:58:08,548 --> 00:58:12,592
警察来了.
The police came. The police came.

688
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:18,638
 他们把你带去哪里?  医院
 Where did they take you?  (quietly) To the hospital.

689
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,595
皮特斯先生， 能否请你发言大声点.
Mr Petersen. Excuse me, I wonder if you could speak a Iittle Iouder, please.

690
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:28,021
去医院
To the hospital.

691
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:33,145
 医院里发生了什么?  他们把我关在那.
 What happened at the hospital?  They kept me there.

692
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:36,650
护士...
The nurse who was...

693
00:58:38,453 --> 00:58:40,611
最后还是进来了.
Well, she came in anyway.

694
00:58:40,747 --> 00:58:43,866
她为我准备手术.
She was to prepare me for the operation.

695
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,626
她说整件事情都很可怕.
And she said she thought the whole thing was terrible.

696
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:56,007
然后医生就进来了， 准备...
And then the doctor came in, who was supposed to do the...

697
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:01,680
他说也觉得很恶心
and he said he thought it was awful.

698
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:06,894
你是否劣等种族?
Were you in fact sterilised?

699
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:18,154
谢谢，皮特斯先生.
(Lawson) Thank you very much, Mr Petersen.

700
00:59:19,577 --> 00:59:20,858
问毕
That's all.

701
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:25,204
罗尔福发言.
Herr Rolfe.

702
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:37,091
Mr Petersen,

703
00:59:38,763 --> 00:59:42,926
如果你愿意， 你现在可以取下耳机.
you may take your earphones off now, if you want to.

704
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:54,397
你说你是面包师贝克的助手?
Mr Petersen, you say you work as a baker's helper? Is that correct?

705
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,568
是，没错
Yes, that is right.

706
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,607
你还有其他什么职业?
What other occupations have you held?

707
01:00:00,743 --> 01:00:03,281
我为父亲工作
I have worked for my father.

708
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:08,825
 你父亲职业?  铁路职工.
 What did your father do?  He was a railroad worker.

709
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,961
是，他具体工作是什么?
Yes, but what did he do?

710
01:00:12,088 --> 01:00:21,045
他负责十字路口栅栏的升降.
He would raise and Iower the barrier at the crossing for traffic.

711
01:00:24,642 --> 01:00:27,643
你也提到了你的兄弟
And you spoke about your brothers.

712
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,685
 你有多少个兄弟?  五个
 How many brothers do you have?  Five.

713
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:34,521
 姐妹呢?  四个
 And sisters?  Four.

714
01:00:34,652 --> 01:00:37,736
 就是说十口之家了? -是
 Then you are a family of ten?  Yes.

715
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,992
你兄弟的职业?
What occupations do your brothers have?

716
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,491
劳工
Labourers.

717
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,661
都是劳工?
AII Iabourers?

718
01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:49,955
我知道了
I see.

719
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:55,045
你说斯图加特法院问了你两个问题,
Mr Petersen, you said the court at Stuttgart asked you two questions,

720
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:57,296
西特勒的生日.
the birth dates of Hitler and Dr Goebbels.

721
01:00:57,425 --> 01:01:00,758
 对吗?  没错
 Is that correct?  Yes. Correct.

722
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:03,010
他们还问你什么?
What else did they ask you?

723
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:05,345
恩
Uh...

724
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:08,144
没有了.
Nothing else.

725
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:10,309
你确定?
Are you sure?

726
01:01:10,438 --> 01:01:13,724
你确定没有问到你学业的问题?
Are you sure there were no questions about your schooling?

727
01:01:13,858 --> 01:01:15,898
反对!
(Lawson) Objection!

728
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:19,941
证人早已回答问题了.
The witness has already answered that question.

729
01:01:22,784 --> 01:01:24,823
反对有效
Objection sustained.

730
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:33,825
我可以问你吗，皮特斯...
May I ask you, Mr Petersen...

731
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,630
我可以问你...
may I ask you...

732
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:45,003
你读了几年书?
how Iong did you attend school?

733
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:49,433
 六年  六年，为什么不久些?
 Six years.  Six years. Why not Ionger?

734
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:52,805
我必须工作
I had to go to work.

735
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:58,099
你觉得自己在学校是否很聪明?
Would you consider yourself a very bright fellow at school?

736
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:01,569
学校? 说起来...
School? It was...

737
01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:05,232
这已经是很久远的事了， 我...
It was a Iong while ago. I don't...

738
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:08,488
或许是因为你跟不上其他孩子
Perhaps you were not able to keep up with the others

739
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:10,661
所以你辍学了?
and that's why you did not continue?

740
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,913
反对，法官大人
Objection, Your Honour.

741
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:16,494
证人的学业同发生在他身上的事情无关
The witness' school record has no bearing on what happened to him.

742
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:22,252
健康法院的职责就是检场智力.
It was the task of the health court to sterilise the mentally incompetent.

743
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:27,344
反对无效.
Objection overruled.

744
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:39,600
你是否能够跟上其他人的学习进度?
Were you able or were you not able to keep up with the others?

745
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:49,987
我不得不提到学校有关皮特斯学习效率的报告.
I would Iike to refer to the efficiency report from the school about Mr Petersen.

746
01:02:50,121 --> 01:02:56,206
他无法进步， 只好分配到了后进班.
He failed to be promoted and was placed in a class of backward children.

747
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:03,288
你说你父母死于自然.
You say your parents died of natural causes.

748
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:04,706
是
Yes.

749
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:08,343
你能否仔细描述你母亲死于什么疾病?
Would you describe in detail the illness your mother died of?

750
01:03:08,473 --> 01:03:10,512
她死于心脏病
She died of her heart.

751
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:15,936
在她临时的阶段...
In the Iast stages of her illness, did your mother show any...

752
01:03:16,064 --> 01:03:18,981
她是否精神方面有异常?
mental peculiarities?

753
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:22,358
精神... 不，不
Mental... No. No.

754
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:26,230
从斯图加特来的报告显示,
In the decision that came from Stuttgart,

755
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:30,031
你母亲承袭了遗传的低能症.
it is stated that your mother suffered from hereditary feeble-mindedness.

756
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:32,699
这不是……不是真的.
That is not... That is not true.

757
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:34,740
不是真的，不是
Not true, not true.

758
01:03:36,376 --> 01:03:38,997
你是否可以澄清
Can you give us some clarification as to how

759
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:43,078
为什么斯图加特法院会做出那样的决定?
the Hereditary Health Court in Stuttgart arrived at that decision?

760
01:03:43,216 --> 01:03:48,091
这只是他们自己捏造的理由， 将我送上了手术台.
It was just something they said to put me on the operating table.

761
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:50,890
 只是他们捏造的?  是!
 It was just something they said?  Yes!

762
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:58,391
在健康法院的检查中
Mr Petersen, there was a simple test that the Health Court used to ask

763
01:03:58,523 --> 01:04:01,477
有一个常用的检查智力发育完整与否的测验
in all cases of mental incompetence.

764
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:04,729
既然你说他们没有问,
Since you say they did not ask you then,

765
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:07,484
或许现在你可以回答了?
perhaps you can answer it for us now?

766
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:11,280
从一组词中 "hare", "hunter", "field".
Form a sentence out of the words "hare", "hunter", "field".

767
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:13,569
法官大人，反对
Your Honour! Objection!

768
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,666
Mr Petersen,

769
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:26,881
斯图加特法院当时是否有这样的做法?
was the court in Stuttgart constituted Iike this one?

770
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:30,584
我不明白...
I don't understand what...

771
01:04:30,722 --> 01:04:33,260
当时有听众吗?
Was there an audience?

772
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:35,801
听众? 是的
An audience? Yes, yes.

773
01:04:36,728 --> 01:04:38,767
谢谢
Thank you.

774
01:04:41,274 --> 01:04:43,313
反对无效
Objection overruled.

775
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:50,823
Hare, hunter, field, 皮特斯先生.
Hare, hunter, field, Mr Petersen.

776
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:55,659
慢慢来.
Take your time.

777
01:04:57,582 --> 01:04:59,907
Hare, hunter, field. 恩...
Hare, hunter, field. Uh...

778
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,161
Hare,
Hare,

779
01:05:05,298 --> 01:05:07,337
hunter...
hunter...

780
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:12,429
他们早已...
They had already made up...

781
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:16,592
当我进入法庭时， 他们早已拿定主意.
When I walked into the court, they had made up their minds.

782
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:19,810
他们早已拿定主意!
They had made up their minds!

783
01:05:19,937 --> 01:05:23,353
他们像对待囚犯一样把我送到医院.
They put me in the hospital, Iike a criminal.

784
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:28,109
我什么都不好说. 我...
I could not say anything, I could not do anything. I...

785
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:31,737
我只好在那撒谎.
I had to Iie there.

786
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:37,037
我... 我的母亲...
My... my mother...

787
01:05:38,164 --> 01:05:40,204
你说她什么.
what you say about her.

788
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:44,117
她是个女人, 一个勤劳工作的女仆
She was a woman, a servant woman, who worked hard.

789
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:46,293
她是个努力工作的人.
She was a hardworking woman.

790
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:50,206
你说的一切，很不公平.
And it is not fair  not fair  what you say.

791
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,180
我有
I have it here.

792
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:03,480
我给你们看她的照片
I want to show you. I have here her picture.

793
01:06:04,315 --> 01:06:06,984
我想让你们看看
I would Iike you Iooked at it.

794
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:21,034
我想让你们来评判
I would Iike you to judge.

795
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:26,628
我想要你告诉我
I want that you tell me,

796
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:30,337
她是低能的吗?
was she feeble-minded?

797
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:33,382
我的母亲!
My mother!

798
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:36,718
她是低能的吗?
Was she feeble-minded?

799
01:06:39,308 --> 01:06:41,052
她是吗?
Was she?

800
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:55,103
我觉得我有必要向法庭指出
I feel it is my duty to point out to the tribunal

801
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:58,361
证人现在情绪失控.
that the witness is not in control of his mental processes.

802
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,655
我知道我没有
I know I'm not.

803
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,829
从那天开始,
Since that day,

804
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:08,785
我就变成原来的一半.
I've been half I've ever been.

805
01:07:16,471 --> 01:07:20,385
法庭并不知道你当时如何.
The tribunal does not know how you were before.

806
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:25,178
这永远也不可能知道， 现在只有你的证词.
It can never know. It has only your word.

807
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:49,291
现在休庭.
Court is adjourned.

808
01:07:51,256 --> 01:07:53,295
(# dance band)

809
01:08:01,265 --> 01:08:03,935
检查团真是让人头疼 -
That's one problem we have with the prosecution -

810
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,180
里面总是有像劳森这样的激进分子.
it's filled with young radicals Iike Lawson.

811
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,685
劳森是这样的吗? 激进分子?
Is that what Lawson is? A young radical?

812
01:08:09,816 --> 01:08:12,852
当然，他是FDR的培养人之一.
Well, he was a personal protege of FDR.

813
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:16,105
FDR也有些非激进的吧，不是吗?
FDR had a few friends who weren't radicals, didn't he?

814
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:18,694
说一个.
Name one.

815
01:08:18,825 --> 01:08:21,576
 温德尔·威尔忌.  威尔忌.
 Wendell Wilkie.  Wilkie.

816
01:08:21,703 --> 01:08:24,739
他是你心中理想的保守派?
Is he your idea of a conservative?

817
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:28,952
事实上，丹， 我真的不知道你的立场如何?
As a matter of fact, Dan, I've been wondering how you stand?

818
01:08:29,085 --> 01:08:33,498
那我现在就说明， 我是忠实的共和党派
I'II clarify that for you, Curtiss. I'm a rock-ribbed Republican

819
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:36,965
觉得富兰克林·罗斯福是个伟人.
who thought that Franklin Roosevelt was a great man.

820
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:39,584
哦，这样
Oh. One of those.

821
01:08:42,473 --> 01:08:44,383
马克斯!
Max!

822
01:08:44,517 --> 01:08:47,269
 你认识他吗?  不认识
 Max Perkins. Do you know him?  I don't think so.

823
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:49,720
他是联合出版社的
He's with the United Press.

824
01:08:53,317 --> 01:08:57,446
 马克斯，你在这干吗?  我以为你又要起哄了.
 Max, what are you doing here?  I thought you might kick up a row.

825
01:08:57,572 --> 01:08:59,814
我可没有喝那么多
I haven't had that much to drink.

826
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:02,238
 哦，对不起，这是艾夫斯法官  你好
 Oh, I'm sorry. This is Judge Ives.  Hello.

827
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,112
 艾夫斯夫人.  你好?
 Mrs Ives.  How do you do?

828
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:06,570
 你好?  海伍德法官，柏斯德夫人.
 How do you do?  Judge Haywood, Mrs Bertholt.

829
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:09,031
 我们见过面了.  是
 We have met.  Yes, we have.

830
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:13,116
 为什么不一起来喝一杯呢?  非常乐意.
 Won't you join us for a drink?  We would Iike to very much.

831
01:09:13,254 --> 01:09:15,959
 马克斯，你坐这好了?  谢谢
 Max, will you sit here?  Thank you.

832
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:20,420
对了，马克斯， 我特别喜欢你写的有关柏斯德夫人的文章.
Incidentally, Max, I admired your article on Mrs Bertholt very much.

833
01:09:20,553 --> 01:09:24,467
那是直接报道， 柏斯德为她丈夫的辩护很精彩.
It was straight reporting. Her defence of her husband was quite eloquent.

834
01:09:24,599 --> 01:09:26,971
你是否要对这些审判做报道?
Are you going to do a story on these trials?

835
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:29,593
说实话吧，法官.
I'II tell you something frankly, Judge.

836
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:33,394
我现在不能报道纽伦堡的案子.
At the moment I couldn't give a story away on the Nuremberg trials.

837
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:37,569
 什么意思?  美国报社不感兴趣.
 What do you mean, Mr Perkins?  The American public isn't interested.

838
01:09:37,695 --> 01:09:40,862
战争才两年时间.
The war's only been over two years, Mr Perkins.

839
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,650
对
That's right.

840
01:09:42,784 --> 01:09:45,820
 可以点酒了吗?  看看我们还需要什么.
 May I take your order?  Yes. See what the Iadies will have.

841
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:49,287
 丹，再来点啤酒怎么样?  不，啤酒我喝够了.
 How about some more beer, Dan?  No, I think I've had my fill of beer.

842
01:09:49,415 --> 01:09:51,491
如果可以，我想试试别的.
I'd Iike to try something else, if I may.

843
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:55,955
为什么不尝尝苏格拉冰呢? 这是当地的酒
Why don't you try some Sonnenberg or Schwalbenwinkel? It's the Iocal wine.

844
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:58,924
 苏格拉冰?  苏格拉冰.
 Sonnenberg or...?  Schwalbenwinkel.

845
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:03,130
是的，我想要点苏格拉冰.
Yes, I think I'd Iike that. Some Schwalbenwinkel.

846
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:05,718
 你要吗?  是的，谢谢
 Will you have some?  Yes, thank you.

847
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:08,470
 我们还是要啤酒吗，马克斯?  好
 Shall we stay with the beer, Max?  Fine.

848
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:10,392
谢谢
Thank you.

849
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,805
 那晚你顺利回去了吧?  是的，谢谢
 You got home all right the other night?  Yes, thank you.

850
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,724
我真不知道没有车我该怎么办.
I don't know what I would have done without the car.

851
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,565
柏斯德夫人， 你的英语讲的真好.
You speak English very well, Mrs Bertholt.

852
01:10:20,697 --> 01:10:21,942
谢谢
Thank you.

853
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:25,773
我和丈夫在美国待了两年
My husband and I spent two years in America.

854
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:32,165
我希望你有空可以参观一下纽伦堡.
I hope you've had a chance to see something of Nuremberg.

855
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:37,915
我想那可能会影响法官的公正.
I'm afraid mainly the road between my house and the Palace of Justice.

856
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:42,460
或许有些地方， 从历史学的角度来看对案件有帮助.
And then some places that have to do with the case, historical aspects.

857
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:47,172
从纳粹角度， 你应该从另一个角度看纽伦堡.
The Nazi aspects. You should see some of the other parts of Nuremberg.

858
01:10:47,306 --> 01:10:50,592
在旧城区有很多好看的,
There are many beautiful things to see in the old part of town,

859
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:52,766
比如重建的博物馆.
museums we're trying to rebuild.

860
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:57,142
还有在老歌剧院的钢琴音乐会.
And there's a concert, a piano concert, next week at the old opera house.

861
01:10:57,275 --> 01:11:01,522
亚瑟·里斯. 他早前为西特勒演出
Arthur Reiss. He was a refugee from Hitler in the early days.

862
01:11:01,654 --> 01:11:05,568
我们劝服他回来 我想今晚会很精彩.
We've persuaded him to come back. It ought to be quite an evening.

863
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,947
 你会来吗?  是，我会
 Would you Iike to come?  Yes, I would.

864
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,159
我会让票房给你留张票的， 我是在委员会的.
I'II have them Ieave a ticket for you at the box office. I'm on the committee.

865
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:16,997
 非常感谢，柏斯德夫人.  没什么
 Thank you very much, Mrs Bertholt.  It's nothing.

866
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:20,995
我同美国有个协议 马克斯可以告诉你.
I have a mission with the Americans, as Mr Perkins can tell you.

867
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:23,457
哦，什么?
Oh? What is that?

868
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:27,637
使你相信我们并不都是怪物.
To convince you that we're not all monsters.

869
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:34,509
晚上好, 上校.
 Good evening, Colonel.  Colonel, Major Radnitz.

870
01:11:34,645 --> 01:11:37,101
晚上好, 柏斯德夫人.
Good evening, Mrs Bertholt.

871
01:11:40,026 --> 01:11:42,351
 我希望你原谅.  可你才来.
 I hope you'II excuse me.  You've just come.

872
01:11:42,487 --> 01:11:44,526
不，我必须走了 请见谅.
No, I must go. PIease excuse me.

873
01:11:44,655 --> 01:11:46,695
真是非常愉快的碰面.
It was awfully nice meeting you.

874
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:49,861
我会在票房给你留票的.
There will be a concert ticket for you at the box office.

875
01:11:49,994 --> 01:11:51,025
谢谢
Thank you.

876
01:11:51,162 --> 01:11:52,870
 晚安  晚安
 Good night.  Good night.

877
01:11:52,997 --> 01:11:55,204
 晚安 -晚安，柏斯德夫人.
 Good night.  Good night, Mrs Bertholt.

878
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,627
Huh.

879
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:05,333
柏斯德夫人对我恨之入骨啊.
Mrs Bertholt doesn't hold a burning passion for me.

880
01:12:06,386 --> 01:12:09,055
我控诉了她丈夫
I prosecuted her husband.

881
01:12:10,056 --> 01:12:13,389
今天看来
Many people think a death sentence would not have been passed

882
01:12:13,518 --> 01:12:15,475
很多人觉得柏斯德将军审判是不会通过死刑的
against General Bertholt today.

883
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:18,141
我知道.
I'm sure they do.

884
01:12:18,272 --> 01:12:20,479
我也知道今天在纽伦堡
I'm sure there are people who think

885
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:23,811
他们觉得在席的被告都会无罪
all the prisoners in Nuremberg should be free today.

886
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:26,184
所有人!
AII of them! Let's...

887
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:28,933
对不起
Excuse me.

888
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:31,106
我...
I've had, uh...

889
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:36,656
我想我喝太多了， 所以失礼了.
I've had one or two too many, as might be painfully obvious to you gentlemen.

890
01:12:36,782 --> 01:12:41,160
今天下午的展览会让我迟到了.
The spectacle this afternoon with Mr Petersen put me off my feed. I'm sorry.

891
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:45,450
酒来了.
Three beers and Schwalbenwinkel, please.

892
01:12:49,337 --> 01:12:51,910
Prosit. Prosit.

893
01:12:52,048 --> 01:12:55,713
 Schwalbenwinkel.  Schwalbenwinkel.

894
01:12:55,843 --> 01:13:00,256
啤酒不错， 他们的手艺真的不错.
Yes, it's good beer. They make it good in this country.

895
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:02,181
你知道...
You know...

896
01:13:02,308 --> 01:13:06,602
你知道美国人.
You know, there's one thing about Americans.

897
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:09,185
我们并不是占领者.
We're not cut out to be occupiers.

898
01:13:09,315 --> 01:13:12,269
我们对这里还很不熟悉.
We're new at it and we're not very good at it.

899
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:15,486
我们来到这里， 看到了什么呢?
We come over here, and what do we see?

900
01:13:16,447 --> 01:13:18,819
我们见到了这个美丽的国家.
We see this beautiful country.

901
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:21,986
非常美丽
It is beautiful. It's very beautiful.

902
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:25,156
我们看到了几百年前的文化.
We see the culture that goes back for hundreds of years.

903
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:28,076
我们见到了亲善的魅力
We see its gemutlich charm,

904
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:32,420
再如柏斯德夫人这样的美人.
and the charm of people Iike, uh... Mrs Bertholt.

905
01:13:33,214 --> 01:13:35,919
我们有一定的自卑情绪.
We got a built-in inferiority complex.

906
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,837
我们很善忘和宽恕.
We forgive and forget easy.

907
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:45,055
我们给予另一个值得怀疑的人利益. 这是美国作风
We give the other guy the benefit of the doubt  that's the American way.

908
01:13:45,184 --> 01:13:50,226
我们击败了战争机器（德国）
We beat the greatest war machine since AIexander the Great

909
01:13:50,356 --> 01:13:53,273
现在已经控制了它.
and now the boy scouts take over.

910
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:58,019
上校，你的问题是， 你要控诉整个国家.
The trouble with you, Colonel, is you'd Iike to indict the whole country.

911
01:13:58,155 --> 01:14:00,646
那或许可以让你情绪上得到满足,
That might be emotionally satisfying to you,

912
01:14:00,783 --> 01:14:04,152
但这不实际， 也不公平.
but it wouldn't be exactly practical, and hardly fair.

913
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:07,577
几乎不公平?
Hardly fair?

914
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:12,409
"Hare"（野兔）,
"Hare",

915
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:14,917
"hunter"（猎人）,
"hunter",

916
01:14:15,047 --> 01:14:17,087
"field"（原野）.
"field".

917
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,506
好的，让我们公平点.
That's right, Iet's be fair.

918
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,755
野兔在原野上被猎人捕获.
The hare was shot by the hunter in the field.

919
01:14:24,891 --> 01:14:27,216
真的很简单.
It's really quite simple.

920
01:14:28,728 --> 01:14:30,305
恩...
Uh...

921
01:14:30,438 --> 01:14:34,020
上校，我想我们该走了.
Colonel, I think we ought to be going.

922
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,273
是的， 我们不该讨论这个.
Yes. We shouldn't be discussing this.

923
01:14:36,402 --> 01:14:40,234
不，法官 我们是公平的美国人
Oh, no, Judge(!) We're fair Americans, and true blue.

924
01:14:40,364 --> 01:14:42,736
我们不会违反秩序的.
We mustn't do anything that's out of order.

925
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:46,366
我们不能做违反秩序的事情.
We can't do anything that's out of order.

926
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:53,786
难道你不知道在德国没有纳粹吗，法官?
There are no Nazis in Germany. Didn't you know that, Judge?

927
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,541
爱斯基摩人侵略了德国.
The Eskimos invaded Germany and took over.

928
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:59,590
所以发生了这么多可怕的事情.
That's how all those terrible things happened.

929
01:14:59,717 --> 01:15:04,842
这不是德国人的错， 都是该死的爱斯基摩人的错!
It wasn't the fault of the Germans, it was the fault of those damn Eskimos!

930
01:15:06,682 --> 01:15:09,968
对不起，对不起
Excuse me. Excuse me.

931
01:15:10,102 --> 01:15:13,353
 晚安, 上校.  晚安
 Good night, Colonel.  Good night.

932
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:25,781
(music stops)

933
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:30,035
大家听我说? 抱歉打扰大家跳舞.
Can I have your attention? Sorry to interrupt your dancing.

934
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:33,865
以下官员马上向原单位报告.
The following officers are requested to report to their units.

935
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:37,785
麦卡犀少校, 卡腾少校,
Major McCarthy, Major Citron, Major Cantor,

936
01:15:38,005 --> 01:15:40,496
柏尔斯少尉, 康氖尔少尉,

Herr Janning, did you hear what is in the paper?

正同西特勒所说一样: "西方和东方生存的冲突（两大阵营）."
Exactly what Hitler said: "The clash for survival between east and west."

954
01:16:45,072 --> 01:16:47,279
他早就预料了!
Ah, he knew. He knew!

955

他们会明白我们为什么一直这么做.
They'II see that we knew exactly what we were doing all the time.

956

他们不能再把我们做囚犯， 而要求我们来帮助.
They cannot call us criminals and at the same time ask us to help them.

957
01:16:55,666 --> 01:17:00,827

In the old times it would have made your day

960

if I deigned to say "Good morning" to you.

961

现在我们都身处牢狱
Now that we are here in this place together,

962
01:17:11,349 --> 01:17:14,552
你也不用多说什么了.
you feel obliged to tell me what to do with my Iife.

963

欧内·姜宁， 你必须同我们同一阵线.
Herr Janning, you must stand with us.

德国人不好内讧的， 我们有共同的目标
It is not good for Germans to turn on one another. We have a common ground now.

965
01:17:22,652 --> 01:17:24,609

Listen to me, Herr Hahn.

我同你们以及你们的政党都没有关系.
I have nothing in common with you and the party hacks.

970
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:39,498
你和我们有共同点， 我们都是在同一政体下.
You have something in common  you were part of the same regime.

971
01:17:39,627 --> 01:17:42,118
你像我们一样.
You stood by that regime, Iike the rest of us.

972
01:17:42,255 --> 01:17:45,421
还有一点:
And there is something else you have in common:

973
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,589
你也是德国人

No, it isn't really. I'm a district court judge.

 Are you retired?  Forcibly, by the electorate.

1020

在美国法官是选举的吗?

 是的，有些州是这样的  我不知道
 Yes, in some states.  I didn't know that.

1022
01:22:24,871 --> 01:22:28,322
这是司法体系的优点也是缺点.
It's either a virtue or a defect of our judiciary system.

1023

我想去年我被淘汰也是好事.
I thought it was one of the virtues until Iast year, when I was defeated.

我想还是选举制度的问题， 不是你的错.
I'm sure it was the fault of the electorate, not yours.

1025
01:22:36,215 --> 01:22:41,043
There seems to be some difference of opinion about that.

生活不容易吧?
Things haven't been very easy for you, have they?

1031

我不习惯太舒适.
I'm not used to them being easy.

我可没那么脆弱
I'm not fragile, Judge Haywood.

我是军人的女儿
I'm a daughter of the military.

 你知道这意味着什么?  不，我不知道
 You know what that means, don't you?  No, I'm afraid I don't.

1035
01:23:25,556 --> 01:23:28,427
这说明我是受纪律教育的
It means I was taught discipline.

1036
01:23:29,268 --> 01:23:31,427
一种很特别的纪律
A very special kind of discipline.

1037
01:23:31,562 --> 01:23:36,141
比如，在小时候 夏天我们要走很远到乡村.
For instance, as a child we would go for Iong rides into the country in the summer.

1038
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:40,569
但是我从来不允许在路上像其他孩子一样喝柠檬水.
But I was never allowed to run to the Iemonade stand with the others.

1039
01:23:40,696 --> 01:23:44,112
我被教育要："控制干渴."
I was told "Control your thirst."

1040
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:47,199
"控制饥饿."
"Control hunger."

1041

"控制感情."
"Control emotion."

1042
01:23:50,248 --> 01:23:52,287
这对我帮助很大
It has served me well.

1043
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:57,166
那你的丈夫呢？ 他也如此吗?
And your husband? Was he of that heritage, too?

1044
01:23:57,296 --> 01:24:01,294
我的丈夫是军人， 他只知道一件事-
My husband was a soldier. He was brought up to do one thing -

1045
01:24:01,425 --> 01:24:04,592
战斗，打好战
to fight in the battle and fight well.

1046
01:24:07,098 --> 01:24:09,885
 咖啡还好吗?  很好，谢谢
 Is the coffee all right?  Fine, thank you.

1047
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:12,508
我加了伊砂特, 加重味道的.
It's ersatz, but I always try to make it strong.

1048
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:14,934
很好
It's fine.

1049
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,900
我很好奇
I'm curious.

1050
01:24:23,239 --> 01:24:26,193
你是怎么看欧内斯特·姜宁的?
What do you think of Ernst Janning?

1051
01:24:27,368 --> 01:24:33,038
柏斯德夫人， 我不好在庭外私自评论的.
Mrs Bertholt, I'm not at Iiberty to discuss the case outside of the courtroom.

1052
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:35,580
噢，当然
Oh, yes. Of course.

1053
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:45,000
我对他的事情知道一点 我们一同参加过音乐会.
I knew Ernst Janning a Iittle. We used to attend the same concerts.

1054
01:24:45,136 --> 01:24:48,719
There was a reception given for Wagner's daughter-in-Iaw.

1055
01:24:48,848 --> 01:24:50,805
当时西特勒也在
Hitler was there.

1056
01:24:50,933 --> 01:24:54,100
欧内斯特·姜宁和他妻子一起
Ernst Janning was there with his wife.

1057
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:56,351
她很漂亮
She was very beautiful.

1058
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,806
小巧可爱
Very small, very delicate.

1059
01:24:58,941 --> 01:25:01,064
她现在死了
She's dead now.

1060
01:25:01,736 --> 01:25:04,024
西特勒为她着迷了.
Hitler was quite taken with her.

1061
01:25:04,155 --> 01:25:06,824
他在接待会上接见她.
He made advances towards her during the reception.

1062
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:10,650
他总是感情冲动.
He used to do things Iike that in a burst of emotion.

1063
01:25:10,786 --> 01:25:14,155
我不会忘记欧内斯特·姜宁制止他的一幕.
I will never forget the way Ernst Janning cut him down.

1064
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:17,579
我想没有人那么对待过他.
I don't think anybody did it to him quite that way.

1065
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:24,673
他说 "长官, 我对你的失礼并不在意."
He said "Chancellor, I do not object so much that you are so ill-mannered."

1066
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,004
"我不介意你的失礼."
"I do not object to that so much."

1067
01:25:28,137 --> 01:25:30,842
"我只介意你竟是如此平庸."
"I object that you are such a bourgeois."

1068
01:25:32,183 --> 01:25:36,596
西特勒都气白了脸, 生气的离开了
Hitler whitened, stared at Janning and walked out.

1069
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:42,890
咖啡还好吗?
Is the coffee really all right?

1070
01:25:43,027 --> 01:25:45,067
很好，谢谢
Fine, thank you.

1071
01:25:47,323 --> 01:25:52,234
像姜宁、我丈夫还有我这样的人们， 都憎恨西特勒.
Men Iike Janning, my husband and I, we hated Hitler.

1072
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:56,450
我想要你知道 他恨我们.
I want you to know that. And he hated us.

1073
01:25:56,582 --> 01:25:59,998
他恨我的丈夫， 因为他是真的英雄,
He hated my husband because he was a real war hero,

1074
01:26:00,127 --> 01:26:02,915
然后他不能容忍.
and the Iittle corporal couldn't tolerate that.

1075
01:26:03,047 --> 01:26:09,251
他（西特勒）恨他娶到了贵族的女儿.
And he hated him because he married into nobility, which was my family.

1076
01:26:09,387 --> 01:26:13,598
西特勒害怕高贵， 但他憎恨.
Hitler was in awe of the nobility, but he hated it.

1077
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,384
这就是所发生的， 很有讽刺意义.
That's why it's so ironic, what happened.

1078
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:24,940
你知道我丈夫怎么样了?
You know what happened to my husband?

1079
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:26,528
是
Yes.

1080
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:30,699
他们指控他的罪名?
What did he know of the crimes they cited him for?

1081
01:26:30,825 --> 01:26:34,490
他同其他的战犯一起被审判
He was placed on trial with the other military Ieaders.

1082
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:40,326
他是战争的牺牲品.
He was part of the revenge the victors always take on the vanquished.

1083
01:26:40,459 --> 01:26:42,582
这是政治谋杀.
It was political murder.

1084
01:26:43,588 --> 01:26:46,791
你可以明白的，不是吗?
You can see that, can't you?

1085
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:50,258
柏斯德夫人, 我不明白.
Mrs Bertholt, I don't know what I see.

1086
01:26:51,721 --> 01:26:56,596
我或许真的不该同你谈这个.
I probably shouldn't be here talking with you about this at all.

1087
01:26:56,726 --> 01:27:00,640
我明白， 我真的想明白.
I want to understand. I do want to understand.

1088
01:27:01,647 --> 01:27:03,687
我不得不
I have to.

1089
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:19,622
你还要咖啡吗?
Would you Iike some more coffee?

1090
01:27:19,749 --> 01:27:21,788
好的，谢谢
Yes, thank you.

1091
01:27:30,676 --> 01:27:33,049
 Hi.  Hi.

1092
01:27:36,891 --> 01:27:39,216
我们找到爱琳·霍夫曼了.
We found Irene Hoffman.

1093
01:27:40,394 --> 01:27:42,767
 哪里?  柏林.
 Where?  Berlin.

1094
01:27:42,897 --> 01:27:44,308
柏林?
Berlin, eh?

1095
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:49,398
她结婚了，她现在是叫沃尔纳 所以我们找不到她
She got married. Her name is Wallner now. That's why we couldn't Iocate her.

1096
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:52,529
 她什么时候来?  她不来
 When is she coming?  She's not coming.

1097
01:27:52,657 --> 01:27:56,405
 你说她不来是什么意思?  她不想来
 What do you mean, she's not coming?  She doesn't want to come.

1098
01:27:56,536 --> 01:28:00,996
你也知道的， 没有人想再作证了.
You know what it's Iike. None of them want to testify any more.

1099
01:28:01,123 --> 01:28:06,877
如果午夜赶去， 明天下午我能赶回来.
If I catch the midnight, I can get to Berlin and be back by tomorrow afternoon.

1100
01:28:07,004 --> 01:28:10,373
 你还没睡过...  如果找到霍夫曼那是值得的.
 Tad, you haven't slept...  It will be worth it if I can get Hoffman.

1101
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:13,841
明天早上法庭由你负责?
Take over for me in court in the morning, will you?

1102
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:10,560
上校，你一来我就告诉过你.
(man) Colonel, please. I have told you this before when you first came in.

1103
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:14,525
我现在再说一遍： 我们已经与此案无关了
I say it again now: we are through with all this.

1104
01:29:14,655 --> 01:29:17,526
她没必要去， 你没权力要她去
She does not have to go. You have no right to order her to.

1105
01:29:18,262 --> 01:29:23,065
沃尔纳先生, 我不是要命令她走. 我没有那样的权力.
Mr Wallner, lm not ordering her to go. I have no authority to do that.

1106
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:26,362
你不是觉得我们出席审判就能获奖吧?
Do you think we get a medal for appearing at these trials?

1107
01:29:26,537 --> 01:29:31,205
人民不喜欢这样, 他们不喜欢德国人做出对同胞的不利证明.
The people do not like them, they do not want Germans to testify against Germans.

1108
01:29:31,475 --> 01:29:36,310
这两年我在不知情的情况下， 一直没有处理这些案子.
I haven't been prosecuting these cases for the past two years without knowing that.

1109
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:46,661
你说走是很容易的.
It is easy for you to say go.

1110
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:50,574
审判结束后你就回美国了， 但我们还是要同人民继续一起生活.
After the trials you go back to America, but we must live with these people.

1111
01:29:50,711 --> 01:29:54,294
沃尔纳先生, 你不觉得我知道我正要问的吗?
Mr Wallner, don't you think I realise what I'm asking?

1112
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:56,463
你怎么可以像盖世太保一样...
How can you come in like the Gestapo...

1113
01:29:56,592 --> 01:30:00,506
因为他们要为自己的作为付出代价!
Because they must not be allowed to get away with what they did!

1114
01:30:02,473 --> 01:30:06,636
你认为他们到最后也不会逃脱吗?
Do you really think they won't get away with it in the end?

1115
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:11,435
对天发誓如此.
I say the hell with them and the hell with you.

1116
01:30:11,565 --> 01:30:13,439
好
Hugo.

1117
01:30:23,535 --> 01:30:26,205
爱米尔·哈恩会在场吗?
Emil Hahn will be there?

1118
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:29,947
是的，在法庭
Yes. In the dock.

1119
01:30:32,753 --> 01:30:34,793
欧内斯特·姜宁?
Ernst Janning?

1120
01:30:36,382 --> 01:30:38,421
是的.
Yes.

1121
01:30:47,643 --> 01:30:50,181
你看到楼下的店铺了吧.
You saw the store downstairs.

1122
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:57,187
虽然小本经营， 但对我们来说是新的开始.
It's not much, but it's a new start for us.

1123
01:30:59,989 --> 01:31:02,943
如果我去纽伦堡他们就会来.
They will come if I go to Nuremberg.

1124
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:09,783
他们会砸了店铺.
They will come and break the windows of the store.

1125
01:31:09,915 --> 01:31:12,786
我会让守卫24小时守护.
I'll place a guard in front of the store 24 hours a day.

1126
01:31:12,918 --> 01:31:17,710
 你没必要去, 爱琳...  爱琳, 你务必要去.
 You do not have to go, lrene...  lrene, you do have to go.

1127
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,920
你要为那些站不起来的人民而去.
You have to go for all the people who can't get on the stand themselves.

1128
01:31:22,052 --> 01:31:26,264
 你不亏欠任何人, 爱琳.  不，你有!
 You do not owe it to anybody, lrene.  Yes, you do!

1129
01:31:27,808 --> 01:31:32,055
你至少对不起一个人.
You owe it to one person at least.

1130
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:43,069
(sobs)

1131
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:54,581
在晚上...
In the night...

1132
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,749
每天晚上...
every night...

1133
01:31:58,172 --> 01:32:02,039
我们早知道会有这样的结果.
we've known somehow it would come to this.

1134
01:32:18,192 --> 01:32:21,691
Dr Geuter, 你还记得那标题吗?
(Radnitz) Dr Geuter, do you recognise that headline?

1135
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,065
是的
Yes, sir.

1136
01:32:23,197 --> 01:32:25,735
你可以当庭宣读吗?
Would you read it to the tribunal?

1137
01:32:25,866 --> 01:32:28,025
"种族污染."
"Death to the race defiler."

1138
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:33,155
 在什么报纸里刊登的呢?  朱利叶斯日报.
 In what newspaper did it appear?  Julius Streicher's Der Sturmer.

1139
01:32:33,499 --> 01:32:36,535
这同什么案子有关?
What was it in connection with?

1140
01:32:36,669 --> 01:32:38,661
费尔德斯特的案子.
The Feldenstein case.

1141
01:32:38,796 --> 01:32:41,121
什么费尔德斯特案子?
What was the Feldenstein case?

1142
01:32:41,256 --> 01:32:45,717
法官大人! 被告提交介绍费尔德斯特案子的资料.
Your Honour! The defence objects to introduction of the Feldenstein case.

1143
01:32:45,844 --> 01:32:49,593
这是个荒谬的案子, 只怕是当时期最荒谬的.
It is a notorious case, perhaps the most notorious of the period.

1144
01:32:49,723 --> 01:32:56,473
既没有相关主题， 又掺加感情因素.
It has overtones and appeals to emotion that would perhaps be best not raised.

1145
01:32:57,648 --> 01:33:01,811
与案件无关的资料不需提交.
There are no issues or overtones that may not be raised in this courtroom.

1146
01:33:01,944 --> 01:33:08,860
但本庭对案件相关的内容都感兴趣 反对驳回.
The tribunal is interested in everything that is relevant. Objection is overruled.

1147
01:33:11,328 --> 01:33:13,784
好，接下来我来.
It's all right. I'll take it.

1148
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:20,162
-法官大人，可以继续吗? -请继续.
 May it please the tribunal?  You may continue.

1149
01:33:20,296 --> 01:33:22,335
谢谢
Thank you.

1150
01:33:30,556 --> 01:33:34,803
那么， 费尔德斯特的案子到底是怎么回事呢?
Now, what was the Feldenstein case?

1151
01:33:35,603 --> 01:33:39,434
是有关原告因种族污染而指控被告.
The case of a man accused of racial pollution.

1152
01:33:39,565 --> 01:33:43,609
你能否解释一下什么是“种族污染”?
Will you explain what is meant by "racial pollution"?

1153
01:33:44,653 --> 01:33:49,814
这是根据纽伦堡法律来说的.
This is the charge that is referred to in the Nuremberg laws.

1154
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:56,404
任何非印欧语系的人同印欧语系人种 发生性关系将有可能被判处死刑
Any non-Aryan having sexual relations with an Aryan may be punished by death.

1155
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:01,167
你什么时候知道费尔德斯特的案子呢?
When did you first become acquainted with the Feldenstein case?

1156
01:34:02,087 --> 01:34:06,215
在1935年9月 警方联系到我.
In September 1 935 I was contacted by the police.

1157
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:09,592
告诉我费尔德斯特先生被拘禁了
They said that Mr Feldenstein was being held

1158
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:14,049
费尔德斯特先生要求我来做法律顾问
and that he requested that I serve as his counsellor.

1159
01:34:14,183 --> 01:34:16,555
他当时是什么出身?
What position did he hold in the community?

1160
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:19,355
他是非常有名的商人.
He was a very well-known merchant.

1161
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,857
他是纽伦堡犹太教会组织领导之一.
He was one of the heads of the Jewish Congregation in Nuremberg.

1162
01:34:23,984 --> 01:34:27,768
警方以什么罪名起诉他?
What was the nature of the charge against him?

1163
01:34:28,572 --> 01:34:32,212
他被起诉同16岁的爱琳·霍夫曼
He was accused of having intimate relations

1164
01:34:32,242 --> 01:34:36,074
有亲密关系
with a 16-year-old girl, lrene Hoffman.

1165
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:39,321
我明白了
(Lawson) I see.

1166
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:43,456
然后他对你说了什么?
And what did he say to you about the case?

1167
01:34:43,587 --> 01:34:45,461
他说是冤枉的.
He said it was false.

1168
01:34:45,589 --> 01:34:48,507
他说他早就认识小女孩同她的家人.
He said he knew the girl and her family a long time.

1169
01:34:48,634 --> 01:34:50,959
在父母死后他总去看她.
He'd gone to visit her since they died.

1170
01:34:51,095 --> 01:34:54,962
但是他们没有什么亲密关系.
But there had never been anything of the kind charged between them.

1171
01:34:56,976 --> 01:35:01,934
医生，能否请你告诉法庭接下来发生了什么?
Doctor, would you please tell the tribunal what happened then?

1172
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:06,854
他在没有经过特别法庭审理就直接被起诉了.
He was indicted before the special court at Nuremberg.

1173
01:35:06,986 --> 01:35:09,311
特别法庭在哪里?
(Lawson) Where was this special court?

1174
01:35:09,446 --> 01:35:14,239
就在这里， 这里的特别庭.
It was right here. This building. This very courtroom.

1175
01:35:14,368 --> 01:35:20,204
盖特博士, 当时的审判庭情形如何?
Dr Geuter, what were the circumstances surrounding the trial?

1176
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:27,292
是纳粹主义耀武扬威的地方.
It was used as a showplace for National Socialism.

1177
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:34,925
当时正值纽伦堡9月欢庆.
It was the time of the September celebrations, the Nuremberg rallies.

1178
01:35:35,055 --> 01:35:37,807
法庭里人潮拥挤.
The courtroom was crowded.

1179
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:41,100
就在后面站满了人.
Back there, people were standing up.

1180
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:46,351
朱利叶斯就坐在前排的位置.
Julius Streicher was sitting in one of the front seats.

1181
01:35:46,483 --> 01:35:50,695
纳粹党的高员们也都到场了.
And high officials of the Nazi party were all over.

1182
01:35:50,821 --> 01:35:54,653
医生，能否告诉我们
Doctor, would you please tell us

1183
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:58,995
你当时如何预料审判趋势?
what were your expectations for the trial in this climate?

1184
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:01,529
我做最坏打算
I expected the worst

1185
01:36:01,665 --> 01:36:07,039
当我看到爱米尔·哈恩是公诉人
when I saw that Emil Hahn was the public prosecutor.

1186
01:36:07,755 --> 01:36:09,794
他是狂热分子
He was a fanatic.

1187
01:36:09,923 --> 01:36:15,084
他的审判以野蛮残酷著称
His trials were always marked by extreme brutality.

1188
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:22,592
但我还是抱着一丝希望,
But I had one hope for the outcome,

1189
01:36:25,105 --> 01:36:30,444
因为坐在审判席的还有欧内斯特·姜宁.
because sitting on the judge's bench was Ernst Janning.

1190
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:35,770
他的声誉全国知晓.
His reputation was known throughout Germany.

1191
01:36:35,908 --> 01:36:43,529
他以全身心贡献于法律正义闻名
He was known to have dedicated his life to justice, to the concept of justice.

1192
01:36:46,752 --> 01:36:48,792
谢谢，问答毕
Thank you. That's all.

1193
01:36:51,799 --> 01:36:53,838
还有问题吗?
(Haywood) Any questions?

1194
01:36:55,261 --> 01:36:57,467
谢谢，没有
Thank you. No questions.

1195
01:36:57,596 --> 01:36:59,636

01:48:29,204 --> 01:48:33,783
有一名医生描述如何执行绞刑,
One of the doctors described how they'd then place ropes around their necks,

1331
01:48:33,917 --> 01:48:36,409
用医生的语言描述就是:
and in the doctor's own words:

1332
01:48:36,545 --> 01:48:42,749
"就像图画一样， 他们被钓死在墙上."
"Like pictures, they were then hanged by hooks on the walls."

1333
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:50,304
大批人员在集装车厢中运输,
The bodies of those who had come in boxcars,

1334
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:53,103
没有足够的食物和空气,
without food and without air,

1335
01:48:53,228 --> 01:48:57,522
最后坚持不到达靠.
who hadn't survived the journey to Dachau.

1336
01:48:57,650 --> 01:49:00,319
数以千计的人被用作白老鼠，
Hundreds of inmates were used as human guinea pigs

1337
01:49:00,444 --> 01:49:04,193
用作医学实验对象
for atrocious medical experiments.

1338
01:49:06,367 --> 01:49:12,239
一位现场的目击证人给出如下描述:
A witness at an execution at Dachau gave the following description:

1339
01:49:13,374 --> 01:49:16,624
"他们被要求脱光衣服."
"lnmates were made to leave their clothing on a rack."

1340
01:49:17,211 --> 01:49:20,829
"他们以为是去洗澡."
"They were told they were going to take baths."

1341
01:49:20,965 --> 01:49:23,965
"然后门就锁上了."
"Then the doors were locked."

1342
01:49:24,093 --> 01:49:29,798
"大量的毒气从管道中喷出."
"Tins of Zyklon B were released through the specially constructed apertures."

1343
01:49:31,642 --> 01:49:36,600
"你可以听到里面的呻吟残叫声."
"You could hear the groaning and the whimpering inside."

1344
01:49:36,772 --> 01:49:41,066
"两三分钟后， 一切归于平静."
"After two or three minutes, all was quiet."

1345
01:49:49,410 --> 01:49:55,199
死亡数据统计 90,000 来自斯洛伐克
Death transports that had arrived included 90,000 from Slovakia,

1346
01:49:57,084 --> 01:49:59,836

01:50:21,609 --> 01:50:24,526
另外100,000 来自德国
and 100,000 from Germany.

1352
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:30,029
这些就是当盟军解放贝尔森集中营的时候
And this is what was filmed

1353
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:34,203
所拍摄到的
when British troops liberated Belsen concentration camp.

1354
01:50:38,542 --> 01:50:45,420
处于卫生考虑， 只好用推土机尽快掩埋尸体
For sanitary reasons a British bulldozer had to bury the bodies as quickly as possible.

1355
01:50:52,056 --> 01:50:54,511
这些尸体是谁?
Who were the bodies?

1356
01:50:55,851 --> 01:50:59,765
欧洲被占领国家的人民.
Members of every occupied country of Europe.

1357
01:51:00,898 --> 01:51:06,354
欧洲2/3的犹太人遭到了灭绝.
Two-thirds of the Jews of Europe... exterminated.

1358
01:51:08,072 --> 01:51:10,111
超过了6，000，000
More than six million,

1359
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:16,029
这是根据纳粹的数据报告.
according to reports from the Nazis' own figures.

1360
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:21,664
但真实的数据又是多少呢...
But the real figure...

1361
01:51:26,674 --> 01:51:28,713
没有人知道
no one knows.

1362
01:51:35,474 --> 01:51:39,602
他们怎么敢让我们看那些录象? 怎么敢?
How dare they show us those films? How dare they?

1363
01:51:40,271 --> 01:51:43,853
我们不是刽子手! 我们是裁判者.
We are not executioners! We are judges.

1364
01:51:43,983 --> 01:51:47,352
你认为不该是那样的对吗?
You do not think it was like that, do you?

1365
01:51:49,071 --> 01:51:52,772
那是执行死刑， 不过不应该是那样的.
There were executions, yes, but nothing like that.

1366
01:51:52,908 --> 01:51:54,948
根本不该是!
Nothing at all!

1367
01:52:00,916 --> 01:52:02,541
波!
Pohl!

1368
01:52:03,002 --> 01:52:05,041
波!
Pohl!

1369
01:52:06,839 --> 01:52:11,465
是你同艾克曼负责集中营的,
You ran those concentration camps, you and Eichmann.

1370
01:52:12,303 --> 01:52:15,754
他们说我们屠杀了百万人
They say we killed millions of people.

1371
01:52:15,889 --> 01:52:17,847
百万人!
Millions of people!

1372
01:52:17,975 --> 01:52:20,810
怎么可能?
How could it be possible?

1373
01:52:20,936 --> 01:52:24,768
告诉他们！ 怎么可能?
Tell them! How could it be possible?

1374
01:52:27,818 --> 01:52:29,858
是可以的
It's possible.

1375
01:52:30,821 --> 01:52:32,778
如何做?
How?

1376
01:52:32,906 --> 01:52:34,946
你说技术上?
You mean technically?

1377
01:52:36,827 --> 01:52:39,579
全要依靠你的工具设备.
It all depends on your facilities.

1378
01:52:39,705 --> 01:52:44,211
你有两幢每单间可以容纳2，000人的房间.
Say you have two chambers that accommodate 2,000 people apiece.

1379
01:52:44,251 --> 01:52:46,010
总的算一下
Figure it out.

1380
01:52:46,145 --> 01:52:51,124
在半小时内就可以解决10，000人
It's possible to get rid of 1 0,000 in a half hour.

1381
01:52:51,258 --> 01:52:53,963
你也不需要让守卫来动手
You don't even need guards to do it.

1382
01:52:54,094 --> 01:52:57,095
你告诉他们要洗澡了,
You can tell them they are going to take a shower,

1383
01:52:57,222 --> 01:53:01,434
接下来你不是开水龙头， 只要开毒气就可以了.
and then instead of the water, you turn on the gas.

1384
01:53:02,144 --> 01:53:07,483
杀人不是问题， 问题是如何处理尸体.
It's not the killing that is the problem. It's disposing of the bodies.

1385
01:53:07,608 --> 01:53:09,647
那才是问题
That's the problem.

1386
01:53:17,368 --> 01:53:20,618
# Das ist schon

1387
01:53:20,746 --> 01:53:22,703
# Wunderschon

1388
01:53:22,831 --> 01:53:24,871
# Das tut gut

1389
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,454
# Was man alles im Liebesrausch tut

1390
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:37,594
# Und zur Nacht flliegt ein fllusterndes Fleh'n

1391
01:53:37,721 --> 01:53:45,136
# "ach verweile, du bist ja so schon"

1392
01:53:45,354 --> 01:53:51,226
# Doch die Liebe bleibt nur, wo sie ist

1393
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:58,157
# Wenn man immer aufls neue sich kusst

1394
01:53:58,284 --> 01:53:59,742
# Und so lebt...

1395
01:53:59,868 --> 01:54:02,194
 对不起，我迟到了.  没关系.
 I'm sorry I'm late.  That's all right.

1396
01:54:02,329 --> 01:54:06,742
我在处理重建委员会的事情.
I was doing some work for the rebuilding committee.

1397
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:12,288
我给你带了文件看看， 好决定接下来要怎么办.
I brought you some folders so we can decide what you should see next.

1398
01:54:12,423 --> 01:54:15,839
那才是真正的房屋艺术.
There's the Albrecht Durer house. And the museum.

1399
01:54:15,968 --> 01:54:19,668
 你认为你什么时候可以处理?  随时.
 When do you think you could make it?  Any time.

1400
01:54:19,805 --> 01:54:24,301
 现在可以点菜了吗?  让我来点好吗?
 Would you like to order now?  Can I help you with the menu?

1401
01:54:24,435 --> 01:54:26,973
我想我什么都不要，谢谢.
I don't think I'll have anything, thank you.

1402
01:54:27,104 --> 01:54:29,393
一杯摩泽尔葡萄酒
A glass of Moselle, please.

1403
01:54:29,523 --> 01:54:31,563
摩泽尔
Moselle.

1404
01:54:34,111 --> 01:54:36,151
怎么了?
What is the matter?

1405
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:39,863
没什么，我就是不饿
Nothing. I'm just not hungry, that's all.

1406
01:54:46,707 --> 01:54:48,746
你知道...
You know...

1407
01:54:50,294 --> 01:54:53,544
最后的日子对我很重要.
the last few days have meant a great deal to me.

1408
01:54:53,672 --> 01:54:55,665
怎么?
How?

1409
01:54:55,799 --> 01:55:00,841
我想你不知道我曾四处流浪.
I don't think you realise what a provincial man I really am.

1410
01:55:01,555 --> 01:55:05,719
在这之前我也出国过一次.
I've been abroad just exactly once before this.

1411
01:55:05,851 --> 01:55:08,556
那时是“一战”时， 我是一名步兵.
That was when I was a doughboy in World War l.

1412
01:55:08,687 --> 01:55:12,767
以前我总到这些地方， 很好奇.
I used to pass places like this and wonder what they were like.

1413
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:16,103
 他们对我也影响很大  怎么?
 They've meant a great deal to me, too.  How?

1414
01:55:16,236 --> 01:55:19,440
他们给了我美国一样的感觉.
They gave me back the feeling I had of the Americans.

1415
01:55:19,573 --> 01:55:23,986
当我在你的国家时所有的那种感觉.
The feeling I used to have when I was in your country.

1416
01:55:26,872 --> 01:55:29,280
真遗憾这不是什么杂志故事
It's too bad this isn't a magazine story.

1417
01:55:29,416 --> 01:55:30,448
为什么?
Why?

1418
01:55:30,584 --> 01:55:35,080
如果是，我们两个 一个成熟老迈的法学家...
If it were, two people like us, the rapidly ageing jurist...

1419
01:55:35,214 --> 01:55:36,673
噢，不
Oh, no.

1420
01:55:36,799 --> 01:55:40,417
一个成熟老迈的法学家和一个漂亮的寡妇
The rapidly ageing jurist and the beautiful widow

1421
01:55:40,552 --> 01:55:47,385
将会克服重重困难， 穿越各种险阻.
would transcend their difficulties and travel places either by land or by sea.

1422
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:03,648
今天我见到马克斯
I saw Mr Perkins today.

1423
01:56:03,784 --> 01:56:07,616
他告诉我在法庭展示的录象
He told me they showed those pictures in the courtroom,

1424
01:56:07,746 --> 01:56:10,154
劳森上校最喜欢的图片
Colonel Lawson's favourite pictures.

1425
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:14,119
他总是推脱不肯出示，对吧?
He drags them out at any pretext, doesn't he?

1426
01:56:14,253 --> 01:56:17,538
劳森上校的个人恐怖收藏
Colonel Lawson's private chamber of horrors.

1427
01:56:20,634 --> 01:56:25,545
这就是你认为的我们? 你认为我们知道这些事情吗?
Is that what you think we are? Do you think we knew of those things?

1428
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:30,094
你觉得我们希望屠杀妇女和小孩么?
Do you think we wanted to murder women and children?

1429
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:34,769
你相信吗? 信么?
Do you believe that? Do you?

1430
01:56:36,692 --> 01:56:40,310
柏斯德夫人, 我不知道要相信什么
Mrs Bertholt, I don't know what to believe.

1431
01:56:40,446 --> 01:56:44,230
天， 我们在这里喝酒
Good God. We're sitting here drinking.

1432
01:56:44,366 --> 01:56:47,118
你怎么就认为我们知道?
How could you think that we knew?

1433
01:56:47,286 --> 01:56:49,492
我们不知道
We did not know.

1434
01:56:49,622 --> 01:56:51,661
我们不知道
We did not know!

1435
01:56:53,751 --> 01:56:58,080
据我所知， 这个国家的人都不知道.
As far as I can make out, no one in this country knew.

1436
01:57:00,382 --> 01:57:04,546
柏斯德夫人,你丈夫是军队指挥之一.
Mrs Bertholt, your husband was one of the heads of the army.

1437
01:57:04,678 --> 01:57:07,549
那么我来告诉你， 他不知道.
And he did not know. I tell you, he did not know.

1438
01:57:07,681 --> 01:57:11,264
是西姆莱、戈贝斯和SS， 他们知道发生了什么事情
It was Himmler. It was Goebbels. The SS knew what happened.

1439
01:57:11,393 --> 01:57:13,220
我们不知道
We did not know.

1440
01:57:13,354 --> 01:57:17,814
听着，事情有两面性.
Listen to me. There are things that happened on both sides.

1441
01:57:17,942 --> 01:57:21,227
我丈夫一生都是军人.
My husband was a military man all his life.

1442
01:57:21,987 --> 01:57:25,237
他应该享受军人的葬礼， 这也是他希望的.
He was entitled to a soldier's death. He asked for that.

1443
01:57:25,366 --> 01:57:29,659
我只是想为他争取， 仅仅如此而已.
I tried to get that for him. Just that, that he would die with some honour.

1444
01:57:29,787 --> 01:57:34,579
我四处拜访!
I went from official to official. I begged for that!

1445
01:57:34,708 --> 01:57:39,038
他应该死的尊严.
That he should be permitted the dignity of a firing squad.

1446
01:57:39,797 --> 01:57:41,836
你知道发生什么了吗.
You know what happened.

1447
01:57:43,175 --> 01:57:49,260
他同其他人一样被绞死了， 我恨所有人.
He was hanged with the others. And after that, I knew what it was to hate.

1448
01:57:49,390 --> 01:57:53,518
我没有离开房间一步， 只是酗酒
I never left the house. I never left the room. I drank.

1449
01:57:53,644 --> 01:57:59,896
我恨一切， 恨我所认识的一切美国人.
I hated with every fibre of my being. I hated every American I've ever known.

1450
01:58:00,025 --> 01:58:03,525
但我知道人不能因为仇恨活着.
But one can't live with hate. I know that.

1451
01:58:07,241 --> 01:58:09,613
丹,
Dan,

1452
01:58:09,743 --> 01:58:14,037
如果我们要继续生活， 就要学会遗忘.
we have to forget if we are to go on living.

1453
01:58:14,164 --> 01:58:15,956
(crowd singing "Liebeslied")

1454
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:18,040
# Du darflst aufl mich bauen

1455
01:58:18,168 --> 01:58:21,288
# WeiBt ja, wie gut ich dir bin

1456
01:58:21,422 --> 01:58:25,371
# Ja, ja, ja, ja

1457
01:58:25,509 --> 01:58:29,293
# Weisst doch, wie gut ich dir bin.

1458
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:33,474
# Und, und, wenn in der Ferne

1459
01:58:33,601 --> 01:58:37,384
# Dir, dir, mein Bild erscheint

1460
01:58:37,521 --> 01:58:41,056
# Dann, dann, wunscht' ich so gerne

1461
01:58:41,191 --> 01:58:43,979
# Dass uns die Liebe vereint

1462
01:59:02,630 --> 01:59:04,669
罗尔福.
Herr Rolfe.

1463
01:59:25,152 --> 01:59:27,477
尊敬的法官大人.
May it please the tribunal.

1464
01:59:32,826 --> 01:59:36,824
昨天看过了录象资料.
Yesterday the tribunal witnessed some films.

1465
01:59:38,082 --> 01:59:43,040
那些是……骇人听闻的录象.
They were... shocking films.

1466
01:59:43,837 --> 01:59:45,877
另人震惊的录象
Devastating films.

1467
01:59:47,508 --> 01:59:49,547
作为德国人,
As a German,

1468
01:59:51,929 --> 01:59:57,801
我为这样的事情发生在我国而羞耻.
I feel ashamed that such things could have taken place in my country.

1469
01:59:59,228 --> 02:00:04,056
这是毫无道理的,
There can never be a justification for them,

1470
02:00:04,191 --> 02:00:08,983
世世代代都不会有道理.
not in generations, not in centuries.

1471
02:00:12,866 --> 02:00:14,906
但是...
But...

1472
02:00:17,162 --> 02:00:20,614
我认为这也没错,
I do think it was wrong,

1473
02:00:22,459 --> 02:00:30,251
在此情此景，展示这些录象资料
indecent and terribly unfair of the prosecution

1474
02:00:30,301 --> 02:00:37,347
对于在席的被告，这是非常下流
to show such films in this case, in this court, at this time

1475
02:00:37,474 --> 02:00:40,226
无耻的公诉!
against these defendants!

1476
02:00:40,352 --> 02:00:45,857
我不得不强烈抗议这样的做法.
And I cannot protest too strongly against such tactics.

1477
02:00:53,407 --> 02:00:57,274
公诉人到底想要证明什么?
What is the prosecution trying to prove?

1478
02:00:57,411 --> 02:01:02,618
难道是全德国人都要对事件负责?
That the German people as a whole were responsible for these events?

1479
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:05,667
或者还是全德国人都是知情的?
Or that they were even aware of them?

1480
02:01:05,794 --> 02:01:08,120
如果是的话,
Because, if he is,

1481
02:01:09,798 --> 02:01:12,087
那他就不是陈述事实
he's not stating facts

1482
02:01:13,385 --> 02:01:16,007
他知道他不是.
and he knows he's not.

1483
02:01:18,641 --> 02:01:21,310
军事操作的秘密,
The secrecy of the operations,

1484
02:01:21,435 --> 02:01:24,008
战俘营的地理方位,
the geographical location of the camps,

1485
02:01:24,146 --> 02:01:27,811
战争后期通信的破坏
the breakdown of communications in the last days of the war

1486
02:01:27,942 --> 02:01:30,729
当死亡变成了百万之数,
when the exterminations rose into the millions,

1487
02:01:30,861 --> 02:01:35,155
这只能说明他不是在说明事实.
show only too clearly that he is not telling the truth.

1488
02:01:35,282 --> 02:01:42,198
事实是这些暴行是由少数人操作的.
The truth is that these brutalities were brought about by the few extremists.

1489
02:01:42,331 --> 02:01:44,370
那些罪犯.
The criminals.

1490
02:01:46,168 --> 02:01:49,371
极少数德国人知道发生了什么.
Very few Germans knew what was going on.

1491
02:01:49,505 --> 02:01:51,544
极少
Very few.

1492
02:01:52,591 --> 02:01:58,511
我们到不知道录象中的地方， 发生了什么事情
None of us knew what was happening in the places shown on these films.

1493
02:01:59,807 --> 02:02:01,846
没有一个知道
None of us.

1494
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:10,855
但最讽刺的是
But the most ironic part of it

1495
02:02:10,985 --> 02:02:17,521
检查官却以此公诉对抗被告,
is that the prosecution showed these films against these defendants,

1496
02:02:17,658 --> 02:02:22,534
被告只为一个理由而拥有权力:
men who stayed in power for one reason only:

1497
02:02:22,663 --> 02:02:26,162
防止更坏的结果发生
to prevent worse things from happening.

1498
02:02:27,084 --> 02:02:29,753
谁才是更勇敢的人呢?
Who is the braver man?

1499
02:02:29,878 --> 02:02:34,007
在危难中逃跑或辞职的人?
The man who escapes or resigns in times of peril?

1500
02:02:34,883 --> 02:02:41,088
还是置身死不顾坚守岗位的人?
Or the man who stays on his post at the risk of his own personal safety?

1501
02:02:41,765 --> 02:02:46,059
被告接下来出示的证人证物
The defence will present witnesses and letters and documents

1502
02:02:46,186 --> 02:02:48,724
来自全球各界宗教团体
from religious and political refugees all over the world

1503
02:02:48,856 --> 02:02:52,022
说明欧内斯特·姜宁是怎么样从死刑中解救了他们
telling how Ernst Janning saved them from execution.

1504
02:02:52,151 --> 02:02:54,689
被告还会证明
The defence will show the many times

1505
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:57,856
在没有欧内斯特·姜宁法官作用影响下
Ernst Janning was able to effect mitigation of sentences,

1506
02:02:57,990 --> 02:03:02,901
结果会更严重
when without his influence the results would have been much worse.

1507
02:03:03,037 --> 02:03:05,575
被告还会证明
The defence will show

1508
02:03:05,706 --> 02:03:10,997
欧内斯特·姜宁的私人医生是非雅利安人
that Ernst Janning's personal physician was a non-Aryan.

1509
02:03:11,128 --> 02:03:16,632
保留一个犹太人出席作证是相当危险.
A Jewish man who he kept in attendance, much to his own peril.

1510
02:03:20,596 --> 02:03:23,924
被告方宣誓
The defence presents affidavits

1511
02:03:23,974 --> 02:03:27,924
from legal authorities and famed jurists the world over,

1512
02:03:28,062 --> 02:03:32,225
恳求在此案中要特别考虑,
pleading that special consideration must be made in this case,

1513
02:03:32,358 --> 02:03:38,610
欧内斯特·姜宁所有的工作灵感都源于:
saying that the entire work of Ernst Janning was inspired by one motive only:

1514
02:03:38,739 --> 02:03:44,113
尽力保存正义以及正义感.
the endeavour to preserve justice and the concept of justice.

1515
02:03:47,998 --> 02:03:56,207
现在，公诉人还有什么要对抗的呢?
Now, what has the prosecution to offer against this?

1516
02:03:57,257 --> 02:04:02,216
在针对欧内斯特·姜宁的起诉中，
The prosecution, in fact, has presented in the case of Ernst Janning

1517
02:04:02,346 --> 02:04:05,347
只有一件有事实根据的证据.
only one tangible piece of evidence.

1518
02:04:05,474 --> 02:04:08,760
费尔德斯特的案子 正如被告说的一样：臭名远播
The Feldenstein case. A notorious case, as the defence said.

1519
02:04:08,894 --> 02:04:11,432
一件不应开审的案子.
A case which never should have been reopened.

1520
02:04:11,563 --> 02:04:16,724
一件另被告不得不审理的案子.
A case which the defence is obliged to review now.

1521
02:04:18,612 --> 02:04:21,234
被告请求艾尔莎夫人出庭作证.
The defence calls Mrs Elsa Lindnow.

1522
02:04:39,675 --> 02:04:41,964
请举右手?
Will you raise your right hand?

1523
02:04:42,094 --> 02:04:44,051
我向全能无所不知的主发誓
I swear by God the Almighty and Omniscient

1524
02:04:44,179 --> 02:04:47,383
我会说出事实的真相， 绝无虚假.
that I will speak the pure truth and withhold and add nothing.

1525
02:04:47,516 --> 02:04:49,556
我会的
I do.

1526
02:04:52,813 --> 02:04:54,853
艾尔莎夫人
Mrs Lindnow.

1527
02:04:57,484 --> 02:04:59,691
你的工作是?
What is your occupation?

1528
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:01,860
清洁女工.
I am a cleaning woman.

1529
02:05:02,364 --> 02:05:05,199
哪里工作?
Where are you employed?

1530
02:05:05,326 --> 02:05:10,450
格罗配街345号
4... 345 Grosseplatz.

1531
02:05:10,581 --> 02:05:13,950
 你认识雷曼·费尔德斯特么? -是的，认识
 Did you know Lehman Feldenstein?  Yes, I knew him.

1532
02:05:14,084 --> 02:05:19,671
 怎么认识的?  在1935我给他干活.
 In what capacity?  He was my employer in 1935.

1533
02:05:19,798 --> 02:05:22,171
你认识爱琳·霍夫曼么?
Do you know Mrs lrene Hoffman Wallner?

1534
02:05:22,301 --> 02:05:23,629
是
Yes.

1535
02:05:23,761 --> 02:05:28,470
 怎么认识的?  她是那里的房客.
 In what capacity?  She was a tenant in the building.

1536
02:05:28,599 --> 02:05:33,060
你有没有见到霍夫曼小姐同费尔德斯特先生一起?
Did you ever see Miss Hoffman and Mr Feldenstein together?

1537
02:05:33,187 --> 02:05:36,686
 是.  到底怎么回事?
 Yes.  How did this happen?

1538
02:05:36,815 --> 02:05:41,857
费尔德斯特先生到 霍夫曼小姐的公寓去看她
Mr Feldenstein came to see Miss Hoffman at her apartment.

1539
02:05:42,488 --> 02:05:45,821
 经常吗?  常常
 Often?  Quite often.

1540
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:49,817
你有发现什么不正常的情况吗?
Were there any occasions in which you noticed anything unusual?

1541
02:05:49,954 --> 02:05:51,993
是
Yes.

1542
02:05:52,122 --> 02:05:58,659
我见到霍夫曼小姐在楼下， 吻了费尔德斯特先生
I saw Miss Hoffman kissing Mr Feldenstein at the door of her apartment.

1543
02:05:58,796 --> 02:06:03,588
 还有其他场合吗?  是的，有一次.
 Was there any other occasion?  Yes. There was one.

1544
02:06:03,717 --> 02:06:08,344
 怎么样?  我到了霍夫曼小姐的房间.
 What was it?  I came to Miss Hoffman's apartment.

1545
02:06:08,472 --> 02:06:12,968
我以为没人， 所以就去清理.
I wanted to clean up. I thought it was empty.

1546
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:20,224
我看到霍夫曼小姐坐在费尔德斯特先生的大腿上.
I saw Miss Hoffman sitting on Mr Feldenstein's lap.

1547
02:06:20,359 --> 02:06:23,645
谢谢，就这些了
Thank you, Mrs Lindnow. That's all.

1548
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:28,029
劳森上校?
Colonel Lawson?

1549
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:35,453
请戴上耳机
Earphones, please.

1550
02:06:38,168 --> 02:06:42,795
夫人, 你的政治面貌?
Mrs Lindnow, what are your political affiliations?

1551
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:46,461
政治面貌?
Political?

1552
02:06:46,594 --> 02:06:48,716
反对，法官大人.
Objection, Your Honour.

1553
02:06:50,431 --> 02:06:54,511
证人的政治面貌同她的证词无关.
This witness' political affiliations have nothing to do with the testimony.

1554
02:06:54,643 --> 02:06:59,638
劳森上校再次企图用感情因素影响审判
Colonel Lawson is again trying to appeal to the emotion of the court.

1555
02:06:59,773 --> 02:07:01,813
反对无效
Objection overruled.

1556
02:07:01,942 --> 02:07:04,314
请你回答?
Now would you answer the question, please?

1557
02:07:04,445 --> 02:07:08,442
你是纳粹党吗?
Were you a member of the National Socialist party?

1558
02:07:08,574 --> 02:07:11,243
是
Yes, I was.

1559
02:07:12,828 --> 02:07:14,821
我们是被迫的
We were forced to be.

1560
02:07:14,955 --> 02:07:17,280
"我们是被迫的."
"We were forced to be."

1561
02:07:18,334 --> 02:07:21,204
你什么时候成为纳粹党成员的?
When did you become a member of the Nazi party?

1562
02:07:23,464 --> 02:07:26,880
1933.
1 933.

1563
02:07:27,009 --> 02:07:33,628
所有德国人在1933年都加入纳粹党吗?
Were all German nationals forced to become Nazi party members in 1 933?

1564
02:07:34,767 --> 02:07:37,055
请回答!
Please answer me, Mrs Lindnow!

1565
02:07:37,186 --> 02:07:41,599
你是否被迫成为纳粹党?
Were you forced to become a member of the Nazi party?

1566
02:07:45,194 --> 02:07:47,021
问毕
That's all.

1567
02:07:48,322 --> 02:07:50,361
证人离席
Witness is excused.

1568
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:08,379
被告方继续.
Defence may continue.

1569
02:08:16,016 --> 02:08:20,762
被告方传召 爱琳·霍夫曼·沃尔纳出庭
The defence calls lrene Hoffman Wallner to the stand.

1570
02:08:36,662 --> 02:08:38,701
沃尔纳夫人
(Haywood) Mrs Wallner,

1571
02:08:41,125 --> 02:08:43,248
你的誓言依然有效.
you are still under oath.

1572
02:08:45,004 --> 02:08:48,040
沃尔纳夫人,你是自愿作证的吗?
Mrs Wallner, did you come here voluntarily?

1573
02:08:48,674 --> 02:08:51,959
你是自愿作证的吗?
Did you report voluntarily to speak as a witness?

1574
02:08:52,094 --> 02:08:54,134
是
Yes.

1575
02:08:55,222 --> 02:08:58,721
公诉人要求你出庭不是事实?
Is it not true that the prosecution asked you to come here?

1576
02:08:59,393 --> 02:09:02,976
你出庭时很不情愿?
That it was very disagreeable for you to come here?

1577
02:09:03,105 --> 02:09:07,233
在这样的年代， 不情愿是很正常的事情.
It is always very disagreeable to live over those times.

1578
02:09:08,777 --> 02:09:12,063
那同我知道的相符,
That would be in agreement with the information I have,

1579
02:09:12,197 --> 02:09:15,732
你是不愿出庭的. 谢谢
that you did not want to come. Thank you, Mrs Wallner.

1580
02:09:15,909 --> 02:09:17,949
沃尔纳夫人
Mrs Wallner,

1581
02:09:20,497 --> 02:09:24,744
纽伦堡法案是在1935年9月15日颁布的
the Nuremberg laws were stated September 1 5th, 1 935.

1582
02:09:25,544 --> 02:09:28,331
-当时你在哪?  在纽伦堡.
 Where were you at that time?  In Nuremberg.

1583
02:09:28,464 --> 02:09:30,503
你知道这些法案吗?
Did you know these laws?

1584
02:09:30,633 --> 02:09:35,709
同犹太人发生关系是违法的?
That a physical relationship with Jews was against the law?

1585
02:09:35,846 --> 02:09:36,842
是
Yes.

1586
02:09:36,972 --> 02:09:41,883
你知道在纽伦堡， 特别是纽伦堡,
Were you aware that in Nuremberg, and in Nuremberg in particular,

1587
02:09:42,019 --> 02:09:46,930
别说身体接触了， 就是同犹太人的一般接触也是被歧视的?
not only a physical relationship with Jews was disdained, but every social contact?

1588
02:09:47,066 --> 02:09:48,809
是
Yes.

1589
02:09:48,943 --> 02:09:52,810
你知道那样你可能有危险吗?
Were you aware that it might have some danger for you personally?

1590
02:09:52,947 --> 02:09:55,069
是，我知道
Yes, I was aware of it.

1591
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:59,576
但你怎么可以因为这些抛弃多年的友谊呢...
But how can you discard a friendship from day to day because of some...

1592
02:09:59,703 --> 02:10:05,042
那是另外的问题了,  我没有问你那个问题.
That is another question, Mrs Wallner. I did not ask you that question.

1593
02:10:05,167 --> 02:10:08,951
 你知道吗?  是，我知道.
 Were you aware of it?  Yes, I was aware.

1594
02:10:09,088 --> 02:10:11,757
那你们还是继续见面吗?
Yet you still continued to see each other?

1595
02:10:11,882 --> 02:10:13,922
是
Yes.

1596
02:10:15,219 --> 02:10:20,462
事实证明费尔德斯特先生给你买了很多甜点.
It was brought out that Mr Feldenstein bought you candy and cigarettes.

1597
02:10:20,599 --> 02:10:21,595
是
Yes.

1598
02:10:21,725 --> 02:10:24,892
还记得他给你买花吗?
Remember that sometimes he bought you flowers?

1599
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:28,021
是，他给我买了很多东西.
Yes, he bought me many things.

1600
02:10:28,148 --> 02:10:30,271
那是因为他是好人.
That was because he was kind.

1601
02:10:31,235 --> 02:10:34,319
他是我认识的最好的人
He was the kindest man I ever knew.

1602
02:10:36,907 --> 02:10:40,157
你认识证人,爱尔莎夫人么?
Do you know the witness, Mrs Elsa Lindnow?

1603
02:10:40,286 --> 02:10:41,780
是的，认识
Yes, I know her.

1604
02:10:41,912 --> 02:10:45,115
 她是你公寓的清洁女工吗?  是.
 Was she a cleaner at your apartment?  Yes.

1605
02:10:45,249 --> 02:10:48,285
费尔德斯特先生是否有到你的公寓看你?
Did Mr Feldenstein come to see you at your apartment?

1606
02:10:48,419 --> 02:10:51,088
 是.  多少次?
 Yes.  How many times?

1607
02:10:52,631 --> 02:10:55,301
我不记得.
I don't remember.

1608
02:10:55,426 --> 02:10:58,296
 几次?  是
 Several times?  Yes.

1609
02:10:58,429 --> 02:11:01,098
 很多次?  很多次
 Many times?  Many times.

1610
02:11:01,223 --> 02:11:03,797
 你吻他了吗?  是，我吻了他
 Did you kiss him?  Yes, I kissed him.

1611
02:11:03,934 --> 02:11:06,971
不止一次?
Was there more than one kiss?

1612
02:11:07,104 --> 02:11:09,560
是
Yes.

1613
02:11:09,690 --> 02:11:14,566
但不是你说的那样.
But it was not in the way you are trying to make it sound.

1614
02:11:14,695 --> 02:11:19,820
他对我来说就像父亲， 超过了父亲
He was like a father to me. He was more than a father.

1615
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:22,904
超过了父亲?! 你有坐在他腿上吗?
More than a father?! Did you sit on his lap?

1616
02:11:23,037 --> 02:11:25,872
反对!
Objection! Counsel is persecuting the witness

1617
02:11:25,998 --> 02:11:28,037
辩护律师在获取证词中迫害证人
in the pretext of gaining testimony.

1618
02:11:29,376 --> 02:11:30,954
反对无效
Objection overruled.

1619
02:11:31,086 --> 02:11:36,163
被告又在最初的地方扮演闹剧.
The defence is re-enacting what was a travesty of justice in the first place.

1620
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:41,804
劳森上校, 现在是法官席在审理， 不是公诉方.
Colonel Lawson, the tribunal makes the rulings in this case, not the prosecution.

1621
02:11:41,931 --> 02:11:44,468
 你可以继续.  你坐在他腿上吗?
 You may proceed.  Did you sit on his lap?

1622
02:11:45,392 --> 02:11:51,596
是的，但那没有什么不可见人的.
Yes. But there was nothing wrong or ugly about it.

1623
02:11:51,732 --> 02:11:54,270
你坐在他腿上吗?
Did you sit on his lap?

1624
02:11:54,401 --> 02:11:55,979
是，但是……
Yes. But...

1625
02:11:56,111 --> 02:11:58,733
你坐在他腿上! 你还做了什么?
You sat on his lap! What else did you do?

1626
02:12:00,783 --> 02:12:04,827
不是像你说的那样.
There was nothing that you are trying to say, nothing like that.

1627
02:12:04,954 --> 02:12:07,824
你还做了什么, 沃尔纳夫人?
What else did you do, Mrs Wallner?

1628
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:10,663
你到底要干什么?
What are you trying to do?

1629
02:12:12,419 --> 02:12:14,459
你是不是要...
Are you trying to...

1630
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:21,218
为什么你不让我说出真相?
Why do you not let me speak the truth?

1631
02:12:21,345 --> 02:12:25,010
那正是我们要的,  事实，事实!
That's what we want, Mrs Wallner, the truth. The truth!

1632
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,382
你承认你继续同他见面.
You admitted that you continued to see him.

1633
02:12:27,518 --> 02:12:30,056
你承认他到你的公寓.
You admitted that he came to your apartment.

1634
02:12:30,187 --> 02:12:33,770
你承认你吻了他， 坐在他腿上.
You admitted you kissed him. You admitted you sat on his lap.

1635
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:36,307
那你还做了些什么?
What else do you admit to? What else?

1636
02:12:36,443 --> 02:12:41,401
不是， 不是像你说的一样
Nothing! There was nothing like you're trying to make it sound.

1637
02:12:41,532 --> 02:12:46,443
 还有什么呢?  什么都没有，没有
 What else?  There was nothing! Nothing.

1638
02:12:46,578 --> 02:12:48,488
不要!
Stop it!

1639
02:12:48,622 --> 02:12:49,737
别说了!
 (stamps fleet)  Stop it!

1640
02:12:49,873 --> 02:12:52,246
还有什么要说的呢？
What else do you admit to, Mrs Wallner?

1641
02:12:52,376 --> 02:12:54,415
罗尔福!
Herr Rolfe!

1642
02:12:58,674 --> 02:13:00,713
我们还要这么做吗?
Are we going to do this again?

1643
02:13:06,307 --> 02:13:12,345
法官大人，在这样的压力下， 被告情绪...
Your Honour, the defendant has been under such stress that he is not aware...

1644
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:16,180
我知道，我知道
I am aware. I am aware.

1645
02:13:16,317 --> 02:13:18,855
法官大人，被告要求陈述.
Your Honour, the defendant wishes to make a statement.

1646
02:13:18,986 --> 02:13:22,604
 我认为被告有权利...  遵守秩序
 I believe the defence has a right to...  Order, order.

1647
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:24,779
遵守秩序!
 Order!  (bangs gavel)

1648
02:13:27,995 --> 02:13:30,912
被告是否要发言?
Does the defendant wish to make a statement?

1649
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:34,290
是的，我要发言
I wish to make a statement, yes.

1650
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:37,962
法官大人，被告有权请求...
Your Honour, the defence has the right to request...

1651
02:13:38,088 --> 02:13:41,089
被告有权现在发言.
The defendant has the right to make his statement now.

1652
02:13:41,216 --> 02:13:46,424
 我要同我的当事人谈谈.  他有权现在发言!
 I have to speak with my client.  He has the right to make it now!

1653
02:13:48,265 --> 02:13:49,641
(sobbing)

1654
02:13:56,315 --> 02:13:59,518
现在休庭，明早10：30继续
Tribunal is adjourned until 1 0.30 tomorrow morning.

1655
02:14:04,406 --> 02:14:06,944
你在干吗?
(Rolfle) What are you doing?

1656
02:14:07,076 --> 02:14:10,326
你以为你在干吗?
What do you think you're trying to do?

1657
02:14:10,454 --> 02:14:15,365
他们已经有格林, 富兰克... 都完了.
They've had Goring, Frank, Streicher... That's over.

1658
02:14:16,168 --> 02:14:20,830
你以为我作为被告辩护律师很光荣吗?
Do you think I have enjoyed being defence counsel during this trial?

1659
02:14:20,965 --> 02:14:24,665
在庭上我不得不猥琐
There were things I had to do in that courtroom that made me cringe.

1660
02:14:24,802 --> 02:14:27,008
我为什么要这么做?
Why did I do them?

1661
02:14:27,137 --> 02:14:30,091
因为我想为德国人保留一些东西.
Because I want to leave the German people something.

1662
02:14:30,224 --> 02:14:32,596
我想要为他们保留仅有的尊严.
I want to leave them a shred of dignity.

1663
02:14:32,726 --> 02:14:35,478
我想要停止这样的审判.
I want to call a halt to these proceedings.

1664
02:14:35,604 --> 02:14:38,724
如果我们允许他们 像处理你一样对待每个德国人,
If we allow them to discredit every German like you,

1665
02:14:38,857 --> 02:14:42,641
我们就永远没有主宰自己的权利!
we lose the right to rule ourselves forever!

1666
02:14:43,237 --> 02:14:46,820
我们要向前看，不是向后看
We have to look at the future. We can't look back now.

1667
02:14:46,949 --> 02:14:49,866
你想让美国人长驻在此吗?
Do you want the Americans to stay here forever?

1668
02:14:49,994 --> 02:14:53,778
广岛和长崎就是最好的例子.
I could show you a picture of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1669
02:14:53,914 --> 02:14:56,405
无数被烧毁的尸体.
Thousands and thousands of burnt bodies.

1670
02:14:56,542 --> 02:14:58,581
女人和孩子
Women and children.

1671
02:14:59,628 --> 02:15:02,962
这就是他们崇高的道德?
Is that their superior morality?

1672
02:15:03,090 --> 02:15:05,462
你以为他们会把我们带到哪里? 他们知道吗?
Where do you think they take us? Do they know?

1673
02:15:05,592 --> 02:15:09,922
你以为他们都知道我们的难处吗?
Do you think they have any concept of our problems?

1674
02:15:13,934 --> 02:15:16,057
我对你说什么好呢?
What can I say to you?

1675
02:15:17,479 --> 02:15:20,516
说什么才能让你明白呢?
What can I say to you to make you see?

1676
02:15:27,156 --> 02:15:30,276
你什么都不用说了
There is nothing you can say.

1677
02:15:32,077 --> 02:15:33,073
不用了
Nothing.

1678
02:15:33,203 --> 02:15:36,407
(radio) Nothing has happened to alleviate the crisis.

1679
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:38,616
The crisis reached a head this afternoon

1680
02:15:38,751 --> 02:15:42,285
when all rail travel between western zones and Berlin was stopped.

1681
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:45,588
The blockade by land is now complete.

1682
02:15:46,759 --> 02:15:49,000
(music starts)

1683
02:15:52,222 --> 02:15:55,923
接下来我们要怎么做，将军? 撤消?
What do you think we're going to do, General? Withdraw?

1684
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:58,681
不能， 如果我们在压力下撤消,
We can't. If we withdraw under pressure,

1685
02:15:58,812 --> 02:16:01,220
我们在全世界的威望都要受到影响.
our prestige all over the world is threatened.

1686
02:16:01,357 --> 02:16:03,729
共产分子也会大量泳入.
The Communists will move in on every front.

1687
02:16:03,859 --> 02:16:09,316
这些审判如何呢，将军? 你感觉如何呢?
What about these trials, General? How do you feel about them now?

1688
02:16:09,448 --> 02:16:11,820
我们要对审判负责,
We're committed to the trials,

1689
02:16:11,951 --> 02:16:15,818
但现实一点的做法是我们要加快审判进度.
but I think it would be realistic to accelerate them as much as possible.

1690
02:16:15,955 --> 02:16:19,537
如果他们向我们进攻时我们采取什么措施，将军?
What would happen if they fired on one of our planes, General?

1691
02:16:19,667 --> 02:16:24,163
到时我们自然要面对， 现在没有答案.
We'll have to face that when it happens. There is no other answer to that now.

1692
02:16:27,591 --> 02:16:30,261
你应该尝尝这里的甜点， 很出名的.
You should try the strudel. It's excellent here.

1693
02:16:30,386 --> 02:16:32,378
不，谢谢
No, thanks.

1694
02:16:32,513 --> 02:16:36,641
丹, 我刚从柏林回来你知道的
Dan, I've just come back from Berlin, as you know.

1695
02:16:36,767 --> 02:16:41,180
我想本来不该是这样的， 我也不知道.
I don't think this is going to be it. A lot of people do, but I don't.

1696
02:16:41,313 --> 02:16:47,186
但可以肯定的是这是场斗争， 为将来的10年或20年.
But it is going to be a fight for survival  for the next ten years, maybe the next 20.

1697
02:16:47,319 --> 02:16:49,644
德国是能否幸存的关键.
Germany is the key to that survival.

1698
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:54,359
高校学地理的同学就可以告诉你.
Any high-school student in geography can tell you that.

1699
02:16:54,493 --> 02:16:57,280
参议员，你到底想说什么?
Just what are you trying to say, Senator?

1700
02:16:57,413 --> 02:16:59,820
我要说的是:
What I'm trying to say is this:

1701
02:16:59,957 --> 02:17:03,622
没人想左右你的想法,
while nobody's trying to influence your decision,

1702
02:17:03,752 --> 02:17:07,750
意识到这个很重要 这是生活的真谛.
it's important that you realise this because it's a fact of life.

1703
02:17:07,881 --> 02:17:12,378
我们来面对吧，这是不详之兆啊.
Let's face it, gentlemen, the handwriting is on the wall.

1704
02:17:12,511 --> 02:17:14,967
我们要团结所有力量.
We're going to need all the help we can get.

1705
02:17:15,097 --> 02:17:19,593
我们需要德国人民的支持.
We're going to need the support of the German people.

1706
02:17:19,727 --> 02:17:21,968
还要甜点吗，先生们?
More strudel, gentlemen?

1707
02:17:26,191 --> 02:17:28,647
欧内·姜宁, 你可以开始了.
Herr Janning, you may proceed.

1708
02:17:33,699 --> 02:17:37,613
我想要证实一下费尔德斯特的案子
I wish to testify about the Feldenstein case

1709
02:17:38,829 --> 02:17:43,989
因为这是当时期最典型的案子.
because it was the most significant trial of the period.

1710
02:17:44,126 --> 02:17:49,417
法官席不仅要明白,
It is important not only for the tribunal to understand it,

1711
02:17:49,548 --> 02:17:52,300
对于全德国人民也是一样必要明白.
but for the whole German people.

1712
02:17:53,177 --> 02:17:55,715
为了可以理解它,
But in order to understand it,

1713
02:17:55,930 --> 02:18:00,473
必须要知道当时的时代背景.
one must understand the period in which it happened.

1714
02:18:01,518 --> 02:18:04,223
狂热恶疾覆盖了大地.
There was a fever over the land.

1715
02:18:04,355 --> 02:18:08,933
耻辱、污蔑、饥饿的恶疾.
A fever of disgrace, of indignity, of hunger.

1716
02:18:10,110 --> 02:18:12,684
我们有民主，是的,
We had a democracy, yes,

1717
02:18:12,821 --> 02:18:15,775
但已经在心底撕碎了.
but it was torn by elements within.

1718
02:18:16,408 --> 02:18:20,027
最重要的，还是恐惧.
Above all, there was fear.

1719
02:18:20,162 --> 02:18:23,863
害怕今天，明天
Fear of today, fear of tomorrow,

1720
02:18:23,999 --> 02:18:26,075
害怕我们的邻邦,
fear of our neighbours,

1721
02:18:26,210 --> 02:18:29,045
害怕我们自己.
and fear of ourselves.

1722
02:18:30,422 --> 02:18:32,913
只有当你理解
Only when you understand that

1723
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:36,466
你才会明白西特勒对我们有多重要.
can you understand what Hitler meant to us.

1724
02:18:36,595 --> 02:18:38,635
因为他对我们说:
Because he said to us:

1725
02:18:40,015 --> 02:18:44,309
"抬起你的头， 以身为德国人而骄傲吧."
"Lift your heads. Be proud to be German."

1726
02:18:44,436 --> 02:18:49,431
"我们身边充斥了魔鬼  共产党, 自由主义者, 犹太人，吉普赛人."
"There are devils among us  communists, liberals, Jews, Gypsies."

1727
02:18:49,566 --> 02:18:55,854
"一旦魔鬼被消灭， 你们的烦恼也就解决了."
"Once these devils will be destroyed, your misery will be destroyed."

1728
02:18:55,990 --> 02:19:00,948
这是“牺牲品”的遥远传说.
It was the old, old story of the sacrificial lamb.

1729
02:19:04,999 --> 02:19:07,406
知道更多些的我们又怎么样呢?
What about those of us who knew better?

1730
02:19:07,543 --> 02:19:11,837
我们知道的只是谎言?
We who knew the words were lies and worse than lies?

1731
02:19:11,964 --> 02:19:16,044
我们为什么要沉默? 我们为什么要参加?
Why did we sit silent? Why did we take part?

1732
02:19:17,595 --> 02:19:20,132
因为我们爱我们的国家.
Because we loved our country.

1733
02:19:21,348 --> 02:19:26,556
极少数政治极端分子失势有什么区别?
What difference does it make if a few political extremists lose their rights?

1734
02:19:26,687 --> 02:19:31,230
少数民族失去权利又有何用?
What difference does it make if a few racial minorities lose their rights?

1735
02:19:31,358 --> 02:19:33,434
这都是必经阶段.
It is only a passing phase.

1736
02:19:33,569 --> 02:19:35,941
这是我们必须要走的路
It is only a stage we are going through.

1737
02:19:36,071 --> 02:19:38,313
不久这就将被抛弃
It will be discarded sooner or later.

1738
02:19:38,449 --> 02:19:42,778
西特勒不久也要被抛弃
Hitler himself will be discarded sooner or later.

1739
02:19:42,995 --> 02:19:46,198
"国家身处危险之中， 我们要大步走出阴影"
"The country is in danger! We will march out of the shadows."

1740
02:19:46,332 --> 02:19:51,077
"我们要前进" “前进”是很好的一个字眼
"We will go forward." "Forward" is the great password.

1741
02:19:53,881 --> 02:19:58,590
法官大人，历史也证实了
And history tells how well we succeeded, Your Honour.

1742
02:19:59,929 --> 02:20:03,344
我们成就了伟大的理想.
We succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.

1743
02:20:03,474 --> 02:20:08,895
西特勒鼓吹的权利和憎恨弥漫着德国,
The very elements of hate and power about Hitler that mesmerised Germany,

1744
02:20:09,021 --> 02:20:11,227
弥漫着全世界!
mesmerised the world!

1745
02:20:11,357 --> 02:20:14,939
我们发现竟然有如此强大的同盟.
We found ourselves with sudden powerful allies.

1746
02:20:15,069 --> 02:20:20,490
民主似乎在向我们招手.
Things that had been denied to us as a democracy were open to us now.

1747
02:20:20,616 --> 02:20:25,194
全世界都在说 "向前吧！拿去吧!"
The world said "Go ahead. Take it. Take it!"

1748
02:20:25,329 --> 02:20:29,196
"拿下苏台德区 拿下莱茵河."
"Take Sudetenland. Take the Rhineland. Remilitarise it."

1749
02:20:29,333 --> 02:20:31,788
"拿下整个奥地利."
"Take all of Austria! Take it."

1750
02:20:35,005 --> 02:20:38,754
然后有一天我们回头看看
And then one day we looked around

1751
02:20:38,884 --> 02:20:42,502
才发现我们更危险了.
and found that we were in an even more terrible danger.

1752
02:20:42,638 --> 02:20:45,010
仪式就在这法庭上展开,
The ritual began in this courtroom,

1753
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:49,683
迅速蔓延全国!
swept over the land like a raging, roaring disease!

1754
02:20:49,812 --> 02:20:53,394
什么是必经之路
What was going to be a passing phase

1755
02:20:55,067 --> 02:20:57,309
已经成了生活的习惯
had become the way of life.

1756
02:21:02,866 --> 02:21:04,906
法官大人,
Your Honour,

1757
02:21:06,287 --> 02:21:11,363
我很满足可以静静地听审.
I was content to sit silent during this trial.

1758
02:21:12,668 --> 02:21:16,500
我很满足这样的看护.
I was content to tend my roses.

1759
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:25,621
我很满足有辩护律师来拯救我的声誉...
I was even content to let counsel try to save my name...

1760
02:21:25,681 --> 02:21:29,892
until I realised that in order to save it

1761
02:21:30,978 --> 02:21:34,477
但我意识到死灰复燃.
he would have to raise the spectre again.

1762
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:39,023
你们都已经见到了.
You have seen him do it.

1763
02:21:39,153 --> 02:21:42,070
他已经在庭上这么做了.
He has done it here in this courtroom.

1764
02:21:42,197 --> 02:21:47,214
他暗示第三帝国 为人民服务.
He has suggested that the Third Reich worked for the benefit of people.

1765
02:21:47,244 --> 02:21:52,701
他暗示西特勒统治下的德国为人民服务.
He has suggested that we sterilised men for the welfare of the country.

1766
02:21:52,833 --> 02:21:59,714
他暗示那个老犹太人是同16岁女孩发生了关系.
He suggested that perhaps the old Jew did sleep with the 1 6-year-old girl after all.

1767
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:06,803
再次，这是为了国家利益.
Once more, it is being done for love of country.

1768
02:22:09,433 --> 02:22:13,561
要说出事实不容易
It is not easy to tell the truth.

1769
02:22:15,314 --> 02:22:19,477
但只要有拯救德国的办法
But if there is to be any salvation for Germany,

1770
02:22:19,610 --> 02:22:23,358
如果我们有罪就要承认,
we who know our guilt must admit it,

1771
02:22:23,489 --> 02:22:28,364
不管疼痛和羞辱.
whatever the pain and humiliation.

1772
02:22:34,124 --> 02:22:39,830
在我进入法庭之前，
I had reached my verdict on the Feldenstein case

1773
02:22:39,964 --> 02:22:42,501
在Feldenstein一案中我已经收到了陪审团的结果
before I ever came into the courtroom.

1774
02:22:42,633 --> 02:22:47,129
不管证据如何他都是有罪的， 这案子没有意义.
I would have found him guilty whatever the evidence. It was not a trial at all.

1775
02:22:47,263 --> 02:22:52,221
这是个“牺牲仪式”, 可怜的犹太人费尔德斯特是无辜的牺牲者.
It was a sacrificial ritual, and Feldenstein the Jew was the helpless victim.

1776
02:22:52,351 --> 02:22:56,894
法官大人， 被告不知道他在说什么.
Your Honour, the defendant is not aware of what he is saying.

1777
02:22:57,022 --> 02:22:59,062
他不知道其中的暗示.
He is not aware of the implications.

1778
02:22:59,191 --> 02:23:01,860
我知道，我知道!
I am aware. I am aware!

1779
02:23:03,779 --> 02:23:06,235
我的律师让你们相信
My counsel would have you believe

1780
02:23:06,365 --> 02:23:10,445
我们不知道集中营的事情.
we were not aware of the concentration camps.

1781
02:23:10,577 --> 02:23:13,115
不知道
Not aware.

1782
02:23:13,247 --> 02:23:15,074
我们当时在哪?
Where were we?

1783
02:23:15,207 --> 02:23:19,075
西特勒在国会宣泄愤怒时，我们在哪?
Where were we when Hitler began shrieking his hate in the Reichstag?

1784
02:23:19,211 --> 02:23:23,588
当我们的邻居们被抓去达靠，我们在哪?
When our neighbours were dragged out in the middle of the night to Dachau?

1785
02:23:23,716 --> 02:23:27,085
当每个村庄都有了铁路站台，我们在哪？
Where were we when every village in Germany has a railroad terminal

1786
02:23:27,219 --> 02:23:32,842
牛车上载满了孩子们时，
where cattle cars were filled with children being carried off to their extermination?

1787
02:23:32,975 --> 02:23:36,059
他们向我们哭叫，我们又在哪?
Where were we when they cried out in the night to us?

1788
02:23:36,186 --> 02:23:39,390
我们瞎了？哑了？聋了？
Were we deaf? Dumb? Blind?

1789
02:23:39,523 --> 02:23:41,432
法官大人，我要抗议
Your Honour, I must protest.

1790
02:23:41,567 --> 02:23:47,154
我的辩护律师辩护说， 我们不知道百万人灭绝的事情.
My counsel says we were not aware of the extermination of the millions.

1791
02:23:47,281 --> 02:23:49,570
还给你们找了借口
He would give you the excuse

1792
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:54,528
我们似乎只知道数百人的灭绝.
we were only aware of the extermination of the hundreds.

1793
02:23:55,331 --> 02:23:58,497
这样就可以减轻罪孽吗?
Does that make us any the less guilty?

1794
02:23:59,918 --> 02:24:02,410
或许我们不知道细节,
Maybe we didn't know the details,

1795
02:24:02,546 --> 02:24:07,291
但如果我们不知道， 那也是因为我们不想知道
but if we didn't know, it was because we didn't want to know.

1796
02:24:07,426 --> 02:24:11,506
 叛国者! 叛国者!  遵守秩序
 Traitor! Traitor!  Order. Order.

1797
02:24:12,097 --> 02:24:14,055
遵守秩序!
Order!

1798
02:24:14,183 --> 02:24:17,468
把人带下， 到原来的位置.
Put that man back in his seat and keep him there.

1799
02:24:21,565 --> 02:24:24,317
我要告诉他们真相.
I am going to tell them the truth.

1800
02:24:25,235 --> 02:24:30,859
如果全世界都反对， 那我就说出真相.
I am going to tell them the truth if the whole world conspires against it.

1801
02:24:30,991 --> 02:24:36,578
我要告诉他们有关司法行政部的真相.
I am going to tell them the truth about their Ministry of Justice.

1802
02:24:38,165 --> 02:24:43,123
沃纳·兰谱, 现在在祈祷的人.
Werner Lampe, an old man who cries into his Bible now.

1803
02:24:43,754 --> 02:24:46,889
从每个被他送往集中营的人中
An old man who profited by the property expropriation

1804
02:24:46,924 --> 02:24:50,589
征收财产收益
of every man he sent to a concentration camp.

1805
02:24:50,719 --> 02:24:55,962
弗里德·霍夫斯特, 一个良好国民， 知道如何执行命令
Friedrich Hofstetter, the good German, who knew how to take orders,

1806
02:24:56,100 --> 02:25:01,342
把很多人送上了监狱.
who sent men before him to be sterilised, like so many digits.

1807
02:25:03,482 --> 02:25:05,973
爱米尔·哈恩,
Emil Hahn,

1808
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:09,146
腐败、堕落的家伙
the decayed, corrupt bigot,

1809
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:12,446
将自己的灵魂出卖给了魔鬼.
obsessed by the evil within himself.

1810
02:25:17,663 --> 02:25:19,702
还有欧内斯特·姜宁,
And Ernst Janning,

1811
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:23,992
比他们都要坏...
worse than any of them...

1812
02:25:24,837 --> 02:25:28,003
因为他知道真相,
because he knew what they were,

1813
02:25:28,132 --> 02:25:30,457
但是还和他们狼狈为奸
and he went along with them.

1814
02:25:33,512 --> 02:25:37,592
欧内斯特·姜宁...
Ernst Janning, who made his life...

1815
02:25:40,102 --> 02:25:42,142
他的生活简直就是垃圾...
excrement...

1816
02:25:43,939 --> 02:25:46,395
因为他同他们一样同流合污.
because he walked with them.

1817
02:27:12,695 --> 02:27:14,734
法官大人,
Your Honour,

1818
02:27:16,073 --> 02:27:20,865
为欧内斯特·姜宁辩护是我的责任,
it is my duty to defend Ernst Janning,

1819
02:27:21,954 --> 02:27:26,283
虽然欧内斯特·姜宁 说他自己有罪.
and yet Ernst Janning has said he is guilty.

1820
02:27:26,417 --> 02:27:30,580
毫无疑问他有罪恶感.
There is no doubt he feels his guilt.

1821
02:27:32,298 --> 02:27:36,924
他在纳粹的行动中犯了错误,
He made a great error in going along with the Nazi movement,

1822
02:27:37,553 --> 02:27:40,637
但初衷却是为了国家利益.
hoping it would be good for his country.

1823
02:27:40,764 --> 02:27:44,679
但如果他被定有罪,
But, if he is to be found guilty,

1824
02:27:45,894 --> 02:27:50,141
还有其他追随者,
there are others who also went along,

1825
02:27:51,233 --> 02:27:53,771
也要被定有罪.
who also must be found guilty.

1826
02:27:55,571 --> 02:28:00,945
欧内斯特·姜宁说"我们成就了伟大的理想".
Ernst Janning said "We succeeded beyond our wildest dreams".

1827
02:28:02,953 --> 02:28:06,536
我们为什么会成功呢。法官大人?
Why did we succeed, Your Honour?

1828
02:28:08,292 --> 02:28:11,044
其他国家表现如何呢?
What about the rest of the world?

1829
02:28:12,546 --> 02:28:16,710
难道他们不知道第三帝国的决心?
Did it not know the intentions of the Third Reich?

1830
02:28:16,842 --> 02:28:21,718
他们没有听到西特勒的演说吗?
Did it not hear the words of Hitler broadcast all over the world?

1831
02:28:21,847 --> 02:28:24,255
难道他们不知道他对畿辅的意图吗,
Did it not read his intentions in Mein Kampfl,

1832
02:28:24,391 --> 02:28:27,595
全世界都发表了?
published in every corner of the world?

1833
02:28:28,228 --> 02:28:31,514
那么苏联的责任在哪,
Where is the responsibility of the Soviet Union,

1834
02:28:31,649 --> 02:28:37,734
在1939年签定和约， 发生了战争?
who signed in 1 939 the pact with Hitler that enabled him to make war?

1835
02:28:39,031 --> 02:28:41,783
现在要定俄国有罪吗?
Are we now to find Russia guilty?

1836
02:28:43,035 --> 02:28:46,404
1933年，同西特勒签定宗教协议的梵蒂冈
Where is the responsibility of the Vatican,

1837
02:28:46,538 --> 02:28:49,990
使得西特勒获得巨大声望
who signed in 1 933 the concordat with Hitler,

1838
02:28:50,125 --> 02:28:53,826
那它的责任又在哪?
giving him his first tremendous prestige?

1839
02:28:54,588 --> 02:28:57,755
难道我们现在说梵蒂冈有罪?
Are we now to find the Vatican guilty?

1840
02:28:59,093 --> 02:29:02,426
世界领袖之一， 丘吉尔的责任又在哪里,
Where is the responsibility of the world leader Winston Churchill,

1841
02:29:02,554 --> 02:29:06,338
在1938年伦敦时报发表的
who said in an open letter to the London Times in 1 938 -

1842
02:29:06,475 --> 02:29:10,010
1938, 法官大人
1 938, Your Honour -

1843
02:29:11,105 --> 02:29:14,474
"如果英国也遭受这样的灾难，
"Were England to suffer national disaster, I should pray to God

1844
02:29:14,608 --> 02:29:19,104
那就派遣阿道夫·西特勒来拯救吧."
to send a man of the strength of mind and will of an Adolf Hitler."

1845
02:29:19,238 --> 02:29:22,405
难道我们现在说丘吉尔有罪?
Are we now to find Winston Churchill guilty?

1846
02:29:22,533 --> 02:29:25,866
帮助西特勒制造武器的美国军火家们
Where is the responsibility of those American industrialists

1847
02:29:25,995 --> 02:29:28,664
从中收益
who helped Hitler to rebuild his armaments,

1848
02:29:28,789 --> 02:29:32,075
他们的责任又在哪里?
and profited by that rebuilding?

1849
02:29:32,209 --> 02:29:35,376
难道我们现在说美国的军火商有罪?
Are we now to find the American industrialists guilty?

1850
02:29:35,504 --> 02:29:37,995
不，法官大人
No, Your Honour. No.

1851
02:29:39,091 --> 02:29:41,131
不是单单德国有罪
Germany alone is not guilty.

1852
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:44,925
全世界也像德国一样需要对西特勒负责.
The whole world is as responsible for Hitler as Germany.

1853
02:29:45,055 --> 02:29:47,973
审判处罚一个人很容易.
It is an easy thing to condemn one man in the dock.

1854
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:51,959
可以简单说一些缺陷成就西特勒
It is easy to speak of the "basic flaw" in the German character

1855
02:29:51,979 --> 02:29:54,018
that allowed Hitler to rise to power,

1856
02:29:54,148 --> 02:29:57,351
同时又忽略了缺陷本身
and at the same time ignore the "basic flaw" of character

1857
02:29:57,484 --> 02:30:01,316
使得俄国签定协定， 丘吉尔称赞,
that made the Russians sign pacts with him, Winston Churchill praise him,

1858
02:30:01,447 --> 02:30:04,946
美国军火商收益!
American industrialists profit by him!

1859
02:30:07,870 --> 02:30:11,321
欧内斯特·姜宁说他有罪
Ernst Janning said he is guilty.

1860
02:30:13,375 --> 02:30:19,330
如果他是， 那么欧内斯特·姜宁的罪就是全世界的罪
If he is, Ernst Janning's guilt is the world's guilt.

1861
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:24,384
不多不少如此
No more and no less.

1862
02:30:38,025 --> 02:30:43,529
将军， 我们要给予军事政府力所能及的帮助.
Major, we have to give the military governor every help we can give him.

1863
02:30:43,656 --> 02:30:46,822
每天要保证700吨的空中物资支援.
We have to get 700 tons in the air a day.

1864
02:30:46,951 --> 02:30:48,990
700吨
700 tons.

1865
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,539
这是操作的问题.
This is some operation.

1866
02:30:58,879 --> 02:31:04,668
你有没有想过我们要支援煤和西红柿?
Did you ever think we'd be flying coal and tomatoes in these crates?

1867
02:31:06,845 --> 02:31:10,511
泰德, 我们已经是老朋友了
Tad, you and l have been friends a long time.

1868
02:31:10,641 --> 02:31:13,096
所以我叫你到这来
That's why I called you here.

1869
02:31:16,021 --> 02:31:19,853
明天在法庭你要怎么做?
What are you going to do in court tomorrow?

1870
02:31:22,111 --> 02:31:24,732
你很清楚我要怎么做吗
You know damn well what I'm going to do.

1871
02:31:25,281 --> 02:31:30,488
我知道你要把他们锁起来， 丢掉钥匙.
I know what you want to do  put them behind bars and throw away the key.

1872
02:31:30,619 --> 02:31:33,490
你知道这里发生了什么?
You know what's going on here now?

1873
02:31:34,707 --> 02:31:38,372
是，我知道
Yeah, I know what's going on.

1874
02:31:38,502 --> 02:31:41,207
你是军人， 你知道我们反对什么.
You're an army man. You know what we're up against.

1875
02:31:41,338 --> 02:31:45,170
其他人或许不知道， 但我要告诉你
The others may not, but you do. I'll tell you the truth.

1876
02:31:45,301 --> 02:31:50,009
我不知道如果他们向飞机攻击的话， 会发生什么事情.
I don't know what's going to happen if they fire on one of those planes.

1877
02:31:50,139 --> 02:31:52,630
我不知道会发生什么
I don't know what's going to happen.

1878
02:31:52,766 --> 02:31:57,345
但我知道: 如果通过柏林，就通过德国
But if I do know this: if Berlin goes, Germany goes.

1879
02:31:57,479 --> 02:32:00,848
通过德国，就通过欧洲
If Germany goes, Europe goes.

1880
02:32:01,692 --> 02:32:06,270
这就是原则.
That's the way things stand. That's the way they stand.

1881
02:32:06,405 --> 02:32:09,904
听着, Matt. 我的忍耐到极限了
Look, Matt. I'm going to go the limit.

1882
02:32:10,034 --> 02:32:13,367
我不是神...
And not you, not the Pentagon, not God on his throne is...

1883
02:32:13,495 --> 02:32:16,449
你以为你在跟谁说话?
Who do you think you're talking to?

1884
02:32:17,916 --> 02:32:20,704
你到底以为你在同谁说话?
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

1885
02:32:20,836 --> 02:32:23,837
当你到达靠时我也在
When you were marching into Dachau, I was there too.

1886
02:32:23,964 --> 02:32:26,455
你以为我会忘记吗?
You think I'll ever forget it?

1887
02:32:27,509 --> 02:32:31,638
我不是你的指挥官， 也不会影响你的决定.
I'm not your commanding officer. I can't and won't influence your decision.

1888
02:32:31,764 --> 02:32:36,426
但我要告诉你, 直接让你明白.
But I want to give this to you, and I want to give it to you straight.

1889
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:39,727
我们需要德国人民的支持.
We need the help of the German people.

1890
02:32:41,649 --> 02:32:47,817
把他们领导关押了并不能获得德国的帮助.
You don't get their help by sentencing their leaders to stiff prison sentences.

1891
02:32:58,916 --> 02:33:03,245
Tad, 现在要做的是如何幸存，不是吗?
Tad, the thing to do is survive, isn't it?

1892
02:33:04,296 --> 02:33:08,508
以最好的方式幸存不是吗.
Survive as best we can, but survive.

1893
02:33:18,269 --> 02:33:20,475
笑笑吧,
Just for laughs, Matt.

1894
02:33:21,438 --> 02:33:24,060
战争的意义到底是什么?
What was the war all about?

1895
02:33:25,693 --> 02:33:27,732
有什么意义?
What was it about?

1896
02:33:33,909 --> 02:33:40,614
这些都是针对被告的书面证据
That concludes presentation of documentary evidence against these defendants.

1897
02:33:49,425 --> 02:33:51,464
法官大人,
Your Honours,

1898
02:33:52,553 --> 02:33:56,764
战后三年的欧洲,
during the three years that have passed since the end of the war in Europe,

1899
02:33:57,641 --> 02:34:01,888
人类并没有获得太平.
mankind has not crossed over into Jordan.

1900
02:34:02,813 --> 02:34:06,312
在我们的国家， 战争的恐惧再次苏醒
In our own country, fear of war has been revived

1901
02:34:06,442 --> 02:34:10,024
我们要再次审视被告.
and we must look once more to our defences.

1902
02:34:10,946 --> 02:34:16,189
有冷战的说法， 女人和孩子死于非真正的战争,
There's talk of cold war while men and women die in real wars,

1903
02:34:17,077 --> 02:34:25,085
迫害和暴行不会真正消寂.
and the echoes of persecution and atrocities will not be stilled.

1904
02:34:27,713 --> 02:34:34,166
这些虽然没有帮助， 却还是值得留意.
These events cannot help but colour what happens in this courtroom.

1905
02:34:34,303 --> 02:34:38,003
但在这些事件中,
But somewhere in the midst of these events,

1906
02:34:38,974 --> 02:34:45,593
我们在庭上审理的犯罪事实
the responsibility for the crimes that we brought forward during this trial

1907
02:34:45,731 --> 02:34:50,192
必须从正确的角度来审视
must be placed in true perspective.

1908
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:56,571
这是你现在要面临的问题， 法官大人
And this is the decision that faces Your Honours.

1909
02:34:56,700 --> 02:35:01,916
这是我们进退两难的时候.
It is the dilemma of our times.

1910
02:35:01,956 --> 02:35:07,709
It is a dilemma that rests with you.

1911
02:35:14,426 --> 02:35:16,466
公诉完毕.
The prosecution rests.

1912
02:35:37,866 --> 02:35:41,911
被告可以做最后陈词了.
The defendants may now make their final statements.

1913
02:35:46,333 --> 02:35:50,331
被告爱米尔·哈恩 可以陈词了.
Defendant Emil Hahn may address the tribunal.

1914
02:35:55,342 --> 02:36:00,585
法官大人, 我不会逃避我的责任
Your Honours, I do not evade the responsibility for my actions.

1915
02:36:01,432 --> 02:36:06,259
相反的，我会向全世界承认它们.
On the contrary, I stand by them before the entire world.

1916
02:36:07,146 --> 02:36:10,728
但我不会遵循别人的政策.
But I will not follow the policy of others.

1917
02:36:11,567 --> 02:36:14,236
我不会昨天说我们的政策对了
I will not say of our policy today that it was wrong

1918
02:36:14,361 --> 02:36:17,695
然后说我们今天的政策错了
when yesterday I say it was right.

1919
02:36:17,823 --> 02:36:20,528
德国在为生存而挣扎
Germany was fighting for its life.

1920
02:36:20,659 --> 02:36:23,862
出于自卫，某些政策是需要的.
Certain measures were needed to protect it from its enemies.

1921
02:36:23,996 --> 02:36:27,116
我不能说我这么做错了.
I cannot say that I am sorry we applied those measures.

1922
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:30,585
我们是对抗布尔什维克的壁垒.
We were a bulwark against Bolshevism.

1923
02:36:30,711 --> 02:36:34,376
我们是西方文化的基石.
We were a pillar of Western culture.

1924
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:39,301
壁垒和基石是西方都需要保存的.
A bulwark and a pillar the West may yet wish to retain.

1925
02:36:43,641 --> 02:36:49,227
被告弗里德·霍夫斯特 可以陈词了.
The defendant Friedrich Hofstetter may address the tribunal.

1926
02:36:55,486 --> 02:36:59,353
我终生都为国效忠,
I have served my country throughout my life,

1927
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:02,028
不管我被分配到了哪里,
and in whatever position I was assigned to,

1928
02:37:02,159 --> 02:37:06,904
只是尽忠职守.
in faithfulness, with a pure heart and without malice.

1929
02:37:07,873 --> 02:37:13,116
我心中只有一个信念,
I followed the concept that I believed to be the highest in my profession,

1930
02:37:13,253 --> 02:37:15,330
信念就是:
the concept that says:

1931
02:37:15,464 --> 02:37:21,752
牺牲小我的正义， 服从法律,
to sacrifice one's own sense of justice to the authoritative legal order,

1932
02:37:21,887 --> 02:37:24,639
只遵守法律,
to ask only what the law is,

1933
02:37:25,516 --> 02:37:28,552
不要询问法律是否正义.
and not to ask whether or not it is also justice.

1934
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:33,387
做为执法者，我只能如此.
As a judge, I could do no other.

1935
02:37:33,524 --> 02:37:37,818
我相信法官大人明白的，
I believe Your Honours will find me, and millions of Germans like me,

1936
02:37:37,945 --> 02:37:41,112
很多德国人像我一样,
who believed they were doing their duty to their country,

1937
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:44,407
认为他们只是效忠，无罪
to be not guilty.

1938
02:37:49,415 --> 02:37:52,700
被告沃纳·兰谱 可以陈词了
The defendant Werner Lampe may address the tribunal.

1939
02:38:00,801 --> 02:38:02,841
法官大人...
Your Honours...

1940
02:38:14,064 --> 02:38:16,104
法官大人...
Your Honours...

1941
02:38:34,543 --> 02:38:37,793
被告欧内斯特·姜宁 可以陈词了.
The defendant Ernst Janning may address the tribunal.

1942
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:51,509
我没有什么好多说了.
I have nothing to add to what I have said.

1943
02:39:02,321 --> 02:39:05,856
证词收集完毕, 法庭辩论也结束了.
Testimony has been received, final arguments have been heard.

1944
02:39:05,991 --> 02:39:11,745
审判程序结束， 但是法官席需要时间考虑.
There remains nothing now but the task of the tribunal to render its decision.

1945
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:15,917
法官席考虑到发布告示为止
The tribunal will recess until further notification.

1946
02:39:37,064 --> 02:39:39,522
我已经根据国内法和国际法
I've collected precedents and arguments

1947
02:39:39,566 --> 02:39:41,892
that have a bearing on the basis of the case,

1948
02:39:41,927 --> 02:39:46,210
引用收集和案件相关的争论的焦点
which is the conflict between allegiance to international law

1949
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:49,241
and to the laws of one's own country.

1950
02:39:49,368 --> 02:39:53,864
丹, 我们有一大堆资料要看
Dan, we have a mountain of material to go over here.

1951
02:39:53,998 --> 02:39:56,204
 你在看什么呢, 丹?  恩?
 What are you looking at, Dan?  Mm?

1952
02:39:56,333 --> 02:40:01,920
我在看一些逮捕证的照片.
I was looking at some of these pictures attached to the warrants for arrest.

1953
02:40:02,047 --> 02:40:04,087
什么照片?
What pictures?

1954
02:40:05,342 --> 02:40:09,174
这是皮特斯.
There's Petersen before they operated on him.

1955
02:40:09,305 --> 02:40:11,297
这是爱琳·霍夫曼.
Here's lrene Hoffman.

1956
02:40:11,432 --> 02:40:14,386
当时她只有16岁不是吗?
She really was 1 6 once, wasn't she?

1957
02:40:15,769 --> 02:40:17,809
费尔德斯特
Feldenstein.

1958
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:24,851
这个孩子，多少也不过14岁
And here's a boy  he certainly couldn't have been more than 1 4 -

1959
02:40:24,987 --> 02:40:28,071
被捕是因为说了不忠帝国的话.
executed for saying things against the Third Reich.

1960
02:40:28,198 --> 02:40:31,899
"根据弗里德·霍夫斯特法官命令执行."
"By order of Justice Friedrich Hofstetter."

1961
02:40:32,036 --> 02:40:36,448
对了，还有更多相关资料,
If I may say so, more pertinent to the legal basis of the case,

1962
02:40:36,582 --> 02:40:39,014
我有法国检举人给军事法庭的意见
I have the address of the French prosecutor

1963
02:40:39,084 --> 02:40:41,706
before the international military tribunal.

1964
02:40:41,837 --> 02:40:45,509
很显然，对于命令的直接执行者
"lt is obvious that, in the state organised along modern lines,

1965
02:40:45,549 --> 02:40:49,926
他们是有责任的
responsibility is confined to those who act directly for the state."

1966
02:40:50,054 --> 02:40:53,968
"尽管他们只是发布命令,
"Since they alone are in a position to judge the legitimacy of the given orders,

1967
02:40:54,099 --> 02:40:56,555
但一样会被检举."
they alone can be prosecuted."

1968
02:40:56,685 --> 02:40:59,307
我还有里斯教授的意见 -
I have another from Professor Jahreiss -

1969
02:40:59,438 --> 02:41:02,937
"法律角度: 主要战犯的审理".
"Legal aspects: trial of the major war criminals".

1970
02:41:03,067 --> 02:41:06,270
根据这些，
On the basis of these, I don't see where the prosecution

1971
02:41:06,403 --> 02:41:09,523
我真的不清楚检举人针对被告什么
has put forth a really clear-cut case against the defence

1972
02:41:09,657 --> 02:41:12,148
pertaining to the charges in the indictment.

1973
02:41:12,284 --> 02:41:16,412
考虑效忠以外的因素,
Regardless of the acts committed, we cannot make the interpretation

1974
02:41:16,538 --> 02:41:23,158
我们无法解释他们是否需要对行为负责.
that these defendants are really responsible for crimes against humanity.

1975
02:41:23,963 --> 02:41:27,462
 你在想什么呢, 丹?  我们已经讨论了一整天了!
 What do you think, Dan?  We've been going over this all day!

1976
02:41:27,591 --> 02:41:29,631
如果现在还不清楚...
If it isn't clear now...

1977
02:41:31,095 --> 02:41:34,131
难道你不来看看吗?
Aren't you going to look at these precedents?

1978
02:41:34,265 --> 02:41:36,802
你一点都不感兴趣吗?
Aren't you interested at all?

1979
02:41:38,811 --> 02:41:43,888
我很感兴趣. 你在说人性犯罪,
I'm interested, Curtiss. You were speaking of crimes against humanity,

1980
02:41:44,024 --> 02:41:47,358
被告们无须为他们的行为负责.
saying the defendants were not responsible for their acts.

1981
02:41:47,486 --> 02:41:50,522
我希望你可以解释给我听.
I'd like you to explain that to me.

1982
02:41:50,656 --> 02:41:53,657
 我刚才就在解释.  也许.
 I've just been explaining it.  Maybe.

1983
02:41:53,784 --> 02:41:59,205
但我听到的都是一些含糊的法律条规的说法.
But all I've heard is a lot of legalistic double talk and rationalisation.

1984
02:41:59,331 --> 02:42:02,914
你知道， 当我初次成为法官
You know, when I first became a judge

1985
02:42:03,043 --> 02:42:06,744
我知道我就要避免接触一些人.
I knew there were certain people in town I wasn't supposed to touch.

1986
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:11,009
这是法官的中立性决定的.
I knew that if I was to remain a judge, this was so.

1987
02:42:12,011 --> 02:42:14,965
但你要我从另外一个角度怎么看
But how in God's name do you expect me to look the other way

1988
02:42:15,097 --> 02:42:16,924
谋杀6，000，000人?
at the murder of six million people?

1989
02:42:17,057 --> 02:42:20,592
 我知道不是...  我不是让你换个角度.
 I'm sure he didn't mean...  I'm not asking you to look the other way.

1990
02:42:20,728 --> 02:42:25,057
我是问你如何更好的顺应政策?
I'm asking you what good is it going to do to pursue this policy?

1991
02:42:27,693 --> 02:42:32,189
你说他们无罪.
Curtiss, you were saying that the men are not responsible for their acts.

1992
02:42:32,323 --> 02:42:34,564
你需要做出解释.
You're going to have to explain that to me.

1993
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:37,654
而且要解释的很清楚.
You're going to have to explain it very carefully.

1994
02:42:45,294 --> 02:42:47,203
法官出席
The tribunal is now in session.

1995
02:42:47,338 --> 02:42:53,340
上帝保佑美国及检举人.
God bless the United States of America and this honourable tribunal.

1996
02:43:12,321 --> 02:43:15,690
在历经8个月的审判.
The trial conducted before this tribunal began over eight months ago.

1997
02:43:15,824 --> 02:43:19,988
有10,000 多页的证据记录,
The record of evidence is more than 1 0,000 pages long,

1998
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:24,663
总结了辩护律师的最后陈述.
and final arguments of counsel have been concluded.

1999
02:43:26,210 --> 02:43:29,460
残酷的谋杀和暴行
Simple murders and atrocities

2000
02:43:29,588 --> 02:43:34,250
与本案无关
do not constitute the gravamen of the charges in this indictment.

2001
02:43:34,385 --> 02:43:39,723
正确的说
Rather, the charge is that of conscious participation

2002
02:43:39,848 --> 02:43:45,638
这样的罪行是全局的责任,
in a nationwide, government-organised system of cruelty and injustice,

2003
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:53,230
in violation of every moral and legal principle known to all civilised nations.

2004
02:43:54,196 --> 02:43:58,408
法官席认真考虑过
The tribunal has carefully studied the record

2005
02:43:58,534 --> 02:44:03,030
参考了足够的证据
and found therein abundant evidence

2006
02:44:03,163 --> 02:44:09,581
对被告的起诉内容表示怀疑.
to support beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against these defendants.

2007
02:44:09,712 --> 02:44:11,751
(murmuring)

2008
02:44:20,973 --> 02:44:25,849
罗尔福, 在他有利的辩护中,
Herr Rolfe, in his very skilful defence,

2009
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:31,559
宣称有其他
has asserted that there are others

2010
02:44:31,609 --> 02:44:34,526
需要承担责任的组织
who must share the ultimate responsibility

2011
02:44:34,653 --> 02:44:37,191
for what happened here in Germany.

2012
02:44:37,323 --> 02:44:39,362
这是事实
There is truth in this.

2013
02:44:40,534 --> 02:44:46,786
抱怨的政党在这里受到公开审判.
The real complaining party at the bar in this courtroom is civilisation.

2014
02:44:48,375 --> 02:44:56,548
但主谋负责人更要负责
But the tribunal does say that the men in the dock are responsible for their actions.

2015
02:44:58,385 --> 02:45:02,050
穿上法官袍的人
Men who sat in black robes,

2016
02:45:03,557 --> 02:45:06,428
审判着其他人.
in judgment on other men.

2017
02:45:08,646 --> 02:45:15,147
参与法律制定的人,
Men who took part in the enactment of laws and decrees,

2018
02:45:18,113 --> 02:45:22,325
目的却是要毁灭全人类.
the purpose of which was the extermination of human beings.

2019
02:45:22,451 --> 02:45:25,613
执法者
Men who, in executive positions,

2020
02:45:25,663 --> 02:45:30,740
更是参与行动，
actively participated in the enforcement of these laws,

2021
02:45:30,876 --> 02:45:34,079
违法的执行
illegal even under German law.

2022
02:45:40,344 --> 02:45:49,801
各国刑法共有这样的通则：
The principle of criminal law in every civilised society has this in common:

2023
02:45:51,313 --> 02:45:56,652
任何人唆使他人犯罪,
any person who sways another to commit murder,

2024
02:45:58,153 --> 02:46:04,571
任何人提供武器犯罪,
any person who furnishes the lethal weapon for the purpose of the crime,

2025
02:46:05,828 --> 02:46:09,528
任何人作为犯罪环节之一,
any person who is an accessory to the crime,

2026
02:46:11,292 --> 02:46:13,331
都归属有罪.
is guilty.

2027
02:46:17,548 --> 02:46:23,716
罗尔福另外指出
Herr Rolfe further asserts that the defendant Janning

2028
02:46:25,598 --> 02:46:27,804
姜宁是一名特殊的法官
was an extraordinary jurist

2029
02:46:27,933 --> 02:46:31,385
他做着效忠国家的事情
and acted in what he thought was the best interest of his country.

2030
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,845
的确是事实
There is truth in this also.

2031
02:46:35,899 --> 02:46:40,443
姜宁, 是个悲剧人物
Janning, to be sure, is a tragic figure.

2032
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:44,612
我们相信他憎恨邪恶
We believe he loathed the evil he did.

2033
02:46:44,742 --> 02:46:50,534
但是对他灵魂的怜悯
But compassion for the present torture of his soul must not beget forgetfulness

2034
02:46:50,664 --> 02:46:57,118
不能同他参与的罪行混淆
of the torture and the death of millions by the government of which he was part.

2035
02:46:57,254 --> 02:47:01,312
姜宁的一生在法庭上
Janning's record and his fate illuminate the most shattering truth

2036
02:47:01,342 --> 02:47:03,630
得到了回顾
that has emerged from this trial.

2037
02:47:03,761 --> 02:47:09,099
如果他及同其他被告因此被降级
If he, and all of the other defendants, had been degraded perverts,

2038
02:47:09,224 --> 02:47:15,512
或者第三帝国的领导者们都是恶魔,
if all of the leaders of the Third Reich had been sadistic monsters and maniacs,

2039
02:47:15,648 --> 02:47:19,728
那么自然就没有什么道德可言
then these events would have no more moral significance

2040
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:23,443
than an earthquake, or any other natural catastrophe.

2041
02:47:23,572 --> 02:47:29,693
但审判中可以看出
But this trial has shown that under a national crisis

2042
02:47:29,828 --> 02:47:34,656
在那样的环境,
ordinary, even able and extraordinary men,

2043
02:47:34,792 --> 02:47:38,706
人人会犯罪也不奇怪
can delude themselves into the commission of crimes

2044
02:47:38,837 --> 02:47:42,123
想象一下
so vast and heinous that they beggar the imagination.

2045
02:47:42,257 --> 02:47:45,508
人们都不会忘记
No one who has sat through the trial can ever forget them.

2046
02:47:46,929 --> 02:47:50,547
人的扭曲仅因为政治
Men sterilised because of political belief.

2047
02:47:50,683 --> 02:47:53,968
背叛友谊和忠诚.
A mockery made of friendship and faith.

2048
02:47:54,103 --> 02:47:56,142
谋杀孩子
The murder of children.

2049
02:47:57,356 --> 02:47:59,479
都可以轻易的发生
How easily it can happen.

2050
02:48:01,318 --> 02:48:03,477
在我们的国家也都有
There are those in our own country too

2051
02:48:03,612 --> 02:48:08,321
尽管说着维护国家利益.
who today speak of the protection of country, of survival.

2052
02:48:08,450 --> 02:48:11,784
一切都是如此.
A decision must be made in the life of every nation.

2053
02:48:11,912 --> 02:48:15,992
在拼死相搏时,
At the very moment when the grasp of the enemy is at its throat,

2054
02:48:16,125 --> 02:48:20,098
最好的方法就是借刀杀人,
then it seems that the only way to survive is to use the means of the enemy,

2055
02:48:20,129 --> 02:48:22,798
to rest survival upon what is expedient,

2056
02:48:22,923 --> 02:48:25,212
to look the other way.

2057
02:48:26,218 --> 02:48:32,351
Well, the answer to that is... survival as what?

2058
02:48:32,391 --> 02:48:34,680
但国家不是岩石
A country isn't a rock.

2059
02:48:34,810 --> 02:48:37,431
国家不是个人的
It's not an extension of one's self.

2060
02:48:37,563 --> 02:48:39,686
它有它自己的利益
It's what it stands for.

2061
02:48:39,815 --> 02:48:46,233
国家在困难时更难维持.
It's what it stands for when standing for something is the most difficult.

2062
02:48:48,365 --> 02:48:51,283
面对全世界人民
Before the people of the world,

2063
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:58,373
让我们坚守我们的誓言:
Iet it now be noted that here, in our decision, this is what we stand for:

2064
02:48:59,460 --> 02:49:02,129
正义、真相...
justice, truth...

2065
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:08,007
还有人权的价值.
and the value of a single human being.

2066
02:49:18,771 --> 02:49:22,389
法庭对被告哈恩做出判决
The marshal will produce before the tribunal the defendant Hahn.

2067
02:49:25,319 --> 02:49:27,442
爱米尔·哈恩,
Emil Hahn,

2068
02:49:27,571 --> 02:49:32,198
本席判你有罪，终身监禁.
the tribunal finds you guilty and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2069
02:49:32,326 --> 02:49:37,700
今天你判决我， 明天布尔什维克就判决你!
Today you sentence me. Tomorrow the Bolsheviks sentence you!

2070
02:49:42,711 --> 02:49:49,461
法庭对被告霍夫斯特做出判决
The marshal will produce the defendant Hofstetter before the tribunal.

2071
02:49:50,427 --> 02:49:52,467
弗里德·霍夫斯特,
Friedrich Hofstetter,

2072
02:49:52,596 --> 02:49:58,681
本席判你有罪，终身监禁.
the tribunal finds you guilty and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2073
02:50:01,647 --> 02:50:07,436
法庭对被告兰谱做出判决
The marshal will produce the defendant Lampe before the tribunal.

2074
02:50:11,865 --> 02:50:13,905
沃纳·兰谱,
Werner Lampe,

2075
02:50:15,202 --> 02:50:21,287
本席判你有罪，终身监禁.
the tribunal finds you guilty and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2076
02:50:22,501 --> 02:50:24,541
(murmuring)

2077
02:50:25,921 --> 02:50:27,961
(strikes gavel)

2078
02:50:30,759 --> 02:50:35,386
法庭对被告欧内斯特·姜宁做出判决
The marshal will produce the defendant Ernst Janning before the tribunal.

2079
02:50:50,821 --> 02:50:52,861
欧内斯特·姜宁,
Ernst Janning,

2080
02:50:54,116 --> 02:50:59,703
本席判你有罪，终身监禁.
the tribunal finds you guilty and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2081
02:51:05,461 --> 02:51:07,500
他不明白
He doesn't understand.

2082
02:51:08,672 --> 02:51:11,128
他就是不明白
He just doesn't understand.

2083
02:51:11,842 --> 02:51:13,882
他知道
He understands.

2084
02:51:17,348 --> 02:51:19,387
(strikes gavel)

2085
02:51:27,399 --> 02:51:32,066
Justice lves dissenting.

2086
02:51:32,112 --> 02:51:37,866
我要说明我的不同意见
I wish to point out strongly my dissenting vote from the decision of this tribunal

2087
02:51:37,993 --> 02:51:43,829
像同海伍德和诺里斯法官所说的一样
as stated by Justice Haywood, and in which Justice Norris concurred.

2088
02:51:43,958 --> 02:51:46,912
被告们的所作所为,
The issue of the actions of the defendants,

2089
02:51:47,044 --> 02:51:51,207
自认为是效忠国家,
who believed they were acting in the best interests of their country,

2090
02:51:51,340 --> 02:51:56,631
这不是法庭可以审判的.
is an issue that cannot be decided in a courtroom alone.

2091
02:51:56,762 --> 02:52:00,012
只能客观的评价,
It can only be decided objectively,

2092
02:52:00,140 --> 02:52:04,683
让历史来验证.
in years to come, in the true perspective of history.

2093
02:52:11,735 --> 02:52:14,357
法官大人， 书放在哪里?
Where shall I put these books, Your Honour?

2094
02:52:14,488 --> 02:52:17,655
放在箱子里吧.
Put them in the trunk, Mr Halbestadt.

2095
02:52:19,743 --> 02:52:24,073
法官大人，这是给你路上吃的.
Your Honour, here's something for you to have on the plane.

2096
02:52:24,206 --> 02:52:28,998
你再给我吃的， 我都没地方放了.
Oh, no. If you give me any more food, I won't have any room for anything else.

2097
02:52:29,128 --> 02:52:31,416
但这些是甜点， 你喜欢的.
But it's strudel, the way you like it.

2098
02:52:31,547 --> 02:52:35,212
谢谢你的招待
 Thank you. Thank you for everything.  Ja, ja.

2099
02:52:35,342 --> 02:52:37,382
 我放到车上.  谢谢
 I'll put it in the car.  Thanks.

2100
02:52:37,511 --> 02:52:42,802
机票、护照免检 在机场查登机证.
Tickets, passport, immunisation. I'll have your boarding pass at the airport.

2101
02:52:42,933 --> 02:52:45,305
三点以前机场见.
See you there no later than three o'clock.

2102
02:52:45,436 --> 02:52:48,271
对了，帮我问候... 她叫什么名字?
Oh, and give my regards to Miss... what was her name?

2103
02:52:48,397 --> 02:52:50,722
斯德尔福·爱莎.
Scheffler. Elsa.

2104
02:52:50,858 --> 02:52:53,396
 那是你欠我的.  什么意思?
 That's one you owe me.  What do you mean?

2105
02:52:53,527 --> 02:52:58,569
美国人今天在纽伦堡很不受欢迎.
Americans aren't very popular in Nuremberg this morning.

2106
02:53:13,422 --> 02:53:15,462
(dials number)

2107
02:53:19,720 --> 02:53:21,759
(phone rings)

2108
02:53:46,330 --> 02:53:48,369
(ringing continues)

2109
02:53:58,008 --> 02:54:01,211
 下午好，法官大人  下午好
 Good afternoon, Your Honour.  Good afternoon.

2110
02:54:02,513 --> 02:54:07,139
我受当事人欧内斯特·姜宁来此.
I came here at the request of my client, Ernst Janning.

2111
02:54:08,852 --> 02:54:11,474
他希望见你
He wishes to see you.

2112
02:54:11,605 --> 02:54:14,476
我正要去机场.
I'm just leaving for the airport.

2113
02:54:15,693 --> 02:54:19,275
他说对他意义重大
He says it would mean a great deal to him.

2114
02:54:25,619 --> 02:54:29,534
你知道法本案子的判决结果了吗?

2115
02:54:29,665 --> 02:54:34,126
多数人无罪， 少数人被轻判.
Most of them were acquitted. The others received light sentences.

2116
02:54:34,253 --> 02:54:38,500
 今天判决的.  不，我不知道.
 The verdict came in today.  No, I hadn't heard.

2117
02:54:38,632 --> 02:54:41,170
我和你打赌
I will make you a wager.

2118
02:54:41,302 --> 02:54:43,757
我不打赌
I don't make wagers.

2119
02:54:43,887 --> 02:54:45,631
绅士的赌博

你特别擅长使用逻辑.

你暗示的可能会发生.

逻辑上，考虑我们所处的时代.
It is logical, in view of the times in which we live.

2125
02:55:15,127 --> 02:55:18,377
但光依靠逻辑是不对的
But to be logical is not to be right.

2126
02:55:18,505 --> 02:55:21,791
上帝也不是全能的.
And nothing on God's earth could ever make it right.

2127
02:55:32,728 --> 02:55:34,768

我想把它交给我可以信任的人,
I want to give them to someone I can trust,

2136

2137

谢谢

我会好好保管的

我知道审判给你带来的压力

2140

你会被舆论批评
You will be criticised greatly.

2141
02:56:41,964 --> 02:56:45,333
你的决定并不明智
Your decision will not be a popular one.

2142
02:56:47,261 --> 02:56:50,511
但如果对你有意义的话
But, if it means anything to you,

2143
02:56:50,639 --> 02:56:56,144
你获得了被判罪的我的尊重.
you have the respect of at least one of the men you convicted.

2144
02:56:56,270 --> 02:57:02,024
在判决中， 你的判决是正义的.
By all that is right in this world, your verdict was a just one.

2145
02:57:03,736 --> 02:57:05,775
谢谢
Thank you.

2146
02:57:07,281 --> 02:57:11,610
你在法庭上要说的.
What you said in the courtroom, it needed to be said.

2147
02:57:11,744 --> 02:57:13,368
海伍德法官...
Judge Haywood...

2148
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:19,079
我让你来的原因...
The reason I asked you to come...

2149
02:57:26,842 --> 02:57:31,385
那些上百万的人
Those people, those millions of people,

2150
02:57:33,557 --> 02:57:36,926
我从不知道会那样
I never knew it would come to that.

2151
02:57:37,061 --> 02:57:41,010
你一定要相信
You must believe it. You must believe it.

2152
02:57:44,276 --> 02:57:48,144
欧内斯特·姜宁, 你早就知道了
Herr Janning, it came to that

2153
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:53,072
当你第一次判处一个无辜的人有罪时.
the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.
