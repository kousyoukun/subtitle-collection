1
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,760
My God, protect us now.

2
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,479
It seems that you are receiving
the most blows to the shoulders and arms.

3
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,817
We see that it sticks not strong
with the left.

4
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:21,154
EL RASTRO DE UN SUAVE PERFUME

5
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,448
That afternoon, connect say that Perkins

6
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,118
She kissed the canvas in the
2nd round, counting up to 8.

7
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,873
We come to the end of the sixth round!

8
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,215
Did you pay the phone?

9
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,889
We need money.
Who will give it?

10
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,392
My House is paid.
Almost.

11
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,186
Qu  dices?
Esa casa no vale nada.

12
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,521
- Es buena.
- S , maravillosa.

13
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,192
- Me prometiste encontrarlo.
- Te dije que lo intentar a.

14
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,402
Quisiera librarme de ella.

15
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,154
Por qu  no
se la das a alguien?

16
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,656
Tendr amos que trasladar
la oficina a mi coche.

17
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,035
Hay sitio para el tel f.
y el contestador autom tico.

18
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,661
- Es una buena casa.
- No para dos.

19
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,079
Quiero deshacerme de ella.

20
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,708
La conexi n est  pagada,
podemos recibir mensajes.

21
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,545
Nosotros podemos
recibir llamadas,

22
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,758
y quieres decirme c mo haremos
para poder contestadas?

23
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,237
Tenemos una cita para ma ana.

24
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,448
Para hacer qu ?
- No es para hacer nada.

25
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,367
It's just a date.

26
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,369
Already.

27
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,872
- You can go t ,  no?
- Yes.

28
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,335
Well, I'm going to see
if I hold it strong.

29
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,508
Yes.

30
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,615
Remember the money
of Pittsburgh?

31
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,201
- The one who cheated us.
-The one who disappeared?

32
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,327
Yes.

33
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,704
Last night, Bernie and I
We were having dinner

34
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:21,084
and a guy who danced,
he fell right next to me.

35
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,714
Is the woman.
The woman of Burning.

36
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,342
He has given one to each
concealer of the city.

37
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,387
As business cards.
Try to sell our pasta.

38
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,478
Is it dangerous?

39
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,732
Do not.
For us.

40
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,620
Warn the boys.

41
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,882
Mr. Hickey
Mr. Boggs?

42
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,217
Hickey

43
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,804
Mr. Boggs does not
Does he meet with us?

44
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,807
He is in the office. What can we do?
Do for you, Mr. Rice?

45
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,768
- Leave me.
-But if you do not know how to sign.

46
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,520
Do not say nonsense.

47
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,488
Say?

48
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:32,948
Yes.

49
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,700
Clear.

50
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,743
Agree.

51
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,164
T  warn Monte,
We'll go find the fat one.

52
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,165
Voucher.

53
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,401
Can I call my mom?

54
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,819
Clear.

55
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:15,699
It must be done delicately.
I have not seen her for a long time.

56
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,578
Only find it.
It's the only thing he should do.

57
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,207
I do not want you to talk
with her, understood?

58
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,250
I could be scared.

59
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,962
Discretion

60
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,256
You know what I want to say.

61
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,927
Only find it
and tell it to you.

62
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,929
Exact.

63
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,443
- Jack.
- S ?

64
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,279
I'm going to take the GTO.
The special one.

65
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,825
Mount, the keys are
in the rearview mirror.

66
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,788
These things may take.

67
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,457
I hope it is not too much.

68
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,002
The question of money remains.

69
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,421
200 a day more expenses.

70
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,341
I see.
Helping the inflation.

71
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,096
It was a joke.

72
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,141
Very good, the service number
that collects my messages

73
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,185
is in one of those
pieces of paper.

74
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,730
Call when you have
something to say.

75
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,783
500 dollars
As an advance.

76
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,160
A test of confidence.

77
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,538
Is it enough?

78
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,001
I think I am, Mr. Rice.

79
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,840
Well, "arrivederci", Mr. Hickey.

80
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,763
Try not to burn yourself.

81
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,231
- We have work.
- What a joy.

82
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,115
- I hate to bother you.
-So dont do it.

83
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,075
Do you see this girl?

84
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,579
-What does he teach?
- It's our job.

85
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,290
- Mary Jane Bowen.
-S .

86
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:52,833
Tell me about it.

87
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,502
An individual named Rice
He wants us to find it.

88
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:56,670
For what?

89
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,298
- A romantic relationship.
- It seems that the march is going.

90
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,177
Yes, and do not make fun of him.
We have 500 bucks to account.

91
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,058
You think the money
Does it drive me crazy?

92
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,311
Farrow, Shaw ..
Who is this last?

93
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,356
Burning
I think he's Hispanic.

94
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,943
When she saw Rice
by last goes?

95
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,027
3 weeks ago.

96
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,072
I will see Farrow
and you're looking for Shaw.

97
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,408
They were friends, but Rice already
he does not want to know anything about them.

98
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,702
- He only wants Mary Jane.
- It's your money.

99
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,163
And a part
it's going to be for us

100
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,749
In case you speak
with any of those guys,

101
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,751
Rice does not want
his name is mentioned.

102
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,337
How is Nyona?

103
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,257
What Nyona?

104
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,246
Whatever it is, I do not want
I do not care what he does.

105
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,124
The blinds are down,
He has not gotten up yet.

106
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,002
Men are all the same.

107
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,679
Who is it?

108
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,390
I could start
saying hello".

109
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,516
Hi.

110
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,351
How is it
the public servant?

111
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,478
I'm in a hurry.
Who is it?

112
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,273
I think his name is Farrow.

113
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,401
-What were you doing here?
Following the trail to a girl.

114
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,111
He was a clue.

115
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,574
Looking at the mailbox,
I found Mr. Farrow

116
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,201
lived in apartment 1338 A.

117
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,413
So making use of m
special deduction capacity,

118
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,916
I headed up the stairs towards
the apartment 1338 A.

119
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,043
No jokes

120
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,797
Note for the mechanic:
delete the last observation of Hickey

121
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,092
and my comment.
Get to the point.

122
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,227
Is there something?

123
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,190
It's been a long time
Do not see Mary Jane, years.

124
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,817
They went out with some brothers
called Burning.

125
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,320
Mary Jane's boyfriend
went to the moneybag for robbery.

126
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,531
Go item. Tomorrow we will go
to see the other Mr. Burning.

127
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,991
- Yes.
- Voucher.

128
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,702
-What about Farrow?
- He has eaten p lvora.

129
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,373
-He's dead?
- Yes.

130
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,000
Are you going to tell me something about him?

131
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:50,464
Looking at the buzzer, I deduced that Farrow
lived in apartment 1338 A.

132
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,550
What happened?

133
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,385
They have loaded a guy.

134
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,095
-  Robbery?
- Not seem.

135
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,515
As soon as I opened
the door, they liquidated it.

136
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,017
-Who has the report?
-It's in your office.

137
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,312
Shaw writes the statement
of Hickey, the one who found it.

138
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,105
Who is Hickey?

139
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,358
I was in the Hollen section.

140
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,195
Hello!

141
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,992
It does not have any grace,
dammit!

142
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,537
Your sense of humor is pathetic.
Go to the horn!

143
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,790
How timely!
Give me a towel

144
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,642
Go, get out of here.
Wait in another room.

145
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:30,981
I almost had a heart attack.
Everything you do is very funny.

146
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,985
- It was just a form of ...
- Wait in another room.

147
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,991
Do you feel better?

148
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,955
What do you want?

149
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,582
Want to see you.

150
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:35,003
- For the first time in 3 weeks.
- I have been working.

151
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,004
In what?

152
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,716
Come on, honey,
tranquil zate, will you?

153
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,096
I do not like this, you go
As if you still lived in this house.

154
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,306
- Viv a.
- But not anymore.

155
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,809
Now you live somewhere else.

156
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,395
You threw me out
I had to find another site.

157
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,355
With all the drunks
from the city.

158
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,774
You will be very happy
the 2 in that place.

159
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,488
Look, I'm tired of this.
I can not take it anymore.

160
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,243
Do you want me to leave?

161
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,165
Yes.

162
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,417
Voucher.

163
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,926
I will give you another chance.

164
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,640
Not tonight
I have it free, do you understand?

165
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,517
Ah rrame the drama.

166
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,110
A woman called Fine Sopp.

167
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,446
Although he has been
inactive lately.

168
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,366
A man named Bledsoe.
That is a good possibility.

169
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,745
My old partner,
Clifton Farrow,

170
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,081
I found out that he has entered
in negotiations with that person,

171
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:54,374
that woman.

172
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,585
They must have
Be very careful with him.

173
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,545
- We have it.
-Are they all?

174
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,881
There are not too many people
on the West Coast

175
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,342
able to do
big transactions.

176
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,886
How much is it really about?

177
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,189
In any case, these are
those who traffic with currency,

178
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,900
or buy it in this area.

179
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:25,989
We have got four cats.
Chandler is going to kill me.

180
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,868
I could call those people
for you and suggest

181
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,120
that refuse to enter
in dealings with that woman.

182
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,165
Do you want to hang up?

183
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,841
And he has not heard
of Mary Jane Bowen?

184
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,219
No, not now.
I am sorry.

185
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,139
But if I do ...
Perd n

186
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,561
If I can be of any help ...

187
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,814
We have already entertained you
Pretty, sir ...

188
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,441
Good evening, Mr. Rice.

189
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,402
Thanks for your sincerity.

190
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,409
- Lie.
- I know.

191
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,536
For now it does not matter.

192
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,289
Take care of this.
Now, tonight.

193
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,003
- No no.
- If it's lost, tell me.

194
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,881
- I have to present a report.
- Here it is.

195
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,007
HERE,  ve?

196
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:33,218
A key is nothing more than
a key until it opens something.

197
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,804
I have to take it to me
a traffic test.

198
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,098
I'll give it back to you
this afternoon or tomorrow.

199
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,143
If there has been a misunderstanding,
and I hope that is all,

200
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,936
It is my responsibility to clarify it.

201
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,778
An amateur less to the sport.

202
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:45,267
She is a good woman, she is
A little confused, that's all.

203
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,270
When you leave the apartment,
Would you mind telling us?

204
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:50,564
I would like to take a look,
just in case.

205
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,442
We also have
work to do

206
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:54,735
Yes, it's fine.

207
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,820
Do not forget
to return the key.

208
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:06,079
I need a little more sugar.

209
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,918
Something new?

210
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,504
No, the? Florister? A is closed.

211
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,547
Give me a puppy with chili.

212
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,257
- Two.
- Three.

213
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,468
Let there be four
and two coca-tails.

214
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,512
Found this where Farrow.

215
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,683
And also this.

216
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,064
Caramba.

217
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,900
Sorry to have to return them.

218
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,571
Yes.
Let's call Rice first.

219
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,032
I've already done it.
Cancel the service this morning.

220
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,285
I paid the bill and it has not stopped
another number, so let's eat.

221
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,637
"Averiado".

222
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:15,190
- In the drain pipe.
- Yes, in the kitchen.

223
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:17,317
-Do you hear the names?
- Do not.

224
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:18,277
Hickey?

225
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,571
We can not do
all for you

226
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,740
-How did you get in?
- Walking.

227
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,117
The apt is sealed.

228
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,119
Stop bullshit
and thanks.

229
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,496
- We would have found it.
- Yes, from here to a month.

230
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:33,083
- We are giving you a hand.
- It's fine, you've touched me.

231
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,794
Check it
Come on, get going.

232
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:36,837
Voucher.

233
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,382
- Do it well, boys.
- Av sanos if something comes up.

234
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,261
-Do you make a copy of the note?
- It's in my pocket.

235
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,971
Papadakis will go
ahead in this.

236
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,431
Fucks me giving these guys nothing.

237
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,892
Yeah, but if we do not,
leave us without a license.

238
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,435
Only
we're looking for Mary Jane.

239
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,020
I know, but still ...

240
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:57,900
You have a visit

241
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:30,390
-What do you want?
- Se or Burning?

242
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:34,728
The same.

243
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,356
We are private detectives,
Mr. Burning.

244
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,734
It means they are not police.

245
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,945
We're looking for Mary Jane Bowen.

246
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,825
Say, have you seen her?

247
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,705
We only look for it.
Nothing happens.

248
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,000
I have not seen
for 5 years.

249
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,382
I only sell flowers.

250
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:22,025
We do not have Mary Jane,
nor client.

251
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,655
This is what you copied
of Farrow's note?

252
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,408
There are three names
and directions behind.

253
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,290
It seems that they are plotting something.

254
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,084
Let's check these signs.

255
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,435
Tell us, where are you?

256
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,770
Wait.

257
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,444
The apartment is rented to a
such Mary Florida, or Florera.

258
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,532
They have not seen it for a long time.
Fourth floor, in the background.

259
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:38,120
- You have used your persuasion.
- Yes, and fifty bucks.

260
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,249
The cops have been this afternoon.
No one.

261
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,293
Go back

262
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:45,419
Yes.

263
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,099
You have invested your money well.

264
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,310
If someone appears,
will warn us?

265
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,437
I hope so.
With fifty turkeys.

266
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,779
- There are not many clothes.
- I would not have money.

267
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,216
S ?

268
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,011
Yes thanks.

269
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,891
They are here.
There are three types.

270
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,244
Eh, be careful!

271
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,872
Dammit.

272
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:12,454
Frank, do you want to come already?

273
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,183
My God.

274
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:54,371
"In reference to your request
of identification with respect

275
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:59,835
to thousand-dollar bills, with
serial numbers L41405982 C

276
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,172
and L41405983 C,

277
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,049
The above mentioned has not been
recovered from the theft

278
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:09,511
to the City Bank
15-10-71 ".

279
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,906
- Good morning.
- Hi, pir mano.

280
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:33,118
-Is there something?
- A certified cane.

281
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,085
Is it good news?

282
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,755
Not precisely.

283
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,300
Rice has given us a ballot,
It has left us untouched.

284
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,645
There may be
found Mary Jane.

285
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,271
It do not says that.

286
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,899
I think he is afraid.

287
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,960
- I like your style.
-What else can we do?

288
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,130
Listen, I'm going
to see the florist again.

289
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,092
T  oc pate de Rice, to see
if you can locate him

290
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:06,003
Are you going to put it on?

291
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,028
To the.

292
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,448
Have you ever killed

293
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:40,162
in the U.S?

294
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:45,083
Because I know what you're thinking,
but I know those people,

295
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:47,461
better than yourself.

296
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,630
They are bullies, nothing more.

297
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,799
Neither questions, nor time
to ask, or to talk.

298
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,385
The cops are more predictable.

299
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,098
If you wear a revolver, you should be
ready to kill.

300
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,518
I tell you it's better to run.

301
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:08,857
Have you finished?

302
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:14,822
You want to tell him
Papadakis last night?

303
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:16,406
Good...

304
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,749
I like your style.

305
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,562
Have you located Papadakis?

306
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:50,607
Tell him to come back.
No, it's something important.

307
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:56,071
Bob, distribute this.

308
00:44:56,572 --> 00:44:58,824
Bring Al Hickey and Frank Boggs.

309
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,868
No, it's not an arrest.

310
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:22,973
What the hell is happening?

311
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:25,767
That money is red hot!
Stunning!

312
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,187
2 people killed,
another 6 in Pittsburgh.

313
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:31,064
Every time something happens,
you two are in the middle.

314
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,775
- I want to know everything.
- You'll stay af nico.

315
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:35,569
I warn you,
do not go for the branches.

316
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:37,863
Who goes by the branches?
We brought the money.

317
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,365
-What did you do there?
- Investigating a little.

318
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:43,702
- We have a license,  no?
- Yes, for now.

319
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:46,997
What did you need?

320
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,710
-What about the florist?
- It was a Rice track.

321
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:53,295
2 tracks,
2 dead men.

322
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:55,005
We live difficult times.

323
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,966
There is a lot of social agitation.
Have you found Rice?

324
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,719
- Not yet.
Wonderful.

325
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:03,972
-What's the matter with Pittsburgh?
-Last winter.

326
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:06,725
In the Federal Reserve Bank.
3 dead guards,

327
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,603
3 dead assailants,
the driver escaped with the money.

328
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,980
Big bills.
Almost four hundred thousand.

329
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,690
They riddled the driver.

330
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:16,109
They did not find the money
nor his companion.

331
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:19,446
-What was her name?
- We do not know.

332
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,826
Is reward offered?

333
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,833
Twenty-five thousand.

334
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,336
I want to review this.
From above.

335
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,964
If you need us ...

336
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,635
She can not
get rid of the pasta.

337
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,179
The bills
They're too big.

338
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,057
Do not worry about that.
Tomorrow we will go to the game.

339
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,309
Farrow was an intermediary.

340
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,896
She was trying to let go
that pasta under pressure.

341
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:56,233
I said that tomorrow we will go
to the match. Rel jate and enjoy.

342
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,861
-What a match?
- Rams and Falcons.

343
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,946
Your rugby-

344
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,365
I'm in favor of the Rams.

345
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:06,743
-  Was not everything sold?
- He is.

346
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,371
We have to look
to Mary Jane Bowen,

347
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:12,291
not a rugby player.
There are twenty-five thousand dollars.

348
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,294
How much do you want to bet?

349
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,507
To the Rams?

350
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:23,177
What a Mary Jane
is in the game.

351
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:02,192
I thought he would let himself be seen.
Go success.

352
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:05,154
Give me the envelope.

353
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,910
Farrow had the same written.

354
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:15,164
"Rams- Falcons
More 1 "

355
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,583
- In these seats.
-  More one what?

356
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,376
The person they expected.

357
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:23,797
More days?

358
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:27,593
Ma ana?

359
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:32,014
- I do not know.
-What will be the date?

360
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,185
The entrance is the key.

361
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,148
Time of the match,
these seats, more a day.

362
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,524
While.

363
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,072
Say?

364
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,744
God no. I do not want
talk, I want to sleep

365
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,373
You only remember my phone
at bedtime.

366
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,587
You had work in a party,
You could have taken me.

367
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:08,175
Of course, everything we have to do,
we can do it in the field.

368
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:44,211
Give it to me again.

369
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,013
It only takes two people
in a transaction.

370
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:57,266
Three is dangerous.
Why a third party?

371
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:01,353
-What is this?
- Nothing.

372
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:04,189
- It says "Edith."
- It has changed in number.

373
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,899
You have seen her again.

374
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:10,821
I stopped paying the pension
and it is without white. Need help.

375
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,825
What has become of the friend,
the one in the big house?

376
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:19,246
Whatever,
It has happened yesterday.

377
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:21,999
He was still there the night before last.

378
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,752
Maybe I found a bigger one.

379
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:27,921
A guy with
a bigger house

380
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:29,923
Do not.

381
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,971
He tried to go back to his old
I work, then he ech .

382
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,932
- I wonder why?
- It's fine.

383
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:46,356
Is it the only pot?
Voucher.

384
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,070
And this do not miss it.

385
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:02,873
What?

386
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,461
- My house was very small.
- I know, you told me.

387
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:58,924
Eh!

388
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:16,567
It's yours, Hickey!

389
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:36,767
How is it supposed to
are we going to explain this?

390
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,103
To the Rams?

391
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,481
To the cops.

392
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,485
I'll think of something.

393
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,631
- Thank you, sir.
- Good sound.

394
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,864
As soon as possible, thank you.

395
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:19,536
We have got one.

396
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,630
Did they take the girl?

397
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:33,342
She did not appear.

398
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:37,179
It was an enclosure.
The broker was loaded,

399
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:39,765
so we do not know with
Who was negotiating

400
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,520
I do not want him to run away.
Save this

401
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:46,021
Very good.

402
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:49,817
It's dirty,
but there is no alternative.

403
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,027
It belongs to us.

404
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,489
The first play was ours.

405
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:00,118
If I do not cling to principles,
I could not believe in anything.

406
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,079
Clear.

407
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,707
Boggs saw the note together
to telf. of Farrow.

408
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,751
We thought that he could
being Mary Jane,

409
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:09,795
that had been
cited with Farrow

410
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,588
Why did not you notify?

411
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:13,924
It was just an assumption.

412
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:16,134
How they discovered it
the thugs?

413
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,011
They forced Burning.

414
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,471
What is this?

415
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,765
You know
and we do not!

416
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:26,770
You call the stadium,
there is a shooting,

417
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,857
a man dies, there are cold cuts
All over Los Angeles!

418
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,317
And you are
in the front row!

419
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:35,404
You should have been there,
you had Farrow's note.

420
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:38,031
And what else?
You used us

421
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:40,659
- You know it.
-Do you accuse us?

422
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,955
- I would like it.
- If you played it again,

423
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:48,208
I warn you that I'm going
to make sweat blood.

424
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:50,586
Have you heard?

425
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,463
Yes, we have o dos.

426
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,427
If they find out about the hotel,
we are ready.

427
01:01:58,719 --> 01:01:59,344
Yes.

428
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,389
We have to find
That fox before them.

429
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:05,434
Shoes seller,
kitchen piche ...

430
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:09,396
There is a lot of work
for ambitious young people.

431
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,190
- You take it with laughter.
- Do not.

432
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,359
Let me see it, I want to
check the other two names.

433
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,778
Come on.

434
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:21,700
Billy Bledsoe, Elena Could
and one Mr. Leroy.

435
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:24,036
Name (s.
Only names.

436
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:25,996
We will look at the telephone guide.

437
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,081
We have to find
That fox

438
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,677
So, when you're older,
You will know many things.

439
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,263
In addition, what will you do?
the day when the boys

440
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,347
go back to school?

441
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:29,309
No, I do not need a secretary.

442
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,812
But if ever
I need it, you will be.

443
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:46,243
My name is Boggs.

444
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:50,247
I wish you can see Mrs. Could.
Elena Could.

445
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,332
Can you tell me what you want?

446
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:57,379
I want to talk about Farrow
and Mary Jane Bowen.

447
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,341
Do you mind waiting, please?

448
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:12,853
No, for that you have
that put a tooth underneath.

449
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,689
Sure, you have to
put a tooth underneath.

450
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:18,358
Everybody knows.
More teeth, more pasta.

451
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:22,821
You can take it out with a thread
or with a pair of pliers.

452
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,785
There's no need, honey.

453
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:32,789
I love you too, but
It's harder for me to say, you know.

454
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,000
Tell mam  to call me.

455
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,085
Yes, look good.

456
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,046
Ok, honey.

457
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:40,547
Adi s.

458
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:15,707
Say?

459
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:21,046
Over here, please.

460
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:25,903
Boggs?

461
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:29,114
What name is that, brother?

462
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:32,576
- Irland s.
- Caf  irland s?

463
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,830
- More or less.
- It's fine.

464
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:40,209
Lester, bring chairs.

465
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:50,219
Sit down

466
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:54,556
Come on, be comfortable.

467
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:00,229
What can I do for you?

468
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:08,028
- I'll tell you.
-Direct to the corner.

469
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:10,572
Okay?
Prepared?

470
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,074
Now.

471
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:15,035
- The girl wants to negotiate.
-When?

472
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:16,495
Tonight.

473
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:19,957
Warn the troop.

474
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:35,013
You take it very calmly.

475
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:37,808
Yes.
Is there something?

476
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:42,479
I have not found Bledsoe.

477
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:45,607
So I went to see
to Mr. Could.

478
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:48,527
What did he tell you?

479
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:53,365
A freak of
justice and equality.

480
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:56,702
No children, widow ...

481
01:07:57,578 --> 01:08:00,330
It's in the North,
trying to recover Alcatraz.

482
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:04,126
That costs a lot of money.

483
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:13,135
Keep Mr. Leroy
and a house full of people.

484
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:15,929
What does he do?

485
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:22,978
He is a leader for his people.

486
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:34,364
And where do you go
to those happy people?

487
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:42,873
In La Brea,
between Watts and Belair.

488
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:48,629
Leroy: bald, wears glasses
of sun to be at home.

489
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:52,382
-S .
-S .

490
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:57,012
A heavyweight
Superstar of the ghetto.

491
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:01,058
- So ...
- So nothing.

492
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:10,108
Farrow made a decoration
or something like that for Mrs. Could.

493
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:14,404
Nobody heard about Mary Jane.
We're fine.

494
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:18,450
We do not have anything.

495
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:22,162
No customer,
no suspects, no clues.

496
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:24,122
There are no clues, nothing.

497
01:09:24,665 --> 01:09:26,708
Why do not you know
Who has called?

498
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:31,171
-Who?
-Mary Jane

499
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,257
He wants to see us tonight.

500
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:36,093
She says she's scared
and wants to leave.

501
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:39,179
If we help her, we could
get the reward

502
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:42,474
- Damned if ...
- Exactly.

503
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:46,979
- Of course he lies.
-How did you know our number?

504
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:52,317
You can only know it by Rice,
so he already found it.

505
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:55,779
The black community does not try
become something different.

506
01:09:56,488 --> 01:10:01,451
In fact, it is still psychologically
white in his behavior.

507
01:10:01,952 --> 01:10:05,038
And for that, my leader,
our leader,

508
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:08,292
keep saying one
and again that black power

509
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,752
can not be jealous
of white power.

510
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,464
He has to be fed up with him.
I have to be ...

511
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:18,218
Remember, the fourth car will be
behind the door 32.

512
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:20,512
At the beginning of the eighth inning.

513
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:23,557
In the back seat.

514
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:28,228
Yes, she will be there.
In point, as they say.

515
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:31,857
Exact.

516
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:36,111
It has strained.

517
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:39,948
All your contacts have been
driven away by those stupid ones.

518
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:41,325
They are not stupid.

519
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:44,411
She will have to negotiate
at our price. Tonight.

520
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:48,582
I told you I would do it.
That bitch is desperate.

521
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:51,418
The desperate foxes
They are dangerous, brother.

522
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,463
Will work?
I'll send Phillippe.

523
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:56,632
Disguised.

524
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,855
We're here

525
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:34,062
Hey.

526
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:15,896
It's her.

527
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:31,954
Come on!

528
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:35,499
Hi.
Mary Jane?

529
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:45,759
Watch out.

530
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:09,867
Close the door!

531
01:14:13,537 --> 01:14:15,581
Shut the door, idiot!

532
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:48,113
Five hundred cars here
plasters bastards give him to mine.

533
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,325
Well, eye for an eye.

534
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,620
- Go with Mary Jane.
-What?

535
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:57,998
It's Bledsoe.
The one we did not find.

536
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:01,585
I need a rev lver
bigger I do not give one.

537
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:03,879
What are we going to say this time?

538
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,049
This time we need
a lawyer.

539
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:13,222
That bitch has played it for us.

540
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:23,732
S ?

541
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:30,030
Wait, wait a moment!
What are you talking about?

542
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:32,032
From Starsky and Hutch.

543
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:35,035
They just organized in the stadium
of the Dodgers. Another one dead.

544
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:37,788
We have got the money,
but not the girl.

545
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:39,373
The thugs have escaped.

546
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:40,749
And what excuse do they give?

547
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,085
They say the girl called them.

548
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:45,587
She said she would not appear
if he warned us

549
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:48,465
I want them made dust.

550
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:52,219
By concealment of evidence
and criminal behavior!

551
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,763
Mach cal the bones to both!

552
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:56,849
I'm going to call Sacramento
to denounce them!

553
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:59,726
They will take away the license,
I will tear them to pieces, lock them up!

554
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:13,198
They have some proof
so I can help them?

555
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:15,868
From what I've heard,
the thing has become ugly.

556
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:19,163
- Get the test.
-  May I get it?

557
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:20,706
How much do you have to pay him?

558
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:22,749
They caught you with
hands in the dough.

559
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:29,464
Move some threads.
Does not he have any cane?

560
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:31,884
I'm a lawyer.
Not a magician.

561
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:40,267
- We will have judgment.
- Unless the charges are dropped.

562
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:43,353
I do not know.

563
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:45,272
What?

564
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,067
It's time to leave.

565
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:51,945
Leave what?

566
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:54,490
There's nothing to do
in this profession, Frank.

567
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:57,117
Nowhere.
Has no sense.

568
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:58,494
He is right.

569
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:01,622
A private investigator
It is no longer what it was.

570
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:05,000
With the latest legislation of
Sacramento two years ago,

571
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,211
you are not more than
process meat.

572
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:12,508
It does not lead to anything.

573
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:17,429
Of course, he drives
Four hundred of the big ones.

574
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:26,480
Well, we have to
find that bitch.

575
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:46,894
They are putting you
against the wall.

576
01:18:49,146 --> 01:18:53,734
Yes. Well, this is called
"a strong offensive".

577
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:57,905
What are you going to do?

578
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:02,910
I will have to counterattack
and move on.

579
01:19:06,747 --> 01:19:08,707
I'll see you after work.

580
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,253
Are you coming?

581
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:18,133
I will wait for you.

582
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,844
Yes, that's fine.

583
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:23,514
Things are improving.

584
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,691
And you call them soldiers!
You call them soldiers!

585
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,026
They have failed!

586
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:40,614
Two cars to the fucking shit!
They have failed!

587
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:44,368
Eliminated by two handicapped people.
Tell me, how is it possible?

588
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:45,536
Show me!

589
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:47,496
I want to know why they failed!

590
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:50,833
What is it?
Stupidity?  cobard a?

591
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:08,475
Why the hell are you coming here?

592
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:11,311
For the music.

593
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:16,525
I think it
They have taken your beer.

594
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,155
Come on, I'm going to buy you a car.

595
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:27,411
First you were going to sell my house
and now you're going to buy me a car.

596
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:31,165
I'm going to buy you a car
if you forget the house

597
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:34,126
- It was a good house.
- Was.

598
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:36,420
It still is.

599
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:39,423
At least I do not know
It has fallen down a cliff.

600
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,259
Where are the papers
to be able to collect the insurance?

601
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,220
It's late, they've expired.

602
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:48,765
Timed out.
- Frank, Frank.

603
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:51,310
Listen out.

604
01:20:51,768 --> 01:20:55,397
Everyone in this city
wants to finish with us.

605
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:57,608
We can not go worse.

606
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:01,904
Frank, do not you understand?

607
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:07,826
We went out in all the newspapers.
They are going to bury us.

608
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:09,912
One way or another.

609
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,543
Yes, it is here.

610
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:22,800
Edith is here.

611
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,094
It will go up right away
and then we will go.

612
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,808
Did not she get thrown out of here?

613
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:33,185
Someone owed him a favor.

614
01:22:16,895 --> 01:22:18,272
Are you tough?

615
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:48,677
Thank you, Frank!

616
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,679
Muñerete

617
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:55,058
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

618
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:57,019
On the street.

619
01:22:57,436 --> 01:22:59,229
Mary Jane does not
he will call again.

620
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:01,106
Why would he do it?

621
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:06,069
The bosses and us
we press it.

622
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:09,656
He does not want to be near
if any of us dies.

623
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,825
Sacrificed two intermediaries.

624
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:15,037
That means he had found
someone to sell.

625
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:24,171
Mary Jane had a lot of deal
with the brother of the? florist

626
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:27,841
The one in prison.
I'll go tomorrow morning.

627
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:31,720
- You're still without a car.
- Ya, I'll find something.

628
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,140
What are you going to do?

629
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:37,017
I'll start with the beach house.

630
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:39,186
- The last assault.
- That's.

631
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,271
Are you okay?

632
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:32,948
-What is this?
- It's a bullet.

633
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:34,324
I'll take it.

634
01:26:29,231 --> 01:26:29,940
S ?

635
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:33,902
Listen, the thugs have entered
in my house. They have destroyed it.

636
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:35,821
Also go for yours.

637
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:42,870
They were not looking for anything.
Bad business

638
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:46,790
They have destroyed it
just to get revenge.

639
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:52,588
They have been here.

640
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:11,190
Damn fans.
In the middle of the night.

641
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:22,534
He has come.

642
01:27:25,162 --> 01:27:27,080
He says he wants to go home.

643
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:30,501
I think it is true.

644
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:35,506
But I also think that we
You owe a lot of interest.

645
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:38,050
I think he owes us a bonus.

646
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:02,324
We have to move forward in
the deal with Rice and the black man.

647
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:40,237
What are you doing here?

648
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:45,117
Nyona is not here!

649
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:47,661
She is dead.

650
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:49,204
And you know.

651
01:28:49,413 --> 01:28:51,415
I do not want to see you
around here never again.

652
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:53,792
You're a garbage!

653
01:28:58,589 --> 01:29:02,634
Two years ago that
you are rotten   Dead!

654
01:29:06,096 --> 01:29:11,185
I do not want to see your face ever!
Never again!

655
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,603
- Come on kid.
- Come on.

656
01:29:55,604 --> 01:29:58,357
- Come on, tell her.
- Come on, come on.

657
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:26,301
It has been missing!

658
01:30:33,725 --> 01:30:35,352
-  Is everything ready?
- Yes.

659
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:40,274
Well, I do not want
that there are more failures.

660
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,735
Agree.

661
01:30:55,205 --> 01:30:56,415
Are you okay?

662
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:05,883
Well, I've been in jail.
Burning came under the word.

663
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:10,804
Before yesterday a woman
He went to look for him.

664
01:31:11,847 --> 01:31:15,267
Firm :
Mary Florida Burning.

665
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:19,146
Wife.
Bingo.

666
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:28,197
I took his address
to the official.

667
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:31,366
So let's go.
Get up.

668
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:34,745
Get up.

669
01:31:38,832 --> 01:31:40,751
I know you want the thugs.

670
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:44,087
We will find the woman.
They will not be far away.

671
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:49,802
Damn, they're not coming here.

672
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:53,764
It is an occasion.

673
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:05,526
Our occasion.

674
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:28,799
Okay, you quit.
Great.

675
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:35,139
Sit and spin around here.

676
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:41,103
You have chosen a good place.

677
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:45,149
At least, here
we will not stay dry.

678
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:46,608
Bob.

679
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:51,864
Put me a drink, please.
I will accompany my friend.

680
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:14,761
Oh, Frank.

681
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:17,639
Frank, you can not
leave me in the lurch.

682
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:20,309
They are going to bury us.

683
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:25,147
Only because you can not
get out of your head

684
01:33:25,355 --> 01:33:27,816
to that stupid
and pitiful bitch.

685
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:42,122
And you're the one who says it.

686
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:49,338
You can stay here,
because I go for them.

687
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:52,132
I want twenty-five thousand.

688
01:34:24,289 --> 01:34:27,042
If you want, you can stay
ah  sitting forever.

689
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:32,631
But you can not make her come back.

690
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:35,884
To the,

691
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,266
the only thing you can do is

692
01:34:43,851 --> 01:34:45,644
Try to get over it.

693
01:34:49,523 --> 01:34:50,816
Try it.

694
01:34:56,071 --> 01:35:00,659
Now I'm going to go out there
and I'm going to catch them.

695
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:37,529
Tell me where you are.

696
01:35:37,863 --> 01:35:39,823
Tell me where you are
or I will kill you.

697
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:43,619
I will do it.

698
01:35:45,787 --> 01:35:48,582
Do not get depressed, because
you will not get anything.

699
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:51,460
It is very difficult to carry a l o

700
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,463
of four hundred thousand dollars
from prison.

701
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,924
You did very well.

702
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:01,011
You still have Mary Jane.

703
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:04,431
It must be a woman's devil.

704
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:08,310
I killed Farrow because
He wanted too much chop.

705
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:10,813
Represent the show
until you left.

706
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:13,440
He is a woman devil.

707
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:19,863
They will process you, but there is no evidence.
They do not want to get dirty.

708
01:36:21,907 --> 01:36:25,118
So maybe you're going home.

709
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:31,083
There are things that could
be much worse.

710
01:36:32,334 --> 01:36:33,460
Pi nsalo.

711
01:36:49,768 --> 01:36:51,728
Mr. Rice,
Greet Mr. Boggs.

712
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:55,149
Mr. Rice.

713
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:59,403
Mr. Leroy,
Greet Mr. Hickey.

714
01:37:02,614 --> 01:37:04,741
So he fell off the cliff.

715
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:07,369
A pity.

716
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,956
My partner has
a bargain for you.

717
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:14,293
Magnificent house,
great neighborhood.

718
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:17,588
Esc chenle.

719
01:37:19,047 --> 01:37:22,468
Do only what
Mr. Hickey tell you.

720
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:39,568
We are going to do everything as
It was planned, okay?

721
01:37:41,487 --> 01:37:44,323
- All right, Mr. Leroy?
- Agree.

722
01:38:10,224 --> 01:38:13,936
-Why is this place?
- We used to come here.

723
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:16,772
It's okay, come out and get ready.

724
01:38:17,064 --> 01:38:19,107
Make them know how
if everything went well.

725
01:38:26,073 --> 01:38:27,616
Take the bag.

726
01:48:23,545 --> 01:48:25,005
Nobody has shown up.

727
01:48:31,678 --> 01:48:33,180
Who cares?

728
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:41,522
Thank you.

729
01:48:43,649 --> 01:48:44,441
There is no need

730
01:48:45,067 --> 01:48:46,777
It still does not lead to anything.

731
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:51,949
I know, you already told me.
