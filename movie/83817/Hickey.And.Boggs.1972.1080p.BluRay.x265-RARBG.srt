1
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:54,650
马德·德·迪奥斯。
Madre de Dios.

2
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,202
现在就保护我们。
Protect us now.

3
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:36,154
莱尔德似乎在拿... ...大部分都打在他的肩膀和手肘上。
Laird seems to be taking... ... most of those blows on his shoulders and elbows.

4
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,974
珀金斯的左手好像有点动。
Perkins appears to be pulling his left a bit.

5
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:43,066
他的手可能在第二回合受伤了。
He just might have hurt that hand back in round two.

6
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:49,197
如果你来晚了，珀金斯在第二轮数到八的时候就倒下了。
If you joined us late, Perkins was down in round two for an eight count.

7
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,235
第六回合结束了。
And there's the end of round six.

8
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:03,948
你付电话费了吗?
Did you pay the phone?

9
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:07,985
我要借。
I gotta borrow.

10
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:10,349
反对什么?
Against what?

11
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:12,503
我的房子很干净。
Well, my house is clear.

12
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:13,654
几乎。
Almost.

13
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,822
没有机会。不是那栋房子。
No chance. Not that house.

14
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,415
这是一个好房子。这是一栋很棒的房子。
It's a good house. It's a terrific house.

15
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,107
你答应过我你会找到合适的人。
You promised me you'd find somebody.

16
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,560
我说我会试试。
I said I would try.

17
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:24,325
我得把那房子卖掉。
I gotta get rid of that house.

18
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,913
那你为什么不把它给别人呢?
Well, why don't you give it to somebody?

19
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:29,095
我试过了，那家伙说也许我可以把车扔进去。
I tried and the guy said maybe if I'd throw in my car.

20
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,654
准备好支付电话费或电话答录费了吗?
Had enough ready for the phone bill or the answering service?

21
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:33,659
这是一个好房子。但不是两者都有。
It's a good house. But not both.

22
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,320
我得把它处理掉，仅此而已。所以我付了服务费。
Gotta get rid of it, that's all. So I paid the service.

23
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:38,028
现在我们可以得到一条消息。
Now we can get a message.

24
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,180
来电仍然有效。
Incoming still works.

25
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,789
如果我们想喊出来呢?
What if we want to call out, you know?

26
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:46,693
回个信息什么的?
Return a message or something?

27
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,173
明天早上有个约会。
Got an appointment in the morning.

28
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,177
是关于什么的?
What's it about?

29
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,873
到目前为止还没有任何问题。只是个约会。
It's not about anything so far. Just an appointment.

30
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,718
嗯…你可以留着它，不是吗?
Well... You can keep it, can't you?

31
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,033
是的。
Yeah.

32
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,692
是的。
Yeah.

33
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,488
我想我今晚要去水槽里。
I'm going in the tank tonight, I think.

34
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,299
是的。
Yeah.

35
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,665
你知道匹兹堡的交易吗?
You know the Pittsburgh deal?

36
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,096
我们放在干文件里的那个?
The one we put in the dry file?

37
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,443
消失的那个?
The one that disappeared?

38
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:37,469
是的。
Yeah.

39
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:42,269
昨晚，我和伯尼在吃晚饭，一个男人跳着华尔兹走过来。
Well, last night, Bernie and I were having dinner, and a guy waltzes over to the table.

40
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:45,116
然后把这个扔到我腿上。
And drops this right in my lap.

41
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,277
是那个女人。
It's the woman.

42
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,637
Quemando的女人。
Quemando's woman.

43
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,621
她在镇上的每个围栏里都放了一个。
She's put one of those out to every fence in town.

44
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,073
就像电话卡。
Like calling cards.

45
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,043
她想把我们的面包卖出去。
She's trying to sell our bread.

46
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:03,615
没有错吧?
There's no mistake?

47
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,781
不。
No.

48
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,613
还没有。
Not yet.

49
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:20,567
我们找些士兵来。
Let's get some soldiers.

50
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,630
希基先生还是博格斯先生?
Mr. Hickey or Mr. Boggs?

51
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,265
吻痕。
Hickey.

52
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,053
博格斯先生不来了?
Mr. Boggs won't be joining us?

53
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:39,668
博格斯先生今天上午在办公室。
Mr. Boggs is in the office this morning.

54
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,223
有什么能帮你的，赖斯先生?
How can we help you, Mr. Rice?

55
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:54,751
你好。
Hello.

56
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:56,787

确定。

正确的。
Right.

59
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:04,054
不，你打给蒙特，然后我们去找肥仔。
No, you call Monte, then we'll get Fatboy.

60
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,253
正确的。
Right.

61
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:33,032
尼克?我可以打电话给我妈妈吗?
Nick? Can I call my Mom?

62
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,504
当然,亲爱的。
Sure, honey.

63
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,924
这件事应该做得很精细。
It ought to be delicately done.

64
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,579
我已经有一段时间没见到她了。
It's been some time since I've seen her.

65
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:43,892
只要找到她，就够了。
Just to find her, is all that's really necessary.

66
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:46,437
我不想让你联系她，明白吗?
I don't want you to contact her, you understand?

67
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:49,031
她可能会回避。
She might shy away.

68
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:52,648
自由裁量权。
Discretion.

69
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,298
我是说，你知道这类事情。
You know the sort of thing, I mean.

70
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,284
找到她在哪里，然后告诉你。
Just find out where she is and let you know.

71
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,427
精确。
Precisely.

72
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,337
杰克?
Jack?

73
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:15,400
是吗?
Yeah?

74
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,474
我要坐GTO;特殊的。
I'm taking the GTO; the special.

75
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,003
蒙特?
Monte?

76
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,587
钥匙在遮阳板上面。
The keys are atop the visor.

77
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,636
你知道这可能需要一些时间。
You understand this may take some time.

78
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:28,807
我相信不会太久。
Well, not too very long, I trust.

79
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,498
这就留下了钱的问题。
That leaves the question of money.

80
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:35,040
每天200英镑，外加费用。
Two hundred a day plus expenses.

81
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:36,298
我明白了。
I see.

82
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,134
为通货膨胀尽自己的一份力量。
Doing your bit for inflation.

83
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,998
那只是个玩笑。
It was just a joke.

84
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:44,753
很好。
Very well.

85
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:49,105
我的电话号码就在其中一张纸上。
My answering service number is on one of those pieces of paper.

86
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,524
有消息就打给我。
Call when you have something to report.

87
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,680
500美元。
Five hundred dollars.

88
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,574
作为预付款。
As an advance.

89
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,944
证明我的诚意。
A demonstration of my sincerity.

90
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:08,202
这就足够了吗?
Is that sufficient?

91
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,770
我想是的，赖斯先生。
I think so, Mr. Rice.

92
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:18,206
嗯…你好，希基先生。
Well... Arrivederci, Mr. Hickey.

93
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,188
我们会跟你聊的。
We'll be talking to you.

94
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:55,664
我们的工作。
We're working.

95
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:57,191
听你这么说我很高兴。
I'm glad to hear it.

96
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,388
我不想打扰你。
I hate to bother you.

97
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,815
没事，只是想休息一下。
It's all right, just wanted to take a minute.

98
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,892
看到这个女孩了吗?
See this girl?

99
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,874
什么，她放出去了吗?
What, does she put out?

100
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,187
她是来做生意的，笨蛋。
She's business, dummy.

101
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,866
玛丽·简... ...鲍尔。
Mary Jane... ...Bower.

102
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,892
是的。
Yeah.

103
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:16,936
跟我说说她吧。
Tell me about her.

104
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,732
有个叫赖斯的小甜嘴想让我们找到她。
Some little sweet lips by the name of Rice wants us to find her.

105
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:20,759
对什么?
What for?

106
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,328
浪漫的联系。
A romantic connection.

107
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,035
"甜唇"让人欲罢不能啊?
A switch-hitting Sweet Lips, huh?

108
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,767
好吧，别取笑客户。
Yeah, well don't make fun of the client.

109
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,545
我们要付5美元的定金。
We got a five bill retainer.

110
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:33,668
你觉得钱能让我神魂颠倒吗?
Do you think money turns my head around?

111
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,160
法罗，斯沃普，最后一个是什么?
Farrow, Swope and what's this last one?

112
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,235
凯》。我想那是西班牙语。
Kay Mundo. That's Spanish I think.

113
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,469
赖斯最后一次见到玛丽·简是什么时候?
When was the last time Rice saw Mary Jane?

114
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:25,696
三周前。
Three weeks ago.

115
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:28,216
我去见法罗。你去找蒂娜·斯沃普。
I'll see Farrow. You look up Tina Swope.

116
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,692
他们几年前是朋友。
They were friends a few years ago.

117
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:32,039
米饭不再喜欢它们了。
Rice don't like them anymore.

118
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:33,456
他只想要玛丽·简。
He just wants Mary Jane.

119
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,563
这是他的钱。
Well, it's his money.

120
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,906
是啊，有些是我们的。
Yeah, well some of it's gonna be ours.

121
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,823
听着，无论你什么时候跟这些火鸡说话，赖斯都不希望你提到他的名字。
Now, look, whenever you talk to any of these turkeys, Rice doesn't want you to mention his name.

122
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,367
Nyona怎么样?
How's Nyona?

123
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:46,167
Nyona谁?
Nyona who?

124
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,854
他们是可爱的。谢谢你！
They're lovely. Thank you.

125
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:00,153
不管是什么，我不想要，他也不想要。
Whatever it is, I don't want any, and neither does he.

126
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:03,184
他的墨镜还没戴上，他甚至还没醒。
His shades are still down, he isn't even awake yet.

127
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:05,387
你们这些骗子都一样。
You con-men are all alike.

128
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:58,101
他是谁?
Who is he?

129
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:00,542
你可以先说声"你好"
Well, you could start by saying "hello."

130
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:01,569
你好。
Hello.

131
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,342
公务员怎么样了?
How's the public servant?

132
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:04,657
我没有时间。
I don't have time.

133
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:05,683
他是谁?
Who is he?

134
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:08,273
我想他的名字是法罗。
I think his name is Farrow.

135
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,187
你在这里做什么?
What were you doing here?

136
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:11,431
跳过追踪女孩。
Skip tracing a girl.

137
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:12,458
他是个线索。
He's a lead.

138
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:19,687
通过查看邮箱，我确定法罗先生住在1338A公寓。
By checking the mailbox I determined that Mr. Farrow lived at Apartment 1338A.

139
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:26,260
因此，我运用了我不可思议的推理能力，走上楼梯来到了1338A公寓。
Therefore using my uncanny reasoning ability, I then proceeded up the stairs to Apartment 1338A.

140
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,799
别他妈开玩笑。
No goddamn jokes.

141
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:33,791
速记员注意，删掉希基的最后一句话和我的评论。
Note to stenographer, strike Hickey's last remark and my comment.

142
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:36,512
实话实说吧。
Just tell it straight.

143
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,162
什么吗?
Anything?

144
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,514
哦，蒂娜·斯沃普很久没见过玛丽·简了。年。
Oh, Tina Swope hadn't seen Mary Jane in a long time. Years.

145

00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,109
玛丽·简的男朋友因持械抢劫进了监狱。
Mary Jane's boyfriend went to the can for armed robbery.

147
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,928
这是一种艰难的赚钱方式。
A tough way to make a buck.

148
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,939
我们明天去见另一位奎曼多先生。
So we'll go see the other Mr. Quemando tomorrow.

149
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:00,965
是的。好吧。
Yeah. Okay.

150
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:02,087
法罗呢?
What about Farrow?

151
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,761
他被子弹夹住了。
He caught a bullet sandwich.

152
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,211
你说他死了是什么意思?是的，我找到他了。

你打算告诉我吗?
Were you gonna tell me about it?

发生了什么事?
What happened?

156
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,632
那家伙被炸飞了。抢劫吗?
Guy got blown up. Robbery?

157
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,242
看起来不像。
Doesn't look like it.

158
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,040
他只是开了门，收了钱。
He just opened up his door and got paid off.

159
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:24,492
谁拿了报纸?
Who's got the paper?

160
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,201
大部分都在你桌上。
Most of it's on your desk.

161
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,502
肖还有阿尔·希基的笔录。
Shaw's still got Al Hickey's transcript.

162
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,218
他找到了他。希是谁?

他以前在霍伦贝克分部工作。

嗨。
Hi.

165
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,741
这一点都不好笑，该死的。
That's not funny, goddamn it.

166
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,770
你的幽默感真可怜。
Your sense of humor is pathetic.

167
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:26,911
去你的。
God damn you.

168
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:30,729
别站在那儿，给我扔条毛巾。
Don't stand there, throw me a towel.

169
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,216
离开着。滚出去。

170
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,924
在另一个房间等着。
Wait in the other room.

171
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:51,999
我差点心脏病发作。
I almost had a heart attack.

172
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,699
你觉得你做的一切都很可爱。
You think everything you do is so cute.

173
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:59,119
这只是一种表达……在另一个房间等着。
It's just a way of saying... Just wait in the other room.

174
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:46,791
感觉好点了吗?
You feel better?

175
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,912
你想要什么?
What do you want?

176
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:54,477
我想见你。

00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:03,716
别这样，亲爱的，放松点，好吗?
Come on, honey, loosen up, will you?

181
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,305
听着，我真的不喜欢这样。
Now, look, I really don't like this.

182
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,344
你走进来就像你住在这里一样。
You walk in here like you live here.

183
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,052
嗯，我做了。现在不是了。

184
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,667
你现在住在考克斯曼天堂。

和镇上所有的妓女。

You and that fag partner, you must be very happy together.

188

听着，我真的很生气，你不会笑的。
Look, I'm really ticked off about this, and you're not gonna smile at it.

189
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,860

我再给你一次机会。

今晚不行。它不是免费的。

你必须去争取。
You've got to earn it.

195
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,838
省省吧。
Spare me the drama.

My former partner, Clifton Farrow, whom I know for a fact has been negotiating with this person, this woman.

你一定要小心他。
You must be very careful of him.

201
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:22,387
我们必须吗?大家都来了吗?

在西海岸，没有多少资源能够进行大规模的交易。

你没听说过玛丽·简·鲍尔吗?

直到现在还没有。我很抱歉。

217
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,221
还不重要。
Doesn't matter yet.

224
00:26:53,973 --> 00:26:57,031
钥匙就是钥匙，夫人，除非能打开什么东西，否则别无它用。
Well, a key is still a key, ma'am, and nothing else until it opens something.

我会进行常规的锁测试。

I'll have it back to you this afternoon, tomorrow at latest.

I'd like to look around, just on the off chance, you know, uh... We've got a job to do, too, okay?

00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:17,917
我们只是在找她。没有麻烦。
We're just looking for her. There's no trouble.

278
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,041
我有五年没见过她了，也许更久了。
I haven't seen her in five years, maybe more.

279
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:26,909
我只是卖花。
I just sell flowers.

280
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,758
看来我们没有玛丽·简，也没有客户。
Looks like we got no Mary Jane and no client.

281
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:50,651
这就是你从法罗的笔记上抄下来的吗?
This is what you copied off Farrow's note?

282
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:53,119
有三个名字。地址在背面。
It's three names. Addresses on the back.

283
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,694
这些人看起来是认真的。
These guys look like they mean it.

284
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,931
让我们看看这个地址。
Let's check out this address.

285
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,253
告诉我们她在哪里。
Tell us where she is.

286
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:45,923
等一下。
Hold on a second.

287
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,338
这地方租给了玛丽·弗罗里达或弗罗里达。
Place is rented to a Marie Florida or Floreda.

288
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:55,810
几天没人见过她了。
Nobody's seen her in a few days.

289
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:57,654
四楼，后面。
Fourth floor, rear.

290
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,831
你开启了人格。
You turned on the personality.

291
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:00,972
是的。
Yeah.

292
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,680
还有50个大的。
And 50 big ones.

293
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:06,090
警察今天下午来过这里。没有人回家。
The cops were here this afternoon. Nobody home.

294
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:08,109
他们会回来的。
They'll be back.

295
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:09,706
是的。
Yeah.

296
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,683
看来你的钱花得值。
I see you got your money's worth.

297
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,618
如果有线索，她会通知我们的。
Yeah, if any heat shows up, she's gonna buzz us.

298
00:35:25,642 --> 00:35:27,327
是的，希望如此，50美元。
Yeah, I hope so, for $50.

299
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:14,800
衣服不多。
Not many clothes.

300
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,314
家境贫寒的女孩
A girl of slender means.

301
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,374
是的。
Yes.

302
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,128
是的，谢谢你。
Yes, thank you.

303
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:44,867
是三个人。
It's three guys.

304
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:46,927
他们已经在这层了。
They're already on this floor.

305
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:27,679
这里!的行为!
Here! Behave!

306
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:54,227
该死的,狗娘养的!
Goddamn, son-of-a-bitch!

307
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:36,400
弗兰克，来吧。
Frank, will you come on.

308
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:56,632
我的上帝!
My God!

309
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,618
早上好。你好,firebug。
Good morning. Hello, firebug.

310
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:55,156
什么吗?
Anything?

311
00:41:55,777 --> 00:41:57,470
我们收到一封挂号信。
We got a registered letter.

312
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:06,391
嗯，这看起来是个好消息。
Well, that looks like good news.

313
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,693
不，不完全是。
No, not really.

314
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,603
大米给了我们动力。他扣了我们的工资。
Rice has given us the gas. He's taken us off salary.

315
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,923
也许赖斯找到了玛丽·简。
Maybe Rice has found Mary Jane.

316
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:25,828
它没有这么说。
It doesn't say that.

317
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:27,536
我想他是被吓跑了。
I think he got scared off.

318
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,973
我喜欢你的风格。
I like your style.

319
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:47,837
我们还能做什么?
What the hell else we got to do?

320
00:42:48,562 --> 00:42:54,666
听着，我回去找花店，你盯着赖斯。看看你能不能找到他。
Now look, I'll go back and see the florist, you stay on Rice. See if you can run him down.

321
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,553
你要穿这个?
You're gonna wear that?

322
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:54,521
艾尔。
Al.

323
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:57,899
你杀过人吗?
Did you ever kill anybody?

324
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,636
在美国。
In the United States.

325
00:44:04,857 --> 00:44:11,207
因为我知道你是认真的，但是，我比你更了解这些人。
Because I know you mean it and everything, but, I know these guys better than I know you.

326
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:13,242
他们是士兵，仅此而已。
They're soldiers, that's all.

327
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:16,093
没有问题，没有时间问，没有谈话。
No questions, no time to ask, no talk.

328
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:18,838
警察更糟糕，更难以预测。
Cops are worse and less predictable.

329
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:24,052
如果你拔出枪，你就要做好杀人的准备。
If you pull a gun, you gotta be ready to kill somebody.

330
00:44:24,076 --> 00:44:26,206
我跟你说，还是逃跑比较好。
I'm telling you it's better to run.

331
00:44:31,162 --> 00:44:32,165
你做完了吗?
You finished?

332
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:38,812
你想告诉帕帕达基斯昨晚的事吗?
You want to tell Papadakis about last night?

333
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:39,839
嗯…
Well...

334
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:48,998
是的，先生，我喜欢你的风格。
Yes sir, I like your style.

335
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,363
找到帕帕达基斯的位置了吗?
You got a location on Papadakis?

336
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:12,517
那就把他找回来。
Well, get him back.

337
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:14,440
不，这是真的。
No, this is the real thing.

338
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,933
鲍勃。
Bob.

339
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:19,649
打个电话。
Put out a call.

340
00:45:20,353 --> 00:45:22,483
把艾尔·希基和弗兰克·博格斯带来。
Bring in Al Hickey and Frank Boggs.

341
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,437
不，不是逮捕。
No, not an arrest.

342
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:46,908
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell is going on here?

343
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,815
这些钱太热了，会在人行道上烧出一个洞。
This money is so hot, It'll burn a hole in the side walk.

344
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,131
死了两个人。匹兹堡有六人死亡。
Two people dead. Six dead in Pittsburgh.

345
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:55,035
每次有事情发生，你们俩都是幕后推手。
Every time something comes up, you two are part of the woodwork.

346
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,176
现在，我都想要。
Now, I want it all.

347
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,663
不要紧张你的气管。
Don't strain your windpipe.

348
00:45:57,687 --> 00:45:59,356
我警告你，别胡闹。
I'm warning you, don't play around.

349
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,880
现在是谁在耍我们?我们把钱带来了。
Now who's playing around? We brought the money in.

350
00:46:01,904 --> 00:46:03,721
你穿高跟鞋干什么?
What the hell were you doing heeled?

351
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:05,270
一盎司的预防。
An ounce of prevention.

352
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:06,978
我们到底有没有驾照?
We got a license or not?

353
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,036
到目前为止。
So far.

354
00:46:09,578 --> 00:46:11,262
你需要什么?
Well, what do you need?

355
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:14,254
那花店呢?
What about the florist?

356
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:15,776
这是赖斯的线索。
It's a lead from Rice.

357
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,400
两条线索，两个死人。
Two leads, two dead men.

358
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:18,922
我们生活在乱世之中。
We live in troubled times.

359
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:22,240
没错，有很多社会动荡。你找到赖斯了吗?
That's right, there's a lot of social unrest. You find Rice?

360
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:23,519
这是下一件事。
That's the next thing.

361
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:24,897
我们也没有。
We haven't either.

362
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,976
那匹兹堡呢?
Well, what about Pittsburgh?

363
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,613
去年冬天，联邦储备银行，三名警卫被杀，三枚鱼雷被杀，司机带着一袋钱跑了。
Last winter, Federal Reserve Bank, three guards killed, three torpedoes killed, driver got away with a sack of money.

364
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:35,321
大账单。400000岁以上的老人。
Big bills. Over 400,000.

365
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:37,969
司机被打得满身是洞。
Driver got shot full of holes.

366
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:40,750
他们没找到钱，也没找到他女朋友。
They didn't find the money or his girlfriend.

367
00:46:41,242 --> 00:46:43,936
-她叫什么名字?-我们不知道。
- What was her name? - We don't know that.

368
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:47,705
这有奖励吗?
Is there a reward for this?

369
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,609
二万五千年。
Twenty-five thousand.

370
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,092
我想从头再来一遍。
I want to go over this from the top.

371
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:00,950
你需要什么都行。
Anything you need.

372
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:05,753
玛丽·简弄不掉那个面团。
Mary Jane can't get rid of that dough.

373
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:08,276
账单太大了，花不了。
The bills are too big, can't spend it.

374
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:11,292
现在别为那个烦恼了，我们明天要去看比赛。
Don't bother with that now, we're going to the game tomorrow.

375
00:47:11,316 --> 00:47:12,820
法罗是个推销员。
Farrow was a bagman.

376
00:47:14,012 --> 00:47:21,133
她想以最低价卖掉那笔钱。我说我们要去看比赛，现在放松，享受这美好的…什么游戏?
She was trying to unload that dough at knock down rate... I said we're going to the game, now relax and enjoy this good... What game?

377
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:22,808
公羊,猎鹰。
Rams, Falcons.

378
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:27,069
哦,足球…我自己喜欢公羊队。
Oh, football... I favor the Rams myself.

379
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,509
我以为这场比赛的票已经卖光了。
I thought the game was a sell out.

380
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:30,535
它是。
It is.

381
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:34,694
我们找的是玛丽·简·鲍尔，不是罗曼·加布里尔。
We're looking for Mary Jane Bower, not Roman Gabriel.

382
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,536
两万五千美元。
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

383
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:39,536
你想要多大的赔率?
What kind of odds do you want?

384
00:47:43,187 --> 00:47:44,190
公羊队?
On the Rams?

385
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:46,907
玛丽·简去看球赛了。
On Mary Jane being at the ballgame.

386
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,453
小屋,两个……
Hut, two...

387
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,743
我以为她今天会来。
I thought she'd show today.

388
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:26,120
试着制造轰动。
Try to make a hit.

389
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:29,561
让我看看。嗯,哦。
Let me see that. Hmm, oh.

390
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:36,081
法罗的手机旁边也写着同样的话。
Farrow had the same thing written beside his phone.

391
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,789
“公羊，猎鹰，再加一个。”
"Rams, Falcons, plus one."

392
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:41,331
还有这些座位。加1什么?
And these seats. Plus one what?

393
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:44,064
我猜是他们勾搭的人。
Whoever they are hitting on, I guess.

394
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:47,166
加一天?
Plus one day?

395
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,578
什么,明天?
What, tomorrow?

396
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:54,114
我不知道。
I don't know.

397
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,500
他们得定个时间。
Well, they'd have to set a time.

398
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,154
这张票可以打开它。
The ticket could key it.

399
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,134
游戏时间。
Game time.

400
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,001
这些席位。
These seats.

401
00:50:04,312 --> 00:50:05,996
加上一天。是的,很好。
Plus one day. Yeah, well.

402
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:13,023
你好。
Hello.

403
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,559
天啊，不，我不想说话。
Oh, Christ no, I don't wanna talk.

404
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:17,636
我想睡觉。
I wanna sleep.

405
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:22,303
你好像只在睡前记得我的电话号码。
You only seem to remember my phone number at bedtime.

406
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:26,031
不得不在一场足球赛上工作。
Had to work at a football game.

407
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:27,998
你应该带我去的。
Well, you should have taken me.

408
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:31,974
当然，我们要做的任何事，都可以在棒球场做。
Sure, anything we gotta do, we can do at the ballpark.

409
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:08,396
我再看一遍。
Let me see that again.

410
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:19,335
像这样的贿赂只有两个人。
There's only two people in a buyoff like this.

411
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,677
三个很危险。为什么是第三个座位?
Three's dangerous. Why the third seat?

412
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,853
这是什么?
What is this?

413
00:51:24,924 --> 00:51:26,867
什么都没有。上面写着"伊迪丝"
Nothing. Well, it says "Edith."

414
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:28,426
她有一部新手机。

No clues, nothing.

555
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,738
不管怎样，你绝对猜不到是谁打来的。
Anyway, you'll never guess who called.

556
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:53,276
谁?
Who?

557
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:54,520
玛丽简。
Mary Jane.

558
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:56,517
她今晚想见我们。
She wants to see us tonight.

559
01:09:57,113 --> 01:09:59,494
说她很害怕，想放弃。
Said she's scared and wants to give up.

560
01:09:59,568 --> 01:10:02,475
如果我们帮助她，我们就能得到奖励。
If we help her, why then, we can get the reward.

561
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:04,625
我会被诅咒的。
I'll be goddamned.

562
01:10:04,649 --> 01:10:05,652
正确的。
Right.

563
01:10:06,273 --> 01:10:07,702
但是她经常说谎。
But she lies a lot.

564
01:10:08,728 --> 01:10:10,605
她怎么知道我们的电话号码的?
How the hell did she get our number?

565
01:10:10,629 --> 01:10:15,894
只能来自甜蜜的双唇。所以…他找到她了，没错。
Could only come from Sweet Lips. So... He's found her, all right.

566
01:10:15,918 --> 01:10:18,556
黑人社区并没有试图成为新的东西。
Black community is not trying to become something new.

567
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:24,425
其实在其行为、心理上基本上还是白色的。
Is in fact still basically white in its behavior, psychologically.

568
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:33,799
这就是为什么我的领袖，我们的领袖，一遍又一遍地说黑人权力不能嫉妒白人权力。
That's why my leader, our leader, keeps saying over and over again that black power cannot be jealous of white power.

569
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:40,827
它必须对此感到厌倦。它必须知道……绿球区32号后面有四个车位。
It has to be sick of it. It has to know... Four car spaces behind the green ball plot 32.

570
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,097
第八局开始。
The start of the eighth inning.

571
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,239
蓝色雷鸟的后座。
The back seat of the blue Thunderbird.

572
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:49,491
是的，亲爱的，她会来的。
Yes my dear, she will be there.

573
01:10:49,864 --> 01:10:51,442
就像他们说的，双关语。
A punto, as they say.

574
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:54,911
完全正确。
Exactly.

575
01:10:58,402 --> 01:10:59,404
它工作。
It worked.

576
01:11:00,234 --> 01:11:03,494
她所有的线人都被愚蠢的怪物吓跑了。
All her sources have been frightened away by the stupid monsters.

577
01:11:03,518 --> 01:11:04,947
他们并不愚蠢。
They're not stupid.

578
01:11:05,108 --> 01:11:07,261
她必须按我们的价格和我们做生意。
She has to do business with us, at our price.

579
01:11:07,285 --> 01:11:09,228
今晚。我说过我能行。
Tonight. I told you I can do it.

580
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:12,119
她走投无路了，那个讨厌的婊子。
She's desperate, that nasty bitch.

581
01:11:12,298 --> 01:11:15,205
绝望下流的婊子很危险，兄弟。
Desperate, nasty bitches are dangerous, brother.

582
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,274
它会成功的。
It will work.

583
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:18,123
我派菲利普去。
I'm sending Phillip.

584
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:19,973
在阻力。
In drag.

585
01:12:14,866 --> 01:12:16,683
这是八分之一的顶部。
That's the top of the eighth.

586
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,834
嘿。
Hey.

587
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:39,454
这是她的。
That's her.

588
01:13:54,628 --> 01:13:55,631
走了。
Go.

589
01:13:56,461 --> 01:13:57,664
你好。玛丽简吗?
Hello. Mary Jane?

590
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:09,701
持有它。
Hold it.

591
01:14:31,789 --> 01:14:32,917
把门关上!
Shut that door!

592
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:39,316
关门，你个白痴。
Shut the door, you idiot.

593
01:15:09,157 --> 01:15:13,127
停车场里有五百辆车，那群混蛋把我的炸掉了。
Five hundred cars in the lot, and the bastards blow up mine.

594
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:14,866
好吧，以牙还牙。
Well, tit for tat.

595
01:15:16,728 --> 01:15:17,855
一些玛丽·简。
Some Mary Jane.

596
01:15:18,456 --> 01:15:19,884
怎么啦？Bledsoe。
What? It's Bledsoe.

597
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,283
那个我们找不到的人。
The guy we couldn't find.

598
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,047
我得找把大点的枪，我什么都打不到。
I gotta get a bigger gun, I can't hit nothing.

599
01:15:26,683 --> 01:15:28,563
我们怎么解释这个呢?
How we gonna explain this one?

600
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,187
这一次，我们需要一个律师。
Well, this time, we need a lawyer.

601
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:37,181
那个贱人陷害了我们。
That bitch set us up.

602
01:15:46,974 --> 01:15:47,977
是的。
Yeah.

603
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:52,008
等待。等一下，等一下。
Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

604
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:54,763
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

605
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:58,416
卡赞贾默的孩子们，他们刚刚炸掉了道奇体育场。
The Katzenjammer kids, they just blew up Dodger Stadium.

606
01:15:58,624 --> 01:16:01,261
又一个推销员死了。这次我们拿到了钱。
Another bagman's dead. This time we got the money.

607
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:03,416
没有女孩。他们没有击中鱼雷。
No girl. They missed the torpedoes.

608
01:16:03,913 --> 01:16:05,417
他们的借口是什么?
What's their excuse?

609
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:07,588
希基说他接到了那个女孩的电话。
Hickey claims he got a call from the girl.

610
01:16:07,612 --> 01:16:10,519
她说如果他们叫我们去她就不去了。
She said she wouldn't show if they called us in.

611
01:16:11,103 --> 01:16:12,531
我要他们被抓。
I want them busted.

612
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:15,981
隐瞒证据，教唆犯罪行为。
Withholding evidence, abetting felonious conduct.

613
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,106
然后烧掉它们。把他们俩都绑起来。
And burn them. Put a stake up both of them.

614
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:25,028
今晚我就给萨克拉门托打电话，开个听证会，吊销他们的执照，把他们关起来。
Now, I'll call Sacramento tonight, set a hearing, suspend their licenses, break 'em, put 'em away.

615
01:16:25,552 --> 01:16:26,555
嗯。
Mmm-hmm.

616
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:35,299
我们把所有的钱都给了他们，但我们可以留下那2000块。
We gave 'em every piece, but we could have kept that two grand.

617
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:37,408
我们把它交上去，然后去了警察局。
We turned it in and we went to the police department.

618
01:16:37,432 --> 01:16:39,980
不如给我点有用的证据吧?
Well, how about giving me some evidence I can use?

619
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:41,813
如果你能把它扔出去的话。
Well, if you'd get it thrown out.

620
01:16:41,837 --> 01:16:42,988
扔出去吗?
Thrown out?

621
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,816
我们付钱给你到底是为了什么?
What the hell do we pay you for anyway?

622
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,284
他们抓住了你的饼干。
They've got you by the biscuits.

623
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:51,315
找点关系什么的。
Pull some strings or something.

624
01:16:51,377 --> 01:16:53,012
特朗普说点什么，行吗?
Trump something up, can't you?

625
01:16:53,036 --> 01:16:54,854
我是律师，不是魔术师。
I'm a lawyer, not a magician.

626
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,827
我们要出庭受审吗?
We're gonna have to stand trial?

627
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:03,668
除非他们撤销指控。
Unless they drop the charges.

628
01:17:04,927 --> 01:17:05,930
我不知道。
I don't know.

629
01:17:07,762 --> 01:17:08,765
怎么啦？
What?

630
01:17:10,908 --> 01:17:12,487
是时候出去了。
It's time to get out.

631
01:17:14,191 --> 01:17:15,194
出于什么?
Out of what?

632
01:17:15,851 --> 01:17:19,318
这个职业已经没有什么可干的了，弗兰克。都结束了。
There's nothing left of this profession, Frank. It's all over.

633
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:20,735
这不是关于任何事情。
It's not about anything.

634
01:17:20,759 --> 01:17:22,291
嗯，他是对的。
Well, he's right.

635
01:17:22,315 --> 01:17:25,222
再也没有私家侦探这回事了。
No such thing as a private investigator anymore.

636
01:17:25,323 --> 01:17:31,147
随着萨克拉门托过去几年的立法，你们这些人只不过是流程服务人员。
With the legislation coming out of Sacramento the last couple of years, you guys are nothing but process servers.

637
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:35,856
这不是关于任何事情。
It's not about anything.

638
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:40,343
-是啊。-大约40万。
- Yeah, it is. - It's about 400 grand.

639
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:48,525
我们得找到那个贱人。
Well, we gotta find that bitch.

640
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,832
他们真的让你很为难。
They've really got you up against it.

641
01:19:12,863 --> 01:19:17,063
是的。这就是所谓的推，它们在推。
Yeah. Well, that's what's known as pushing, they're pushing.

642
01:19:19,984 --> 01:19:21,638
你要怎么做?
What are you gonna do?

643
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:25,207
你只需要反击，继续前进。
Just have to push back and keep going.

644
01:19:30,285 --> 01:19:32,416
下班后我去你家。
I'll come to your place after work.

645
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:35,298
你会吗?
Uh, you will?

646
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:41,594
我等你。
I'll wait for you.

647
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:43,979
是的，很好。
Yeah, that's nice.

648
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:46,496
是的。情况正在好转。
Yeah. Things are looking up.

649
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:57,745
你管他们叫士兵。你管他们叫士兵。
You call them soldiers. You call them soldiers.

650
01:19:58,493 --> 01:19:59,495
他们错过了。
They missed.

651
01:19:59,944 --> 01:20:01,887
两辆车被炸成碎片。
Two cars blown to goddamn hell.

652
01:20:03,402 --> 01:20:06,033
他们错过了。两根铅笔脖子比他强。
They missed. Outgunned by two pencil necks.

653
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:09,224
告诉我，他们怎么能这样?解释它。
Tell me, how could they? Explain it.

654
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:12,048
我想听听他们是怎么失手的。这是什么?
I want to hear how they missed. What is it?

655
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:13,909
沉默吗?黄色的?
Dumbness? Yellow?

656
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,511
你到底来这儿干什么?
What the hell do you come in here for?

657
01:20:33,752 --> 01:20:34,754
音乐。
The music.

658
01:20:38,212 --> 01:20:39,904
我想他们拿了你的啤酒。
I think they got your beer.

659
01:20:42,878 --> 01:20:44,696
来吧，我们给你买辆车。
Come on, let's buy you a car.

660
01:20:47,683 --> 01:20:51,584
你先是要卖掉我的房子，现在又要给我买辆车。
First you're gonna sell my house and now you're gonna buy me a car.

661
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:55,387
如果你不再管房子的事，我就给你买辆车。
I'm gonna buy you a goddamn car if you lay off about the house.

662
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,923
这是一个好房子。
It was a good house.

663
01:20:56,947 --> 01:20:57,949
是什么。
Was.

664
01:20:58,607 --> 01:20:59,609
现在依然如此。
It still is.

665
01:21:00,749 --> 01:21:03,068
至少它没有掉下悬崖。
At least it's not falling off a cliff.

666
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:06,152
那你的保证呢，好让你去买保险?
Well, where's your word, so you can get the insurance for it?

667
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:08,056
太迟了，用完了。
Ah, it's too late, it ran out.

668
01:21:10,705 --> 01:21:12,898
跑了出去。弗兰克，弗兰克，弗兰克，弗兰克。
Ran out. Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

669
01:21:13,955 --> 01:21:14,957
看。
Look.

670
01:21:15,614 --> 01:21:18,434
镇上所有人都要把我们烧了。
Everybody in this town is about to burn us up.

671
01:21:19,451 --> 01:21:21,143
你现在不能对我坏了。
You can't go bad on me now.

672
01:21:24,325 --> 01:21:26,009
弗兰克，你还不明白吗?
Frank, don't you get it?

673
01:21:26,641 --> 01:21:29,022
我们的照片登在所有的报纸上。
Our pictures are in all the newspapers.

674
01:21:29,268 --> 01:21:30,952
他们要把我们埋了。
They are going to bury us.

675
01:21:31,895 --> 01:21:33,549
一方或另一方。
One side or the other.

676
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:39,654
伊迪丝来了。
Edith is here.

677
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,185
伊迪丝来了。
Edith is here.

678
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:49,876
她马上就来，然后我们就走。
She'll be on in a minute and then we'll go.

679
01:21:52,602 --> 01:21:54,732
我以为她被禁止进来了?
I thought she was barred from here?

680
01:21:55,402 --> 01:21:56,905
那家伙欠我人情。
Guy owed me a favor.

690
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:13,958
杀了你自己。
Kill yourself.

691
01:23:15,705 --> 01:23:17,584
我们要去哪里?我们要去哪里?
Where do we go? Where do we go?

692
01:23:19,023 --> 01:23:20,376
在大街上。
Out on the street.

693
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:22,629
玛丽·简不会再给我们打电话了。
Mary Jane isn't gonna call us any more.

694
01:23:22,653 --> 01:23:24,337
她这么做是为了什么?
What's she doing it for?

695
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,398
重磅炸弹和我们。
The heavies and us.

696
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,434
我们在推她。
We're pushing her.

697
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:33,034
她觉得不管我们死了谁，她都好。
She figures whichever one of us is dead, she's better off.

698
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:34,742
她牺牲了两个推销员。
She sacrificed two bagmen.

699
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:38,604
也就是说她有人可以卖给她。你能看见吗?
That means she's got somebody to sell it to. Can you see?

700
01:23:43,636 --> 01:23:46,703
玛丽·简和花店老板的哥哥有一笔大交易。
Mary Jane had a big deal with the florist's brother.

701
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,350
监狱里的那个，他在奇诺。
The one in jail, he's at Chino.

702
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:51,597
我明天早上要去那里，四处看看。
I'm going down there tomorrow morning, poke around.

703
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:52,946
你还缺一辆车。
You're still short one car.

704
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,849
是的，我会想办法的。
Yeah, I'll work something out.

705
01:23:57,429 --> 01:23:58,545
你呢?
What about you?

706
01:23:58,569 --> 01:24:00,481
我会从海边的房子开始。
I'll start with the house at the beach.

707
01:24:00,505 --> 01:24:02,259
最后一轮。这是正确的。
Last go round. That's right.

708
01:24:03,374 --> 01:24:04,377
你能看见吗?
Can you see?

709
01:24:53,913 --> 01:24:55,116
它是如何运行的?
How does it run?

710
01:24:55,226 --> 01:24:56,228
棒极了。
Terrific.

711
01:24:56,643 --> 01:24:57,646
我买了。
I'll take it.

712
01:26:52,895 --> 01:26:53,897
是的。
Yeah.

713
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,715
听着，鱼雷击中了我家。
Yeah, listen, the torpedoes hit my place.

714
01:26:57,009 --> 01:27:00,136
把它拆开了。他们可能正在来找你的路上。
Pulled it apart. They may be on their way to see you.

715
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,523
他们没有什么目的，没有。
They weren't after anything, not really.

716
01:27:05,547 --> 01:27:07,050
这不是一份好工作。
It's not a good job.

717
01:27:07,137 --> 01:27:09,581
他们乐在其中，就像复仇一样。
They got a kick out of it, like revenge.

718
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:16,461
他们已经来过了。
They've already been here.

719
01:27:31,127 --> 01:27:35,231
该死的大学生们，大半夜的，我们要打扫房子。
Goddamn college boys, in the middle of the night, we're gonna clean house.

720
01:27:44,954 --> 01:27:46,608
他走了进来。
He walked in.

721
01:27:49,033 --> 01:27:50,912
他说他想回家。
He says he wants to come home.

722
01:27:52,973 --> 01:27:54,402
我认为他是对的。
I think he's right.

723
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:59,389
但我也认为他欠我们很多利息。
But I also think he owes us a lot of interest.

724
01:27:59,611 --> 01:28:01,616
我觉得他还欠我们一笔奖金。
I think he owes us another bonus.

725
01:28:22,011 --> 01:28:24,026
他们说，我们必须完成它。
They said, we have to go through with it.

726
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,306
赖斯和那个黑人的交易。
The deal with Rice and the black man.

727
01:29:01,695 --> 01:29:03,379
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

728
01:29:07,814 --> 01:29:09,092
妮欧娜不在这里。
Nyona's not here.

729
01:29:10,037 --> 01:29:11,917
她死了，是你杀了她。
She's dead and you killed her.

730
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:15,231
我不希望你再和这个孩子在一起。
And I don't want you around this child ever again.

731
01:29:15,844 --> 01:29:17,198
你是个烂……
You're a rotten...

732
01:29:22,516 --> 01:29:28,371
从两年前你走进这间房子的那一刻起我就知道你是个卑鄙下流的混蛋。
I know from the moment you walked into this house two years ago that you're a rotten, low down, son-of-a-bitch.

733
01:29:29,775 --> 01:29:30,827
我是认真的。
And I mean it.

734
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:34,211
我再也不想见到你了。
I don't ever want to see your face again.

735
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:35,237
了。
Ever again.

736
01:30:57,278 --> 01:30:58,330
都准备好了吗?
Is it all set?

737
01:30:58,453 --> 01:30:59,455
是的。
Yep.

738
01:31:00,734 --> 01:31:01,737
好。
Good.

739
01:31:02,186 --> 01:31:04,191
不会再失手了。不要再犯错了。
No more misses. No more mistakes.

740
01:31:06,162 --> 01:31:07,164
好吧。
All right.

741
01:31:18,555 --> 01:31:19,608
你没事吧?
You all right?

742
01:31:24,328 --> 01:31:25,330
好。
Good.

743
01:31:25,745 --> 01:31:27,069
我去过中国。
I've been to Chino.

744
01:31:27,093 --> 01:31:31,045
奎曼多是前天假释出来的。
Quemando got out, on parole, day before yesterday.

745
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:32,272
一个女人遇见了他。

746
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:36,866
她登记的名字是玛丽·弗罗里达·奎曼多。
She signed in as Mary Florida Quemando.

747
01:31:39,641 --> 01:31:40,644
的妻子。
Wife.

748
01:31:41,715 --> 01:31:42,718
宾果。
Bingo.

749
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:50,737
我从假释官那里得到了他们的地址。
I got their address from the parole officer.

750
01:31:52,052 --> 01:31:53,806
好了，我们开始吧。
So, okay, we're in business.

751
01:31:56,926 --> 01:31:58,204
我们去找他们吧。
Let's go get 'em.

752
01:32:02,214 --> 01:32:04,093
我知道你想要鱼雷。
I know you want the torpedoes.

753
01:32:04,495 --> 01:32:08,046
我们找到那个女人，他们就在附近。
We find the woman, they're gonna be close.

754
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:13,114
哦，该死的，他们不会进来的。
Oh, look goddammit, they're not coming in here.

755
01:32:15,904 --> 01:32:16,956
这是一个机会。
It's a chance.

756
01:32:27,552 --> 01:32:28,605
这是一个机会。
It's a chance.

757
01:32:47,325 --> 01:32:48,453
好吧，你不干了。
Okay, you quit.

758
01:32:51,093 --> 01:32:52,096
很好。
Fine.

759
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:57,761
躺下，在这里滚一滚。
Just lay down and roll over right here.

760
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:04,896
这是个适合你做的好地方。
It's a nice place for you to do it.

761
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,301
至少我们不会渴了。
At least we're not going to be thirsty.

762
01:33:09,242 --> 01:33:10,244
鲍勃。
Bob.

763
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:13,107
我们来一个。就在这儿。
Let's have one. Right here please.

764
01:33:13,389 --> 01:33:15,958
因为我要加入我的朋友兼搭档。
Because I'm joining my friend and partner.

765
01:33:37,103 --> 01:33:38,106
哦,弗兰克。
Oh, Frank.

766
01:33:38,693 --> 01:33:40,824
弗兰克，你现在不能对我发脾气。
Frank, you can't go bad on me now.

767
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:44,211
他们会把我们埋了。
They're gonna bury us.

768
01:33:46,506 --> 01:33:51,155
就因为你没法把这个愚蠢，愚蠢，可怜的婊子从你肚子里赶出去。
Just because you can't get this dumb, stupid, pitiful bitch out of your guts.

769
01:34:04,308 --> 01:34:05,837
看看是谁在说话。
Look who's talking.

770
01:34:09,632 --> 01:34:13,419
你就坐在那，我去拿。
You just sit there 'cause I'm gonna go get them.

771
01:34:14,091 --> 01:34:15,618
我想要那25。
I want that 25.

772
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:51,861
你可以在那里坐很长时间，但你不能让她回来。
You can sit there for a long time, but you can't bring her back.

773
01:34:52,565 --> 01:34:56,497
你无法弥补你错过的。
And you can't make up for what you missed.

774
01:34:58,614 --> 01:34:59,617
所有……
All...

775
01:35:02,037 --> 01:35:03,721
你唯一能做的就是
Only thing you can do is

776
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:09,355
该死的，尽量扯平。
goddamn try to even it up.

777
01:35:13,513 --> 01:35:15,065
纠正错误。
Make it right.

778
01:35:19,943 --> 01:35:23,010
现在我要出去，我要抓住他们。所以…
Now I'm going out there and I'm gonna get 'em. So...

779
01:35:59,818 --> 01:36:01,384
现在你告诉我她在哪。
Now you tell me where she is.

780
01:36:01,408 --> 01:36:04,039
告诉我她在哪，不然我就杀了你。
Tell me where she is or I'm gonna kill you.

781
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:06,961
他会的。
He will.

782
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:12,197
不要沮丧。你没什么好哭的。
Don't be depressed. You got nothing to cry about.

783
01:36:13,818 --> 01:36:18,184
在监狱里策划一场价值40万美元的越狱是非常困难的。
It's very difficult to run a $400,000 caper from a prison cell.

784
01:36:18,865 --> 01:36:20,369
你做得很好。
You did pretty good.

785
01:36:22,529 --> 01:36:24,213
你还有玛丽·简。
You still got Mary Jane.

786
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:28,349
她一定是个了不起的女人。
She must be a heck of a woman.

787
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:34,401
替你杀了法罗，因为他想要更大的份额，在你出狱之前一直掌控大局。
Killed Farrow for you cause he wanted a bigger bite, ran the whole show till you got out.

788
01:36:35,526 --> 01:36:37,210
她真是个好女人。
She's one hell of a woman.

789
01:36:40,204 --> 01:36:43,917
你们俩当然会被起诉，但这太牵强了，他们站不住脚。
Course you'll both be indicted, but it's too shaky, they won't make it stick.

790
01:36:45,517 --> 01:36:48,965
所以…也许你还能回家。
So... Maybe you'll still get home.

791
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,057
他是在告诉你情况可能会更糟。
He's telling you things could be a whole lot worse.

792
01:36:55,956 --> 01:36:57,084
想想看。
Think about it.

793
01:37:13,275 --> 01:37:15,280
赖斯先生，跟博格斯先生打个招呼。
Mr. Rice, say hello to Mr. Boggs.

794
01:37:17,354 --> 01:37:18,356
莱斯先生。
Mr. Rice.

795
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:21,295
勒罗伊先生。
Mr. Leroy.

796
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:23,359
跟希基先生打个招呼。
Say hello to Mr. Hickey.

797
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,466
真是一落千丈啊?
It really fell off the cliff, huh?

798
01:37:29,902 --> 01:37:34,601
真遗憾，但我的搭档跟你做了笔好交易。
That's a shame, but my partner has a hell of a deal for you.

799
01:37:35,502 --> 01:37:37,570
房子很棒，周围环境也不错。
Terrific house, fine neighborhood.

800
01:37:39,684 --> 01:37:41,037
你听他的。
You listen to him.

801
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:45,218
你就照希基先生说的做。
You just do what Mr. Hickey tells you.

802
01:37:59,527 --> 01:38:02,347
我要按照设定的那样做。
I'm gonna do everything just as it was set up.

803
01:38:02,372 --> 01:38:03,413
好吧?
Okay?

804
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:07,109
好吧，勒罗伊先生?
Okay, Mr. Leroy?

805
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,916
这是你的游戏，兄弟。
It's your play, brother.

806
01:38:34,163 --> 01:38:35,847
你怎么选这个地方的?
How'd you pick this place?

807
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,059
我们过去常来这里。
We used to come here.

808
01:38:39,141 --> 01:38:40,915
好了，出去准备好。
Okay, get out there and get ready.

809
01:38:40,939 --> 01:38:43,846
把她放下来，就像一切正常一样。
Wave her down just like everything was all right.

810
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,684
把这个包带走。
Take the bag with you.

811
01:48:47,022 --> 01:48:48,024
没人来了。
Nobody came.

812
01:48:55,008 --> 01:48:56,010
没有人在乎。
Nobody cares.

813
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:05,032
谢谢。
Thanks.

814
01:49:07,176 --> 01:49:08,178
任何时候。
Anytime.

815
01:49:08,489 --> 01:49:10,368
这仍然不是关于任何事情。
It's still not about anything.

816
01:49:13,535 --> 01:49:15,219
我知道，你告诉过我。
Yeah, I know, you told me.
