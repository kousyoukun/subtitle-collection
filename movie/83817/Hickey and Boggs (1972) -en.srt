1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,950
My God, protect us now.

2
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,710
It seems that you are receiving
the most blows to the shoulders and arms.

3
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,870
We see that it sticks not strong
with the left.

4
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,000
EL RASTRO DE UN SUAVE PERFUME

5
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,200
That afternoon, connect say that Perkins

6
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,790
She kissed the canvas in the
2nd round, counting up to 8.

7
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,350
We come to the end of the sixth round!

8
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,310
Did you pay the phone?

9
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,710
We need money.
Who will give it?

10
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,070
My House is paid.
Almost.

11
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,770
 Qu  dices?
Esa casa no vale nada.

12
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,030
- Es buena.
- S , maravillosa.

13
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,550
- Me prometiste encontrarlo.
- Te dije que lo intentar a.

14
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,670
Quisiera librarme de ella.

15
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,340
 Por qu  no
se la das a alguien?

16
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,750
Tendr amos que trasladar
la oficina a mi coche.

17
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,980
Hay sitio para el tel f.
y el contestador autom tico.

18
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,550
- Es una buena casa.
- No para dos.

19
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,890
Quiero deshacerme de ella.

20
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,390
La conexi n est  pagada,
podemos recibir mensajes.

21
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,070
Nosotros podemos
recibir llamadas,

22
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,110
 y quieres decirme c mo haremos
para poder contestadas?

23
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,750
Tenemos una cita para ma ana.

24
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,830
 Para hacer qu ?
- No es para hacer nada.

25
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,670
It's just a date.

26
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,590
Already.

27
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,950
- You can go t ,  no?
- Yes.

28
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,230
Well, I'm going to see
if I hold it strong.

29
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,150
Yes.

30
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,580
Remember the money
of Pittsburgh?

31
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,040
- The one who cheated us.
-The one who disappeared?

32
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,150
Yes.

33
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,430
Last night, Bernie and I
We were having dinner

34
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,580
and a guy who danced,
he fell right next to me.

35
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,020
Is the woman.
The woman of Burning.

36
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,550
He has given one to each
concealer of the city.

37
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,430
As business cards.
Try to sell our pasta.

38
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,230
Is it dangerous?

39
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,310
Do not.
For us.

40
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,670
Warn the boys.

41
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,430
Mr. Hickey
Mr. Boggs?

42
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,710
Hickey

43
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,150
Mr. Boggs does not
Does he meet with us?

44
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,030
He is in the office. What can we do?
Do for you, Mr. Rice?

45
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,840
- Leave me.
-But if you do not know how to sign.

46
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,550
Do not say nonsense.

47
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,110
Say?

48
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,510
Yes.

49
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,190
Clear.

50
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,150
Agree.

51
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,430
T  warn Monte,
We'll go find the fat one.

52
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,390
Voucher.

53
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,470
Can I call my mom?

54
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,830
Clear.

55
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,510
It must be done delicately.
I have not seen her for a long time.

56
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,230
Only find it.
It's the only thing he should do.

57
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,710
I do not want you to talk
with her, understood?

58
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,670
I could be scared.

59
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,230
Discretion

60
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,430
You know what I want to say.

61
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,950
Only find it
and tell it to you.

62
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,870
Exact.

63
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,790
- Jack.
- S ?

64
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,510
I'm going to take the GTO.
The special one.

65
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,870
Mount, the keys are
in the rearview mirror.

66
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,670
These things may take.

67
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,230
I hope it is not too much.

68
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,630
The question of money remains.

69
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,950
200 a day more expenses.

70
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,720
I see.
Helping the inflation.

71
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,310
It was a joke.

72
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,190
Very good, the service number
that collects my messages

73
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,150
is in one of those
pieces of paper.

74
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,550
Call when you have
something to say.

75
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,150
500 dollars
As an advance.

76
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,430
A test of confidence.

77
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,710
Is it enough?

78
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,990
I think I am, Mr. Rice.

79
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,590
Well, "arrivederci", Mr. Hickey.

80
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,230
Try not to burn yourself.

81
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,910
- We have work.
- What a joy.

82
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,430
- I hate to bother you.
-So dont do it.

83
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,310
Do you see this girl?

84
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,660
-What does he teach?
- It's our job.

85
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,260
- Mary Jane Bowen.
-S .

86
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,750
Tell me about it.

87
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,310
An individual named Rice
He wants us to find it.

88
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,430
For what?

89
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,950
- A romantic relationship.
- It seems that the march is going.

90
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,670
Yes, and do not make fun of him.
We have 500 bucks to account.

91
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,270
You think the money
Does it drive me crazy?

92
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,710
Farrow, Shaw ..
Who is this last?

93
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,630
Burning
I think he's Hispanic.

94
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,070
When she saw Rice
by last goes?

95
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,110
3 weeks ago.

96
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,030
I will see Farrow
and you're looking for Shaw.

97
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,230
They were friends, but Rice already
he does not want to know anything about them.

98
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,430
- He only wants Mary Jane.
- It's your money.

99
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,790
And a part
it's going to be for us

100
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,240
In case you speak
with any of those guys,

101
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,190
Rice does not want
his name is mentioned.

102
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,670
How is Nyona?

103
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,470
What Nyona?

104
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,440
Whatever it is, I do not want
I do not care what he does.

105
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,230
The blinds are down,
He has not gotten up yet.

106
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,990
Men are all the same.

107
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,550
Who is it?

108
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,150
I could start
saying hello".

109
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,230
Hi.

110
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,990
How is it
the public servant?

111
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,030
I'm in a hurry.
Who is it?

112
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,710
I think his name is Farrow.

113
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,700
-What were you doing here?
Following the trail to a girl.

114
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,350
He was a clue.

115
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,630
Looking at the mailbox,
I found Mr. Farrow

116
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,140
lived in apartment 1338 A.

117
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,200
So making use of m 
special deduction capacity,

118
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,590
I headed up the stairs towards
the apartment 1338 A.

119
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,630
No jokes

120
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,230
Note for the mechanic:
delete the last observation of Hickey

121
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,390
and my comment.
Get to the point.

122
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,110
Is there something?

123
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,910
It's been a long time
Do not see Mary Jane, years.

124
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,420
They went out with some brothers
called Burning.

125
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,830
Mary Jane's boyfriend
went to the moneybag for robbery.

126
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,910
Go item. Tomorrow we will go
to see the other Mr. Burning.

127
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,310
- Yes.
- Voucher.

128
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,900
-What about Farrow?
- He has eaten p lvora.

129
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,380
-He's dead?
- Yes.

130
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,950
Are you going to tell me something about him?

131
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,190
Looking at the buzzer, I deduced that Farrow
lived in apartment 1338 A.

132
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,150
What happened?

133
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,890
They have loaded a guy.

134
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,550
-  Robbery?
- Not seem.

135
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,850
As soon as I opened
the door, they liquidated it.

136
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,260
-Who has the report?
-It's in your office.

137
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,430
Shaw writes the statement
of Hickey, the one who found it.

138
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,150
Who is Hickey?

139
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,310
I was in the Hollen section.

140
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,270
Hello!

141
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,870
It does not have any grace,
dammit!

142
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,270
Your sense of humor is pathetic.
Go to the horn!

143
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,390
How timely!
Give me a towel

144
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,470
Go, get out of here.
Wait in another room.

145
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,590
I almost had a heart attack.
Everything you do is very funny.

146
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,430
- It was just a form of ...
- Wait in another room.

147
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,460
Do you feel better?

148
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,230
What do you want?

149
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,750
Want to see you.

150
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,990
- For the first time in 3 weeks.
- I have been working.

151
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,950
In what?

152
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,510
Come on, honey,
tranquil zate, will you?

153
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,700
I do not like this, you go
As if you still lived in this house.

154
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,830
- Viv a.
- But not anymore.

155
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,230
Now you live somewhere else.

156
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,710
You threw me out
I had to find another site.

157
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,560
With all the drunks
from the city.

158
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,880
You will be very happy
the 2 in that place.

159
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,390
Look, I'm tired of this.
I can not take it anymore.

160
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,950
Do you want me to leave?

161
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,670
Yes.

162
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,830
Voucher.

163
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,950
I will give you another chance.

164
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,430
Not tonight
I have it free, do you understand?

165
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,230
Ah rrame the drama.

166
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,430
A woman called Fine Sopp.

167
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,670
Although he has been
inactive lately.

168
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,430
A man named Bledsoe.
That is a good possibility.

169
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,670
My old partner,
Clifton Farrow,

170
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,870
I found out that he has entered
in negotiations with that person,

171
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,110
that woman.

172
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,230
They must have
Be very careful with him.

173
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,110
- We have it.
-Are they all?

174
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,350
There are not too many people
on the West Coast

175
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,710
able to do
big transactions.

176
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,150
How much is it really about?

177
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,990
In any case, these are
those who traffic with currency,

178
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,560
or buy it in this area.

179
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,430
We have got four cats.
Chandler is going to kill me.

180
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,130
I could call those people
for you and suggest

181
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,310
that refuse to enter
in dealings with that woman.

182
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,220
Do you want to hang up?

183
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,550
And he has not heard
of Mary Jane Bowen?

184
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,790
No, not now.
I am sorry.

185
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,550
But if I do ...
Perd n

186
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,790
If I can be of any help ...

187
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,910
We have already entertained you
Pretty, sir ...

188
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,430
Good evening, Mr. Rice.

189
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,310
Thanks for your sincerity.

190
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,030
- Lie.
- I know.

191
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,040
For now it does not matter.

192
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,710
Take care of this.
Now, tonight.

193
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,070
- No no.
- If it's lost, tell me.

194
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,830
- I have to present a report.
- Here it is.

195
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,910
HERE,  ve?

196
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,990
A key is nothing more than
a key until it opens something.

197
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,470
I have to take it to me
a traffic test.

198
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,670
I'll give it back to you
this afternoon or tomorrow.

199
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,570
If there has been a misunderstanding,
and I hope that is all,

200
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,310
It is my responsibility to clarify it.

201
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,110
An amateur less to the sport.

202
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,630
She is a good woman, she is
A little confused, that's all.

203
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,490
When you leave the apartment,
Would you mind telling us?

204
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,690
I would like to take a look,
just in case.

205
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,470
We also have
work to do

206
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,710
Yes, it's fine.

207
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,710
Do not forget
to return the key.

208
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,590
I need a little more sugar.

209
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,230
Something new?

210
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,710
No, the? Florister? A is closed.

211
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,670
Give me a puppy with chili.

212
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,310
- Two.
- Three.

213
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,430
Let there be four
and two coca-tails.

214
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,390
Found this where Farrow.

215
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,340
And also this.

216
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,500
Caramba.

217
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,230
Sorry to have to return them.

218
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,710
Yes.
Let's call Rice first.

219
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,070
I've already done it.
Cancel the service this morning.

220
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,190
I paid the bill and it has not stopped
another number, so let's eat.

221
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,790
"Averiado".

222
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,870
- In the drain pipe.
- Yes, in the kitchen.

223
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,910
-Do you hear the names?
- Do not.

224
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,830
  Hickey?

225
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,030
We can not do
all for you

226
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,070
-How did you get in?
- Walking.

227
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,390
The apt is sealed.

228
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,310
Stop bullshit
and thanks.

229
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,590
- We would have found it.
- Yes, from here to a month.

230
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,030
- We are giving you a hand.
- It's fine, you've touched me.

231
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,630
Check it
Come on, get going.

232
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,630
Voucher.

233
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,030
- Do it well, boys.
- Av sanos if something comes up.

234
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,730
-Do you make a copy of the note?
- It's in my pocket.

235
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,380
Papadakis will go
ahead in this.

236
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,770
Fucks me giving these guys nothing.

237
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,150
Yeah, but if we do not,
leave us without a license.

238
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,610
Only
we're looking for Mary Jane.

239
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,150
I know, but still ...

240
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,800
You have a visit

241
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,990
-What do you want?
- Se or Burning?

242
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,150
The same.

243
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,670
We are private detectives,
Mr. Burning.

244
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,890
It means they are not police.

245
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,030
We're looking for Mary Jane Bowen.

246
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,680
Say, have you seen her?

247
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,350
We only look for it.
Nothing happens.

248
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,510
I have not seen
for 5 years.

249
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,630
I only sell flowers.

250
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,510
We do not have Mary Jane,
nor client.

251
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,950
This is what you copied
of Farrow's note?

252
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,590
There are three names
and directions behind.

253
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,190
It seems that they are plotting something.

254
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,870
Let's check these signs.

255
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,790
Tell us, where are you?

256
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,350
Wait.

257
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,680
The apartment is rented to a
such Mary Florida, or Florera.

258
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,630
They have not seen it for a long time.
Fourth floor, in the background.

259
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,000
- You have used your persuasion.
- Yes, and fifty bucks.

260
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,990
The cops have been this afternoon.
No one.

261
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,950
Go back

262
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,030
Yes.

263
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,150
You have invested your money well.

264
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,270
If someone appears,
will warn us?

265
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,310
I hope so.
With fifty turkeys.

266
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,590
- There are not many clothes.
- I would not have money.

267
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,180
  S ?

268
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,820
Yes thanks.

269
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,510
They are here.
There are three types.

270
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,670
  Eh, be careful!

271
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,750
Dammit.

272
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,670
Frank, do you want to come already?

273
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,550
My God.

274
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,860
"In reference to your request
of identification with respect

275
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,110
to thousand-dollar bills, with
serial numbers L41405982 C

276
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,310
and L41405983 C,

277
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,070
The above mentioned has not been
recovered from the theft

278
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,390
to the City Bank
15-10-71 ".

279
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,990
- Good morning.
- Hi, pir mano.

280
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,030
-Is there something?
- A certified cane.

281
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,630
Is it good news?

282
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,160
Not precisely.

283
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,590
Rice has given us a ballot,
It has left us untouched.

284
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,470
There may be
found Mary Jane.

285
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,030
It do not says that.

286
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,550
I think he is afraid.

287
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,830
- I like your style.
-What else can we do?

288
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,830
Listen, I'm going
to see the florist again.

289
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,660
T  oc pate de Rice, to see
if you can locate him

290
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,110
Are you going to put it on?

291
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,110
To the.

292
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,390
Have you ever killed

293
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,870
in the U.S?

294
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,590
Because I know what you're thinking,
but I know those people,

295
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,870
better than yourself.

296
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,950
They are bullies, nothing more.

297
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,980
Neither questions, nor time
to ask, or to talk.

298
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,470
The cops are more predictable.

299
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,990
If you wear a revolver, you should be
ready to kill.

300
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,310
I tell you it's better to run.

301
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,390
Have you finished?

302
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,110
You want to tell him
Papadakis last night?

303
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,620
Good...

304
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,590
I like your style.

305
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,550
Have you located Papadakis?

306
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,430
Tell him to come back.
No, it's something important.

307
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,670
Bob, distribute this.

308
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,310
Bring Al Hickey and Frank Boggs.

309
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,270
No, it's not an arrest.

310
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,470
What the hell is happening?

311
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,150
That money is red hot!
Stunning!

312
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,470
2 people killed,
another 6 in Pittsburgh.

313
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,230
Every time something happens,
you two are in the middle.

314
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,820
- I want to know everything.
- You'll stay af nico.

315
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,530
I warn you,
do not go for the branches.

316
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,750
Who goes by the branches?
We brought the money.

317
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,150
-What did you do there?
- Investigating a little.

318
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,350
- We have a license,  no?
- Yes, for now.

319
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,510
What did you need?

320
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,030
-What about the florist?
- It was a Rice track.

321
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,550
2 tracks,
2 dead men.

322
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,190
We live difficult times.

323
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,030
There is a lot of social agitation.
Have you found Rice?

324
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,670
- Not yet.
Wonderful.

325
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,790
-What's the matter with Pittsburgh?
-Last winter.

326
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,400
In the Federal Reserve Bank.
3 dead guards,

327
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,190
3 dead assailants,
the driver escaped with the money.

328
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,470
Big bills.
Almost four hundred thousand.

329
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,110
They riddled the driver.

330
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,430
They did not find the money
nor his companion.

331
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,630
-What was her name?
- We do not know.

332
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,830
Is reward offered?

333
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,550
Twenty-five thousand.

334
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,910
I want to review this.
From above.

335
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,430
If you need us ...

336
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,910
She can not
get rid of the pasta.

337
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,350
The bills
They're too big.

338
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,110
Do not worry about that.
Tomorrow we will go to the game.

339
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,270
Farrow was an intermediary.

340
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,710
She was trying to let go
that pasta under pressure.

341
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,910
I said that tomorrow we will go
to the match. Rel jate and enjoy.

342
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,430
-What a match?
- Rams and Falcons.

343
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,430
Your rugby-

344
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,750
I'm in favor of the Rams.

345
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,960
-  Was not everything sold?
- He is.

346
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,510
We have to look
to Mary Jane Bowen,

347
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,310
not a rugby player.
There are twenty-five thousand dollars.

348
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,190
How much do you want to bet?

349
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,160
  To the Rams?

350
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,740
What a Mary Jane
is in the game.

351
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,680
I thought he would let himself be seen.
Go success.

352
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,550
Give me the envelope.

353
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,030
Farrow had the same written.

354
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,150
"Rams- Falcons
More 1 "

355
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,470
- In these seats.
-  More one what?

356
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,190
The person they expected.

357
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,430
More days?

358
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,070
  Ma ana?

359
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,310
- I do not know.
-What will be the date?

360
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,310
The entrance is the key.

361
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,060
Time of the match,
these seats, more a day.

362
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,380
While.

363
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,670
Say?

364
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,150
God no. I do not want
talk, I want to sleep

365
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,590
You only remember my phone
at bedtime.

366
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,590
You had work in a party,
You could have taken me.

367
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,990
Of course, everything we have to do,
we can do it in the field.

368
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,550
Give it to me again.

369
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,900
It only takes two people
in a transaction.

370
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,070
Three is dangerous.
Why a third party?

371
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,990
-What is this?
- Nothing.

372
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,700
- It says "Edith."
- It has changed in number.

373
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,350
You have seen her again.

374
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,070
I stopped paying the pension
and it is without white. Need help.

375
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,910
What has become of the friend,
the one in the big house?

376
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,150
Whatever,
It has happened yesterday.

377
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,790
He was still there the night before last.

378
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,390
Maybe I found a bigger one.

379
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,470
A guy with
a bigger house

380
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,390
Do not.

381
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,190
He tried to go back to his old
I work, then he ech .

382
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,030
- I wonder why?
- It's fine.

383
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,150
Is it the only pot?
Voucher.

384
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,630
And this do not miss it.

385
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,990
What?

386
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,390
- My house was very small.
- I know, you told me.

387
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,830
  Eh!

388
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,750
It's yours, Hickey!

389
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,750
How is it supposed to
are we going to explain this?

390
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,920
  To the Rams?

391
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,230
To the cops.

392
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,070
I'll think of something.

393
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,630
- Thank you, sir.
- Good sound.

394
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,870
As soon as possible, thank you.

395
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,310
We have got one.

396
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,990
Did they take the girl?

397
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,550
She did not appear.

398
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,230
It was an enclosure.
The broker was loaded,

399
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,710
so we do not know with
Who was negotiating

400
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,270
I do not want him to run away.
Save this

401
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,710
Very good.

402
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,350
It's dirty,
but there is no alternative.

403
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,470
It belongs to us.

404
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,790
The first play was ours.

405
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,230
If I do not cling to principles,
I could not believe in anything.

406
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,110
Clear.

407
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,590
Boggs saw the note together
to telf. of Farrow.

408
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,530
We thought that he could
being Mary Jane,

409
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,510
that had been
cited with Farrow

410
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,230
Why did not you notify?

411
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,470
It was just an assumption.

412
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,590
How they discovered it
the thugs?

413
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,380
They forced Burning.

414
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,790
What is this?

415
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,990
  You know
and we do not!

416
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,790
You call the stadium,
there is a shooting,

417
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,750
a man dies, there are cold cuts
All over Los Angeles!

418
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,110
And you are
in the front row!

419
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,070
You should have been there,
you had Farrow's note.

420
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,590
And what else?
You used us

421
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,110
- You know it.
-Do you accuse us?

422
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,230
- I would like it.
- If you played it again,

423
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,350
I warn you that I'm going
to make sweat blood.

424
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,630
Have you heard?

425
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,360
Yes, we have o dos.

426
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,130
If they find out about the hotel,
we are ready.

427
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,030
Yes.

428
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,950
We have to find
That fox before them.

429
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,870
Shoes seller,
kitchen piche ...

430
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,670
There is a lot of work
for ambitious young people.

431
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,390
- You take it with laughter.
- Do not.

432
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,430
Let me see it, I want to
check the other two names.

433
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,750
Come on.

434
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,470
Billy Bledsoe, Elena Could
and one Mr. Leroy.

435
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,710
Name (s.
Only names.

436
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,590
We will look at the telephone guide.

437
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,590
We have to find
That fox

438
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,990
So, when you're older,
You will know many things.

439
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,450
In addition, what will you do?
the day when the boys

440
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,510
go back to school?

441
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,310
No, I do not need a secretary.

442
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,710
But if ever
I need it, you will be.

443
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,550
My name is Boggs.

444
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,390
I wish you can see Mrs. Could.
Elena Could.

445
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,390
Can you tell me what you want?

446
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,230
I want to talk about Farrow
and Mary Jane Bowen.

447
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,030
Do you mind waiting, please?

448
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,060
No, for that you have
that put a tooth underneath.

449
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,790
Sure, you have to
put a tooth underneath.

450
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,350
Everybody knows.
More teeth, more pasta.

451
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,630
You can take it out with a thread
or with a pair of pliers.

452
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,340
There's no need, honey.

453
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,190
I love you too, but
It's harder for me to say, you know.

454
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,310
Tell mam  to call me.

455
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,310
Yes, look good.

456
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,180
Ok, honey.

457
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,630
Adi s.

458
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,350
Say?

459
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,470
Over here, please.

460
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,670
Boggs?

461
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,750
What name is that, brother?

462
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,070
- Irland s.
- Caf  irland s?

463
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,150
- More or less.
- It's fine.

464
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,390
Lester, bring chairs.

465
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,990
Sit down

466
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,150
Come on, be comfortable.

467
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,590
What can I do for you?

468
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,070
- I'll tell you.
-Direct to the corner.

469
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,510
Okay?
  Prepared?

470
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,950
Now.

471
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,790
- The girl wants to negotiate.
-When?

472
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,190
Tonight.

473
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,510
Warn the troop.

474
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,950
You take it very calmly.

475
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,630
Yes.
Is there something?

476
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,110
I have not found Bledsoe.

477
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,110
So I went to see
to Mr. Could.

478
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,880
What did he tell you?

479
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,550
A freak of
justice and equality.

480
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,750
No children, widow ...

481
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,230
It's in the North,
trying to recover Alcatraz.

482
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,870
That costs a lot of money.

483
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,510
Keep Mr. Leroy
and a house full of people.

484
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,190
What does he do?

485
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,950
He is a leader for his people.

486
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,870
And where do you go
to those happy people?

487
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,030
In La Brea,
between Watts and Belair.

488
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,550
Leroy: bald, wears glasses
of sun to be at home.

489
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,150
-S .
-S .

490
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,590
A heavyweight
Superstar of the ghetto.

491
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,470
- So ...
- So nothing.

492
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,150
Farrow made a decoration
or something like that for Mrs. Could.

493
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,270
Nobody heard about Mary Jane.
We're fine.

494
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,150
We do not have anything.

495
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,710
No customer,
no suspects, no clues.

496
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,590
There are no clues, nothing.

497
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,070
Why do not you know
Who has called?

498
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,350
-Who?
-Mary Jane

499
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,350
He wants to see us tonight.

500
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,070
She says she's scared
and wants to leave.

501
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,000
If we help her, we could
get the reward

502
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,190
- Damned if ...
- Exactly.

503
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,480
- Of course he lies.
-How did you know our number?

504
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,630
You can only know it by Rice,
so he already found it.

505
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,950
The black community does not try
become something different.

506
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,390
In fact, it is still psychologically
white in his behavior.

507
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,830
And for that, my leader,
our leader,

508
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,950
keep saying one
and again that black power

509
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,310
can not be jealous
of white power.

510
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,870
He has to be fed up with him.
I have to be ...

511
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,470
Remember, the fourth car will be
behind the door 32.

512
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,670
At the beginning of the eighth inning.

513
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,590
In the back seat.

514
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,070
Yes, she will be there.
In point, as they say.

515
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,520
Exact.

516
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,630
It has strained.

517
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,310
All your contacts have been
driven away by those stupid ones.

518
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,620
They are not stupid.

519
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,590
She will have to negotiate
at our price. Tonight.

520
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,580
I told you I would do it.
That bitch is desperate.

521
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,300
The desperate foxes
They are dangerous, brother.

522
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,220
Will work?
I'll send Phillippe.

523
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,300
Disguised.

524
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,230
We're here

525
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,750
Hey.

526
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,860
It's her.

527
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,270
Come on!

528
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,670
Hi.
Mary Jane?

529
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,510
Watch out.

530
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,630
Close the door!

531
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,110
Shut the door, idiot!

532
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,310
Five hundred cars here
plasters bastards give him to mine.

533
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,390
Well, eye for an eye.

534
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,550
- Go with Mary Jane.
-What?

535
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,790
It's Bledsoe.
The one we did not find.

536
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,220
I need a rev lver
bigger I do not give one.

537
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,420
What are we going to say this time?

538
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,470
This time we need
a lawyer.

539
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,390
That bitch has played it for us.

540
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,470
  S ?

541
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,510
Wait, wait a moment!
What are you talking about?

542
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,430
From Starsky and Hutch.

543
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,300
They just organized in the stadium
of the Dodgers. Another one dead.

544
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,920
We have got the money,
but not the girl.

545
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,440
The thugs have escaped.

546
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,790
And what excuse do they give?

547
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,030
They say the girl called them.

548
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,430
She said she would not appear
if he warned us

549
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,190
I want them made dust.

550
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,790
  By concealment of evidence
and criminal behavior!

551
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,200
  Mach cal the bones to both!

552
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,200
I'm going to call Sacramento
to denounce them!

553
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,990
They will take away the license,
I will tear them to pieces, lock them up!

554
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,900
   They have some proof
so I can help them?

555
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,470
From what I've heard,
the thing has become ugly.

556
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,630
- Get the test.
-  May I get it?

557
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,100
How much do you have to pay him?

558
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,070
They caught you with
hands in the dough.

559
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,510
Move some threads.
Does not he have any cane?

560
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,830
I'm a lawyer.
Not a magician.

561
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,870
- We will have judgment.
- Unless the charges are dropped.

562
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,830
I do not know.

563
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,670
What?

564
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,310
It's time to leave.

565
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,070
Leave what?

566
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,510
There's nothing to do
in this profession, Frank.

567
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,030
Nowhere.
Has no sense.

568
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,350
He is right.

569
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,350
A private investigator
It is no longer what it was.

570
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,590
With the latest legislation of
Sacramento two years ago,

571
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,710
you are not more than
process meat.

572
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,790
It does not lead to anything.

573
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,510
Of course, he drives
Four hundred of the big ones.

574
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,190
Well, we have to
find that bitch.

575
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,310
They are putting you
against the wall.

576
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,870
Yes. Well, this is called
"a strong offensive".

577
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,870
What are you going to do?

578
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,670
I will have to counterattack
and move on.

579
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,230
I'll see you after work.

580
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,590
Are you coming?

581
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,270
I will wait for you.

582
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,870
Yes, that's fine.

583
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,430
Things are improving.

584
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,150
And you call them soldiers!
You call them soldiers!

585
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,430
They have failed!

586
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,830
Two cars to the fucking shit!
They have failed!

587
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,430
Eliminated by two handicapped people.
Tell me, how is it possible?

588
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,550
Show me!

589
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,430
I want to know why they failed!

590
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,630
What is it?
   Stupidity?  cobard a?

591
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,550
Why the hell are you coming here?

592
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,270
For the music.

593
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,270
I think it
They have taken your beer.

594
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,710
Come on, I'm going to buy you a car.

595
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,710
First you were going to sell my house
and now you're going to buy me a car.

596
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,310
I'm going to buy you a car
if you forget the house

597
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,150
- It was a good house.
- Was.

598
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,350
It still is.

599
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,220
At least I do not know
It has fallen down a cliff.

600
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,920
Where are the papers
to be able to collect the insurance?

601
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,790
It's late, they've expired.

602
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,190
Timed out.
- Frank, Frank.

603
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,630
Listen out.

604
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,550
Everyone in this city
wants to finish with us.

605
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,670
We can not go worse.

606
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,790
Frank, do not you understand?

607
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:48,470
We went out in all the newspapers.
They are going to bury us.

608
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,470
One way or another.

609
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,830
Yes, it is here.

610
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,820
Edith is here.

611
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,990
It will go up right away
and then we will go.

612
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,510
Did not she get thrown out of here?

613
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,790
Someone owed him a favor.

614
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,030
Are you tough?

615
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,190
Thank you, Frank!

616
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,110
Muñerete

617
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,310
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

618
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,180
On the street.

619
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,310
Mary Jane does not
he will call again.

620
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,110
Why would he do it?

621
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,870
The bosses and us
we press it.

622
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,310
He does not want to be near
if any of us dies.

623
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,390
Sacrificed two intermediaries.

624
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,470
That means he had found
someone to sell.

625
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,230
Mary Jane had a lot of deal
with the brother of the? florist

626
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,750
The one in prison.
I'll go tomorrow morning.

627
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,470
- You're still without a car.
- Ya, I'll find something.

628
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,750
What are you going to do?

629
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,550
I'll start with the beach house.

630
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,630
- The last assault.
- That's.

631
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,620
Are you okay?

632
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,190
-What is this?
- It's a bullet.

633
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,510
I'll take it.

634
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,390
  S ?

635
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,190
Listen, the thugs have entered
in my house. They have destroyed it.

636
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,030
Also go for yours.

637
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,790
They were not looking for anything.
Bad business

638
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,550
They have destroyed it
just to get revenge.

639
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,110
They have been here.

640
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,940
Damn fans.
In the middle of the night.

641
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,800
He has come.

642
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,190
He says he wants to go home.

643
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,440
I think it is true.

644
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,270
But I also think that we
You owe a lot of interest.

645
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,710
I think he owes us a bonus.

646
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,990
We have to move forward in
the deal with Rice and the black man.

647
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,350
What are you doing here?

648
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,030
  Nyona is not here!

649
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,470
She is dead.

650
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:10,950
And you know.

651
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,070
I do not want to see you
around here never again.

652
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,350
You're a garbage!

653
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,800
Two years ago that
you are rotten   Dead!

654
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:32,030
I do not want to see your face ever!
  Never again!

655
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,670
- Come on kid.
- Come on.

656
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,240
- Come on, tell her.
- Come on, come on.

657
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,070
It has been missing!

658
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,750
-  Is everything ready?
- Yes.

659
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,470
Well, I do not want
that there are more failures.

660
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,760
Agree.

661
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,950
Are you okay?

662
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,030
Well, I've been in jail.
Burning came under the word.

663
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,750
Before yesterday a woman
He went to look for him.

664
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,030
Firm :
Mary Florida Burning.

665
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,750
Wife.
Bingo.

666
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,430
I took his address
to the official.

667
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,470
So let's go.
Get up.

668
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,710
Get up.

669
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,470
I know you want the thugs.

670
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,670
We will find the woman.
They will not be far away.

671
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,150
Damn, they're not coming here.

672
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,950
It is an occasion.

673
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,230
Our occasion.

674
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:41,550
Okay, you quit.
Great.

675
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,630
Sit and spin around here.

676
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,350
You have chosen a good place.

677
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,220
At least, here
we will not stay dry.

678
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,630
Bob.

679
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,670
Put me a drink, please.
I will accompany my friend.

680
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,620
Oh, Frank.

681
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,390
Frank, you can not
leave me in the lurch.

682
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,950
They are going to bury us.

683
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,590
Only because you can not
get out of your head

684
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,140
to that stupid
and pitiful bitch.

685
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,870
And you're the one who says it.

686
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,790
You can stay here,
because I go for them.

687
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,470
I want twenty-five thousand.

688
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,950
If you want, you can stay
ah  sitting forever.

689
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,300
But you can not make her come back.

690
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,430
To the,

691
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,550
the only thing you can do is

692
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,790
Try to get over it.

693
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,750
Try it.

694
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,190
Now I'm going to go out there
and I'm going to catch them.

695
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,550
Tell me where you are.

696
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,750
Tell me where you are
or I will kill you.

697
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,390
I will do it.

698
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,150
Do not get depressed, because
you will not get anything.

699
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,910
It is very difficult to carry a l o

700
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,760
of four hundred thousand dollars
from prison.

701
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,150
You did very well.

702
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,070
You still have Mary Jane.

703
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,350
It must be a woman's devil.

704
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,060
I killed Farrow because
He wanted too much chop.

705
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,470
Represent the show
until you left.

706
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,990
He is a woman devil.

707
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,150
They will process you, but there is no evidence.
They do not want to get dirty.

708
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:28,190
So maybe you're going home.

709
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,910
There are things that could
be much worse.

710
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,190
Pi nsalo.

711
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,710
Mr. Rice,
Greet Mr. Boggs.

712
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,990
Mr. Rice.

713
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,070
Mr. Leroy,
Greet Mr. Hickey.

714
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,190
So he fell off the cliff.

715
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,710
A pity.

716
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,150
My partner has
a bargain for you.

717
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,340
Magnificent house,
great neighborhood.

718
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,510
Esc chenle.

719
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,190
Do only what
Mr. Hickey tell you.

720
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:39,590
We are going to do everything as
It was planned, okay?

721
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,150
- All right, Mr. Leroy?
- Agree.

722
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,550
-Why is this place?
- We used to come here.

723
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,270
It's okay, come out and get ready.

724
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,510
Make them know how
if everything went well.

725
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,670
Take the bag.

726
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,590
Nobody has shown up.

727
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,430
Who cares?

728
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,430
Thank you.

729
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:17,230
There is no need

730
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,470
It still does not lead to anything.

731
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,430
I know, you already told me.
