1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,888
- Oh God
- Hurry!

2
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:16,086
Step on it

3
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:17,025
I can`t go any faster

4
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:20,166
Why not? I `ll kill y ou if you don`t

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,358
That`s the speed limit

6
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,662
You`re only going 60

7
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:26,136
You can go up to 160

8
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,075
That`s the radio

9
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,108
Radio?

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,647
Sorry, I `m short-sighted

11
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,807
- Just hurry!
- That way... by the bridge

12
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,016
- Go right?
- Yes, turn here

13
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:40,744
Hurry!

14
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:43,754
- What are you doing? Over there!
- Hurry!

15
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:47,317
You`re too slow! How many in your family?

16
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,519
- 8
- That many?

17
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:52,062
- Then they can do without you
- Hurry!

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,689
That way!

19
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,528
Big brother!

20
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:56,567
You too?

21
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:57,670
Boss!

22
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,171
You can join us if y ou do well

23
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:03,943
Over here!

24
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:05,934
Slowly...

25
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,136
Stop the car

26
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,839
That way!

27
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,541
That`s my big brother

28
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,380
- Good!
- Don`t forget your bag!

29
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:21,223
Better notify his family

30
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:24,864
before it`s too late

31
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:26,464
He has no family

32
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:30,095
Any relatives?

33
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:32,735
Can`t you save him?

34
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,602
Are you a doctor?

35
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:38,472
All I can do is reduce his pain

36
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,477
That`s all

37
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,013
Thank you

38
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:43,411
Good!

39
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:52,552
Wait!

40
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:55,286
That needle is too much!

41
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:57,157
I don`t have needles for humans

42
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,025
I `m a vet

43
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,658
Sorry!

44
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,133
There`s a hospital sign...

45
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:07,001
It says Pet Hospital

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,471
Moron!

47
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,576
- Sakuma
- Yes!

48
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:13,408
- Masa
- Yes!

49
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:15,412
- Aki
- Yes!

50
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,278
- Hiko
- Yes!

51
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:28,684
About the successor, I have to tell you

52
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:30,261
Yes?

53
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:34,026
Let my nephew take over

54
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,260
Where is he?

55
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:40,300
His name is...

56
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,045
Koizumi

57
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,379
Koizumi

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,750
No classes today?

59
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,828
Today is your father`s funeral

60
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:38,123
We plan to payour respects

61
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:39,265
Thank you

62
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,333
You`re alone?

63
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,500
I have no relatives

64
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,037
I`m like an orphan

65
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:49,903
What about your father`s colleagues?

66
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:52,603
I didn`t tell any one

67
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,579
He probably wants me to see him off

68
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:56,704
He must love y ou

69
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,286
Since my mother died

70
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,752
I`m not just his daughter

71
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,015
I took care of him

72
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,125
Like his wife or mother

73
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:11,356
So I`ll be there to see him off

74
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,641
Clasp your hands

75
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:31,102
"Sailor Suit and Machine Gun"

76
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,883
Brace yourself!

77
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,117
Work hard!

78
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,687
Come back to school soon

79
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:01,440
Thank s! You should be getting back

80
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,633
- Bye
- Bye

81
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,510
- Bye
- Bye

82
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,149
I`m all alone now

83
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,289
But...

84
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,883
That`s alright

85
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:08,238
Who are you?

86
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,200
Are you Koizumi?

87
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,305
Yes, I`am

88
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,678
My name is Mayumi

89
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:22,245
What do y ou want from me?

90
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:26,251
Can we go inside?

91
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,093
My father said
I`m not to let strangers in

92
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,331
I`m not a stranger

93
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,327
Takashi taIks about you all the time

94
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,640
Takashi?

95
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:45,233
Hoshi Takashi is your father

96
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,157
Nice place

97
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,107
Don`t touch that!

98
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:24,549
I don`t want strangers to touch it

99
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:35,825
Here...

100
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,854
What is it?

101
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,624
Read it

102
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,473
My father wrote this?

103
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:03,679
Dear Mayumi,
because I`m a traveling salesman

104
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:07,691
It`s highly likely I`ll get into
an accident

105
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:11,593
If anything happens to me, go to my house

106
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,962
and live with my daughter
Koizumi is strong

107
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:19,299
but she`s also very naive

108
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:24,775
With her you can share your views in life

109
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:30,247
Thank you for taking care of her

110
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:39,257
Bless you- Takashi

111
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:44,590
Excuse me

112
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,857
What is your relationship with my father?

113
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,873
Is it...

114
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:06,547
a male-female relationship?

115
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,550
To put it bluntly

116
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:20,426
Are you...

117
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,602
my father`s mistress?

118
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,059
Stop!

119
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,322
- Tomoo
- Yes!

120
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,832
- Leave quietly if you`re done
- Sorry

121
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:02,802
Make the nose higher

122
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,408
No, it doesn`t look like it

123
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:13,174
I can`t do it

124
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,617
You better go home

125
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,383
Look over there

126
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,425
Who are those men?

127
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,798
It`s dangerous!
Bullets may come flying...

128
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:39,372
Move away... back off

129
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,479
Please leave, it`s dangerous

130
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,946
Move away!

131
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,244
- Back off
-It`s scary!

132
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:47,375
Back off!

133
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,248
Hurry!

134
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,322
What are they doing?

135
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,720
Nobody knows! That`s what worries me

136
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,657
- Let me go in
- Stay back...

137
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:56,988
We`ll escort Izumi home

138
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,130
Use the back door

139
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,561
Alright...too crowded up front

140
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,689
No! I want to see...

141
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,597
- Stay back
- Don`t push!

142
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,601
- Where?
- Let me see!

143
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:09,901
This is the first time
I see the Yakuza at the school

144
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,011
We can`t take the back door

145
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,271
Hurry!

146
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:14,072
Koizumi

147
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,680
Hurry!

148
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,806
Koizumi come back!

149
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,214
Don`t go! Come back!

150
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,320
Koizumi

151
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:22,716
Hoshi

152
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,822
Hoshi

153
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,083
Hoshi

154
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,989
- Come back!
- Come back!

155
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,322
Hurry! Come back!

156
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:31,463
Hoshi

157
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,189
Hoshi

158
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,833
- Come back!
- Come back!

159
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,667
Hoshi Izumi?

160
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:16,608
We`re here to pick you up

161
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,611
Go!

162
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,116
- Move aside
- Open the door

163
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,813
Please go upstairs

164
00:14:58,411 --> 00:14:59,935
Gang of Medaka?

165
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,504
That`s the Yakuza

166
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:07,149
Gang of Medaka existed before the war

167
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:11,412
Nothing like the so-called gangs
these days

168
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,354
4th generation

169
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,393
Successor...

170
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,535
Hoshi Izumi

171
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,471
Excuse me...

172
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,204
My name is also Hoshi Izumi

173
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,313
Yes, that`s you

174
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,846
Please let me explain

175
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:48,185
My father is a blood relation?

176
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:55,096
Your father was named successor

177
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,733
We went through great trouble to find him

178
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:00,930
But he died in a car accident

179
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:02,700
We went to the crematory

180
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:06,107
and you were the only one there

181
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:08,338
That`s why...

182
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,881
- You chose me?
- Right!

183
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:15,314
If his nephew can`t take over

184
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:18,116
We were supposed to find his
lineal relative

185
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,918
Please accept...

186
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,023
Please accept...

187
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,360
Wait a minute!

188
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,400
You are...

189
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,266
You`re being reckless!

190
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,240
Listen to me

191
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:39,071
I`m an ordinary high school girl

192
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,304
Don`t worry!

193
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:45,440
Age and gender is not an issue

194
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,079
But...

195
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,816
It`s impossible!

196
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,450
I can`t do it!

197
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,587
I`m not capable...

198
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,789
There`s a first time for everything

199
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,866
You can earn your experience

200
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,571
What experience?

201
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:12,667
Fighting, gambling...

202
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,642
Murder? That kind of experience?

203
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:25,917
No way

204
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,487
I refuse

205
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,222
You must be kidding

206
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,111
You leave us no choice

207
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,641
We give up

208
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:57,317
This has turned into a farewell party

209
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,787
- Hiko, pass the wine
- Yes

210
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,016
Aki, get ready

211
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,717
We`ll settle our score with the
Matsunoki Gang

212
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:06,025
Before we disband, we must put on
a good show

213
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,690
- Prepare to die
- Yes!

214
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:14,169
Will you come to the farewell party?

215
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,542
But...

216
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,838
If you`re dismissed

217
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,108
Why do you still have to fight?

218
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,817
It`s the 4 of us against 40

219
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:33,319
There were a lot of you outside
the school

220
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:36,587
Big Brother found them

221
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,229
They`re on loan from other gangs

222
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:40,423
There`s only 4 of us left

223
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,833
It`s time to disband

224
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,606
Dismissed!

225
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,937
- Let`s go
- Yes!

226
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,240
Let`s do it!

227
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:57,110
- Wait!
- Let`s go!

228
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:58,681
Hold on!

229
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,887
Please wait!

230
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,654
I forbid you to fight

231
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,555
You can`t go!

232
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,092
This does not concern you,
you`re not the Boss

233
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,490
I...

234
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,029
I...

235
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,062
I accept

236
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:20,138
Miss...

237
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,172
That`s why...

238
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,833
I forbid you to fight

239
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:27,974
Miss...

240
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:30,976
Shall appreciate
if you address me as Boss

241
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,953
Boss!

242
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:41,656
Pass the wine cups

243
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,591
- Hurry!
- Yes!

244
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,981
That`s a hang over

245
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:08,551
Please, not so loud!

246
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,889
My head is pounding

247
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:15,086
I called in sick for you

248
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,660
Thank you

249
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:23,162
You made such a scene at the school
that day

250
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,633
Every one thought you have been kidnapped

251
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,175
You must eat!

252
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:36,509
Or your breasts won`t grow

253
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,507
They`re big enough!

254
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:44,883
You`re in a bad mood?

255
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:49,023
No!

256
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,290
I just don`t know

257
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,457
what my father saw in you

258
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,433
I`m curious

259
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:17,654
You`re not very pretty

260
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:20,283
and not particularly smart

261
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,986
In that case...

262
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:27,123
It must be your body

263
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,393
That must be it

264
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,264
I`m sure of it

265
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,682
You`re silly

266
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,277
How much did you drink?

267
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,289
Wine cups of this size

268
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,359
I had 5

269
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:58,496
I`m the Boss, I had to drink

270
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,556
You`re in trouble!

271
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:04,498
Gang of Medaka is a real gang

272
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,197
Yes!

273
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:12,176
You know about them?

274
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,676
Yes!

275
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:17,441
I heard of them in my degenerate days

276
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,647
I`m so worried

277
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,827
I`m sorry you had to do this

278
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,957
We have to say hello! Where are we going?

279
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,157
What?

280
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,325
Where are we going?

281
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,472
To meet with the Boss of
Gang of Hamaguchi

282
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:43,439
That`s the biggest gang in this
neighborhood

283
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,571
What a pain!

284
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:48,703
I don`t know any gang etiquette

285
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:53,674
I must not offend any one

286
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,985
All gangs have a front these day s

287
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:09,161
The boss is alway s a chairman of
some company

288
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:22,073
What`s on the roof?

289
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:24,114
Graves

290
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,523
Do we alway s have to wait this long?

291
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,120
Be patient!

292
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:42,199
We can`t survive if we offend them

293
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,392
Is the Boss in?

294
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:44,900
Please wait!

295
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:52,136
Who is that?

296
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,078
That`s Sekine of Gang of Matsunoki

297
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,075
Gang of Matsunoki?

298
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,442
Were you supposed to fight them?

299
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:04,385
They`re affiliated with the
Gang of Hamaguchi

300
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,923
That`s why they moved in on our turf

301
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:11,120
Is that Sakuma?

302
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,528
Long time no see

303
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,134
How are you?

304
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,064
Fine!

305
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:20,103
I see

306
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,402
This is our Boss

307
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:27,804
You must be kidding!

308
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:37,015
I `m the new Boss of Gang of Medaka!
Nice to meet you

309
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,291
Nice to meet you, listen to that

310
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:46,822
Are you running an amusement park,
Sakuma?

311
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,968
You expect this littIe girl
to run the gang?

312
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:54,929
Can`t even sell her to the bath houses

313
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:57,473
Go home and change diapers
Say that again!

314
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,742
You`re dead if you make fun of her again

315
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,710
Don`t get mad, Sakuma

316
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:05,248
I`m just kidding

317
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,187
Hey, look again

318
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:14,258
You`re quite cute!

319
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:16,057
How sweet!

320
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:20,453
- What the hell...!
- You little bitch!

321
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,395
- What the hell...
- Wait!

322
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:23,728
Sekine

323
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:28,738
Come see me. Also invite our guests
from Gang of Medaka

324
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:29,966
Yes!

325
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,440
I like you

326
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:44,645
You have guts and you`re cute

327
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,413
You deserve to be the Boss

328
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:51,386
I really Iike you

329
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,350
Boss!

330
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,200
Stop it!

331
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:07,930
Boss!

332
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,940
Gang of Matsunoki has taken over
our turf, I want it back

333
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:12,509
Is this for real?

334
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:14,077
This is a gift from boss of
Gang of Hamaguchi

335
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:15,941
This is great!

336
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,639
A toast to the Boss!

337
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,915
Dodge!

338
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:24,613
Here it comes again!

339
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,451
Are y ou alright?

340
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,623
We haven`t had so much fun
in a long time

341
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,991
I`m so happy

342
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,757
It must be hard on you

343
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:38,232
Don`t say that! This is a new beginning

344
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,838
- Exactly! Don`t cry!
- Boss!

345
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:43,237
Yes, this is a new beginning!

346
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,572
Attention!

347
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:49,545
Brace yourselves! Gangsters don`t cry!

348
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,774
Understand?

349
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,646
Yes!

350
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,419
Cheers!

351
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,583
What happened?

352
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,250
Machine guns

353
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:06,164
- Hiko, get the stuff
- What stuff?

354
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,958
Weapons!

355
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,623
Aki, get the weapons!

356
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:11,462
- Get it
- Sure!

357
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:18,836
Withdraw from school?

358
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:22,342
Koizumi

359
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,413
Koizumi

360
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,178
We`ll sign a petition for you

361
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:40,389
Don`t be discouraged!

362
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:54,439
Hoshi Izumi?

363
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:58,841
Yes, I`am

364
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,814
I`m Detective Kuroki from Shinjuku

365
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:07,316
- Police?
- Yes

366
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,421
- You`re here about y esterday?
- Yesterday?

367
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:16,030
No?

368
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,570
I`m here about your father

369
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,670
My father?

370
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,952
He was killed by a car at the airport
when he came back from a business trip

371
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:37,683
Is that right?

372
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:42,388
He was dead when the Police called me

373
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:44,518
Actually, I think he Iost control
of the car

374
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:46,893
and crashed into a tow truck

375
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,967
You`re saying...

376
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:54,230
My father is murdered?

377
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,701
- He work s for a trading company?
- Yes

378
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:01,506
- Does he travel much?
- All the time

379
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:05,412
Did he bring home any gifts?

380
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,677
Something about this big?

381
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:10,083
Like that? Did he have it?

382
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,712
No!

383
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:16,352
What are you trying to find out?

384
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:21,899
Most murder cases at the airport
involve smuggling

385
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,698
Smuggling?

386
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:33,303
You think my father is a smuggler?

387
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,680
That`s impossible! You must be joking

388
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,684
I apologize

389
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,518
We must check out every one

390
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,956
It`s not a popular job

391
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,561
Please believe me

392
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:53,892
- I don`t think your father is involved
- Goodbye!

393
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:57,899
I was at your house, there was a woman

394
00:30:58,036 --> 00:31:00,004
Who is she?

395
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:03,864
You mean Mayumi?

396
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:09,345
She`s a relative,
I`m afraid to live alone

397
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,611
Is something wrong?

398
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:16,152
I have seen her picture.
She`s wanted by the police

399
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:19,189
Her real name is Tsuchida Koumi

400
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:22,521
She`s wanted for theft, prostitution

401
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:25,721
Maybe I`m mistaken! Goodbye!

402
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,566
You gave me a scare!
I just arrived at the station

403
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:11,039
and I heard you called 110

404
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,205
Sorry!

405
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:32,663
My goodness!

406
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,698
This is the work of a professional

407
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,706
I don`t suppose you`ll find finger prints

408
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:45,036
What`s the name of that woman?

409
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,173
She`s gone

410
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:52,373
This is what I found when I came home

411
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,147
Strange! Is she really a relative?

412
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,554
She has a letter from my father

413
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:07,955
He wanted me to live with her

414
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:11,125
That`s weird!

415
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:12,702
Look at this mess!

416
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:15,431
They didn`t take anything,
isn`t that weird?

417
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,438
They`re not after money

418
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,771
CouId she have done this?

419
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:24,245
She must be looking for something

420
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:27,644
But she didn`t find it

421
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:31,379
If she did, she didn`t have to do this

422
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:32,581
Right?

423
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:36,251
You`re very sharp!
That`s what I think too

424
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:43,230
What are they looking for?

425
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:46,332
Perhaps...drugs

426
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,697
Drugs?

427
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:53,036
He`s just kidding

428
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,237
You`re scaring us

429
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:01,914
Sorry! I `m telling the truth

430
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:12,685
He`s probably jealous

431
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:15,959
and he lied! He wanted to kill that guy

432
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,960
He didn`t expect him to be a cop

433
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:25,232
- She`s so cute!
- Are you in love now?

434
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:27,436
Of course not!

435
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,774
- You`re blushing!
- Come here!

436
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:31,313
You`re serious?

437
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,781
- Who do you think you are?
- Come back!

438
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,011
What a fool!

439
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:39,590
Listen...cheer up

440
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:42,955
It`s frustrating to see you like this

441
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:46,192
- Have a drink!
- Come on!

442
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:48,628
No, they`re underage

443
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:51,362
You must drink!

444
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,265
Drink up!

445
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:53,371
Hurry!

446
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:54,472
Hurry...

447
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:55,698
Alright...

448
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,932
Good!

449
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,305
I`ll drink it

450
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:00,877
Excellent...

451
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,143
What did I tell you...

452
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:08,518
That hurts... I`m going to die

453
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:11,483
Like hell you are!

454
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:14,490
I`m still a virgin, I don`t want to die

455
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,355
Virgin?

456
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:19,622
I`m too far from that

457
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:20,423
Virgin?

458
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,225
- Over here!
- Aki

459
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,497
At the bath house when I was in
junior high

460
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,301
You`re weird! A fool

461
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,739
- Yeah!
- What about you?

462
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:32,843
You were a rapist

463
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,877
Shut up! How dare you make fun of me!

464
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,313
Don`t lose your heads

465
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,908
You ruined my mood! Really!

466
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,987
We`ll be careful

467
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:47,257
We have to go, Koizumi

468
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:48,381
We have to go!

469
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:49,925
Sure!

470
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:53,586
You can stay with me, I have extra rooms

471
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:56,392
No, thanks

472
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:57,865
Why?

473
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,664
No reason! I want some fun

474
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:02,797
I don`t want to be alone

475
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:07,378
If I`m alone, I `ll be bored to death

476
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:11,245
I`ll be like this...

477
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,349
For a girl

478
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:14,213
I don`t want people to see me like this

479
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:17,321
I see...

480
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:21,186
I don`t want you to know me

481
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:26,730
That`s the difference between the sexes
You won`t understand

482
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:29,323
Koizumi

483
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:33,435
Thanks! Good night

484
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,301
Good night!

485
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,735
Go home and get to bed, kid

486
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,278
You`re crazy!

487
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,442
- Hiko
- What?

488
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:48,882
Could you give me a ride on a motor bike?

489
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,884
Motor bike?

490
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:52,512
Let the wind blow away my troubles

491
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:54,090
Sure, no problem

492
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:58,321
Aki, the Boss thinks she`ll go crazy
tonight

493
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,793
What does that mean?

494
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,329
I don`t know!

495
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:04,765
Stop! It`s me!

496
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:05,835
You`ll get yourself killed!

497
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,234
Look! It`s me!

498
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,307
- How are you?
- Get down...

499
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:11,999
I need that

500
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:13,633
- Give me the bike
- Sure

501
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:15,507
Please get on, Boss

502
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:19,177
- Get her a helmet!
- Come on...

503
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,308
Here...try this!

504
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,251
Perfect!

505
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:24,980
Hold on! Here we go!

506
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,755
Move it!

507
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,381
- Let`s go!
- Move it!

508
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,251
I`m cold

509
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:38,554
Boss

510
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,361
Boss

511
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:42,933
What is it?

512
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,035
The rain on my back

513
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:48,195
My shirt is wet. I`ll catch a cold

514
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:50,597
It`s alright

515
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,201
It stopped raining

516
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:54,106
What? It stopped?

517
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:56,436
Yes!

518
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,572
It feels good

519
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:01,683
I`ll speed up

520
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,117
- Hiko
- Yes?

521
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:13,228
Why did you join the gang?

522
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:16,162
No reason!

523
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:22,199
You must answer me... in 100 words

524
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,139
I can`t find anything I want to do

525
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:31,648
I hate school... I hate work even more

526
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:36,413
It`s a natural move from the
motorbike gang

527
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:39,682
It`s the only way out

528
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:05,004
Here...

529
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:06,844
Is there any order to this?

530
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:08,383
Yes, red one in the middle

531
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,680
Red... red in the middle

532
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:12,987
Good morning!

533
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,182
- Good morning!
- Morning!

534
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,883
Morning!

535
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,220
What are you doing?

536
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:24,801
Redecorating for you

537
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:29,002
- Coffee?
- Yes

538
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,198
Here!

539
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:34,643
Aki did this, Boss! He has good taste

540
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,269
Excellent...

541
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:41,249
I used to be a painter

542
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:46,456
We have money to renovate?

543
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,151
Thanks to you, we`re making money

544
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:52,489
Your coffee, Boss

545
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:55,689
You want it here or at your desk?

546
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:01,398
Enjoy your coffee, Boss

547
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:02,437
Come!

548
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,670
Milk, Boss?

549
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:12,305
Please!

550
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,479
Where is Hiko?

551
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,284
You don`t know where he is?

552
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:23,018
I haven`t seen him
since he took me home last night

553
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:24,458
He`s like a bullet

554
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,290
He doesn`t come back

555
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:27,898
I`ll get it

556
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:30,731
Hello?

557
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,009
Hello?

558
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,308
Who was it?

559
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:42,639
Some man

560
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,305
- He said the goods are on the stairs
- What goods?

561
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:46,916
- I`ll check
- Alright!

562
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:49,218
Here you go, Boss!

563
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:51,784
I don`t suppose it`s a bomb

564
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:55,893
- After the machine gun?
- I don`t think so

565
00:41:58,763 --> 00:41:59,525
Aki

566
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:01,296
Hiko

567
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:02,992
Hiko

568
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,729
Aki

569
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,130
Gang of Matsunoki did this!

570
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:14,310
The shootout was a warning.
Now he killed us one by one

571
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:19,640
Hiko, we`ll avenge you

572
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:24,851
Shooting at us on our turf

573
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:29,592
and now they killed one of us!

574
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,888
I`ll handle this

575
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,897
I can`t just stand by and watch!
This is not a joke

576
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:39,025
Boss...

577
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,068
Why are you acting like this?

578
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,573
Stop yelling! Don`t you ever listen?

579
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:44,970
Boss...

580
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,703
Damn! This is messed up!

581
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:49,938
Boss...

582
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:51,281
Boss...

583
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:53,843
Boss...

584
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:57,343
- Wait!
- What are you doing?

585
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:58,651
Let me go!

586
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,154
- Boss...
- Let go of me

587
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,223
Boss!

588
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,486
You have a lot of nerve

589
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:11,667
I hope to talk to you as one boss
to another

590
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:18,205
One of my men was killed

591
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:21,302
You know about this?

592
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,437
Yes

593
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,340
That`s why I`m here

594
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:33,221
I believe you`re behind this

595
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:37,924
Cut this nonsense!

596
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:44,058
Listen to me, littIe girl

597
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:47,671
I ordered the shooting

598
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:49,066
But...

599
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:51,766
since the chief gave his order

600
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:55,709
We laid off you and your men

601
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,807
The cops are watching

602
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:03,409
Giving me a lot of trouble

603
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,215
Do you understand?

604
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:11,185
Yes!

605
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,800
I just want to make sure

606
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:20,164
Goodbye!

607
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:22,636
Wait!

608
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:26,876
Teach this naive little girl
a good lesson

609
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,376
Yes, sir!

610
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:31,777
Come on!

611
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,076
Come here!

612
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:35,481
- Come here!
- Quiet!

613
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:37,679
Move it!

614
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:50,499
Your clothes are dirty

615
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,105
Up to her head!

616
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:04,774
How`s the water temperature?

617
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,008
I `d like to take a bath too!

618
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,948
Hello? Sekine speaking!

619
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:13,481
What? You have Akira?

620
00:45:14,058 --> 00:45:16,458
Help me, Father!

621
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:20,127
If there`s even a scratch on my Boss

622
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:22,765
your idiotic son is history

623
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:24,764
Tell him again!

624
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:26,893
Father!

625
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:29,699
Don`t die on me! I need you

626
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:31,233
Say it...

627
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:37,276
Help!

628
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:38,973
Stop!

629
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:40,378
The Boss says to stop

630
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:41,450
Stop it!

631
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,109
Hold it!

632
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:44,721
Let her down!

633
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,817
Hurry!

634
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,625
Put her down!

635
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:57,968
Have you heard of Fatso?

636
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:00,999
Fatso?

637
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:05,742
His real name is Sandaiji Ichi,
another Yakuza boss

638
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:09,143
What about him?

639
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:13,509
Only he`s capable of such brutality

640
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:19,313
But why?

641
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,151
For drugs

642
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:29,856
Fatso is alway s into big drug deals

643
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:35,429
I think he`s after your father`s drugs

644
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:40,942
He turned your flat upside down
and couldn`t find it

645
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:44,013
So he tortured Hiko

646
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:53,187
But I don`t have any drugs

647
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:55,121
It should be there

648
00:46:55,793 --> 00:47:00,560
Or else Fatso won`t be involved

649
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:05,694
Boss

650
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:10,473
You must be careful

651
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:13,805
Don`t do anything reckless

652
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,274
Reckless?

653
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:19,780
For example going to
Gang of Matsunoki alone

654
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:26,152
I did it for Hiko

655
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,518
Someone killed him

656
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:30,286
- Aren`t you upset?
- Of course I`am

657
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:34,427
But that`s different for me

658
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:40,602
No one can replace y ou

659
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:43,773
You`re heartless!

660
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:49,938
I can`t believe you`re Iike this

661
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,292
Hello?

662
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:54,664
Hoshi residence

663
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,039
Who is this?

664
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:04,271
Koizumi?

665
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:10,517
Speaking

666
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:14,891
It`s me, Mayumi

667
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:21,694
Long time no see! I don`t know
what to say

668
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,958
How are you?

669
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:26,169
I`m fine

670
00:50:26,303 --> 00:50:30,706
Good!

671
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:38,376
Did you want something?

672
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:43,682
I ran into a bit of trouble

673
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:48,992
You must wonder why I disappeared

674
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:51,686
That`s why I`m calling

675
00:50:52,196 --> 00:50:54,858
You seem to be doing alright

676
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:01,771
Not really

677
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:08,435
Nothing is going the way I want

678
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,206
Really?

679
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:13,306
You sound depressed
