2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,010
Oh, God...

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,350
Come on, step on it!

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,220
I can't go any faster!

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,430
Bullshit! Speed up or you're dead!

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,060
This is as fast as it goes!

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,440
This is? You're only doing 60.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,520
Your speedometer goes up to 160.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,230
That's the radio, brainiac!

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,400
Radio?

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,240
I'm shortsighted, you see.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,330
Anyway, never mind that! Just hurry up!
That way! Towards the bridge!

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,120
- Right?
- Yes! Turn here!

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,750
Right! Come on, turn!

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,040
What are you doing?

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,630
Get moving! Now! You're so damn slow!

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,000
- How big's your family?
- Huh?

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,210
- How many people?
- Eight.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,550
Eight? They can do without you, then.

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,970
Come on, hurry up.

21
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,890
I said, hurry up! That's it, through here.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,850
Brother!

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,020
- Now you say it, too.
- Brother!

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,440
That's it, very good.
Maybe you can join us.

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,650
Alright, stop. Stop, I said!

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,610
That's him, over there.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,030
Alright, here we are!

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,610
Don't forget your bag!

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,540
It might be best to notify his family.

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,210
Though they likely
won't get here in time...

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,790
He has no family.

32
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,380
Any relatives?

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,260
Can't you save him?

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,630
Aren't you a doctor?!

35
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,340
All I can really do is reduce his pain...

36
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,510
Then do that.

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,720
Of course.

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,320
Hold on a second.

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,490
That needle's ridiculous!

40
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,110
I don't have any for humans.

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,820
- I'm a vet.
- Wha?

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,070
Sorry!

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,240
Hospital!

44
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,450
It said "hospital" on the sign!

45
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,620
Yes, "animal hospital"...

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,830
Moron!

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,500
- Sakuma.
- Yes, boss?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,340
- Masa.
- Boss!

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,800
- Mei.
- Yes?

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,130
- Hiko.
- Yes!

51
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,850
I need to talk to you about my successor
as head of the Medaka Family.

52
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,020
Yes, boss?

53
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,820
Let my nephew take over.

54
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,030
Where is he?

55
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,700
His name is...

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,290
<i>These aren't tears.</i>

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,630
<i>ALL this is.</i>

58
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,090
<i>Is where the fickle rain.</i>

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,470
<i>Has wet my cheeks a little.</i>

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,980
<i>This is Algeria, at the end of the earth.</i>

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,740
<i>And in the casbah night.</i>

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,280
<i>The flower will bloom regardless.</i>

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,200
Izumi!

64
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,580
- Izumi!
- Izumi!

65
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,670
What are you doing here?
Don't you have class?

66
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,210
Who cares about class?
It's your dad's funeral.

67
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,090
We wanted to pay our respects.

68
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,090
- Thank you.
- Huh? Is it just you here?

69
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,550
I don't have a single relative.

70
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,180
And now I'm an orphan!

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,810
What about your dad's
friends and colleagues?

72
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,810
I didn't tell anyone.

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,650
I wanted to see him off to heaven
by myself.

74
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,070
You really loved him, huh?

75
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,990
Well, to tell you the truth,
ever since Mom died,

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,280
I was like his daughter, wife,
and mother, all rolled into one.

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,370
So I wanted to take good care of him,
right until the very end.

78
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,580
Please place your hands together
in prayer.

Hang in there, okay?

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,020
Thanks! You guys should go
back to school now.

88
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,900
- See you later.
- Bye!

I'm all alone now.

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,910
But

99
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,410
I'll be okay.

100
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,340
Who are you?

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,340
Are you Izumi?

102
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,430
Yes, Izumi Hoshi. Why?

103
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,600
My name is Mayumi. Nice to meet you.

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,650
Can I help you?

105
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,520
Can we go inside?

106
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,280
My father said I'm not to let strangers in.

107
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm not a stranger.

108
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,200
Takashi talked about you all the time.

109
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,580
Takashi?

110
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,000
Takashi Hoshi. Your dad.

111
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,190
Nice place.

112
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,240
Don't touch that!

113
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,080
I don't want a stranger touching that.

114
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,840
Here.

115
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,760
What is it?

116
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,600
I'd like you to read it.

117
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,860
My dad wrote this?

118
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,500
"Dear Mayumi, since I have to travel
overseas with my company,"

119
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,000
"there's always a risk
I'll have some kind of accident."

120
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,420
"Should the worst happen, I ask that you
go and live with my daughter, Izumi."

121
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,760
"Izumi is a strong, sensible girl,"

122
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,720
"but she's also very naive."

123
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,600
"Getting to know you will open up
her outlook on life,"

124
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,520
"which is what she needs.
Please take good care of her."

125
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,200
"May you also be blessed
with happiness."

126
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,780
"Forever yours, Takashi."

127
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,910
Excuse me,

128
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,880
but what was your relationship
with my father?

129
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,090
Was it

130
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,390
you know, like a man-and-woman thing?

131
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,030
To put it bluntly

132
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,740
are you

133
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,540
my father's mistress?

134
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,650
This blows!

135
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,690
- Tomoo!
- Yes, sir?

136
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,530
Leave quietly if you don't want to paint.

137
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,070
Sorry, sir.

138
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,950
Shouldn't the nose be a bit bigger?

139
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,710
That looks nothing like her!

140
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,590
You're right, it does
look nothing like her.

141
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,090
Alright, that's enough for me.
I'm going home.

142
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,510
Hey, Izumi! Look!

143
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,930
- Who are they?
- What are they doing?

144
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,190
It's dangerous here!
What if one of them shoots at us?

145
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,190
Everyone, get back!

146
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,160
Can't you hear me?

147
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,490
- Out of the way!
- Stay back!

148
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,540
What do they want?

149
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,420
Nobody knows! That's the weird thing.

150
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,460
Let's go! We're late already.

151
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,590
Alright! We'll escort Izumi home.

152
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,170
Through the back gate?

153
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,010
What else can we do?

154
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,380
I don't want to go that way!

155
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,680
What way do you want to go?

156
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,350
That way.

157
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,850
That way?

158
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,310
It's too dangerous!

159
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,310
This is our school, isn't it?

160
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,150
Why should we have to sneak
out the back?

161
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,900
Hey, Izumi!

162
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,980
- Wait up!
- Stop right there!

163
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,190
Get back here!

164
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,240
Turn around this instant!

165
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,620
Izumi Hoshi!

166
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,990
Come back here!
Leave through the back gate!

167
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,960
Listen to your teachers!

168
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,830
Izumi Hoshi.

169
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,370
Correct?

170
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,750
We're here to pick you up.

171
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,140
Go on.

172
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
Excuse me.

173
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,410
Go on up.

174
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,330
Go on!

175
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,020
The Medaka Family?

176
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,020
Is that the yakuza or something?

177
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,940
The Medaka Family has
an honorable history

178
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,030
that goes back to the days
before the war.

179
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,740
Don't think we're like the scum
you see these days.

180
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,540
"Fourth Chairman:."

181
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,540
"Izumi Hoshi."

182
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,170
Um...

183
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,180
That's the same as my name.

184
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,260
It's you.

185
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,470
Allow me to explain.

186
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,030
So, my father had Medaka blood,

187
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:56,080
and the previous chairman named him
as his successor? But then...

188
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,750
We finally found Takashi Hoshi only
to discover he'd died in a car accident.

189
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,830
So we went to the crematorium, and saw
a sweet young girl in a sailor suit.

190
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,630
And that

191
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,010
was me?

192
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,170
Right.

193
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,340
The previous chairman instructed that,
failing the nephew,

194
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,050
we should find the next in line.

195
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,140
- At your service, boss.
- Chairman.

196
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,440
Chairman.

197
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,610
Wait a minute! Hang on!

198
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,320
This is absurd!

199
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,570
Listen.

200
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,410
I'm a high school student.
And I'm a girl, too!

201
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,950
Don't worry about that.

202
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,790
There are no rules on the chairman's
age or gender.

203
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,340
But...

204
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,550
This won't work!

205
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,590
I can't do it!

206
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,970
It's a whole different world.

207
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,970
Everyone's a beginner at some point.

208
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,730
You'll build up experience.

209
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,940
Experience of what?

210
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,110
Fighting?

211
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,070
Gambling?

212
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,700
Murder?

213
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,120
That kind of experience?

214
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,330
No way.

215
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,880
I refuse.

216
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,260
You must be kidding.

217
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,520
You leave us no choice.

218
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,440
I guess we have to give it up.

219
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,650
This has turned into a farewell party.

220
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,120
- Hiko, get the sake.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,370
Mei, prepare for a raid.

222
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,080
Are we going after the Matsunokis?

223
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,210
If we're going to disband, we need
to at least go out with a bang.

224
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,370
Gentlemen!

225
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
- You'll die fighting with me, right?
- Yes!

226
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,460
You'll come to the farewell party
at least, won't you?

227
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,260
But...

228
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,300
If you're going to disband,

229
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,310
why do you have to fight?

230
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,350
It's the four of us against forty of them.

231
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,400
Weren't there dozens of you
at the school gates?

232
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,820
Oh, my brother just hired them
for the day.

233
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,280
They're from other families.

234
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,160
The Medaka Family is just us four.

235
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,330
Alright, let's make this official.

236
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,490
Yes, Brother.

237
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,330
- Dismissed!
- Brother!

238
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,000
- Let's go!
- Alright!

239
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,920
Let's do this!

240
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,340
Wait!

241
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,640
Please, wait!

242
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,020
I forbid you

243
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,230
to go and fight!

244
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,190
What's it got to do with you?
You're not the boss!

245
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,480
I

246
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,150
I accept your offer.

247
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,240
Miss...

248
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,410
Therefore,

249
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,620
I forbid you to go on this raid.

250
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,290
Miss...

251
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,420
That's "Boss" to you.

252
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,460
- Boss!
- Boss!

253
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,140
- Get the sake cups! Now!
- Yes!

254
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,820
You're totally hungover!

255
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,330
Please, not so loud!

256
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,910
My head's pounding.

257
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,920
I called in sick for you.

258
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,840
Thanks.

259
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,510
You made such a scene at the school,

260
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,130
they thought you'd been kidnapped
by the gangsters.

261
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,140
You need to eat something.
If you don't get proper nutrition,

262
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,730
your breasts and your hips
won't develop.

263
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,360
My breasts are big enough, thanks.

264
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,950
What's the matter? Have I done
something to offend you?

265
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,830
No.

266
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,710
I just don't know

267
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,080
what my father

268
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,250
saw in you.

269
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,100
You're not especially pretty.

270
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,570
Nor do you seem particularly smart.

271
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,570
In which case,

272
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,240
it must be

273
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,950
your body!

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,880
You're silly.

275
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,510
Just how many drinks did you have?

276
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,810
I had about five cups of sake
around this big.

277
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,900
I'm the boss, I had to drink.

278
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,480
You're in trouble!

279
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,990
The Medakas are real yakuza,
you know?

280
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,320
Is that right?

281
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,410
You know about them, Mayumi?

282
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,950
Yes,

283
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,710
I heard of them back
in my degenerate days.

284
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,790
I'm worried about you.

285
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,890
Sorry to drag you out like this, Boss.

286
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,680
So who are we going to introduce me to?

287
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,850
Pardon?

288
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,430
Where are we going?

289
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,520
To see the Hamaguchi Family's
chairman.

290
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,570
They're the biggest family in the area.

291
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,940
What a pain!

292
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,360
I don't know any yakuza etiquette.

293
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,700
"It's an honor to meet you, sir!"
Like that, right?

294
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,170
All yakuza have a front these days.

295
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,090
Every chairman is the president
of some company or other.

296
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,770
What's that on our roof?

297
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,440
Graves.

298
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,620
Do they always keep you
waiting this long?

299
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,080
Be patient!

300
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,080
If we offend them, we're done for.

301
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,920
Is the boss in?

302
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,670
Yes, please wait just a moment.

303
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,130
They look scary! Who is he?

304
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,140
That's Sekine, the Matsunoki chairman.

305
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,640
The Matsunokis?

306
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,810
Weren't they the ones
you were going to fight?

307
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,350
They're affiliated with the Hamaguchis.

308
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,810
That's why they're infringing
on our territory.

309
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,950
That you, Sakuma?

310
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,870
Hello.

311
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,700
How's business?

312
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,290
- Can't complain.
- Really?

313
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,750
This is our fourth chairman.

314
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,750
Stop pulling my leg!

315
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,390
I'm Izumi Hoshi, fourth chairman
of the Medaka Family.

316
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,100
Nice to meet you.

317
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,390
"Nice to meet you"? Get a load of her!

318
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,940
What is this, an internship?

319
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,520
Huh, Sakuma?

320
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,030
You expect this little girl
to run your family?

321
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,570
You couldn't even sell her
to a bathhouse.

322
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,280
Go home and change your diaper!

323
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,450
Say that again.

324
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,080
Insult our chairman again
and you're dead.

325
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,080
Whoa, whoa! Easy, now!

326
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,500
Don't be like that. It's just a joke.

327
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,550
Now I look more closely, though,

328
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,590
don't you have a pretty little face?

329
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,260
I could just eat you up!

330
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,430
You little bitch!

331
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,060
<i>Hold it!</i>

332
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,640
<i>Sekine!</i>

333
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,480
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

334
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,020
<i>And bring our guests
from the Medaka Family.</i>

335
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,230
Right away, sir.

336
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,530
Boss.

337
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,890
I like you.

338
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,470
You have guts, and you're cute.

339
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,020
I can see why you're at the head
of the Medaka Family.

340
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,900
I really like you.

341
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,240
Boss.

342
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,620
Stop goofing around!

343
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,000
Brother! Brother!

344
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,880
Are we really getting back the turf
the Matsunokis took from us?

345
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,130
It's a gift from the Hamaguchis
for the new boss!

346
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,710
This is great!

347
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,880
To the new chairman!

348
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,470
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

349
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,890
Move it! Brother...

350
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,050
Not again...

351
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,560
What's the matter with you?

352
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,690
We haven't had so much fun in years.

353
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,020
I'm just so happy!

354
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,980
I'm sorry things have been so bad.

355
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,610
Not you too, Brother!
This is a new beginning for the Medakas.

356
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,160
Exactly! So don't cry, Brother!

357
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,240
Yes, this is a new beginning!

358
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,700
Attention!

359
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,580
Cheer up, everyone! Yakuza don't cry!

360
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,080
Understood?

361
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,500
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

362
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,670
Good!

363
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,510
What's happening?

364
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,680
Machine guns.

365
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,390
What do we do?

366
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,470
Get the weapons, you idiot!

367
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Mei, get the weapons!

368
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,770
Now!

369
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,940
Brother!

370
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,440
Brother!

371
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,690
<i>I've been expelled!</i>

372
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,150
- Izumi!
- Izumi!

373
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,200
Izumi!

374
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,450
We've started a petition
to let you come back to school!

375
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,340
Don't let the bastards get you down!

376
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,600
Izumi Hoshi?

377
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,860
Yes?

378
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,690
I'm Kuroki, Shinjuku Police Department.

379
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,570
- You're a detective?
- Yes.

380
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,660
- Is this about what happened yesterday?
- Yesterday?

381
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,960
No?

382
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,340
I wanted to talk to you
about your late father.

383
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,170
My father?

384
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,640
He was hit by a truck at the airport
on his way back from a business trip?

385
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,900
That's what I was told.

386
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,150
He had already died
by the time the police called me.

387
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,410
Actually, it seems someone forced
his car into the truck's path.

388
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,580
You mean,

389
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,950
he was murdered?

390
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,880
- He worked for a trading company?
- Yes.

391
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,130
- Did he travel overseas much?
- All the time.

392
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,760
Did he ever bring home any souvenirs?

393
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,930
Like small packages, about this big?

394
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,100
No.

395
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,140
What exactly are you trying to find out?

396
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,980
Well, when there's a murder
at an airport,

397
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,150
in most cases, smuggling is involved.

398
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,110
Smuggling?

399
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,160
You think my father was a smuggler?

400
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,120
That's impossible! You must be joking.

401
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,880
I apologize.

402
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,130
It's just it's a detective job
to suspect everything.

403
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,880
It's not nice, I know.

404
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,220
I believe what you say about your father.

405
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,720
Well, I'll be going.

406
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,930
Oh, I went by your apartment,
and there was a woman there.

407
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,100
Who is she?

408
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,110
You mean Mayumi?

409
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,150
She's a relative.

410
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,580
It would be too lonely if I was on my own.

411
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,570
Is something wrong?

412
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,040
I've seen her before.
On a wanted poster, I think.

413
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,790
Her real name is Tsunemi Tsuchida.

414
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,830
She has a history of theft, prostitution,
shoplifting, you name it.

415
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,880
I'm probably mistaken.
Alright, see you later!

416
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,920
You gave me a scare!

417
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,960
I just got back to the station

418
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,050
and I heard you called the police!

419
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,470
Sorry.

420
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,950
My goodness!

421
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,700
This is the work of a professional.

422
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,000
I doubt they left any prints for us.

423
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,960
Where's that woman?

424
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,880
She's gone.

425
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,880
It was like this when I got home.

426
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,720
Strange. Is she really a relative?

427
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,190
She had a letter from my father.

428
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,810
Telling her to live with me.

429
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,440
Telling her to live with you?
It gets even stranger.

430
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,070
But why would they make all this mess
and not take anything?

431
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,030
They weren't after money.

432
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,080
Whoever did this,

433
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,000
they were doing a very thorough search
for something hidden.

434
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,290
But they didn't find it?

435
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,340
If they did, there would be no need
to turn the place upside down, right?

436
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,130
Very good! You're a sharp one.
That's exactly what I think.

437
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,100
What were they looking for, then?

438
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,100
Drugs, maybe.

439
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,440
Drugs?

440
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,650
It's just a joke.

441
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,150
He's teasing us.

442
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,660
Sorry, but this is no joke.

443
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,290
Your father was a drug trafficker.

444
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,550
Dad was?

445
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,470
I spoke with someone
from the Tokyo Police's narcotics team.

446
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,890
I asked him to check the files,
just to be sure.

447
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,190
They've had their eye on Takashi Hoshi
for a long time.

448
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,780
Should I continue?

449
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,490
Go ahead.

450
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,670
Actually, I better say no more.

451
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,800
It doesn't feel right.

452
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,470
Please carry on!

453
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,760
You don't need to pity me!

454
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,100
This is bad, guys! He's hitting on Izumi!

455
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,100
What should we do?
We have to do something.

456
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,150
I don't think it's anything
to worry about. He's a cop.

457
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,320
You're such a sucker. Cops are still men.

458
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,940
Which means he's a rival.

459
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,860
Any guy who tries to get near Izumi
is our enemy!

460
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,450
Take a closer look.

461
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,620
They're all friendly with each other!

462
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,960
Your father used his business trips
to bring drugs back to Japan.

463
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,460
There's no question that he did this
so that he could sell them.

464
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,630
Someone decided they wanted to take
these drugs for themselves,

465
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,510
and murdered him at the airport.

466
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,850
However, they couldn't find the drugs
either among your father's belongings

467
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,720
or at your home.

468
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,100
Do you know this for sure?

469
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,940
It's conjecture.

470
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,860
When you start joining the dots,

471
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,610
it leads to this conclusion.

472
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,570
You sound very sure of yourself.

473
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,740
Disagreeably so.

474
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm a disagreeable cop.

475
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,500
The kind of disagreeable cop
who won't shut up

476
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,170
when he knows his theories
are upsetting a young girl.

477
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,220
Oh! That smile says this is nothing!

478
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,930
You're a tough girl, aren't you?

479
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,470
I'd be lying if I said
this didn't upset me.

480
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,350
But I'm alright.

481
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,480
I feel like I can
get through this somehow.

482
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,350
That's good to know.

483
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,400
Hi!

484
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,610
Who are they?

485
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,820
Drunks?

486
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,860
Don't mind them. They're just my men.

487
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,610
Huh?

488
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,700
I forgot to say.

489
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,370
Izumi Hoshi, fourth chairman
of the Medaka Family of Kanto.

490
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,670
He got so jealous

491
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,300
that he said he was going to kill him!

492
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,640
He didn't expect him to be a cop!

493
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,480
"You're so cute, Boss! I love you!"

494
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,520
Shut your trap, asshole!

495
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,570
- You're blushing!
- Come here!

496
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,900
Are you for real?

497
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,280
- She's way out of your league!
- Come back!

498
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,450
What a fool!

499
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,330
Listen, you all need to brighten up!

500
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,500
Looking at you all glum like that
is a real buzzkill!

501
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,830
Have a drink!

502
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,290
No, they're underage!

503
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,260
You don't get a choice! Now drink up!

504
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,470
Hurry up! Take it!

505
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,930
- Alright, I'll drink.
- Good!

506
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,140
Just watch me!

507
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,890
That's more like it!

508
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,390
What did I tell you?

509
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,270
It burns... I'm going to die...

510
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,940
Like hell you are!

511
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,240
I don't want to die a virgin!

512
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,700
Virgin?

513
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,580
- Virgin? What a nostalgic word!
- Hey! Hey!

514
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,160
Go on, Mei.

515
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:16,500
The first time I went to a bathhouse,
it was my first semester at junior high!

516
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,340
You're weird! What an idiot.

517
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,130
You only got laid because you
forced yourself on someone!

518
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,050
- You little prick!
- Hey! Hey!

519
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,010
You guys can be so brash sometimes.

520
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,220
You're even spoiling the mood for me.

521
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,640
We'll be more careful from now on.

522
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,940
Izumi! We're going to call it a night now.

523
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,600
You are?

524
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,270
Stay at my place if you want.
I have plenty of spare rooms.

525
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,490
I'll pass, thanks.

526
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,900
Why?

527
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,580
No reason in particular!
I just want to keep partying.

528
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,410
I don't want to be alone.

529
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,620
If I'm left by myself tonight,

530
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,960
I'll end up going crazy
and looking like this.

531
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,550
And girls don't like
to be seen looking like that.

532
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,050
I get it.

533
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,260
No, I don't want you to get it.

534
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,810
Men and women are different, you see.
You'd never understand.

535
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,810
Izumi!

536
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,570
Thanks! Good night.

537
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,400
- Good night!
- Izumi!

538
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,650
Night!

539
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,820
Go home, take a dump,
and get to bed, like a good kid!

540
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,240
Dumbass!

541
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,370
- Hey, Hiko!
- What?

542
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,790
- I want to ride a motorbike.
- A motorbike?

543
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,540
I want the wind to blow away
my troubles!

544
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,170
You got it!

545
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,670
Mei, Mei. The boss said
she'd go crazy tonight.

546
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
What does that mean?

547
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,300
I don't know.

548
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,930
Stop! It's me!

549
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,350
Hey, watch it!

550
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,180
Look! It's me!

551
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,810
- Hey! Are you well?
- Of course I am. Now give me the bike!

552
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,060
Sure, she's all yours.

553
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,690
Hop on, Boss!

554
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,440
Get her a helmet!

555
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,610
That'll do.

556
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,410
Perfect!

557
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,700
Hold on! Here we go!

558
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,040
- Let's go!
- Alright!

559
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,770
I'm cold!

560
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,770
Boss!

561
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,940
Boss!

562
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,780
What?

563
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,070
I think I felt the rain on my back.

564
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,820
You'll catch a cold hanging on to me.

565
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,540
It's alright.

566
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,120
It stopped raining.

567
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,710
What? It stopped?

568
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,420
Yes!

569
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,500
This feels great!

570
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,090
I'll speed up, then!

571
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,600
- Hiko.
- Yeah?

572
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,890
Why did you join the Medaka Family?

573
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,060
No reason, really!

574
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,190
Yes there is!
Answer the chairman's question.

575
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,610
In 100 words or less!

576
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,700
There wasn't any line of work
I was suited to.

577
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,200
I hated school.
And I hated working even more!

578
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,460
After the biker gang, being a yakuza
was the natural next step!

579
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,210
What can I say? My career
was destined for great things!

580
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,860
- Over here, over here.
- Hey, Mei. Is there any order to this?

581
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,650
Yes, the red one goes in the middle.

582
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,820
Red one in the middle...

583
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,990
Good morning, Boss!

584
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,160
Oh, good morning!

585
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,370
Good morning!

586
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,040
What on earth are you doing?

587
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,840
We're redecorating so that you
feel more at home here, Boss.

588
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,300
- Coffee.
- Coming right up!

589
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,680
Boss!

590
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,850
Mei picked everything out.
Doesn't he have good taste?

591
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,350
Brilliant taste!

592
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,230
I used to be a decorator.
I just used what I learned from that.

593
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,530
We have money to renovate?

594
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,200
Thanks to you,
we're making more money now.

595
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,030
Your coffee, Boss.

596
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,330
Would you like it here, or at your desk?

597
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,750
Boss! Hey.

598
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,210
Try it out, Boss!

599
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,420
Would you like milk, Boss?

600
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,180
- Yes, please.
- Okay!

601
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,970
Wait, where's Hiko?

602
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,850
Huh? You don't know either, Boss?

603
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,940
I haven't seen him
since he took me home last night.

604
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,310
He's like a bullet.

605
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,070
He doesn't come back!

606
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,730
I'll get it!

607
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,070
Medaka Family.

608
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,570
Yes, that's right.

609
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,240
Huh?

610
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,160
Hello?

611
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,790
Hello?

612
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,410
What was that?

613
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,960
Some strange guy. He said,
"The goods are on the stairs."

614
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,420
What goods?

615
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,040
- Go check.
- Alright.

616
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,800
Here you go, Brother!

617
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,380
I don't suppose it's a bomb or something.

618
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,390
After the machine gun?
Too much of a step down.

619
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,850
Hiko!

620
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,890
Hiko!

621
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,060
Hiko!

622
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,690
The Matsunokis did this!

623
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,650
First the machine gun,

624
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,240
now they're taking us out one by one.

625
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,450
Hiko, we'll avenge you.

626
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,500
They shot at us on our own turf,

627
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,750
and now they've killed one of us!

628
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,720
I can't just sit back and take this!

629
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,890
I mean it!

630
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,050
Boss!

631
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:30,060
- Boss!
- What's all this racket?

632
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,190
Keep it down, will you?

633
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,020
That's very dear to me! Bastard!

634
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,190
Boss!

635
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,400
Boss!

636
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,860
Boss...

637
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,450
- Idiot!
- Boss.

638
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,830
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

639
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,990
- Boss!
- Boss!

640
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,670
You've got balls,
coming here on your own.

641
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:00,340
I want to have an honest discussion,
chairman to chairman.

642
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,760
One of my men was killed.

643
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,850
But you know that.

644
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,930
Yes. I do.

645
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,730
That's why I'm here.

646
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
The Matsunoki Family did it.

647
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,190
Damned imbecile!

648
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,860
Don't say such slanderous things.

649
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,120
Listen to me, little girl.

650
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,910
It was us who shot up your office, yes.

651
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,040
But after that, the head
of the Hamaguchis gave orders

652
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,760
not to lay a finger on the Medaka Family.

653
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,010
Any more incidents would get us
too much unwanted attention.

654
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,430
This is inconveniencing us, too!

655
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,850
Do you understand?

656
00:46:58,770 --> 00:46:59,860
Yes, sir.

657
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,150
I just wanted to make sure.

658
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,240
Goodbye.

659
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,570
Not so fast.

660
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,290
Teach this impudent little girl
some manners.

661
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,460
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

662
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,960
Pipe down!

663
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,000
Shut up!

664
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:39,190
Fourth Chairman!
Your clothes are all dirty!

665
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,610
Just dunk her up to her head already!

666
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,990
- Chairman!
- How's the temperature?

667
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,080
I'd like to take a dip myself!

668
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,160
Sekine speaking!

669
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,710
What? You have my boy?

670
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,420
Daddy! Help me, Daddy!

671
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,130
If there's so much as a scratch
on our chairman

672
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,720
your halfwit of a son is history.

673
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,800
Tell him again!

674
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,510
Daddy!

675
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,680
Don't die on us! We need you.

676
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,230
Here, talk to him.

677
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,320
Let me down already!

678
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,400
Stop!

679
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,150
Stop, stop!

680
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,490
Hey, the boss said to stop.

681
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,080
Stop!

682
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,580
- Stop!
- Bring her down!

683
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
Bring her down!

684
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,500
I'll move this.

685
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,210
- Okay?
- Yeah.

686
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,800
Well?

687
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,470
I think you've got a taste for
how fearsome the yakuza can be.

688
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,980
Yes, I was scared.

689
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,400
But it's only made me more determined!

690
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,650
Until we get Hiko's killer,

691
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,240
I won't stop fighting!

692
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,660
I was waiting for that!

693
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,370
You've got a pretty face, but that
yakuza blood makes you a fighter!

694
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,710
The girl's got spunk.

695
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,460
What's your problem?

696
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,720
I just don't think, as a girl, she should
be getting any deeper into this.

697
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,090
She's not a girl. She's the chairman!

698
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,430
Our brother's dead, and you want us
to lie back and take it?

699
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,810
But we had such a close call today!

700
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,480
We best make a grave for Hiko.

701
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,500
Boss, have you ever heard
of someone called Fatso?

702
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,460
- Fatso?
- Yeah.

703
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,300
His real name is Hajime Sandaiji.
He's the leader of another yakuza family.

704
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,170
What about him?

705
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,510
I can't think of anyone else
capable of such brutality.

706
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,520
But why?

707
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,100
For drugs.

708
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,940
Whenever a deal's going down,
Fatso is always involved somehow.

709
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,280
He's after your father's drugs.

710
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,160
But even after ransacking
your apartment, he found nothing.

711
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,000
So he tortured Hiko
to try to make him talk.

712
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,630
But there are no drugs!

713
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,050
There must be.

714
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,850
If Fatso's sticking his nose in,
there must be drugs somewhere.

715
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,980
Boss.

716
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,690
You have to be careful.

717
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,860
Don't do anything reckless again.

718
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,450
Reckless?

719
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,120
Like going to take on
the Matsunoki Family alone.

720
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,750
I did it for Hiko!

721
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,840
Don't you care that he was killed?

722
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,170
Of course I do!

723
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,720
But unlike me,

724
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,390
no one can replace you, Boss.

725
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,680
That's so cold!

726
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,730
That's awful!

727
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,980
So this is the kind of person
you are, Sakuma?

728
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,140
Leave me alone.

729
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,480
No can do, I'm afraid. Brother Sakuma
asked me to make sure you're safe.

730
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,730
I'm fine.

731
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,570
I'll walk you home!

732
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,260
Hello?

733
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,220
Hoshi residence.

734
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,770
Hello?

735
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,150
<i>Izumi?</i>

736
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,570
Yes, Izumi Hoshi speaking.

737
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,490
<i>It's me, Mayumi.</i>

738
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,790
<i>It's been a while, and I wondered
how you were doing!</i>

739
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,750
<i>Are you getting on alright by yourself?</i>

740
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,420
I'm fine.

741
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,880
<i>Good!</i>

742
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,300
<i>That's really good.</i>

743
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,180
Did you want something?

744
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:18,140
<i>Well, I'm surviving, I suppose.</i>

745
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,770
<i>I thought you must be wondering
why I disappeared so suddenly,</i>

746
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,400
<i>so I decided to give you a call.</i>

747
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,360
<i>But you seem to be doing just great.</i>

748
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,540
Not really.

749
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,920
I hate everything.

750
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,210
<i>Really?</i>

751
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,300
<i>So you're feeling down, huh?</i>

752
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,220
<i>I'd like to see you.</i>

753
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,600
<i>There's something I'd like to ask</i>

754
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,730
<i>your forgiveness for.</i>

755
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,110
I started hanging out in places
like this when I was in grade school.

756
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,860
My mother ran a bar,

757
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,360
so I became an alcoholic in junior high

758
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,200
and a junkie in high school.

759
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,620
When I got to college...

760
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,000
Yes, I went to college, believe it or not.

761
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,290
I majored in pharmacy,

762
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,000
because I thought I could get my hands
on anything I wanted.

763
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,380
But I was naive.

764
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,550
I ended up getting caught
stealing heroin.

765
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,760
That was my life over, there and then.

766
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,930
I had more men than I can remember.

767
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,390
Life was nothing but pain.

768
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,020
I was drunk and high
when I crashed my car.

769
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,070
It was raining so heavily.

770
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:56,330
Then a car came past, and the driver
saved me. I was half dead.

771
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,200
That was Takashi Hoshi.

772
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,370
He saved me in more
than one way, though.

773
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,420
Because it was only through meeting him
that I knew what love really was.

774
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,340
That's quite the story you've cooked up.

775
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,720
It's like something out of a novel.

776
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,770
You don't believe me?

777
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,940
I know your real name
is Tsunemi Tsuchida.

778
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,110
And you have a rap sheet.

779
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:34,610
For theft, shoplifting,

780
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,330
and pros...

781
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,200
Is that what they told you?

782
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,290
Yes, a detective did.

783
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,210
So, you think it was me
who tore the apartment up?

784
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,290
Wasn't it?

785
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,920
Is everything my fault now?

786
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:04,310
<i>These aren't tears.</i>

787
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:11,990
<i>ALL this is.</i>

788
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:20,330
<i>Is where the fickle rain.</i>

789
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:26,080
<i>Has wet my cheeks a little.</i>

790
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,010
<i>This is Algeria, at the end of the earth.</i>

791
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,590
My dad liked that song.

792
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,390
That's just a coincidence, right?

793
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,850
Right! Just a coincidence!

794
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,150
I'm leaving.

795
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,110
Izumi!

796
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,870
I've fallen in love with someone.

797
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,880
I thought Takashi would be the last,
but here I go again!

798
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,130
Can you forgive me?

799
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,300
Why do you need my blessing?

800
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,850
Because you're Takashi's daughter.

801
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,350
And I promised him I'd take care of you,

802
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,020
but then I went and fell
for someone else.

803
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,440
Mayumi.

804
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,360
You're such a liar, aren't you?

805
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,030
Drop the act!

806
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,990
Thank you.

807
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,620
<i>The woman from the tavern.</i>

808
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,880
<i>Puts on the pretense.</i>

809
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,680
<i>Of Love again tonight.</i>

810
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,590
I hate to treat such
a cute little chairman so roughly,

811
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,430
but if I don't, Brother Sakuma
won't see me.

812
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,060
What do you want with him?

813
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,020
It's not just him,
I have business with you, too.

814
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:55,480
So it would be convenient to have
the both of you together.

815
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,040
You want to kill Sakuma, don't you?

816
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,090
I know you have a gun.

817
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,510
It's purely precautionary.

818
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,550
People used to call him
the Killing Machine.

819
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,260
He's as quick as a snake.

820
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,390
Come on, let's go!

821
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,070
Tell Brother that Hagiwara's
here to see him.

822
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,950
Mayumi!

823
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,010
I didn't know he
was with the Medaka Family.

824
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,890
Though I did think
he was probably a yakuza,

825
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,850
what with the tattoo on his back.

826
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,320
It's disgusting!

827
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,780
You were like two beasts.

828
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,810
The heroin that was meant for Fatso

829
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,940
seems to have accidentally fallen
into the Medakas' hands.

830
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,860
Please hand it over.

831
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,110
I don't have it.

832
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,030
- Give it back!
- I don't have the damn stuff!

833
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,990
Fatso thinks you do.

834
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,830
- If you don't cough it up...
- I want to see Fatso.

835
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,700
Let me talk to him.

836
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,830
He won't see you.

837
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,620
Please, I'm asking you.

838
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,880
Don't ask me.

839
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,840
Ask your lady.

840
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,510
Lady?

841
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,310
The one you were just with, Brother.

842
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,360
You don't know?

843
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,610
She's Fatso's daughter.

844
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:33,820
She's his only girl, but she ran away
because she couldn't stand him.

845
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,040
If you bring her along,
maybe he'll see you.

846
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,210
Otherwise, you better find that heroin.

847
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,130
That's the only way
the Medaka Family is going to survive.

848
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,500
I see.

849
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:24,500
So she's this Mayumi you told me about.

850
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,500
She's a fake.

851
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,090
Most likely.

852
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,760
I just picked her up at a bar I always
go to without thinking about it.

853
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,270
She didn't tell you her name?

854
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,360
Isn't that what most people do when they
meet someone for the first time?

855
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,660
Most people, yeah.

856
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,490
And you're not most people?

857
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,710
I'm a yakuza. You know that.

858
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,380
We might talk like we're all righteous,

859
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,220
but we're rotten to the core.

860
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,850
You can hardly bear
your own putrid stench.

861
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:33,650
You have to deal with shit, and people,
even more rancid than yourself.

862
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:41,830
If you can't do that, it hurts too much
every time you go to bed at night.

863
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,290
Sometimes you want to howl, like a wolf.

864
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,880
You mean that she...

865
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,880
Mayumi is just as rotten?

866
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,050
No.

867
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,640
I don't know!

868
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,230
When I met her,

869
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,190
she told me I looked like her old lover.

870
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:18,160
"She told me I looked like her old lover."

871
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:22,990
That he was dead now,
but I reminded her of him.

872
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,410
"That he was dead now,
but I reminded her of him."

873
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:35,460
I was just a substitute
for the man she loved!

874
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:41,720
<i>"I was just a substitute
for the man she loved!"</i>

875
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,490
Morning!

876
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,820
- Morning!
- Morning, Boss!

877
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,200
What's today's schedule?

878
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,540
Well, patrolling our territory, as usual,

879
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,540
then in the evening, Mr. Hamaguchi
has invited you for dinner.

880
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,180
As in the boss of
Hamaguchi Enterprises?

881
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,350
Yes. You haven't exchanged sake cups
with him since becoming chairman,

882
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:06,510
so it's very important.

883
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,850
Exchanged sake cups?

884
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,020
Sounds like a wedding!

885
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,480
Well, it is a wedding of sorts.
Between two yakuza families.

886
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,780
So, where are we having dinner?

887
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,490
At Mr. Hamaguchi's house.
He asked you to come alone, Boss.

888
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:23,200
Alone?

889
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,910
Are you soft in the head?

890
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,450
I just mean, we shouldn't send
a girl the Boss' age

891
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,080
over there all by herself.

892
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,590
I'm the chairman!

893
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,670
What's age or gender got to do with it?

894
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,380
But, Boss, he's.

895
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,220
I'm going.

896
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,600
The chairman mustn't run away.

897
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,770
But Boss...

898
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,770
The thing is.

899
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:03,490
I'm glad you enjoyed dinner.

900
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:07,700
Dishes and dishes of food I'd never
seen before just kept coming!

901
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,700
I feel like I'm going to burst!

902
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:14,040
This helps with digestion. Try it.

903
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,670
It's delicious!

904
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,760
Really? I'm glad you think so.

905
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,300
That you're so politely
enjoying my hospitality

906
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,680
makes me feel it was worth inviting you.

907
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,310
Now we've had dinner together,

908
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,900
Hamaguchi Enterprises
and the Medaka Family

909
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,020
are properly allied, right?

910
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,740
Well, I'm not so sure of that.

911
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:49,320
We've yet to make this official,
chairman to chairman, I think.

912
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,120
Huh?

913
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,080
Now, let's go, shall we?

914
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,540
Yeah?

915
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,750
Go where?

916
01:10:58,830 --> 01:10:59,880
Well...

917
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,210
Come on.

918
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,760
- Stand up.
- No, thank you.

919
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,180
- Let's go.
- I wasn't planning on staying the night.

920
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,930
Besides, I don't have
my pajamas with me...

921
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:12,260
Come on. Don't worry
about your pajamas.

922
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,220
You can sleep naked.

923
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,650
Excellent!

924
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,650
So you are a virgin!

925
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,860
That's just perfect.

926
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:29,070
That means we can make
a proper alliance.

927
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,460
Come along. That's a good girl.

928
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,920
Let's go, shall we?

929
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,000
Okay? Come on, let's go.

930
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:43,170
Hey, now!

931
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,760
Come with me.

932
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,260
Hey!

933
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,590
Alright, let's go up now.

934
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,760
No!

935
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,470
That's it, on your feet now.

936
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,430
Okay, okay!

937
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,970
Oh, you're a feisty one!

938
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,020
What fun.

939
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,560
Up you go.

940
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,060
Keep going! Keep going!

941
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,370
Mr. Hamaguchi?

942
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,540
What?

943
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,870
A visitor.

944
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,710
I can't see them right now, I'm busy!

945
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:22,210
She calls herself Mayumi.

946
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,000
Mayumi Sandaiji.

947
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,300
She said to tell you
that she's Fatso's daughter.

948
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,470
What?

949
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,640
Just as I thought!

950
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,720
Get out, now!

951
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,350
- Mayumi!
- Sakuma's waiting for you outside.

952
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,270
What about you, Mayumi?

953
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,480
You're not going to let the both of us go,
are you, Mr. Hamaguchi?

954
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,820
If I'm going to let go
of a fresh young virgin,

955
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,990
I'm going to need
some serious compensation.

956
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,580
This is the kind of man
you're dealing with.

957
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,950
Do you see now?

958
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,580
Be more careful from now on.

959
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm sorry.

960
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:05,380
Go.

961
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,380
He's worried sick.

962
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,340
Sakuma is?

963
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,930
He's waiting outside

964
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:20,730
so he could come in and kill Hamaguchi
if he did anything to you!

965
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,150
He's such a fool.

966
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,110
A yakuza down to his very bones.

967
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,900
Go to him. Now!

968
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,280
My, my! This is one for the books!
The Sandaiji girl!

969
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,700
Who'd have thought the woman
I could never talk into bed

970
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,870
would end up coming running to me!

971
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:47,630
Just what does that virgin girl
mean to you?

972
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,130
I guess you could call it my duty.
I made someone a promise.

973
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,470
I can't let monsters like you hurt her.

974
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,100
That's all our relationship is.

975
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:00,930
Boss!

976
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:03,350
Boss!

977
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,020
Boss!

978
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,440
Are you alright?

979
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,610
Boss?

980
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,030
Boss! You're not hurt, right?

981
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:12,610
Boss!

982
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:15,910
Thank goodness.

983
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,070
Thank goodness.

984
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,880
I'm sorry.

985
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:37,930
Mayumi...

986
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,350
She sacrificed herself for me...

987
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,430
It's okay. It was her own decision.

988
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,940
Is it really, though?

989
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,070
Is that how men,

990
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,570
and women

991
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,790
are?

992
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,500
It's over now.

993
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:11,460
You're done dealing with him.

994
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,250
Coffee's ready.

995
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,490
Morning!

996
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,830
Good morning, Boss!

997
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,160
Good morning.

998
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,370
Boss,

999
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,290
shouldn't you rest up at home
a little longer?

1000
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,380
I'm fine.

1001
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,500
Are you sure?

1002
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,930
Oh, this is for you.

1003
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,600
What is it?

1004
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,940
Boss!

1005
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,860
The rice fish is cute, isn't he?

1006
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,620
- This one?
- No, over here.

1007
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,660
- This one?
- Yeah.

1008
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,500
And over to the right...

1009
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,620
That's it. A bit more Yeah...

1010
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:13,630
His name's Taro.

1011
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,170
Good morning.

1012
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:18,550
You see the little guy beneath him?
That's the one.

1013
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,630
He doesn't move much, does he?

1014
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:24,090
- I wonder if something's wrong with him.
- Maybe.

1015
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,680
The most energetic one...

1016
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,600
A bit lower. More. Lower. Lower.

1017
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,270
There! He's the liveliest.

1018
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,770
I'm being tailed.

1019
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,940
- What?
- Huh?

1020
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,150
I've felt like someone's
been following me all morning.

1021
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,860
Following you?

1022
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,450
It's freaking me out.

1023
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,300
Detective?

1024
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,170
I knew it was you!

1025
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:05,260
You had a chat with the boss
in that underground cafe, didn't you?

1026
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,350
I saw you.

1027
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:09,600
Who the hell are you?

1028
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:12,600
I'm Mei, from the Medaka Family.

1029
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:16,440
I'm the boss' bodyguard.
Good to meet you.

1030
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:20,110
Do you have something
to discuss with the boss?

1031
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:24,070
Did you find Hiko's killer?

1032
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,410
Sorry, but that case is a dead end.

1033
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,830
There are no leads whatsoever.

1034
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,750
So what do you want
with the boss, then?

1035
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,670
What's this?

1036
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,000
Are you interrogating me?

1037
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,130
I'm the detective here!

1038
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:48,760
Sakuma told me not to let
anyone suspicious go inside.

1039
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,140
Suspicious?

1040
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,890
What's suspicious about me? Huh?

1041
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,480
What's so suspicious about me?

1042
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,570
Tell me.

1043
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,660
What is it?

1044
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,830
Aren't you meant to be a cop?

1045
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:16,210
Is this how you protect your boss?

1046
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,210
What a joke.

1047
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,710
It's my business what I want with her.

1048
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,300
I need to speak with her.

1049
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,760
In person.

1050
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,180
You got a problem with that?

1051
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:32,930
Punk!

1052
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,220
Speak up!

1053
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,520
Sorry.

1054
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:42,770
I'm in a bad mood today!

1055
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,280
And I'm feeling pretty impatient.

1056
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,570
Wait!

1057
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,960
You're not seeing the boss.

1058
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,920
There's no way I'd let
a son of a bitch like you up there!

1059
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,390
Not to see our chairman!

1060
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,560
You want to die?

1061
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,230
Don't struggle.

1062
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,480
Don't move, or you're dead.

1063
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:32,700
Fine.

1064
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,540
I'll arrange to see your boss
another time.

1065
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:02,060
No...

1066
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:06,440
Something bad's going to happen, Boss!

1067
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,860
Did you get into another fight?

1068
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,370
Who did this to you?

1069
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,000
This is bad...

1070
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,790
You must be in pain!

1071
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,040
It's bad...

1072
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:30,470
You know a cop called Kuroki, right?

1073
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,720
Mr. Kuroki?

1074
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,390
You know him well?

1075
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,510
Not really...

1076
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,140
He seems like a good person, so...

1077
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,850
- Shall I take you to the hospital?
- No.

1078
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,360
This is nothing!

1079
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,230
I'll be fine in a few days.

1080
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,570
- Take your shirt off.
- Huh?

1081
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,540
Come on!

1082
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,460
It looks terrible!

1083
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,840
Stay still, okay?

1084
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,430
Does it hurt?

1085
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,520
It feels good!

1086
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,650
Don't move.

1087
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,160
Press here a second.

1088
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:41,950
That's it.

1089
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,100
It's fine, I can do it myself.

1090
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,770
Stay put!

1091
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:06,190
You'll open the wound
if you move around. Right?

1092
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:09,480
Put your hands on your head.

1093
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,450
- Does it hurt?
- No.

1094
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:25,910
You smell good, Boss!

1095
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,210
I'm not wearing any perfume.

1096
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:32,800
Really? You kind of smell like my mom.

1097
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,590
Am I like your mom?

1098
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:43,100
No! She's a drunk and a whore.

1099
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,730
Sorry, I'm babbling.

1100
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,730
I can do the rest.

1101
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,690
Maybe I'll be like that when I grow up.

1102
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,450
You're kind, aren't you, Boss?

1103
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,350
You smell so nice.

1104
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,360
Like my mom.

1105
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,570
You smell like Mom.

1106
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:50,620
It's nice.

1107
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,860
I'm sorry! That was inexcusable, Boss!

1108
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,700
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1109
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,460
Who are you?

1110
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,510
Mei!

1111
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:48,350
Kindly come with us, would you?

1112
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,530
Why did you kill him?

1113
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:01,360
Why did you have to shoot him?

1114
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,000
Have a seat.

1115
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,220
What a beautiful young lady you are.

1116
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,760
I particularly like
that sparkle in your eyes.

1117
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,060
I had

1118
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:42,860
a daughter with beautiful eyes
just like yours.

1119
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:07,630
That was a long time ago, though.

1120
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,770
What did you do with the package?

1121
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,400
The heroin.

1122
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,320
I've never even seen it!

1123
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,910
You see, it was meant for me.

1124
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,670
But there was a little mishap

1125
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,880
and it ended up with you.

1126
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,180
I want you to give it back to me.

1127
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,970
I can't give back what I don't have!

1128
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,170
Listen to me.

1129
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,840
Only God has the right to decide
who lives and dies.

1130
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:35,220
But He's busy elsewhere right now.

1131
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,850
So, here in Japan,

1132
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,520
we're acting on His behalf.

1133
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,160
I'll tell you how I lost my legs.

1134
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:04,830
I tried to kill myself.

1135
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,340
I rigged a landmine up on the floor

1136
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,170
and slowly stepped on it.

1137
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:18,390
The thing is, just stepping on a landmine
won't detonate it.

1138
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,470
But if you were to shift your weight

1139
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,350
as you were standing on it
even just a little bit...

1140
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:31,020
Boom! It would be triggered instantly.

1141
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,650
So if you want to live,

1142
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,830
you can't move a muscle.

1143
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:49,420
I stood there for three days.

1144
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:56,760
First my feet went numb, and then
the numbness spread to my whole body.

1145
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:04,100
That feeling How can I explain it?

1146
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:09,940
Yes, the fear of death mingled
with the shuddering of my body...

1147
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,940
It was pleasure!

1148
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:17,190
I wonder if you can understand

1149
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:22,200
how pleasure can come
from being so close to death.

1150
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,040
I can't! And I don't want to!

1151
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,660
Let me help you.

1152
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,040
Where's the heroin?

1153
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:51,970
<i>These aren't tears.</i>

1154
01:32:53,190 --> 01:33:00,490
<i>ALL this is.</i>

1155
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:07,950
<i>Is where the fickle rain.</i>

1156
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:14,710
<i>Has wet my cheeks a little.</i>

1157
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:18,800
<i>This is Algeria</i>

1158
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,130
I need your help!

1159
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,300
Our chairman has been kidnapped
by Fatso.

1160
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:30,810
They'll only spare her life
if we come up with the heroin.

1161
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,440
But Fatso's got it wrong.

1162
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,310
We don't have any damn heroin.

1163
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,860
Right! You wouldn't touch that stuff.

1164
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:42,070
Please...

1165
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:46,280
Cut to the chase. You need me
because I'm Fatso's daughter, right?

1166
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,540
I'm begging you.

1167
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:55,250
Please tell me where your father is.

1168
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:57,920
What will you do if I tell you?

1169
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:00,420
I'll go see him.

1170
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,470
We'll talk it over.

1171
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,300
And what about when he
doesn't believe you?

1172
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:13,690
You should know that talking to Fatso
isn't going to solve anything.

1173
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,650
In that case...

1174
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:18,730
He'll kill you.

1175
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,580
Forget it.

1176
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,580
It's suicide.

1177
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,500
Don't move!

1178
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,420
It's too dangerous.

1179
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,970
You're in grave danger.

1180
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,640
That landmine is highly sensitive.

1181
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,350
If you move your body

1182
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:00,320
or your center of gravity
shifts even a little,

1183
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,110
you'll be blown to pieces in an instant.

1184
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,410
Mr. Fatso?

1185
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,790
I can't hear her. Turn up the volume.

1186
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,120
What was that?

1187
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,630
You need to see a psychiatrist.

1188
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:24,300
You demand heroin
that I don't even have.

1189
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,680
You enjoy watching people suffer.

1190
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,970
You're sick.

1191
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:33,520
Very well.

1192
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:39,400
I'll tell you why
I'm so interested in the heroin.

1193
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:42,820
You see,

1194
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:47,860
it's not just about the money.

1195
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:54,370
I want the number
of heroin addicts in Japan

1196
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,500
to grow by thousands, millions, even.

1197
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:01,710
Then, when they come off the heroin
and get withdrawal symptoms,

1198
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,670
I'll sit back and watch

1199
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:10,640
as they writhe about in agony.

1200
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,430
You're the Devil!

1201
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,350
Thank you.

1202
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:22,400
That's the greatest compliment
you could pay me.

1203
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,570
Mayumi!

1204
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,580
Stay back! It will explode!

1205
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:40,620
I can't take any more!

1206
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:45,800
Dad!

1207
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,380
Mayumi!

1208
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,680
Stay back!

1209
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,940
Dad! Turn it off!

1210
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,700
I'll tell you where the heroin is!

1211
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,570
Turn it off!

1212
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:25,920
I'm sorry. I tried to shut you out.

1213
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,090
Not because of you,

1214
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:32,220
more just what you represented,
I suppose.

1215
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:35,890
Well, it was only through
living with you, Izumi,

1216
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:39,020
that I came to start examining
my own shortcomings.

1217
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:41,810
Izumi.

1218
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,020
I don't like to be left out.

1219
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:48,780
Now, Mayumi.

1220
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,990
Isn't it about time you shared with me
where the heroin's stashed?

1221
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:55,740
If you don't, the girl
will be going back to...

1222
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,450
It's in her apartment.

1223
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,660
What? That makes no sense.

1224
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,160
I had that place searched exhaustively...

1225
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:06,210
You were searching for the wrong thing.
You were looking for powder, right?

1226
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,630
I dissolved it in water and put it
in bottles of lotion.

1227
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,890
That's my girl!

1228
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,640
- Hey, Kuroki!
- Yes, sir?

1229
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,020
Did you hear that just now?

1230
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:27,150
Mr. Kuroki?

1231
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:30,110
I didn't want to see you here like this.

1232
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:33,490
This cop sold his soul to the Devil.

1233
01:38:33,610 --> 01:38:35,700
He'll do anything for money.

1234
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,330
Absolutely. It was me who tortured
and killed that punk Hiko.

1235
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,540
Why?

1236
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,080
We couldn't find the heroin
in your apartment.

1237
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,960
So we worked on your men.

1238
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,710
You didn't have to kill him!

1239
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,050
He'd seen my face. I had no choice.

1240
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:53,220
Hey, Kuroki!

1241
01:38:54,300 --> 01:39:00,470
Sit down and tell the young lady
the whole story.

1242
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,520
Gladly.

1243
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:07,810
Security was unusually tight
at Narita Airport that day.

1244
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,360
That was how it began.

1245
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:16,280
I knew that the narcotics officers were
onto me after I picked up the heroin.

1246
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,950
I was questioned for 30 minutes
before being released.

1247
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,250
While I was being questioned,
Takashi Hoshi crashed into the truck.

1248
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,960
Takashi found a suspicious package
in his bag,

1249
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,590
so he gave it to me
when I came to see him at the airport.

1250
01:39:29,710 --> 01:39:31,880
It was a real shock
when I went to your apartment.

1251
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,090
Who should answer the door
but my boss' daughter?

1252
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:39,720
This moron said I was in the way,
and that I had to leave.

1253
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,220
He said he'd arrest me and hand me
over to Fatso if I disobeyed him.

1254
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,690
So that's why you vanished so suddenly?

1255
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,730
I never expected
things to turn out like this.

1256
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,820
Who would have thought
that a single package of heroin

1257
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:58,780
could lead to such a tragedy?

1258
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:05,290
You completely fooled me
with that lotion bottle trick, though.

1259
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:06,620
I better get going, then.

1260
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:10,040
I won't feel at ease
until I find the heroin.

1261
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:23,600
Let's enjoy our meal until Kuroki
returns with the heroin, shall we?

1262
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:28,600
This is the world's finest delicacy.

1263
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:30,730
It's not every day you get to eat it.

1264
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,500
What a sublime taste.

1265
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,470
<i>Délicieux!</i>

1266
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:08,140
What is it?

1267
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:09,850
Brains.

1268
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:11,480
Huh?

1269
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,810
Monkey brains.

1270
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:26,660
What's the matter?

1271
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:28,830
I need to use the bathroom...

1272
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:30,460
Hey! Show her the way.

1273
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:44,180
Hold it right there.

1274
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:46,390
Sakuma!

1275
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:48,850
Don't look behind you!

1276
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,600
Drop your gun!

1277
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,270
Oh, dear. I didn't want
to fight you, Brother.

1278
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,360
Then drop the gun.

1279
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:08,580
Please! Please don't kill me!

1280
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:11,410
Please...

1281
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:13,620
Don't kill me...

1282
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:56,040
Boss!

1283
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:01,710
Run!

1284
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:02,880
No!

1285
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:05,130
Run!

1286
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,720
Sakuma!

1287
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,850
This is bad, Boss.

1288
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,150
We fell into their trap.

1289
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:06,740
I don't mind. I'm glad!

1290
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:10,370
I thought I'd never see you again!

1291
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,330
Boss...

1292
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:15,000
You can't die.

1293
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:19,370
You have a bad habit of thinking
you'll sort everything out by dying.

1294
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,670
You need to get out of it.

1295
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,380
Sakuma!

1296
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,440
Boss!

1297
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,190
You've got guts...

1298
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:52,570
Lecturing me with our backs
against the wall like this.

1299
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:55,370
I'm falling for you.

1300
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,540
Give up this futile effort!

1301
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,150
It's time for some more vivisection.

1302
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,860
- Grab them!
- Wait!

1303
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,150
You promised to spare her.

1304
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:32,200
Mayumi!

1305
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:36,910
You really are naive, aren't you?

1306
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:39,540
Hey. Remove my legs.

1307
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,330
Now!

1308
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,970
Dad!

1309
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:55,680
Now why would I let go

1310
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:00,390
of such a great specimen?

1311
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,230
Strip her and fasten her
to the operating table.

1312
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:30,260
The Sandaiji Family is disbanded!

1313
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,420
Get out!

1314
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:37,260
Mayumi!

1315
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:49,360
It's strange.

1316
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:52,530
I feel like this is the first time

1317
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:55,570
I've ever seen you look so gentle, Dad.

1318
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,620
Hello?

1319
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:46,620
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

1320
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:48,960
<i>Mr. Kuroki?</i>

1321
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,300
I've been ambushed.

1322
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:58,340
The Hamaguchis took the heroin.

1323
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:59,510
<i>Hello?</i>

1324
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:01,510
<i>Mr. Kuroki?</i>

1325
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:02,720
<i>Hang in there!</i>

1326
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:06,430
Hagiwara double-crossed us.

1327
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,440
- The bastard.
<i>- Mr. Kuroki?</i>

1328
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,480
<i>You're hurt, aren't you?</i>

1329
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:14,190
<i>Stop talking now!</i>

1330
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,820
<i>Mr. Kuroki?</i>

1331
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:18,070
Izumi...

1332
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:22,910
You're a good girl.

1333
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:30,710
I liked you.

1334
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:40,180
Bye-bye.

1335
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,370
Why?

1336
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:06,410
Why did so many people have to die

1337
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:11,580
over a tiny bit of heroin?

1338
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,170
Because of money.

1339
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:18,300
It's worth hundreds of millions of yen.

1340
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:22,050
So everyone loses their minds chasing it.

1341
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:25,060
That damn Hamaguchi...

1342
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:30,350
He must have all those bottles lined up
in a row right now, laughing his ass off.

1343
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,110
- Sakuma.
- Yes?

1344
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,690
- Masa.
- Yes, Boss?

1345
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,990
Will you come with me?

1346
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:43,530
Where to?

1347
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:46,530
To Hamaguchi's offices.

1348
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:48,830
Hamaguchi's?

1349
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:52,000
We're going to storm the place.

1350
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,490
What?

1351
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:29,790
I need to take a leak.

1352
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:31,330
Idiot! Get off on the next floor.

1353
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:34,830
No! I'm going to die with you, Brother!

1354
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:39,750
Oh, I meant to ask you.

1355
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:43,130
Are you gay?

1356
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:49,760
I'm in love with him,
but he doesn't care about me!

1357
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,560
He killed someone
in the yakuza war in Osaka.

1358
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,230
I was inside at the time, too.

1359
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,570
We were in the same cell.

1360
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:03,150
Going to bed and waking up with him
every day, I guess I.

1361
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:06,240
I fell in love with him.

1362
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,370
You pervert!

1363
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:12,000
It's very painful, you know,

1364
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,830
unrequited love...

1365
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,760
- We're from the Medaka Family.
- Huh? Medaka?

1366
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:32,060
- Is the president in?
- Do you have an appointment?

1367
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,480
He won't see you
without an appointment.

1368
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,310
The chairman of the Medaka Family

1369
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:42,480
wants to see your boss!

1370
01:51:42,610 --> 01:51:43,990
Hurry up.

1371
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:45,150
- Go!
- Alright!

1372
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,820
I can't stand women.

1373
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:06,590
What?

1374
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,090
Graves.

1375
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:28,110
Ah, welcome! Come in, come in!

1376
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:31,240
Please, sit down! Take a seat!

1377
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,280
Hagiwara!

1378
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:38,750
First you turn your back on the Medakas
to work for Fatso,

1379
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,090
and now you bring heroin to suck up
to your new boss, Hamaguchi!

1380
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:46,880
You're what they call a snake!

1381
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,800
Sorry!

1382
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:52,390
I'm a very driven man.

1383
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:55,890
But thanks to you,
now I'm an executive here.

1384
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:57,810
Gentlemen, gentlemen...

1385
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,770
If you'd like,

1386
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:08,490
you're more than welcome to join
our management team, Izumi.

1387
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:16,830
After all, you handed me the two things
I wanted most on a silver platter.

1388
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:20,250
The heroin, and Fatso's head!

1389
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:31,050
Alright. Alright, alright.

1390
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:34,140
You'll like this, I promise.

1391
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:39,850
I'm handing over part of Fatso's territory
to the Medaka Family.

1392
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:43,690
Okay? Now you Medakas
can reestablish yourselves.

1393
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:46,190
Isn't that right, Izumi?

1394
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,280
I-zu-mi!

1395
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:53,780
What's that look for?

1396
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:57,540
You keep disrespecting me
by calling me by my first name.

1397
01:53:57,660 --> 01:53:59,450
Especially since you're just an old hick.

1398
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,000
"Hick"? "Old"?

1399
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,840
I'm not interested in
some shitty territory.

1400
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:08,050
What the hell did you say?

1401
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:12,010
What I want is the heroin.

1402
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:13,680
What?

1403
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,800
Hand over everything you have.

1404
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:18,060
Don't move!

1405
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,940
Hands on your head.

1406
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:26,900
Now! Do it!

1407
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,440
Do you realize what you're doing? Huh?

1408
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:33,860
You think you can sell all this?

1409
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,410
Not to mention the fact

1410
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:39,790
that we're not exactly going
to just let this slide.

1411
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,580
How pleasant!

1412
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,080
Stay right there!

1413
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,500
- Brother...
- Boss!

1414
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:10,920
Nobody moves!

1415
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:12,550
Brother!

1416
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:15,510
Hold me!

1417
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:16,760
Hold me tight!

1418
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:23,220
This is nice!

1419
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,600
- Masa!
- Masa!

1420
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:33,020
I'm so happy.

1421
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,570
I'm with my two favorite people,
and I'm in your arms.

1422
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,450
I can...

1423
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:44,620
Masa!

1424
01:56:46,330 --> 01:56:47,370
Masa!

1425
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:57,340
Go to hell!

1426
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:38,090
WELCOME!

1427
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:49,890
Boss.

1428
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:53,480
Everyone's waiting.

1429
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:48,990
So, it's all over!

1430
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:54,870
Hiko, Mei, and Masa are all dead.

1431
01:58:56,210 --> 01:58:57,880
This is the end of the Medaka Family.

1432
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:03,720
I'm sorry.

1433
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:08,930
I feel like none of this would have
happened if I hadn't become chairman.

1434
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:10,770
Don't be silly.

1435
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:14,440
Thanks to you,

1436
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:18,190
we got to go out in a blaze of glory.

1437
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:22,280
I have no doubt that these guys

1438
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:26,070
and the previous chairman
would have heaped praise on you.

1439
01:59:26,570 --> 01:59:27,950
I certainly will.

1440
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:30,280
Don't, we're not strangers!

1441
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,580
We are now.

1442
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,090
With the family gone,

1443
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:43,130
you're back to being
the girl in the sailor suit again.

1444
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,380
And I...

1445
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,140
What will you do, Sakuma?

1446
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:52,430
Leave Tokyo.

1447
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:55,230
Go out to the country somewhere

1448
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:57,190
and live a quiet life, I think.

1449
01:59:58,310 --> 02:00:00,860
And what about being a yakuza?

1450
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,650
I'm washing my hands
of the whole bloody business.

1451
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,530
Really?

1452
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:12,620
The yakuza are going backwards.

1453
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:17,000
They like to talk about
codes of honor and manhood.

1454
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,630
But deep down,

1455
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,090
they're afraid to move forward.

1456
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:25,630
So they don't dare to look to the future.

1457
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:28,840
The yakuza are a bunch
of cowards, really.

1458
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:33,510
You know who showed me that?

1459
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,060
You did, Boss.

1460
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:41,650
Don't call me that.

1461
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:43,730
The Medaka Family
doesn't exist anymore.

1462
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,900
In that case, Miss Hoshi...

1463
02:00:48,030 --> 02:00:49,070
Look after yourself.

1464
02:00:49,610 --> 02:00:50,660
You too, Sakuma.

1465
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:19,980
Promise me.

1466
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:22,310
Promise me you'll become a civilian.

1467
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:27,570
I'll become a civilian.

1468
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,820
Then I'll come visit you
at your apartment sometime.

1469
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,240
I promise you, Boss.

1470
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:38,120
You did it again!

1471
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:51,510
- Heave...
- Ho!

1472
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,350
Heave ho!

1473
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:09,610
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

1474
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:11,570
Oh, yeah.

1475
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:14,870
What happened to
that weird Mayumi person?

1476
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:16,780
She went to America.

1477
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:18,040
- America?
- Yeah.

1478
02:02:18,790 --> 02:02:19,910
Good for her.

1479
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,290
She's probably living by herself
in New York.

1480
02:02:22,410 --> 02:02:25,750
Actually, I bet she's got loads
of blond-haired lovers.

1481
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:28,000
You have it easy
in that department yourself.

1482
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:29,760
How do you mean?

1483
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:33,930
Well, you have your pick of at least
three boyfriends whenever you want.

1484
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:36,850
- Right!
- And would that mean you three?

1485
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:40,680
- Of course!
- Who else?

1486
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,940
She's laughing!

1487
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,810
Well, I'm glad you're so amused.

1488
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:50,110
Are we a joke to you?

1489
02:02:50,230 --> 02:02:51,570
No, it's not that!

1490
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:54,200
It's just been so long since I've heard
you goofing around,

1491
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,120
and I feel all giddy!

1492
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,330
I just can't stop laughing!

1493
02:02:59,370 --> 02:03:00,950
We weren't kidding!

1494
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:10,000
Excuse me!

1495
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:12,130
Are you Izumi Hoshi?

1496
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:16,010
Do you have a moment?

1497
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:17,220
Yes?

1498
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,390
Not you.

1499
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:23,180
I'm a police officer.

1500
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:27,610
Izumi? Are you back to your old tricks?

1501
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:51,460
There was a fight between
two yakuza late last night.

1502
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:58,720
- Yakuza?
- Yes.

1503
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:01,810
He stepped in to break it up, apparently.

1504
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:05,060
Then one of the gangsters pulled a knife

1505
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,520
and stabbed him in the chest.

1506
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,730
Death would have been almost instant.

1507
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:16,860
Is he a yakuza, too?

1508
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,490
No, no.

1509
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:21,200
He's here on business from Hokkaido.

1510
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:24,580
- Hokkaido?
- Yes.

1511
02:04:25,450 --> 02:04:26,750
One second.

1512
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:39,430
Please take a look at this.

1513
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:46,230
I think he was just going to leave his
card in your mailbox or something,

1514
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:48,270
but he must have changed his mind.

1515
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:51,650
He decided to come back
to visit you later,

1516
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:54,190
so he went to kill some time.

1517
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,650
But then he saw the yakuza brawl...

1518
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:58,070
- Please, stop.
- Huh?

1519
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:06,750
When he saw them fighting, he couldn't
just stand back and do nothing.

1520
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:12,000
Because if he did,

1521
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:16,340
one of them would be hurt over nothing.

1522
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:22,640
Knowing that,

1523
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,350
he couldn't turn a blind eye.

1524
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:29,180
If you don't mind my asking,

1525
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:31,020
what's your relationship
to the deceased?

<i>Is to keep holding you forever.</i>

1535
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:31,530
<i>I just want to stay like this.</i>

1536
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:39,080

02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:12,410
