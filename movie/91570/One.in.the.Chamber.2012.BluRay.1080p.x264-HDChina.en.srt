1
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,279
When Communism fell
in Eastern Europe,

2
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,197
law and order broke down.

3
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,700
Organized crime rose in its place--

4
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,369
not that it wasn't there before.

5
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,955
But after that,
it became open season,

6
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,459
everyone looking for a fistful of Euros,
myself included.

7
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,881
When one mob family has a problem
with another, they call me.

8
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,050
For the right price, I solve it.

9
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,261
I'm a fixer.
That's what I do.

10
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,513
But that's not the only reason
I'm here.

11
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,672
Hey, man.
It's been a while, Demyan.

12
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,340
What's up, brother?

13
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,719
- Liev, good to see you. I'm fine.
- Vlad is waiting for you upstairs.

14
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,817
- Hello?
- Yes, Nicholi. Yes.

15
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,694
We're ready on our end.

16
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,071
Everything is in place
and ready for the shipment.

17
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,701
Perfect. We'll be ready to deliver it
within the next 48 hours.

18
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,167
What can I say, Vlad?
It's been a pleasure.

19
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,089
I'll call you after it's arrived.

20
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,724
Welcome back, my friend.

21
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,228
It's good to be back, Vlad.

22
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,023
You were away too goddamn long,
you know that?

23
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,858
I had to drink alone.

24
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,319
I am sure
this was no problem for you.

25
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,487
Eh?

26
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,864
- Let's drink together.
- Come on.

27
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,541
Thank you, Nadia.

28
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,212
So, tell me about Grozny.

29
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,008
This deal, it went well. Because
they're looking after our interest.

30
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,428
I figured as much,
but I meant tell me about the city.

31
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,141
I have heard they almost rebuilt it now
brick for brick.

32
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,601
It's still Grozny.

33
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,353
Remember Sergei?

34
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:04,316
He shot that bitch
just for scuffing his boot.

35
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,527
He was a crazy bastard.

36
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,699
So many of our brothers
died in Chechnya.

37
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,249
To Sergei.

38
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,544
To Sergei.

39
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,217
You know, someone
should go back there

40
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,012
and knock it down again
for old times' sake.

41
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,306
Vlad,

42
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,725
the war is long over, hmm?

43
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:41,854
Not in here it isn't.
Not for me.

44
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,981
- Vlad?
- I'm busy.

45
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,150
It's Mikhail Suverov.

46
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,866
Mikhail, good to hear from you.

47
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,369
We drew lines in the sand,
you and I.

48
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,163
You've wiped them clean.

49
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,503
What are you talking about?

50
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:11,425
You're doing business with
Nicholi Dvorak without my green light.

51
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,219
Bullshit.

52
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,387
Who the hell told you this?

53
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,265
Someone who knew.

54
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,852
Look, I don't know
who this man is,

55
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,063
but whoever it is,
he's lying to you.

56
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,148
He's trying to turn us
against each other.

57
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,275
The problem I have with that

58
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,029
is that his is not the only mouth
I've heard this from.

59
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,115
You know how it goes--
you hear things so many times,

60
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,785
there's maybe probably
some truth to it.

61
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,123
It's not what you think.
Nicholi, he came to us.

62
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,253
Of course he did, my friend.

63
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,674
You're trying to take my business
from beneath me.

64
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,969
You're undercutting me
by five points.

65
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,139
You killed three years
of peace between us

66
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,225
for a handful of silver, Vlad.

67
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:06,063
And I have just killed you.

68
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,148
No, wait--

69
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,469
Vlad? Demyan?
Talk to me.

70
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,888
We are pinned down.
He's got a gunman with .50 cal

71
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,058
across the street,
shooting through a window.

72
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,852
When you find him,
you murder the son of a bitch.

73
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,398
Across the street.
Go, go.

74
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,661
Ah!

75
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,927
- Come on!
- Ah!

76
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,137
- Come on!
- No, no!

77
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,272
Shit.

78
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,118
Is he done?

79
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,420
Get rid of that.

80
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,591
What are you waiting for?
Get rid of it.

81
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,178
And make sure he disappears.
We don't want any combat.

82
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,862
Hey, you, stop!

83
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,532
I said stop!

84
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,455
Turn the fuck around.

85
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,043
I said turn around!

86
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,536
There are those who say
it's a blessing to know who you are,

87
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,998
what you've been destined
to do in life.

88
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,709
But to me
it's more like a curse.

89
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,507
How did I end up here?

90
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,052
A series of random events, fate.

91
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,430
It's hard to tell anymore.

92
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,183
But here I am.

93
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,394
The money's good,

94
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,562
but you still pay a price.

95
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,922
Isaiah 43:18--

96
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,092
"Forget the former things;
do not dwell in the past."

97
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,346
If there's one thing in life
I know that's true,

98
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,348
it's that the past is the devil.

99
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,893
You can't run from it.
It's always behind you.

100
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,341
- Hey.
- Ciao.

101
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,127
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Janice.

102
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,944
Yes, it arrives tomorrow.

103
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,529
Me as well, my friend.

104
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,658
I'll call you with an update
as soon as I know more.

105
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,535
Speak then.

106
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,167
Bobby.

107
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,879
- How'd it go?
- Good.

108
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,756
He's chomping at the bit
to get the cargo.

109
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,051
- Hmm. Has it left Damascus yet?
- No.

110
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,512
it only left Astrakhan
an hour ago.

111
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,390
it should be there
about three and a half hours.

112
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,808
And the turnaround?

113
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,018
it should hit Colombia
by late tomorrow evening.

114
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,021
Say two hours
for offload, reload, refuel,

115
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,774
and then another 23 hours
back again.

116
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,944
We should be good to go
by the end of the week.

117
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,654
Is good.

118
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,198
Go and get the car.

119
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,453
Da?

120
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,956
I am calling
to negotiate terms.

121
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,792
Who the fuck is this?

122
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,044
Mikhail, my father always told me,

123
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,213
never ask a question
you already know the answer.

124
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,715
You waste my fucking time.

125
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,092
You thought I was dead,
didn't you?

126
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,928
Demyan.

127
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,433
Look, Mikhail,
I hold the reins now.

128
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,853
And fortunately for both you and I,
we are at the reset point.

129
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,564
So I figure it's best
we negotiate terms swiftly

130
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,482
while there's still blood
in the water.

131
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,068
Da. I'm listening.

132
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,781
You crawl into Vlad's grave
and bury yourself alive,

133
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,535
or I will find you
and I'll kill you

134
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,246
and I'll bury you myself.

135
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,875
Those are my terms.

136
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,922
What now?

137
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,091
We hit them harder
than they hit us.

138
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,052
I am going to unleash hell.

139
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,888
Go.

140
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,225
We need to think this through.
We need to be smart.

141
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,602
I'm going to destroy him.

142
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,730
Yeah, but we go to war with Demyan
and we can't go through Leo.

143
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:05,193
His cleaner screwing up and
not eliminating Demyan as well as Vlad

144
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,612
is the reason we have the problem
in the first place.

145
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,824
But he's the only independent
in town.

146
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,409
So what do you suggest?

147
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,496
Did you ever hear of the Wolf?

148
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,875
He's a fairy tale.

149
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:25,338
Tsk-tsk-tsk. The stories I hear,
they're no fairy tale.

150
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,843
Ari Perovsky has his number.

151
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,903
Shut it.

152
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,740
- What?
- Is this the man they call the Wolf?

153
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,201
I prefer Aleksey,
but yes, they're one and the same.

154
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,829
Can you be in Prague
by tomorrow?

155
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,914
That's a bit
short notice there, mate.

156
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,125
We'll double your rate.

157
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,713
Okay, text me an address.
And until then, fuck off.

158
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,926
Sorry about that.

159
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,387
Now about that money
you be owin' Slim Jimmy...

160
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:18,766
So, they sent a dog
to collect their scraps.

161
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,271
Actually they sent a wolf.

162
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,254
Go!

163
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,076
Can you pay?

164
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,870
Ahhh!

165
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,497
- Will you pay?
- Yes!

166
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,374
Ahh!

167
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,669
- When?
- Ah! Stop, God damn it!

168
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,171
It's in the other room.

169
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,216
Ah! Okay, okay!

170
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,344
It's in the vault behind the bar!

171
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,936
Ah-hh!

172
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,216
One for the client...

173
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,805
and the rest for me.

174
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,695
Good dog.

175
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,931
I've been watching her
for a long time now.

176
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:49,143
We're like two trains on the same track
headed for a collision course.

177
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,896
I've been reluctant
to deal with it.

178
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,023
But sooner or later,
if I don't,

179
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,776
it will deal with me.

180
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,238
The time is near.

181
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,742
Is that you, Leo?

182
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,162
Usual place, tomorrow,
half past 8:00.

183
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,831
Hey, listen, it's my--

184
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,151
Excuse me.

185
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,793
Well, hello, Ray.

186
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,421
One unaccounted for.

187
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,256
Yeah, so I was told.

188
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,843
Hey, man, Mikhail is the one
who asked to make a show of it.

189
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,180
If you didn't agree to the terms, you
shouldn't have accepted the job, Ray.

190
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,806
Fair enough.

191
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,558
He shouldn't have
pulled a woman in front of him.

192
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,393
She was a whore.

193
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,024
We work on results, Ray,
not excuses. You know that.

194
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,943
I will finish with Demyan.
I can promise you that.

195
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,362
You're a day late and a dollar short
for that, my friend.

196
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,158
They've already hired in
another shooter for the job.

197
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,368
So where does that leave me?

198
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,830
I strongly doubt
that Mr. Mikhail Suverov

199
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,168
will be requiring my services
anytime soon due to this little fiasco.

200
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,880
They're angry, Ray.
And who can blame them?

201
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,675
There's a million like Suverov,
just like him.

202
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,345
Why do you think I rang?

203
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,565
Another gig in my own back yard
doesn't exactly sit well with me, Leo.

204
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,568
Besides, this looKs like
we're biting the hand that feeds us.

205
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,363
Not if the hand isn't
feeding you anymore, it isn't.

206
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,448
Demyan wants to retaliate.

207
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,076
And he's willing to pay
a lot more than the Suverovs.

208
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:13,037
And hitting both brothers, well...

209
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,790
he'll pay extra for that.

210
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:19,085
Hey, Ray?
We started a war here.

211
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,504
Wars are good for business.

212
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:25,216
So you can cash in
or you can cash out.

213
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,843
The choice is yours.

214

What do you want?

221
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,691
I'm looking for Bobby Suverov.

222
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,526
And who the hell are you?

223
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,737
Aleksey Andreev.

224
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,280
Who?

225
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,285
Fuck you, that's who.

226
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,913

And you are?

234
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,616
Hungry, tired, thirsty.

235
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,534
Aleksey.

236
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,372
Come. Come!

237
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,709
What do you want?

238
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,796
Ahem.
Well, I don't know.

239
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,547
What would you recommend
to be sipping on

240
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,800
in a wet fucking heat
like the here and now?

241
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,845
A tall glass of ice water
coupled with shots, sir.

242
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,263
Are you all right with shots?

243
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,641
I prefer it, in fact.

244
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,561
Appleton Estate, 30-year-old rum
from Jamaica, sir.

245
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,481
I think it would be
perfect in here, sir.

246
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,406
I'm digging
the sales pitch there, boyo.

247
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,741
I'll give it a go.

248
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,621
So, my friend,
how do we begin?

249
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,957
Introductions would be nice.

250
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,209
Mikhail Suverov.

251
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,628
Bobby Suverov.

252
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,090
Aleksey.

253
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,885
As for my unfortunate moniker,
I'd rather you not use it.

254
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,804
It's so goddamn cliché.

255
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,182
Yeah, whatever.
Aleksey, tell me,

256
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,727
what do you know
about the current state of play

257
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,603
here in the Golden City?

258
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,939
Same old, same old,
I'd assume.

259
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,942
Two parties of different opinions

260
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,903
gnawing at each other's throats
over trivialities.

261
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,199
- I like the way you think.
- I don't...

262
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:41,203
think, that is.
I simply do.

263
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,290
What exactly is it
that you do?

264
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,127
I play chess with the old Boromets
in the park

265
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,504
every Tuesday,
Thursday afternoon.

266
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:54,383
I restore cars from the '70s,
pinball machines from the '90s,

267
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,719
and if you pay me enough,

268
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,847
I'll probably kill
anything that breathes.

269
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,432
Probably?

270
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,729
As in no innocent party, mate.

271
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:10,232
Kids are off the table regardless,
but I have no problem with women.

272
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,942
Although I only shoot them.

273
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,028
Using your hands
or a blade on a lady

274
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:18,407
just comes across as rather weak
and rather tacky, you know?

275
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,159
That's fair enough.

276
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,166
So what is it
that you want me to do?

277
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,296
Wreak havoc.

278
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,507
This is Demyan Ivanov,

279
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,177
his underboss Grigori Rikoniev,
and his number two.

280
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,305
And Nicholi Dvorak,
local Czech scum.

281
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:47,311
Nicholi is the one that started this,
so he's up first.

282
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,232
Hello, Nicholi.

283
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,609
Who are you?

284
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,571
A trained monkey.

285
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,828
But well enough paid

286
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,372
to do the little touch.

287
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,816
What are you doing, Ray?

288
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,618
Seriously, it's time to go.

289
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,411
I haven't finished my drink.

290
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,289
Just finish the one you've got
and pay.

291
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,168
Ha.

292
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,129
Bring me another drink now.

293
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,548
Sorry, we're closed.
You've had enough. Go.

294
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,760
Oh, yeah, bitch?
Then I'm taking this with me.

295
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,970
- You're not taking anything--
- Get your fucking--

296
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,807
- Ah!
- Let go of him.

297
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,601
Okay, okay, I'll go.

298
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,104
It's okay. Let go, please.
It's okay. Um...

299
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:59,068
- Everything okay, Janice?
- Yeah, it's fine. It's okay.

300
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,363
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, no, no, no.

301
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,574
No use crying over spilt milk.

302
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,369
Huh. You're American.

303
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,120
Yeah.

304
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,539
- Give me a sec, okay?
- No, that's okay.

305
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,084
No, I'll take care of this.
It'll just be a second.

306
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,544
Club soda and salt,
works every time.

307
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,174
First they killed Vlad,
and then Demyan becomes boss.

308
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,177
But is he happy
about his accidental promotion?

309
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,847
No.
The bastard appreciates nothing.

310
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,765
Hey, they served together
in Chechnya.

311
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,892
Vlad took a bullet for Demyan.

312
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,061
- They were brothers in blood.
- So what?

313
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,730
Does that make me
less of a man

314
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,065
because I didn't kill bitches
with them in Grozny?

315
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,985
I mean, what about me?
First I'm the underboss's underboss,

316
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,320
and then the boss dies
and what does that make me?

317
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,865
I'm still a fucking underboss.

318
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,785
Life is shit.

319
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,663
You always see the glass half empty
when you drink, Grigori.

320
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:40,085
Oh, by the way,
my glass is empty, Liev.

321
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,672
Tell me, if I always
get to refill your fucking drinks,

322
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,924
then what does that make me?

323
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,094
An underboss.

324
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,601
Two at table two,

325
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,478
one at table three,

326
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,189
four at table six,

327
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,066
three at table eight.

328
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,819
Two clips, 17 rounds apiece,
makes 34.

329
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,615
10 men, three rounds apiece,
four slated to miss.

330
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,753
Oi!

331
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,631
Which one of you poor fools
is Grigori?

332
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,847
Who the fuck are you?

333
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:02,709
So the left's
only three in the clip,

334
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,629
and the right...

335
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,640
one in the chamber.

336
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,896
It was a thing of beauty, no?

337
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,371
You know that shit
that killed Elvis, right?

338
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,498
This shit here
definitely would.

339
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,796
Well, if it killed Elvis, it could kill
me and maybe I don't want to do it.

340
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,300
Baby, relax.
It's just an expression. Come on.

341
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:37,179
Well, it doesn't sound good. You should
think of a different expression.

342
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,264
Just fucking do it.
Shut up.

343
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,318
I told you, right?

344
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,621
Baby?

345
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,539
What really did kill Elvis?

346
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:08,377
That? Pills, something.
I don't know. Fuck.

347
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,971
- You.
- Out.

348
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,435
You-- you worked for us.

349
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,980
Not anymore.

350
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:31,650
Look, whatever it is
they're paying you,

351
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,278
Mikhail will double it.

352
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,656
Okay?
He'll triple it.

353
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,874
No, wait. I mean...

354
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,585
I'm his only brother.

355
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,255
He should have had another.

356
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:02,639
It's Bobby! It's Bobby!

357
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,349
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- There's someone out there!

358
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,351
He's got a gun!

359
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,378
No!

360
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,878
Yeah?

361
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,838
What the fuck is going on,
Andrei?

362
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,007
What's happened
to my goddamn update?

363
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,718
Yeah, Leo--

364
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,471
Leo's man took care
of Bobby last night.

365
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,515
And Mikhail?

366
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,644
From what I understand, he walked in
only seconds after the job was done.

367
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,730
Hmm.
This is fucking beautiful.

368
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:37,317
Yeah, I hear it's really
fucked Mikhail up.

369
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,529
Of course it did.
This was his brother.

370
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,572
He's been looking out for this kid
his whole life.

371
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,451
Maybe this time he should try
looking out a little harder.

372
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,287
I, uh...

373
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,957
I got bits of bad news.

374
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,960
What exactly is bad news, Andrei?

375
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,964
They hit Nicholi Dvorak.

376
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,507
What?

377
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,970
The police found him
floating in the pool, 9mm to the head.

378
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,638
It's not the end of the world.

379
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,890
We'll find somebody else
to do the business with.

380
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:14,771
Andrei, is this it?
This is the bad news?

381
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,650
Nicholi isn't the only one
who got hit.

382
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,653
What are you talking about?
Who else?

383
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,490
Somebody hit
the booking house.

384
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,702
Killed everybody--

385
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,787
killed all the boys.

386
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,623
Grigori?

387
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,795
Grigori, Liev--
everybody there dead.

388
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,097
What about my money?

389
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,850
I'm not sure.

390
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,477
What the fuck do you mean
you're not sure?!

391
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,479
I-- I just got bits and pieces.

392
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,355
The cops were crawling
out of the place.

393
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,150
- I couldn't stay for long, but--
- But nothing!

394
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,987
- Find my goddamn money, Andrei!
- Yes, boss. I understand, yes.

395
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,239
Just give me some time
to make some calls.

396
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,742
Give me 20 minutes
and I'll call you right back.

397
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,828
You've only got 10.

398
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,013
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,848
There you are.

400
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,560
You left yourjacket.

401
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,896
Oh, right.
How'd you find me?

402
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:23,483
Oh.
I found this in your pocket.

403
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,197
Address. Nice.

404
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,949
It's clean, by the way.

405
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,576
Oh. How much do I owe you?

406
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,245
No, no, no. I did it myself.
It's good.

407
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,497
Lucky for me, the right address
was in the envelope,

408
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,416
because it didn't have your name.

409
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,751
- I'm Ray.
- Oh.

410
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,421
- Just Ray?
- Ray Carver.

411
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:48,174
I'm Janice.
Look, I'm sorry forjust stopping by.

412
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,303
I just wanted to say thank you.
You know, you took off so fast, I--

413
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,972
No, I'm glad you did. I--

414
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,557
I guess I owe you one.

415
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:57,642
Oh, yeah?

416
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,686
Okay.

417
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,439
Well, in that case, um...

418
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,691
Mmm.

419
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,488
Fair enough.

420
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,741
Well, hopefully I'll--
I'll talk to you soon.

421
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,451
Hopefully.

422
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,787
Bye.

423
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,629
Shit.

424
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,756
Did you lock yourself out?

425
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,383
Nope, I'm good.
See ya.

426
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,719
Okay.

427
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,624
So...

428
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,501
am I still on the payroll?

429
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,086
Hmm.

430
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,254
What would you have me do?

431
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,925
If it were my way,

432
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,803
I would have you raze this city
to the ground

433
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,181
and salt every inch of it.

434
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,810
But I made a promise
to my brother

435
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:26,272
to be smart,
to think things through.

436
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,026
Come with me.

437
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,003
Mikhail.

438
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,131
Leo.

439
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,303
Hey, Aleksey.

440
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,306
I heard you were in town.

441
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,936
He's very expensive,
but he's worth it.

442
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,521
You two have met?

443
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:12,360
Let's just say that we both run
in similar circles.

444
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,655
Why am I here, Mikhail?

445
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,117
Your boy, whoever he is,

446
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,036
he didn't finish the job
with Demyan,

447
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,914
but he sure hit a home run

448
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,375
when he killed my brother.

449
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:32,088
Now exactly which boy
are we talking about?

450
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,967
Bobby's girl
saw the black bastard.

451
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,844
Come on, Leo, be honest.

452
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,723
How many monkeys
are there in this city?

453
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:48,271
Playing both sides
is a very dangerous game, my friend.

454
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,524
I want to know his name

455
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,360
and I want to know
where he sleeps.

456
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,572
Come on, Mikhail,
you're taking a piss.

457
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,616
What sort of handler
would I be

458
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:02,911
if I kept tossing out the names
of my assets, eh?

459
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,913
You disrespect me.

460
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,249
You are Iucky to be alive!

461
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,127
You accepted the contract
for my brother.

462
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,297
That makes you
directly involved in his death.

463
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:18,885
You should be counting your
fucking blessings that I am asking you.

464
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,889
My black bastard
isn't mine anymore.

465
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,854
Not since he cost me
my livelihood with you.

466
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:33,566
Come on, Mikhail!
You're my best client.

467
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,777
Do I look that stupid?

468
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,697
If you're lying to me,
I'll cut your fucking head off.

469
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,617
I don't doubt you, Mikhail.

470
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,703
I've known you for a long time.

471
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,458
You tell me everything you know
about this boy.

472
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,798
I will tell you one thing--

473
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,426
if you go looking for him,

474
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,763
he'll find you first.
I promise you.

475
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,792
That's not him.

476
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,067
This is longer than 10 minutes.

477
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,696
I'm sorry. I had to reach out
to a friend of mine at the department.

478
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,989
It wasn't easy.

479
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,286
And?

480
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,622
The cops took the money.

481
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,749
They have it in evidence
downtown.

482
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,379
I did find out, though,

483
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,423
that there was a survivor
at the betting room,

484
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,967
one of the bookies.
He saw the whole thing.

485
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,761
According to him,
this huge guy

486
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,596
came right to the front door,

487
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,183
called out Grigori,
whipped out two 9mms

488
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,144
and started blazing.

489
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,855
One guy?
This is bullshit, Andrei.

490
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,233
What the bookie said he looked like
is even crazier.

491
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,651
What do you mean?

492
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,237
Seven-foot tall,
wearing a tacky Hawaiian shirt

493
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,697
with a white fedora.

494
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:13,119
He said he looked like
a Frank Sinatra on steroids.

495
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,663
The Wolf.

496
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,124
What?

497
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,043
Mikhail--

498
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,587
he hired an out-of-towner.
He hired the Wolf.

499
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:26,007
But the Wolf is just
a bullshit ghost story.

500
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:29,052
No.
No, he's as real as it gets.

501
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,221
He must have been the same one
who took out Vlad as well.

502
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,600
What are we going to do?

503
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,143
What the fuck
do you think we're going to do?

504
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,853
We're going to go Wolf hunting.

505
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,858
Everyone bleeds, Andrei.

506
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:47,945
Put the word out-- I will pay top dollar
to find this guy, okay?

507
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,491
- Okay, I understand.
- Good.

508
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,701
Meet me tomorrow
at the betting room at 5:00.

509
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,037
Don't be late,
and fuckin' bring me something.

510
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:59,082
- Something good.
- Okay.

511
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,300
Leo, this is my third message.

512
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,927
What the hell is going on?

513
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,929
How'd they know
I was going to be there?

514
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,680
Call me back!

515
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,254
Wow.

516
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,047
Not bad.

517
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,680
Can I get you a drink?

518
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,557
No, I'm good. Thanks.

519
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:04,814
Look, it's just your accent,
you being from the States and all...

520
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,899
Mmm.

521
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,318
I guess you remind me
of home.

522
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,155
Mmm, ah.
You miss it?

523
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,616
Yeah.
But I had to leave.

524
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,451
Why?

525
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,038
Too many bad memories.

526
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:25,793
And now sometimes I think
I'm just in this city to hide, you know?

527
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,545
Too scared to go back.

528
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,714
Right. Scared of what?

529
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,057
My dad was murdered.

530
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,481
The guy that did it--
they never found him.

531
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,444
He had this mask on.

532
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:54,113
I saw him, though.
I saw the whole thing.

533
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:59,076
I was just a little girl,

534
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,121
but, hmm,
I'll never forget.

535
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,959
I'm sorry.

536
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,673
I mean, that's tough.

537
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,970
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

538
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,487
I'm sorry.
I have to get this.

539
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,074
Leo?

540
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,910
I'm sorry, mate,
but I did you wrong.

541
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,162
What's up?

542
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,831
Things are going to get
pretty tough for us, Ray.

543
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,333
What are you telling me, Leo?

544
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,627
I'm gonna get out of Dodge.

545
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,129
You gotta get out too.
Get outta Prague.

546
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,091
Mikhail clamped the vise.

547
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,550
And I gave you up--

548
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,428
your name,
where you're gonna be,

549
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,889
where you live.
All of it. I'm sorry, mate.

550
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,351
If I didn't, I was history.

551
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,648
Sorry.

552
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,203
Hey.

553
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,372
This belonged to my dad.

554
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,915
He took it everywhere.

555
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,501
Why is it here?

556
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,879
Tell me!

557
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,216
There's pictures of me in here.
This is my life.

558
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:38,718
What-- why?

559
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,054
Did you have something to do
with his death?

560
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,726
Huh?
Tell me.

561
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,646
Tell me. Tell me!

562
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,231
Yes.

563
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,073
Why?

564
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:05,619
Because it was
what I was hired to do.

565
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,749
And now you're here
to kill me?

566
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,919
No.
I'm trying to protect you.

567
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,257
Am I supposed to
believe that, really?

568
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,160
Catch you at a bad time?

569
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,456
I threw you out the window.

570
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,626
I bounce real good.

571
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,802
And the grenades?

572
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,555
I thought it was a nice touch.

573
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,108
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

574
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,984
The bad guy.

575
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,823
That's funny.

576
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,992
I thought I was.

577
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:17,144
We just got back
from the black guy's place.

578
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,147
Is it over?
Is he dead?

579
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,149
No, I don't think so.

580
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,109
What happened?

581
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,364
The place was a mess.
But no bodies.

582
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,616
We thought this might be
interesting to you.

583
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,952
The same girl--
she's in every picture.

584
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,719
And Aleksey?

585
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,264
I called him.

586
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,642
He told me to tell you
goodbye.

587
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:12,032
Shit.

588
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,003
Guess what?

589
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,091
Thrill me.

590
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,803
We got an anonymous tip

591
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,347
about Mikhail's new man.

592
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:39,685
You're right--
it is the Wolf.

593
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,527
He's staying at some
high-end hotel downtown.

594
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,201
We end this.

595
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,541
We end this now.

596
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,049
Hi, this is Janice.
Please leave a message

597
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,677
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. ThanKs.

598
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:42,141
Hey, Janice, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?

599
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,144
It's just I, uh...

600
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,146
Just call me back.

601
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,105
- You ready?
- Shit.

602
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,524
I mean yeah.

603
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,071
Shh.

604
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,699

You know,

some call it a sixth sense,

01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,451
others intuition

Ray, how the hell are you, mate?

627
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,930
Leo?

628
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's me.

629
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,977
Why are you calling me
from Janice's phone, Leo?

630
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,729
I got down here as soon as I could
just like you asked.

631
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,068
How many waiting for me?

632
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,736
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,447
She's here right now.
Lovely girl, Ray.

634
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:10,492
Hey, you should have told me
about her before.

635
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,371
We are actually
getting rat-assed together.

636
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:16,707
Can you get out?

637
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,959
No, no, no, no can do.

638
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,420
She's a bit tied up at the moment,
taking someone's order.

639
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,964
The place
is absolutely jumping, Ray.

640
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:25,882
I'm on my way.

641
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:31,096
Hey, we'll tie one off before we get
out of this dump for good, shall we?

642
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,431
Right.

643
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,476
Did I overdo it?

644
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,438
Depends on whether or not
he shows.

645
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:44,359
He'll show, trust me.
You won't be disappointed.

646
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,933
You've never looked better, Leo.

647
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,937
It's the one-armed push-ups, Ray.

648
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,647
Where is she?

649
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,942
She's with Mikhail.
Said he was going back to the club.

650
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,708
Sorry, Ray.

651
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,169
Looks like I four-letter-worded you
again, mate.

652
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:49,174
They say after the second time,
you should give flowers

653
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,676
or a box of candy.

654
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,845
Let's go.

655
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:01,520
I wish I had something
to give you.

656
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,027
Maybe you still can.

657
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,367
Thank you, Ray.

658
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,803
Jeremiah 8:20--

659
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:20,432
"The summer has passed,
the harvest has ended,

660
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,475
and we are not saved."

661
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,271
We all have to pay
for our sins eventually.

662
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:27,939
That I know.

663
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,609
We all have it coming.

Stay quiet!

683
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,572
Who's fucking next?!

684
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:49,033
Enough!

685
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,206
Back off!

686
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:00,211
Back off!

687
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:06,426
Drop it or she's dead.
Put it down.

688
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,059
You're gonna die tonight.

689
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:19,314
The question is--
does she die with you?

690
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,006
Catch you fellas at a bad time?

691
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,849
Ray?

692
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,310
Go. Go.

693
01:21:58,205 --> 01:21:59,914
You gotta go.

694
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,584
You gotta get out of Prague.

695
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,461
I'm sorry.

696
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,009
I'm sorry for everything.

697
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,352
You gotta go.

698
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:49,691
I spent a lot of time
and came a long way

699
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,819
to ask you
one extremely short question.

700
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,029
Why didn't I kill you?

701
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,326
Nobody paid me to kill you.

702
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,581
But the next logical question is...

703
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:08,543
what the fuck
are you doing in my house?

704
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:14,048
I never really enjoyed being manipulated
by those underworld assholes,

705
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:16,134
so then I thought to myself--

706
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,512
"Aleksey, there are a lot of assholes
out there with lots of money.

707
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,807
Instead of earning it from them...

708
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,186
why don't we
just take it from them?"

709
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,611
Why not?

710
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,989
Maybe I'll give you
a call sometime.

711
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,492
That, my friend, you may.

712
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:56,507
Lamentations 3:26--

713
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,801
"It is good that a man
should both hope and quietly wait

714
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,512
for the salvation of the Lord."

715
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,640
No matter where you run,

716
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,852
you always end up
right back where it all started,

717
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,188
back with yourself.

718
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:15,359
Maybe I'll never know
how I ended up where I have.

719
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:18,196
I do know that the price
I have to pay

720
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,115
is that I'll never be saved,

721
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,909
but at least she can be.
