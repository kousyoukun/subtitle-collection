你什麽意思？

59
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:11,427
尼克莱.德沃克 在未经我的许可下交易
You're doing business with Nicholi Dvorak without my green light.

60
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,221
胡扯
Bullshit.

61

他妈的 谁告诉你的？
Who the hell told you this?

62

了解内情的人
Someone who knew.

63

我不知道这人是谁
Look, I don't know who this man is,

64
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,065
但不管他是谁 是在胡扯
but whoever it is, he's lying to you.

65
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,150
他试图挑起我们的对抗
He's trying to turn us against each other.

66
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,277
这就是问题的所在
The problem I have with that

67
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:32,031
是 并不是只有他告诉我
is that his is not the only mouth I've heard this from.

68
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,117
知道会怎麽样吗 无风不起浪
You know how it goes-- you hear things so many times,

69
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,787
还有一些可能是真的
there's maybe probably some truth to it.

70
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:43,125
这不是你想的 尼克莱已投靠我们了
It's not what you think. Nicholi, he came to us.

71
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,255
当然 他做到了 我的朋友

72
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,676
你想抢我的生意
You're trying to take my business from beneath me.

73

你削我5个百分点

你毁了我们三年内的和平共存

75
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,227
铢铢必较 弗拉德
for a handful of silver, Vlad.

76

我不得不杀了你
And I have just killed you

77

你还等什麽？ 搞定他

嘿 你 别动！
Hey, you, stop!

100

Fixer's voice: There are those who say it's a blessing to know who you are,

107
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,000
这好像天生注定的
what you've been destined to do in life.

108
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,711
对於我来说 这是一个诅咒

我会在这里结束吗？
How did I end up here?

110
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:52,054
一经过命运多变的曲折
A series of random events, fate.

111
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,432
你无法体会
It's hard to tell any more.

112

但我仍完好
But here I am.

113

钱固然是好
The money's good,

114
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,564

"Forget the former things; do not dwell in the past."

122

If there's one thing in life I know that's true,

123
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,350
那过去的岁月就像是魔鬼一般
it's that the past is the devil.

124

你无法逃避 它总是在你身後
You can't run from it. It's always behind you.

办得如何？ 很好

133
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,758
他是位大客户
He's chomping at the bit to get the cargo.

139
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,023
说是两小时 卸货再装货 包括加油

140
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,776
然後 再23小时回来

00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,656
还不错
Is good.

143
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,200
去拿车
Go and get the car.

144
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,204
( Cell phone chiming, beeps )

145
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,455
谁？
Da?

146
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,958
我来谈条件
I am calling to negotiate terms.

147
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,794
他妈的是谁？
Who the fuck is this?

148
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,046
米哈伊尔 我的父亲常告诉我
Mikhail, my father always told me,

149
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,215
不要问原因 你已经知道答案
never ask a question you already know the answer.

150
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,717
你在浪费我他妈的时间
You waste my fucking time.

151
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,094
你以为我死了 不是吗？
You thought I was dead, didn't you?

152
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,930
狄曼
( Mutters ) Demyan.

153
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:31,435
瞧 米哈伊尔 现在控制权在我手里
Look, Mikhail, I hold the reins now.

154
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,855
幸运的是 你和我 都在起跑点
And fortunately for both you and I, we are at the reset point.

155
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,566
所以 我想我们最好尽快谈判
So I figure it's best we negotiate terms swiftly

156
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,484
还是要血光相见
while there's still blood in the water.

157
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,070
我正在听着
Da. I'm listening.

158
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,783
或者你爬进弗拉德的坟墓把自己活埋
You crawl into Vlad's grave and bury yourself alive,

159
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,537
我会找到你 我会杀了你
or I will find you and I'll kill you

160
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,248
我会亲自将你活埋
and I'll bury you myself.

161
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,877
这些都是我的条件
Those are my terms.

162
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,086
( Beeps )

163
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,268
( woman screaming )

(grunting )

165
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,924
现在怎麽办？
What now?

166
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,093
我们打到他的要害 换他们反击了
We hit them harder than they hit us.

167
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,054
我要大开杀戒
I am going to unleash hell.

168
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,890
去
Go.

169
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:55,227
我们要认真考虑 要聪明点
We need to think this through. We need to be smart.

170
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,604
我要毁了他
I'm going to destroy him.

171
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,732
是啊 和狄曼开战要先通过里欧这关
Yeah, but we go to war with Demyan and we can't go through Leo.

172
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:05,195
他的清道夫搞砸了 没杀掉狄曼及弗拉德
His cleaner screwing up and not eliminating Demyan as well as Vlad

173
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,614
这是我们被摆在首位的主因
is the reason we have the problem in the first place.

174
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,826
但他是城里的独行侠
But he's the only independent in town.

175
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,411
所以 你有什麽建议吗？
So what do you suggest?

176
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,498
你听说过狼人吗？
Did you ever hear of the Wolf?

177
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,376
( Chuckles )

178
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,877
他是一个神话
He's a fairy tale.

179
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:25,340
我听到的是 那不是神话
Tsk-tsk-tsk. The stories I hear, they're no fairy tale.

180
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:29,845
阿里波斯基有他的电话号码
Ari Perovsky has his number.

闭嘴
<i>-</i> Shut it. -( ringing )

186
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,742
什麽？ 他的名号叫狼人？
<i>- What? - Is this the man they call the Wolf?</i>

187
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,203
我喜欢用阿列克谢 但是 他们是同一个人
I prefer Aleksey, but yes, they're one and the same.

188
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,831
你明天可以来布拉格吗？
Can you be in Prague by tomorrow?

189
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,916
这时间有点匆促 老弟
That's a bit short notice there, mate.

190
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,127
我们加一倍的酬劳
We'll double your rate.

191
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:06,715
好吧 把地址给我 到时走人
Okay, text me an address. And until then, fuck off.

192
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,758
( Phone beeps )

193
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,928
对此深感抱歉
Sorry about that.

194
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,389
关於钱 你要交给斯利麦的...
Now about that money you be owin' Slim Jimmy...

195
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:18,768
所以 他们派狗咬人了
So, they sent a dog to collect their scraps.

196
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,273
其实 他们是派狼咬人
Actually they sent a wolf.

197
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,459

Fixer's voice: I've been watching her for a long time now.

216
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,145
我们就像两列火车在同一轨道上互相碰撞
We're like two trains on the same track headed for a collision course.

217

我一直不愿意处理
I've been reluctant to deal with it.

但迟早 如果我不这样做
But sooner or later, if I don't,

他会对付我
it will deal with me.

嗯 你好 雷
Well, hello, Ray.

226
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,423
一个下落不明
One unaccounted for.

227
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,258
是啊 所以有人告诉我
Yeah, so I was told.

228
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,845
嘿 伙计 他们要求是干掉米哈伊尔一个
Hey, man, Mikhail is the one who asked to make a show of it.

229
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,182
如果你不同意这些条件 你就不该接受这份工作 雷
If you didn't agree to the terms, you shouldn't have accepted the job, Ray.

230
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,808
公平的
Fair enough.

231
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,560
他不该拉一个女人挡在他前面
He shouldn't have pulled a woman in front of him.

232
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,395
她是一个妓女
She was a whore.

233
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:18,026
我们的工作只求结果而不是找藉口 雷 你知道的
We work on results, Ray, not excuses. You know that.

234
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,945
我会把狄曼干掉 我可以向你保证
I will finish with Demyan. I can promise you that.

235
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,364
你晚一天 钱就晚一天 我的朋友
You're a day late and a dollar short for that, my friend.

236
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,160
他们已经聘请了另一个杀手
They've already hired in another shooter for the job.

237
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,370
所以 是要我失信吗？
So where does that leave me?

238
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,832
我怀疑沙维洛先生的诚意
I strongly doubt that Mr. Mikhail Suverov

239
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:37,170
由於上次的失误 我必需尽快解决
will be requiring my services anytime soon due to this little fiasco.

240
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,882
他们很生气 这能怪谁呢？
They're angry, Ray. And who can blame them?

241
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,677
像沙维洛那种人太多了
There's a million like Suverov, just like him.

242
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,347
你想这是我提出的吗？
Why do you think I rang?

243
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:59,567
又要在我家後院放火了
Another gig in my own back yard doesn't exactly sit well with me, Leo.

244
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,570
而且 这看起来我们像是恩将仇报
Besides, this looks like we're biting the hand that feeds us.

245
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,365
如果没有他们 我们那来的工作 不是吗
Not if the hand isn't feeding you any more, it isn't.

246
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,450
狄曼想报复
Demyan wants to retaliate.

247
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,078
并愿意支付 远远超过沙维洛很多
And he's willing to pay a lot more than the Suverovs.

248
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,039
干掉那两兄弟 以及...
And hitting both brothers, well...

249
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,792
他将支付额外费用
he'll pay extra for that.

250
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:19,087
嘿 雷 这里已经引发战争了
Hey, Ray? We started a war here.

251
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,506
战争对生意是有利的
Wars are good for business.

252
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:25,218
所以 赚多赚少可以加倍利用
So you can cash in or you can cash out.

253
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,845
决定权是你的
The choice is yours.

00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:34,847
一大杯玻璃装的冰水再加上一杯小酒 先生
A tall glass of ice water coupled with shots, sir.

285
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,265
一杯够吗？
Are you all right with shots?

286
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,643
我喜欢 说真的
I prefer it, in fact.

287
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,563
来自牙买加阿普尔顿村 30年的朗姆酒 先生
Appleton Estate, 30-year-old rum from Jamaica, sir.

288
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,483
我认为这样应该很完美了 先生
I think it would be perfect in here, sir.

289
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,408
我在找的推销高手 就在这里
I'm digging the sales pitch there, boyo.

290
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,743
给我弄来
I'll give it a go.

291
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,623
所以 我的朋友 我们何时开始呢？
So, my friend, how do we begin?

292
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,959
简介是不错的
Introductions would be nice.

阿列克谢
Aleksey.

296
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:14,887
至於我不幸的绰号 我宁愿你不用它
As for my unfortunate moniker, I'd rather you not use it.

297
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,806
该死的陈词滥调
It's so goddamn cliché.

298
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:20,184
是啊 总之阿列克谢 告诉我
Yeah, whatever. Aleksey, tell me,

299
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,729
你如何知道目前的情况
what do you know about the current state of play

300
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,605
在这黄金之城？
here in the Golden City?

301
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,941
像往常一样做生意
Same old, same old, I'd assume.

302
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,944
两种不同意见的各方
Two parties of different opinions

303
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,905
只管咬住对方的喉咙 不计较琐事
gnawing at each other's throats over trivialities.

304
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,201
我喜欢你的想法 我不认为...
<i>- I like the way you think. - I don't...</i>

305
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:41,205
想法 就是说一不二
think, that is. I simply do.

306
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,292
那你到底要怎麽做？
What exactly is it that you do?

307
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,793
( Sighs )

308
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,129
我在老菠洛麦公园玩象棋

I restore cars from the '70s, pinball machines from the '90s,

311
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:56,721
如果酬劳付得起
and if you pay me enough,

312
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:59,849
我可以杀掉任何在呼吸的人
I'll probably kill anything that breathes.

313
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,434
可以吗？
Probably?

314
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:06,731
没有所谓的无辜
As in no innocent party, mate.

315
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:10,234
无论躲在桌下的儿童或妇女
Kids are off the table regardless, but I have no problem with women.

316
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,944
我只得杀了他们
Although I only shoot them.

317
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,030
用你的手或对一个女人动刀
Using your hands or a blade on a lady

318
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:18,409
只是感到软弱而俗气 你知道吗？
just comes across as rather weak and rather tacky, you know?

319
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,161
这是合理的
That's fair enough.

320
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:27,168
那麽 是什麽 你要我做什麽？
So what is it that you want me to do?

321
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:32,298
造成混乱
Wreak havoc.

322
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,509
这是狄曼伊万诺夫
This is Demyan lvanov,

323
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:38,179
他是幕後老板格里戈里的副手
his underboss Grigori Rikoniev, and his number two.

325
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:47,313

Nicholi is the one that started this, so he's up first.

326
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,589
- ( Muffled gunfire ) - ( dull thud )

327
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,234
您好 尼克莱
Hello, Nicholi.

328
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,611
你是谁？
Who are you?

329
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,573
一只训练有素的猴子
A trained monkey.

330
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,830
但足以应付了
But well enough paid

331
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:48,374
小小的接触

00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,818
你在做什麽 雷？
What are you doing, Ray?

333
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,620
说正经的 该走了
Seriously, it's time to go.

334

我还没喝完饮料
I haven't finished my drink.

335
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,291
把酒喝完然後买单

336
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,376
( Belches )

337
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,170

哦 是啊 婊子？ 然後跟我走
Oh, yeah, bitch? Then I'm taking this with me.

341
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,972
你不能带走... 你他妈的...
<i>- You're not taking anything-- - Get your fucking--</i>

342
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,809
啊！ 放过他
- Ah! <i>-</i> Let go of him.

343
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,603
好吧 好吧 我要走了

<i>- I'm sorry about that. - No, no, no, no.</i>

347
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,576
没有用 覆水难收
No use crying over spilt milk.

348
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,371
呵呵 你是美国人
Huh. You're American.

349
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,122
是啊
Yeah.

350
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,541
给我几秒钟 好吗？ 不 没关系
<i>- Give me a sec, okay? - No, that's okay.</i>

351
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,086
不 让我来清洗 已是第二次
No, I'll take care of this. It'll just be a second.

352
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,546
用盐和少许苏打水 永远不会失败
Club soda and salt, works every time.

353
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,832
(bell ringing)

354
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,710
- ( cheering ) <i>-</i> ( machine fluttering )

355
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:59,588
( announcer speaking faintly )

356
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,176
首先 他们杀害了弗拉德 然後狄曼成为老板
First they killed Vlad, and then Demyan becomes boss.

357
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,179
但他很庆幸了 意外是他引起的？
But is he happy about his accidental promotion?

358
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,849
不 那混帐不值得赞赏
No. The bastard appreciates nothing.

359
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,767
嘿 他们一起在车臣出生入死
Hey, they served together in Chechnya.

360
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,894
弗拉德为狄曼挡子弹
Vlad took a bullet for Demyan.

361
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,063
他们是骨肉兄弟 那又如何？
<i>-</i> They were brothers in blood. - So what?

362
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,732
让我损失了一个人
Does that make me less of a man

363
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,067
就因为我在格罗兹尼没有杀掉那贱人？
because I didn't kill bitches with them in Grozny?

364
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,987
我意思是 我怎麽办？ 首先 我是老板的副手
I mean, what about me? First I'm the underboss's underboss,

365
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,322
接着老板死了 他们会如何处置我？
and then the boss dies and what does that make me?

366
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,867
我仍然是一个该死的副手
I'm still a fucking underboss.

367
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:31,787
生活全乱了套
Life is shit.

368
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,665
当你想喝时 杯子一半是空的 格里戈里
You always see the glass half empty when you drink, Grigori.

369
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:40,087
噢 顺便说一下 我的杯子是空的 利夫
Oh, by the way, my glass is empty, Liev.

370
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:43,674
告诉我 如果我一直担心你那该死的杯子
Tell me, if I always get to refill your fucking drinks,

371
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,926
那麽我算什麽呢？
then what does that make me?

372
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,096
一名副手
An underboss.

373
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:53,434
(thunder rumbling, rain pattering )

374
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,603
2号桌2人

377
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,068
8号桌3人

378
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,821
两个弹匣 每轮17发 共34发
Two clips, 17 rounds apiece, makes 34.

379
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:09,617
10人 每人3发 4发失手
10 men, three rounds apiece, four slated to miss.

380
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,755
喂！
Oi!

381
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,633
哪一位是可怜的格里戈里傻瓜？
Which one of you poor fools is Grigori?

382
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,849
你他妈的是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

383
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:02,711
所以左边只用三个弹匣
So the left's only three in the clip,

384
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,631
和右边...
and the right...

385
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,642
还有一个在房内
<i>- ( casing clatters ) - one in the chamber.</i>

386
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,898
这样很美满 不是吗？
It was a thing of beauty, no?

387
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,535
( Indistinct voice over speaker )

388
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,070
( soft music playing )

389
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:18,495
( sniffs )

390
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,373
还记得是什麽害死猫王的吗？
You know that shit that killed Elvis, right?

391
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,500
那该死的东西在这里 肯定在
This shit here definitely would.

392
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,461
( laughs )

393
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,798
如果能害死猫王 也会害死我 我并不想这样做
Well, if it killed Elvis, it could kill me and maybe I don't want to do it.

394
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:33,302
宝贝 放松 只是一种表达 来吧
Baby, relax. It's just an expression. Come on.

395
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:37,181
好 听起来不太好 你应该用别的表达
Well, it doesn't sound good. You should think of a different expression.

396
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:39,266
吸吧 他妈的 闭嘴
Just fucking do it. Shutup.

397
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,066
( Inhaling )

398
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:51,320
我告诉过你 对不对？
( laughs ) I told you, right?

399
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:02,623
宝贝
Baby?

400
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,541
真的害死了猫王吗？
What really did kill Elvis?

401
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:08,379
是什麽东西或药丸  他妈的我不知道
That? Pills, something. I don't know. Fuck.

402
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,973
你...  出去
<i>-</i> You. - Out.

403
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:25,437
你... 你为我们工作
You-- you worked for us.

404
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,982
现在不一样了
Not any more.

405
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,652
听着 不管是谁 他们付给你的
Look, whatever it is they're paying you,

406
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:34,280
米哈伊尔将增加一倍
Mikhail will double it.

407
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,658
好吗？ 三倍
Okay? He'll triple it.

408
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:47,876
不 等等 我的意思是...
No, wait. I mean...

409
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,587
我是他唯一的弟弟
I'm his only brother.

410
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:53,257
他应该再找一个
He should have had another.

411
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,641
是鲍比！是鲍比！
( crying ) It's Bobby! It's Bobby!

412

(grunts, girl yelps)

419
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:14,880
是
-( beeps ) - Yeah?

420
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:16,840
你他妈的是怎麽回事 安德烈？
What the fuck is going on, Andrei?

421
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:19,009
发生什麽事 告诉我最新的情况？
What's happened to my goddamn update?

422
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,720
是啊 里欧
Yeah, Leo--

423
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:24,473
昨晚里欧的人干掉了鲍比
Leo's man took care of Bobby last night.

424
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,517
和米哈伊尔？
And Mikhail?

425
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:30,646
据我了解 在他们赶到前几秒钟
From what I understand, he walked in only seconds after the job was done.

426
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,732
嗯 真他妈的漂亮
Hmm. This is fucking beautiful.

427
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:37,319
是啊 我听说米哈伊尔当时正在炒饭
Yeah, I hear it's really fucked Mikhail up.

428
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:40,531
他的弟弟当然该死
Of course it did. This was his brother.

429
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,574
他一直在寻找这小子
He's been looking out for this kid his whole life.

430
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:46,453
也许这时找那小子有点难
Maybe this time he should try looking out a little harder.

431
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,289
我...
I, uh...

432
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,959
我有坏消息
I got bits of bad news.

433
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:54,962
究竟是什麽坏消息 安德烈？
What exactly is bad news, Andrei?

434
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,966
他们杀害尼克莱德沃克
They hit Nicholi Dvorak.

435
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:00,509
什麽？
What?

436
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:04,972
警方发现他死在水池中 头部中枪
The police found him floating in the pool, 9mm to the head.

437
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:06,640
这又不是世界末日
It's not the end of the world.

438
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,892
我们另外找一位
We'll find somebody else to do the business with.

439
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:14,773
安德烈 是吗？ 这就是坏消息吗？
Andrei, is this it? This is the bad news?

440
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,652
尼克莱是不是腹背受敌
Nicholi isn't the only one who got hit.

441
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,655
你是什麽意思？ 还有谁？
What are you talking about? Who else?

442
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:25,492
赌场被人攻击
Somebody hit the booking house.

443
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,704
把他们都杀...
Killed everybody--

444
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,789
杀了所有的人
killed all the boys.

445
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:33,625
格里戈里？
Grigori?

446
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:38,797
格里戈里 利夫 他们全死了
Grigori, Liev-- everybody there dead.

447
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,099
我的钱怎麽办？
What about my money?

448
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:51,852
我不太清楚
I'm not sure.

449
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,479
你到底什麽意思？ 你不清楚？
What the fuck do you mean you're not sure?!

450
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,481
我刚刚得到的消息
I... I just got bits and pieces.

451
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,357
有许多警察
The cops were crawling out of the place.

452
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,152
我不能久留 但...  但是个屁
<i>- I couldn't stay for long, but-- - But nothing!</i>

453
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,989
找到那该死的钱 安德烈  是的 老板我明白 会的
<i>- Find my goddamn money, Andrei! - Yes, boss. I understand, yes.</i>

454
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:06,241
只要给我一些时间 打几个电话
Just give me some time to make some calls.

455
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,744
给我20分钟 我会马上给你回电话
Give me 20 minutes and I'll call you right back.

456
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,830
你只有10分钟
You've only got 10.

457
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,625
( Beeps )

458
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:41,026
( doorbell buzzes )

459
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:50,369
( buzzing )

460
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:01,880
( buzzes )

461
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:12,015
你好 你好
- H6Y- - H6Y-

462
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:13,850
你在这儿
There you are.

463
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,562
你离开时忘了你的外套
You left your jacket

464
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,898
哦 对 你怎麽找到我的？
Oh, right. How'd you find me?

465
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:23,485
哦 我在你口袋里找到的
Oh. I found this in your pocket.

466
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:29,199
地址  很好
- ( Chuckles ) <i>-</i> Address. Nice.

467
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,951
顺便说一下 洗乾净了
It's clean, by the way.

468
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,578
哦 那多少钱？
Oh. How much do I owe you?

469
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,247
不 没有必要 我自己洗的 很好
No, no, no. I did it myself. It's good.

470
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:37,499
很幸运 信封上的地址是正确的
Lucky for me, the right address was in the envelope,

471
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,418
因为没有你的名字
because it didn't have your name.

472
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,753
我叫 雷  哦
- I'm Ray. - Oh.

473
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,423
只有 雷？ 雷卡弗
<i>- Just Ray? - Ray Carver.</i>

474
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:48,176
我叫贾尼丝 很抱歉打扰你了
I'm Janice. Look, I'm sorry for just stopping by.

475
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:51,305
只是想谢谢你 你知道 你那麽就快离开 我...
I just wanted to say thank you. You know, you took off so fast, I--

476
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,974
不 我很高兴你来 我...
No, I'm glad you did. I--

477
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:55,559
我想我欠你一个人情
I guess I owe you one.

478
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:57,644
哦！是吗？
Oh! yeah?

479
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:59,688
好吧
Okay.

480
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:02,441
那麽 在这种情况下 嗯...
Well, in that case, um...

481
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,693
嗯
Mmm.

482
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,490
同意
Fair enough.

483
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,743
那麽 期望下次在见
Well, hopefully I'll-- I'll talk to you soon.

484
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,453
但愿如此
Hopefully.

485
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,789
再见
Bye.

486
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:25,631
糟糕
( Sighs ) Shit.

487
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,758
把自己锁在门外
Did you lock yourself out?

488
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,385
不 我很好 再见
Nope, I'm good. See ya.

489
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,721
好吧
Okay.

490
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:02,626
所以...
So...

491
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:04,503
还有需要我效劳的吗？
am I still on the payroll?

492
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,088
嗯
Hmm.

493
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,256
你要我做什麽？
What would you have me do?

494
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:11,927
如果照我的方式
If it were my way,

495
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:14,805
我要你夷平这个城市
I would have you raze this city to the ground

496
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:18,183
侵蚀每寸土地
and salt every inch of it.

497
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:21,812
我答应过我的弟弟
But I made a promise to my brother

498
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:26,274
要有智慧 把事情搞定
to be smart, to think things through.

499
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:30,028
跟我来
Come with me.

500
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,005
米哈伊尔
Mikhail.

501
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,133
里欧
Leo.

502
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,305
嘿 阿列克谢
Hey, Aleksey.

503
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,308
我听说你在城里
I heard you were in town.

504
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:04,938
他非常昂贵 但他是值得的
He's very expensive, but he's worth it.

505
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,523
你们两个熟识吗？
You two have met?

506
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,983
( Chuckles )

507
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,362
比方说 我们同时行动 在一个圆圈圈
Let's just say that we both run in similar circles.

508
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:15,657
我为何在这里 米哈伊尔？
Why am I here, Mikhail?

509
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:19,119
你的孩子 不管他是谁
Your boy, whoever he is,

510
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:22,038
他没有把狄曼干掉
he didn't finish the job with Demyan,

511
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,916
但他肯定打到我的痛处
but he sure hit a home run

512
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,377
当他杀害我弟弟时
when he killed my brother.

513
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:32,090
到底我们在谈论的是那一个小孩？
Now exactly which boy are we talking about?

514
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:35,969
鲍比的女友 那个黑人私生子
Bobby's girl saw the black bastard.

515
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,846
来吧 里欧 诚实点
Come on, Leo, be honest.

516
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:41,725
城里有多少老奸计滑的人??？
How many monkeys are there in this city?

517
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:48,273
玩弄双方 是一个非常危险的游戏 朋友
Playing both sides is a very dangerous game, my friend.

518
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,526
我想知道他的名字
I want to know his name

519
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:54,362
在那里睡觉
and I want to know where he sleeps.

520
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,574
算了吧 米哈伊尔 撒泡尿去吧
Come on, Mikhail, you're taking a piss.

521
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,618
有多少钱就办多少事
What sort of handler would I be

522
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:02,913
要我泄漏杀手名字 那是我的资产 不是吗？
if I kept tossing out the names of my assets, eh?

523
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,915
你不尊重我
You disrespect me.

524
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:08,251
你很幸运还活着！
You are lucky to be alive!

525
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:11,129
你接受我弟弟的条件
You accepted the contract for my brother.

526
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:14,299
这导至你与他的死有关
That makes you directly involved in his death.

527
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:18,887
你应该考虑自己 他妈的是否够幸运
You should be counting your fucking blessings that I am asking you.

528
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:22,891
那黑人私生子已不是我的人
My black bastard isn't mine any more.

529
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,856
他并不是光靠我过活的
Not since he cost me my livelihood with you.

530
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:33,568
得了吧 米哈伊尔 你是我最好的客户
Come on, Mikhail! You're my best client.

531
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:35,779
你以为我那麽愚蠢吗？
Do I look that stupid?

532
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,699
如果你骗我 我就砍了你他妈的头
If you're lying to me, I'll cut your fucking head off.

533
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:42,619
我不会怀疑你的 米哈伊尔
I don't doubt you, Mikhail.

534
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:45,705
我们合作很久了
I've known you for a long time.

535
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:50,460
你能告诉我有关他的一切
You tell me everything you know about this boy.

536
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:56,800
我会告诉你一件事
I will tell you one thing--

537
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,428
如果你要找他
if you go looking for him,

538
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,765
他会先找到你 我保证
he'll find you first. I promise you.

539
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:14,794
不是他
That's not him.

540
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,509
- ( Siren wailing ) -( honking )

541
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:05,178
( indistinct police radio )

542
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,186
( phone beeps )

543
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:18,274
( ringing )

544
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,069
超过10分钟了
This is longer than 10 minutes.

545
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:24,698
对不起 我不得不打电话给警方的一个朋友
I'm sorry. I had to reach out to a friend of mine at the department.

546
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:25,991
这很不容易
It wasn't easy.

547
00:55:30,537 --> 00:55:32,288
然後呢？
And?

548
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,624
警察把钱带走了
The cops took the money.

549
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:36,751
在警局证物室里
They have it in evidence downtown.

550
00:55:39,129 --> 00:55:41,381
我还没完全查清楚
I did find out, though,

551
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:43,425
但是我发现有一位幸存者
that there was a survivor at the betting room,

552
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:45,969
他看到了整个事情
one of the bookies. He saw the whole thing.

553
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:48,763
据他说 是一个彪形大汉
According to him, this huge guy

554
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,598
来到右边的前门
came right to the front door,

555
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:54,185
呼叫格里戈里 快速的拿出2支枪
called out Grigori, whipped out two 9mms

556
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,146
并开枪射击
and started blazing.

557
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,857
只一个人吗？ 胡说八道 安德烈
One guy? This is bullshit, Andrei.

558
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:02,235
什麽胡说 他所描述的甚至更疯狂
What the bookie said he looked like is even crazier.

559
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,653
你是什??麽意思？

嘿 关於她你早该告诉我了
Hey, you should have told me about her before.

725

我们其实是天生一对
We are actually getting rat-assed together.

我过分吗？
Did I overdo it?

735
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:39,440
取决於他是否愿意现身
Depends on whether or not he shows.

736
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:44,361
他会现身 相信我 你不会失望
