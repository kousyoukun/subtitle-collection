11
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:03,699
Three days have passed since
the hostilities at JSA.

12
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,069
Efforts to hold a joint investigation
between the Koreas have failed,

13
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,506
but recently negotiators
achieved a key breakthrough.

14
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:14,511
Authorities from both countries
have agreed this afternoon

15
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:18,481
to comply with an
investigation by the NNSC.

16
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,643
Tensions have been 
running high

17
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,449
amid suspicions of a
Northern nuclear program

18
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:28,516
and the advance of U.S.
naval vessels into the East Sea.

19
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:34,657
Both Koreas recognize 
the need

20
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:39,864
to handle the recent conflict
calmly and objectively,

21
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:45,968
and to avoid having this
trivial matter escalate into war.

22
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:49,605
In accordance with the agreement,
the NNSC is planning to dispatch

23
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,242
Swiss and Swedish law officers
with experience in this field.

24
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:10,175
If a battle starts,
shoot the bastards.

25
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:12,112
You couldn't kill even one?

26
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:14,378
You call yourself a soldier?

27
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:18,886
I thought my primary mission
was to rescue Sergeant Lee.

28
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:19,787
So?

29
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:24,119
So that's why you
couldn't aim straight?

30
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,160
Was your order to
shoot down trees?

31
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,995
My order was to scare them off
and give cover to the rescue team.

32
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:29,863
What?

33
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:34,804
You sure you weren't
the one scared off?

34
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,433
I didn't want to start a war, sir.

35
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,875
What? 
A soldier afraid of war?

36
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:42,004
You stupid...

37
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:44,782
What?

38
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:50,319
Reporting, sir!

39
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:00,962
War doesn't break out 
that easily.

40
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:01,964
Now go.

41
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,035
Yes, sir!

42
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,770
This incident...

43
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:13,072
...isn't it rather obvious?

44
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,372
Some commies 
kidnap our soldier,

45
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,511
and claim he crossed over voluntarily.

46
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:23,815
Am I right?
Correct, sir!

47
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:28,087
Our boy... 
what's your name again?

48
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,329
Sergeant Lee Soo Hyuk, sir!
Right, Soo Hyuk.

49
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:36,367
Let's wrap this up quickly so Soo Hyuk
can take a leave of absence.

50
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:41,872
Our boy here took out
two of the bastards.

51
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,373
He's a hero!

52
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:46,735
Wouldn't you say, 
Major Jean?

53
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:50,412
Your opinion will be noted
in the investigation.

54
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:57,616
The NNSC will now be
taking custody of the suspect.

55
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:03,687
No South Korean military officials
may enter without my permission.

56
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,973
Neutral Nations
Supervisory Commission?

57
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,011
There are two kinds
of people in this world.

58
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,843
Commie bastards...

59
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,815
and the Commie 
bastards enemies.

60
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,552
Neutral has no place here.

61
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,479
You have to choose sides.

62
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,415
You're from law school, right?

63
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,154
I trust you'll make a wise choice.

64
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,528
I'm Major Sophie Jean 
from Switzerland.

65
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,970
This is Captain Perrson 
from Sweden.

66
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,943
He's still in shock.

67
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,809
He was hit with a blunt object.

68
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,385
That bruise proves
that he was kidnapped.

69
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:12,352
- Deposition -

70
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:53,164
Get down!

71
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:55,492
He looks like one of ours!

72
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,140
Soo Hyuk! 
Soo Hyuk!

73
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,504
Right over the
Military Demarcation Line.

74
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,438
Doesn't it seem a bit acted out?

75
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:21,884
This is where Lieutenant
Choi's body was found.

76
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:29,419
And that's where Private Jung fell.

77
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:34,929
A basement bunker...

78
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:51,804
Private Jung was a talented artist.

79
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:55,614
He even won a prize 
in a national contest.

80
00:12:56,487 --> 00:13:02,221
He was popular among the soldiers
for drawing their girlfriends.

81
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:03,657
RICE IS COMMUNISM

82
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:08,393
As soon as Lee Soo Hyuk
left our post,

83
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,867
Southern soldiers
stormed in as if on cue.

84
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:16,968
It's a good thing that
Sergeant Oh survived.

85
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,943
Otherwise the South would
go on spouting lies,

86
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,742
calling it a
North Korean provocation.

87
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:27,276
That's exactly what
they're saying now.

88
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,580
Who's going to believe it?

89
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,417
We have a witness.

90
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:41,053
Don't get up.

91
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,726
This is Major Jean 
from the NNSC.

92
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,834
Are you okay?

93
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:57,875
No big deal. It's nothing.

94
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:03,349
This is from a terrorist in Libya.

95
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,082
Sliced me with his knife.

96
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:10,217
Once in Egypt, I had to scrape
out shrapnel with a gun spike.

97
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:11,556
Wanna see?

98
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,029
Really?

99
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,001
Shall we take a look?

100
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm glad you're okay.

101
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,307
Now then, can you
tell me about that night?

102
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,515
It's all in my deposition.

103
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:40,522
You mean the deposition you made 
and signed while barely conscious?

104
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:45,761
Stupid wench.

105
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,630
What did you just say?

106
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:57,134
Why is it you all have depositions,
but nobody will talk to me?

107
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,810
Hey Lieutenant,
tell us about your vacation.

108
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:08,412
It was the same as any other.

109
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,849
It was nothing special.

110
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:40,307
Get down!

111
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,064
Shot twice.

112
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:33,229
Once in the right chest,

113
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:36,068
crushing the ribs
and passing through the lung.

114
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,235
But that wasn't the fatal shot.

115
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,578
The second one 
was the real killer.

116
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:57,289
Judging from the angle,
it was shot at point blank.

117
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,286
As for the next one...

118
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:30,121
A total of eight shots.

119
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,128
Unbelievable...

120
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,525
Shot from such a close range,
they went right through him.

121
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:40,503
The first shot hit his face,
probably killing him instantly.

122
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:45,201
The rest were just
shot into a dead body.

123
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,992
Lee Soo Hyuk.

124
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,369
Now there's a man.

125
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,103
I can see that.

126
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,073
Once while he was on duty,

127
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,512
those guys over there
cursed our president.

128
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,880
When Soo Hyuk heard this,

129
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,852
He took a rock and
smashed their window.

130
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:34,522
So I rounded up my
men and then told him

131
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,827
''All right! Way to go!''

132
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:41,324
Once he got left behind
on a search mission.

133
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,931
Man, the squad was in uproar.

134
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:49,636
Four hours later 
he shows up again.

135
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:55,944
Says he stepped on a mine
and had to dismantle it.

136
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:57,410
Damn!

137
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:00,746
Anyway, I knew then.

138
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,253
This guy, he's something else.

139
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,223
Nerves of steel, I tell you.

140
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,624
Nam Sung Shik,

141
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:15,359
you were on duty with Sergeant
Lee on the day of the incident.

142
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,197
Right?
Yes, ma'am!

143
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,171
I'm not deaf.

144
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,765
Why did Sergeant Lee 
go out alone?

145
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,709
An urgent call of nature.

146
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:33,541
Can a soldier leave
his post for that?

147
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:40,654
He said people with constipation

148
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:43,319
should seize a chance
when it comes.

149
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,126
Please load the gun
as you would normally.

150
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:56,189
So you refuse to say anything?

151
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:02,638
I visited the North side
and saw the corpses.

152
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,213
If you just wanted to escape,
why shoot a man 8 times?

153
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:14,874
I brought photos of the bodies.
Do you want to see them?

154
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,184
No.

155
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:18,587
I don't want to see them.

156
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:22,617
You've got a nice voice.

157
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:08,468
Your fellow soldiers say you're
very quick with the gun.

158
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,029
Are you really that fast?

159
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,597
Will you show me?

160
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:18,375
What's important in
battle isn't speed.

161
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:25,581
It's carrying yourself
with composure and bravery.

162
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:27,583
That's everything.

163
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:30,983
Alright, then.

164
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:35,130
Can you load the gun
again, just like before?

165
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,333
Are you really a Swiss soldier?

166
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:53,606
Does Sergeant Lee talk much
about army life?

167
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:59,010
He tries to, but I don't let him.

168
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:02,086
Has he ever talked
about, for example...

169
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,287
How he went
on any missions,

170
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,023
or if he got special training?

171
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:09,260
Special training?

172
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:12,902
Can you zip me up?

173
00:23:14,004 --> 00:23:18,065
Soo Jung, you don't
worry about Sergeant Lee?

174
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,710
We're not really that serious.

175
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:29,050
What kind of person is he, 
in a word?

176
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,251
Well...

177
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:35,759
Oh, you can tell by
how he treats my brother.

178
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:40,263
Since we were kids my brother
never had many friends.

179
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:44,267
But after enlisting, things got
much better, thanks to Soo-Hyuk.

180
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:47,065
He's very warm-hearted.

181
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:49,970
Probably because he grew
up poor, like us.

182
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,940
Wait a second...

183
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,567
Your brother?

184
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,111
You didn't know?

185
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:58,876
Private Nam Sung Shik,
they're in the same platoon.

186
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:02,885
He kept asking me to
meet Soo Hyuk, so I did.

187
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:11,919
What?

188
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,392
Is there something on my face?

189
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:17,661
No, not at all.

190
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:45,789
There were 11 bullet wounds on
the three North Korean soldiers.

191
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:49,091
10 bullets were recovered 
at the scene,

192
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,259
but one was never found.

193
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:53,526
It's a missing bullet.

194
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,475
There were 5 left in your gun.

195
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:04,570
If you add these up,
5 and 10 make 15.

196
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:09,074
Since you aren't in the habit
of loading an extra bullet,

197
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:13,453
15 matches the number
you had to begin with.

198
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:14,889
Then,

199
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,020
what's this one bullet?

200
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:22,630
It was neither shot by you
nor recovered later.

201
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:25,167
Yet it pierced through
a soldier's body.

202
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:31,569
If someone hid the bullet,

203
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:35,100
it means he's afraid it might
reveal whose gun fired it.

204
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,847
In other words,
there was someone else,

205
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:40,406
a fifth person at the scene.

206
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,083
What do you think 
of my theory?

207
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:55,388
Sometimes they set fires on
the DMZ for good visibility.

208
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,495
One night we burned
a reed field.

209
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:07,902
And all the mines blew up 
like fireworks.

210
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:10,947
Then, another time...

211
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:13,881
Was Private Nam 
with you then, too?

212
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:27,288
This is the beretta you had
when you were rescued.

213
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:31,467
Everyone assumed that
this was your gun.

214
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,569
I requested an inquiry
on the serial number.

215
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:40,439
This gun belongs to Private Nam.

216
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:47,508
Pvt. Nam said his gun broke during
the rescue and fired only once.

217
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:53,584
The beretta M-9 is an automatic,

218
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:57,093
so the slide cocks back
after each shot.

219
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,724
It broke right here.

220
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:04,167
You know all this, right?
You're the weapons expert.

221
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:08,501
I inspected the gun registered to
you that Private Nam returned.

222
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:17,109
Antimony-barium reaction on the
gun revealed more than gunpowder.

223
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:18,478
Bloodstains.

224
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:32,160
After the first shot, the slide
retracted and then stuck.

225
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:40,298
And blood from a body
splattered right here.

226
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,974
and blood splattered
right here.

227
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:50,944
The analysis results matched
with Private Jung's blood sample.

228
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,518
The bloodstains right here...

229
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:59,784
weren't visible, and so they
weren't wiped off.

230
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:09,260
Sergeant Lee, have you heard
of the Keeler Polygraph

231
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,833
Also known as a lie detector.

232
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:29,910
Yes?

233
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,580
Thank you.

234
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:11,006
Here's checkpoint 2.

235
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:15,375
And this is checkpoint 3?

236
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:18,819
Hey, what are the
coordinates here again?

237
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:21,724
If we're here...

238
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,282
We're at checkpoint 3, sir.

239
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:28,460
Those coordinates aren't 
on the map.

240
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:47,276
Are you saying we crossed over?

241
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:51,578
Give me that.

242
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,732
We're fucked.

243
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,972
Retreat quickly, 5 o'clock!

244
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:57,786
Sergeant Hwang!

245
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,357
Sergeant Choi!

246
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:06,128
Help me...

247
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,836
I told you not to bring that
damn dog, you stupid shit!

248
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:04,937
I didn't bring him!

249
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:06,380
You shut up.

250
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,314
I'm stepping on a mine.

251
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:14,220
We could all die.

252
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,424
Watch out! Careful, there...

253
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:20,821
Don't come any closer!

254
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:24,963
One more step, 
and I'll trip the wire.

255
00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:38,977
Hey assholes!

256
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:40,977
You just gonna leave me here?

257
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:46,221
You told us to go.

258
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:53,056
I said don't come closer, when did
I say to leave, you fuckers!

259
00:35:57,934 --> 00:35:59,561
Save me!

260
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:09,272
A grown man,
crying like a baby...

261
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:28,064
Sergeant Oh!

262
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:30,793
What if...

263
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:36,802
Let's just go.

264
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:37,237
Okay?

265
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:43,545
Take it.
It's a gift.

266
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:09,697
Let's go.

267
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,972
You too, puppy.

268
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:18,171
Watch yourself now.

269
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:22,882
About that mine...
Don't even talk to me.

270
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,580
What?
Just out to save yourself...

271
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:28,351
Well, it was just...

272
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,430
Rabbit...

273
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,372
Rabbit!

274
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:55,516
We got your rabbit's
dick right here!

275
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:42,188
Hey, hey.

276
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,185
Your shadow's over the line.

277
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:47,229
Watch it.

278
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,011
You writing to Soo Jung?

279
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:11,111
Yeah.

280
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:24,932
I didn't thank you for
your help last time.

281
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:27,936
It was rude of me, brother.

282
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:29,403
Oh, can I call you brother?

283
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:31,531
I've always wanted a brother.

284
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:35,270
''After hearing “comrade” 
all the time,

285
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,678
it's nice to be called brother.''

286
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:41,581
''My hobby is baseball.

287
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:44,779
I was a pitcher in high school.''

288
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:55,190
''I'm enjoying the tape 
you sent me.

289
00:40:55,264 --> 00:41:00,702
Han Dae Su was hard to take
at first, but I like it now.

290
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,398
Kim Hyun Shik is good, too.

291
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,106
But don't you have any
female singers down there?''

292
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:28,550
I didn't mean it...

293
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:32,583
I thought I'd write to
him too, as a joke...

294
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:35,392
I never thought he'd actually come.

295
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:38,593
What kind of a crazy fool would...

296
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:43,738
Good-bye, then.

297
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,840
Wait, I didn't mean for you to go.

298
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,039
You've done a great thing.

299
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,344
After half a century of division,

300
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,389
you have breached our tragic history
of agony and disgrace,

301
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:05,621
broken the dam to reunify our country. 
Comrade Lee Soo Hyuk!

302
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:07,026
We welcome you.

303
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:16,935
I'm sorry.

304
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,251
You got a promotion?

305
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:39,783
Thanks to me you've lived
to become sergeant, right?

306
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:42,023
If I died, I'd have moved
up to staff sergeant.

307
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:45,499
Imagine if I'd had the nerve
to remove my foot?

308
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:47,593
I'm the one who saved your lives.

309
00:43:47,737 --> 00:43:49,898
You're full of shit.

310
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:53,097
Move your army out of the way.

311
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:56,612
Then we can go head to head
with those damn Yankees.

312
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,543
Only two years and two months?

313
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:04,985
Damn, we serve for 13 years!

314
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:09,023
I'm pretty quick with the gun.

315
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:12,549
I'm bored all the time
so I practice a lot.

316
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,596
That water pistol?

317
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:17,929
Hey, just quit pissing
your pants around mines.

318
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:37,079
Yeah, you're pretty fast.

319
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:43,451
But have you...

320
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:56,533
ever shot a man before?

321
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:58,634
No.

322
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:02,010
I have, several times.
Alright.

323
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:09,009
Okay.
Please Stop.

324
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,110
Our comrade's been everywhere

325
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:18,559
Africa, the Middle East...
He trained soldiers for 10 years!

326
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,061
You didn't know, did you?

327
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:20,891
That's right, huh?

328
00:45:21,297 --> 00:45:26,064
Hey, Sergeant Lee.

329
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:29,667
What's important in battle isn't speed.

330
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:32,071
Combat skills? No such thing.

331
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:38,243
It's carrying yourself
with composure and strength.

332
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:40,441
That's everything.

333
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:48,816
Then what's a great soldier like you
doing guarding this post at your age?

334
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:58,465
Hey! You still have that
mine fuse I gave you?

335
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:00,195
Don't lose it.

336
00:46:00,936 --> 00:46:03,928
A Hold onto that and
even bullets will pass you by.

337
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:33,826
Whoa!

338
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:38,468
Why do you always go
crazy over American things?

339
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:42,171
Try it, and you'll see
why Yankee stuff is so great.

340
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:44,973
Must've been expensive.

341
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:50,213
It's also good for picking
stuff out of your teeth.

342
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,399
Lay down.

343
00:47:06,635 --> 00:47:08,398
I said lay down!

344
00:47:33,963 --> 00:47:35,624
See?

345
00:47:35,698 --> 00:47:39,065
I told you 
about this American shit...

346
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:52,041
What are you doing there
away from your post?

347
00:47:52,114 --> 00:47:54,639
It's not that, we were...

348
00:47:54,717 --> 00:47:56,048
You idiot!

349
00:47:59,221 --> 00:48:03,658
You think you're something
because you've been abroad?

350
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,508
You think this is a playground?

351
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:22,601
You're at the very front line
of our republic! The front line!

352
00:48:23,646 --> 00:48:27,548
Hey. Take that damn
dog to the butchers.

353
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:28,605
Lunch for tomorrow.

354
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:29,616
What?!

355
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:34,453
Our people count on us.

356
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:39,489
Don't let them down, okay?

357
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,302
Take care of yourself.

358
00:48:58,714 --> 00:48:59,942
Go on.

359
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,714
Watch out for landmines.

360
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,722
Go!

361
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:15,423
I said go!

362
00:49:18,434 --> 00:49:19,458
Hey! Hey!

363
00:49:19,535 --> 00:49:23,767
There's more food
on the other side!

364
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:29,301
That guy's so funny.

365
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:32,044
Sergeant Lee.

366
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:41,985
You're really handsome.

367
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,092
Tell me something I don't know.

368
00:49:46,128 --> 00:49:51,065
Spit it out.
You expect me to read your mind?

369
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:55,902
Must be nice. Only three
months left to serve.

370
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:58,300
Nope, 87 days.

371
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:06,445
I'm worried about the
rest of my time here.

372
00:50:12,454 --> 00:50:16,390
Hey, you want me to introduce
you to some friends?

373
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:19,788
Who?

374
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:25,696
Nah...

375
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:28,066
Forget it.

376
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:50,450
Do I have to go?

377
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:52,386
What?

378
00:51:54,757 --> 00:51:59,626
Hey, after half 
a century of division...

379
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:05,861
Um... overcoming our history
of agony and disgrace,

380
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:11,329
We're gonna open the dam
to reunification. Okay?

381
00:52:12,274 --> 00:52:14,640
Could we maybe open it later?

382
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,822
I've heard a lot about you.

383
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,014
I'm Oh Kyung Pil.

384
00:52:39,702 --> 00:52:42,068
Hey. Private Nam.

385
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,050
You feel warm.

386
00:53:19,808 --> 00:53:23,073
Ah! Feels warm.

387
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:32,049
Sergeant Lee.

388
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:41,092
Come on.

389
00:53:41,163 --> 00:53:45,429
What's wrong with people
of the same blood

390
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:48,470
getting together and
playing some games?

391
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:52,132
Is that such a crime?
I mean, did we commit adultery?

392
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:54,675
Or give up military secrets?

393
00:53:55,644 --> 00:53:57,475
We don't even know any secrets.

394
00:53:57,546 --> 00:53:58,740
Exactly!

395
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:21,395
Southern army...

396
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:22,953
Out of the way...

397
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:23,963
That's it!

398
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:36,845
Damn! I told you we
should use pebbles!

399
00:55:37,112 --> 00:55:39,706
What's so hard about this?

400
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:45,820
Wow! It's standing!

401
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:07,440
Brother.

402
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:09,602
Pay up.

403
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:19,915
My father died young.

404
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:22,479
So I'm the only man in the house.

405
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,160
Wow...

406
00:56:27,229 --> 00:56:28,560
She's pretty.

407
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:31,163
Is she really yours?

408
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:38,606
Don't you have anyone, brother?
Come on, show us!

409
00:57:44,406 --> 00:57:47,739
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

410
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:53,578
But remember what
that soldier who defected said?

411
00:57:53,648 --> 00:57:58,210
Guards at the border are trained
to draw us to their side.

412
00:57:59,488 --> 00:58:01,388
You're wrong.

413
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,790
He saved my life.

414
00:58:26,959 --> 00:58:28,290
Brother.

415
00:58:29,528 --> 00:58:35,296
Why can't our republic make
moon pies like this?

416
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:40,196
Brother!

417
00:58:44,176 --> 00:58:47,703
I was just wondering...

418
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:51,506
Don't you want to come down South?

419
00:58:58,524 --> 00:59:03,223
You can eat Choco Pies
till you burst.

420
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:13,094
I mean, only if you want to.

421
00:59:19,078 --> 00:59:20,705
Lee Soo Hyuk.

422
00:59:20,779 --> 00:59:25,182
I'm only going to say
this once, so listen well.

423
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:29,816
My dream is...

424
00:59:29,888 --> 00:59:32,322
That one day, our republic...

425
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:37,055
makes the best damn
sweets on this peninsula.

426
00:59:37,629 --> 00:59:38,926
Got it?

427
00:59:45,871 --> 00:59:49,136
Until then, all I can do is...

428
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,336
dream about these Choco Pies.

429
00:59:55,814 --> 01:00:01,150
Forget it. You're all talk.

430
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:04,813
Stop it.

431
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,790
Don't!

432
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:10,191
Sung Shik, stop these
Commie bastards!

433
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:45,561
You don't need to rub it,
just wipe it on with this.

434
01:00:45,631 --> 01:00:47,030
Take them off.

435
01:00:49,268 --> 01:00:51,566
First, shake it well like this.

436
01:00:51,637 --> 01:00:54,663
Then you just spread it on.

437
01:00:57,242 --> 01:01:01,110
This is how you do it. Like this.

438
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,014
Then after it dries, do it again.

439
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:31,131
Alert! Alert!

440
01:01:33,445 --> 01:01:36,278
Hey! Hurry up over there!

441
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:40,680
Move your asses!

442
01:01:56,501 --> 01:01:58,696
At 02:35,

443
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:03,434
we obtained word that

444
01:02:03,508 --> 01:02:06,477
Northern troops are massing
along the entire border.

445
01:02:07,579 --> 01:02:09,274
We're at DEFCON 3.

446
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:27,031
Hey!
You chicken?

447
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:32,027
Keep your cool, okay?

448
01:02:32,104 --> 01:02:34,072
Just think of it as
shooting off a round.

449
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:36,972
That's all it is, alright?

450
01:04:25,684 --> 01:04:27,276
Sung Shik.

451
01:04:27,486 --> 01:04:32,355
Let's not go over anymore.

452
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:43,492
It'll be Jung's birthday soon.

453
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:45,559
And you're almost out.

454
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,070
We should at least say goodbye.

455
01:05:03,055 --> 01:05:06,024
After I'm out,

456
01:05:08,226 --> 01:05:11,252
don't ever go there alone.

457
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,520
Got it?

458
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:29,404
Brother, that day...

459
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:33,815
Was the North really
going to attack?

460
01:05:33,885 --> 01:05:35,614
How should I know?

461
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:41,583
The Yankees were about to bomb us.
We supposed to just sit there?

462
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:45,590
So don't make any
nuclear arms or missiles.

463
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:47,794
Hey, do I make them?

464
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,295
Why are you getting angry?

465
01:05:51,236 --> 01:05:53,898
Stop talking about war.

466
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:57,733
Everyone just write
a letter to your parents.

467
01:05:58,677 --> 01:06:00,440
And one to Soo Jung, too.

468
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:05,012
If war really broke out,

469
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,750
would we have to
shoot each other, too?

470
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:27,271
How about we write each
other certificates or something?

471
01:06:27,472 --> 01:06:31,568
''We hereby certify that Nam
Sung Shik served the republic.

472
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:35,602
Signed, Sergeant Oh Kyung Pil
and Private Jung Woo Jin.''

473
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,648
Something like that.

474
01:06:37,716 --> 01:06:41,083
That's good idea!
Right!

475
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,454
What a waste of time.

476
01:06:44,489 --> 01:06:47,720
If the Yankee bastards
play their war games,

477
01:06:48,527 --> 01:06:51,860
we'll be obliterated.
Zero.

478
01:06:52,797 --> 01:06:56,324
Three minutes in war, both
countries would be destroyed.

479
01:06:57,302 --> 01:07:01,500
A total wasteland.
Don't you get it?

480
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,668
I see.

481
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:14,448
Man, this song reminds me 
of my mom.

482
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:17,722
Tell me,

483
01:07:17,789 --> 01:07:22,055
Why did this singer
have to die so young?

484
01:07:24,162 --> 01:07:25,720
Hey!

485
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:29,726
Let's have a toast...

486
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:32,634
to singer Kwang Suk.

487
01:07:41,346 --> 01:07:43,143
[exchanging address]

488
01:07:58,196 --> 01:07:59,663
What?

489
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:02,460
Oh, nothing.

490
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:15,573
Hey, squeeze in.

491
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:21,212
Perfect.

492
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:46,805
Aren't you going?

493
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:50,804
We have to go.

494
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,710
Let's go.

495
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:09,092
Hey dummy.

496
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:14,070
I taught you once,
and you still can't do it?

497
01:09:15,407 --> 01:09:18,808
No matter what ,
I can't get it to shine.

498
01:09:19,511 --> 01:09:21,103
Let me see.

499
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:25,179
A soldier's has to get
it right the first time.

500
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,777
I can't do this for you forever.

501
01:09:32,023 --> 01:09:33,081
Oh, wait.

502
01:09:40,932 --> 01:09:42,399
Happy Birthday.

503
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:54,334
Thank you, comrade.

504
01:09:56,214 --> 01:09:57,704
Brother!

505
01:09:59,451 --> 01:10:01,146
Oh...damn!

506
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:07,618
You're crying!

507
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,726
I can't help it.

508
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:16,564
I have something
for you guys, too.

509
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:17,760
What?

510
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:30,178
Where'd it go?

511
01:10:33,518 --> 01:10:34,951
What is it?

512
01:10:44,262 --> 01:10:47,231
What the hell did you eat?

513
01:10:47,298 --> 01:10:50,199
Hey, open the door. 
Open it!

514
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:31,763
Yes.

515
01:12:31,836 --> 01:12:35,101
Yes.

516
01:12:35,173 --> 01:12:39,007
What?

517
01:12:40,478 --> 01:12:43,709
Why does he want to postpone
the cross-examination?

518
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:50,218
Then tell this to General Pyo.

519
01:12:51,422 --> 01:12:53,652
Whether Private Nam takes a leap,

520
01:12:53,725 --> 01:12:56,819
or Sergeant Lee falls
not shock, it's not my concern.

521
01:12:56,961 --> 01:12:59,521
I don't have time to
pamper the suspects.

522
01:12:59,597 --> 01:13:00,825
Understand?

523
01:14:51,242 --> 01:14:53,267
Here are your depositions.

524
01:14:53,344 --> 01:14:57,144
Read it and tell me if you
want to change anything.

525
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:06,186
Oh! I'm sorry.

526
01:15:17,235 --> 01:15:18,259
This is correct.

527
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:19,834
Yes.

528
01:15:31,783 --> 01:15:34,946
You recognize this?
It's the crime scene.

529
01:15:37,055 --> 01:15:38,215
Lieutenant Choi Man Soo.

530
01:15:39,957 --> 01:15:41,219
Sergeant. Oh Kyung Pil.

531
01:15:42,794 --> 01:15:44,887
And Private. Jung Woo Jin.

532
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,356
How many Southern
soldiers attacked the post?

533
01:15:50,101 --> 01:15:51,033
Only one.

534
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:53,637
Are you sure?

535
01:15:55,506 --> 01:15:56,700
I'm sure.

536
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,172
Alright.

537
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:05,245
This is Sergeant Lee Soo-Hyuk.

538
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,325
Do you recognize him?

539
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:23,296
A Southern puppet.

540
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,752
What is this?

541
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:45,283
What's going on here?

542
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:49,122
This is another soldier presumed
to have been at the scene.

543
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:52,794
He's in a coma, so
he couldn't make it today.

544
01:16:55,066 --> 01:16:56,829
Presumed?

545
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:59,131
With what evidence?

546
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:03,071
During his interrogation, when told
he would take a lie detector test,

547
01:17:03,141 --> 01:17:06,008
Private Nam attempted
suicide on the spot.

548
01:17:06,644 --> 01:17:09,670
We have no choice but to
consider this as a confession.

549
01:17:09,747 --> 01:17:14,343
Therefore, I propose we start
the investigation all over again.

550
01:17:14,418 --> 01:17:16,682
We didn't come here to
listen to your stories.

551
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:18,278
Please, stop!

552
01:17:45,283 --> 01:17:47,217
You son of a bitch!

553
01:17:51,656 --> 01:17:56,116
You capitalist bastard!
You know how long I've waited?

554
01:17:56,194 --> 01:17:57,889
Damn puppet!

555
01:17:57,962 --> 01:18:00,396
You know how long?

556
01:18:00,631 --> 01:18:04,533
Take your hands off!
I'll show you the power of our republic!

557
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:07,127
You capitalist pig!

558
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:30,650
Son of a bitch!
Traitor to the people!

559
01:18:30,728 --> 01:18:31,387
Yankee puppet!
Sergeant Oh!

560
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:35,694
Long live the Chosun 
Labor Party!

561
01:18:36,934 --> 01:18:38,765
Our honored leader...

562
01:18:38,836 --> 01:18:41,703
Long live 
Supreme Commander Kim Jong-Il!

563
01:24:38,829 --> 01:24:41,730
I'm sorry to make you come.
I know you're still ill.

564
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:49,138
This states my dismissal from the
JSA case from midnight tomorrow.

565
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,231
I heard about your father.

566
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:10,956
So you heard my father was
a North Korean general?

567
01:25:11,028 --> 01:25:13,553
How does that make you feel?

568
01:25:14,331 --> 01:25:15,889
Like a friend.

569
01:25:22,172 --> 01:25:24,663
I still have a bruise,

570
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,337
but you're clean.

571
01:25:31,148 --> 01:25:34,208
Your grip must be stronger
than Sergeant Oh's.

572
01:25:37,588 --> 01:25:41,547
Alright, the real show starts now.

573
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:42,956
Watch carefully.

574
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:52,396
As soon as I met Soo Jung,
I knew I had seen her face before.

575
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:57,436
And it wasn't hard to
figure out who she was.

576
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:02,701
This is a picture drawn
by Private Jung.

577
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,042
And this...

578
01:26:05,849 --> 01:26:08,841
This picture was found
on Private Jung's body.

579
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:14,953
If the missing bullet
broke Private Nam's alibi,

580
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:17,184
then this missing face

581
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:21,891
proves that the four soldiers
must have been friends.

582
01:26:29,473 --> 01:26:30,735
So?

583
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:36,106
These are two completely
different reports.

584
01:26:36,413 --> 01:26:39,576
Which one I submit is up to you.

585
01:26:45,255 --> 01:26:48,281
If you tell me the truth,

586
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:52,728
I won't leave any of this 
information for my successor.

587
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,265
Is that a threat?

588
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,667
It's a deal.

589
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:06,335
I don't care whether
I go to jail or get a medal.

590
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:09,436
So what can you offer me,

591
01:27:09,513 --> 01:27:11,640
if I tell you the truth?

592
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:19,113
Someone you tried
to protect till the end...

593
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:21,424
Sergeant Oh's safety.

594
01:28:13,744 --> 01:28:15,473
Comrade Choi, please calm down.

595
01:28:15,546 --> 01:28:17,013
I'll explain everything.

596
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:21,015
What's going on here?

597
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:23,984
Please, put the gun down.
You too, Soo Hyuk!

598
01:28:28,759 --> 01:28:30,590
You bastard!

599
01:28:30,928 --> 01:28:35,558
I put you on guard and you
screw around with these puppets?

600
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:37,930
Arrest them now!

601
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:44,339
They came here to discuss
coming to the North.

602
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:46,239
I'll take care of everything.

603
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:50,041
Hey, Jung Woo Jin!
This is a direct order.

604
01:28:50,113 --> 01:28:52,673
These scumbags are our enemies.
Disarm them now.

605
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:54,949
Shoot them!

606
01:28:58,589 --> 01:29:01,456
I'll take full responsibility.
Don't move!

607
01:29:01,692 --> 01:29:03,182
Do what I say now,

608
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,888
and I'll overlook
this treasonable act.

609
01:29:09,132 --> 01:29:10,565
Do it now!

610
01:29:13,537 --> 01:29:15,095
Comrade Oh, I'm sorry.

611
01:29:23,247 --> 01:29:25,010
Soo Hyuk.

612
01:29:25,082 --> 01:29:27,243
Put your gun down.

613
01:29:27,985 --> 01:29:29,919
There's no other way.

614
01:29:33,423 --> 01:29:34,151
No way.

615
01:29:36,059 --> 01:29:38,152
I'll help you come to the North.

616
01:29:38,228 --> 01:29:41,686
You can live with us
okay?

617
01:29:42,266 --> 01:29:43,597
Alright?

618
01:29:45,569 --> 01:29:47,400
Put the gun down first
and we'll talk.

619
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:48,699
Fuck that!

620
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:53,037
You know better. This
asshole can't be trusted.

621
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:57,274
You said it yourself,
that he's an ambitious prick.

622
01:29:57,347 --> 01:30:02,148
He'll kill us both and say we
infiltrated enemy territory.

623
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:04,187
I promise I'll protect you.

624
01:30:04,254 --> 01:30:06,722
You still don't trust me?

625
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:11,090
Sung Shik, you trust me.
Talk to him.

626
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:16,724
Could this be a trap?

627
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,665
Soo Hyuk, brother!

628
01:30:18,735 --> 01:30:23,672
You remember when Comrade Oh
saved you from the mine?

629
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,105
Don't you?

630
01:30:25,175 --> 01:30:28,338
Please put the gun down, okay?

631
01:30:32,015 --> 01:30:36,679
Fuck it!

632
01:30:36,753 --> 01:30:40,314
Fuck this 'brother' shit.

633
01:30:42,993 --> 01:30:45,120
We're enemies, after all.

634
01:30:56,473 --> 01:31:00,637
You said I was chicken, right?

635
01:31:00,711 --> 01:31:04,272
Fine, see if I can kill
this bastard or not.

636
01:31:04,348 --> 01:31:05,315
Just watch.

637
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:08,249
Hey, Soo Hyuk!

638
01:31:08,318 --> 01:31:12,414
We're all going to die this way.

639
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,848
Let's start over.

640
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:22,625
Put your guns down together.

641
01:31:22,699 --> 01:31:24,166
You too, Woo Jin!

642
01:31:32,376 --> 01:31:33,707
Just put them down.

643
01:31:35,979 --> 01:31:37,503
Down.

644
01:31:42,052 --> 01:31:43,986
Something's not right.

645
01:34:42,365 --> 01:34:44,196
Listen to me.

646
01:34:44,267 --> 01:34:45,791
Say you were kidnapped
and then escaped.

647
01:34:45,869 --> 01:34:48,337
You were never here.
Got it?

648
01:34:48,405 --> 01:34:50,669
Now go.
There's no time!

649
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:53,706
Go.

650
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:06,920
Soo Hyuk...

651
01:36:14,591 --> 01:36:16,081
Who the hell's that?

652
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,457
He looks like one of ours!

653
01:36:58,234 --> 01:36:59,326
Get down!

654
01:37:53,523 --> 01:37:55,491
Soo Hyuk! 
Soo Hyuk!

655
01:37:55,558 --> 01:37:57,924
Cover us!
You bastards!

656
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:11,407
Hurry up!

657
01:38:25,388 --> 01:38:26,650
Hold your fire!

658
01:38:26,723 --> 01:38:28,884
Cease fire!

659
01:38:40,904 --> 01:38:45,068
So that's how Private Jung
ended up dying on his birthday.

660
01:38:47,043 --> 01:38:49,238
I don't think about the dead.

661
01:38:53,249 --> 01:38:57,652
Do you think you can forgive
Private Nam and Sergeant Lee?

662
01:39:05,695 --> 01:39:07,185
May I have one?

663
01:39:24,848 --> 01:39:28,614
If this had happened
at a Southern post,

664
01:39:31,421 --> 01:39:33,787
I would've shot first.

665
01:39:45,368 --> 01:39:49,134
I heard you're being discharged.

666
01:39:51,508 --> 01:39:54,602
How does it feel
to leave Panmunjom?

667
01:40:04,053 --> 01:40:08,149
Sgt. Lee is being sent
to Yongsan Hospital today.

668
01:40:08,224 --> 01:40:11,352
Do you have a message for him?

669
01:40:39,255 --> 01:40:41,450
He's made good use of it.

670
01:40:41,524 --> 01:40:43,924
He said he's going
to quit smoking.

671
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:46,621
You know that missing bullet?

672
01:40:46,696 --> 01:40:50,860
Sgt. Oh threw it into the
reservoir with the cassette player.

673
01:40:55,405 --> 01:40:59,865
I guess I've left
a stain on your career.

674
01:41:01,144 --> 01:41:01,940
It doesn't matter.

675
01:41:03,112 --> 01:41:05,205
I chose to fail.

676
01:41:08,084 --> 01:41:11,485
Oh, there was one inconsistency
in Sgt. Oh's testimony.

677
01:41:12,589 --> 01:41:15,114
He said Pvt. Nam 
didn't kill Pvt. Jung.

678
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:17,022
It was you.

679
01:41:18,561 --> 01:41:19,926
It all happened so quickly,

680
01:41:19,996 --> 01:41:21,827
you must have remembered it wrong.

681
01:41:22,599 --> 01:41:24,658
Or Sergeant Oh made a mistake.

682
01:41:26,402 --> 01:41:30,736
But what does it matter who
shot a second quicker or later?

683
01:41:47,757 --> 01:41:51,523
I hope you get well soon.

684
01:45:07,323 --> 01:45:08,688
Thank you.
