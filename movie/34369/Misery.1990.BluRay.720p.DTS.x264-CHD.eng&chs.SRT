No. No, of course not.
不,当然不,只是 他的女儿也没有他的消息

146
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:50,529
It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him,

and, uh, when he has a new book coming out, he usually keeps in touch.

Oh, a little overprotective maybe,
只是稍微有点过于担心,但是 告诉你,我也会这样做

Oh, but, Paul, I don't think.

you can go back to doing what you're great at.

567
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,914

You just expect me to whip something off, is that it?

I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

581
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,085
Don't you worry about that.
你完全被隔离 这样你就可以专心写作

582
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:41,921

on account of it's missing an "N."

in my favorite writer's name.

So I thought maybe if you went back into town,
我想,也许 你如果可以回镇上去

you could bring me some white long-grained mimeo.
你会买一些白色的长纤维纸

598
00:44:33,475 --> 00:44:37,177

01:00:38,438 --> 01:00:40,806
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong.
抱歉保罗,这根本不对

700
01:00:40,874 --> 01:00:43,709
What? You'll have to do it over again.
- 什么?     - 你必须重写

701
01:00:43,776 --> 01:00:46,345
It's not worthy of you. Throw it all out.
这对你没有价值,扔掉吧

702
01:00:46,347 --> 01:00:48,313
Except for that part of naming the gravedigger after me.
除了跟我同姓氏的挖墓者 那一部分,你可以保留

703
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:50,265
You can leave that in.

704
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:54,737
I really value your criticism,
我很看重你的批评 但是也许我们都匆忙一点了

705
01:00:54,805 --> 01:00:56,856
but maybe we're being a little bit hasty here.

706
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:59,475
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
保罗,你写的不合情理

707
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:00,742
Not fair?
- 不合情理?     - 对

708
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:01,927
That's right.
我小时候在加州故乡

709
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,596
When I was growing up in Bakersfield,

710
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:05,330
my favorite thing in all the world
我最喜欢的事情 是周六下午去电影院看连续剧

711
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:08,000
was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays.

712
01:01:08,067 --> 01:01:09,251
Cliffhangers.
- 〈绝岭雄风〉 - 那我知道,了不起先生

713
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:11,320
I know that, Mr. Man!

714
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:14,590
They also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know!
他们也叫系列剧,我不傻 你该知道

715
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,228
<i>Anyway, my favorite was  Rocket Man.</i>
我最爱看的还是〈火箭人〉 有一次放映没有刹车的那一集

716
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:22,130
And once it was a no-brakes chapter,

717
01:01:22,198 --> 01:01:24,467
and the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road,
坏人把他困在山路上的车里

718
01:01:24,534 --> 01:01:26,335
and knocked him out and welded the doors shut,
打晕了他,把门关上,焊死 破坏了刹车要弄死他

719
01:01:26,402 --> 01:01:28,420
and tore out the brakes and started him to his death.

720
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:31,274
And he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out.
他醒来后 想控制方向,再逃出去

721
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:33,575
But the car went off a cliff before he could escape
但在他逃出之前 车子跌下悬崖,起火燃烧

722
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:36,679
and it crashed and burned, and I was so upset and excited!

723
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:38,158
对此我是如此紧张而兴奋!

724
01:01:36,746 --> 01:01:39,214
And the next week, you better believe, I was first in line.
下个星期我又第一个去看 刚开始还是重放上周的结尾

725
01:01:39,282 --> 01:01:41,567
And they always start with the end of the last week.

726
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:44,103
And there was Rocket Man, trying to get out,
还是火箭人想逃脱那一段 车子冲向悬崖

727
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:45,704
and here comes the cliff.
就在汽车跌下悬崖时,他逃了出来 孩子们马上齐声欢呼

728
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:48,957
And just before the car went off the cliff, he jumped free!

729
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:51,243
And all the kids cheered!

730
01:01:51,311 --> 01:01:52,845
But I didn't cheer.
但我没有 我立刻站起来大叫

731
01:01:52,913 --> 01:01:55,147
I stood right up and started shouting,

732
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:57,149
"This isn't what happened last week!
「上次不是这样,你们都忘了吗? 」

733
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,118
"Have you all got amnesia?

734
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:02,054
"They just cheated us! This isn't fair!
「他们欺骗我们,这不公平!」

735
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:05,925
"He didn't get out of the cock-a-doodie car!"
「他没有从那狗日的车里逃出来!」

736
01:02:13,116 --> 01:02:14,717
They always cheated like that in...
他们在连续剧里经常这样做

737
01:02:14,785 --> 01:02:16,352
Chapter plays.
但你不行 我的米瑟丽不能这样

738
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:17,987
But not you.

739
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:20,639
Not with my Misery.

740
01:02:20,706 --> 01:02:23,359
Remember Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book,
记得伊恩骑马去找克利医生吗 在书的结尾,马跨越栅栏跌倒了

741
01:02:23,426 --> 01:02:25,094
but his horse fell jumping that fence.

742
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:26,428
And Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs
伊恩摔断了肩膀和肋骨 整夜躺在沟里,没有找到医生

743
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:27,730
and lay all night in the ditch,

744
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:29,381
and he never reached the doctor.
因此不可能试着输血,救她一命

745
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:31,584
So there couldn't have been any experimental blood transfusion

746
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:33,486
that saved her life.

747
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:35,937
Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul,
到最后米瑟丽被埋在地下,保罗

748
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,240
so you'll have to start there.
所以你必须从那儿开始

749
01:03:18,531 --> 01:03:20,165
Is it fair?
这合情理吗? 我该接着这样写吗?

750
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,351
Should I continue?

751
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:23,819
You better.
你这样最好啦!

752
01:03:24,488 --> 01:03:26,371
Oh, Paul!
噢保罗!当伊恩意识到

753
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:29,158
When Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive
他们之所以活埋了米瑟丽 是因为蜂螫她已经昏迷

754
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:32,227
was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma.

755
01:03:32,295 --> 01:03:35,231
And when gravedigger Wilkes remembered how 30 years earlier
当挖墓工人威尔斯 回想起30年前

756
01:03:35,298 --> 01:03:37,900
the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!
同样的事情发生在 伊夫琳夫人身上

757
01:03:37,968 --> 01:03:40,002
And then old Dr. Cleary deduced
老克利医生推断,米瑟丽 一定是夫人失散多年的女儿

758
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,605
that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter

759
01:03:42,672 --> 01:03:44,406
because of the rarity of deadly bee stings.
这罕见的致命蜂螫 让我的心狂跳起来了

760
01:03:44,474 --> 01:03:46,908
My heart just leapt!

761
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,243
I've known from the very first book
从第一本书,我就知道米瑟丽 必定出身贵族,我没有错

762
01:03:48,311 --> 01:03:49,945
that Misery had to be born of nobility,

763
01:03:50,013 --> 01:03:51,063
and I was right!
是的

764
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,581
Yeah.
保罗,你写完后我可以接着看吗? 我可以补上N字母

765
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:54,617
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish?

766
01:03:54,684 --> 01:03:57,602
I can fill in the "N's."

767
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:00,072
Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out,
伊恩把她挖出来,她是跟从前一样 还是她会失去记忆?

768
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,773
or will she have amnesia?

769
01:04:01,775 --> 01:04:03,041
Have to wait.
那得等待

770
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:06,111
Will she still love him with that special, perfect love?

771
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:07,762
You'll have to wait.

772
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,114
Not even a hint?
甚至没有一点点提示?

<i>? But I'll be seeing you </i>
