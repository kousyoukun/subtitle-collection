3
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,870
Still got it.

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,670
[SHOTGUN PLAYING ON RADIO]
[广播中传来枪声]

5
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,690
[SINGING] I said, Shotgun

6
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,730
Shoot 'em for he runs now

7
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,740
Do the jerk, baby

8
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,160
Do the jerk now

9
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Hey

10
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,950
Put on your red dress

11
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,000
And then you go downtown now

12
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
I said buy yourself a shotgun now

13
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,010
We're gonna break it down baby now

14
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,010
We're gonna load it up baby now

15
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,970
And then you shoot him 'fore he runs now

16
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,600
I said, Shotgun

17
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,650
Shoot 'em 'fore he runs now

18
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,650
Do the jerk baby

19
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,820
Do the jerk now

20
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,740
Hey

21
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,790
Put on your high-heeled shoes

22
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,790
I said we're goin' down here Listen to 'em play the blues

23
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,880
We're gonna dig potatoes

24
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,670
We're gonna pick tomatoes

25
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,390
I said, Shotgun

26
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,310
Shoot 'em 'fore he runs now

27
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,230
Do the jerk baby

28
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,400
Do the jerk now

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Hey

30
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,150
I said it's Twine Time

32
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,860
那是什么?
What's that?

33
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,700
一个老朋友
An old friend.

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,540
我在翻衣柜时发现它静静的躺在那儿
I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there.

35
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,460
它看上去不错　保罗　很有性格
It's nice, Paul. It's got character.

36
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,130
当我完成自己的第一部作品时　我就是夹着它四处寻找出版商
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher.

37
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,420
那时我是个作家
I was a writer then.

38
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,800
你现在还是
You're still a writer.

39
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,380
但自从我写了米瑟瑞系列后就不是了
Haven't been a writer since I got in the Misery business.

40
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,010
那是个很不错的系列　它还会继续推出续集的
It's not a bad business. And it would still be growing, too.

41
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,970
这是初版的<i>米瑟瑞的孩子</i>
The first printing for Misery's Child

42
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,810
是最成功的　发行量超过100万册
was the most ever. Over a million.

43
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,980
马修，别再说下去了
Marcia, please.

44
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,480
米瑟瑞 查斯顿让你负担得起女儿看牙医的费用
Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth

45
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,980
还让她读完了大学
and is putting her through college,

46
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,400
让你买了两套房屋　并且让你每次听Knick的音乐会都能坐在楼上包厢里
bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knicks.

47
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,350
而你用什么再感谢她呢？你抛弃并杀害了她！
And what thanks does she get? You go and kill her!

48
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,530
我从没打算靠它生活
I never meant for it to become my life.

49
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,660
此外要是我现在不摆脱她
And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now,

50
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,950
我就会把她的故事继续没完没了的写下去
I'd have ended up writing her forever.

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,210
现在我得去科罗拉多州设法完成新书的写作了
Now I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish the new book.

52
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,500
如果我能完成这部作品，我想自己墓碑上的碑文内容也就有了
If I can make this work, I might just have something I want on my tombstone.

54
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,920
我是你的头号书迷
I'm your number-one fan.

55
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,760
没什么可担心的
There's nothing to worry about.

56
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,360
你会没事的　我会好好照顾你的
You're gonna be just fine. I'll take good care of you.

57
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,600
我是你的头号书迷
I'm your number-one fan.

58
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,740
这是什么地方?
Where...

59
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,530
我们在银溪郡附近
We're just outside Silver Creek.

60
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,540
我待了多久了？
How long?

61
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,610
你睡了两天了　你会好起来的
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.

62
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,920
我叫安妮 威尔克斯
My name is Annie Wilkes.

63
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,590
我的头号书迷
My number-one fan.

64
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,500
是的　没错　我还是一名护士
Yes. That's right. I'm also a nurse.

65
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,830
来，把这些吃下去
Here, take these.

66
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,750
来吧
Here.

67
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,380
- 这是什么？　　- 这是Novril
- What are they?　　 - They're called Novril.

68
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,180
止疼用的
They're for your pain.

69
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,690
谢谢你
Thank you.

70
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,450
为什么我不是在医院里?
How come I'm not in a hospital?

71
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,040
暴风雪太厉害　我不能冒险把你送到那儿
The blizzard was too strong.I couldn't risk trying to get you there.

72
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,290
我打电话试过，但是电话线都断了
I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.

74
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,080
你不要再乱动了　你需要休息
You mustn't tire yourself. You've gotta rest.

75
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,460
你差点就没命了
You almost died.

76
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,770
张开嘴
Open wide.

77
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,570
你只要稍微动一下腿你就会叫得像是在唱歌剧一样，不是吗？
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?

78
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,140
你的伤会好起来的，保罗，我向你保证
It's not gonna hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.

79
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,780
我还可以走路吗?
Will I be able to walk?

80
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,950
当然可以
Of course you will.

81
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,580
你的手臂也会没事的
And your arm will be fine, too.

82
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,920
之前你的肩膀严重脱臼
Your shoulder was pretty badly dislocated.

83
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,210
虽然有些不好处理，不过我最后还是“啪”的一下将它推回去了
It was a little stubborn, but I finally popped it back in.

84
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,130
让我最为感到骄傲的是治疗你的腿伤
What I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs.

85
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,710
考虑到我家里条件有限
Considering what I had around the house,

86
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,800
不过我并不认为能有医生可以比我做得更好
I don't think there's a doctor who could've done any better.

87
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,140
其实没有看上去那么糟
It's not nearly as bad as it looks.

88
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,520
你双腿胫骨粉碎性骨折
You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs,

89
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,440
右腿腓骨也有骨折
and the fibula in the right leg is fractured, too.

90
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,770
我可以听到骨头在里边移动 
I could hear the bones moving,

91
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,400
所以你的腿最好别动
so it's best for your legs to remain immobile.

92
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,280
只要道路交通恢复
And as soon as the roads open

93
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,450
我就把你送到医院去
I'll take you to a hospital.

94
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,580
目前，你需要长时间的静养
Meantime, you've got a lot of recovering to do,

95
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,290
我认为能在我家休养对我来说真是莫大的荣幸
and I consider it an honor that you'll do it in my home.

96
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,970
我是纽约市的马修 辛德尔
This is Marcia Sindell, I'm calling from New York City.

97
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,090
我想同银溪郡的警察局长或是警长通话
I'd like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police or Sheriff.

98
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,340
你想他们中的哪一位通话呢? 
Which one of them do you want?

99
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,800
谁有空就同谁吧
Whichever one's not busy.

100
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,810
好的，我非常确定他们两人现在都有空，辛德尔女士
Well, I'm pretty sure they're both not busy, Miss Sindell

101
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,730
因为这两个职位都由我一人兼任
since they're both me.

102
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,400
同时我还是警察福利协会的会长
I also happen to be president of the Policeman's Benefit Association,

103
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,650
巡警退休基金会的主席
chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund,

104
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,860
要是你需要一位好的钓鱼指导，那情况会更糟
and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse.

105
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,320
就叫我老兄吧　这里人人都这样叫我
Call me Buster. Everybody does.

106
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,120
有什么要帮忙的吗?
What can I do for you?

107
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,910
我是个出版经纪人，嗯我... 给你打电话让我感觉自己像在做件傻事
I'm a literary agent, and I... I feel like a fool calling you,

108
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,670
我认为我的一位客户　保罗 谢尔顿
but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon,

109
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,460
也许遭遇到什么不测了
might be in some kind of trouble.

110
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,300
你是说保罗 谢尔顿，那位作家?
You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?

111
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,420
他是你的客户，嗯? 
He's your client, huh?

112
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,720
是的，没错
Yes, he is.

113
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,680
所有人都很喜欢他写的米瑟瑞小说
Everybody sure likes those Misery books.

114
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,010
我相信你知道保罗多年来都会到银溪旅馆
I'm sure you know that Paul's been coming to the Silver Creek Lodge

115
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,930
去完成作品的写作
for years to finish his books.

116
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,850
我知道他过去六个星期都在这里
I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.

117
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,860
嗯，别挂电话　我刚才给旅馆打过电话
Well, not quite. I just called there

118
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,400
他们说踏上周二就已经退房了
and they said he checked out last Tuesday.

119
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,860
这不是有些不对劲吗？
Isn't that a little strange?

120
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,910
我不知道　他通常都会给你电话的吗？
I don't know. Does he usually phone you

121
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,950
在他退房之前？
before he checks out of a hotel?

122
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,200
不，当然不会　只是他女儿一直都没有接到他的电话
No, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him,

123
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,330
每次他有新书著成的时候，他通常都会同她联系的
and when he has a new book coming out, he usually keeps in touch.

124
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,040
而现在他一点儿消息都没有，我…
Now when there wasn't any word from him, I...

125
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,170
你认为他很可能失踪了，嗯？
You think he might be missin', huh?

127
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,340
我本不想打这个电话的　告诉我我是不是有些多虑了
I hate that I made this call. Tell me I'm being silly.

128
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,970
也许是有点过分担心了， 不过让我告诉你接下来我将采取怎样的措施 
A little overprotective, maybe, but tell you what I'll do.

129
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,850
虽然目前还没收到任何报告
Nothing's been reported out here,

130
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,770
但我会将他的名字加入我们的系统中，此外
but I'll put his name through our system, and

131
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,230
如有其他任何发现，我会给你回电话的
if anything turns up, I'll call you right back.

132
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,690
您能那样做我很感激　非常感谢
I'd appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

133
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,950
再见，辛德尔女士
Goodbye, Miss Sindell.

134
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,740
有人给我们打电话啊? 真是个忙碌的早晨
We got a phone call? Busy morning.

135
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,160
没错　除了工作就是，工作，工作
Yeah. Work, work, work.

136
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,910
维吉尼亚，上次暴风雪是什么时候的事儿？
Virginia, when was that blizzard?

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,460
上周二　怎么了?
Last Tuesday. Why?

138
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,960
没甚么
No reason.

139
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,350
我在想，你在暴风雪中找到我简直就是某种奇迹
I guess it was kind of a miracle, you finding me.

141
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,100
不，这根本不是什么奇迹
No, it wasn't a miracle at all.

142
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,310
不如说，我一直都在跟着你
In a way, I was following you.

143
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
你跟着我?
You were following me?

144
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,940
是啊，你住在银溪郡里对我来说没有任何秘密可言
Well, it wasn't any secret to me you were staying at the Silver Creek,

145
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,820
这就是头号书迷的区别
seeing as how I'm your number-one fan and all.

146
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,530
有时我会在夜里前往旅馆那儿，坐在外边
Some nights I'd just tool on down there and sit outside

147
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,120
抬头看着从你那间客房透出的灯光
and look up at the light in your cabin

148
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,670
于是我就试着想象这位世界上最伟大的作家正在那间屋子里做什么呢
and I'd try to imagine what was goin' on in the room of the world's greatest writer.

149
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,750
把最后那段话再说一遍好吗，我没听清楚
Say the last part again, I didn't hear you.

150
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,300
别动
Don't move now.

151
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,960
我可不想伤到你的脖子
I wouldn't want to hurt this neck.

152
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,390
是这样，那天下午我正好在回家的路上
Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home

153
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,470
看见你走出旅馆
and there you were, leavin' the lodge.

154
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,350
于是我就在想这位文学天才干嘛要在
And I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive

155
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,310
暴风雪即将来临的时候开车外出？
when there was a big storm comin'.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,940
我不知道会有暴风雪
I didn't know there was a big storm coming.

157
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,820
噢，那你真是幸运　同样的，我也很幸运
Well, lucky for you, I did. And lucky for me, too,

158
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,530
因为你还活着，这样就可以继续写出更多的书了
'cause now you're alive and you can write more books.

159
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,030
噢，保罗，我看过你的所有作品
Oh, Paul, I've read everything of yours.

160
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,830
米瑟瑞系列小说　我简直烂熟于心
The Misery novels. I know 'em all by heart.

161
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,370
一共8本　我都非常喜欢
All eight of 'em. I love them so.

162
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,000
噢，你真是太善良了
Well, you're very kind.

163
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,830
而且才华横溢
And you're very brilliant.

164
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,550
像个婴儿一样乖乖的　好了
Like a baby. All done.

165
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,670
谢谢
Thank you.

166
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,260
你认为电话线何时可以修复？我得同我的女儿通个电话
When do you think the phone lines'll be up? I have to call my daughter,

167
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,930
还有我想给我在纽约的经纪人打个电话
and I'd like to call my agent in New York

168
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,810
让她知道我还活着
and let her know I'm still breathing.

169
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,730
应该不用等太久了
It shouldn't be too much longer now.

170
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,020
一旦交通恢复，电话线很快就能修好
Once the roads are open, the phone lines'll be up in no time.

171
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,360
要是你把他们的电话号码给我，我会试着替你联系他们的
If you give me their numbers, I'll keep tryin' them for you.

172
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
谢谢
Thank you.

173
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,650
我可以向你提一个请求吗?
Could I ask you a favor?

174
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,790
我注意到在你的皮夹里有一部新的保罗 谢尔顿作品，因此
I noticed in your case there's a new Paul Sheldon book, and

175
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,870
我想否可以…
I wondered if maybe...

176
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,620
你想看它? 
You want to read it?

177
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,500
嗯，如果您不介意的话
Well, if you wouldn't mind.

178
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,750
嗯，对于谁能在未出版前阅读我的手稿
Well, I do have a very hard-and-fast rule as to

179
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,960
我有非常严格的规定 
who reads my stuff at this early stage.

180
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,220
只有我的编辑，我的经纪人
Only my editor, my agent,

181
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,260
以及在暴风雪中救我让我免于冻死在倾覆的车里的人才可以看
and anybody that saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.

183
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,980
您永远想也象不到您给我的是怎样一种特殊的待遇
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.

185
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,400
我的大男孩儿，你的疼痛就像时钟一样分秒不差
Boy, it's like clockwork the way your pain comes.

186
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,950
我给你拿Novril来，保罗
I'll get you your Novril, Paul.

187
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,410
请原谅我不停在说些废话让您感觉很无聊
Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy.

188
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,830
您这本新书叫什么名字？
What's your new book called?

189
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,130
我现在还没有想好
I don't have a title yet.

190
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,250
是写什么的?
What's it about?

191
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,760
我不知道
I don't know.

192
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,930
我知道这听起来有些不可思议，不过到目前为止我除了写米瑟瑞
I know it sounds crazy, but I haven't written anything

193
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,050
没写过关于别的书
but Misery for so long.

194
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,430
你为什么不看看，然后告诉我
Why don't you read it, and you can tell me

195
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,810
你认为它是写什么的？
what you think it's about?

196
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,980
说不定你能想出一个书名来
Maybe you can come up with a title.

197
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,700
听上去我好像能够办到！
Like I could do that!

198
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,900
银溪旅馆

199
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,400
谢尔顿先生离开时跟往常没有什么不同，老兄
There's nothin' unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster.

200
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,280
可从他点的香槟就能看出来 
You can tell by the champagne. 

201
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,620
也许你能，利比
Maybe you can, Libby.

202
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,490
不，要知道，在他准备离开前
No, see, he always orders a bottle of Dom Pérignon

203
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,910
他总会点上一瓶Dom Périgno香槟
when he's ready to go.

204
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,120
结账之后便走出大门
Then he pays up and he's out the door.

205
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,500
没有长途电话打来或是收到联邦快递包裹吗？
No long-distance phone calls or Federal Express packages?

206
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,790
有什么异常表现吗?
Anything out of the ordinary?

207
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,800
我不认为谢尔顿先生身上
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes

208
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,340
有表现出什么异常的
for things to be out of the ordinary.

209
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,130
想想他是什么人吧，那么有名
Considering who he is and all, famous and all,

210
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,970
可从没有架子
he doesn't put on airs.

211
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,310
每次都开着同一辆65年款的野马汽车从纽约来
Drives up from New York in the same car each time, a '65 Mustang.

212
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
他说这有助于他进行思考
He says it helps him to think.

213
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,270
他还是个很好的住客
He's always been a good guest.

214
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,030
住在这里也非常的安静，连鬼魂都不会被打扰到
Never makes a noise, never bothers a soul.

215
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,700
我当然希望他不要发生什么事情
I sure hope nothing's happened to him.

216
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,990
我也是
So do I.

217
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,200
我打赌那辆旧野马车现在已经开进纽约了
I bet that old Mustang is pulling into New York right now.

218
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,580
我相信你说得没错　谢谢，利比
I'm sure you're right. Thanks, Libby.

219
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,530
不用客气
My pleasure.

220
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,640
我知道你的这本书自己只看了40页，不过...
I know I'm only 40 pages into your book, but...

221
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
不过什么?
But what?

222
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,070
没什么
Nothing.

223
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,400
它怎么样？
What is it?

224
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,280
噢，简直太荒谬了
Well, it's ridiculous.

225
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,910
我怎么有资格对您这样的人发表评论？
Who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?

226
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,320
没关系，我可以接受
It's all right, I can take it.

227
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
嗯，写得很精彩
Well, it's brilliantly written.

228
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,670
当然只要是您写的都非常精彩
But then everything you write is brilliant.

229
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,710
很粗俗吧?
Pretty rough so far?

230
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,380
里边那些咒骂的话，保罗
The swearing, Paul.

231
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,300
是的，我说过的 
There, I said it.

232
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,930
那些…那些粗俗的字眼让你觉得很不舒服吗？
The... The profanity bothers you?

233
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,430
一点都不高贵
It has no nobility.

234
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,940
那些是贫民区的孩子们说的　我过去也生活在贫民区
These are slum kids.I was a slum kid.

235
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,440
那里每个人说话都是那样
Everybody talks like that.

236
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,690
他们才不是这样！（大妈把米瑟瑞代入自己身上了！）
They do not!

237
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,070
你认为当我到镇上的饲料店我会怎么说？
What do you think I say when I go to the feed store in town?

238
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,700
"瓦利，给我来袋他妈的猪食"
"Now, Wally, give me a bag of that F-ing pig feed

239
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,490
"还有10磅婊子养的牛饲料？"?
"and 10 pounds of that bitchly cow corn"?

240
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,490
要是在银行，我会这样跟博林杰夫人说
And in the bank, do I tell Mrs. Bollinger,

241
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,330
“给你他妈的混蛋支票
"Here's one big bastard of a check,

242
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,410
把神圣个你妈的钞票给我？“
"give me some of your Christing money"?

243
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,510
就是这样！你看看就是这样！看看你都让我做了些什么？
There! Look there! See what you made me do?

244
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,300
保罗 ，我很抱歉
Paul, I'm sorry.

245
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,010
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

246
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,730
有时我真的很激动　您能原谅我吗？
Sometimes I get so worked up. Can you ever forgive me?

247
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,230
没关系
It's fine.

248
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
我爱你，保罗
I love you, Paul.

249
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,780
我是指　你得思想　你的创造力
Your mind. Your creativity. That's all I meant.

250
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,660
嗯，这真的很刺激
Well, this sure is fun.

251
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,260
维吉尼亚，当你在这辆车上的时候
Virginia, when you're in this car

252
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,180
你不是我太太，而是我的副手
you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

253
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,720
噢，这位副手她宁愿呆在家里
Well, this deputy'd rather be home

254
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,560
同警长裹在一条被子里
under the covers with the sheriff.

255
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,440
- 停车　停车　　- 出什么状况了？出什么了？
- Stop. Stop　　- What? What?

256
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,370
看见这些折断的树枝没？
See that broken limb?

257
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,120
可能是被雪压断的
Could've been the weight of the snow.

258
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,540
是吗？可能是腐烂了，也可能是被风吹断了
Yeah? Could've been a rotten branch, could've been the wind,

259
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,920
还可能是别的很多事情
could've been a lot of things.

261
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,660
该死！
Damn!

262
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,710
需要帮忙吗？
Need some help?

263
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,520
不，我不过是自说自话！谢谢
No, I'm enjoyin' myself! Thank you.

264
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,440
你真的认为谢尔顿的车冲出了公路？
You really think Sheldon's out there?

265
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,040
我希望不是这样　如果是的话，他已经没命了
I hope not. If he is, he's dead.

266
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,030
我们去报社吧
Let's go to the newspaper office.

268
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,030
希望没吵醒你
I hope I didn't wake you.

269
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,860
没有，没关系
No, that's fine.

270
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,580
看看我都弄到了什么　商店里摆了你的书，保罗
Look what I got. They had it at the store, Paul.

271
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,160
商店里摆了好大一堆
There was a whole batch of 'em there

272
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,750
我一看见就马上掏出钱　我买到了第一本呃
and as soon as I saw it I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.

273
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,960
那么交通已经恢复了
Then the roads are open.

274
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,500
嗯，通向镇上的路通了，不过仅限于此
Well, the one to town is,but that's about it.

275
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,510
我给医院打过电话找首席外科医生谈过
I called the hospital and I talked to the head orthopedic surgeon

276
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,680
还告诉他您是谁以及事情的经过
and I told him who you were and what had happened.

277
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,430
他说只要没有感染你就不会有事
He said as long as there's no infection you're not in any danger,

278
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,600
一旦通向医院的道路恢复了
and as soon as the road to the hospital is open,

279
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,140
他们就会为你派辆救护车来
they'll send an ambulance for you.

280
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,440
电话能用了吗？
The phone's working?

281
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,190
噢，我的电话还没接通，不过镇上的已经恢复了
Well, mine's still out, but the ones in town were working just fine.

282
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,030
我已经跟你的经济人通过电话了
I called that agent of yours.

283
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,320
保罗，我刚看完书的前几页
Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.

284
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,450
第一页真是太棒了
What a wonderful first page.

285
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,870
一读到米瑟瑞 查斯顿这名字
Just to read the name Misery Chastain...

286
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,290
我女儿就会变得忘乎所以
My daughter's gotta be goin' nuts.

287
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,540
就像我最老，最亲密的朋友前来拜访一样
It's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.

288
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,880
我是说，我原本打算回家给她过生日的　今天是她生日
I mean, I'm supposed to be home for her birthday. It's today.

289
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,500
你的经纪人说她会告诉你女儿你没事
The agent said she would tell her you were okay,

290
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,260
不过我恐怕你只有等到明天了
but I'm afraid you'll have to wait till tomorrow

291
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,970
如果你打算亲自告诉她的话
if you want to talk to her yourself.

292
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,250
噢，保罗　你真是一位了不起的诗人
Oh, Paul. What a poet you are.

293
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,990
我给你做了我的拿手菜，威尔克斯炒蛋
I made you my specialty, scrambled eggs à la Wilkes.

294
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,320
现在我看到75页了
And I'm on Page 75.

295
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,740
我猜也就是说这本书还行吧
I guess that means it's okay.

296
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,160
不
No.

297
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,580
不，不是的，它…
No, it isn't, it's...

298
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,840
噢　我实在想不出用什么词来说好（其实我也想这么说）
Pooh. I can't think of any words.

299
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,340
说它”非常好“会是对你的侮辱吗？
Would "great" be insulting?

300
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,880
非常好我就已经很满意了
I can live with great.

301
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,220
不　它不只是非常好，它
No. It's not just great, it's

302
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,510
简直太完美了
perfect.

303
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,940
一部完美的，完美的作品
A perfect, perfect thing.

305
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,900
我想是时候让你们俩认识一下了
I thought it was time you two should meet.

306
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,110
保罗，跟我在这个世界上最喜爱的动物打个招呼吧
Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in the whole world,

307
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,870
这是我的米瑟瑞，它是头母猪
my sow Misery.

308
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,660
米瑟瑞?
Misery?

309
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,410
对　我跟你说过我是你的头号书迷
Yes. I told you I was your number-one fan.

310
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,210
对，我...我开始有些相信你了
Yeah, I'm... I'm starting to believe you.

311
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,540
这个农场从前很沉闷的
This farm was kind of dreary

312
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,840
只有几头母牛和鸡同我生活在一起
what with just a few cows and chickens and me.

313
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,380
但是自从有了米瑟瑞，一切都改变了（丰胸广告句式）
But when I got Misery here, everything changed.

314
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,300
她让我有了欢笑
She just makes me smile so.

315
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,370
她真的是一头很好的猪
She's a fine pig, is what she is.

316
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,620
我现在看到300页了，保罗，它简直用完美都不足以形容　是神圣
I'm on Page 300 now, Paul, and it's better than perfect. It's divine.

317
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,030
那个外国人在天花板上画的是什么？
What's the ceiling that dago painted?

318
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,780
是希斯廷教堂吗？
The Sistine Chapel?

319
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,870
对了！西斯廷教堂还有米瑟瑞的孩子
Yeah! That and Misery's Child.

320
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,540
是这个世界上仅有的两件神圣的事物！
Those are the only two divine things ever in this world!

322
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,770
当我丈夫离开我时，我丝毫没有准备
When my husband left me, I wasn't prepared.

323
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,310
那段日子很难熬
It wasn't an easy time.

324
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,020
有段时间我都感觉自己快要疯了
For a while I thought I might go crazy.

325
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,570
我知道那是怎样的一种感觉
I know how that can be.

326
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,660
我不知道你是怎样，不过我就是这样熬过去的
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it

327
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,370
我全身心的投入工作
was I dove into work.

328
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,680
日以继夜
Days, nights.

329
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,540
在医院值夜班是孤独的
Night shifts can be lonely at a hospital.

330
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,830
于是我看了许多书
I did a lot of reading.

331
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,590
我就是在那时发现了米瑟瑞
That was when I first discovered Misery.

332
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,350
她让我感到开心　让我忘了我所有的烦恼
She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.

333
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,600
当然，我认为这其中也有些许是因为你的原因
Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that, too.

334
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,690
是的，嗯…
Yeah, well...

335
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,940
我一页一页的不停的阅读着它们
I just kept reading them over and over.

336
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,900
当我只看了两章之后
I've only got two chapters to go on this one,

337
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,570
我就知道等我看完这遍之后我还会再一次从头看起
and I know when I finish I'll just turn right to the first page

338
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,370
然后再从头看一遍
and start reading it all over again.

339
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,790
我...
I'm...

340
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,080
- 尿完了?　　- 是的
- Done?　　- Yeah.

341
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,540
没问题
No problem.

342
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,300
谢谢
Thanks.

343
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,800
别误会了　我并不反对同鳏夫结婚（男主角丧偶）
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage perse,

344
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,340
不过那必须得是个非常特别的人才能让我
but it'd take a pretty special guy to make me

345
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,890
愿意再次走在教堂的红地毯上
want to walk down that aisle again.

346
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,470
没错，这件事比不得其他，你不该轻率决定
Yeah, it's not something you should enter into lightly.

347
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,980
总的来说就是需要尊重
It boils down to respect.

348
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,310
如今人们已经不再尊重婚姻
People just don't respect the institution of marriage anymore.

349
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,070
他们对什么叫做一辈子的承诺毫无概念
They have no sense of real commitment.

350
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,200
嗯，我很想坐在这里跟你好好聊聊
Well, I'd love to stay here and chat,

351
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,080
不过我很快就要看完了，我很想知道是怎样的结局
but I'm right at the end, and I gotta find out what happens.

355
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,710
你...
You...

356
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,190
你这卑鄙的家伙　你怎么可以这样做?
You dirty bird. How could you?

357
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,400
她不能死！米瑟瑞 查斯顿不能死！
She can't be dead! Misery Chastain cannot be dead!

358
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,160
安妮，在1871年，妇女通常在生产时死亡
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth.

359
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,620
但她的精神才是最重要的
But her spirit is the important thing,

360
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,620
米瑟瑞的精神仍旧活着
and Misery's spirit is still alive.

361
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,380
我不要她的精神！我要她活着！
I don't want her spirit! I want her!

362
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,590
而你却杀了她！
And you murdered her!

363
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,250
不　我没有
No. I didn't.

364
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,920
那是谁呢?
Who did?

365
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:46,180
没有谁　她死了，她就这样不经意间远离了
No one. She died, she just slipped away.

366
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,260
不经意间远离了？不经意间远离了？
Slipped away? Slipped away?

367
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,100
她不会就这样离开的！是你杀了她！
She didn't just slip away! You did it!

368
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,400
是你！是你！
You did it! You did it!

369
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,570
是你杀了她！是你杀了她！你杀了我的米瑟瑞！
You did it! You did it! You murdered my Misery!

370
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,650
安妮!
Annie!

371
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,330
我原本以为你是个好人，保罗
I thought you were good, Paul.

372
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,000
但你不是　你只不过是另一个撒谎的卑鄙的老家伙
But you're not good. You're just another lying old dirty birdie.

373
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,090
我想我还是离开你一会儿比较好
And I don't think I better be around you for a while.

374
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,850
别指望会有任何人来找你
And don't even think about anybody coming for you.

375
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,890
医生，你的经纪人，还有你的家人，谁都不会来
Not the doctors, not your agent, not your family,

376
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,440
因为我根本就没有通知他们
because I never called them.

377
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,770
没人知道你在这儿
Nobody knows you're here.

378
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,780
你最好希望我别出什么事
And you better hope nothing happens to me.

379
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,610
因为我要是死了，你一个人也活不成
Because if I die, you die.

386
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,390
不，辛德尔女士，你就算现在赶来也没有意义
No, Miss Sindell, there's no point in comin' up here now.

387
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,890
我们已经尽力了
Everything that can be done is.

388
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,610
是的，我们同州警察密切协作
Yes, we're working close with the state police

389
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,980
并且也将此事通知了联邦调查局
and the FBI's been informed.

390
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,820
好的　好的　一旦我们有什么消息就会立刻通知你的
Right. Right. As soon as we know anything, we'll let you know.

391
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,530
一点也不麻烦　随时都可以来电话　再见，辛德尔女士
No bother at all. Call anytime. Bye, Miss Sindell.

392
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,330
好的　那么，非常感激你所做的一切　谢谢
All right. Well, I sure appreciate it. Thank you.

393
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,090
根据对谢尔顿的信用卡支付记录调查显示
According to the check on Sheldon's credit charges,

394
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,380
在银溪郡之后，没有别的地方的使用记录
there's nothing after the Silver Creek.

395
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,800
同样，也没有接到关于手稿的电话
And no calls about the article, either.

396
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,430
你这可怜的，讨人喜欢的家伙　你躺在地板上干什么呢？
You poor, dear thing. What are you doing on the floor?

397
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,770
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

398
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,560
要是我有一张正规的医院病床这样的事永远也不会发生
If I'd had a proper hospital bed this never would've happened.

399
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,980
来吧，让我把你扶到床上去
Here, let me help you back in.

400
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,910
我知道这会有点疼，不过只要忍几秒钟就好了
I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds.

401
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,490
起！
Upsy-daisy!

403
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,290
拜托，慢点儿
Please, wait.

404
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,090
你这个宝宝还真是爱哭
You're such a crybaby.

405
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,140
行了　还舒服吧？
There you go. Comfy?

406
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,850
非常好
Perfect.

407
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,140
你真是孩子气
You're such a kidder.

408
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,480
我有一个大大的惊喜要给你
I have a big surprise for you.

409
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,020
但首先你必须做件事情
But first there's something you must do.

410
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,230
你不会介意在我等待这个惊喜的时候
You don't suppose I could have a little snack

411
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,280
给我来点儿点心吧？
while I'm waiting for the surprise?

412
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,910
你要什么我都会给你，不过你先得听我说完
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first.

413
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,490
有时候我的思维有点儿混乱，这我承认
Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that.

414
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
这也是为什么我想不起
That's why I couldn't remember

415
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,500
他们在丹佛向我出示证据时所提的那些问题是什么的原因
all the things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.

416
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,000
不过这次我的想得很清楚
But this time I thought clearly.

417
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,380
我问上帝该怎样看待你在我这里一事
I asked God about you,

418
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,170
上帝回答说：“我把他交给你”
and God said, "I delivered him unto you"

419
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,550
”这样你就能够为他指引道路了“
"so that you may show him the way."

420
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,880
为我指引道路?
Show me the way?

421
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,140
没错
Yes.

422
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,630
我说的是点心
When I mentioned a snack,

423
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,260
我考虑得更多的是电话线
I was thinking more along the lines

424
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,180
乳酪还有干酪、饼干诸如此类的东西
of cheese and crackers kind of thing.

425
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,640
保罗，现在不是开玩笑的时候
Paul, this is no time for jokes.

426
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,350
你必须让这件污秽之物从这个世上消失
You must rid the world of this filth.

427
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,980
你要我烧掉自己的书？
You want me to burn my book?

428
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,020
我知道要你这样做很难，但这是最好的办法
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.

429
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,150
其实也没这么困难
It's really not difficult at all.

430
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,740
我的经纪人做了许多副本
My agent made dozens of copies.

431
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,070
在纽约还会有场手稿拍卖会
There's gonna be an auction in New York.

432
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,700
现在纽约的每家出版社都在看这本书
Every publishing house in New York is reading it now.

433
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,080
因此如果你希望我烧了我的书，那好吧
So if you want me to burn my book, fine.

434
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,040
你并没有让任何东西从这个世界上消失
You're not really ridding the world of anything.

435
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,670
那就划火柴把，保罗
Then light the match, Paul.

436
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,300
这没什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

437
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,670
既然你已经说没什么了　那就动手吧
So you've indicated. Do it.

438
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,270
我知道这是唯一的一本，保罗
I know this is the only copy, Paul.

439
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,730
在你24岁写出自己第一本书的时候，你就没有留下副本
When you were 24 you wrote your first book, and you didn't make a copy

440
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,190
因为你根本没想到会有人重视它
because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously.

441
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,530
但是他们很重视　于是自此以后你从来都不留副本
But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies

442
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,990
因为你迷信
because you're superstitious.

443
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,320
这也是为什么你总是回到那家银溪旅馆
It's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge.

444
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,580
这是一年前你对梅尔夫 格里芬说的
You told that story to Merv Griffin1 years ago.

445
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,830
梅尔夫 格里芬（FUCK）
Merv Griffin.

446
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,920
我告诉你吧　这本书不会出版
I'll tell you what. It doesn't ever have to be published.

447
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,090
没人有机会可以看到
No one ever has to read it.

448
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,170
我只是为自己留着的
I'll just keep it for myself.

449
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,430
没人会知道它的存在
No one will even know it exists.

450
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,430
这本书一天不毁掉，你的思想就永远也得不到解放
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free.

451
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,400
我觉得你应该把火柴点着，保罗
I think you should light the match, Paul.

452
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,870
你就看不出这是上帝的旨意吗？
Can't you see it's what God wants?

453
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,030
你这样的聪明 
You're so brilliant,

454
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,000
我想你毫无疑问会明白的
I would think you'd certainly be able to see that.

455
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,170
我们到这个世上是来帮助别人的，保罗
We're put on this earth to help people, Paul.

456
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,000
正如现在我想帮助你一样
Like I'm trying to help you.

457
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,970
拜托　让我帮助你吧
Please. Help me help you.

458
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,490
你正在做的是一件正确的事情
You're doing the right thing.

459
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,330
我的天哪！仁慈的上帝啊！噢，我的天
My goodness! Goodness gracious! Oh, my.

460
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,380
无题 保罗 谢尔顿著

461
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,260
天呀！上帝啊！
Goodness! Heavens to Betsy!

462
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,090
噢，我的天哪！噢，我的天哪！
Oh, my goodness!　Oh, my goodness!

463
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,180
上帝啊！噢，我的天！
Heavens to Betsy! Oh, goodness!

464
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,580
好了，烧得还算彻底吧？
Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

466
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,190
下边是斯蒂曼家
That's the Steadman place down there.

467
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,520
往前面是威尔克斯农场
And that's the Wilkes farm straight ahead.

468
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,030
没有65年的野马车
That's no '65 Mustang.

469
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,910
这里没甚么了，我们... 我们回去吧
There's nothing else out this way. Let's... Let's circle back.

470
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,840
我相信冬季会
I do believe the winters are getting

471
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,300
一年比一年短
shorter and shorter every year.

472
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,220
人们说这跟臭氧层有关
People say it has something to do with the ozone layer.

473
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,350
你认为呢?
What do you think?

474
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,730
我不知道
I don't know.

475
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,440
是的，当然，这只是个理论
Yeah, well, it's a theory.

476
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,780
这是你今天的Novril
Here's your Novril.

477
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,490
好了　我们又回到了现场
All right. We're back.

478
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,160
现在，你们将告诉我们现场观众们选择了谁
Now, you're gonna have to remind us who the audience chose.

479
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,620
他们选了凯文　他们选了凯文
They chose Kevin. They chose Kevin.

480
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
- 嗨，凯文　　- 嗨，你好吗，查克?
- Hi, Kevin　　- Hi. How you doin', Chuck?

481
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,500
好的　就当在自己家一样，别紧张
Fine. Make yourself at home back there

482
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,250
接下来谢瑞会告诉我们关于本次约会的事
and Sheree will tell us about the date.

483
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,170
OK　首先，我挑选了一家非常漂亮的餐厅
Okay. First of all, I picked out a very classy restaurant.

484
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,550
那里太漂亮了，而他竟然没有打领带就出现了…
It was so classy, and he shows up without no tie...

486
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,400
看见没，是不是很好看?
See, isn't this nice?

487
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,990
非常好　我一直想到房间的另一头去转转
Great. I always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

488
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,660
看看我都给你买了什么
And look what I got for you.

489
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,620
一支电动刮胡刀，这样今后你就能自己刮胡子了
An electric razor, so you can shave yourself now.

491
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,010
如果我早知道惊喜就是指的这个，我宁愿烧掉我所有的书（崩溃）
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, I'd have burned all my books.

492
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,550
别耍嘴皮子了！
Now, don't poke fun!

493
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,800
今天对你来说可是相当重要的日子，保罗
This is a very big day for you, Paul.

494
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,890
你只要好好的坐着就行，我会把一切都安排好的
You just sit tight and I'll set everything up.

495
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,430
安排什么?
Set what up?

496
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,140
那是个大惊喜
That's the big surprise.

497
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,770
你的新工作室
Your new studio.

498
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,190
毕竟，作家需要有地方来工作
After all, writers do need a place to work.

499
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,780
工作？你是指写作？
Work? You mean write?

500
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,870
你凭什么认为我得写作呢？
What in the world do you think I'd write?

501
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,580
保罗，我不认为我知道
Paul, I don't think. I know.

502
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,620
现在你已经毁掉了那份龌龊的手稿
Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript,

503
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,710
你可以重新开始做你擅长的事
you can go back to doing what you're great at.

504
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,420
你即将写出一本新的小说
You're gonna write a new novel,

505
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,800
那将是你最为杰出的作品
your greatest achievement ever.

506
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,630
米瑟瑞归来
Misery's Return.

507
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,340
米瑟瑞归来?
Misery's Return?

508
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,510
我知道在你杀掉她的时候自己心里其实并不是这样想的
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her,

509
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,680
现在你可以纠正它
and now you'll make it right.

510
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,560
这将是一本为答谢我
It'll be a book in my honor,

511
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,310
救命之恩的感恩之作
for saving your life and nursing you back to health.

512
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,440
保罗，你将令我成为全世界羡慕的对象！
Paul, you're gonna make me the envy of the whole world!

513
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,990
你是希望让我匆忙间写点什么，对吧？
You just expect me to whip something off, is that it?

514
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,160
我期望是一部任何方面都不输给你以往杰作的作品
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

515
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,500
你应该知道书可不是这样写出来的
You do understand that this is not the ordinary way in which books get written.

516
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,250
我的意思是，人们会认为这真的是一个很古怪的写作环境
I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.

517
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,920
我对你的才华完全有信心
I have total confidence in your brilliance.

518
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,300
此外，这里的美丽风景也会激发你的灵感
Besides, the view will inspire you.

519
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,800
你就好好的大吃一顿吧　我很快就回来
You just inhale that. I'll be right back.

520
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,280
我猜你的邻居不是经常来麻烦你
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.

521
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,070
那个你一点都不用担心
Don't you worry about that

522
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,740
你现在已经完全与世隔绝，这样你就能专注于写作上
you'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.

523
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,030
非常好（无奈）
Great.

524
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,660
我给你买来了这种高价的打字纸
I got you this expensive paper to type on

525
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,000
而这个打字机买得很划算，只花了50镑
and I got a great deal on this 50-pound clunker

526
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,420
因为它的字母“N”给掉了
on account of its missing an "N."

527
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,630
我对女售货员说，“N”是我最喜欢的作家名字中的字母
I told the saleslady "N" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.

528
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:04,550
而我最喜欢的护士的名字中这个字母出现了两次，她叫安妮
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, A-nn-ie.

529
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,930
你这个傻瓜（被男主角之前作品影响了）！我干得不错吧？
You fooler! Did I do good?

530
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,560
你做得非常好
You did great.

531
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,230
不过只有一件小事
There is just one little thing.

532
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,660
我没法用这些纸写作　你看，全都黏在一起　这样字容易被弄花
I can't work on this paper. See, it's Corrasable Bond. It smudges.

533
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,540
因此我想可以的话，你能不能到镇上去一趟
So I thought maybe, if you went back into town

534
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,080
给我买些白色的长纹纸回来
you could bring me some white long-grain mimeo.

535
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,340
但我买的是最贵的，我就不明白它怎么会被弄花呢
But mine cost the most, so I don't see how it can smudge.

536
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,380
过来，我给你看看
Come here, I'll show you.

539
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,180
弄花了

540
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,780
真的容易弄花，但话说回来　这看上去不是挺好看的嘛
It does smudge, after all. Isn't that fascinating.

541
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,530
我原本以为你会喜欢的
I thought you'd be interested.

542
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,200
我想让你参与写作的一切，安妮
I'd like for you to be in on everything, Annie.

543
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,410
不只是写完这本书，还有看着它是怎样写成的
Not just the finished book, but how it's written.

544
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,920
谢谢你替我着想这么多
Thank you for thinking of me.

545
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,050
我到镇上的时候还需要买别的什么吗？
Anything else I can get while I'm in town?

546
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,640
还有别的什么重要要求需要满足的吗？
Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying?

547
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,010
你需要一个袖珍录音机吗？
Would you like a tiny tape recorder?

548
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,720
或者买双手工制作的适合写作时穿的拖鞋？
Or how about a handmade set of writing slippers?

549
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,430
不，把纸买来就可以了
No, just the paper will be fine.

550
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,310
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

551
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,650
因为如果你希望的话，我可以把整座商店都给你搬回来
'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.

552
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,820
安妮，怎么了？
Annie, what's the matter?

553
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,400
怎么了？让我告诉你怎么了！
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter!

554
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,110
我所做的一切都是为了你！
I go out of my way for you!

555
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,990
我想方设法的让你高兴！
I do everything to try and make you happy!

556
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,040
我喂你吃饭，给你擦洗身体，替你穿衣服，可你是怎样报答我的？
I feed you, I clean you, I dress you, and what thanks do I get?

557
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,660
”你买错纸了，安妮“
"You bought the wrong paper, Annie.

558
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,540
”我没法在这种纸上写作，安妮！“
"I can't write on this paper, Annie!"

559
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,920
好的，我会把你要的蠢蛋纸买来
Well, I'll get your stupid paper

560
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,290
但是你最好表现出对我
but you just better start showing me

561
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,000
更多一点儿的感激之情，先生！
a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man!

564
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,680
该死
Shit.

565
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,620
来吧，你在书里边写过这个的，现在就试试吧
Come on, you've written about this, now do it.

567
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,510
你有想过吗？这还真的管用
What do you know? It actually works.

569
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,660
真令人惊奇
What a surprise.

570
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,330
你这个疯婆娘
You crazy bitch.

576
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,200
保罗，我把你要的纸买回来了
Paul, I've got your paper.

577
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,700
我希望这些应该够了　这是60刀长纹纸（刀，张数单位，一刀24张）
I hope it's enough. It's three reams of long-grain mimeo.

578
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,120
正是你要的那一种
Just the kind you asked for.

579
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,800
保罗，你在流汗
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration.

580
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,840
你脸色看上去很红　你刚才在干嘛？
Your color is very hectic. What have you been doing?

581
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,800
该死的你应该很清楚我刚才在干嘛
You know damn well what I've been doing.

582
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,640
我一直坐在这里忍受着痛苦
I've been sitting here suffering

583
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,140
我要吃药
I need my pills.

584
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,020
亲爱的你真可怜　等我把你扶上床再去替你把药拿来
Poor dear. Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.

585
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,850
我现在就要！
I want my pills now!

586
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
一会儿就好
It'll only take a second.

587
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,150
不！
No!

588
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,360
我要马上止痛，安妮
I want my pain to go away, Annie.

589
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,120
求你了，给我止痛
Please, make it go away.

590
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:37,330
求求你，安妮　求你了
Please, Annie. Please.

591
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,000
看见你这个样子真叫我心碎
It just breaks my heart to see you like this.

592
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,430
我在开车的时候想了很多
I've done a lot of thinking on the drive.

593
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,770
给你
Here you go.

594
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,690
我很肯定自己从不招人喜欢的主要原因
And I'm absolutely certain the main reason I've never been more popular

595
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,980
就是因为自己的脾气
is because of my temper.

596
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,780
你现在一定很生我的气　跟我说实话吧
You must be so mad at me. The truth, now.

597
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,620
嗯…有谁不会偶尔发泄点儿脾气呢？
Well... Who doesn't let off a little steam every once in a while?

598
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,200
我的天才在写作前需要休息
My genius needs his rest before he writes.

599
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,630
双脚抬起来
Footsies up.

600
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,420
行了
There you go.

601
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,690
给你这个　你有什么灵感的时候可以记下来免得忘了
Here. In case you think of any ideas.

602
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,980
噢，我可不希望经常用到它
Well, I wouldn't expect too much.

603
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,070
别说傻话了！你会有灵感的
Don't be silly! You'll be brilliant.

604
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,990
可以把我当作你的灵感之源
Think of me as your inspiration.

605
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,460
我对你有信心，亲爱的（好想翻成：我看好你哦）
I have faith in you, my darling.

606
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,500
接着
Catch this.

607
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,050
“亲爱的”
"My darling."

608
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,970
据推断保罗 谢尔顿现在极有可能已经死亡
The presumption must now be that Paul Sheldon is dead.

609
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,140
我们知道他设法爬出了车外
We know that he somehow managed to crawl outside his vehicle,

610
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:01,390
不过我们没能在事故现场附近地区找寻到他的尸体
but we have been unable to find his body anywhere in the vicinity of the accident.

611
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,310
我们还知道要是有人发现他的话
We also know that if anyone had found him

612
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,190
他们会将他送到地区医院去的
they would have taken him to an area hospital.

613
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:09,270
毫无疑问他被埋在附近这些积雪中的某个地方
Undoubtedly he is buried somewhere out there in the snow.

614
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,150
等雪融化后我们便能找到他
We'll find him after the first thaw.

615
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,110
当然，这首先要他没被野兽吃掉才行
That is, unless the animals didn't get to him first,

616
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,700
但这是极有可能发生的
which is a distinct possibility.

617
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,950
地方报纸...
Local papers...

618
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,160
刚才是由科罗拉多州警察总长谢尔曼 道格拉斯发表的
That was a statement from Colorado Police Chief Sherman Douglas.

619
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,490
关于著名小说家保罗 谢尔顿失踪事件的说明
The where abouts of famed novelist Paul Sheldon is...

620
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,000
我们会继续为您报道有关该事件的最新消息…
We will be updating you with the latest...

622
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,510
你并不认为他已经死了，对吗？
You don't think he's dead, do you?

623
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:38,220
嗯，他也许是死了，但不是他们说的那样
Well, he might well be, but not the way they say.

624
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,140
他根本没可能自己爬出那辆车
He never crawled out of that car by himself.

625
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,720
你可以看见车门上有凹痕
You can see the dents on the door there.

626
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,770
有人把他弄了出来
Someone pulled him out.

628
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,540
该死的…

629
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,720
很抱歉，保罗　但这完全不对
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong.

630
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,800
什么？
What?

631
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,470
你得全部重写
You'll have to do it over again.

632
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,970
它不值得你继续写下去　把它扔掉吧
It's not worthy of you. Throw it all out.

633
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,100
除了那个以我的名字命名的挖墓者
Except for that part of naming the gravedigger after me.

634
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,060
你可以继续保留它
You can leave that in.

635
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,650
我真的很重视你的评论
I really value your criticism

636
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,480
或许是我们都有点仓促了
but maybe we're being a little hasty here.

637
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,360
保罗，你写的不合理
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.

638
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,480
不合理?
Not fair?

639
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,610
没错
That's right.

640
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,360
我小时候在贝克尔斯菲（城市，位于美国加州）
When I was growing up in Bakersfield,

641
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,820
那时这个世界上我最喜欢的就是
my favorite thing in all the world

642
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,830
周六下午到电影院看连续剧
was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays.

643
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,120
<i>绝岭雄风</i>（影片名）
Cliffhangers.

644
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,000
那个我知道，先生！
I know that, Mister Man!

645
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,750
他们还叫它系列剧　我可不是傻瓜，这你该知道！
They also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know!

646
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,170
不管怎样，我最喜欢的还是<i>火箭人</i>
Anyway, my favorite was Rocketman,

647
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,130
有一次播出没有刹车那集
and once it was a no-brakes chapter

648
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,340
怀人们坏人把他困在山路上的一辆汽车里
and the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road,

649
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,180
把他打晕了然后把门关上焊死
and knocked him out and welded the doors shut

650
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,390
之后他们破坏了刹车然后把车推了出去
and tore out the brakes and started him to his death.

651
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:31,060
当他醒来后就试着控制方向然后逃出去
And he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out,

652
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,430
但是在他逃出之前汽车掉下了悬崖
but the car went off a cliff before he could escape,

653
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,730
汽车摔在地面起火燃烧
and it crashed and burned

654
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,650
而我是如此不安但又说不出的兴奋！
and I was so upset and excited!

655
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,190
而第二个星期，你最好相信我那时坐在第一排
And the next week, you better believe I was first in line.

656
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,360
他们开始放映前通常都会重播上周的结尾
And they always start with the end of the last week

657
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,690
放的还是火箭人正在试图逃出那段（这个故事有寓意）
and there was Rocketman, trying to get out

658
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,280
眼看就快到了悬崖那里
and here comes the cliff

659
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,660
就在汽车冲出悬崖的一瞬间他跳了出来
and just before the car went off the cliff he jumped free

660
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,450
于是所有的孩子们都欢呼起来！
and all the kids cheered!

661
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,910
但是我没有欢呼　我立刻站起来大声喊道
But I didn't cheer. I stood right up and started shouting

662
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,920
“上周演的不是这样的！（女主角那时就有反脱出心理）
"This isn't what happened last week!

663
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,880
你们全都得了健忘症吗？“
Have you all got amnesia?

664
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,880
”他们在愚弄我们！这不合理！“
"They just cheated us! This isn't fair!"

665
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,760
”他没能从那辆欠日的车里逃出来！“
"He didn't get out of the cockadoodie car!"

666
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,890
他们在连续剧里经常这样愚弄人
They always cheated like that in chapter plays.

667
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:20,520
但你不能这样　不能这样对我的米瑟瑞但
But not you. Not with my Misery.

668
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,480
还记得伊安骑马去找柯利尔医生吗？
Remember Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary

669
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,900
就在上一本书的结尾，但是他的马没能跃过那道篱笆
at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence,

670
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,410
于是伊安摔伤了肩膀和肋骨，一整夜都躺在那条沟里
and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay all night in the ditch

671
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,820
他根本不可能到达医生那儿
and he never reached the doctor

672
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,240
因此也就没可能进行什么试验性的输血
so there couldn't have been any experimental blood transfusion

673
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,160
来拯救她的生命
that saved her life.

674
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,750
于是最终米瑟瑞长眠于地下，保罗
Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul

675
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,170
所以你要从那时候开始写
so you'll have to start there.

676
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,130
这样就合理了？那我还继续写吗？
Is it fair? Should I continue?

677
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,300
你最好这样！
You better!

678
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,470
噢，保罗！当伊安意识到
Oh, Paul! When Ian realized that

679
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,970
他们之所以会将米瑟瑞活埋是因为
the reason they'd buried Misery alive

680
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,720
蜂蜇让她暂时陷入了昏迷！
was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma!

681
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,970
而当挖墓工威尔克斯回想起30年前
And when Gravedigger Wilkes remembered how 30 years earlier

682
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,220
同样的事也在伊芙莲 海德小姐身上发生过！
the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

683
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,350
于是年迈的柯利尔医生就此推断米瑟瑞
And then old Dr. Cleary deduced that Misery

684
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,480
必定是伊芙莲 海德小姐失散多年的女儿
must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter

685
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,440
这罕见的致命蜂蜇教我的心都要跳出来了！
because of the rarity of deadly bee stings, my heart just leapt!

686
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,990
从第一本书开始我就知道
I've known from the very first book

687
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,650
米瑟瑞必定出身贵族
that Misery had to be born of nobility

688
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,110
看来我没有猜错！
and I was right!

689
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
没错（接着无语）
Yeah.

690
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,490
保罗，等你完成每个章节后就能立刻让我看吗？
Paul, can I read each chapter when you're finished? 

691
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,790
我可以补上那些”N“
I can fill in the "N's."

692
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,040
现在伊安将她从墓里挖出来，她是会跟从前一样
Will she be her old self now that Ian has dug her out

693
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,500
还是会失去记忆?
or will she have amnesia?

694
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,750
那你的等着
Have to wait.

695
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:05,960
她依然会以那种特别的，完美的方式去爱着他吗？
Will she still love him with that special, perfect love?

696
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,460
你还是得等
You'll have to wait.

697
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,840
一点儿提示都没有？
Not even a hint?

698
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,050
嗯-哼
Uh-uh.

700
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:16,010
米瑟瑞没有死，米瑟瑞还活着！这太浪漫了！
Misery's alive, Misery's alive! It's so romantic!

701
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,350
这让整间屋子都充满了浪漫的气息！
This whole house is gonna be filled with romance!

702
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,640
我要放利勃瑞斯的唱片！
I'm gonna put on my Liberace records!

703
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,690
你相当喜欢利勃瑞斯的，对吧？
You do like Liberace, don't you?

704
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,190
当他演出<i>城市电波</i>的时候
Whenever he played Radio City

705
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,740
你认为坐在第一排的人会是谁？
who do you think was right there in the front row?

706
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,910
我会一整天的放唱片，激发你的创作灵感
I'm gonna play my records all day long, to inspire you.

707
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,620
他一直都是我的最爱
He's my all-time favorite.

708
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,200
安妮
Annie.

709
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,750
今晚你能同我共进晚餐吗？
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

710
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,630
为了庆祝米瑟瑞的归来
To celebrate Misery's Return.

711
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,550
没有你的帮助我是办不到的
I couldn't have done it without you.

712
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:55,930
保罗
Paul.

713
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:59,890
这真是一种荣幸
It would be an honor.

714
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,900
不，他不在这里
No, he's not here.

715
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,230
我不知道他在什么地方
I don't know where he is.

716
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,240
他从来都不跟我做任何解释
He never tells me anything anymore.

717
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,570
很可能他在外面什么地方有了外遇吧
He's probably out havin' an affair somewhere.

718
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,910
等等　他回来了
Wait a minute. He's comin' in now.

719
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,450
是金 泰勒
It's Jim Taylor.

720
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,290
他想知道你跟谁有外遇
He wants to know who you're havin' an affair with.

721
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:25,500
金，你好吗？有什么事吗？
Hello, Jim. What's doin'?

722
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,670
金，这我们以前在电话中就说过了
Jim, we've been through this before.

723
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,260
只要你把长椅伸出你的店门
If you're gonna have benches out in front of your store

724
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,840
人们就会坐在上面
people are gonna want to sit on 'em.

725
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,970
当然，我也不喜欢他
Well, I don't like him, either,

726
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,640
但我不会走过去
but I'm not gonna come over there

727
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,520
叫他离开
and tell him to move.

728
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,850
替我问候丹尼斯　再见
Give my best to Denise. Bye.

729
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,570
嗯，不论她是谁，她一定很爱看书
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.

730
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:55,150
维吉尼亚，你觉得我仍旧”精力“充沛真是令我受宠若惊
Virginia, I'm flattered that you think I've got that much energy.

731
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,410
我认为即便我找不到保罗 谢尔顿
I figured that if I can't find Paul Sheldon,

732
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:02,370
但起码我能查出他到底在写什么
at least I can find out what he wrote about.

733
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,120
你想查出什么？
What do you expect to find?

734
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,290
一个人在暴风雪中开车驶下悬崖的故事？
A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

735
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,630
你看，又在对我进行嘲讽
You see, it's just that kind of sarcasm

736
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:14,840
不过这也让我们的婚姻相当刺激
that's given our marriage real spice.

737
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,300
[I'LL BE SEEING YOU PLAYING]

738
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,060
[SINGING] I'll be seeing you

739
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,600
In all the old familiar places

740
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,650
我希望你会喜欢
I hope you like it.

741
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,070
看上去棒极了
It looks wonderful.

742
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,150
你也一样
So do you.

744
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,140
我从没吃过这么好吃的肉糕　你是怎么做的？
I've never had meatloaf this good. What do you do to it?

745
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:10,520
我的秘诀就是从来都用新鲜的西红柿，而不是罐头里的
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned.

746
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,190
此外为了增加一些口感
And to give it that little extra zip,

747
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:14,360
我将斯帕姆午餐肉同碎牛肉混合在一起
I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

748
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:21,120
在纽约的餐厅里可吃不到这些
Can't get this in a restaurant in New York.

749
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,710
我们干一杯吧
Let's have a toast.

750
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,830
干杯?
A toast?

751
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,460
对　为米瑟瑞干杯
Yes. To Misery.

752
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,630
我来给你斟酒
Let me pour you some wine

754
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:40,990
不
No

755
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,270
为米瑟瑞干杯
To Misery.

756
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:02,160
等一下　我们得好好享受这顿晚餐　有蜡烛吗？
Wait. Let's do this right. Do you have any candles?

758
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,370
我不知道　但我想应该有
I don't know. I think so.

759
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,040
我这就去找找
I'll go look.

760
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,840
你是之前学过装饰还是说本身就有这个天赋呢？
Did you study decorating or do you just have a flair?

761
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,640
噢，你真坏！
Oh, you!

762
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,390
我不过是这些年来一直打理着这里罢了
I just picked things up over the years.

763
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,060
嗯，它的风格很像你
Well, it certainly says you.

764
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,190
你真这么认为吗?
You really think so?

765
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,690
绝对是那样
Absolutely.

766
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,060
听着，如果你找不到的话，也没关系
Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay.

767
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,320
我想现在这样也已经很不错了
I just thought it'd be nice.

768
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,740
你不是在开玩笑吧？要是有人之前跟我说自己有一天
Are you kidding? If anyone had ever told me that one day

769
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,700
会在自己的家里同保罗 谢尔顿一起共进烛光晚餐
I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house

770
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,990
那我一定得好好检查自己的两条腿
I would have checked both legs

771
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,200
看看别人是拿哪条在开玩笑！
to see which one was bein' pulled!

772
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,250
这样可以吧?
Will this do?

773
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,330
太完美了
It's perfect.

774
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,550
为米瑟瑞还有安妮 威尔克斯干杯，是她令米瑟瑞复活了
To Misery and to Annie Wilkes, who brought her back to life.

775
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:09,930
保罗，每当一想到这个我就浑身起鸡皮疙瘩！
Paul, I get goose bumps every time I think about it!

777
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,900
天啊，我都做了什么?
My God, what have I done?

778
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,940
我很抱歉，保罗!
I'm so sorry, Paul!

779
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:19,570
我把你浪漫的干杯给搞砸了
I ruined your beautiful toast!

780
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,400
你会原谅我吗?
Will you ever forgive me?

781
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,280
来，我再倒一杯
Here, let me pour another one.

782
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:36,250
我们可以装作没有发生过这件事吗？
Can we pretend this never happened?

783
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,760
为米瑟瑞干杯
To Misery.

784
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,760
为米瑟瑞
To Misery.

786
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:03,570
第5章

787
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,410
第12章

788
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,010
保罗，毫无疑问这是你笔下最完美的米瑟瑞
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.

789
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:04,770
第19章

791
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,920
这是你的药
Here's your pills.

792
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:45,880
安妮?
Annie?

793
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,880
安妮，怎么了？
Annie, what is it?

794
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,720
雨
The rain.

795
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,720
有时候下雨会令我心情阴郁
Sometimes it gives me the blues.

796
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,480
当你最初来到这里的时候
When you first came here

797
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,900
我只爱保罗 谢尔顿你作为作家的那部分
I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon.

798
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,410
但现在我意识到自己同样也爱着他其余的部分（有肉体的啊！崩溃）
But now I know I love the rest of him, too.

799
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,210
我很清楚你并不爱我
I know you don't love me.

800
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,080
别说你爱我
Don't say you do.

801
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:30,380
你是那样的英俊，才华横溢，还是世人皆知的名人
You're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world

802
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:35,260
而我没有电影明星那样的模样和身材（但大妈你是电影明星）
and I'm not a movie-star type.

803
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,190
你永远也不会了解失去一个像你这样的人对我来说是多么恐怖的事
You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you

804
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,320
如果你跟我一样
if you're someone like me.

805
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,280
你为什么还要放弃我？
Why would you lose me?

806
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,490
书已经快完成了
The book's almost finished.

807
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,830
你的腿也好多了
Your legs are getting better.

808
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,960
很快你便会想要离开
Soon you'll be wanting to leave.

809
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,800
我干嘛要离开？我喜欢这儿
Why would I leave? I like it here.

810
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:14,300
你能这样说真好，不过我打赌这绝对不是真的
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.

811
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,070
我拿着这把枪
I have this gun.

813
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,830
有时我都在想着怎么使用它
Sometimes I think about using it.

814
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,000
我最好还是出去吧
I better go now.

815
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,090
说不定我会把子弹放进去
I might put bullets in it.

819
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,520
"有种凌驾于人类法律之上的审判"
"There is a justice higher than that of man.

820
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,940
"我会由他来裁决"
"I will be judged by Him."

821
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,190
什么?
What?

822
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,690
他们把米瑟瑞推上了法庭
They're haulin' Misery into court.

823
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,480
很不错
That's nice.

824
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:06,910
有种凌驾于人类法律之上的审判
There is a justice higher than that of man.

825
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,960
我会由他来裁决
I will be judged by Him.

826
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,900
保罗 谢尔顿到底身在何处? 
据推测保罗 谢尔顿已经死亡
-失踪作家的汽车被发现埋在雪堆中

827
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,870
一路往事

（方框内：Elridge郡纪念医院这起婴儿死亡原因尚未查明）

837
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,290
医院护士因婴儿在院中死亡而受到质询

838
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,880
1984年12月7日，星期五
医院育儿室再次发生婴儿死亡

839
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,900
妇产科护士被判入狱
“魔鬼女士”因涉嫌造成近期发生的婴儿死亡事件而被捕

846
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,830
欢迎到来[情牵一线]
[MAN CHATTERING ON TV]

847
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:24,130
旧时的浪漫结合现代技术

849
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,100
早上见
See you in the morning.

853
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:35,200
本来现在应该进入这个节目的尾声了
I'm supposed to lead to the finale of my show right now,

854
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,160
但我度过了如此美好的时光...
but I'm having such a wonderful time that I have...

855
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,410
保罗
Paul.

856
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,960
嗯？
Hmm?

857
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:48,090
我知道你曾出去过
I know you've been out.

858
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,260
什么？
What?

859
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,600
你曾离开过你的房间
You've been out of your room.

860
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,520
不，我没有
No, I haven't.

861
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,770
保罗，我书房里的小陶企鹅一直都是面向着正南方向的
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south

862
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:10,360
我不明白你在说些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

863
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,780
陶企鹅?
Ceramic penguin?

864
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,450
你是在找这个吗？（大妈心细得很，企鹅都不放过，何况这个）
Is this what you're looking for?

865
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,200
我知道你曾出去过两次，保罗
I know you've been out twice, Paul.

866
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,830
起初我弄不明白你是怎么办到的
At first I couldn't figure out how you did it,

867
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,500
不过昨晚我找到了你的钥匙
but last night I found your key.

868
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:33,380
我知道自己把剪贴簿留在了外边
I know I left my scrapbook out.

869
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,970
我能想象你会怎么看我
I can imagine what you might be thinking of me.

870
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:38,640
不过要知道，保罗，这没什么
But you see, Paul, it's all okay.

871
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,140
昨晚我的思维相当清晰
Last night it came so clear.

872
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,480
我意识到你不过是需要更多时间
I realize you just need more time.

873
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,650
最终你会愿意留在这里
Eventually you'll come to accept the idea of being here.

874
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,570
保罗，你听说过
Paul, do you know about the early days

875
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,940
金伯利（南非）钻石矿场过去的事吗？
at the Kimberley diamond mines?

876
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:55,700
你知道他们是怎样对付那些偷钻石的土著工人的？
Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds?

877
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,240
别担心　他们没有杀掉他们
Don't worry. They didn't kill them.

878
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,080
那样就像仅仅因为坏了一根弹簧
That would be like junking a Mercedes

879
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,950
便丢弃一辆梅赛德斯奔驰车一样
just because it had a broken spring.

880
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,080
不，一旦他们抓住偷钻石的工人，他们就得设法保证
No, if they caught them they had to make sure

881
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,460
工人们既能够继续工作
they could go on working,

882
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,590
但同时再也不能逃走
but they also had to make sure they could never run away.

883
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,250
这个办法就被称为”跛行“
The operation was called "hobbling."

884
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:25,350
安妮，不管你现在打算做什么
Annie, whatever you're thinking about doing,

885
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,190
求你不要那样做
please don't do it.

886
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,320
安妮，看在上帝的…
Annie, for God's...

887
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,320
亲爱的　相信我
Darling. Trust me.

888
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,450
上帝的份上！
God's sake!

889
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,530
这是最好的办法
It's for the best.

890
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,950
安妮，求求你!
Annie, please!

892
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,120
快完了　还剩一只脚
Almost done. Just one more.

893
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,220
上帝，我爱你
God, I love you.

896
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,080
你这欠日的！
You cockadoodie!

897
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,180
去你的吧！
Turn on this!

898
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,350
你这个傻瓜！
You poop!

899
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,160
离它远点儿，好吗？
Just leave it, all right?

900
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,450
我喜欢那种口气！
I like that tone!

901
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,120
你要我跟你说多少遍？
How many times do I have to tell you?

902
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,370
我这些东西摆放都是有规律的！那该死的玩意儿在哪儿？
I have a system here! Where the hell is that thing? 

903
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:11,620
什么玩意儿?
What thing?

904
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:12,790
就是那玩意儿！（我都糊涂了…）
The thing!

905
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,460
找到了，就在它应该待的位置上
Here it is, right where it's supposed to be.

906
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,630
这是什么？
What is it?

907
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,550
我也不太清楚　也许什么都不是
I'm not sure. Maybe nothin'.

908
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,840
噢，我很高兴你找到它了
Well, I'm glad you found it.

909
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,510
你又在刺激我了
There's that spice again.

910
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:52,560
医院育儿室再次发生婴儿死亡

911
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,830
妇产科护士被判入狱
“魔鬼女士”因涉嫌造成近期发生的婴儿死亡被捕

912
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,180
魔鬼女士声称自己无罪

913
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:18,290
威尔克斯站在法院外的台阶上对记者说：

914
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:23,250
“有种凌驾于人类法律之上的审判，我会由他来裁决”

915
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,700
“有种凌驾于人类法律之上的审判，我会由他来裁决”

916
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:43,550
过来，米瑟　过来
Come on, Misie. Come on.

917
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:46,090
嗨，小可爱
Hi, pumpkin.

919
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:52,430
真是孩子气！走吧，米瑟瑞
Such a kidder! Come on, Misery.

920
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:04,530
嘿，皮特
Hey, Pete.

921
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,820
老兄
Buster.

922
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,780
回答我几件事情
Answer me a couple things.

923
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,660
如果我能的话
If I can.

924
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,250
你有保罗 谢尔顿的新书吗?
Do you have any new Paul Sheldon books?

925
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:13,790
噢，之前我们有一堆呢
Well, we had a batch.

926
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,960
3天内全卖光了
Sold 'em all out in three days.

927
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:20,290
你说不定知道威尔克斯女士有没有从这里买过一本，你还记得吗？
You wouldn't happen to know if Miss Wilkes bought one of them, would you?

928
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:24,010
你不是在开玩笑吧？那位兄台只要每次一有新书出版
Are you kiddin'? Every time that fella writes a new book

929
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:26,760
她必定会要我替她把第一本留下
she has me set aside the first copy.

930
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:30,970
她最近有购买什么奇怪的东西吗？
Has she been buyin' anything odd lately?

931
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,680
安妮 威尔克斯女士？还不是老样子
Miss Wilkes? Same old stuff.

932
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,400
除非你觉得买纸也算奇怪
Lest you call paper odd.

933
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,810
报纸？
Newspaper?

934
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,690
不　是打字纸
No. The typin' kind.

935
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:46,200
就是那种　除此之外没什么好奇怪的
That kind. Nothin' odd about that.

936
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,030
威尔克斯女士做了什么不好的事吗？
Miss Wilkes done somethin'?

937
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,410
没事了
Not a thing.

940
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,970
我不认为自己会理解你　我给你做饭
I don't think I'll ever understand you. I cook your meals,

941
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:56,140
我全天24小时对你进行特护
I tend to you practically 24 hours a day

942
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,430
而你却不停地反抗我
and you continue to fight me.

943
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,850
我们俩什么时候才能建立某种信任呢？
（她的话越恶心越好，其实我也很辛苦）
When are we going to develop a sense of trust?

944
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,510
噢，我的天
Oh, my.

945
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,640
抱歉，我并非想要惊吓到你
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you

946
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,060
但是你甚至都没有让我来的及敲门
but you didn't give me a chance to knock.

947
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,720
我猜你能从我的反应中看出
I guess you can tell from my reaction

948
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:40,140
我并不习惯于有人到访
I'm not all that used to visitors out here.

949
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,600
我能为你做什么吗？
What can I do for you?

950
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:46,480
嗯，我想知道，你是否碰巧知道什么关于保罗 谢尔顿的事吗？
Well, I was wonderin', do you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon?

951
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:48,650
你想知道什么?
What do you want to know?

952
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,110
是这样，随便你告诉我什么都可能会有帮助
Well, anything you could tell me might help.

953
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,320
嗯，他45年前出生于马萨诸塞州的伍斯特郡
Well, he was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, 45 years ago

954
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,240
是富兰克林 谢尔顿和他妻子海伦 谢尔顿的独子
the only child of Franklin and Helene Sheldon,

955
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:58,830
学生时代成绩平平，主修历史…
mediocre student,majored in History...

956
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:02,000
嗯那些…那些并不是我想要知道的信息
Well that... That isn't exactly the kind of information I'm after.

957
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,540
你也知道，他已经失踪很长一段时间了…
You see, he's been missin' for quite some time now...

958
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,500
我知道　那让人很不安
I know. It's so upsetting.

959
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,840
我是他的头号书迷
I'm his number-one fan.

960
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,510
他的书我全都有　甚至他写下的每一句话
I've got all his books. Every sentence he ever put down.

961
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:13,550
我对自己拥有如此齐全的保罗 谢尔顿收藏感到非常骄傲
（这次先收活人，再收木乃伊噢～）
I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection.

962
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,350
噢，我就是这样，话说起来没完没了
Well, here I am, prattling on

963
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,680
完全把礼貌二字抛到了九霄云外
and my manners have just flown away.

964
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,770
我还没邀请您进来坐一下呢　请
I haven't invited you in. Please.

965
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,270
谢谢
Thank you.

966
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,940
当然，你也一定知道那场可怕的事故了
Of course, you must know all about that horrible accident.

967
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,730
介意我四处看看吗?
Mind if I take a look around?

968
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,110
当然不会
Of course not.

969
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,740
那个事故几乎也要了我的命
That accident almost killed me, too.

970
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,620
当我从新闻中听到这个消息的时候我便开始祈祷
I prayed when I heard the news.

971
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:40,240
我跪下祈求那不是真的
I got down on my knees and I begged for it not to be true.

972
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:41,910
接下来我说的话也许会让您想发笑
You're gonna laugh at what I'm about to say

973
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,330
您就笑好了，我不在乎的
but go ahead, I don't care.

974
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,880
就在我祈祷的时候，上帝告诉我要我做好准备
When I was praying, God told me to get ready.

975
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,960
准备什么？
Get ready for what?

976
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:53,090
成为他的接替者
To be his replacement.

977
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:56,010
他给那么多人带来了如此多的欢乐
He gave so much pleasure to so many people

978
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,890
而这些天来世界正面临欢乐短缺
and there's a shortage of pleasure on the planet these days,

979
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:01,020
要是你没有注意到
in case you hadn't noticed.

980
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,890
上帝他告诉我，因为我是他的头号书迷
God told me, since I was his number-one fan,

981
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,440
因此我就该把自己当作保罗 谢尔顿继续编写新的故事
that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon.

982
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,690
于是我便去了镇上买了部打字机
So I went to town, and I bought a typewriter,

983
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,900
还有打字纸
and paper to type on

984
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,400
同保罗 谢尔顿用的是一样的
the same kind Paul Sheldon used.

985
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:17,360
我把客房改成了一间写作室
And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio.

986
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:18,910
您想进去看看吗？
Would you like to see it?

987
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:19,990
当然
Sure.

988
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,240
就在这边
It's right this way.

989
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:34,260
我知道他是怎样写作的　他在之前的那些美妙的故事中
I know how he wrote. The kinds of words he used

990
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,590
都用了些什么样的词语
the wonderful stories he told.

991
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,890
我足足花了四周时间
I've spent the last four weeks

992
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:40,100
来试着模仿他的写作风格
trying to write like Paul Sheldon,

993
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,970
但是没有成功
but I can't do it right.

994
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:47,020
我不断的试着，我知道所有的词句，可写出来却又不一样了
I try and I try, and I know all the words, but it's just not the same.

995
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,900
噢，也许还要再花一些时间才能掌握
Well, maybe it takes a while to get the hang of it.

996
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,150
我可以让您看看已经写好的几百页
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine

997
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,940
然后您可以告诉我您认为它写得怎么样
and you could tell me what you think.

998
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:56,780
我对评论不在行
I'm not much of a critic.

999
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:59,450
嗯，我只是想…
Well, I just thought...

1000
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:02,200
噢，瞧瞧我　你说不定会认为我这里从来就没来过客人！
Oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a guest before!

1001
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,990
你想来杯热可可吗？
Would you like a nice hot cup of cocoa?

1002
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,080
不，说真的，我不…
No, really, I don't...

1003
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,460
这不麻烦
It's no trouble.

1004
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,710
是己经弄好了的
There's some already made.

1005
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,720
你一个人住在这里想必很孤单吧
Must get lonely, livin' out here all by yourself.

1006
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,140
嗯，我总是说，若你不能独处
Well, I always say, if you can't enjoy your own company

1007
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,600
又如何同别人相处呢
you're not fit company for anyone else.

1008
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,060
嗯，你说得很有道理
Well, you've got a point there.

1010
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:36,050
给你的
Here you are.

1011
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,090
噢，谢谢，威尔克斯女士
Well, thanks, Miss Wilkes,

1012
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:40,340
但我不想再耽误你的时间了
but I don't want to take up any more of your time.

1013
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,050
我最好还是走了
I best be goin'.

1014
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:47,100
不过你甚至都还没有尝一下你的那杯可可呢
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

1015
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:51,270
我肯定它的味道会相当好，不过我真的该回去了
I'm sure it's wonderful, but I really should be gettin' back.

1016
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,900
如果您不介意，或许我
If you wouldn't mind, perhaps I could

1017
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,570
找时间改日再来拜访你
pay you another visit sometime.

1018
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:03,700
那我会很高兴的，现在您该认识路了
I'd be delighted, now that you know the way.

1020
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,340
威尔克斯女士?
Miss Wilkes?

1021
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,050
威尔克斯女士，你没事吧?
Miss Wilkes, are you all right?

1022
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,640
我在这儿！
Here!

1023
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,310
在这里！我在下面！
Here! I'm down here!

1024
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,520
我在下面！
I'm down here!

1025
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,940
谢尔顿先生？
Mr. Sheldon?

1026
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,700
别难过了，保罗
Don't feel bad, Paul.

1027
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:55,790
这是迟早都要发生的事
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

1028
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,000
这是个预兆
It's a sign.

1029
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:03,970
你看，我已经知道自己为什么被选中来救你的命了
You see, I've known for some time why I was chosen to save you.

1030
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:07,300
我们俩注定就是要永远在一起的
You and I were meant to be together forever.

1031
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:09,810
不过现在我们俩留在在这个世界的时间必须得结束了
But now our time in this world must end.

1032
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,180
但是不用担心，保罗
But don't worry, Paul.

1033
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,190
我已经做好了必要的准备
I've prepared for what must be done.

1034
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:21,980
我在枪里放了两颗子弹，一颗是你的，一颗是我的
I put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for me.

1035
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,700
亲爱的，这将是多么美妙啊
Darling, it'll be so beautiful.

1036
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:36,370
巫师牌®
木炭助燃剂
你品尝的是食物…而不是燃料！

1037
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,590
不用害怕
Now don't be afraid.

1038
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,260
我爱你
I love you.

1039
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:55,600
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1040
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:02,440
你说的对　我们注定就是要在一起的（恶心死自己）
And you're right. We are meant to be together.

1041
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:05,940
我也知道我们必须得死
And I know we must die.

1042
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,450
但是必须得让米瑟瑞活着
But it must be so that Misery can live.

1043
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:18,330
我们能让米瑟瑞永远的活下去
We have the power to give Misery eternal life.

1044
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,170
我们必须完成这本书
We must finish the book.

1045
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:29,090
但是没时间了　很快其他人就会赶来的
But the time is now. Soon others will come.

1046
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:32,890
它就快完成了
It's almost finished.

1047
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,970
等到黎明时
By dawn

1048
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,980
我们就能让米瑟瑞重新回到这个世界
we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.

1049
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,260
我去给你弄些吃的
I'll fix you something to eat.

1050
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:18,140
（三天三夜）（米瑟瑞在哭）

1051
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,900
保罗，我都快迷死了！
Paul, I'm dying!

1052
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:29,030
她最终是同伊安还是同温德松在一起？
Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne?

1053
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:31,160
你马上就能知道
You'll know very soon.

1054
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,200
我刚开始看最后一章
I've just started the last chapter.

1055
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:39,540
你知道，当我完成的时候，我希望一切都是完美的
You know, when I finish, I'd like everything to be perfect.

1056
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,620
我会需要三样东西　
I'll need three things.

1057
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,210
什么东西？
What things?

1058
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:47,460
你是说你不知道吗？
You mean you don't know?

1060
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,260
我开玩笑而已，傻瓜
I was foolin', silly.

1061
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:54,510
你需要一支香烟，你曾经吸烟不过戒掉了
You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit,

1062
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:58,140
除了当你写完一本书的时候，你才会抽上一支
except when you finish a book, and you have just one.

1063
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,270
还有点烟用的火柴
And the match is to light it

1064
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:04,480
你还要一杯香槟，Dom Perignon牌的
and you need one glass of champagne, Dom Perignon.

1065
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:07,570
没错，Dom Perignon牌的
Dom Perignon it is.

1066
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,420
安妮，安妮？
Annie, Annie?

1067
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,090
什么事，保罗？
Yes, Paul?

1068
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:38,060
我快写完了
I'm almost done.

1069
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,850
噢，保罗，这简直太浪漫了！
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic!

1070
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:44,270
伊安同温德松为了娶米瑟瑞而进行决斗
Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand.

1071
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:47,060
是伊安赢了吗？可别告诉我
Does Ian win? Don't tell me.

1072
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:48,440
是温德松赢了，是这样吗？
It's Windthorne, right?

1073
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,820
你一分钟内就会知道所有的答案
You'll know everything in a minute.

1074
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,150
去把香槟拿来
Get the champagne.

1076
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,480
我做得还好吗？
Did I do good?

1077
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:34,820
你做得非常完美
You did perfect.

1078
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,660
只有一件事例外
Except for one thing.

1079
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,040
这次我们要两只杯子
This time we'll need two glasses.

1080
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,370
噢，保罗
Oh, Paul.

1081
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:22,740
想想吧，这么多年来
Remember how, for all those years

1082
01:39:22,830 --> 01:39:25,700
一直都没有人知道谁才是米瑟瑞的生父？
nobody knew who Misery's real father was?

1083
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:28,330
或者他们能否重聚？
Or if they'd ever be reunited?

1084
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:29,920
答案全部都在这里
It's all right here.

1085
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,880
她最终是嫁给伊安，还是温德松？
Does she finally marry Ian, or will it be Windthorne?

1086
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,760
也全都在这里
It's all right here.

1087
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:40,180
保罗，你不能这样！
Paul, you can't!

1088
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,720
为什么不能？我从你那里学的
Why not? I learned it from you.

1089
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:48,890
不，不，不要！米瑟瑞！不要毁掉我的米瑟瑞！
No, no, no! Not Misery! Not my Misery!

1090
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,900
不！不要毁掉我的米瑟瑞！
No! Not my Misery!

1093
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,830
我要杀了你，你这个撒谎的贱人！
I'm gonna kill you, you lying cocksucker!

1097
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,950
来呀，你想拿回它吗？你想要吗？吃下去吧！
Here, you want it? You want it? Eat it!

1098
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:53,790
吃到噎死你，你这个恶心，变态的疯子！
Eat it till you choke, you sick, twisted fuck!

1103
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,660
一年半之后

1104
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:49,570
这就是第一本
（书名：J.飞利浦 史东的高等教育）
This is it. The very first copy.

1105
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:53,450
我听说时代杂志对这本书的评论好像不错
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.

1106
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,000
那还是第一次
That'll be a first.

1107
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,330
我在时代周刊和新闻周刊的联络人告诉我他们都极力赞扬这部作品
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves.

1108
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:00,210
不要笑，但这还是第一次
And don't laugh, but for the first time

1109
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:02,420
我觉得你会获得什么奖项
I think you've got a shot at some prizes.

1110
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,090
很好
Great.

1111
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:06,300
我原本以为你会很激动
I thought you'd be thrilled.

1112
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,090
你终于被认真看待了
You're being taken seriously.

1113
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,140
我很高兴评论家们喜欢它
I'm delighted the critics are liking it

1114
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:12,390
同样我希望读者们也喜欢
and I hope the people like it, too.

1115
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:15,180
但那时我为自己写的
But I wrote it for me.

1116
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:19,560
别当我疯了，不过…
Now, don't think I'm completely nuts, but...

1117
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,280
以某种方式来说，安妮 威尔克斯 
In some way, Annie Wilkes,

1118
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:27,110
以及那整段经历
that whole experience,

1119
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:30,700
确实给了我帮助
helped me.

1120
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:32,830
保罗，既然你提起她
Paul, since you brought her up

1121
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:36,410
我得问你一下否则我会被逐出经纪人联会
I have to ask you this or I'll be drummed out of the agents' union.

1122
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:40,380
要是把在那间屋子里发生的事情写成一部纪实文学你觉得怎样？
How would you feel about a non-fiction book about what went on in that house?

1123
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,880
噢，马修，如果我不是这么了解你，我会认为你提议
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting

1124
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,420
要我发掘自己这一生中最为恐怖的经历出来
I dredge up the worst horror of my life

1125
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:47,300
只是为了让我们能够赚几个钱
just so we can makea few bucks.

1126
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,890
我还以为你已经摆脱那件事了
I thought you were over it.

1127
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:53,680
我不知道是否有人可以完全忘掉那样的事情
I don't know if anyone could ever totally get over something like that.

1128
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,180
这很奇怪
It's weird.

1129
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:59,020
虽然我知道她死了
Even though I know she's dead,

1130
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,520
不过我偶尔仍会想起她
I still think about her once in a while.

1131
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:07,530
对不起　我并非想要打扰你们，但您就是保罗 谢尔顿吗?
Excuse me. I don't mean to bother you, but are you Paul Sheldon?

1132
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:09,110
是的
Yes.

1133
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,820
我只想告诉您我是您的头号书迷
I just want to tell you I'm your number-one fan.

1134
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,870
你真好
That's very sweet of you.

1135
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,750
[SINGING] I'll be seeing you

1136
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:28,800
In all the old familiar places

1137
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:35,260
That this heart of mine embraces

1138
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:39,430
All day through

1139
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:48,780
In that small cafe

1140
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:54,320
The park across the way

1141
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:02,170
The children's carousel

1142
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,420
The chestnut trees

1143
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:09,510
The wishin' well

1144
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:15,970
I'll be seeing you

1145
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:20,640
In every lovely summer's day

1146
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:27,690
In every thing that's light and gay

1147
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:34,490
I'll always think of you that way

1148
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:42,540
I'll find you In the morning sun

1149
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:47,960
And when the night is new

1150
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:53,260
I'll be looking at the moon

1151
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:57,970
But I'll be seeing you

1152
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,980
I'll be seeing you

1153
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:11,400
In every lovely summer's day

1154
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:16,360
I'll be seeing you in every thing that's light and gay

1155
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:21,790
I'll always think of you that way

1156
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:30,420
I'll find you In the morning sun

1157
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:35,510
And when the night is new

1158
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:43,890
I'll be looking at the moon

1159
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:50,650
But I'll be seeing you
