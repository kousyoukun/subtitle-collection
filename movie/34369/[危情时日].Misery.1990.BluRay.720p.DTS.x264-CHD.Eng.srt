That was when I first discovered Misery.

647
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,130
and once it was a no-brakes chapter

648
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,340
and the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road,

649
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,180
and knocked him out and welded the doors shut

650
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,390
and tore out the brakes and started him to his death.

651
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:31,060
And he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out,

652
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,430
but the car went off a cliff before he could escape,

653
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,730
and it crashed and burned

654
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,650
and I was so upset모and excited!

655
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,190
And the next week,모you better believe모I was first in line.

656
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,360
And they always start with the end of the last week

657
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,690
and there was Rocketman, trying to get out

658
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,280
and here comes the cliff

659
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,660
and just before the car모went off the cliff모he jumped free

660
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,450
and all the kids cheered!

661
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,910
But I didn't cheer. I stood right up and started shouting

662
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,920
"This isn't what happened last week!

But not you. Not with my Misery.

668

Remember Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary

669
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,900
at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence,

670
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,410
and Ian broke his shoulder모and his ribs and lay all night in the ditch

671
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,820
and he never reached the doctor

672
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,240
so there couldn't have been any experimental blood transfusion

673
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,160
that saved her life.

674
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,750
Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul

675
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,170
so you'll have to start there.

676
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,130
Is it fair? Should I continue?

You better!

678
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,470
Oh, Paul! When Ian realized that

679
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,970
the reason they'd buried Misery alive

680
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,720
was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma!

681
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,970
And when Gravedigger Wilkes remembered how 30 years earlier

682
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,220
the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

683
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,350
And then old Dr. Cleary deduced that Misery

684
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,480
must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter

685
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,440
because of the rarity of deadly bee stings, my heart just leapt!

686

I've known from the very first book

687

that Misery had to be born of nobility

688

in case you hadn't noticed.

980
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,890
God told me, since I was his number-one fan,

981
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,440
that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon.

982
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,690
So I went to town, and I bought a typewriter,

983
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,900

984

It's right this way.

In that small cafe

1140
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:54,320
The park across the way

1141
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:02,170
The children's carousel

1142
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,420
The chestnut trees

1143
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:09,510
The wishin' well

1144
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:15,970
I'll be seeing you

1145
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:20,640
In every lovely summer's day

1146
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:27,690
In every thing that's light and gay

1147
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:34,490
I'll always think of you that way

1148
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:42,540
I'll find you In the morning sun

1149
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:47,960
And when the night is new

1150
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:53,260
I'll be looking at the moon

1151
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:57,970
But I'll be seeing you

1152
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,980
I'll be seeing you

1153
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:11,400
In every lovely summer's day

1154
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:16,360
I'll be seeing you in every thing that's light and gay

1155
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:21,790
I'll always think of you that way

1156
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:30,420
I'll find you In the morning sun

1157
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:35,510
And when the night is new

1158
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:43,890
I'll be looking at the moon

1159
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:50,650
But I'll be seeing you
