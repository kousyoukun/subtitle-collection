00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,839
- Hello, mummy!
- Hello, darling.

3
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,752
- Any presents for me?
- A surprise.

4
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:55,307
- What?
- You know!

5
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:59,373
- No I don't, what?
- Where is she? Did she miss tea again?

6
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:01,889
She said she had tummy-ache
so she's sulking in her room.

7
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,640
- It's her age.
- She's a pest!

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,032
So were you once!
Now go and wake her.

9
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:28,916
Pest, pest!

10
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,298
I want you to have a word with her.

11
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:36,689
Well, I have. I've tried...
I've been upstairs to see her...

12
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,842
- Yes, but not...
- She always tells me I don't understand her.

13
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:41,234
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Well, she's right.

14
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:08,141
Go away!

15
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,772
They want you downstairs!

16
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,034
You have to come out sometime,
you can't sulk in there forever!

17
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,295
Open the door!

18
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,361
Open it!

19
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:31,221
You've been at my lipstick too, haven't you!

20
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,559
Pest!

21
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,702
What makes you so different anyway!
Buck Teeth!

22
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,366
Come on out, pest!

23
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,953
It's not because I want you, either,
it's because Mummy wants you!

24
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,401
Pest, pest, pest!

25
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,670
Say goodbye to your sister now,
so you'll never forget her.

26
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:22,015
Stay with me, child.

27
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:26,453
Chew on this.
It'll keep your mind off things.

28
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:30,771
Man that is born of a woman

29
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,770
has but a short time to live
and is full of misery

30
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:37,968
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower

31
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,886
he fleeth as it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay.

32
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,324
In the midst of life we are in death.

33
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:51,883
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

34
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,841
to take on to himself the soul
of our dear sister here departed

35
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,440
we therefore commit her body to the ground

36
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,438
earth to earth

37
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:04,837
ashes to ashes

38
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,955
dust to dust

39
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:16,592
Your poor sister, all alone in the wood,
and nobody there to save her!

40
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,231
Poor little lamb!

41
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,390
Why couldn't she save herself?

42
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,789
You don't know these things,
you're only a child!

43
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:51,497
Daddy...

44
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:52,696
There, there, pet.

45
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,376
Shall I take her home with me tonight?

46
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,774
Her mother's in no fit state to look after her.

47
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,773
Come, pet.

48
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,093
I want to stay with Mummy.

49
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,412
Mummy's not well. Just for tonight.

50
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,811
Come, child, come with me.

51
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:13,447
It's a long way through the wood,
but safe by daylight.

52
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,165
Safe if you keep to the path...

53
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,961
There's lots more of these in the wood,

54
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,481
if you know where to look!

55
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:33,839
Berries!

56
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,517
Don't stray from the path, girl!

57
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,316
Did you not hear what I told you?

58
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:42,714
Once you stray from the path you're lost entirely!

59
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,793
The wild beasts know no mercy.

60
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,192
They wait for us in the wood, in the shadow,

61
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:51,112
and once you put a foot wrong

62
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:53,510
they POUNCE!

63
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,070
There, there, my precious.

64
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,869
Don't take on so.

65
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,308
It's something you have to learn,

66
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:00,707
otherwise you'll end up like your poor dear sister!

67
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,780
Granny, can I have one?

68
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,179
I can't see why not.

69
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:26,017
You've got a lot to learn, child.

70
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,735
Never stray from the path,
never eat a windfall apple...

71
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:33,213
and never trust a man whose eyebrows meet!

72
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:50,246
The best winter wool, pet, woven across the valley

73
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:54,804
so good, so soft I thought
I'd knit a shawl for your sister.

74
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:58,162
But now, you know what I'll do?

75
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,801
- What, Gran?
- I'll make one for you!

76
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:03,200
A very special shawl
for a very special lady.

77
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,478
Soft as a kitten.

78
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,236
There's something I should tell you.

79
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,394
Yes?

80
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,834
But maybe you're too young.

81
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,393
Tell me, Gran!

82
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,712
Too young to understand.

83
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:23,111
Oh, go on, Gran, tell me!

84
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:25,631
Maybe no child is ever too young.

85
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,709
A wolf may be more than he seems.

86
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,547
He may come in many disguises.

87
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,586
What's that?

88
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:37,985
The wolf that ate your sister
was hairy on the outside.

89
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:42,063
But when she died she went straight to Heaven.

90
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:45,182
The worst kind of wolves are hairy on the inside,

91
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:48,421
and when they bite you,
they drag you with them to Hell!

92
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,739
What do you mean, hairy on the inside?
Like a furry coat?

93
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,577
Hush now, foolish child, and listen.

94
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:01,136
Once upon a time
there was a Woman in the village,

95
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:05,694
and she married a travelling man...

96
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,829
They've all gone now.

97
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:04,348
It's a shame your people missed the wedding.

98
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,947
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.

99
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,936
My brother's idea of a joke!

100
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,210
Why are you staring like that?

101
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,888
Because I've never seen anything like you before.

102
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:56,406
Don't they have girls where you come from?

103
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:59,284
None like you.

104
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:25,074
Come out of the shadows.

105
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,953
Let me see you, my love.

106
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:38,268
Are all travelling men as handsome as you?

107
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,425
So you think I'm handsome?

108
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:48,224
The first thing I noticed about you

109
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,942
was the way your eyebrows meet.

110
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:54,820
Does that spoil me then?

111
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,779
Come to me and I'll tell you.

112
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,328
My dear?

113
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,886
I must just... go out into the yard for a moment...

114
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,525
Why ever for?

115
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:36,203
Call of nature.

116
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,515
So she waited...

117
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,913
and she waited...

118
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,312
and she waited again.

119
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:13,987
Surely he's been gone a long time?

120
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,453
No! It can't be!

121
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,448
He upped and ran, that's all.

122
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:58,848
It was in his blood.

123
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:01,487
Wasn't he a travelling man?

124
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,440
Anything?

125
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,600
Not a hair nor a hide of him.

126
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,999
Nor a footprint.

127
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,518
What's that, might I ask?

128
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,917
I told you I heard a wolf last night!

129
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,156
They came and took him
while he was making water,

130
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:30,034
when a man is at his most defenseless.

131
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:36,511
Murderers! They're murderers!

132
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:43,228
But she was a young thing

133
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,987
and cheerful of temperament

134
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,706
and she found another husband

135
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:52,224
not too shy to piss in a pot!

136
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,299
And they lived happily ever after!

137
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,338
Indeed they did not!

138
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:09,977
First time passed, happily enough.

139
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,574
What a mess!

140
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:20,293
Oh, don't start!

141
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,689
Shut up!

142
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,206
Here.

143
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,606
Time passed, and she gave him children.

144
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:39,364
And that was a bad time for wolves,
those years, oh yes!

145
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:43,442
Not a sheep or a cow was safe.

146
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,558
But for herself all went right as a trivet

147
00:21:56,877 --> 00:22:00,476
until... one winter's night...

148
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:12,444
My God...

149
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,357
I'm starving.

150
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,592
Do you want something to eat?

151
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:43,991
Didn't you hear me the first time!

152
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,219
Where did these three spring from?

153
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:14,098
Out of my belly!

154
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:16,497
Your children...
but not my children!

155
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,415
Whore!

156
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:23,214
Adulteress!

157
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:25,613
You hoped I'd never come back!

158
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:26,812
I thought the wolves had taken you!

159
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:29,092
Better a wolf than a whore!

160
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,490
If I were wolf once more,
I'd teach this whore a lesson!

161
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,982
He looks just the same...

162
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,019
as the day I married him!

163
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:33,811
I'd never let a man strike me.

164
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:36,211
Oh, they're nice as pie until
they've had their way with you.

165
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:39,089
But once the bloom is gone, oh,
the beast comes out.

166
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,007
When the wolves, though
when the real wolves...

167
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:47,486
when the real wolves mate,
do the dogs beat the bitches afterward?

168
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,084
Animals! All wild animals!

169
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,362
Well, that's enough wool for tonight.

170
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,241
Bedtime.

171
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:09,916
What about a kiss for Granny?

172
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:15,674
Don't I deserve a kiss for my story?

173
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:25,629
The best of all girls!

174
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:14,183
Of course you won't stay a young girl much longer.

175
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,901
Your mummy and daddy will need
all the help they can get.

176
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,900
Just grow wise, learn all that you can,
now that your sister is gone.

177
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,410
Caught!

178
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,809
Caught who, you snotty-nosed ragamuffin?

179
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:48,368
I caught Rosaleen!

180
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:50,767
Oh no, nobody catches my little princess!

181
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,485
Come along, my child.

182
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:25,193
There's too much food
now there's just the three of us.

183
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,951
Don't grieve.

184
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:30,590
Least said soonest mended.

185
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:03,576
Rosaleen!

186
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:08,614
Shall we play now?

187
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:09,933
Play what?

188
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:11,852
A game!

189
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:14,251
I know a good game.
Close your eyes.

190
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,330
Now, come to me.

191
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:21,928
Closer, closer.
Come on.

192
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:26,846
Closer.

193
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:30,685
There!

194
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:33,083
Now what?

195
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:35,722
Olly olly, can't catch me!

196
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:20,917
Mummy...

197
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,316
Yes, pet?

198
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:27,035
- Does he hurt you?
- Does who hurt me?

199
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:29,433
Does Daddy hurt you...
when he...

200
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:31,472
No, not at all.

201
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:32,792
It sounds like...

202
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,231
Like what?

203
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:36,631
Like the beasts Granny talked about.

204
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,989
You pay too much attention to your Granny.

205
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:44,546
She knows a lot, but she doesn't know everything.

206
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:48,985
And if there's a beast in men,
it meets its match in women too.

207
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,503
Understand me?

208
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,903
Get up and fetch me some water.

209
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:08,416
Rosaleen!

210
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,336
Yes?

211
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:12,734
I've brought you a little present.

212
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:15,254
What kind of present?

213
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,611
I thought maybe you'd take
a walk with me in the wood,

214
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,130
on Sunday after the service.

215
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,649
Just a little walk, Rosaleen.

216
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,168
Why should I?

217
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,567
I thought maybe you'd want to.

218
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:35,525
I'd have to ask.

219
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:38,043
Tell your mother I'll be with you.

220
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:41,642
And we won't stray from the path!

221
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:53,157
They're the best of all roses...
fit for the grave of a princess.

222
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:56,276
They came off my best rose tree!

223
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,395
Why can't Mommy grow roses like that?

224
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:03,713
It's a question of a green thumb, she lacks that.
No hand at pastry, either!

225
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:05,272
Good morning, Father!

226
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:07,672
Good morning!

227
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:12,709
They say that priests' bastards often turn
into wolves as they grow older!

228
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:15,228
What do you mean?

229
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:17,507
If the child is born on Christmas Day.

230
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,066
If he's born feet first he'll be the one,

231
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:21,465
if he's born feet first
and his eyebrows meet in the middle!

232
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:24,944
Oh yes... very bad!

233
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:28,782
One day he'll meet
the Devil in the wood...

234
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:02,342
Now use it wisely!

235
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:06,061
Waste not, want not!

236
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,911
No! No!

237
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:28,465
That's a horrid story!
I didn't like it at all.

238
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:32,424
It's not a story, child, but God's own truth.

239
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:38,660
So if you should spy on a naked man in the wood,
run as if the Devil himself were after you!

240
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,898
The Devil's one thing,
but a priest making babies is another!

241
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:46,577
I don't think our priest would have it in him.

242
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,775
You can't trust anyone, least of all a priest!
He's not called Father for nothing!

243
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,134
And don't bother to whisper,
he's deaf as a post!

244
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:58,332
There, isn't that lovely?

245
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:02,651
All we need is a nice border and fringe.
See how soft it feels!

246
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,408
Soft as snow!

247
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,687
Red as a berry!

248
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:13,086
Red as blood.

249
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:18,123
Old fool, want to brain me!
What's he up to in the tree, the old monkey!

250
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:24,481
Father, are you climbing up to Heaven
and chopping the rungs of the ladder after you?

251
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:25,680
Watch what you're doing!

252
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Can you hear me?

253
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,599
Don't make so much clamour in the garden
of God's house, you irreverent old woman!

254
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:32,638
- I heard every word!
- Well, what a silly game!

255
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,036
Someone's got to do it!
Someone's got to cut away the old wood.

256
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:38,514
Even evergreens need pruning!

257
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,819
Daddy, leave her be!

258
00:41:18,697 --> 00:41:21,097
He only asked me to walk with him.

259
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,496
- What's wrong with that?
- All the same, I don't know. It's not as if...

260
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,775
Ah, where's the harm in it,
he's our neighbour's son,

261
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,174
she's known him since she was a baby.
She still is a baby.

262
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:32,252
- So was our Alice once.
- She'll be gone soon enough, she's so pretty.

263
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:35,371
What is it they say,
it's not losing a daughter, it's gaining a son?

264
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,249
Stop teasing me,
he only asked me to walk with him!

265
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:40,648
Well, one thing leads to another.

266
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:21,671
Isaiah, Chapter 11, Verses 6 to 8

267
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:25,868
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,

268
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,947
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;

269
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:34,145
and the calf and the young lion
and the fatling together;

270
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,743
and a little child shall lead them.

271
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,954
And the cow and the bear shall feed;

272
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:44,944
their young ones shall lie down together:

273
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:50,086
and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

274
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:55,826
And the sucking child shall
play on the hole of the asp,

275
00:42:57,022 --> 00:43:01,088
and the weaned child shall
put his hand on the cockatrice ' den.

276
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:07,546
They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy mountain:

277
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:11,014
for the earth shall be full
of the knowledge of the LORD,

278
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:14,243
as the waters cover the sea.

279
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:21,777
That's my boy!

280
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:27,876
Don't stray from the path!

281
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,203
- When do you have to be back, Rosaleen?
- Soon.

282
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:42,944
Why are you so crabby today?
I thought you wanted to come!

283
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:45,694
So what if I did?

284
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:49,760
Well, you should...

285
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,271
What should I?

286
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:01,958
- Well, you know...
- I don't know.

287
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:04,230
Look!

288
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,721
Pretty, but not as pretty as you!

289
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,342
- Wasn't that nice?
- No.

290
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:38,313
What's wrong, Rosaleen?
Don't you like me?

291
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:41,781
Oh no, I like you.
I like you well enough.

292
00:44:43,575 --> 00:44:45,966
Well why won't you kiss me?

293
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:51,228
You're afraid, aren't you?

294
00:44:51,228 --> 00:44:52,663
I'm not afraid!

295
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:57,686
Well?

296
00:45:04,024 --> 00:45:06,057
That wasn't very good.

297
00:45:06,057 --> 00:45:09,645
- Give me another!
- Have to catch me first!

298
00:45:16,102 --> 00:45:18,494
Rosaleen!

299
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,684
Where are you?

300
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,990
Oh Jesus!

301
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:57,999
Wolf! Wolf!

302
00:48:19,818 --> 00:48:22,216
Wolf...!

303
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:25,933
Where's my daughter?
What have you done with my daughter?

304
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:28,330
She ran away from me!

305
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,848
- Get your hands off him!
- Rosaleen!

306
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:33,246
Don't you hit my boy!

307
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:37,202
Your son left my only daughter
to the mercy of the wolves!

308
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:40,439
A daughter's one thing,
a heifer's another!

309
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:57,224
I'll cool you off!

310
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:04,777
My darling! Where have you been?

311
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:08,133
And in such a state!

312
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:10,771
Look, Mummy.

313
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:34,629
Take care, won't you?
And take this.

314
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:38,585
No. This is all these beasts understand.
Kill them before they kill you.

315
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:53,091
Keep close!

316
00:49:59,805 --> 00:50:02,802
There was once a village
so plagued by the beasts

317
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,039
they drew one up in the bucket of the well!

318
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,797
Hush your antique gossip
unless you want the wolves to hear it!

319
00:50:18,628 --> 00:50:21,745
You're such a big girl now, aren't you?
Come on, hold still!

320
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:24,502
There you are, big girl!

321
00:50:24,502 --> 00:50:27,020
Just be careful of those boys
if they take you in the wood again.

322
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,538
What boys?
Clowns are what the village boys are!

323
00:50:29,657 --> 00:50:32,055
Your Granny spoils you...
makes you think you're something special.

324
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:35,652
That red shawl!

325
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,687
If you think the wolves are big now
you should have seen them when I were a lad!

326
00:50:41,526 --> 00:50:43,924
Monsters they was...
that's the truth!

327
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:48,120
Veritable monsters.

328
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,117
Big as a man...bigger!

329
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,510
When will Daddy have done with the killing?

330
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:04,185
When the beast is dead,
and not until the beast is dead.

331
00:51:05,264 --> 00:51:07,662
We won't live quiet until then.

332
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,166
Be winter soon.

333
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,403
Hard winter. A hard winter brings out the wolves.

334
00:51:29,482 --> 00:51:31,879
Thank God we're safe indoors!

335
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,233
We must hide in the trees!

336
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,909
BOY! Quickly!

337
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:48,424
Douse the lights!

338
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:52,980
Into the trees! Quietly!

339
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:13,361
Granny says wolves may not
always be what they seem.

340
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,718
How can a wolf be worse
than it already is?

341
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:19,715
Not worse, but different.
Maybe it isn't the wolf's fault, Mummy.

342
00:52:21,993 --> 00:52:23,671
Maybe...

343
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:25,469
Maybe what?

344
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:27,867
Maybe once upon a time...

345
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:29,546
Are you going to tell me a story?

346
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,864
Maybe I am.

347
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:32,663
Go on then !

348
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:36,379
Once upon a time...
there was a Woman in the valley.

349
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:40,935
And the son of the big house
did her a terrible wrong.

350
00:52:41,894 --> 00:52:44,532
So she came to his wedding,
to put wrong to right.

351
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,460
My dear, she was a beautiful thing.
No one would have suspected a thing.

352
00:53:43,996 --> 00:53:46,634
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

353
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:50,830
- To the bride ...and groom!
- To the bride and groom!

354
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:55,026
Come on, lad, kiss the girl!

355
00:53:57,544 --> 00:53:59,102
With pleasure!

356
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,778
A taste of what's to come!

357
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:20,203
Well done, sir! Very good!

358
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:26,261
So, I wasn't good enough for you.

359
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,975
I was, once...

360
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,048
Once upon a time...

361
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,358
Don't you remember?

362
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:58,990
Don't you?

363
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,017
The wolves in the forest are more decent!

364
00:56:33,278 --> 00:56:35,317
Absolutely horrible!

365
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,456
Where did you hear a story like that?

366
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:25,854
It's not a story, but God's honest truth!

367
00:58:26,573 --> 00:58:27,892
Granny told me.

368
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:31,129
And after that, the Woman made the wolves
come to sing to her and the baby at night.

369
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:33,526
Made them come and serenade her.

370
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:36,044
But what pleasure could there be in that?
Listening to a lot of wolves!

371
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,801
Don't we have to do it all the time?

372
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,600
The pleasure would come...

373
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,477
...from knowing the power that she had.

374
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,438
Daddy, the wolf!

375
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,117
Praise be to God!

376
01:00:23,714 --> 01:00:27,430
When I cut it off the carcass
for a trophy, it was the forepaw...

377
01:00:30,068 --> 01:00:33,545
the forepaw of the biggest
wolf I ever saw.

378
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,943
The wolf that killed our Alice?

379
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,060
Aye, may be.

380
01:00:40,618 --> 01:00:44,335
When I cut it with the knife
it was a forepaw, I swear,

381
01:00:45,534 --> 01:00:47,931
of a grizzle giant wolf...

382
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,048
and then before my very eyes...

383
01:00:53,446 --> 01:00:56,084
Whose is it, Daddy?
Is it someone you knew?

384
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:58,961
What do I know whose hand it is!
All I know is what I see.

385
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:00,400
Get it out!

386
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,678
Was it a man or a wolf you killed?

387
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:06,034
When I killed it it was a wolf,

388
01:01:06,034 --> 01:01:08,432
and it turned into a man.
Seeing is believing.

389
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:12,988
Is it? What about... touching?

390
01:01:15,386 --> 01:01:16,585
Get it out!

391
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:21,860
Whatever it is,
now it's dead meat!

392
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:24,857
Do we bury it or burn it, Daddy?

393
01:02:43,983 --> 01:02:47,460
You're besotted with that old lady,
and her old wives' tales.

394
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,097
Maybe you shouldn't go.

395
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:52,495
Daddy killed the great wolf.
I'll be safe in the forest now, Mummy.

396
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:55,373
Mind you don't stray,
and take something to protect yourself with.

397
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,645
How about a knife?

398
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:08,560
You're not afraid of anything, are you?

399
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,198
You're a fearless child,
I'll say that.

400
01:03:11,797 --> 01:03:14,195
I suppose your Granny
will ask you to stay the night.

401
01:03:14,914 --> 01:03:15,993
You always were her favorite.

402
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:18,391
Of course I'll stay the night if she asks me
it'd be rude not to.

403
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:22,108
She is my grandmother,
and she may not have a kind word for you,

404
01:03:22,108 --> 01:03:24,026
but she's always been good to me.

405
01:03:24,026 --> 01:03:26,424
She's all alone out there, Mummy.

406
01:03:26,293 --> 01:03:29,890
Maybe you're right and maybe you're not.
Give her that from me.

407
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,767
And don't stray now, Rosaleen!
I trust you.

408
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:35,765
- You won't be lucky twice.
- I promise.

409
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:18,575
Rosaleen!

410
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:21,452
Where are you going?

411
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,131
To see my Granny.

412
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,128
It's a long ways through the woods!
Let me come with you

413
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,087
you'd be safe with me!

414
01:04:27,087 --> 01:04:29,485
Go into the woods with you?
After what happened last time?

415
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:32,362
Let me come, I'll protect you!

416
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:35,239
No. I've got this to protect me.

417
01:05:22,715 --> 01:05:24,274
Miss?

418
01:05:24,993 --> 01:05:26,791
Where did you spring from?

419
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:29,189
Did I scare you?
I am sorry.

420
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:31,107
At least you have your clothes on.

421
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:35,783
Huntsman, are you? Lost your horse?

422
01:05:37,342 --> 01:05:40,698
Lost my horse and lost
my companions, young lady.

423
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:44,055
And lost your way too.

424
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:49,211
I do believe I just found it.

425
01:05:52,088 --> 01:05:54,725
I say, do you think you could
spare me a drink out of that?

426
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,603
It's for my Granny.

427
01:05:59,881 --> 01:06:03,118
I know the very place up the way for a picnic!

428
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,499
I have the most remarkable object in my pocket.

429
01:06:25,057 --> 01:06:27,934
That means I never lose my way in the woods.

430
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:30,332
In your pocket, you say?

431
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:33,449
This object goes everywhere with me

432
01:06:36,087 --> 01:06:38,485
that is, whenever I wear my trousers.

433
01:06:47,476 --> 01:06:49,514
Go on, bite it.

434
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:05,819
Don't you know how strong that stuff is?

435
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,056
A man in our village keeps a still...
he's the reddest nose you ever saw.

436
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:14,691
He tells lies, too.
Like you.

437
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,168
I don't believe there is such a thing.

438
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:22,484
Seeing is believing.

439
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:33,753
The little needle always points north,
no matter where I go,

440
01:07:34,952 --> 01:07:37,350
so I always know exactly where I am.

441
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:44,183
I don't believe it, even though I see it.

442
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,420
It was this compass that brought me
safe through the wood.

443
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,777
But you lost your way in the wood.

444
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:54,853
But I found you.

445
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:58,210
Are you sorry?

446
01:07:59,649 --> 01:08:02,526
I'm not sorry.
They're clowns, the village boys.

447
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,325
Well, then.

448
01:08:04,325 --> 01:08:06,483
But don't you know you should
never leave the path?

449
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:09,360
I just got onto the path.
I was perfectly safe before.

450
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:12,357
Aren't you afraid of the wolves?

451
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:16,793
Why should I be frightened of wolves?

452
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:20,030
You must know the worse wolves
are hairy on the inside.

453
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,147
Old wives' tales! Peasant superstition!

454
01:08:23,387 --> 01:08:26,504
What, a bright young girl...
pretty, intelligent girl like you

455
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:28,182
believing in werewolves!

456
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,861
But my Granny said that...

457
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:34,177
For believing in old wives' tales,

458
01:08:35,615 --> 01:08:37,174
you...

459
01:08:39,212 --> 01:08:41,610
deserve...

460
01:08:43,768 --> 01:08:46,166
to be...

461
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:49,522
punished!

462
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:58,514
I'll show you I'm not afraid
of the wolves, Rosaleen.

463
01:09:00,312 --> 01:09:01,871
I'll make a bet with you.

464
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,187
I'll bet you anything you like that I get
to your Granny's house before you do.

465
01:09:06,187 --> 01:09:07,026
How?

466
01:09:08,465 --> 01:09:09,903
Because...

467
01:09:09,903 --> 01:09:12,301
I'll use my compass to help me cross the country

468
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,898
while you trudge along the dreary path!

469
01:09:17,816 --> 01:09:19,375
Bet me your compass.

470
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:25,609
Bet me your heart's desire.

471
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:28,726
And if I lose?

472
01:09:28,726 --> 01:09:31,124
You can...

473
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,679
give me...

474
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:38,916
a kiss!

475
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:46,349
Here! take my hat as a token of good will.

476
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:48,987
Wear it, until we meet again.

477
01:11:09,672 --> 01:11:10,631
Who is it?

478
01:11:10,631 --> 01:11:12,070
Only your granddaughter.

479
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,426
Lift up the latch and walk in.

480
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:22,260
God save us!

481
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,173
Get you back to Hell from which you came!

482
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:32,810
I don't come from Hell. I came from the forest.

483
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,489
What have you done with my granddaughter?

484
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:37,246
Nothing she didn't want!

485
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:21,549
Who's there?

486
01:13:21,549 --> 01:13:22,748
Only your granddaughter.

487
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:25,625
Lift up the latch and walk in.

488
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:31,140
So. You got here before me
just as you said you would.

489
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:33,418
I did.

490
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:35,816
Where's my Granny?

491
01:13:35,816 --> 01:13:38,573
Gone out to the woodpile, to fetch more logs.

492
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:41,091
A real gentleman would never
let an old lady go out,

493
01:13:41,091 --> 01:13:42,170
not on a night like this.

494
01:13:42,769 --> 01:13:45,287
She won't be long.

495
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:53,319
She's not there.

496
01:14:12,142 --> 01:14:14,180
Is that all you left of her?

497
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:16,937
Your kind can't stomach
hair, can you

498
01:14:17,177 --> 01:14:19,575
even if the worst wolves
are hairy on the inside!

499
01:14:19,575 --> 01:14:21,253
What do you know about my kind?

500
01:14:21,253 --> 01:14:23,651
My Granny told me plenty!

501
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,885
Are you very much afraid?

502
01:14:29,885 --> 01:14:32,283
It wouldn't do me much good
to be afraid, would it?

503
01:14:33,842 --> 01:14:35,999
What big eyes you have!

504
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:37,798
All the better to see you with.

505
01:14:37,918 --> 01:14:40,555
They say seeing is believing,
but I'd never swear to it.

506
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,351
You must be wet through.

507
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:48,828
Why don't you take off your shawl?

508
01:15:09,448 --> 01:15:10,767
What should I do with it?

509
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:12,925
Into the fire,
you won't need it again.

510
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,434
Your kind can't stomach clothes either.

511
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:32,227
Who's come to sing us carols then?

512
01:15:32,467 --> 01:15:34,625
Only my companions, darling.

513
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:37,023
I love the company of wolves.

514
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:39,540
Look out of the window and you'll see them.

515
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,412
Poor creatures.
It's freezing cold out there,

516
01:15:49,851 --> 01:15:51,409
no wonder they howl so.

517
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:02,559
- Are you sorry for them?
- Yes. And for you too!

518
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,995
You're a bold fearless girl, aren't you?

519
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:09,632
And now you must give me back
my gun, my dear.

520
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:35,288
Are you our kind, or their kind?

521
01:16:37,207 --> 01:16:39,604
Not one kind or the other. Both.

522
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:43,081
Then where do you live?
In our world, or in theirs?

523
01:16:44,759 --> 01:16:48,356
I come and go between them.
My home is nowhere.

524
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:53,871
Are you only a man
when you dress that way

525
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:56,389
like Granny said?

526
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:10,416
My, what big arms you have.

527
01:17:11,255 --> 01:17:14,372
All the better to hug you with.

528
01:17:24,562 --> 01:17:26,121
Well...

529
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,639
perhaps...

530
01:17:29,598 --> 01:17:31,756
you did win your bet, didn't you

531
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:34,513
you gentleman, you fine gentleman.

532
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:38,469
They say the Prince of Darkness
is a gentleman.

533
01:17:40,148 --> 01:17:42,546
And as it turns out, they're right:
A fine gentleman.

534
01:17:44,104 --> 01:17:46,502
Gentlemen always keep their promises.

535
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:49,859
Do ladies keep their promises?

536
01:17:50,818 --> 01:17:53,575
Indeed I won my bet. So now,

537
01:17:54,415 --> 01:17:55,613
you owe me...

538
01:17:56,692 --> 01:17:58,491
I remember.

539
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:01,248
...a kiss.

540
01:18:01,488 --> 01:18:04,006
Will you be honourable and pay me,

541
01:18:04,006 --> 01:18:06,763
or not?

542
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:27,983
Jesus, what big teeth you have!

543
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,138
All the better to eat you with.

544
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:58,499
I'm sorry.

545
01:20:05,932 --> 01:20:08,450
I never knew a wolf could cry.

546
01:20:21,038 --> 01:20:23,915
Leaving you, are they?
You'll be all alone.

547
01:20:25,594 --> 01:20:29,310
I'll tell you a story of a wounded wolf...

548
01:20:39,141 --> 01:20:41,659
Once upon a time...

549
01:20:41,659 --> 01:20:44,056
...when the village was asleep...

550
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,054
...a she-wolf came,

551
01:20:47,773 --> 01:20:49,691
from the world below

552
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:53,288
to the world above.

553
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:11,391
She meant no harm...

554
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:13,909
...to anyone,

555
01:21:14,628 --> 01:21:17,026
but someone meant harm to her.

556
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,897
So she ran... and she ran...

557
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:30,213
...and she ran again...

558
01:21:48,317 --> 01:21:50,235
Who's there?

559
01:22:15,052 --> 01:22:17,569
This is holy ground!

560
01:22:23,923 --> 01:22:26,681
Can you speak, my child?

561
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:34,114
Are you God's work, or the Devil's?

562
01:22:36,512 --> 01:22:39,509
Oh, what do I care whose work you are...

563
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:42,866
...you poor, speechless creature?

564
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,217
It will heal... in time.

565
01:22:57,732 --> 01:22:59,890
And the wound did heal...

566
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:03,367
...for she was just a girl after all...

567
01:23:03,606 --> 01:23:06,244
...who had strayed from the path in the forest...

568
01:23:07,323 --> 01:23:09,960
...and remembered what she'd found there.

569
01:23:49,284 --> 01:23:52,281
So back through the forest

570
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,837
she ran and ran...

571
01:24:19,256 --> 01:24:22,613
...to the well, and the village,

572
01:24:23,452 --> 01:24:25,850
from whence she came...

573
01:24:44,432 --> 01:24:50,547
She crept inside, to the world below ...

574
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:59,059
And that's all I'll tell you,

575
01:25:00,258 --> 01:25:03,375
because that's all I know.

576
01:25:12,476 --> 01:25:14,154
Rosaleen!

577
01:25:57,914 --> 01:25:59,472
No!

578
01:26:03,668 --> 01:26:06,066
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

579
01:26:06,306 --> 01:26:09,303
Rosaleen!

580
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:15,905
Little girls, this seems to say:

581
01:28:16,504 --> 01:28:19,142
Never stop upon your way;

582
01:28:19,981 --> 01:28:22,379
Never trust a stranger friend

583
01:28:23,338 --> 01:28:25,736
No one knows how it will end.

584
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:29,692
As you're pretty, so be wise

585
01:28:30,771 --> 01:28:33,529
Wolves may lurk in every guise

586
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:39,163
Now, as then, 'tis simple truth:

587
01:28:40,602 --> 01:28:44,798
Sweetest tongue hides sharpest tooth.
