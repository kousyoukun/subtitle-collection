1
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:26,156
Cool boy playin'.

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,507
Fat man runnin'.

3
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,641
Old fool walkin'.

4
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:36,166
Dead man coughin'.

5
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,648
Cool boy playin'.

6
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:45,088
Fat man runnin' Old fool
walkin'.

7
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,047
Dead man coughin'.

8
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,110
This is the best goddamn show.

9
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:12,724
Oh, my ass is on fire.

10
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,774
That shit is not healthy.

11
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,215
This is the best goddamn show.

12
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,614
I shit you not, .

13
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:35,138
There's nothing funnier than a
good ass joke.

14
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,358
Just ask my brats.

15
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:42,319
You know what's funny is,
you've been here for two hours.

16
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,107
Getting a bad feeling here.

17
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:54,114
Just relax, kid.

18
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,681
Hey, hey, check this out.

19
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,292
See that fat kid?

20
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,162
Looks like a big fat--

21
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,600
Chinese dragon
delivery.

22
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:03,558
Y'all order some food?

23
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,625
Oh, that's a beautiful thing
fellas.

24
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,110
Ooh.

25
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,554
Shh.

26
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,694
Now, let's see what your fortune
say.

27
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,442
Oops.

28
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,662
You scratched on the 8-ball,
son.

29
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,198
12:30 westbound, New
Orleans to Houston,

30
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,634
platform six.

31
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,027
12:30 westbound--

32
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,444
Ask any kid
where to find a monster.

33
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,447
They'll tell you to look under
the bed.

34
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:48,146
But sometimes, when the bed
ain't big enough to hold

35
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,107
those bad motherfuckers?

36
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,891
You got no choice but to get
away.

37
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,259
At first, it's all a giggle.

38
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,261
Then you realize hitting the
road's

39
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:20,788
like hitting the index, end of
fucking story,

40
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,879
unless you discover you have a
talent.

41
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,316
Then, you become a hustler.

42
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,814
Name's Nine Ball, kid.

43
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,859
You know it?

44
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:49,817
You can break.

45
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,822
Hablo Americano?

46
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,612
Nine ball,
simple game.

47
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:03,526
Sink the nine.

48
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,963
Win the game.

49
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:11,578
Trick was, you had to sink eight
other balls in order first.

50
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:15,407
Unless you got lucky and dropped
the nine with one of them.

51
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,845
But there was no such thing as
luck to a hustler.

52
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,245
Luck was what the other guy
wanted.

53
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,597
Pretty mean break.

54
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,598
Run it back.

55
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:43,000
What a
hustler wanted was a mark who

56
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,786
couldn't tell luck from skill.

57
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,745
That's what made a pool player
into a hustler.

58
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,685
Look at that kid.

59
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,425
We ain't get that snake bite
screw.

60
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,649
Jesus.

61
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,477
Nah.

62
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,913
He just break like Jesus.

63
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,701
Yeah.

64
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,616
He look like he need to be
using a lighter stick.

65
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,189
You shoot like a cat called
Tenderloin

66
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,713
Tony from San Francisco.

67
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:34,024
Beat me like a red-headed
stepchild once.

68
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,505
He stuffed my stake horse, Cue
Ball Carl.

69
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,029
Phew, royally.

70
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,683
All the bread he took offa him?

71
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:48,082
Tough titty, little man. Step on
back.

72
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,574
Bring it up, 100?

73
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,229
I got somethin' for ya.

74
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:07,144
Like what?

75
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,411
Tally that up.

76
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,369
OK.

77
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,724
Worm's turned.

78
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,509
You're done shittin' out.

79
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,729
Your momma tell you about
throwing money at people?

80
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,128
Sorry.

81
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,747
You finally got him in the
electric chair?

82
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,575
My turn to run.

83
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:47,707
We brought it up on that last
one.

84
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,925
We at a Cecil a game now!

85
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,193
What?

86
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,804
You think he doin' business on
me?

87
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,678
Come on Carl, look at him.

88
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:10,164
I mean, all right, he can shoot
straight,

89
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:13,820
but Carl, man, I'm your player,
man.

90
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:25,440
Then go play, and get 100
nickels.

91
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,309
You played me this whole
fucking time?

92
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:56,487
Tough titty, little man.

93
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,620
By the way, my name's Jericho.

94
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,886
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

95
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,323
Bring your fat mother fuckin'
ass over here.

96
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,941
Welcome to the tribe, son.

97
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,290
Motherfucker.

98
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,813
[INAUDIBLE] bitch ass here.

99
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,472
Her name
was Jezebel Black.

100
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,910
Two scoops of ice cream on a hot
summer night.

101
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:31,087
Carl used her to line up the
marks.

102
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,219
They used us to cut 'em up.

103
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,535
'Sup sweetie?

104
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,625
OK Jenna, no bullshit.

105
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:48,844
For real.

106
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,674
Am I the unluckiest fucking girl
you know.

107
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:53,893
You know you fierce, Jez.

108
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:57,897
You think I'm fierece?

109
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,121
How much you in for?

110
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,862
Too large.

111
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,472
Come on, please?

112
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,386
A Cecil.

113
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,735
I'm good for it.

114
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,651
Sweetie, you into Case two
grand, and you're

115
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:16,654
sitting here asking me for a s

116
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,266
Listen, I just need enough to
get me started

117
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:22,138
on a riverboat game, please.

118
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,661
Tell him what happened.

119
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,663
I was up three grand.

120
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,891
I was sitting on a run to the 8,
right?

121
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,719
Punched my nuts straight.

122
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,028
Let me guess?

123
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:42,942
What?

124
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,334
You pushed it all in?

125
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,641
Join your wad, baby.

126
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:47,555
Just one problem.

127
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,644
Always is.

128
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,951
I was shy of the pot by two
fucking g's.

129
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:56,956
So you borrowed it from case?

130
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,913
Exactly.

131
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,616
I couldn't lose.

132
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,358
That Albino jackrabbit was
probably making business on you

133
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,926
with his Filipino friend.

134
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,016
Only where he thinks he can keep
a leash on your pussy.

135
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,801
I didn't know somebody was
packing three fucking bullets.

136
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,335
How'd you get out of there,
girl?

137
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,467
Well, International Ted was
there,

138
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:36,473
so I told him that he could play
with my titties

139
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:40,173
if he loaned me the scratch.

140
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,304
Just one fucking problem.

141
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,350
It turns out to be that the guy
is gay.

142
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,047
Oh.

143
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,788
All right.

144
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,009
So I had to get the hell out of
there, immediately.

145
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,706
Muy pronto. - Shit, Jez.

146
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,799
OK, I'll give you the two
hundred.

147
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,936
You better not be playing me
neither.

148
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,115
I love you mama.

149
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,072
Mm-hmm.

150
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:19,255
You belong
to Carl's tribe.

151
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,300
You're worried about nothing.

152
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:28,612
I'm gonna call this
place the shooting gallery.

153
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:34,836
I like that, my own private
fishing hole.

154
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:38,361
Only two kinds of action we're
gonna run, here.

155
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:42,670
A long frame, and a short con.

156
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:46,108
Long frame for taking in the big
skull.

157
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:49,329
So let few play their part.

158
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,767
Don't lie can make that call.

159
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,117
He'll understand.

160
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,727
Y'all stick to working the short
con,

161
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:59,600
you know, playing the tables.

162
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,168
Let it come to you.

163
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:09,088
And remember, be here for the
dough, not to shoot.

164
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,654
All you had
to do was earn.

165
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:14,441
Sometimes, that meant violence.

166
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:15,529
C'mon man, I'm just a cook!

167
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:16,660
Mad boy was
what

168
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,314
we called the lucky Pierre.

169
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:21,665
He had no game, so he never got
the choice end of the score,

170
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,015
but he always took the fall with
the blue trap shut.

171
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,974
I don't have your money!

172
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,410
I don't have your money!

173
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,369
You don't have my what?

174
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,022
Fuck you!

175
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,155
Paul The
Pawn was off his fucking nut.

176
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,157
He was also Carl's number one
player.

177
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,115
It used to be Nichols.

178
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,206
Nichols got turned out.

179
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:44,166
His team got kicked in,
remember?

180
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,124
Fuck you!

181
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,037
Get--

182
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:49,302
So, uh, he owes Paul how much?

183
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:06,536
Me, I was
different from those fools.

184
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,191
I was a hustler, sure, but I had
a goal.

185
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,979
And a hustler with a goal ended
up one of two ways.

186
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,373
Happy--

187
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,331
Chicago.

188
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,854
Or dead.

189
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,203
No, Boston.

190
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,424
What the fuck is this, a
geography lesson?

191
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,338
This is bullshit.

192
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,515
I need some play .

193
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,734
Cue Ball
Carl Bridgers.

194
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:34,782
He was one of the best nine ball
players ever.

195
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:38,960
Now, he was just a stake horse.

196
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,048
You know, you never let a twist

197
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,832
get between you and the tribe.

198
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,705
You know what I mean?

199
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,054
Yeah?

200
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,838
Do you like arita?

201
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,449
Because I love arita.

202
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,585
The
shooting gallery.

203
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:58,414
Carl's own private fishing hole.

204
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,155
He sunk everything he had into
it.

205
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:08,816
At the end of the day, he took
70% of whatever we made.

206
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,035
Snap it.

207
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,124
One of the
things Carl taught us--

208
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,388
never underestimate the
stupidity

209
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:16,519
of the general public.

210
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:26,834
And never show your speed until
the mark gave you

211
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:28,227
what you wanted.

212
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,794
If I don't have bad luck, I
have no luck at all.

213
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,231
Fuck it, I'm done.

214
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,145
You got me sown tighter than a
bull's ass tonight.

215
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,451
Ey, one more.

216
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,279
I'll give you the five and the
break, c'mon.

217
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,368
But uh, it's 20 a game.

218
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,804
Like an
Orange Crush--

219
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,763
the five and the break.

220
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:47,942
Wow, I have to be stupid not to
take that spot, uh?

221
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:48,899
20 a game.

222
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,225
Can you fucking believe that?

223
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,445
I never shot stick--

224
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,708
come on, you gotta admit that's
a hell of a shot.

225
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,536
Run it back.

226
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,624
Fuck that, man.

227
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,581
I quit.

228
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:26,807
Fuck.

229
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:35,206
[INAUDIBLE] gettin' you a
regular pay day.

230
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,383
You've been in dead stroke for
weeks now.

231
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,949
You know what I say Carl?

232
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,038
Give him a stick and he'll be as
cool as cool

233
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,519
as the other side of the pillow.

234
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:44,955
I'm playin' OK.

235
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,261
W you say, son.

236
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,131
OK.

237
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,219
I'm going to bounce.

238
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,178
So, you guys can talk.

239
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,141
See you later, .

240
00:21:57,185 --> 00:22:01,015
That's some dangerous pussy,
son.

241
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,321
You smell it?

242
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:11,417
[INAUDIBLE] telling me that she
hear

243
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,680
about an ace nine baller coming
into town

244
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,726
by the name of Tenderloin Tony.

245
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,686
Now I've got me some history
with this fool.

246
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:22,341
In this town, he's supposed to
be back by Rockefeller

247
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,473
[INAUDIBLE] wantin' to play
high,

248
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:28,390
so I want to run a long cream on
him.

249
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,871
No nine ball on this one.

250
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:33,961
Consider yourself my player.

251
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,397
Moving up
in the tribe

252
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,661
was like hitting the jackpot on
your birthday.

253
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:41,098
Nevermind Paul?

254
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,361
Paul's having some problems.

255
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,671
He's strictly front room from
now on.

256
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,418
It also
meant someone else

257
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,680
was going to be moving down.

258
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,641
Detective
expressed his frustration

259
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:05,514
that the grand jury had failed
to hand out any indictments.

260
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,908
The city with the number one
murder rate in the nation.

261
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,650
The savagery of the triple
homicide involving three

262
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,827
undercover NOPD detectives is
remembered as one

263
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,176
of the most brutal slayings.

264
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:25,795
Hiya, Bambi.

265
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,104
They call me thumper.

266
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,548
Thanks for talking me up,
making me look good to Carl.

267
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,552
So Carl made you his player
huh?

268
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,206
Um, yes.

269
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,947
Thanks to you.

270
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,470
Thanks to me, right?

271
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:55,216
So, I was thinking maybe--

272
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,174
Yeah?

273
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:00,047
Listen, I landed this stake
horse the other night,

274
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,571
and he told me that if I could
get him a player,

275
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:05,356
he was going to give me a
finder's fee.

276
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,793
I need the money.

277
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:07,968
So please?

278
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:13,539
OK.

279
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,453
Wait, Jez.

280
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,107
Come on.

281
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:23,723
I can help you but if Carl finds
me freelancing, I'm fucked.

282
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,637
You know that.

283
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,768
He won't.

284
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:26,813
I promise.

285
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,038
So where'd you meet him?

286
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,366
Um, we can make a little money
while we wait.

287
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,323
All right!

288
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,157
Hi.

289
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,158
How are ya?

290
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm good, how are you?

291
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,422
I'm doing better.

292
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,161
Who showed
your ass in a pool ball.

293
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,118
You lost your stake.

294
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,128
And when I played with Jags, I
had fun.

295
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,695
I just did.

296
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,219
The hard part was not letting it
show.

297
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:16,286
Fuckin' hustler dog?

298
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,072
Nah, everyone has their
moments.

299
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,073
That's what I thought.

300
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:21,857
He is part of a crew.

301
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:25,121
Woah, woah, easy, easy.

302
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,994
You watch your fucking back.

303
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,169
Hey, how are you guys doing?

304
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:30,431
Sorry, I got hung up. - You're
late.

305
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,301
We're leaving.

306
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,912
Where are you going?

307
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,915
You know if he leaves, you don't
get your finder's fee.

308
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,220
You any good, kid?

309
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:39,440
It's going to cost you to find
out, all right?

310
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:42,269
So that was him huh?

311
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,099
We made money.

312
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,143
Glad we didn't make a deal with
the stakers,

313
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:48,057
because I .

314
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,538
Hey kid, I saw your tat.

315
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:54,411
That means you belong to Carl
Bridgers right?

316
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:58,720
Where are you on your way to,
Shooting Gallery?

317
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,809
What if I told you I was staking
in a rogue player

318
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,464
from San Francisco looking to
play high.

319
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:06,249
What do you say?

320
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,425
Coincidence.

321
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:13,039
Carl called it God's way of
remaining anonymous.

322
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,084
Got a name.

323
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,216
Fuck you.

324
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,173
Asshole.

325
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:21,700
Go around, fuckhead.

326
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,318
Yeah, player's name?

327
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:32,232
Tenderloin Tony.

328
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,756
Ever heard of him?

329
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,627
He's a great fucking player.

330
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,326
See, I need somebody on the
inside to set it up, OK?

331
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:42,895
You do that for us?

332
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,640
What, you're still waiting for
your finder's fee

333
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,685
aren't you honey?

334
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,606
Set it up for tonight, 10:00.

335
00:28:58,649 --> 00:28:59,520
I'll pay you then.

336
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,615
I'll take that as a yes. Silence
is a yes.

337
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,271
It wasn't a no.

338
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,543
[INAUDIBLE] a game.

339
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,024
Fuckin' unbelievable.

340
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,939
Why not?

341
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,638
[INAUDIBLE] the guy was right,
huh?

342
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,031
No way.

343
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:33,162
He's a hustla'.

344
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,519
Some of the best hustlers are
cops.

345
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:46,610
They're fucking cannibals man,
I'm telling you.

346
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,699
You ever been busted by a vise?

347
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,005
No.

348
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,748
You ever seen a vise sting in
action?

349
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,619
No.

350
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,144
Do you know any vise cops,
Paul?

351
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,101
No, I don't.

352
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,063
Well, thanks for the tip.

353
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,629
Next time I have a question
about a mark I'll

354
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:06,848
make sure and ask you first.

355
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,850
Jez, tell Carl I'll be here for
10.

356
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:09,764
All right.

357
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,831
Oh, look at this boys.

358
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,745
Little fresh flower.

359
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:38,053
Got no bitch to save your ass
now.

360
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,794
Shit.

361
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,448
Hey, listen.

362
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,719
Split up, split up.

363
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,155
I got the right.

364
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,374
I got the right.

365
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,331
You got him?

366
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,332
I got him.

367
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,251
Problem
with freelancing?

368
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:46,469
No one to watch your back.

369
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:15,498
I know you was trying to double
dip on this one.

370
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,805
Jericho called me while you
lookin'

371
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,285
for outside finder's fee.

372
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:23,767
It's just this one.

373
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:24,681
Shh.

374
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,253
Mardi Gras, 2 o'clock.

375
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:32,907
Him in the lights.

376
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,040
Six alpha four A, we got a
possible 3-90.

377
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,171
Standby.

378
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,346
Excuse me, son.

379
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,304
On the wall.

380
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,392
How many drink's you had
tonight?

381
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:44,788
It's Tenderloin Tony.

382
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:52,187
And on the seventh day, God was
fucked up, so what'd he do?

383
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,275
He invented pool.

384
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,717
I've known him since he was
..

385
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:04,634
[INAUDIBLE] chewed on nickels
and emptied them out.

386
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,332
Seeing him makes my ass itch.

387
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,555
Just let me know when Jericho
arrives.

388
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,717
If I can just get someone to
post my bond

389
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,284
I'll be right there.

390
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,241
Hello?

391
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:48,548
Hello?

392
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,115
Hey kid.

393
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:51,029
You just posted.

394
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,044
Ouh, you fucked up last night,
kid.

395
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,791
You all right?

396
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:15,923
You a cop or a queer?

397
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,842
Yeah, I'm a cop.

398
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:22,799
It's my day job.

399
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,804
Everybody has secrets.

400
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,116
OK, here's the deal.

401
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,119
Still want you to set up that
game for me.

402
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,556
Bridgers can't know I'm a cop,
though.

403
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,297
OK, but listen, smart ass.

404
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:43,907
Do the math.

405
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,040
You make the game.

406
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,173
Bridgers gets a shot at
Tenderloin Tony.

407
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:52,002
He takes him down, you move to
the head of the class.

408
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,179
That's what you want right?

409
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:56,920
Go for the brass ring.

410
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,358
Think about it.

411
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:00,663
You think about who bailed you
out?

412
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:07,583
Think about calling me.

413
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,502
All right?

414
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,243
The brass
ring.

415
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,463
What hustlers dream of.

416
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,900
But give up Carl for it?

417
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,597
Guy must have thought I had
rocks in my head.

418
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,342
Yeah it's a five dollars a game

419
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,910
unless you want some weight.

420
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:32,652
It's my table so you can go and
break it too.

421
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:40,312
Unless, just say you break and
you sink something, right?

422
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:44,011
See that fine little catfish
over there?

423
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:48,537
She's yours for 15 minutes.

424
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:58,634
But if you choke, you give us
$100.

425
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:08,775
But if you choke, you give us
$100.

426
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,298
You think he don't replace the
pawn rook?

427
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,218
I'll take over this shit, he
gon' turn your mother

428
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,654
fuckin' ass out, beli' dat.

429
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:34,409
I'm sorry, look at that.

430
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:37,020
I'm sorry, you owe us $100.

431
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:40,763
Oh, hey.

432
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,765
Where were you last night?

433
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,637
Where's Carl?

434
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,421
He's scrubbing the floors.

435
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,038
Shit.

436
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:58,825
After they jumped me, I tried
to get here,

437
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,610
but these two blue boys shook me
down.

438
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,698
Honest to Christ, Carl.

439
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:36,036
Kiss the Goat's ass.

440
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,434
Kiss it.

441
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:52,313
You fuck with my action, you're
fuckin' with my action.

442
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,314
You understand?

443
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,321
Good thing I just finished
scrubbing.

444
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:13,334
A clean office is a sign of a
clean establishment.

445
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:19,384
That's why every Monday, I come
here for scrubbing day.

446
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:24,302
Oath to God, you leavin'
anything out?

447
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:30,177
If I'm lying, I'm dying.

448
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,012
Know what a slider is?

449
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:48,195
A slider is an action that go so
well,

450
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,502
the mark don't even know he's
been hit.

451
00:38:55,333 --> 00:39:01,904
Tenderloin Tony, but he gon' be
back.

452
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,167
Can't help himself.

453
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:09,172
He think he got a chance to beat
me clean.

454
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:14,177
So, we gon' run a slider on him.

455
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,659
Gon' call out his stake horse,
and gon' set him up way.

456
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:26,364
And the next time he touch a
cue, is gon' be his last.

457
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,717
Carl laid
it out.

458
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,414
Make another game with Tony.

459
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,676
Play him on the limit.

460
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,895
Make a show of it.

461
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,549
Play the dandelion.

462
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:41,117
The idea was, once Tony realized
the level of play in the room,

463
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,816
he'd jump at the chance to play
Carl next.

464
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,426
That was the plan.

465
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,908
But I knew Tony's stake horse
was a fucking cop.

466
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,214
So you decided to call.

467
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,434
That's good.

468
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:54,653
You tell bridgers I'm a cop?

469
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,613
Did you tell him I'm a cop?

470
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,619
I didn't tell Carl shit OK?

471
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,577
OK.

472
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:11,365
C'mon, get in.

473
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,584
Go for a ride.

474
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,208
Look through those again,
anything stand out?

475
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:45,486
That last one, in the room,

476
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,487
There's your video.

477
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,401
Yeah.

478
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,277
But I wasn't in the room when it
went down.

479
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,513
It's been the bane of my fucking
existence.

480
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:17,475
Tape disappeared.

481
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,476
Bridgers was in that room.

482
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:27,006
So Bridgers must be on that
table.

483
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,573
Fucking fairytale.

484
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,012
Fairytales have happy endings.

485
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,448
You want to know how this ends?

486
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,756
DA deemed everything I had
circumstantial.

487
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:42,630
No DNA, no weapon, no videotape.

488
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,415
I lost my partner, my
assignment,

489
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,243
eventually my marriage.

490
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,376
Because you couldn't prove
shit.

491
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:53,032
Because I couldn't prove that
Bridgers was the trigger man.

492
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:55,556
You scratched on the eight
ball.

493
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,515
Yeah.

494
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,690
But I got a plan.

495
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:01,431
Hustle if you will, to get
what's owed.

496
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:02,911
Starts with that table.

497
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,438
I know Bridgers.

498
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,831
I know what he likes.

499
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,921
Especially, I know what he
hates.

500
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,097
He hates Tenderloin Tony.

501
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,839
So I called him.

502
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:21,190
I told him I was a stake horse.

503
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,932
[INAUDIBLE] high stakes game
with Bridgers, and if you

504
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:26,761
want to be my player.

505
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,548
And I need you to find a way
into the Shooting Gallery.

506
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:34,987
Desperation makes people do a
lot of stupid things.

507
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,858
And that girl of yours?

508
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,817
Desperate.

509
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:45,563
She led me to you, unknowingly
of course.

510
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,303
So this whole thing was a
fucking setup?

511
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,450
Bridgers has that tape.

512
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,713
Took it for insurance.

513
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:13,199
He owns the one thing I need,
and I

514
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:15,767
need that game to win it back.

515
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,377
I can't get it any other way.

516
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:23,470
Why the hell would Carl stake a
videotape that proves

517
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,951
he killed someone?

518
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:30,520
Allow me to demonstrate.

519
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:31,652
You know what a blank is?

520
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,745
Of course you do.

521
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,660
Fake bullet.

522
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:44,099
All bang, no bite.

523
00:43:44,143 --> 00:43:46,798
Right?

524
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,539
You know it's a blank, but
you're

525
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,498
afraid to move aren't you?

526
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,542
Go ahead, move.

527
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,157
I pull this trigger, there's
enough powder in there

528
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,028
to send a part of your skull
right through your brain.

529
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,039
You're a smart kid, but you only
got one move.

530
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,999
Set up my game for me.

531
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:17,219
Set up my fucking game for me.

532
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:18,133
I'll let you take a walk.

533
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,011
I gotta take this.

534
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:30,102
Hello?

535
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:31,016
What?

536
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:37,762
It is the right amount,
Michelle.

537
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:38,850
Hang on a sec.

538
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,982
Is Katie in the same room with
you?

539
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:43,115
Could you try just a little bit
harder to humiliate me

540
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,986
right the fuck in front of her?

541
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,292
Yeah, well I happen to be in a
meeting

542
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:49,774
here myself, incidentally.

543
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,211
So I set up the game, you let
me skate?

544
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,342
On my word.

545
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:55,867
Could you do me a favor, will
you--

546
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,172
OK, so what is it?

547
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:58,870
How much is it, according to
you?

548
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:01,133
The right and proper amount you
blackmailing--

549
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,917
Katie, hi, hi.

550
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,093
How you doing?

551
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,618
No, no, we're not fighting.

552
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:11,491
Did your mother get you to say
that?

553
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:14,973
Yeah, well, you tell her 2000 is
easily enough.

554
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:15,930
Hello?

555
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:31,511
I can't see my daughter unless I
send

556
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:32,947
her a maintenance check in the
amount

557
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:35,863
that she thinks is right.

558
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:44,785
So what do you say?

559
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,699
We got a deal?

560
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,576
There's something you need to
know about hustlers.

561
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,929
First, we're all about the
money.

562
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,932
Now, you only just met Tony.

563
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:02,585
Called him on the phone.

564
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:05,850
Told him you had some money to
play.

565
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:09,418
As long as you got some money,
he's got an opportunity

566
00:46:09,462 --> 00:46:13,031
to make it offa you.

567
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:16,034
What are you trying to say.

568
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:18,732
I think maybe he's working a
double-dump on you.

569
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,820
Can you do me a favor?

570
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:22,692
Could you speak fucking English?

571
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:26,479
Doing some business on you, with
Carl?

572
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,569
Thought ever cross your mind?

573
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:30,962
I don't doubt Bridgers could
talk

574
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:33,703
the Virgin Mary herself into
picking up a hammer,

575
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,053
but here's the thing.

576
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:40,667
That was a blank.

577
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:48,370
My other gun doesn't take
blanks.

578
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,335
You set up the game for tonight.

579
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:01,819
That hurt?

580
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,172
Don't try to fuck me.

581
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,659
Jez.

582
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:18,009
Hey, what happened?

583
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:19,140
This whole situation.

584
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,054
What's with the bags?

585
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,011
You gonna go some place?

586
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:39,237
Not now.

587
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:45,852
You're sweet.

588
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:48,724
You don't understand.

589
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:52,250
You have that one backwards
kiddo.

590
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:53,512
You get to know me a little
better,

591
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:54,600
you'll see this is what I do.

592
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:00,040
What, run away?

593
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:03,696
You don't think I know about
that?

594
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,045
That's not what I meant,
Jericho.

595
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:17,449
Listen, I'm an addict.

596
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:22,889
It's just that instead of
sticking needles up my arm

597
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,369
I gamble a lot.

598
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,072
And what happens when you gamble
is that sooner or later,

599
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:34,857
you have to leave.

600
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:36,468
You have to jet.

601
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:38,513
Things got a little too hot.

602
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:39,906
You gotta go.

603
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:41,299
That's what I'm doing.

604
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:42,648
It's all right.

605
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,345
I would've.

606
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:45,433
You don't take what I say?

607
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:58,403
Did you know
that in World War II,

608
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:08,152
Japs would use crystal meth to
give

609
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:11,807
the Japanese pilots on the
suicide mission,

610
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:14,810
right before they went off.

611
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:17,683
They would fly off into the
sunrise

612
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:24,603
feeling better than they ever
did in their goddamn lives.

613
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:32,045
Something poetic about
experiencing

614
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,047
the pinnacle of pleasure.

615
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:39,531
Hope you don't mind.

616
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:42,621
It was open. Fuckhead.

617
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:44,013
You were supposed to meet me an
hour ago.

618
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,493
What the fuck?

619
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:46,712
Hey, it's OK.

620
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,192
Hey, it's OK.

621
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:49,106
Close the door.

622
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,150
Close the door, Tony.

623
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,108
Close the door.

624
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:07,733
Take your fucking hand off me.

625
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:11,824
Fuck it Fuck you.

626
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:14,174
That's my fucking drugs.

627
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,741
That shit is expensive man.

628
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:18,439
Open your mouth.

629
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:22,008
That's expensive shit.

630
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:22,878
Come on.

631
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:23,836
Tony, fuck off.

632
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:28,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:29,755
Here we go.

634
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:30,712
Good girl.

635
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:35,413
Fuck you.

636
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:37,458
Take your fucking hand off me.

637
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,334
Fuck you.

638
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:44,770
Fuck you, man.

639
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:46,728
You said we were gonna fucking
play high.

640
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:51,994
We're going to come down to New
Orleans, fuckin'

641
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:55,302
take Carl for everything he's
got.

642
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:58,740
Take his fuckin' money, take his
pool hall, take everything.

643
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:01,874
I'm still sittin' on my ass for
two days,

644
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,789
and I still don't .

645
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,839
That's my fucking wife.

646
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:11,797
Is she OK?

647
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:30,076
I cannot think with all that
fuckin' noise.

648
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,691
Look at me, Tony.

649
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:39,172
Look me straight in the eye.

650
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,435
You do a deal on me with
Bridgers?

651
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:42,741
Fuckin' .

652
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:43,698
Fuck you.

653
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:51,445
Can you play?

654
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:52,925
Yeah.

655
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:56,581
You think you take time out of
your hectic blowjob drug

656
00:53:56,624 --> 00:53:58,887
binge schedule to make it to the
pool hall around 10ish?

657
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:03,979
Good.

658
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:04,937
I'm on my way.

659
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:12,423
Tony, you stick to the plan.

660
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:16,514
Part of which being put on some
fucking clothes.

661
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:27,829
I'm good.

662
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:28,743
How are you?

663
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,112
Hey Jez.

664
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:51,766
Case?

665
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,115
You're not thinking of going in
there

666
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,074
and spending some of my money
now are you?

667
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,035
I was just going to call you.

668
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,863
Oh, I see.

669
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:03,038
Going to a party later.

670
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:05,954
Maybe you can join us?

671
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:08,740
I'd love to, but--

672
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:11,046
But what Jez?

673
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,788
You see what would my friends
say if they see me fucking

674
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:17,009
around with a cock like you.

675
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:19,403
Where does she think she's
going?

676
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:20,447
Let's go.

677
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:07,973
Tenderloin Tony.

678
00:56:08,016 --> 00:56:10,192
I'm fishing for Carl.

679
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:13,674
You want Carl, you gotta go
through me first.

680
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:15,546
After last night's no-show?

681
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,503
You get some stones.

682
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,074
OK, I might.

683
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:24,032
Here it is.

684
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:27,775
Race tonight, Cecil a game.

685
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:29,342
And then Carl runs.

686
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,909
Five large, even.

687
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:34,521
Until someone pulls up or drains
out.

688
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:37,002
OK.

689
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:41,267
Hey, you bought it, you break
it.

690
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:46,881
All right, but not on that
table.

691
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:53,061
What you mean "none of that
type"?

692
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,019
This one.

693
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:58,197
Why that table and not this
table?

694
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,161
Yeah, this table, for sure.

695
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,034
OK.

696
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:13,255
First, I want you to tell me
why you don't like this table.

697
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:14,648
I don't like that table.

698
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:15,562
Fuck that.

699
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,960
We play on this table, or we
don't play.

700
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:27,705
Fine.

701
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:28,662
We'll play on that table.

702
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,719
Don't worry, Jez.

703
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:44,678
You'll get your shit back when
we're done with you.

704
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:46,375
That's twice you've run out on
me.

705
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,946
Sorry.

706
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,775
I'm calling in my marker, Jez.

707
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,430
About time you work off your
debt the old fashioned way.

708
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:34,309
The first two are hard and
fast, and the third is slow,

709
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,616
, cheese.

710
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:56,375
I knew it was you.

711
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:02,250
Takin' a year's worth of dog was
all you could take.

712
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:04,775
Yeah.

713
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:07,125
Carl, Carl, Carl.

714
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,954
You want to stop this, because
you got too much gamble in you.

715
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,520
That may be so.

716
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,911
First game [INAUDIBLE] busy.

717
01:01:37,955 --> 01:01:40,218
That boy done lost a lot of
money.

718
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:43,395
He's expecting to win it back.

719
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:46,311
Ain't gon' happen.

720
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:56,773
Aw, did I mess you up fella?

721
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:58,905
Oops, there go the
moneyball.

722
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:10,395
Das cold, keeping someone out of
stroke.

723
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:13,833
Somethin' me and your wife been
doing to you for what,

724
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,008
a little over a year now?

725
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:24,452
I'm done, kid.

726
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:27,368
What the fuck?

727
01:03:27,412 --> 01:03:30,502
Never play the game the other
guy expects you to play.

728
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:36,160
I was holding back so much
speed,

729
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,727
I thought I had
crawling up my ass.

730
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,124
I played you .

731
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:45,517
And you know what?

732
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,476
Yeah, Carl.

733
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,392
He thinks I don't rate.

734
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:54,613
Best damn game I'm ever going to
get it from the old man,

735
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:59,705
and now, by tomorrow, I'm going
to own Carl.

736
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:02,882
And you know who he's going to
blame it on?

737
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:03,840
You.

738
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,321
Uh-oh.

739
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:20,769
Hey, my man, what's up?

740
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:29,213
Hey, what's up brother?

741
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:30,954
That's what I said.

742
01:04:30,997 --> 01:04:33,913
Listen, you know, that kid's too
good for me.

743
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:38,178
Shit, I'm going to need--

744
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:45,055
I'm gonna to need the seven out,
raise to nine.

745
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:46,621
Frees up to 10 g's.

746
01:04:46,665 --> 01:04:51,017
Come on Carl, let's put this
arab in the limo.

747
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:52,801
That dog don't hunt, Tony.

748
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,850
Oh yeah, you made a game with a
cop.

749
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:04,204
Ain't nobody in here ever going

750
01:05:04,248 --> 01:05:05,379
to play you for money again.

751
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:11,995
He ain't a cop.

752
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,743
You're a cop?

753
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:23,963
Sorry.

754
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,443
Oops.

755
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:30,927
Fuck you.

756
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:46,333
The one thing
you learn when

757
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:48,292
you hang out in a pool hall--

758
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:55,864
you can't trust anybody, because
when

759
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:59,825
everyone's a hustler, sooner or
later,

760
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:02,262
you're going to get hustled.

761
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,308
Well, that didn't go the way I
planned.

762
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:07,746
You got everything.

763
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:10,749
I got nothing.

764
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,881
Hey, watch it.

765
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:13,839
Watch yourself!

766
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:17,930
I don't give two shits about
the money.

767
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:18,887
I don't care about the money.

768
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,628
You keep the money.

769
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:21,542
I just want the tape.

770
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:29,942
That's right, Tony.

771
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,422
You fucked.

772
01:06:31,465 --> 01:06:34,425
And don't worry, Jericho's next.

773
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:40,474
When you gon' learn that I own
you?

774
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:43,260
I own you.

775
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:44,913
Tenderloin Tony.

776
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,089
I like that name.

777
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,829
Meet the meat grinder,
motherfucker.

778
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,489
That tape?

779
01:06:55,533 --> 01:07:02,061
Just think of it as a get out of
jail free gold card.

780
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,020
Stomp this motherfucker.

781
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,461
You know this whole time?

782
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:21,820
You played me for a dandelion,
son, and I can't have that.

783
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:25,345
So now, I gotta set an example
out you.

784
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:27,478
I'ma turn yo bitch ass out.

785
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,751
Carl, I'm solid.

786
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:40,882
Let me prove it to you.

787
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:41,840
You solid?

788
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:45,757
When they're going to be
wanting to take someone

789
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,890
downtown, you make it you.

790
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:49,804
Prove it.

791
01:08:25,013 --> 01:08:27,842
Come on Tony, I'll make it up
to you.

792
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:28,800
Yeah?

793
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,152
Ooh.

794
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:34,110
Hey Tony.

795
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:36,112
You had a bad day?

796
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:37,025
I'm done.

797
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:37,983
Yeah?

798
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:42,770
I'm going home.

799
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:44,032
Yeah?

800
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:45,730
I just want to play pool.

801
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:49,037
Yeah,

802
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:50,996
Did you like that girl in the
bathroom?

803
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:55,566
She was nice.

804
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:59,135
- Yeah, she was nice. - People
are nice.

805
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,184
Yeah, people are nice.

806
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:06,490
Here you go.

807
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:28,990
Shitin' out.

808
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:32,603
That's when you make a shot you
have no business making.

809
01:09:32,646 --> 01:09:33,995
Tony?

810
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:36,128
He shit out all the time, he
just never knew it.

811
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:47,792
Wakey, wakey.

812
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:56,975
Things with you keep going from
bad to worse, don't they.

813
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,543
Maybe I should put you out of
your misery.

814
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:02,633
Think I can get away with it?

815
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:05,418
I'm going to make sure you post
tomorrow.

816
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:08,813
Train station, phone booth.

817
01:10:10,858 --> 01:10:13,165
If you think you're in trouble
now,

818
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,036
imagine what's going to happen
to you if the wrong person

819
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,603
picks up that phone.

820
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:17,952
Tomorrow, it all ends.

821
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,099
Shit.

822
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:35,970
Jez, what are you doing here?

823
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:36,928
My God, what happened?

824
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,194
It look bad?

825
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,370
Does it look bad?

826
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:47,025
Say number nine.

827
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:48,113
Number nine.

828
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,814
It's broken, I'm sorry.

829
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:55,294
Ah, that hurts.

830
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,472
What are you doing here?

831
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:05,957
What the hell happened to you?

832
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,871
Nothing, nothing.

833
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:14,182
Who did this to you?

834
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:21,320
What happened, tell me.

835
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:22,321
It's me.

836
01:11:25,759 --> 01:11:27,239
OK, listen.

837
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:33,071
I'm going to have to leave town,
OK?

838
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:35,116
Like, now.

839
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:39,077
I gotta.

840
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:44,430
All right?

841
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:45,997
Come with me.

842
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:50,697
Come with me.

843
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:54,222
I have a brother in California,
I can go and move in with him,

844
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:55,920
before it's too late.

845
01:11:55,963 --> 01:11:57,791
Forget nine ball, Cue Ball, all
it.

846
01:11:57,835 --> 01:11:59,576
Fuck it, let's do it.

847
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:00,794
We can go to Disneyland.

848
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:02,056
We go to space mountain.

849
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,322
We make out all over the
mountain, come on.

850
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:10,238
Swim in the ocean?

851
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:13,198
You like that, right?

852
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:15,156
OK.

853
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,030
OK, yeah right.

854
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:20,510
OK.

855
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:24,470
You would do that?

856
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:25,471
Really?

857
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:27,343
Oh, shit!

858
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,256
Ow, ow.

859
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:40,617
What?

860
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,314
I need to tell you something.

861
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:53,456
I'm here.

862
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:57,503
Survival is a product of
punctuality.

863
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:58,504
You keep surviving.

864
01:12:58,548 --> 01:12:59,418
Get me that tape.

865
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:00,724
Impossible.

866
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,421
OK, then.

867
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:03,466
You're dead.

868
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:07,165
Gotta catch me first, cop.

869
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,819
Figured you might say that.

870
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:09,950
Do me a favor.

871
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:10,864
Reach under the phone.

872
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:20,134
Got it?

873
01:13:20,178 --> 01:13:23,486
Open the envelope.

874
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:26,271
Jezebel Black, 26 years old,
resides

875
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:29,317
at 226 Moren Road, drive 7.

876
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:31,450
Blue El Camino.

877
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:32,712
Listens to Otis Redding in the
shower,

878
01:13:32,756 --> 01:13:35,759
sings along with it, not very
good.

879
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:40,024
It's a picture of her mother,
Rachel, in pretty silver frame,

880
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:42,330
by the edge of the bed, along
with.

881
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,688
You pickin' up what I'm laying
down?

882
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:53,080
I believe this is what is
referred

883
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:57,476
to as binding arbitration.

884
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,740
I'll get you the fucking tape,
but we do it my way.

885
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:03,917
Be at the Shooting Gallery, five
to midnight.

886
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:06,354
When this is all over, you gotta
promise

887
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:07,878
to leave us alone for good.

888
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:10,620
Cross my heart, and hope to
die.

889
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:12,056
And that gun in there?

890
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:13,231
That's from me.

891
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:14,232
You carry it.

892
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:15,581
I'll tell you when I need it.

893
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,104
Mortensen.

894
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:20,804
If you fuck me, you'll never get
that tape.

895
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:21,718
But I will.

896
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:49,223
Woah, woah, woah.

897
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:50,137
No, no.

898
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,530
Take this.

899
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:52,705
Take this.

900
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:56,753
Meet me at Algiers point, 12:30
tonight.

901
01:14:56,796 --> 01:15:00,583
If I'm not there, fly to your
brother's.

902
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:06,937
You're going to show up, right?

903
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,552
Please?

904
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:14,510
Please?

905
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:25,259
12:30.

906
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,398
Hardest
thing about being a hustler?

907
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:34,878
Trust.

908
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:36,706
You trusted no one.

909
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:39,317
You never got took.

910
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,361
I spoke to the cop.

911
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:42,233
He's coming for you, Carl.

912
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:48,544
Last night, it was a test.

913
01:15:51,024 --> 01:15:52,809
The only the way you could know
if you could trust me.

914
01:15:55,899 --> 01:16:00,599
See, at first, I thought that
detective was off his nut.

915
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,470
Desperate.

916
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:05,343
Thinking he could get you to
stake the tape on a game,

917
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:07,606
a tape that could send you to
jail, mm-mm.

918
01:16:12,524 --> 01:16:15,353
What happened in that apartment?

919
01:16:15,396 --> 01:16:18,661
That you didn't kill his men and
take his money?

920
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:25,406
Tell me, Carl.

921
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:41,292
Mortenson doesn't want that tape
because you're on it.

922
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:45,339
Oops, you scratched on
the eight ball, son.

923
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,431
He wants the tape because he's
on it.

924
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:56,263
Am I right?

925
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:59,658
Tell me I'm right.

926
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:03,140
What's worse than a cop killer?

927
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,054
Shoot him, kill him.

928
01:17:07,144 --> 01:17:08,624
That's your boy, not mine.

929
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:14,194
A cop-- that's a cop killer.

930
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:24,640
What does it take to make a law
man into an outlaw?

931
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:28,252
Show me the money

932
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:32,430
Three quarters of a mill a good
place to start.

933
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:34,693
It was his operation.

934
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,042
It was his partner.

935
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:37,000
Cops.

936
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:43,006
I like to call them the blue
tribe,

937
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:48,054
and the blue tribe are the best
hustlers of them all.

938
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:53,233
He took his shot, made me an
offer,

939
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:57,107
I said if I help him pull it
off, I get half.

940
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,413
Enough to purchase my pool hall.

941
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:00,371
So what happened?

942
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:14,690
He wanted to make me his Patsy.

943
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:22,915
He wanted to pin the whole thing
on ol' Carl.

944
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,787
Let me go to the big house for
life.

945
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:35,406
I saw it comin', and I took the
money and the tape.

946
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:37,234
Smile.

947
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:38,496
You on candid camera.

948
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:46,765
So you have it?

949
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:51,248
If I wanted, you'd die.

950
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:00,561
BANG!

951
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:07,133
Come on' Jez.

952
01:19:36,032 --> 01:19:37,729
Now look around here, huh.

953
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,036
This here is what it's got me.

954
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,257
Well, you're one hell of a
player, son.

955
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:47,826
What say you and me take a
little road trip?

956
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:53,440
You know, my stake, your game,
my experience.

957
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:54,746
Boy, we'd be unsinkable.

958
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:16,246
Boy, you done lost your natural
mind.

959
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:17,987
It ain't that easy, Carl.

960
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:25,690
It just ain't that easy.

961
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,217
Holy bejesus, boy.

962
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:32,958
Where you get all that money?

963
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:35,134
It's mine.

964
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:37,354
Do you want it?

965
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:38,398
You gotta get in a grease.

966
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:48,800
Everybody get the hell out of
here.

967
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,888
Easy, close the do' behind.

968
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,200
You don't want none of this,
son.

969
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:06,557
Nine ball?

970
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,514
Sure as shit.

971
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:16,784
You gonna give me weight?

972
01:21:16,828 --> 01:21:17,655
Nah.

973
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:19,135
You're serious.

974
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:26,359
Thousand a game?

975
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:29,928
10, 10 raise to 11.

976
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:31,625
Done.

977
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:33,105
This table cool.

978
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,019
Flip it up.

979
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:43,202
I'm going to put you in the
electric chair.

980
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,773
Good break.

981
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:05,094
OK, just a couple of hands,
talk about ..

982
01:22:05,137 --> 01:22:06,095
What's the problem?

983
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,792
What's the problem?

984
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,925
There's no problem.

985
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:10,882
There's no problem.

986
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:26,898
Sometimes I just like to look
at myself a little when I play.

987
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,597
The sharper you look the sharper
you play.

988
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:31,816
You don't know nothin' about
that

989
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:33,252
judging by the way you dress.

990
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:13,336
That's five on the road, Carl.

991
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:15,555
You hustling me?

992
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:18,732
Son, I never played this game
before in my life.

993
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:22,562
You're sharking me now?

994
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:25,913
I wouldn't think of it, son.

995
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:33,791
By the by, where's that sweet
little twist, Jezebel?

996
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,793
She ever tell you about the time
I got her

997
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:37,229
the job at the donut factory?

998
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:44,932
You know what her job specialty
was? s Sucking the hole out

999
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:46,195
the donut.

1000
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:48,458
Leave her out of this.

1001
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:51,069
She was very, very good at it,
too.

1002
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:55,073
Don't try to get in my head,
break.

1003
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:56,031
Damn.

1004
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:15,615
You like that, don't you.

1005
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,226
Thinkin' maybe I take the heat.

1006
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:22,013
Good call.

1007
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,060
That's real good.

1008
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:35,026
Because if you like that, you're
going to love this.

1009
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,941
No, now that's impossible.

1010
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,856
I've been clocking you for a
month of Sundays.

1011
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:41,250
Ain't no way you can shoot on
that side.

1012
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,029
Then he'll call.

1013
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:29,428
That's a pretty neat trick you
pulled, holding

1014
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,821
back your speed that long.

1015
01:25:33,737 --> 01:25:35,173
What you after, son?

1016
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:43,790
Oops.

1017
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:53,844
Winner take all.

1018
01:25:53,887 --> 01:25:58,805
The money, and the tape.

1019
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:01,156
And there
it was.

1020
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,940
A normal person would've walked
with his cash,

1021
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:06,378
and hopped the train with his
girl to a better life.

1022
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:09,251
C'mon son.

1023
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,862
You finally a hustler, now.

1024
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:14,299
But I am a
hustler, remember.

1025
01:26:14,343 --> 01:26:15,474
Done.

1026
01:26:15,518 --> 01:26:16,388
Rack 'em.

1027
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,275
What the fuck?

1028
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:35,668
What the fuck?

1029
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:37,148
I'm looking for Jericho, give
me the keys.

1030
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,367
- Give me the keys. - Huh?

1031
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:39,324
- Give me the fucking keys! -
I'm sorry.

1032
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:40,238
I'm sorry.

1033
01:26:40,282 --> 01:26:41,196
I'm sorry.

1034
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:26,763
What's the matter.

1035
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:28,591
You feeling guilty, son?

1036
01:27:40,342 --> 01:27:41,734
Where's all the white women at?

1037
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,136
You right.

1038
01:27:59,056 --> 01:28:00,187
So here we all stand.

1039
01:28:04,104 --> 01:28:07,107
Jericho, you with me or that?

1040
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:17,770
Binding arbitration, remember.

1041
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:19,859
Go on, make it.

1042
01:28:19,903 --> 01:28:22,122
I get the tape.

1043
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:23,428
You live happily ever after.

1044
01:28:26,388 --> 01:28:27,432
Happily ever after.

1045
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:28,520
What kind of talk is that?

1046
01:28:28,564 --> 01:28:31,349
Fairy tale.

1047
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:34,526
You dog it.

1048
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,788
All is forgiven, son.

1049
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:48,061
Hi, fuckhead.

1050
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:51,500
Motherfucker.

1051
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:54,024
All I want is my life back.

1052
01:29:03,381 --> 01:29:04,948
Scratched that shit on eight
ball.

1053
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:33,150
So it all goes down in one shot,
huh?

1054
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:44,379
The second he drops, I'll shoot
you in the fucking face.

1055
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:45,771
With that pop gun?

1056
01:29:45,815 --> 01:29:47,338
I'll take both of you one shot.

1057
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,557
Go ahead, try.

1058
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,862
Hold on why don't we all just
calm down.

1059
01:29:49,906 --> 01:29:50,776
Shut up!

1060
01:29:54,693 --> 01:29:56,260
Come on.

1061
01:29:56,303 --> 01:29:57,174
Come on.

1062
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:58,741
Get out the fucking car.

1063
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,744
What are you gonna do?

1064
01:30:01,787 --> 01:30:02,658
Let's see Carl.

1065
01:30:06,879 --> 01:30:08,141
Drop the fucking gun.

1066
01:30:08,185 --> 01:30:09,795
Kiss my black unruly ass.

1067
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:15,192
Paul.

1068
01:30:15,235 --> 01:30:16,759
Point your gun at the cop.

1069
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:17,673
Jericho.

1070
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:18,587
Jez?

1071
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:22,547
I said, point the gun at the
cop.

1072
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:23,461
You know what?

1073
01:30:23,505 --> 01:30:25,245
I don't think so, Carl.

1074
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:26,682
You chose him over me?

1075
01:30:26,725 --> 01:30:28,466
It was supposed to be me.

1076
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:29,815
Me.

1077
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:31,861
You've been a fool your whole
damn life, son.

1078
01:30:31,904 --> 01:30:33,558
Point the gun at the cop.

1079
01:30:33,602 --> 01:30:35,691
That's exactly what I'm fuckin'
talkin' about.

1080
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:36,866
You think you can take my spot?

1081
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:37,954
Huh?

1082
01:30:37,997 --> 01:30:39,129
You think I won't pull your
card?

1083
01:30:39,172 --> 01:30:42,872
Think, again, motherfucker.

1084
01:30:42,915 --> 01:30:43,786
I'm sorry.

1085
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:44,700
I'm sorry.

1086
01:30:51,184 --> 01:30:52,055
Shut up.

1087
01:30:56,886 --> 01:30:58,670
Jericho, why did you do that?

1088
01:30:58,714 --> 01:31:00,237
Why did you kill that guy?

1089
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,978
That'll have to go to the police
report--

1090
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:13,250
You gotta get out of here right
now.

1091
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:14,686
No, I'm not gonna leave without
you, no!

1092
01:31:20,562 --> 01:31:21,519
Trust me.

1093
01:31:21,563 --> 01:31:22,477
I'ma be OK.

1094
01:31:37,796 --> 01:31:39,450
They're both out, go, go, go,
go.

1095
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:51,636
That was really exciting.

1096
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,639
Be calm, cop.

1097
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:56,467
Let's end this right now.

1098
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,773
Abso-fuckin'-lutely.

1099
01:32:08,044 --> 01:32:10,829
You're empty.

1100
01:32:10,873 --> 01:32:13,789
Maybe.

1101
01:32:13,832 --> 01:32:15,791
Gimme the fuckin' tape.

1102
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:25,452
Thank you.

1103
01:32:25,496 --> 01:32:26,453
Good boy.

1104
01:32:29,848 --> 01:32:30,936
Give me my fucking spare.

1105
01:32:37,943 --> 01:32:38,814
Catch.

1106
01:32:42,774 --> 01:32:45,124
You had a gun with your prints
on it.

1107
01:32:48,998 --> 01:32:51,435
Stick your hands in your
pockets.

1108
01:32:57,659 --> 01:32:58,964
I told you.

1109
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,706
I wasn't gonna leave without
you.

1110
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:03,752
We had a deal, cop.

1111
01:33:03,795 --> 01:33:04,927
The frames over.

1112
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,015
You got the tape.

1113
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:06,972
Let us go.

1114
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:15,328
Let her go.

1115
01:33:15,372 --> 01:33:16,373
Can't do that.

1116
01:33:22,074 --> 01:33:23,032
You can't even breathe fine.

1117
01:33:23,075 --> 01:33:24,642
You'll shoot him.

1118
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:27,166
I have never killed a fucking
thing in my entire life,

1119
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:30,735
but if you hurt Jericho I will
never,

1120
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:33,216
never get tired of shooting you,
motherfucker.

1121
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:39,526
I think you should stand a
little closer with that.

1122
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,137
I think you're gonna miss.

1123
01:33:48,797 --> 01:33:49,667
Very good.

1124
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:51,713
You got that part right.

1125
01:33:51,756 --> 01:33:53,018
Oop.

1126
01:33:53,062 --> 01:33:53,976
Oop.

1127
01:33:58,807 --> 01:33:59,851
I think the safety's on.

1128
01:34:05,378 --> 01:34:11,036
I guess what we've got here is a
Puerto Rican stand off.

1129
01:34:26,095 --> 01:34:27,444
Oh no, no, no.

1130
01:34:27,487 --> 01:34:28,314
Jericho?

1131
01:34:28,358 --> 01:34:31,491
No, please, no.

1132
01:34:31,535 --> 01:34:33,276
Shit!

1133
01:34:33,319 --> 01:34:35,626
No!

1134
01:34:41,327 --> 01:34:43,460
Thanks, baby.

1135
01:34:43,503 --> 01:34:44,853
You know what a blank is?

1136
01:34:44,896 --> 01:34:47,594
All bang, no bite.

1137
01:34:47,638 --> 01:34:49,640
Cool huh?

1138
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,076
Oh my God.

1139
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:54,601
You stupid.

1140
01:35:42,475 --> 01:35:44,564
You one surprise after the
next.

1141
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:57,447
So you set it all up, huh?

1142
01:36:02,844 --> 01:36:04,193
And what you got to gain, son?

1143
01:36:14,812 --> 01:36:17,989
Remember him?

1144
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:19,599
Das my brother.

1145
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:22,298
Scratched on the eight ball,
son.

1146
01:36:26,998 --> 01:36:33,439
You a long frame on ol' Carl,
huh?

1147
01:36:33,483 --> 01:36:36,878
,, that's the kicker
for sho', isn't it?

1148
01:37:49,951 --> 01:37:52,388
My name is
Jericho Hudson.

1149
01:37:52,431 --> 01:37:55,217
Everybody has a secret.

1150
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:59,177
My brother, Robert, he knew what
Mortenson was up to.

1151
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:00,657
Hudson?

1152
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,093
That's why
I had to find out which

1153
01:38:02,137 --> 01:38:05,401
one of them took his life.

1154
01:38:05,444 --> 01:38:11,363
In a way, they both did, and I
had to set the record straight.

1155
01:38:11,407 --> 01:38:15,715
I told you from the beginning, I
am a hustler.

1156
01:38:15,759 --> 01:38:17,587
A hustler who had a goal.

1157
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:20,459
Welcome to the tribe, son.

1158
01:38:20,503 --> 01:38:21,896
So I joined
the tribe.

1159
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:29,294
Falling in love?

1160
01:38:29,338 --> 01:38:30,208
Who knew.

1161
01:38:32,994 --> 01:38:36,911
All I needed was a little
operating cash, insurance money

1162
01:38:36,954 --> 01:38:38,608
from my brother.

1163
01:38:38,651 --> 01:38:40,697
I didn't think he'd mind me
using it to catch his killer.

1164
01:38:43,743 --> 01:38:46,833
Sooner or later, a hustler with
a goal

1165
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:51,751
either ends up dead or happy.

1166
01:38:51,795 --> 01:38:56,104
And man, I ain't dead yet.

1167
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:00,064
Cool boy playin'.

1168
01:39:00,108 --> 01:39:03,589
Fat man runnin'.

1169
01:39:03,633 --> 01:39:06,549
Old fool walkin'.

1170
01:39:06,592 --> 01:39:08,072
Dead man coughin'.

1171
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:48,112
Cool boy playin' Fat man
runnin'.

1172
01:39:48,156 --> 01:39:51,115
Old fool walkin'.

1173
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:54,640
Dead man coughin'.

1174
01:39:54,684 --> 01:40:00,472
Cool boy playin', Fat man
runnin'.

1175
01:40:00,516 --> 01:40:03,954
Old fool walkin'.

1176

Dead man coughin'.
