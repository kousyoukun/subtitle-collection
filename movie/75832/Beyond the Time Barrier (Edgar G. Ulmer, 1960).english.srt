1
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,503
Good morning.

2
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,603
- Morning, Colonel.
- Oh, hi, Bill.

3
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:29,203
Well, did you make our
reservations for lunch at the club?

4
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:30,603
You and your easy living.

5
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,203
Boy, you better cut down
on some of that weight,

6
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:34,703
- or I'm gonna ground you.
- Oh, yeah? Look who's talking.

7
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,203
You know, Marty,
you're just jealous.

8
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,003
You're after my job,
and I know it.

9
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:39,303
You know, you may be right.

10
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:43,803
Okay, hero, let's get you
into your flight suit.

11
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,103
Right.

12
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,003
The flight is divided
into three phases.

13
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:54,403
Ground to maximum altitude,

14
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:56,403
maximum speed
and controllability

15
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:58,803
in the upper, thin air,

16
00:02:58,903 --> 00:02:59,903
and reentry.

17
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:03,803
Now, the turbo jet engine
will lose its efficiency

18
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:06,203
at around 50,000 feet.

19
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:09,203
Allison will coast on up
to 75,000 feet,

20
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,803
and then cut in
the new rocket engine.

21
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:15,803
He'll level off at around
500,000 feet,

22
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,603
one hundred miles above
the earth, gentlemen.

23
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:21,003
For all practical purposes,

24
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:22,903
Major Allison will be in space.

25
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,403
Now, at this altitude,

26
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:29,203
he'll lower
the ventral stabilizers

27
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:32,003
and make his high-speed
stability flight,

28
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:36,403
progressing from position
one to 20.

29
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:38,603
Now, we know the X-80
is capable of a speed

30
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:41,803
of 5,000 miles per hour.

31
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,003
In the thin air
of 100 miles altitude,

32
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:46,903
with no resistance, who knows?

33
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:51,403
What we learn from this flight

34
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:54,603
will pretty well determine
our next step into space.

35
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,203
The satteloid...

36
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,903
A man in orbit.

37
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:02,603
You all set, Major?

38
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:03,703
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,003
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I'll join you

40
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:08,703
in Flight Control shortly.

41
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,203
Hello, tracking
station number two.

42
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:21,203
This is Sands Flight Control.

43
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,403
X-80 standing by for takeoff.

44
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,003
<i>With your
permission, tower.</i>

45
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,103
<i>Am I clear to roll?</i>

46
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,503
Weather clear.

47
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:45,603
<i>You have a green light.</i>

48
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,103
<i>Good luck.</i>

49
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,203
<i>X-80 to Sands Control.</i>

50
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,203
<i>Approaching altitude
40,000 feet.</i>

51
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:19,003
<i>Airspeed 1,200,</i>

52
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,503
<i>angle of flight
85 degrees, over.</i>

53
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,603
Fifty thousand feet, Colonel.

54
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,903
<i>Turbo power cutting out.</i>

55
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:34,603
Hello, Control,
approaching 75,000 feet.

56
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:35,790
Cutting in rocket engine.

57
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:41,603
<i>Hello, Sands, this is X-80</i>

58
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,303
<i>approaching altitude
400,000 feet.</i>

59
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:49,403
<i>Okay, Colonel,
there's a new record for you.</i>

60
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,003
Good work, Allison.

61
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:53,003
How do you feel?
How's she handling?

62
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,103
<i>No, pain, no strain.
Leveling off.</i>

63
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,803
<i>Proceeding with
Phase Number Two, over.</i>

64
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:09,403
When you're ready, kid.
When you're ready.

65
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,203
This is X-80 to Sands Control,

66
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,003
approaching Position Number One.

67
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,903
<i>Altitude 500,000,
airspeed 1,000-plus.</i>

68
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:22,403
<i>Central stabilizers in position.</i>

69
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,403
<i>You ready, Colonel?</i>

70
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:26,803
Ready any time you are.

71
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,503
And the Lord be with you, over.

72
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:36,403
<i>Sands Control from X-80.</i>

73
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:37,803
<i>Position Number Four.</i>

74
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:40,803
<i>Airspeed 2,000, 2-0-0-0.</i>

75
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:41,947
<i>We're going all the way.</i>

76
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,803
<i>X-80 to Sands Control,
position Number Eight.</i>

77
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:52,603
<i>Airspeed 6,000, 6-0-0-0.</i>

78
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,603
<i>Position 10, airspeed 7,000.</i>

79
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,503
<i>No instrument leaks.</i>

80
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,903
- What is it, Martin?
- I'm not sure.

81
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,003
We've lost radio contact.

82
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,203
Colonel Martin, he's off
the tracking field!

83
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,603
Keep trying. Keep trying.

84
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,803
Sands Control to X-80.
Sands Control to X-8-O.

85
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,403
Come in, X-80.

86
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,003
Sands Control to X-80.

87
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,703
Sands to X-8-O. Come in, X-80.

88
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,103
Reentry glide successful.

89
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,403
This is X-80 preparing
for a landing.

90
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,330
Are you reading me?
Come in, Sands Control.

91
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:29,503
Hey! Anybody here?

92
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:13,403
<i>Did you make our
reservations for lunch at the club?</i>

93
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:14,803
<i>You and your
easy living.</i>

94
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:16,403
<i>Boy, you better cut down
on some of that weight,</i>

95
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:17,403
<i>or I'm gonna ground you.</i>

96
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:18,803
<i>Yeah, look
who's talking.</i>

97
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:20,403
<i>You know, Marty,
you're just jealous.</i>

98
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,203
<i>You're after my job,
and I know it.</i>

99
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,203
<i>You know,
you may be right.</i>

100
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:25,803
<i>Okay, hero, let's get you
into your flight suit.</i>

101
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:26,903
<i>Right.</i>

102
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:12,703
Where is everybody?

103
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,903
Hey! Anybody here?

104
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:07,003
Who are you? Who are you?

105
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,303
What are you doing to me?

106
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:10,803
I said what are you doing to me?

107
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,773
Can't you hear me?
Get me out of this thing!

108
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:31,803
Who... Who are you people?

109
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,803
Where am I, in a hospital
or something?

110
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,203
Where am I?

111
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:37,403
What's wrong with you?
Can't you understand me?

112
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,703
Say something!

113
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:41,808
I said answer me! Can't you...

114
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:44,903
Let go of me!

115
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,703
Oh, I'm... Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

116
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:19,203
The new prisoner has been
cleansed of radiation,

117
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,203
my Master.

118
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,803
That is well.

119
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:24,603
Let us hope we find him
more cooperative

120
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:27,403
than the previous prisoners.

121
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:30,803
I hope Trirene has learned
something from his thoughts.

122
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,203
We must be very careful.

123
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:33,603
He will use all the known
tricks.

124
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,403
We can depend on that.

125
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:38,503
We will proceed with
the usual caution, Captain.

126
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:07,003
Who are you?

127
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:08,703
Major William Allison,
US Air Force.

128
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,603
Won't you sit down Major?

129
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,203
Sir, I'd like to ask
some questions.

130
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,503
I'm very confused
about what's happened to me.

131
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:22,003
Yes, of course, Major.

132
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,203
Ask your questions.

133
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:26,403
I'd like to know where I am
and how I got here.

134
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,003
And who all you people are.

135
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,603
And the air field...
What has happened to it?

136
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:33,003
The air base, my Supreme.

137
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:34,803
Yes, I left there
at 8:00 this morning.

138
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:38,003
A half hour later,
it was in shambles, deserted.

139
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,403
Where are Colonel Martin
and the others?

140
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:43,003
I... I don't understand.

141
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,403
You are from a nation
of speaking peoples.

142
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:49,003
How glorious that must be.

143
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:51,503
Our society's less fortunate.

144
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:53,803
Your society?

145
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:55,603
Yes, you see,

146
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:57,803
we here in our citadel,

147
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:00,203
save for my captain and myself,

148
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,803
are deaf-mutes.

149
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:05,903
Even my own grandchild, Trirene.

150
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,703
Deaf-mutes?

151
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:12,903
You mean, everybody?

152
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:23,003
I don't understand.

153
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,603
There will be time
for understanding,

154
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,803
if you are cooperative.

155
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,303
Now, tell us of your nation.

156
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:34,203
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir, I'm sorry.

157
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,003
You know very well
what we're talking about.

158
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:39,003
You're not the first spy
we've ever captured.

159
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,403
What do you mean, "Spy"?

160
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:44,103
I asked some simple questions.
I expect some simple answers.

161
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,903
I want some answers.

162
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,403
What is this you're wearing?

163
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:54,103
This symbol... What is this?

164
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:57,503
New devices to deceive us,
my Master.

165
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,603
We have seen such guises before.

166
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,603
They do not fool us.

167
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:05,303
It would be wise to tell us
all you know.

168
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,603
I'm Major William Allison,
United States Air Force, sir.

169
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:13,803
Serial number 03564629.

170
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,425
That's all I'm required
to tell you.

171
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:18,803
I will use other measures,
Supreme.

172
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:20,403
I will get to the truth.

173
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:22,803
Wait, Captain.

174
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:25,403
Major, we have saved your life.

175
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:28,603
You could have been
captured by the mutants.

176
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,803
Won't you cooperate with us?

177
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,003
With your permission, sir.

178
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,203
What was your purpose
in coming here?

179
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:37,603
I don't have any purpose.

180
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:40,403
You lie, you were spying on
our solar energy installation.

181
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:42,003
How did you find us?

182
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,003
Find you? I don't even
know where I am.

183
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:45,803
You're searching for
Karl Kruse and Dr. Bourman.

184
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,003
You're one of them, aren't you?

185
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,803
I never heard of them!

186
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:51,603
Where are your people living?

187
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:53,003
Would you really
like to know, Captain?

188
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:54,803
Yes, of course I want to know!

189
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,203
Well, at this very minute,
I don't know myself.

190
00:19:57,303 --> 00:19:59,203
Captain...

191
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:01,203
He's impossible.

192
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:02,903
You're one of the scapes.
Admit it.

193
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,803
I'm an officer of
the United States Air Force.

194
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:10,203
I'd like someone to tell me
something that makes some sense!

195
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:13,203
Other nations, mutants...
What kind of talk is this?

196
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:16,003
He is very clever, my Supreme,
but I have a plan.

197
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,503
I can use him to our advantage.

198
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:25,003
Trirene does not approve
of your plan, Captain.

199
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:27,503
She has found some truth
in the major's thoughts.

200
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:32,603
I do not trust him,
especially his thoughts.

201
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,903
Even Trirene could be deceived.

202
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:42,003
Follow through with
your plan, Captain.

203
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:43,103
Yes, Master.

204
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:46,403
It will be done.

205
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:47,803
Let go of me! Let me go!

206
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:49,382
What are you doing?
What are you...

207
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:57,203
It appears you have more
than the usual interest

208
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,903
in this young Captain, Trirene.

209
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,903
He's very young-

210
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:07,103
This young man is an enemy.

211
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:09,303
We must be very careful.

212
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:16,103
I understand your wish, Trirene.

213
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:37,403
We see you, Captain!

214
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,303
We see you up there!

215
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,603
Captain is alone!

216
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,203
Who are you?

217
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:47,303
I can't see you!

218
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:50,803
Good Lord.

219
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,003
What's wrong with you?

220
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,803
We will kill you, Captain!

221
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:57,103
Mutants! I'm not the captain,
you understand?

222
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:05,203
Who are you?

223
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,403
You can talk! Answer me!

224
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:09,803
Yes, I... I... I will talk.

225
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:11,303
Stay back! I'll break his arm.

226
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:16,003
Now... The captain and his
people are your enemies.

227
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,403
Why?

228
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,003
They are listening.

229
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:20,603
They are listening
and watching us!

230
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:22,003
I don't care,
I want some answers!

231
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:23,803
Who are these people
in the citadel?

232
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:26,003
They are hiding from us!

233
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:28,003
They have food.
They have everything!

234
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,603
But we will find them.

235
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:32,403
All of them!
And kill, kill, kill them!

236
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:33,603
Why are they hiding?

237
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,603
They are infected, too.

238
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:37,203
They cannot escape!

239
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:39,003
Escape? Escape from what?

240
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,403
You are a scape...
Like Karl Kruse.

241
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:42,803
Who are the scapes?

242
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,203
You... You and Kruse,
you are scapes!

243
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,403
- We know!
- You left us to die.

244
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:49,803
You ran from the plague!

245
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,403
What plague, when?

246
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:55,603
Long ago... Long ago,
you left us here to die.

247
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:58,203
You did this to us!

248
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:00,603
We will find your hiding place

249
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:03,803
and we will kill all of you!

250
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:06,803
I did this?

251
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:08,703
Has the whole world gone mad?

252
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:34,803
Young man, my granddaughter
has chosen to protect you.

253
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:38,003
She has expressed faith
in what you've told us.

254
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:41,403
My captain and I will
trust her judgment.

255
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,603
Trirene has a gift
we do not possess.

256
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,603
She has an extrasensory power.

257
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:49,803
She's able to perceive
every thought

258
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:50,903
within our minds.

259
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:57,203
Go with her, young man.

260
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,003
You will have the freedom
of our citadel.

261
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:02,103
And our child will be happy.

262
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,203
Oh, thank you.

263
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,503
Uh... Thank you.

264
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:48,603
Hey... Am I starved.

265
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:49,603
That looks great.

266
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:51,403
Uh, thank you.

267
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,503
Uh... Thank you.

268
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:02,003
Oh, I...

269
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,903
I... I was just looking around.

270
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,503
I mean, uh...

271
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,203
Trirene, I want to thank you

272
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:15,303
for rescuing me.

273
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,003
But, you know, that captain
seems determined

274
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:19,503
that I'm an enemy.

275
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:23,003
If you could only talk.

276
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,403
If I could only
make you understand.

277
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:26,903
I... I'll go out of
my mind if I...

278
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:30,712
You know what I'm thinking,
don't you?

279
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:34,003
You know how important
it is for me to find out

280
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:36,103
exactly what happened,
and how I got here.

281
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:50,803
The City?

282
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:51,803
You and all the people here

283
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,556
once lived in this city,
is that right?

284
00:26:54,703 --> 00:26:55,903
No?

285
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,303
Hmm.

286
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:12,803
Oh, your grandfather,
the Supreme.

287
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,603
He lived in the city?

288
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:15,703
I see.

289
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:23,903
Your father?

290
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:35,303
And your mother.

291
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:37,825
They came here
before you were born?

292
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:43,182
Then you've never lived in the
air and sunlight, have you?

293
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:48,203
Trirene, tell me.

294
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:49,603
Why did they abandon that city

295
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,225
and move to this
subterranean world?

296
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:58,203
The mutants?

297
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,603
The plague? Was it the plague
they told me about?

298
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:02,603
Trirene, try to understand this.

299
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:04,003
I was on an air field
this morning.

300
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:05,203
In less than an hour,
everything had changed.

301
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:07,003
All the people I knew were gone.

302
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,603
There was no plague
where I came from.

303
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:09,903
What happened?

304
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:13,599
What happened to your
father and mother?

305
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:21,903
The mutants killed them?

306
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:25,603
Oh, I'm...

307
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,903
I'm very sorry.

308
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:37,003
You know my thoughts
before I express them, so...

309
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,203
You know I'm going to ask you
about Karl Kruse.

310
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,703
Is he here in the citadel?

311
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,003
Look, would you take me to him?

312
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,003
I think if I can
get to Karl Kruse,

313
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:47,903
he can help me
understand all this.

314
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,403
Trirene gives me to understand

315
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:55,803
that you are one of us.

316
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,503
I don't know, I'm not sure.

317
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,203
I think you are.

318
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:12,403
How long have you been here
in the citadel?

319
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:13,803
Since this morning.

320
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:15,603
Well, I'm not certain.
I don't know.

321
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:17,403
I've lost track.

322
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:20,103
Time has very little meaning
here in the citadel, I fear.

323
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,003
Trirene informs me
that you have been here

324
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:29,203
for three turns of the earth.

325
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:30,603
That is three days.

326
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,603
I've only been in this place
a few hours.

327
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:35,803
I took off from the field
at 0800 this morning.

328
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:37,603
I had hoped that you'd
be able to explain this...

329
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,203
Do not excite yourself.

330
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,603
We will explain.

331
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:42,603
There'll be plenty of time.

332
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:44,603
Let me introduce myself.

333
00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:46,603
I'm Karl Kruse.

334
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,803
Used to be General Karl Kruse.

335
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:50,003
This is Professor Bourman.

336
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:52,003
How do you do?

337
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:55,003
Major William Allison,
United States Air Force.

338
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,003
Did you say United States
Air Force?

339
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:00,803
Why, yes... What's so
unusual about that?

340
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:04,403
Major Allison, what year
was your flight in?

341
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:05,803
I told you, today...
This morning.

342
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:07,203
But what day and what year,
Major?

343
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:08,803
It is important we know.

344
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:11,003
March 5, 1960.

345
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,703
1960?

346
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,003
He's from before the plague.

347
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:19,603
How is this possible, Professor?

348
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,803
What is this plague
I keep hearing about?

349
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:23,003
You really don't know, do you?

350
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:24,203
No, I don't know...
I don't know where I am

351
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:25,803
or how I got here,
and I don't know

352
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:28,003
who these people are
in the citadel, either.

353
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:31,203
Well, Trirene has found herself
a big, good-looking playmate.

354
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:32,803
And a fiery one, too.

355
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:37,203
Major Allison,
this is ex-Captain Markova.

356
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:38,403
I don't know that I like

357
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,803
what you have on your mind,
Captain.

358
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:42,203
Maybe when you find out
what she has on hers,

359
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:43,203
you'll like that better.

360
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:45,003
What are you driving at?

361
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,203
They've giving you the run
of this place, haven't they?

362
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:48,203
Yes...

363
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:49,403
So little Trirene here

364
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:50,503
can get busy and...

365
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:03,203
What kind of female are you?

366
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:05,203
I had to do it.

367
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,403
Don't you understand?

368
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,603
You mean, she was
reading your thoughts?

369
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,403
Things you didn't
want her to know.

370
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:11,503
That's right.

371
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:38,603
We can talk now,
but not for long.

372
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:39,803
The captain will be
up here any minute

373
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:41,603
to see what's happened
to his gadgets.

374
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:42,603
Watch out for him.

375
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:44,403
He rules this place
with an iron fist.

376
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:46,003
Yes, so I found out.

377
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:48,003
He's determined
I'm an enemy spy,

378
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:49,603
a, uh, "Scape," he called it.

379
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:51,003
That's the name
they have given us...

380
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,803
We who escaped
the cosmic plague.

381
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:55,003
They hate us
for leaving them behind.

382
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,003
Luckily, we convinced them
they needed us.

383
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:59,403
Otherwise, we'd still be down
in the pit with the mutants.

384
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:02,403
We keep the solar power system
operating.

385
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,603
All their skilled men
have died off.

386
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:07,003
Then the mutants are the ones
who did not escape the plague.

387
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:08,603
- Is that right?
- No, the people here,

388
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:10,603
in this citadel, didn't either.

389
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,573
They are all first-stage
mutants themselves.

390
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:15,203
Is that why
they're deaf and mute?

391
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:16,803
And sterile.

392
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:18,503
Except for Trirene, perhaps.

393
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,603
Sterile?

394
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:25,003
Yes... They are a dying race.

395
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,403
There hasn't been a new birth
in this citadel

396
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:28,203
for the past 20 years.

397
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:31,203
That's where you fit
into the plan, Allison.

398
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:32,403
Make no mistake about it.

399
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:35,003
- What do you mean?
- Regeneration.

400
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:37,403
Trirene has chosen you
as her mate.

401
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:38,803
You're the last hope
of this society.

402
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,003
I don't understand it.

403
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,203
There wasn't any plague
this morning.

404
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:42,403
When did it happen?

405
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:44,803
Major Allison, have you any idea

406
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:47,003
what year this is,
right here, right now?

407
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:49,203
Well, of course I know
what year it is.

408
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:50,203
What's that got to do with it?

409
00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:54,603
Everything...
Major, this is 2024.

410
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:57,203
- It's what?
- 2024.

411
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:59,803
Sixty-four years into
the future for you, Major.

412
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,603
The plague we are talking
about, it hadn't happened

413
00:34:01,703 --> 00:34:03,603
in your world in 1960.

414
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:05,703
It began in 1971.

415
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:10,603
An atomic war?

416
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,003
No, no.

417
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,103
The feared nuclear war
never occurred.

418
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:17,403
When man set foot on the moon,

419
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:19,403
all nations started
to work together

420
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:22,203
to push on into space.

421
00:34:22,303 --> 00:34:25,403
By 1970, colonies had been
established on both Mars

422
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,003
and Venus.

423
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:29,203
Then, if it wasn't nuclear
war, what did cause it?

424
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,403
A bombardment
of cosmic radiation

425
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,603
from outer space.

426
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,803
Bombardment from outer space?

427
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:36,003
Oh, now, wait a minute.

428
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:37,603
You wait...

429
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:39,003
Now, listen to me, Allison.

430
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:40,803
The people of your world
are concerned

431
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:42,403
about nuclear fallout.

432
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:46,603
Well, heh, the danger is
in the other extreme.

433
00:34:46,703 --> 00:34:49,203
The tons of radioactive dust

434
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,803
that have mushroomed up
into the ionosphere

435
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,803
since the very first
A-bomb test.

436
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:56,003
That dust has remained up there,

437
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:59,803
and it's slowly destroying
the protective screen

438
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:03,403
that has filtered deadly
cosmic rays from space

439
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:06,603
since time began.

440
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:08,003
Do you understand, Major?

441
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:09,803
Yes.

442
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:10,803
And all the nuclear explosions

443
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,603
that have ever taken place
on Earth

444
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:13,603
have contributed to this.

445
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:15,803
Yes.

446
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:19,003
And every human being left
has become mutant...

447
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:21,503
Or sterile...
Or a combination of both.

448
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,003
If what you say is true,
then Colonel Martin

449
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:26,003
and all the others
were caught up in it.

450
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:27,203
What's happened to them?

451
00:35:27,303 --> 00:35:28,203
How can I find out?

452
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:29,803
There isn't any way.

453
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:32,203
Let's only hope they were
amongst the lucky ones

454
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:33,403
who could evacuate.

455
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:34,403
Evacuate?

456
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:35,803
Yes.

457
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:39,003
In 1973, the mass
evacuation began

458
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,803
to the planet colonies.

459
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:43,603
Only the uninfected ones
were permitted to go.

460
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:45,203
The ones left behind
moved underground

461
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,803
as fast as possible
and started building

462
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:50,203
networks of tunnels...
Like this one.

463
00:35:50,303 --> 00:35:52,203
More than half the population
of the world was wiped out

464
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:54,203
during the first year.

465
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:56,403
I see.

466
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:59,003
When I landed on the air base,

467
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:01,603
it was completely destroyed,
demolished.

468
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,003
Deserted.

469
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:04,603
You landed? You didn't crash?

470
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:06,403
The captain!

471
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:08,003
When they found you,
they destroyed your ship?

472
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:10,003
No, no... I left the air base.

473
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,203
They captured me afterwards.

474
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,203
Then your plane is in
operating condition,

475
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,003
sitting out there
on the air base?

476
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:17,603
Well, I suppose so.

477
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:19,095
Unless the mutants
have found it.

478
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:28,403
Well, Kruse, I see you've
become acquainted

479
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,003
with our new prisoner.

480
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:31,403
Yes, Captain.

481
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:34,003
And it is your good fortune,
as well as ours,

482
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:36,603
Major Allison has an excellent
technical background

483
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:38,203
and he's eager to help us.

484
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:40,203
And, as you know, Captain,
we are in dire need

485
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,803
of skilled help.

486
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,103
Well, we shall see.

487
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,603
Where's Trirene?

488
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:49,603
I believe she's returned
to her chambers, Captain.

489
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:51,503
I think she's expecting
a visitor.

490
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:54,803
Come along with me, Major.

491
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:56,703
We have some things to discuss.

492
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:14,603
Kruse, I'm warning you,
I'll tolerate

493
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,203
no more of your scheming.

494
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:18,738
If you persist, I'll see that
you're back in the dungeon.

495
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:30,003
We've got to get to the major
before they convince him

496
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,303
we're his enemies.

497
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:37,803
But, unfortunately, I do not
understand such things.

498
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:39,603
I am not a scientist.

499
00:37:39,703 --> 00:37:41,803
My concern is a military one.

500
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:44,203
I must save the last
of my people.

501
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,203
Then it is true...
Your society is doomed.

502
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:48,803
Major Allison, I must warn you.

503
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,403
Karl Kruse and his group
are shrewd.

504
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:52,403
They'll use you... They're
the most dangerous scapes

505
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,203
I've ever encountered.

506
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:57,803
It would be wise for you
not to associate with them.

507
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,295
Come, I'll show you
your chamber.

508
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,203
Major, I must
tell you the truth.

509
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:34,603
Understand, it's not an easy
thing for me to do.

510
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,003
What they say about us is true.

511
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:38,603
We are sick and dying.

512
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:41,403
You cannot imagine with the
envy that I look upon you,

513
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:44,403
Kruse, and Dr. Bourman.

514
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:47,203
I myself am in the first
stages of mutation.

515
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:48,803
You?

516
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:50,003
For this reason, I have no love

517
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:51,803
for you who have
escaped the plague,

518
00:38:51,903 --> 00:38:53,803
but as the Supreme has told you,

519
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:55,903
we will trust
in Trirene's judgment.

520
00:38:57,303 --> 00:39:00,003
Major Allison, I ask you,

521
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,003
do nothing that will
bring harm to her.

522
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,103
For Trirene is our only hope.

523
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,103
Trirene?

524
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:37,503
Trirene.

525
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:01,003
Trirene...

526
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:02,303
I want to talk to you.

527
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:10,803
Look, I... I'm very sorry
about the things.

528
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:11,903
Markova said to you.

529
00:40:14,903 --> 00:40:16,903
I don't believe any of
the things they told me.

530
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:20,086
You know I'm telling
the truth, don't you?

531
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:26,103
You know, you're very lovely.

532
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,303
I keep forgetting
you can read my thoughts.

533
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:44,103
I wish you couldn't.

534
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:10,903
What can I say?

535
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,703
You're not angry?

536
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:18,408
You know, you have an unfair
advantage over every man.

537
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:44,803
What are you doing here?

538
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,403
Ah, take it easy.

539
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,403
Don't you think I know what'll
happen to me if I'm caught?

540
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:51,003
You were spying on us.

541
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:52,903
Don't be foolish...
I couldn't care less.

542
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,503
Come here.

543
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,803
- I better get back.
- Wait...

544
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:07,803
Kruse has to see you.
He has a plan.

545
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,003
I don't know whether I'd better
be seeing any of you or not.

546
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,403
We may be able
to get you out of this

547
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:12,803
and back to your own time.

548
00:42:12,903 --> 00:42:15,003
How can I possibly go back
to my own time

549
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:16,803
if I don't know how I got here?

550
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:19,603
You don't, but Kruse
and Bourman do.

551
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,203
Look, why should it be me?

552
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,903
Why not Kruse or Bourman?

553
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:27,603
Or... Even you, Markova?

554
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:30,138
There'd be nothing to be gained
by returning to our time.

555
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:32,803
It's different with you.

556
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:34,803
You're from before the plague.
You may be able to...

557
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:37,077
I may be able to prevent it,
is that what you mean?

558
00:42:37,303 --> 00:42:38,303
Of course.

559
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:43,203
You've got to take this chance.

560
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:45,203
If you can get back to your
people and prevent the plague,

561
00:42:45,303 --> 00:42:46,503
all this will never happen.

562
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,403
Let's go talk
to Kruse and Bourman.

563
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:52,503
Come on.

564
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,803
Yes, I agree...
I have to get back

565
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:17,003
to my time, to 1960.

566
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,003
Oh, we have
a very good chance, Major,

567
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:22,003
if we can reverse the phenomenon
that brought you here.

568
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:24,403
What phenomenon
did bring me here?

569
00:43:24,503 --> 00:43:27,803
It is what we know
as a relativity paradox.

570
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:31,003
It's another dimension,
a fifth dimension.

571
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:32,603
Fifth dimension?

572
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:35,003
Professor Bourman's principle
of gravitation propulsion

573
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:36,603
brought it about.

574
00:43:36,703 --> 00:43:39,403
By 1970, it became
the standard system

575
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:42,403
used to travel to the planets
at the speed of light.

576
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:43,903
The speed of light?

577
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:47,803
I thought 10,000 miles an hour
was fast.

578
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:50,203
Yes, but there
is a pitfall

579
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,403
in the system.

580
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,003
At speeds approaching
that of light,

581
00:43:53,103 --> 00:43:55,803
it is possible to break
the time lock.

582
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:58,003
The, um, barrier
that holds all things

583
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:00,803
in a normal time relationship
to each other.

584
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,603
That's what
happened to all of us.

585
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:04,803
We have slipped out
of one time sphere

586
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:05,803
and into another.

587
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:09,003
Captain Markova
broke through in 1973

588
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:11,003
during her third flight.

589
00:44:11,103 --> 00:44:13,603
She was transporting supply
from Central Europe

590
00:44:13,703 --> 00:44:15,203
to the Venus planet.

591
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:17,503
The captain's men
destroyed her ship.

592
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,203
It happened to Kruse and I
years later.

593
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:23,003
We had returned to earth
for an observation flight

594
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:24,803
in 1994.

595
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:26,203
Our ship crashed.

596
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:29,003
1994?

597
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:30,803
But the speed I approached
in the X-80

598
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:32,803
was nowhere near
the speed of light.

599
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,003
That may be.

600
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,003
But it was just enough

601
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:38,203
to create certain
mathematical conditions.

602
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,803
Let me show you.

603
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:46,403
Here, these symbols
represent the earth,

604
00:44:46,503 --> 00:44:49,803
the sun, and your ship.

605
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:52,803
Now, consider these known facts.

606
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:56,003
The earth is rotating
at 1,000 miles per hour.

607
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:59,403
But it is also revolving
in orbit around the sun

608
00:44:59,503 --> 00:45:02,003
at 66,000 miles per hour.

609
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:04,203
Time as we know it

610
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:07,403
is relative to these movements.

611
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,803
But the entire solar system,

612
00:45:09,903 --> 00:45:12,203
together with other systems
of our galaxy,

613
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:17,003
are moving through space at
over six million miles per hour.

614
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:19,003
Theoretically,
you had a velocity

615
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:22,203
approaching the speed of light
before you ever left the ground.

616
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,003
Yes, but everything is moving
at that speed together,

617
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:26,403
as one unit...
The air, the earth,

618
00:45:26,503 --> 00:45:28,003
according to the law of gravity.

619
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,403
Time is not affected
by the laws of gravity.

620
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:32,203
This is what happened to you.

621
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:34,603
At some point during
your high-speed flight,

622
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:37,003
you approached escape velocity,

623
00:45:37,103 --> 00:45:39,403
Twenty-five thousand
miles per hour.

624
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,803
It was at this time that you
altered your flight angle.

625
00:45:42,903 --> 00:45:45,403
If you hadn't, probably you
would have gone on into orbit.

626
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:49,203
It was this angle at a
specific altitude and velocity

627
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:51,003
that broke the time barrier.

628
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:53,803
For a fraction of a second,
you were suspended in space,

629
00:45:53,903 --> 00:45:55,403
no longer interlocked
with the time spheres

630
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,403
of the sun and the earth.

631
00:45:57,503 --> 00:46:00,803
Now, during this split second,
our galaxy moved onward in time

632
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:03,403
for what amounted to 65 years.

633
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:06,803
An instant later, you had
rejoined our solar system,

634
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:08,403
and the rest you know.

635
00:46:08,503 --> 00:46:10,403
Yes.

636
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:13,803
Then, if I repeat
the altitude, angle of flight,

637
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:17,003
and speed, in directly
the opposite direction,

638
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:19,303
I should go back into time
65 years.

639
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:24,603
Precisely.

640
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:26,603
Dr. Bourman is working
on the formula.

641
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,803
The three factors must be exact.

642
00:46:28,903 --> 00:46:30,603
Then we must locate
an escape from the citadel,

643
00:46:30,703 --> 00:46:32,603
- so I can find my ship.
- Right.

644
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,403
We must obtain an early map
of the citadel

645
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:36,403
with the tunnel work.

646
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,803
Your air base surely
must be included.

647
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:42,003
They began construction
as early as 1972.

648
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:45,003
The maps are on file
at the Supreme's chamber.

649
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:47,603
There is only one way
to get them, Major.

650
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:49,203
You mean Trirene?

651
00:46:49,303 --> 00:46:51,803
- That's the only way.
- No.

652
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,003
No, I won't turn her
against her own people.

653
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,403
You have to do it.

654
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:57,603
It's up to you, Major.

655
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:59,303
You haven't much time
to decide.

656
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:05,603
Very well...

657
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:06,703
I'll do it.

658
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:09,803
You stay here.

659
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:11,303
I'll find my way back.

660
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:43,403
Trirene, I've got
to have your help.

661
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,403
It's very difficult for me
to know what to do,

662
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:46,547
but there's something...

663
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:20,503
What would I do without you?

664
00:49:22,903 --> 00:49:25,403
Trirene...

665
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,803
Tell me you know
I'm doing the right thing.

666
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:31,003
I've got to try and go back.

667
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:32,538
You do understand that,
don't you?

668
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:39,003
There won't have to be
any citadel.

669
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:40,803
You and your people can live
on the surface of the earth

670
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:43,103
without fear of any
cosmic plague.

671
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:00,903
They're waiting.

672
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:17,003
I made this tracing
from the original map.

673
00:50:17,103 --> 00:50:18,803
Then Trirene returned it
to the archives.

674
00:50:18,903 --> 00:50:19,903
Here, let me show you.

675
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,603
Now... Here's the citadel.

676
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:28,003
I remember a wooded area
and a hill.

677
00:50:28,103 --> 00:50:30,203
The solar antenna
was atop the hill.

678
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:33,803
They must have hit me with
that paralyzing ray about here.

679
00:50:33,903 --> 00:50:37,203
This outlet must be
Perimeter 22-B.

680
00:50:37,303 --> 00:50:39,003
Here's the highway...
If I can find that,

681
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,803
I can follow it directly
to the air base.

682
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,603
We need the gun we have hidden.

683
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:44,003
- And your flight suit.
- Yes.

684
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:45,603
What about
the time lock formula?

685
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:46,803
I'm working on it now.

686
00:50:46,903 --> 00:50:48,103
I'm almost finished.

687
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,603
If nothing goes wrong, Allison,

688
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:00,003
you can be on your way
within a few hours.

689
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:01,603
It should be no great problem.

690
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,903
Trirene will lead us
by the guards.

691
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:12,303
Good.

692
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:37,203
No, it is not
the equipment, Master.

693
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,603
It's another one
of their devices

694
00:51:38,703 --> 00:51:40,203
to prevent us
from watching them.

695
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:42,603
They're planning an escape,
and I know it.

696
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:45,203
I'll put a stop to this scheme.
Just say the word.

697
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,603
They will only try again.

698
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:49,303
Trirene is helping them.

699
00:51:52,103 --> 00:51:57,403
I fear our future is done,
Captain.

700
00:51:57,503 --> 00:52:00,203
We have returned to the cave

701
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:03,003
where men first lived on earth.

702
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:05,903
We have returned
to our birthplace to die.

703
00:52:13,303 --> 00:52:15,803
Through Allison and Trirene,
there is hope, Master.

704
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,603
Perhaps it is too great a hope.

705
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,203
There may be some truth
in what they say.

706
00:52:21,303 --> 00:52:22,803
Some chance that this young man

707
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:26,403
could return to a time
before the plague.

708
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:27,603
No, it's a trick.

709
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:30,003
We must not
let the major escape.

710
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:31,803
Do not forget, Master,
our observers

711
00:52:31,903 --> 00:52:34,403
sighted mutant scouts
again yesterday.

712
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:36,503
This is a time
for great caution.

713
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:40,003
I will speak to him.

714
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:43,603
Perhaps I can persuade him
to accept our way.

715
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,903
Yes, my Supreme.
Let me bring him to you.

716
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:23,603
What's the meaning of this?

717
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:25,003
Don't ask me questions.

718
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:26,803
The Supreme and I trusted you.

719
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,603
We're aware of your scheme.

720
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,403
I could explain to you forever.

721
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:31,203
You'd never understand!

722
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:33,003
I warned you to stay away
from those three.

723
00:53:33,103 --> 00:53:34,903
Now you'll answer
to the Supreme.

724
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:47,203
Then you don't
believe it's possible

725
00:53:47,303 --> 00:53:48,903
for me to return to my own time?

726
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:53,003
Kruse and Bourman think
the plague can be prevented

727
00:53:53,103 --> 00:53:55,803
if I can go back
and inform my people.

728
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:59,003
I truly wish I could
believe your reasoning.

729
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,603
But they are using you
for their own purpose.

730
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:03,403
They'll bring others.

731
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,403
They'll destroy our citadel.

732
00:54:05,503 --> 00:54:06,803
But you don't understand.

733
00:54:06,903 --> 00:54:09,403
I'm from a time before
any of this has ever happened.

734
00:54:09,503 --> 00:54:10,803
I must go back.

735
00:54:10,903 --> 00:54:13,403
Such things do not exist.

736
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:17,203
Kruse has created these
illusions in your mind.

737
00:54:17,303 --> 00:54:20,603
Look... As far
as I'm concerned, it's 1960.

738
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:24,603
You people can believe it's
2024 or any time you please.

739
00:54:24,703 --> 00:54:26,803
None of this is real.
It's all an illusion to me.

740
00:54:26,903 --> 00:54:28,803
No, my son.

741
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:30,003
You're wrong.

742
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,003
Here, touch my hand.

743
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:34,003
Is that not real flesh?

744
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:37,603
And these walls...
Are they not solid stone?

745
00:54:37,703 --> 00:54:40,203
And Trirene...
You have touched her.

746
00:54:40,303 --> 00:54:42,103
Can you say she's not real?

747
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:45,803
Yes, they are all
very real things!

748
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:48,203
But you can't prove
that what you say is true.

749
00:54:48,303 --> 00:54:50,403
The only proof
I can offer is the fact

750
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:52,603
that here we are in this room.

751
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:55,503
Can you prove that
you are somewhere else?

752
00:54:57,703 --> 00:54:59,803
Supreme...

753
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:03,203
Trirene believes
in what I'm trying to do.

754
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,003
You have faith in
her judgment, haven't you?

755
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:07,803
Yes, but Trirene
has fallen in love.

756
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:10,403
Please, I ask you...

757
00:55:10,503 --> 00:55:13,203
Give up this futile scheme.

758
00:55:13,303 --> 00:55:15,003
Remain here.

759
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,103
You will inherit our domain.

760
00:55:21,303 --> 00:55:22,903
I'm sorry, I...

761
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:28,903
I value my freedom more than this.

762
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:52,003
Hear me, fellow prisoners!

763
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:54,203
Hear me, fellow prisoners,
you're free!

764
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:55,403
The citadel is yours!

765
00:56:55,503 --> 00:56:56,803
Hear me, mutants!

766
00:56:56,903 --> 00:56:58,203
Come out of your pit of death.

767
00:56:58,303 --> 00:56:59,703
Our time of vengeance has come!

768
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:03,003
Follow me, soldiers of revenge.

769
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:06,103
I'll lead you to the captain,
to food, to freedom!

770
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,803
So you will attempt this escape,

771
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:23,803
even though we'll
try and stop you?

772
00:57:23,903 --> 00:57:26,403
Yes.

773
00:57:26,503 --> 00:57:28,403
I'll try to escape,
even though the captain

774
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:31,003
offers all resistance.

775
00:57:31,103 --> 00:57:35,303
You will never leave
the citadel alive.

776
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,403
Well, uh...

777
00:57:38,503 --> 00:57:39,938
That's a chance
I'll have to take.

778
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:04,403
I didn't think for one minute

779
00:58:04,503 --> 00:58:06,803
the Supreme would
change your mind.

780
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:09,603
Now you're my responsibility.

781
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:11,203
And I'm gonna take charge.

782
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:12,903
You're going back to the pit.

783
00:58:29,703 --> 00:58:30,803
They'll tear them to pieces!

784
00:58:30,903 --> 00:58:32,203
Are you out of your mind?
You set them free!

785
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:33,803
It's part of the plan.

786
00:58:33,903 --> 00:58:36,103
Get to your room
for your flying suit... Move!

787
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:47,803
Where are Kruse and Bourman?

788
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:49,203
We're meeting them
at the elevator up.

789
00:58:49,303 --> 00:58:51,003
You'd better go in
and get Trirene.

790
00:58:51,103 --> 00:58:52,603
We don't need her anymore.

791
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:54,803
The citadel's in chaos. The
guards won't bother with us.

792
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:57,003
You don't think I'd leave her
here to face this, do you?

793
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:58,403
I'm taking her with me.

794
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:00,403
You can't, Allison, you can't
take her back with you.

795
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:01,903
Ru try.

796
00:59:05,903 --> 00:59:08,203
Don't you understand?

797
00:59:08,303 --> 00:59:11,003
You can't take her back through
the time barrier with you.

798
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:12,203
Your world is before
she was born.

799
00:59:12,303 --> 00:59:13,503
I'll try anyway!

800
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:16,403
No.

801
00:59:16,503 --> 00:59:18,803
From now on, it's you and me.

802
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:20,990
I'm going back through
the time barrier with you.

803
00:59:23,303 --> 00:59:25,003
We're going back to my time.

804
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,403
1973.

805
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:27,803
The formula...

806
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,203
You're double-crossing
Kruse and Bourman.

807
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,103
Not for long!

808
00:59:34,703 --> 00:59:36,903
Leave her, Major.
There's no time, come on.

809
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:47,003
We're in luck.

810
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:48,703
The guards are being withdrawn.

811
01:00:51,303 --> 01:00:52,403
What did you do?

812
01:00:52,503 --> 01:00:53,503
I had to do it!

813
01:00:54,903 --> 01:00:57,003
You see?
He would have killed us all.

814
01:00:57,103 --> 01:00:59,503
Like Markova, he wanted
to your plane, Allison.

815
01:01:00,903 --> 01:01:02,203
I think you're lying, Bourman.

816
01:01:02,303 --> 01:01:05,003
I think you're the one who
wanted to make that flight.

817
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:06,903
That will be all, Major Allison!

818
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:11,003
The Supreme was right
about you and Kruse.

819
01:01:11,103 --> 01:01:15,203
Because we wanted
to return to 1994? Yes.

820
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:16,203
But you said I could prevent
the cosmic plague

821
01:01:16,303 --> 01:01:17,603
if I could go back.

822
01:01:17,703 --> 01:01:19,903
You could... But your people
won't believe you.

823
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,603
This is mass murder.

824
01:01:22,703 --> 01:01:24,203
You're letting these people die!

825
01:01:24,303 --> 01:01:26,603
I will never break
through the barrier

826
01:01:26,703 --> 01:01:28,803
in 2024 again.

827
01:01:28,903 --> 01:01:31,803
I will never know
anything about it.

828
01:01:31,903 --> 01:01:34,403
Get out of your flight suit,
Allison.

829
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:36,103
You'll have to take it off me.

830
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:27,903
Trirene...

831
01:02:32,303 --> 01:02:33,303
I'm sorry.

832
01:02:49,703 --> 01:02:52,003
We're going back to my world.

833
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:53,103
We're free now.

834
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:58,703
I... I understand.

835
01:03:00,103 --> 01:03:01,903
I'll take you
to your grandfather.

836
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:56,203
Now the shadow of death

837
01:04:56,303 --> 01:04:58,903
darkens the halls
of our citadel.

838
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:04,303
Our bright ray of hope is gone.

839
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:08,903
It is the end of us.

840
01:05:11,103 --> 01:05:15,003
No... No, it's not the end.

841
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:18,803
As long as we believe,
there is always hope.

842
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:21,203
I'll return to my time
and my people.

843
01:05:21,303 --> 01:05:23,803
We will prevent the plague.

844
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,403
You'll not live
in a world of darkness.

845
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,803
I pray that this you believe in

846
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:29,603
is not a dream.

847
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:32,103
No, it isn't... I promise you.

848
01:06:01,303 --> 01:06:02,703
I believe in you.

849
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:15,103
I lead you safely
to the surface.

850
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:45,503
I believe.

851
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:07,403
Sands Control to X-80.
Sands to X-8-O.

852
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:08,903
Come in, X-80.

853
01:08:19,103 --> 01:08:20,603
<i>Hello, Sands,
this is X-80!</i>

854
01:08:20,703 --> 01:08:22,203
<i>I'm in serious trouble!</i>

855
01:08:22,303 --> 01:08:24,803
<i>Coming in for a landing.
Are you reading me?</i>

856
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:27,303
Alert all crash detail
to stand by.

857
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:38,803
What room is he in, Sergeant?

858
01:09:38,903 --> 01:09:40,503
Operating Room Two, sir.

859
01:09:44,903 --> 01:09:45,903
How is he?

860
01:09:47,303 --> 01:09:49,503
I haven't... Good Lord!

861
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,003
What's happened to him, Doctor?

862
01:09:56,103 --> 01:09:57,403
What could have caused this?

863
01:09:57,503 --> 01:09:59,003
I don't know.

864
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:01,803
I have no explanation.

865
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:03,603
Not one word of this to anybody.

866
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:04,603
Keep me informed, Doctor.

867
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:05,603
I'll be in my office.

868
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:06,903
All right, Colonel.

869
01:10:09,703 --> 01:10:10,803
Call the duty officer, Sergeant.

870
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:12,603
I want a guard posted
outside this door.

871
01:10:12,703 --> 01:10:14,003
This is now a restricted area.

872
01:10:14,103 --> 01:10:15,103
Yes, sir.

873
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:24,003
This is the office
of the Chief of Staff.

874
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:26,203
Connect me with Secretary
Lloyd Patterson's office.

875
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,303
Urgent.

876
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:18,403
<i>Trirene was dead.</i>

877
01:11:18,503 --> 01:11:21,003
<i>The Supreme gave me her ring.</i>

878
01:11:21,103 --> 01:11:24,003
<i>He showed me the way out
of the citadel.</i>

879
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:28,003
<i>I got to my plane, and...
That's all I remember.</i>

880
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:30,003
Thirty minutes later,
Allison brought the ship in

881
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:32,403
for an emergency landing.

882
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:34,603
Now the odd thing
about it is this...

883
01:11:34,703 --> 01:11:37,503
Right after he reported in
at, uh, Position Six...

884
01:11:40,703 --> 01:11:42,203
Major Allison is feeling
much better.

885
01:11:42,303 --> 01:11:44,603
Good.

886
01:11:44,703 --> 01:11:46,403
Mr. Secretary, General,

887
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:49,403
as you know, Bill Allison
is our leading research pilot

888
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,203
here at the test center.

889
01:11:51,303 --> 01:11:53,603
We've always considered him
fully competent

890
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:54,703
and rational.

891
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,603
Dr. Richman and I have
been with him

892
01:11:57,703 --> 01:12:00,003
for the past eight hours.

893
01:12:00,103 --> 01:12:01,803
Dr. Richman and I are convinced

894
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:03,803
that he is as mentally sound
right now

895
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,403
as any normal,
well-balanced person can be.

896
01:12:06,503 --> 01:12:08,203
I suggest we go in.

897
01:12:08,303 --> 01:12:09,903
Mr. Secretary, General...

898
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,603
Mr. Secretary.

899
01:12:30,703 --> 01:12:31,703
Thank you.

900
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:36,903
How 'bout it, kid?
Feel like talking?

901
01:12:38,503 --> 01:12:39,703
I'm ready, Colonel.

902
01:12:41,103 --> 01:12:42,003
Now, if you feel like
you need more room,

903
01:12:42,103 --> 01:12:43,903
just say so.

904
01:12:44,103 --> 01:12:45,103
Yeah, okay.

905
01:12:50,903 --> 01:12:52,703
Any questions, gentlemen?

906
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,103
Mr. Patterson?

907
01:12:57,703 --> 01:13:00,003
No, I... I don't believe so.

908
01:13:00,103 --> 01:13:02,803
The plague... The cosmic plague!

909
01:13:02,903 --> 01:13:04,003
None of us should go through it.

910
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:06,003
We've got to prevent it.

911
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:07,403
Prevent what, son?

912
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:08,603
The cosmic plague!

913
01:13:08,703 --> 01:13:10,603
Marty, we've got to stop it!

914
01:13:10,703 --> 01:13:13,803
Mr. Secretary,
from Intelligence.

915
01:13:13,903 --> 01:13:15,203
They've run a check
on Professor Bourman

916
01:13:15,303 --> 01:13:17,203
and Karl Kruse.

917
01:13:17,303 --> 01:13:20,003
Kruse is enrolled
in a West German university.

918
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:22,603
He's a leading student
in astronautics.

919
01:13:22,703 --> 01:13:24,403
And Bourman,
another student of physics

920
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:26,203
and mathematics in Amsterdam.

921
01:13:26,303 --> 01:13:28,803
He's written papers
on new propulsion systems

922
01:13:28,903 --> 01:13:30,643
that have astounded
the scientific world.

923
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,303
Colonel Martin...

924
01:13:38,903 --> 01:13:41,203
This is Trirene's ring...

925
01:13:41,303 --> 01:13:42,903
The Supreme gave me.

926
01:13:56,903 --> 01:13:59,503
Gentlemen, we have got
a lot to think about.
