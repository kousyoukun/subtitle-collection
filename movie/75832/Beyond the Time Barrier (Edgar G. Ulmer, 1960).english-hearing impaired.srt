00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,826
Your society?

163
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,495
Yes, you see,

164
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:57,789
we here in our citadel,

165
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:00,250
save for my captain and myself,

166
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,877
are deaf-mutes.

167
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:05,855
Even my own grandchild, Trirene.

168
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:09,609
Deaf-mutes?

169
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,862
You mean, everybody?

170
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:22,897
I don't understand.

171
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,482
There will be time
for understanding,

172
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,734
if you are cooperative.

173
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,337
Now, tell us of your nation.

174
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:34,242
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir, I'm sorry.

175
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:35,952
You know very well
what we're talking about.

176
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:39,080
You're not the first spy
we've ever captured.

177
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,374
What do you mean, "Spy"?

178
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:44,143
I asked some simple questions.
I expect some simple answers.

179
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,815
I want some answers.

180
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,385
What is this you're wearing?

181
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,153
This symbol... What is this?

182
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,532
New devices to deceive us,
my Master.

183
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,518
We have seen such guises before.

184
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:02,645
They do not fool us.

185
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,206
It would be wise to tell us
all you know.

186
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,486
I'm Major William Allison,
United States Air Force, sir.

187
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:13,740
Serial number 03564629.

188
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,362
That's all I'm required
to tell you.

189
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,703
I will use other measures,
Supreme.

190
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,371
I will get to the truth.

191
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:22,707
Wait, Captain.

192
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,376
Major, we have saved your life.

193
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,629
You could have been
captured by the mutants.

194
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,799
Won't you cooperate with us?

195
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,885
With your permission, sir.

196
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:36,095
What was your purpose
in coming here?

197
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:37,638
I don't have any purpose.

198
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:40,475
You lie, you were spying on
our solar energy installation.

199
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:41,934
How did you find us?

200
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,978
Find you? I don't even
know where I am.

201
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:45,813
You're searching for
Karl Kruse and Dr. Bourman.

202
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:46,981
You're one of them, aren't you?

203
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,733
I never heard of them!

204
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,569
Where are your people living?

205
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:52,904
Would you really
like to know, Captain?

206
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,697
Yes, of course I want to know!

207
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:57,200
Well, at this very minute,
I don't know myself.

208

Captain...

209
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:01,245
He's impossible.

210
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:02,847
You're one of the scapes.
Admit it.

211
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:06,876
I'm an officer of
the United States Air Force.

212
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:10,213
I'd like someone to tell me
something that makes some sense!

213
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:13,132
Other nations, mutants...
What kind of talk is this?

214
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:15,968
He is very clever, my Supreme,
but I have a plan.

215
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,570
I can use him to our advantage.

216
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:25,019
Trirene does not approve
of your plan, Captain.

217
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,497
She has found some truth
in the major's thoughts.

218
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,568
I do not trust him,
especially his thoughts.

219
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:34,921
Even Trirene could be deceived.

220
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:42,078
Follow through with
your plan, Captain.

221
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,179
Yes, Master.

222
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,416
It will be done.

It appears you have more
than the usual interest

226
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,945
in this young Captain, Trirene.

227
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,949
He's very young-

228
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,994
This young man is an enemy.

229
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,372
We must be very careful.

230
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:16,128

I'm very sorry.

before I express them, so...

You know I'm going to ask you
about Karl Kruse.

00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:40,698
Is he here in the citadel?

00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,894
Look, would you take me to him?

335
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:45,978
I think if I can
get to Karl Kruse,

he can help me
understand all this.

Since this morning.

Well, I'm not certain.
I don't know.

here in the citadel, I fear.

Trirene informs me
that you have been here

Major Allison, what year
was your flight in?

I told you, today...
This morning.

No, I don't know...
I don't know where I am

Maybe when you find out
what she has on hers,

Then, if it wasn't nuclear
war, what did cause it?

Well, heh, the danger is
in the other extreme.

since the very first
A-bomb test.

466
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:56,056
That dust has remained up there,

467
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:59,810
and it's slowly destroying

that have ever taken place
on Earth

474
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:13,615

Yes.

476

And every human being left

Or sterile...
Or a combination of both.

then Colonel Martin

479

What's happened to them?

How can I find out?

482
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,715
There isn't any way.

483

evacuation began

488
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:40,726
to the planet colonies.

489
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:43,562
Only the uninfected ones
were permitted to go.

490
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:45,272
The ones left behind
moved underground

491
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:47,858
as fast as possible
and started building

492
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:50,277
networks of tunnels...
Like this one.

493
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,195
More than half the population
of the world was wiped out

494
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:54,197
during the first year.

495
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:56,366
I see.

496
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:59,036
When I landed on the air base,

497
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:01,496
it was completely destroyed,
demolished.

498
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:02,956
Deserted.

499
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:04,666
You landed? You didn't crash?

- MARKOVA: The captain!

501
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:07,961
When they found you,
they destroyed your ship?

502
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:09,963
No, no... I left the air base.

503
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:12,174
They captured me afterwards.

504
00:36:12,274 --> 00:36:14,134
Then your plane is in
operating condition,

505
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:15,886
sitting out there
on the air base?

506
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:17,512
Well, I suppose so.

507
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,004
Unless the mutants
have found it.

508
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:28,398
Well, Kruse, I see you've
become acquainted

509
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:29,900
with our new prisoner.

510
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
Yes, Captain.

511
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,987
And it is your good fortune,
as well as ours,

512
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,490
Major Allison has an excellent
technical background

513
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,200
and he's eager to help us.

514
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,118
And, as you know, Captain,
we are in dire need

515
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:41,828
of skilled help.

516
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:43,138
Well, we shall see.

517
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:46,500
Where's Trirene?

518
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,669
I believe she's returned
to her chambers, Captain.

519
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,480
I think she's expecting
a visitor.

520
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:54,716
Come along with me, Major.

521
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:56,693
We have some things to discuss.

no more of your scheming.

524

If you persist, I'll see that
you're back in the dungeon.

525
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:30,001
We've got to get to the major
before they convince him

526
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,253
we're his enemies.

I am not a scientist.

My concern is a military one.

I must save the last

Then it is true...
Your society is doomed.

Major Allison, I must warn you.

534

Karl Kruse and his group
are shrewd.

They'll use you... They're
the most dangerous scapes

It would be wise for you
not to associate with them.

Come, I'll show you

do nothing that will
bring harm to her.

You don't, but Kruse
and Bourman do.

What phenomenon
did bring me here?

606
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:27,817
It is what we know
as a relativity paradox.

607
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:30,987
It's another dimension,
a fifth dimension.

Fifth dimension?

609
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:34,949
Professor Bourman's principle
of gravitation propulsion

610
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:36,534
brought it about.

611

The speed of light?

614
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:47,712
I thought 10,000 miles an hour
was fast.

(CHUCKLING) Yes, but there
is a pitfall

in the system.

617
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:52,884
At speeds approaching
that of light,

618
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:55,845
it is possible to break

to each other.

621

That's what
happened to all of us.

622
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:04,687
We have slipped out
of one time sphere

623
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:05,814
and into another.

624

Captain Markova
broke through in 1973

625
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,027
during her third flight.

626
00:44:11,127 --> 00:44:13,613

628

The captain's men
destroyed her ship.

629
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,204
It happened to Kruse and I
years later.

630
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:22,956
We had returned to earth
for an observation flight

631
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:24,833
in 1994.

632
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:26,251
Our ship crashed.

633
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:29,003
1994?

634
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:30,713
But the speed I approached
in the X-80

635
00:44:30,813 --> 00:44:32,715
was nowhere near
the speed of light.

636
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:33,925
That may be.

637
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:35,051
But it was just enough

638
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:38,221
to create certain
mathematical conditions.

639
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:40,807
Let me show you.

640
00:44:40,907 --> 00:44:46,479
Here, these symbols
represent the earth,

641

642
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,819
Now, consider these known facts.

643
00:44:52,919 --> 00:44:55,947
The earth is rotating
at 1,000 miles per hour.

644
00:44:56,047 --> 00:44:59,284
But it is also revolving
in orbit around the sun

645
00:44:59,384 --> 00:45:02,078
at 66,000 miles per hour.

646
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:04,205

647
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:07,375
is relative to these movements.

648
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:09,878
But the entire solar system,

649
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:12,130
together with other systems
of our galaxy,

650
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,926
are moving through space at
over six million miles per hour.

651
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:18,928
Theoretically,
you had a velocity

652
00:45:19,028 --> 00:45:22,140
approaching the speed of light
before you ever left the ground.

653
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,058
Yes, but everything is moving
at that speed together,

654
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:26,352
as one unit...
The air, the earth,

655
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:27,937
according to the law of gravity.

656
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:30,481
Time is not affected
by the laws of gravity.

657
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:32,275
This is what happened to you.

658
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,611
At some point during
your high-speed flight,

659
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:36,988
you approached escape velocity,

660
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:39,324
Twenty-five thousand
miles per hour.

661
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:42,744
It was at this time that you
altered your flight angle.

662
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:45,455
If you hadn't, probably you
would have gone on into orbit.

663
00:45:45,555 --> 00:45:49,125
It was this angle at a
specific altitude and velocity

664
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:51,044
that broke the time barrier.

665
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:53,838
For a fraction of a second,
you were suspended in space,

666
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,381
no longer interlocked
with the time spheres

667
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:57,383
of the sun and the earth.

668
00:45:57,483 --> 00:46:00,720
Now, during this split second,
our galaxy moved onward in time

669
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,389
for what amounted to 65 years.

670
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:06,768
An instant later, you had
rejoined our solar system,

671
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:08,394
and the rest you know.

672
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:10,480
Yes.

673
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,775
Then, if I repeat
the altitude, angle of flight,

674
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,945
and speed, in directly
the opposite direction,

675
00:46:17,045 --> 00:46:19,155
I should go back into time
65 years.

676
00:46:19,255 --> 00:46:20,323
Mmm-hmm.

677

(DRONING)

678
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:24,494
Precisely.

679
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:26,621
Dr. Bourman is working
on the formula.

680
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,790
The three factors must be exact.

681
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,583
Then we must locate
an escape from the citadel,

682
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:32,669
- so I can find my ship.
- Right.

683
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,420
We must obtain an early map
of the citadel

684
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,381
with the tunnel work.

685
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:38,716
Your air base surely
must be included.

686
00:46:38,816 --> 00:46:41,970
They began construction
as early as 1972.

687
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,014
The maps are on file
at the Supreme's chamber.

688
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:47,600
There is only one way
to get them, Major.

689
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,143
You mean Trirene?

690
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:51,771
- That's the only way.
- No.

691
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:53,982
No, I won't turn her
against her own people.

692
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,441
You have to do it.

693

Very well...

696
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:06,761
I'll do it.

697
00:47:08,304 --> 00:47:09,831
You stay here.

698
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:11,349
I'll find my way back.

Trirene, I've got
to have your help.

702
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:45,343
It's very difficult for me
to know what to do,

703
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:46,487
but there's something...

704
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,394
What would I do without you?

705
00:49:22,855 --> 00:49:25,341
Trirene...

706
00:49:25,441 --> 00:49:28,845
Tell me you know
I'm doing the right thing.

707
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:30,888
I've got to try and go back.

708
00:49:30,988 --> 00:49:32,423
You do understand that,
don't you?

709
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:38,980
There won't have to be
any citadel.

710
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,857
You and your people can live
on the surface of the earth

711
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:43,000
without fear of any
cosmic plague.

They're waiting.

713
00:50:14,991 --> 00:50:17,018
I made this tracing
from the original map.

714
00:50:17,118 --> 00:50:18,811
Then Trirene returned it
to the archives.

715
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:19,912
Here, let me show you.

716
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:24,650
Now... Here's the citadel.

717
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,070
I remember a wooded area
and a hill.

718
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,156
The solar antenna
was atop the hill.

719
00:50:30,256 --> 00:50:33,826
They must have hit me with
that paralyzing ray about here.

720
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:37,246
This outlet must be
Perimeter 22-B.

721
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:38,956
Here's the highway...
If I can find that,

722
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:40,791
I can follow it directly
to the air base.

723
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:42,501
We need the gun we have hidden.

724
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:43,961
- And your flight suit.
- Yes.

725
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,671
What about
the time lock formula?

726
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:46,881

If nothing goes wrong, Allison,

00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:59,936
you can be on your way
within a few hours.

730
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:01,646
It should be no great problem.

00:51:01,746 --> 00:51:03,873
Trirene will lead us
by the guards.

It's another one
of their devices

737
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:40,226
to prevent us
from watching them.

They're planning an escape,
and I know it.

00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:45,189
I'll put a stop to this scheme.

there is hope, Master.

in what they say.

could return to a time

01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:52,597
Any questions, gentlemen?

971
01:12:54,932 --> 01:12:56,017
Mr. Patterson?

972
01:12:57,685 --> 01:13:00,046
No, I... I don't believe so.

973
01:13:00,146 --> 01:13:02,840
The plague... The cosmic plague!

974
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,050
None of us should go through it.

975
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,010
We've got to prevent it.

976
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,428
Prevent what, son?

977
01:13:07,528 --> 01:13:08,513
The cosmic plague!

978
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:10,640
Marty, we've got to stop it!

979
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,810
Mr. Secretary,
from Intelligence.

980
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:15,186
They've run a check
on Professor Bourman

981
01:13:15,286 --> 01:13:17,188
and Karl Kruse.

982
01:13:17,288 --> 01:13:20,024
Kruse is enrolled
in a West German university.

983
01:13:20,124 --> 01:13:22,527
He's a leading student
in astronautics.

984
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:24,362
And Bourman,
another student of physics

985
01:13:24,462 --> 01:13:26,239
and mathematics in Amsterdam.

986
01:13:26,339 --> 01:13:28,825
He's written papers
on new propulsion systems

987
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:30,665
that have astounded
the scientific world.

988
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:33,221
Colonel Martin...

989
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:41,254
This is Trirene's ring...

990
01:13:41,354 --> 01:13:42,855
The Supreme gave me.

991
01:13:56,911 --> 01:13:59,539
Gentlemen, we have got
a lot to think about.
