1
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:52,765
Jesus! He's got my purse!

2
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,129
Stop him!

3
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,449
Hey, you! Come back here!

4
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,045
Yo.

5
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:30,724
Come on.

6
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,685
You got it all?

7
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:46,850
Everything.

8
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,005
Damn.

9
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,045
We're rich.

10
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:12,133
You hear that? We're rich, man.

11
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,605
Ma?

12
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,051
I'm with a friend.

13
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:14,249
You certainly are.

14
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,605
I gotta take care of some business.

15
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,169
I gotta see my stockbroker.

16
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:52,053
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

17
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,612
Out with Paco.

18
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:56,649
You're going to bed right now!
That's where you're going.

19
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:57,729
No.

20
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:02,886
Yo, listen to her, all right?
I'll take you out tomorrow, okay?

21
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,205
All right.

22
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:22,648
Honey, can you turn it down a little?

23
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,773
Paco, your old man.

24
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:19,849
Look, I don't want a job. I want a business.

25
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,765
We deliver Saturday night, 9:00.

26
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,925
Parking lot around the corner
from the Marshall theater.

27
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,048
All you guys gotta do is...

28
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,129
Paco!

29
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:07,484
Put it down!

30
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,412
Put it down!

31
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,489
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

32
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,168
Why you fucking with me?

33
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,652
Let me tell you something.

34
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:22,806
You pull any shit like this Saturday night,
I swear to God...

35
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:27,849
Look, man, I'm not playing with you.
You hear me?

36
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,764
Get the fuck out of here!

37
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:36,125
Barn!

38
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,448
Hey, J.C.

39
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:19,648
Carl.

40
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:28,453
I've never seen so much shit in my life.
They got a fucking drugstore.

41
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,049
How're you doing, J.C.?

42
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:37,445
What do you see in this guy, huh?

43
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,129
Fuck off, Moreno.

44
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:43,848
Your old lady's got a bad mouth.
If she was my old lady...

45
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:46,005
- She's not, asshole.
- Oh, wow.

46
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,768
You mean she didn't tell you
about me and her, huh?

47
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,645
Don't listen to that stupid...

48
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:54,132
Adios, douche bag.

49
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,932
Hey, wake up.

50
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,288
- I gotta get up. I gotta go.
- No.

51
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:50,209
Your old man will be back soon. I gotta go.

52
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,165
Mick.

53
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,004
Remember Tony Contreras?

54
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,691
- Who?
- The guy with the bike.

55
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:25,245
He got killed ripping off some house
in Park Ridge last week.

56
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,412
That guy?

57
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:30,333
That's the way it goes.

58
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:33,725
I had this dream that you went away.

59
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,529
SO did I.

60
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:37,564
With you.

61
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,609
I went over to your house looking for you.

62
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:44,852
Your mother opened the door.
She didn't say anything, so I went inside.

63
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:48,768
And there you were,
lying in this coffin in a red suit.

64
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:53,051
I don't have a red suit.

65
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:56,931
You have the strangest dreams.

66
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,212
What were you and Brennan talking about?

67
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:01,085
Carl? Nothing.

68
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:04,165
Nothing!

69
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:05,765
Someday

70
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,329
you're gonna get busted for real.

71
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:11,489
So what? They don't do shit.
You know what they do?

72
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:14,804
They take you down there
and they give you lunch.

73
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:18,684
Then, they're gonna call my old lady.
They're not gonna find her.

74
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,932
Send me home for her supper,
which isn't as good as their lunch.

75
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:23,004
It's a joke.

76
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:24,728
I don't want you to die.

77
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,852
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

78
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:29,604
I love you.

79
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:43,572
Don't dream.

80
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:50,885
Are you sure they won't know who we are?

81
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,328
Not if you do what I say.

82
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:56,005
You keep your fucking mouth shut,

83
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:58,689
they won't know shit.

84
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,644
Jesus.

85
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,885
Don't be such a pussy.

86
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:23,325
We're gonna be in and out of there so fast...

87
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,128
You're not gonna have to use that.

88
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:27,371
Like that.

89
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,244
What are you doing in here?

90
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:23,573
You promised me I can go out with you.

91
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:27,685
Yeah. Not tonight.

92
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:31,005
We got something to do, it's very important.

93
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:33,088
I don't want you in the way.

94
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:37,604
I'll take you to a movie.
Tomorrow, we'll go out, we'll hang out.

95
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:40,204
All right? Right now, you go home.

96
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:42,092
But you promised.

97
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,205
Man, don't play with me.
I'm not playing with you. Stop it.

98
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:46,008
Go home. Get out of here.

99
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,492
Just make sure them guns are ready,
all right?

100
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,812
Believe me, they're going to be ready.

101
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,324
Check this out, man.

102
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:23,492
Bad motherfucker.

103
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,045
There's Moreno's kid brother.

104
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:46,289
Relax, Carl. It's gonna be all right.

105
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,411
Okay.

106
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,011
There they are.

107
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:02,851
Let's go.

108
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,484
Rough neighborhood.

109
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:16,371
Slow down, slow down.

110
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:17,404
I'm slowing down.

111
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,251
There's the boys. Right there.

112
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,332
Party time now.

113
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,844
Okay, over here. Carl, over here.

114
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,011
Okay, okay.

115
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,083
Okay.

116
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:45,404
- Shit. What's with the dude?
- Hey, man. He got a gun.

117
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,728
- Get his ass, man. Get him.
- Go.

118
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,691
Mick, look out!

119
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:00,524
Hold up, man.

120
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:02,848
We got to move.

121
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:04,964
Let's go!

122
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,131
Let's go! Let's go!

123
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:23,408
Carl! Carl!

124
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:49,727
We heard shots.

125
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:15,207
Fuck!

126
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,005
Fuck!

127
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,371
Don't move, in there!

128
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,131
Michael O'Brien,

129
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:40,132
you have committed the crimes of an adult.

130
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,644
Your previous record of arrests is extensive

131
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,487
and indicates a sociopathic personality.

132
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:51,168
However; you are protected by the law.

133
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,212
Your status as a juvenile prevents me

134
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:56,571
from imposing the punishment you deserve.

135
00:20:57,164 --> 00:21:00,612
And until our criminal codes
are revised to incorporate

136
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:04,129
a more realistic definition
of juvenile offenders,

137
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:06,252
society will continue to suffer

138
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,964
It is the judgment of this court

139
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:13,645
that you be committed to
Rainford Juvenile Correctional Facility

140
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:17,452
until such a time
as your rehabilitation is complete.

141
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:58,052
Terrell, O'Brien, let's go.

142
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:23,245
Welcome to Rainford, gentlemen.

143
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,691
My name is Gene Daniels.
I'm one of your supervisors.

144
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:29,924
Call me Mr. Daniels. I like that.
Don't call me anything else.

145
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:33,844
You've been assigned to Dorm C.

146
00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:37,008
That's our special circumstances dormitory

147
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:39,092
for critical offenders.

148
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,408
Your fellow inmates are murderers,

149
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:44,771
armed robbers, rapists,

150
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,572
and mental defectives.

151
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:50,212
Just like yourselves,
they've graduated top of the class.

152
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,765
You will be treated with respect
if you treat others with respect.

153
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:57,608
I suggest you stay cool
and follow all the rules.

154
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:03,692
Your crime is not that you got caught,

155
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:05,805
but the crime itself.

156
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,207
Remember that.

157
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,404
Hopefully, you will realize
that what you did was wrong.

158
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:17,688
Hopefully, you will never do
anything like that again.

159
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,524
This is a juvenile facility.

160
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:27,128
That means you are not
in charge of the zoo, we are.

161
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:29,851
If you think you're hip, you're not.

162
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:33,408
If you were, you wouldn't be here.

163
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:36,248
Have I made myself understood?

164
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,848
"Yes, Mr. Daniels."

165
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,412
- Yes, Mr. Daniels.
- Yes, Mr. Daniels.

166
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:45,852
That's better.

167
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,328
Let's go, gentlemen.

168
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:03,964
Wagner.

00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,372
YMCA time!

170
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:15,968
Hey, check them out!

171
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,604
- Over here!
- Hey, beautiful.

172
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:35,331
Little one's cute.

173
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,247
O'Brien. Hey.

174
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,845
All right. This is Supervisor Wagner.

175
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:52,284
"Sir" will also do.

176
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:53,652
O'Brien. Terrell.

177
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:57,007
Gentlemen, enjoy your rehabilitation.

178
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:01,044
Hey, the man is over here.

179
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:05,487
You boys read?

180
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,208
Read this.

181
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:10,571
Gang activity, 1,000 points.

182
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:13,084
Sexual harassment, 1 ,200.

183
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:16,444
Fighting, 700. Drugs and/or alcohol, 1,500.

184
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:19,732
Running for the fence, 2,000. Smoking, 400.

185
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,524
Okay, Terrell, you take room number 35
up on top,

186
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,804
and, O'Brien,
you take room number 14 on the bottom.

187
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:29,930
Come on, let's go!

188
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:36,284
Hey, check it out. It's Batman and Robin.

189
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,051
I want the little dude.

190
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,848
So, how do you like it so far?

191
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,288
You got a name?

192
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:47,571
Can you talk?

193
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:54,690
Smoke?

194
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:02,727
My name is Horowitz.

195
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,484
You don't feel like talking
right now, that's okay.

196
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:05,884
I understand.

197
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:09,611
But you understand I really don't
want a fucking mute in my cell.

198
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:11,971
'Cause I like a little conversation
sometimes, okay?

199
00:27:18,124 --> 00:27:20,207
Last guy that was in here with me
killed himself

200
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:22,083
by drinking a half a gallon of disinfectant,

201
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,883
he liked the place so much.

202
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:33,887
My name is O'Brien.

203
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,048
Shit. A fucking mick.

204
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:24,804
No!

205
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:30,803
No.

206
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,124
So, what's the toke?

207
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:00,604
An accident.

208
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,128
Yeah, me, too.

209
00:29:03,003 --> 00:29:06,004
I firebombed the bowling alley,
killed three people.

210
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:10,172
I was goofing around with some girls.
Their boyfriends didn't like it too much,

211
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,011
beat the shit out of me.

212
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,888
Came back the next night, totaled the place.

213
00:29:16,603 --> 00:29:19,604
Only thing was,
I wasted the wrong three people.

214
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:32,324
Well, time to get counted.

215
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:36,448
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:43,571
Get in line, asshole.

217
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,968
- Just get in line. Get in line.
- That's Lofgren.

218
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,883
They can him "Viking."

219
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:53,011
I Call him "Shit-for-brains."

220
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,571
Shut your fucking mouth, Horowitz.

221
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,844
Come on, get in line. Let's go, let's go.
Come on, wake up, wake up.

222
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:04,090
- Get in line, get in line.
- Get in line, man.

223
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,847
Get in line, get in line. Come on.

224
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,727
Get in line, man.

225
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:12,964
You, too, man. Move! Get in line!

226
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:17,051
Come on, move it, move it.
Let's get in line. You, too.

227
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,131
That's Tweety.

228
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:23,492
Nice name.

229
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:33,811
They're smacks.

230
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:38,411
They keep the rest of the animals in line
and give out the work assignments.

231
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:41,451
They're gonna put you on shithouse patrol.

232
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:45,164
All accounted for, Mr. Daniels.

233
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:48,087
All right, that's five minutes to first bell.

234
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:49,891
Five minutes.

235
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,691
What happened to your face?

236
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,203
Hey, fuckhead!

237
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,684
What's it to you?

238
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,244
I asked you a question.

239
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,244
I cut myself shaving.

240
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:05,284
I got news for you, fuckhead.

241
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,611
In here, me and him,

242
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:10,846
we're it.

243
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:16,331
You're on shithouse patrol
until we say different. You got it?

244
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:09,083
Clean it up.

245
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,163
Smokes?

246
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:47,007
Winstone, Pall Malls, Salems.

247
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,287
Salems.

248
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,171
Ten bucks.

249
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:55,683
I don't have it.

250
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:57,570
Take it or leave it.

251
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:01,124
Perretti, you want your radio fixed?
Give him the smokes.

252
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:03,803
Horowitz, you suck!

253
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:06,327
Only your mother, Perretti.

254
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:14,924
Grass? You need some grass, I got it.

255
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:16,644
Don't buy it. It's shit.

256
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:27,411
Horowitz, you better have it ready by Friday.

257
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:30,163
Or your ass is grass.

258
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:31,647
Don't worry about it.

259
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:51,363
The chink killed his father.

260
00:34:51,363 --> 00:34:53,327
The whop snatched a 14-year-old girl

261
00:34:53,403 --> 00:34:55,967
and raped her for two days straight
in a basement.

262
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:59,803
They run the action for the Viking
and Tweety on a 60-40 split.

263
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:02,050
Real cuties.

264
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:14,524
Ain't he sweet.

265
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:32,283
All right, guys, loosen up a little bit.

266
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:43,330
How you doing?

267
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:46,531
Not too good.
They're gonna get me, Mick. I know it.

268
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:09,084
I'll be right back.

269
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,290
I wrote Mick today.

270
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,771
Started at least 10 times.

271
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,607
You know, "How are you?
What's it like there?"

272
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,963
That kind of thing.

273
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:30,731
Everything sounded so dumb.

274
00:36:33,882 --> 00:36:36,010
Honey, listen to me.

275
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:39,686
He's a bad kid.

276
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:43,363
He's been in and out of trouble for years.

277
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:44,927
Now, he's finally gone and killed someone.

278
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,047
No.

279
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:49,211
It was an accident.

280
00:36:57,243 --> 00:37:01,084
I see you're responsible
for the death of an eight-year-old boy.

281
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:05,011
It was an accident.

282
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:08,163
An accident.

283
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:11,283
How about these other charges?

284
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,403
"Driving a stolen vehicle,
assault with a deadly weapon,

285
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,163
"attempted robbery."

286
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,287
I suppose they were accidents, too.

287
00:37:20,403 --> 00:37:23,807
Possession of a handgun
and assaulting a teacher at 12.

288
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:28,930
Four counts of vandalism,
three counts of breaking and entering at 13.

289
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:34,171
Assaulting a 70-year-old woman
during a purse snatching at 14.

290
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:37,047
You're a real class act.

291
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,003
You want me to go on?

292
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:45,452
How you never did any time here before

293
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:46,843
is a miracle.

294
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:50,651
And now you're telling me
what just happened was an accident?

295
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:53,407
Hey, boy,

296
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,442
let me tell you something.

297
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:00,367
That was no accident.

298
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,087
You would've killed somebody
sooner or later.

299
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:07,083
Only it happened sooner, you see?

300
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:10,290
So, don't bullshit yourself.
Don't bullshit me.

301
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,451
How do you feel about what went down?

302
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:23,130
About the so-called accident?

303
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:29,323
I'd like an answer.

304
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:31,726
I don't have one.

305
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:36,331
Well, when you do have an answer,
let me know.

306
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,687
Because I'm interested.

307
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,571
Anytime you wanna talk about this,

308
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,843
or anything else,

309
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:50,043
I'm here.

310
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,847
Thank you, Eddie.

311
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:57,530
Gerard!

312
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:01,527
- Holden!
- Right here.

313
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:06,050
Jones! Is there anybody here
by the name of Jones?

314
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:10,684
Perretti!

315
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:15,003
Johnson!

316
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:19,010
- O'Brien!
- Yeah.

317
00:39:19,803 --> 00:39:22,771
Fucking miracle
someone you know can write.

318
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,366
Jones!

319
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,403
Turn around.

320
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:49,202
Come on, man. Come on.

321
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,483
Hey, Paco, that's him.

322
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:07,166
That's the one.

323
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:08,762
That's the guy.

324
00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:14,570
Hey, what was that?

325
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:16,646
Someone wasted Willy, man!

326
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,486
Get the license plate, man.
Get the license plate!

327
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:22,324
Somebody call an ambulance.

328
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,203
Man, that's a lot of blood.

329
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:26,563
Man, he's bleeding bad, man.
He's bleeding bad!

330
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,323
Jimmy, come here!

331
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:30,571
Oh, man! Guess he's dead.

332
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:23,923
What do you want?

333
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,963
Just get the fuck out of here!
Leave me alone!

334
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,090
Come on! Please, man!

335
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:58,683
How was it?

336
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:03,047
- Fucking asshole!
- Tweety! Tweety, he's got a knife!

337
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,490
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

338
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:25,603
- He's dead.
- He's dead?

339
00:42:26,283 --> 00:42:27,330
Let's get out of here.

340
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:29,843
Let's go, come on. Come on, let's go.

341
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:54,443
One way or the other,

342
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,167
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

343
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,643
You're on cooking detail all day.

344
00:43:03,802 --> 00:43:05,722
I'm gonna check with Axelrod.

345
00:43:05,722 --> 00:43:08,450
If you're lying to me,
I'm gonna deep-fry your ass.

346
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:12,883
Tell me exactly what happened
when you ran out on the tier. Exactly.

347
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:16,527
I just turned and
I saw a bunch of people out on the rail.

348
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:18,250
Who were the people next to you?

349
00:43:18,882 --> 00:43:22,887
So, you're telling me that
you don't remember if you saw anything?

350
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:24,927
Buy you... You were there, right?

351
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:27,966
Get out of here. Just get out of here.

352
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:33,730
Now, turn the chair around and sit down
and talk to me.

353
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:36,130
Now, where were you?

354
00:43:36,123 --> 00:43:37,727
I was in my room sleeping, like I told you.

355
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:39,243
No, you weren't.

356
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:46,410
- And that's all you can tell me?
- That's all.

357
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,363
All right.

358
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:50,923
You're up.

359
00:43:54,442 --> 00:43:57,803
I know, Lofgren, I know.
You're incurably innocent.

360
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:00,249
Yeah.

361
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,443
Okay.

362
00:44:10,842 --> 00:44:15,687
O'Brien, if you saw anything
that might help clear this up,

363
00:44:15,763 --> 00:44:18,087
it might knock some time off your sentence.

364
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:20,603
I can't help you, sir.

365
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:24,843
- That's it?
- Yeah, sir.

366
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:34,771
There are these three girls standing outside
the bowling alley, right?

367
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,003
I figure I'd give it a shot.

368
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:39,243
I walk over, I start talking to them.

369
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:44,567
Take off.

370
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,850
What'd you say to him?

371
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:02,843
Not much.

372
00:45:04,122 --> 00:45:06,370
When I ask you a question, you answer.
You dig, motherfucker?

373
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:08,447
- Go fuck yourself.
- I'm gonna fuck you up.

374
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:10,286
Hey, you got a problem?

375
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:19,206
Gentlemen, there's seconds
for those of you who want it.

376
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:21,970
Now, let's try to be dignified.

377
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:46,642
Mr. Wagner, here's the mop.

378
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:32,766
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. Get out of here.

379
00:47:37,242 --> 00:47:40,210
- Look, man, if there's gonna be trouble...
- it's okay.

380
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:05,042
Hey, sou m bag.

381
00:48:09,522 --> 00:48:10,569
Oh, shit.

382
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:16,606
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

383
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:40,610
Come on!

384
00:48:44,162 --> 00:48:45,405
Let's go!

385
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:31,446
Hi, J.C.

386
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:13,286
Hey.

387
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:16,566
- You feel it?
- What?

388
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:18,963
You're it.

389
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:21,129
What are you talking about?

390
00:50:21,202 --> 00:50:23,647
You're the new barn boss, O'Brien.

391
00:50:23,642 --> 00:50:24,766
Says who?

392
00:50:24,762 --> 00:50:26,562
Hey, it is what it is.

393
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:28,006
Fuck that.

394
00:50:28,002 --> 00:50:29,082
What are you afraid of?

395
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,366
I ain't afraid of anything.
I just don't want to be it.

396
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:34,410
Hey, after what you did to
Viking and Tweety, man, you're it.

397
00:50:36,442 --> 00:50:37,446
Hey, schmuck.

398
00:50:37,522 --> 00:50:39,846
- What?
- Think of it as a present.

399
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:41,001
Some present.

400
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:43,690
Barn boss gets 40 % of the cigarette action.

401
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:45,322
You forgot.

402
00:50:45,402 --> 00:50:49,210
Barn boss gets to give out
the work assignments and take his own.

403
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:53,122
Barn boss gets time off his sentence
if he stays cool

404
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:55,522
and keeps the Neanderthals in line.

405
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,087
You didn't know that, did you?
Think you can handle it?

406
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:04,610
And as your lieutenant,
I get some privileges, too.

407
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:12,290
Banzai!

408
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:16,202
Every week,

409
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:21,130
two cartons for me

410
00:51:22,922 --> 00:51:24,646
and two for Horowitz.

411
00:51:26,442 --> 00:51:27,522
Free.

412
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:33,727
There's something else.

413
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:41,402
You know how it used to be a 60-40 split?

414
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:44,722
Well, it Still is.

415
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,883
Only now, it's 60-40.

416
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:56,442
Get out of here.

417
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,046
Hey, man.

418
00:52:31,802 --> 00:52:33,722
You're something else, O'Brien.

419
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:37,246
- Mick.
- You're it, man.

420
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:41,489
- Excuse me. Make way for the man.
- You're it now.

421
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,650
Go ahead, O'Brien.

422
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:53,602
What is that shit?

423
00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:56,287
"Poise and control."

424
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:57,765
Oh, God.

425
00:52:59,682 --> 00:53:01,526
- Shut up.
- Shoot.

426
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:04,170
- Shut up.
- You don't know nothing.

427
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:05,242
Be cool.

428
00:53:06,202 --> 00:53:08,690
Perretti, read the sentence to the class.

429
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:11,766
"The domi...

430
00:53:14,362 --> 00:53:15,966
"The dom... Dominant..."

431
00:53:17,162 --> 00:53:19,889
- The dumb what?
- "The dominant..."

432
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:22,362
- The dumb ass.
- "Primordial..."

433
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:24,806
- "The dominant..."
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Lofgren.

434
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:26,770
- Oh.
- "Dominant..."

435
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:30,166
- "Primer... Primer..."
- What?

436
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:33,282
- "Primer..."
- All right. O'Brien.

437
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:34,482
You try.

438
00:53:35,362 --> 00:53:38,526
- Come on, Mick.
- "The dominant prim..."

439
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:43,166
- You don't know...
- "Primer..."

440
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:47,849
Johnson. Read it.

441
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,882
Hey, look, this is nothing to laugh at.

442
00:53:53,962 --> 00:53:56,166
Now, maybe if some of you could read,
you wouldn't be in here.

443
00:53:56,762 --> 00:53:58,050
You ever think about that?

444
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:00,646
Look, you think of yourself as a moron,

445
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:03,209
you can't feel that good about yourself,
now, can you?

446
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:07,651
I just got back the results of that
literacy test you took, that reading test.

447
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,483
You should be in the third grade.

448
00:54:11,722 --> 00:54:13,162
All right. Yay.

449
00:54:13,242 --> 00:54:14,966
Well, I got my own reading test for you.

450
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:18,250
I want you to read the comic book
I'm gonna give you

451
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:20,041
and write a report on it.

452
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:21,530
- Shit.
- Oh, man.

453
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,890
All right. I want you to write about
the characters and the storyline.

454
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,082
All right? Keep it simple.

455
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:29,966
What "line"?

456
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:31,841
Spelling, punctuation, they count.

457
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:34,683
Let's get started.
It's gotta be done this period.

458
00:54:34,682 --> 00:54:37,443
Sir, I don't think Lofgren can handle this.

459
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:39,289
- It's a little too advanced for him.
- Shut up.

460
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:40,449
All right.

461
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:42,529
I'm not telling you again.

462
00:54:44,002 --> 00:54:45,203
He has a mouth.

463
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:49,203
Well, let's go. Get to work.

464
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:57,490
More, Jew boy.

465
00:55:03,002 --> 00:55:04,769
That's a good little kike.

466
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:12,850
Hurry up.

467
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:16,565
What?

468
00:55:17,722 --> 00:55:20,810
What? Armstrong? Armstrong? Armstrong?

469
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:21,849
Can I have your spoon?

470
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,242
Mighty Mouse.

471
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:46,162
Horowitz!

472
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,209
Get off me! Move!

473
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,682
Get off me! Get out of the way!

474
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:13,170
Don't put... Don't put me inside there, man!

475
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:15,326
You can't put me in there! I hate solitary.

476
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:18,042
Man, don't put me in there alone!
I hate being alone!

477
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:21,122
Let me go. Let me go, you fucking asshole.
Let me go, man.

478
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:23,402
Don't put me in solitary. Fuck you.

479
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,401
Don't put me in solitary, man. Let me go.

480
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,162
Let me go. Don't put me in there, man.

481
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:28,846
That's it.

482
00:56:28,922 --> 00:56:31,650
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Don't do it! Get away from the door, man!

483
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:35,482
Can't someone... Hey, let me out.

484
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:43,323
You watch it, all right?
You can make all the noise you want now.

485
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:46,283
Let me out of here, you fucking asshole.

486
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,046
You can't keep me in here! Let me out!

487
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:29,728
Let's go.

488
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:20,441
Man, are you crazy?

489
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:25,762
Paco.

490
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:00,922
Let's go.

491
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:04,125
Hey, man, she saw your face.

492
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,841
I know.

493
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:08,962
Paco.

494
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:13,086
Do it.

495
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:27,281
Do it.

496
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:37,569
Hey. Get over here.

497
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,766
Hold it right there, buddy.

498
01:01:56,721 --> 01:01:58,849
We need your cooperation, J.C.

499
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:03,005
I know what you're going through.
Believe me.

500
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:07,329
But if you don't press charges,
this guy's gonna walk out of here.

501
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:09,849
Don't let that animal get away with this.

502
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,801
I wanna talk with Mick.

503
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:25,729
I don't get this shit.

504
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:33,329
Maybe you got some kind of
reading disability.

505
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:36,325
- Like what?
- Like you can't read.

506
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:38,846
O'Brien.

507
01:02:50,241 --> 01:02:51,201
Bye.

508
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:02,965
She'll be all right.

509
01:03:09,922 --> 01:03:12,409
What's going on inside you right now?

510
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:15,008
What do you feel?

511
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:23,601
I just feel like crying.

512
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,925
That's okay.

513
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:28,601
CW-

514
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,605
I've seen people cry before.

515
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:02,686
You're number one, number two,
number three, number four, number five.

516
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:05,249
Remember your numbers. Lieutenant.

517
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:23,682
Okay, number one. Turn around. Face me.
What's your name?

518
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:26,889
- Theodore Aparecia.
- Where do you live?

519
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:29,129
- 1872, South Racine.
- How old are you?

520
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:31,402
- Seventeen.
- Turn around. Face the wall.

521
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:33,926
Number two, turn around and face me.

522
01:04:34,002 --> 01:04:35,682
- What's your name?
- Richard DeLeon.

523
01:04:35,681 --> 01:04:38,288
- Where do you live?
- 2166, South Morgan.

524
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,802
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

525
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,721
Okay. Turn around and face the wall.

526
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:43,969
Number three, turn around and face me.

527
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:46,129
- What's your name?
- Paco Moreno.

528
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:47,481
That's him.

529
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:49,722
Never mind, miss. Hold on.
What's your address?

530
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:52,125
- That's him.
- 2395, Grand Avenue.

531
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,561
- How old are you?
- That's the one that raped me.

532
01:04:53,561 --> 01:04:55,241
Okay, turn around and face the wall.

533
01:04:57,081 --> 01:04:58,564
I'm sorry about J.C.

534
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:00,325
I really mean that.

535
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:04,965
I gotta see her.

536
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:08,046
They're not gonna let you
out of here, O'Brien.

537
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:10,365
Well, I'm not asking.

538
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:19,805
You want some company?

539
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:34,165
That's one. Stay, stay, stay.

540
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:40,129
- Throw it, dawg.
- Throw it, throw it.

541
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:43,481
We go straight through, right here.
We'll make it.

542
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:46,521
How do we get through this?

543
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:49,205
Leave it to Beaver.

544
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:04,168
I'm out of here next week.

545
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:06,925
Let's hope I don't see you again,
'cause if I do...

546
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:09,969
- I'll break your face all over again.
- We can start right now, chump.

547
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:11,646
What's the problem?

548
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:14,845
- No problem.
- No problem.

549
01:07:47,001 --> 01:07:48,245
Hey, Tweety.

550
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:55,846
Yeah. Tweety!

551
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:57,568
- Hey.
- What it is.

552
01:07:57,921 --> 01:07:59,045
Get him in here.

553
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,885
- You're right.
- Come over here, brother.

554
01:08:01,321 --> 01:08:02,522
Yo, what's up, man?

555
01:08:02,521 --> 01:08:04,125
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

556
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,568
Hey! Come on, let's go.

557
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:39,965
Keep moving. Let's go.

558
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,325
- What's the matter? You hurt?
- I twisted my ankle.

559
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:46,686
You're not hurt, Horowitz, come on.
Move on. Keep going.

560
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:54,688
- All right, all right, let's go.
- Hey, watch deep right.

561
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,044
- Throw the ball.
- Get out of the way, man.

562
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:05,089
Go, go, go, go!

563
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:09,485
- You ready?
- Yeah.

564
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,440
Back of the line.

565
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:24,121
- Don't dance.
- All right, give it back, baby.

566
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:28,448
Oh, man. Hey, wait. Now, get over here!

567
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:29,849
Call signal six.

568
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:24,765
Hey, get this shit off me!

569
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,881
Oh, fuck!

570
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,401
Wagner! Come on, man.
I hear them over here.

571
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:33,721
Go.

572
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:35,401
Go!

573
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:42,368
Oh, shit.

574
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:46,522
I can't get this off me.

575
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:48,449
Stupid shit!

576
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,201
Fuck you, pig.

577
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,605
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Wagner, man!

578
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:55,965
Wagner! Wagner!

579
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,961
Wait! Leave the kid alone, man!

580
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,245
What's wrong with you?

581
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,165
O'Brien is gone, man. You let him get away!

582
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,685
Mick.

583
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,448
No.

584
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,364
One minute, one minute.

585
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,684
O'Brien.

586
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:07,845
Let's go, man.

587
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:26,165
Come on, come on, come on.

588
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:00,408
Open up, 407!

589
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,884
Open up, 222!

590
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,240
Open up, 217!

591
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:32,765
This is it, man. The bigs.

592
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:34,929
Major league.

593
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:37,369
Nice, huh?

594
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,524
Fuck up again,

595
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,688
this is where you're gonna end up.

596
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,481
Like I said, life's a choice, right?

597
01:15:48,321 --> 01:15:49,804
It's up to you.

598
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,281
Open up, 344!

599
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:11,409
Under ordinary circumstances, O'Brien,
I'd add six months to your time.

600
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,764
But just this once,

601
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:18,925
I'm gonna give you another chance.

602
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,485
Consider yourself lucky. Frank!

603
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,484
Just remember, you're supposed to be
some kind of an example here.

604
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,401
Don't make a fool out of me, O'Brien.

605
01:16:58,401 --> 01:16:59,568
You look terrible.

606
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,081
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

607
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,084
Did you see J.C.?

608
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,167
Yeah.

609
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:17,681
John, take this. Get that.

610
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,807
Yo, O'Brien!

611
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,001
I gotta talk to you.

612
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,120
Okay, here it comes.

613
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,408
Paco Moreno is here.

614
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,681
He's being processed right now
and he'll be coming into C-block.

615
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,245
I don't have to tell you,
we're not exactly thrilled about this,

616
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,929
but we had a logjam in admissions,
and that's the way it is.

617
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,565
Now, I suggest you stay cool.

618
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:21,808
Because if you fuck up,
the only person you'll be fucking up is you.

619
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,121
You've got six months to go before review.

620
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,520
Do your time clean and you walk.

621
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,685
Any trouble,
and you could grow old in here, Jack.

622
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:36,681
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

623
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,527
I can't hear you.

624
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,201
Yes, Sir.

625
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,401
Your bad!

626
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:45,328
This facility runs on a point system.

627
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,168
Points are time.

628
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,328
You get points for doing good
and points for screwing up.

629
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,725
Doing good is no trouble.

630
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,607
Coping a positive attitude.

631
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:00,481
While screwing up is fighting,
running for the fence,

632
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,205
and coping a shit attitude,

633
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,168
just like you're doing right now,
for instance.

634
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:16,129
Moreno, we know all about you and O'Brien.

635
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,527
Really?

636
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,525
And I just don't want any shit from you.

637
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,925
I want that dorm to stay nice and quiet.

638
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,920
What makes you think
I'm gonna give you any trouble?

639
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,641
Hey, man, the only reason you're here

640
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,444
is because there's no room for you
any place else.

641
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,044
Well, then why don't you get me a room
at the Holiday Inn?

642
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,120
Why don't you wise up?

643
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,328
Do you know what goes on inside here?

644
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,364
Time stands still.

645
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,888
Outside, everybody else goes on
with their lives.

646
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,205
Working, making money, getting laid,
all that good shit.

647
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,968
But in here, time just stops dead.

648
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,168
Look at your bad self, man.

649
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,529
I was into that gang shit for half my life.

650
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,444
It's dumb-fucking-nowhere shit!

651
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,521
Hey, in here, everybody's the same.

652
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,927
And I mean everybody.

653
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:27,001
So, until we get you transferred,
I expect you to make good time.

654
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,884
That's right, that's right.

655
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,001
We gonna have your ass shipped down state

656
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,089
as soon as there's an opening
in another facility.

657
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,000
That could take a week, or a month,

658
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,927
or maybe even a year.

659
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,480
But until you go,

660
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:45,888
you're gonna be real cool.

661
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,201
You got it?

662
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:52,401
Well, well.

663
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,568
O'Brien,

664
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,520
how's it going?

665
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,805
I hear you're king shit in this place.

666
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,205
Congratulations. If there's anything
I can do to help,

667
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,844
please, let me know.

668
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,408
I'm sorry about your little brother,
Moreno. Okay?

669
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,400
You really break my heart. You know that?

670
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,609
I'm sorry about your old lady.

671
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,845
I'm sorry I didn't get to finish the job.

672
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,247
Stay off my ass, Moreno.

673
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,365
'Cause I got six months before my review,

674
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,805
and I wanna make good time. You got that?

675
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:38,248
Yeah, well, let me tell you something,
maricón. You're already dead.

676
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,804
Only you don't know it

677
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:43,088
because you're just as fucking stupid
as you ever was.

678
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,888
Yeah. I killed your little brother, Moreno.

679
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:50,324
But you just remember, he's dead
because you weren't looking out for him.

680
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,441
All you guys up there, pay attention!

681
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,169
Burns, Richards, Ocampo, K.P.!

682
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,044
Hey, we've got a theater, man!

683
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:17,569
Johnson, Roberts,
Perretti, Lee, Horowitz, agriculture!

684
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,647
All right, quiet down!

685
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,367
Moreno,

686
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,208
shithouse.

687
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,644
You like it, pretty?

688
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:48,129
Lassandro, Tolson,
Gonzalez, Jones, Lopez, commons.

689
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,164
Lopez, get a mop and start with this.

690
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,564
Man!

691
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,167
Thompson...

692
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,921
Hey! You gonna keep that all day?

693
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,688
- Who's it gonna be?
- The new guy.

694
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,761
Five bucks.

695
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,604
Make that

696
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,924
two times.

697
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,888
- He's gonna smash that white dude.
- Yeah.

698
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,921
I hear O'Brien messed up your face.

699
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,240
You know, it's too bad.

700
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:51,487
And he killed your brother.

701
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,960
Yeah, that's right.

702
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,120
But he didn't kill me.

703
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,524
He's not getting out of here alive.

704
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,848
You forget it, Moreno. He's mine.

705
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,920
Yeah?

706
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,048
Yeah.

707
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,727
This is nice. It's real nice.

708
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,961
But it looks like me and you got a problem.

709
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,448
You know,
they're betting on who's gonna kill who.

710
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,167
Moreno's the odds-on favorite.

711
01:25:40,799 --> 01:25:43,680
Perretti and the chink
are running the action.

712
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,924
Who you betting on?

713
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,684
You.

714
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,841
So, what are you gonna do about this cunt?

715
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,921
Nothing.

716
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,884
I wanna get the fuck out of this place.

717
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,443
Yeah, but he's gonna kill you.

718
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,164
That's what he says.

719
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,244
- Gentlemen.
- Yo!

720
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,040
You've all been graded
on those latest reports.

721
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,688
And I'm happy to tell you,
finally, you all passed.

722
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,560
I knew I was good.

723
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,080
And there's a real artist in this class.

724
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,843
Somebody with special talent.

725
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,801
I didn't even know about it myself
until this report.

726
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,808
But first, for the record, let me give you
my definition of what art is.

727
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,081
Now, art is the creation
of something beautiful from nothing.

728
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,203
- You know?
- That's me.

729
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:48,328
And Lofgren has added a very special page
to his footnote

730
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,207
to his report. Stand up, man.

731
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:51,804
I think this is beautiful.
I wanna share with the group.

732
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,360
- Faggot.
- Didn't know you had it in you.

733
01:27:01,599 --> 01:27:04,327
Cool it! Cool it, I said!

734
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,080
Hey, Horowitz, stand up, man.

735
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,964
You read this to the class.

736
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,004
"Youth killed in robbery attempt.

737
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,120
"A youth died Saturday
from gunshot wounds

738
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,448
"received in an attempted holdup
of a liquor store.

739
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:28,641
"Police said Warren Jerome of Chicago
was shot twice in the abdomen

740
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,764
"by the proprietor of the High Jay
liquor store on Kimball Avenue,

741
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,521
"after brandishing a pistol
and demanding money.

742
01:27:35,599 --> 01:27:39,800
"Jerome died undergoing surgery
at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Hospital."

743
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,368
So what?

744
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,404
So what? Who the fuck is Warren Jerome?

745
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,688
Who the fuck cares?

746
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,320
Really. Who the fuck cares?

747
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,564
Shut up!

748
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,645
Yeah, Viking, tell them
who Warren Jerome was.

749
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,248
That was Tweety, you assholes.

750
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,448
Hey, what are the odds on me now, Perretti?

751
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:17,081
Three-to-two, against you.

752
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,243
Nothing personal.

753
01:28:46,519 --> 01:28:49,967
Hey! Clean it up!

754
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,160
Fuck you, O'Brien.

755
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,968
Yeah, fuck you. You clean it up.

756
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,840
- Hey!
- No violence!

757
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:01,244
Hey! You wanna play? You wanna play?

758
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,360
Clean it up!

759
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:05,727
Give your partner a hand, man.

760
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,961
Horowitz started this shit.
Come on, who started this shit?

761
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:09,687
I got $5 on Moreno.

762
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:18,727
Horowitz, you forgot something, man.

763
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,681
Yeah, yeah, Lofgren,
you show us your weenie later.

764
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:30,840
- How's it going?
- It's going.

765
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,527
Any word yet on the Paco Moreno transfer?

766
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:36,640
I haven't heard yet.

767
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,960
NO, huh?

768
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:41,763
'Cause this thing's
ready to blow any minute.

769
01:29:43,159 --> 01:29:44,239
I can feel it.

770
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,840
I'll see what I can do.

771
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,561
In the meantime,
you just have to keep an eye on 'em.

772
01:29:57,279 --> 01:29:59,167
You know what I do to squealers?

773
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,200
I let them have it in the belly,

774
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,884
so they can roll around for a long time,
thinking it oven

775
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,568
- Tell Lipschitz.
- All right.

776
01:30:14,559 --> 01:30:15,803
Lipschitz.

777
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:20,960
Hey, Lipschitz.

778
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:28,244
Name's Horowitz, asshole.

779
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,728
Horowitz Asshole?

780
01:30:35,799 --> 01:30:37,643
I heard it was Lipschitz.

781
01:30:37,719 --> 01:30:40,447
Yeah. And if your lip shits,
what's your asshole gonna do?

782
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:48,521
That's really brilliant.
Just keep it up, assholes.

783
01:30:48,599 --> 01:30:51,568
Oh, yeah? And what are
you gonna do about it, huh?

784
01:30:52,959 --> 01:30:55,043
- Hey, that's enough, Moreno.
- Oh, yeah, is it?

785
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,167
Yeah, it is.

786
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:57,767
Yeah. Well, eat shit and die, O'Brien!

787
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,768
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey.

788
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,280
Let's get a smoke.

789
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,128
You better smoke, you little...
It's bad for your health.

790
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,600
Hey, don't fall!

791
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:40,764
It's time you put that piece of garbage away.

792
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:45,079
He's gonna do it to you.

793
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:50,039
You can't do it, can you?

794
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,201
Then I'm gonna get those fuckers.

795
01:31:57,839 --> 01:31:59,967
Five minutes, lights out!

796
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,328
Yeah.

797
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,120
Lights out!

798
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,559
Here comes the rain, man.

799
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:45,366
Listen.

800
01:32:46,959 --> 01:32:49,404
After you do O'Brien,
what do you say, 50-50 split

801
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:52,280
and two cartons a week, huh?

802
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,400
I'll think about it.

803
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,487
Hold this.

804
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:29,920
Okay, now don't move.

805
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:37,086
All right, let go.

806
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,328
Shit. Man, I almost had it.

807
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:53,967
What are you doing?

808
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:57,004
What the fuck's eating you?

809
01:34:28,599 --> 01:34:29,843
Hey, what's up?

810
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,561
Yeah, we gotta shake 'em down.
Take Moreno, I'll take O'Brien.

811
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,768
O'Brien, looks like your time.

812
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:46,479
It's a bust.

813
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:04,843
Hurry up, Horowitz.

814
01:35:16,959 --> 01:35:18,006
Here he comes.

815
01:35:18,599 --> 01:35:22,560
O'Brien, Horowitz, let's go now!
Out, out, out, out!

816
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,003
Legs, spread them.

817
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,928
Spread them.

818
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:47,487
Stay over there.

819
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:51,287
Tell them you know your rights.

820
01:36:15,959 --> 01:36:17,039
Boys?

821
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:36,327
I'm going to get you, Horowitz.

822
01:36:37,519 --> 01:36:39,528
I'm not happy about this, Lofgren.

823
01:36:39,599 --> 01:36:40,767
Yes, Sir.

824
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:44,446
In fact, I'm very pissed off.

825
01:36:45,559 --> 01:36:47,326
I'm very pissed off!

826
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,928
This is an extremely serious offense,
and we are going to take disciplinary action.

827
01:36:53,999 --> 01:36:57,764
The only thing in your favor
is you admitted possession of this weapon.

828
01:36:58,759 --> 01:37:02,360
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Four weeks in solitary confinement

829
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:06,279
or four months added to your time.

830
01:37:10,839 --> 01:37:13,447
I'll take... I'll take the four months, sir.

831
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,087
Hey, hey. Flush the toilet.

832
01:37:56,799 --> 01:37:58,043
Not bad.

833
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,164
It's even better than the knife.

834
01:38:02,879 --> 01:38:05,563
Really? Forget it.

835
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:08,683
I told you, that cocksucker's mine.
I'm gonna take him out.

836
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,687
Now, wait a minute.

837
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:13,440
I lost my brother.

838
01:38:15,639 --> 01:38:17,647
All you lost was some skin.

839
01:38:59,079 --> 01:39:00,520
Hey, Robert.

840
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:05,119
You guys know where this came from?

841
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:07,360
- No.
- Sure?

842
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,959
Yes.

843
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:10,847
Very nice radio.

844
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,887
Yeah, it's mine now.

845
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:05,403
Somebody get somebody.

846
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:08,680
Somebody get somebody, man.

847
01:40:08,759 --> 01:40:10,320
Please, please. Come on, guys.

848
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:14,444
We identified the material
you used to make that charge.

849
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:18,683
Nitrogen from fertilizer. Very clever.

850
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,319
You're lucky Lofgren didn't die.

851
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:26,680
One question, Barry.
Did O'Brien know anything about this?

852
01:40:27,159 --> 01:40:30,159
No. I did it all myself.

853
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:32,479
All right.

854
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:35,363
You'll serve the remainder of
your time in this program

855
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:37,247
in solitary confinement, starting now.

856
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:38,527
Hey, no way, man.

857
01:40:38,519 --> 01:40:40,124
- I'm not going to solitary.
- Barry.

858
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:42,359
- Fuck you! I'm not going.
- Watch your mouth.

859
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:44,523
- Fuck you, man!
- Put it down, Barry.

860
01:40:45,959 --> 01:40:47,683
Churchill! Churchill!

861
01:40:47,799 --> 01:40:50,319
Get in here. Barry, stop it!

862
01:40:50,559 --> 01:40:52,283
- Come on, man!
- Barry, give up.

863
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:54,883
Fuck you! Kill me first, you understand?

864
01:40:54,879 --> 01:40:56,003
Barry, for God's sake, use your head.

865
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:58,600
- Get him!
- You'll have to kill me first!

866
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:01,919
- Come on! Come on!
- Get him! Get him!

867
01:41:01,999 --> 01:41:03,166
- Come on, fuckers!
- Barry...

868
01:41:04,919 --> 01:41:06,523
- Get him down.
- Fuck you...

869
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:09,083
Get him up! Barry!

870
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:11,327
Barry, you're just adding to your time.

871
01:41:11,319 --> 01:41:12,966
Fuck all you cunts!

872
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:50,283
Oh, Ray, I was just looking for you.

873
01:41:50,678 --> 01:41:53,079
The Moreno transfer just came through.

874
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:54,999
We're sending him off to Winfield tomorrow.

875
01:41:55,959 --> 01:41:57,759
- Thank God.
- Amen.

876
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:00,566
Perretti.

877
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:06,527
Moreno.

878
01:42:07,799 --> 01:42:10,244
Your transfer just got here.

879
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:13,163
You're going to Winfield tomorrow.

880
01:42:31,799 --> 01:42:33,087
How're you doing?

881
01:42:35,759 --> 01:42:36,960
Hey, O'Brien.

882
01:42:38,599 --> 01:42:41,119
I just heard your buddy Paco is leaving.

883
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:42,607
How about that?

884
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:43,803
What are you talking about?

885
01:42:43,879 --> 01:42:47,524
Moreno's being transferred
first thing tomorrow morning.

886
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:50,607
You got lucky.

887
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,442
Five minutes, lights out!

888
01:42:56,359 --> 01:42:57,800
Let's go!

889
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:05,643
- Hey, Briggs.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

890
01:43:06,518 --> 01:43:09,039
Put out that cigarette
and get your ass in bed.

891
01:43:09,479 --> 01:43:10,646
Yeah, yeah.

892
01:43:13,798 --> 01:43:17,367
Gentlemen, here comes the night.

893
01:45:11,559 --> 01:45:14,560
I think my appendix broke. Help me.

894
01:45:16,558 --> 01:45:18,283
- What happened?
- My...

895
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,043
- Your what?
- My appendix.

896
01:45:20,118 --> 01:45:21,406
Let me. ..

897
01:47:16,999 --> 01:47:19,366
Hey. Hey!

898
01:47:21,399 --> 01:47:23,199
Hold it, you guys.

899
01:47:24,638 --> 01:47:26,679
- What's happening, man?
- What's going on?

900
01:47:26,678 --> 01:47:27,845
Hey!

901
01:47:27,839 --> 01:47:29,563
Hey, it's going down, man. It's going down.

902
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:30,726
Hey, you guys!

903
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,119
- Hold it!
- Moreno!

904
01:47:34,678 --> 01:47:36,598
Come on, you fucking guys.

905
01:47:36,759 --> 01:47:37,883
Hold on!

906
01:47:38,478 --> 01:47:41,206
- Paco!
- Don't be crazy. Come on, man!

907
01:47:42,679 --> 01:47:45,406
Moreno! O'Brien! No!

908
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:03,719
Come on, man!

909
01:48:06,918 --> 01:48:08,523
Come on, man, you can take him.

910
01:48:41,799 --> 01:48:43,479
Come on!

911
01:48:51,959 --> 01:48:53,367
Get him, get him!

912
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:29,399
Let's go.

913
01:49:57,118 --> 01:49:58,362
Come on, O'Brien!

914
01:50:02,839 --> 01:50:04,202
Yeah, that's it!

915
01:50:07,998 --> 01:50:09,362
Come on!

916
01:50:54,518 --> 01:51:00,607
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

917
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:06,364
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

918
01:54:15,678 --> 01:54:18,799
In the rooms. Let's go. In the rooms.

919
01:54:23,278 --> 01:54:24,599
Lights off!

920
01:54:37,159 --> 01:54:38,119
Lights off!

921
01:54:42,478 --> 01:54:43,886
Hey, close that door.

922
01:54:45,038 --> 01:54:46,282
Let's close up there.
