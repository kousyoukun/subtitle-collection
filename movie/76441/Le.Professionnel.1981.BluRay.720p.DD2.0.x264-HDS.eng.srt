1
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,250
... it therefore appears
to be evident that,

2
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,333
when the defendant,
Josselin Beaumont,

3
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,417
arrived in Malagasy
on the 14th of May,

4
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:59,917
he had the full intention
to make an attempt on the life

5
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:05,375
of Colonel Njala, President
of the Republic of Malagasy.

6
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:11,208
It is hard to believe
that the defendant claims

7
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:17,083
to be acting in his own
initiative, Mr. President.

8
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,500
You admit to coming
to Malagasy

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,000
for the sole purpose
of killing President Njala?

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,417
Yes, Mr. President.

11
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:32,750
Are you aware of how
deplorable such crime is?

12
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, Mr. President.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,750
And you were not subject
to any political manipulation?

14
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,583
Are you aware,
Josselin Beaumont,

15
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:53,708
that I'll have to set an example
with your punishment?

16
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:00,375
Defendant, answer the
Attorney General's question!

17
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,792
The defendant
will rise!

18
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,917
The defendant needs to be
excused because of the heat.

19
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:27,542
The session is suspended
until further notice.

20
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,500
No, no, no, no!

21
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,125
No more of that!

22
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,125
You're driving me crazy
with that stuff!

23
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,333
Hey, what's
wrong with you?

24
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,083
Come on.

25
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,250
Don't be difficult now,
come on.

26
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,417
I don't want
anymore of that!

27
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,292
See?

28
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,375
Be reasonable,
come here.

29
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,750
Very well,

30
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
put his clothes
back on.

31
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,833
Let go of him, now.

32
00:05:56,542 --> 00:06:00,042
Well, Mr. Beaumont...

33
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:10,750
Perfect, excellent.

34
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,458
Let's continue where
we got interrupted.

35
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:24,167
I'll have to set an example
with your punishment.

36
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,917
Yes, Mr. President.

37
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,708
There we go, good!

38
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:36,833
Do you think you deserve
an exemplary punishment?

39
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,042
Yes, Mr. President.

40
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,625
Make three copies for me,
one for the President's staff,

41
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,500
one for Matignon
and one for Colonel Martin,

42
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,292
so all our friends can read it
every once in a while.

43
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, Mr. President.

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We are reporting live
from the courthouse,

45
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,542
where Josselin Beaumont's trial
is presently under way.

46
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,917
It seems that only
the President's grace

47
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,542
can save the terrorist
from capital punishment.

48
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,208
Everything depends on
the infinite compassion

49
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,458
of your Excellency.

50
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,625
If we want to gain
the sympathy of the French,

51
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,500
Beaumont must be
a very sick man,

52
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,625
so we'll have to
teach him a thing or two.

53
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,333
Up, get up, pig!

54
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,833
Get up!

55
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,125
You bastard!

56
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:36,542
Hurry up, get out of here,
they're coming!

57
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,583
The soldiers are
getting closer!

58
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,500
Get out, get out!

59
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,083
Don't stay here!

60
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,542
Hurry,
they're coming.

61
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,083
Ready?

62
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,500
Almost.

63
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,292
They're
coming closer.

64
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,750
Don't shoot!

65
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,167
We'll sneak out
through the back.

66
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,500
Okay.

67
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,958
No!

68
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,750
Am I going to die?

69
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,500
Yes...
are you afraid?

70
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,625
No, why?

71
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:06,375
Because I would be.

72
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,875
That's because
you'd go to hell.

73
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:37,292
What does
"Ludo Koda" mean?

74
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,750
That's the signature.

75
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,708
Oh, okay.

76
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,750
Captain Valera.

77
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,250
We got this strange telegram,
could you come up for a second?

78
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,042
I don't understand
any of it.

79
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,375
It doesn't seem like
any of the codes we're using.

80
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,917
Where was it sent from?

81
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,417
From around the corner.

82
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:09,333
It looks like the code
we used in Africa.

83
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,958
That's really weird,

84
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,083
you know how long it's been
since we used those codes?

85
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,292
More than two years,
Captain!

86
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:24,375
Who would use a code
that's two years old?

87
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,458
Someone who disappeared
for two years.

88
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,583
Well, we'll know more when
we put it into the decoder.

89
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,875
Hello?

90
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,167
Hello, Alice?

91
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,708
Edouard.

92
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,583
Am I bothering you,
were you in the bathtub?

93
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,500
No, I just got here.

94
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,667
Excellent, then you can just get
into a taxi and come over here.

95
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,250
Alice,
did you hear me?

96
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,875
Yes, Edouard.

97
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,458
And hurry!

98
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,750
Why?
What's going on?

99
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,000
Nothing good,
hurry up.

100
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,542
Yes.

101
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,458
Joss Beaumont
to Colonel Martin.

102
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,792
Go call the colonel!

103
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,750
- Call him, where?
- Anywhere, and do it now!

104
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,625
This is not funny!

105
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,708
Joss Beaumont is back!
Bravo, he's very strong!

106
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,708
So what does it say
in this telegram?

107
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,167
One second.

108
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,708
It says that the contract
will be fulfilled

109
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,917
between the 12th
and the 15th.

110
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:16,417
The contract between
the 12th...

111
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,875
The 12th...
starts in an hour!

112
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,042
And let me remind you that
President Njala

113
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,500
will be in France from
the 12th until the 15th.

114
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,792
That's why we didn't hear from
Beaumont after he escaped.

115
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,542
I'll be right with you.

116
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,708
Call Rosen, from our
special section immediately.

117
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:38,083
And tell Alice Ancelin to stay,
she might be useful.

118
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,458
And call the guy from
the shooting school there,

119
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,500
he could
help find Beaumont,

120
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
What's the name of
that brute again?

121
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,917
The instructor, Picard.

122
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,708
That's it, Picard.

123
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:54,167
And above all, find the Minister
for me, will you?

124
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,958
I want to be covered!

125
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,708
Understood, Colonel.

126
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,333
- Captain Valera!
- Yes?

127
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:03,000
Put Joss Beaumont's wife under
surveillance immediately.

128
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,667
Isn't it a crazy idea
to go there?

129
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,125
And the telegram, that's even
crazier, don't you think?

130
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,042
Sure, Colonel.

131
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,583
Maybe we should
let his wife know.

132
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,458
What do you think
I'm doing?

133
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,750
Somebody's on the line
with her right now.

134
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,625
Hello,
surveillance service--

135
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,000
Can't you give them
a few minutes?

136
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,917
Jeanne, darling, you'll be
under surveillance very soon,

137
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:49,083
so we won't
be able to talk.

138
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,708
No, Joss,
don't hang up!

139
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,333
Please, Joss,
come here!

140
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,250
They'll probably come
to your place.

141
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,625
As soon as they're gone,

142
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,042
you close the shades
in the living room,

143
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,500
and I'll come see you
during the night.

144
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,458
What, what is it?

145
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,750
I'm clean, I took
a shower last month!

146
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,042
All right, yes,
where's the truck?

147
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:51,458
Oh, you're not
the police?

148
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,625
What time is it?

149
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,750
What do you want
in exchange?

150
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,292
- An associate.
- What?

151
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:01,542
An associate to
do some business for me.

152
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,333
Are you aware,
Josselin Beaumont,

153
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:11,792
that I'll have to set an example
with your punishment?

154
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:15,042
You are a monster,
Josselin Beaumont.

155
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,292
Obviously!

156
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,042
And you were not subject to
any political manipulation?

157
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,042
Yes,
Mr. President.

158
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,042
Josselin Beaumont,

159
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:36,292
are you aware of the
recklessness of your plan?

160
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,542
Gentlemen.

161
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,125
Good morning, Martin.

162
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,083
Thank you for coming, sir.

163
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:50,500
I have to rest a little bit, I...

164
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,292
Do you have coffee?

165
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,458
Of course.

166
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,625
Alice.

167
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,167
Yes, sir,
I'll bring some.

168
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,000
I hoped for
a good night's sleep,

169
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,917
I've been sleeping
terribly lately.

170
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:12,250
I took a sleeping pill.

171
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,167
Did I ask
for some coffee?

172
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,458
Here it is, sir.

173
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,750
Thank you.

174
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,917
So, I'm all ears,
Colonel Martin.

175
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:28,042
Josselin Beaumont
is in Paris.

176
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:31,083
Who's that?

177
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,417
Commander
Josselin Beaumont,

178
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:36,375
an agent of
the Special Action Service,

179
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:40,083
He came back after
two years of captivity.

180
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,750
His return is causing us
major problems.

181
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,458
Why is that?

182
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:51,000
He wants to kill
President Njala.

183
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,292
Njala?

184
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:55,917
Kill Njala, but why?

185
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:06,917
It's not easy
to explain...

186
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:13,125
Well, we...
how should I put it?

187
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,542
Because we gave him the order
to do it, two years ago.

188
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,667
Who's "we"?

189
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,792
Your predecessor, sir.

190
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,250
Marchadeau?

191
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,625
Yes.

192
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,083
Philippe Marchadeau?

193
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,500
Yes, sir.

194
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,750
I can explain
his political motives--

195
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,958
That's not necessary.
What happened exactly?

196
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:50,167
Well, we sent
Commander Beaumont to Africa.

197
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,208
You've already
told me that.

198
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:56,833
Miss, would you give me a little
bit of coffee, please?

199
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,708
I'm listening.

200
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,667
When he arrived
in Malagasy,

201
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,542
the political situation
had completely changed,

202
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:09,375
there was no more need
to kill President Njala.

203
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,625
Of course not!

204
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,250
So, did you
call Beaumont back?

205
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,208
No, sir.

206
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:22,208
Why?

207
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,583
Would you like some cognac
in your coffee, sir?

208
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:29,125
I'm asking you,
why you didn't call him back?

209
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,625
Well, because we considered
it appropriate

210
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:41,208
to inform President Njala
of Beaumont's presence.

211
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:44,083
You sold him!

212
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:51,958
No, sir, not sold,
we gave him for free...

213
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,875
for governmental reasons,
usually that means for free.

214
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,958
Let me introduce you
to my associate.

215
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:04,000
He'll explain everything
about our business to you.

216
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,625
We'll walk around together
and I'll tell you what to do.

217
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,083
What do we get
out of this?

218
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,958
Yeah, what?

219
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,625
Ask my associate.

220
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,042
Don't worry,
you won't regret it.

221
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,167
He's an honest guy.

222
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,583
Can we go?

223
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,375
Okay, yeah.

224
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,208
Let's go.

225
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,208
Hey, slow down,
we're not athletes!

226
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,750
I'd really like to know
why he sent this message.

227
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,958
Why?

228
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:08,000
Look at us, sir, this is only
our first sleepless night.

229
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,375
There'll be many more.

230
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,208
What are you
planning to do?

231
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,292
Whatever it takes.

232
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:20,000
Ha! It's not gonna be
a piece of cake.

233
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,708
Instructor Picard, he's the one
who trained Beaumont.

234
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,958
That's the worst
part of it, sir,

235
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,208
Beaumont knows
all the tricks.

236
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,750
And why?

237
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,458
Because we taught him
every single move,

238
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,583
every clever turn.

239
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,250
He was my favorite
student, sir.

240
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,667
If I had a son, I'd want
him to be like Beaumont.

241
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,875
That's very touching,

242
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,042
but it won't help us
solve our problems.

243
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:51,792
If he's that good, it'll be
very difficult to stop him.

244
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:57,500
Still he'll have to move around,
contact some people.

245
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,250
Unfortunately not,

246
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,500
I taught him how to be
completely self-sufficient,

247
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,167
to operate in
enemy territory.

248
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,458
Whatever the circumstance,
he's got the "white ones".

249
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,542
Huh?

250
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,417
It's a term used in chess.

251
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,375
The white ones have the benefit
of the offensive.

252
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,500
He'll always be
one step ahead.

253
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,375
He'll pull some
amazing tricks on us!

254
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,042
He'll improvise everything.

255
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,458
He'll know where we are,
he'll drive us crazy!

256
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,167
Beaumont won't come here.

257
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,167
The whole night we'll
sit around for nothing.

258
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,250
If you were free tonight,
would you go see your wife?

259
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,125
No, I'd go see yours.

260
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,708
Very funny.

261
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,333
Go ahead!

262
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,917
You dirty bastard!

263
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,083
- What's this?
- It's a bunch of bums.

264
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,292
They seem
completely drunk.

265
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,208
Go, for God's sake!

266
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,792
They stole my cognac!

267
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,583
My cognac!

268
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,750
Follow me!

269
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,292
Get lost,
you stinkin' drunks!

270
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,583
Get out of here!

271
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,042
Help me, you idiot!

272
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,833
I can't, I'm stuck!

273
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,625
Go, out of the way
get lost!

274
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,167
What's this?

275
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,292
It's my alarm clock, for when
I take my little nap.

276
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,333
Go, get lost already!

277
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:36,792
on a little boat...

278
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:40,667
Hey, my alarm clock,
my alarm clock!

279
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,083
Maybe now is a good time to have
a little coffee, isn't it?

280
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,417
Yes, you're right.

281
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,250
What is it with
this shitty neighborhood?

282
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,625
It's a shitty neighborhood,
all neighborhoods are shitty,

283
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,958
and it's not
gonna change because

284
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,042
they put a little bit
of green in it!

285
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,792
It stinks like
the gutter here.

286
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:13,292
Gentlemen, I find you
to be very pessimistic.

287
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:16,583
Remember, Beaumont had to first
go through brainwashing,

288
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,583
then two years
of brutal treatment in Malagasy,

289
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:22,125
and finally the difficulties
of his extravagant escape.

290
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,750
He's probably weak and tired.

291
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,000
Weak and tired?

292
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,250
On the contrary,

293
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,792
the Biribian regime had to
invigorate Beaumont.

294
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:32,125
He'll be at his best!

295
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,625
Let me tell you
one thing, sir.

296
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,292
There's a lot on the line.

297
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:40,208
I mean, if the politicians don't
kick him out soon enough,

298
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,500
then, boom!
No more blacks!

299
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,375
Enough!
Thank you, Picard!

300
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,333
Wait, I'm not finished.

301
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,250
Thank you, Picard!

302
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:59,167
Gentlemen, after that brilliant
thesis, let me tell you this:

303
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,417
if there's no more blacks,
there's no more service,

304
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,500
and no more Minister.

305
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,708
Boom!
The whole world would blow.

306
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,125
No, we'll get him!

307
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,542
We'll stop him.

308
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,083
Stop him?

309
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:14,667
Who will stop him?

310
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:17,333
I will.

311
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:21,333
Inspector Rosen from
the Intervention Bureau.

312
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,750
Joss...
Is that you, Joss?

313
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,042
Two years!

314
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,375
I almost went out of my mind
waiting for you.

315
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,333
Jeanne, I've hurt you
so much already.

316
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,208
I don't want to give you
fleas on top of it.

317
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:04,583
The guy who gave me this coat
hasn't seen soap in years.

318
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:12,208
One minute of tenderness,
hours of itching.

319
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,750
Did you tell Alice Ancelin
that you're back?

320
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,083
Forget Alice Ancelin,
it's been two years...

321
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,000
with expiration today.

322
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,958
I haven't forgotten.

323
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:44,542
And I'm sure
she hasn't either.

324
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:48,125
Now I'm here with you,
aren't I?

325
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,542
The service called me just
two minutes after you did.

326
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,667
Valera.

327
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:02,375
He told me
about the telegram.

328
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,292
Why didn't you come here
before you sent it?

329
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,917
It was the telegram that
triggered the surveillance,

330
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,583
the searching the apartment,
the roadblocks downstairs.

331
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:14,167
Why did you
do that, Joss?

332
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:18,542
Did you come here to see me,
or to play with them?

333
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:25,167
Your return, is it for love
or provocation?

334
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:33,833
Valera told me you want to kill
Njala, that you went crazy!

335
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,458
I couldn't stand
losing you once again, Joss!

336
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:39,708
I love you.

337
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,792
I don't like them,
Jeanne.

338
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,500
They've killed a soldier
named Josselin Beaumont,

339
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,083
he was killed in ambush,
years ago...

340
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,125
You can imagine, it took
a lot of explaining

341
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,500
before they sent
me down there,

342
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,917
before I would slide
their guns into my suitcase.

343
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,833
They told me that
Njala was a monster,

344
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:08,625
that he had to be killed,
that it'd be an honor to do it.

345
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:14,375
I had foolish conceptions about
honor and pride back then.

346
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,375
I was so wide-eyed
and eager.

347
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:23,333
I hate them, Jeanne, and I want
them to pay for what they did.

348
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,958
In the beginning,
Valera came every Sunday,

349
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:30,917
then every other Sunday,
then every three weeks.

350
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,042
Then one night,
he came and said to me,

351
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,167
"I'll resign."

352
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,625
The papers had just announced

353
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,375
your trial and your
condemnation.

354
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:43,000
His resignation was refused,
but he handed it in.

355
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,125
Yes, he did.

356
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,625
At what time does the concierge
throw out the garbage?

357
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:51,458
Around seven,
seven thirty.

358
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,875
Put the bum's clothes
and the alarm clock

359
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,708
on top of the garbage,
so that it is clearly visible.

360
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,917
Why, what are
you gonna do?

361
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,625
I'm leaving.

362
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,958
They'll certainly
pay you a visit.

363
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:07,958
Hopefully it'll be Martin,
in the worst case, Rosen.

364
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:10,417
He's a bastard,
but a great cop.

365
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,875
He'll definitely
come to bother you.

366
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,708
And then?

367
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,250
Then he'll leave.

368
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,500
No, I'm talking about
the two of us.

369
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,542
Listen, Jeanne,

370
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:25,708
right now, there is
Njala, Rosen, Martin,

371
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:32,250
the four of us, the six of us
the twelve of us.

372
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,833
As long as all these people
are involved,

373
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:37,417
there'll be no such thing
as the two of us.

374
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:03,583
Hello.

375
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,833
Edouard?

376
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,083
Joss.

377
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:09,042
I'm at Jeanne's,
but I won't be for much longer,

378
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:11,375
'cause I can smell
Rosen's arrival.

379
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,000
Why Rosen?

380
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,458
As if you didn't know.
It would be better if you came.

381
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,333
Why are you calling?

382
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,167
You know
we're being tapped.

383
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,417
It's illegal to tap people's
lines, isn't it?

384
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:27,167
The noise you just heard was
birds sitting on the cable.

385
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,542
Be a good boy,
come here.

386
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:34,917
The concierge brought out
the garbage.

387
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:39,625
I put your stuff in
just in time... Joss?

388
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,083
Joss?

389
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,875
So, Mr. Inspector,
now you're a garbageman?

390
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,125
Tell Rosen
to come immediately.

391
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,500
Beaumont was here.

392
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,208
Tell the others, too, ask them
if they noticed anything.

393
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,208
How did he do it?

394
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,708
The bum!

395
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,708
Where is he?

396
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,583
Where is he? I not gonna
ask you fifty times!

397
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,000
He's gone.

398
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,375
I'm warning you,
you better not mess with us!

399
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,667
So, I just found the clothes in
the trash, and the alarm clock.

400
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:30,792
I recognize it,
I know it was him.

401
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,750
So, for the last time,
where did he go?

402
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,292
You're making a big mistake
by not telling me anything.

403
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:41,833
Rosen's methods are a lot
less pleasant, believe me!

404
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,458
You won't get him,
anyway!

405
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,708
Bitch!

406
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,458
Farges, Rosen is coming,
I'll get him.

407
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,208
It's on the sixth floor.

408
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,458
Good morning,
Inspector.

409
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:11,625
Morning, Inspector Farges
is waiting for you upstairs.

410
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:25,042
Bravo,
my compliments, Farges.

411
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:28,333
He came and left again and all
that right in front of you!

412
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:35,750
Then again,
I understand you well.

413
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,750
You were waiting for
a nervous officer by himself,

414
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,792
instead you see a group of bums
drinking and singing.

415
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:45,417
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

416
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:49,042
You're certainly right,
Inspector Farges...

417
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:51,375
<i>Assistant
Inspector Farges.</i>

418
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,625
So, get lost now
and lift all the roadblocks.

419
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,542
He won't come back.

420
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:14,958
Very funny, the alarm clock
in the garbage.

421
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,958
Are you gonna tell me
when he left now, or what?

422
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:20,583
Who?

423
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:26,000
Miss Beaumont, please,
when did he leave?

424
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,958
I don't know.

425
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:32,000
Where is he now?

426
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,042
I don't know.

427
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,792
Where are you going
to see him again?

428
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:42,375
I don't know.

429
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,292
I think I'm
losing my patience.

430
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:47,083
Don't get carried away,
Inspector, there's no point.

431
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,750
She's protecting him,
she can't help it.

432
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,250
It's love, passion!

433
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,792
It's nobody's fault,
really.

434
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:58,292
You're certainly right,
sergeant,

435
00:45:58,292 --> 00:46:00,542
I shouldn't
get carried away.

436
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:02,792
I beg your forgiveness,
Madame.

437
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:11,333
See, he apologizes,
that's how he is.

438
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:16,542
You might become good friends
if you tell him the truth.

439
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:20,833
I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

440
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:23,500
When are you going to see
Beaumont again?

441
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,375
I'm not sure that your
friendliness is very effective.

442
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:32,667
Sure, we're getting
along just fine.

443
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,667
You'll tell me,
won't you?

444
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:37,250
The whole truth.

445
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,625
You'll tell me the whole truth,
l know you will.

446
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:44,625
You're looking
pretty good, girl.

447
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,167
Beaumont must have been more
than happy to see you again,

448
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:50,042
after two long years!

449
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:55,292
Your eyes look like you didn't
get too much sleep tonight.

450
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,125
I'm sure you two
were having fun last night,

451
00:46:57,125 --> 00:47:00,667
a lot of fun...

452
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:04,167
fun... fun!

453
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,417
After a night like that,
you must want to take a shower,

454
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:08,958
a nice warm shower?

455
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,417
No.

456
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:15,375
A warm shower, and then a cold
one and then a hot one.

457
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,000
No!

458
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,417
I'll soap you
from head to toe.

459
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:21,125
You'd be surprised by what
I can do with a bar of soap.

460
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:29,250
I'm begging you,
stop playing these games.

461
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:35,000
Miss Beaumont, I cannot remain
in the room with a naked lady.

462
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,583
That would be against
the regulations, wouldn't it?

463
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,917
Sergeant, you take
care of Miss Beaumont.

464
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:45,208
If that's an order,
Inspector.

465
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,000
No use in screaming.

466
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,375
Rosen couldn't care less about
what I'm going to do with you,

467
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,000
as long as
I make you talk.

468
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,667
And if it helps to find
this son of a gun, Beaumont,

469
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,667
He won't even care if
I rape you.

470
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,625
You'll see,
it's very healthy!

471
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:02,875
And good for
the blood circulation.

472
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:04,833
That's what they do
in Sweden.

473
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,583
Afterward,
they spank each other...

474
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,917
Do you want me
to spank you?

475
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:09,750
Oh, you're so cute.

476
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,875
All right.

477
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,500
Oh, she's soaking.

478
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:29,375
Rosen, I'm always
right behind you.

479
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:35,958
You knew he was there,
didn't you?

480
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,125
I'll get him yet,
I'll get him!

481
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:57,375
Oh, Edouard!

482
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:16,417
You know, Rosen, now I know how
we can find Joss Beaumont.

483
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:19,292
We'll follow you everywhere,
my friend!

484
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:22,208
Because the day someone puts
a bullet through your head,

485
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:25,583
Joss won't be far!

486
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:42,458
That was smart,
now you have no more coffee.

487
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,083
Leave it.

488
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,417
That's for me.

489
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:49,375
I didn't want to hit her,
I swear.

490
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:50,708
Rosen had me do it.

491
00:50:55,875 --> 00:51:01,542
l didn't want to hit you either,
but my wife asked me to.

492
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:07,250
Come on, commander, it's my job,
I hate to slap people.

493
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,917
You're right,
that's your job.

494
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,250
It's your job.

495
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,583
The croissant
is on my friend there.

496
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:09,542
And he'll stay
for three days.

497
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:12,750
That's a long time,
a very long time.

498
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:18,083
Not for us, we're hoping to
trade a part of his reserves

499
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:21,417
for a nuclear plant
with immediate access.

500
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:25,292
Three days is no time at all
to be able to convince him.

501
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:31,875
Right, but it's more than
enough time to kill him.

502
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,125
Your Excellency, I'm sorry
to disturb you, but--

503
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,667
That's all right, Arthur.

504
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:42,667
The colonel of the security,
Martin, wants to see you.

505
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,833
I'll receive him
after dinner or tomorrow.

506
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,958
Your Excellence,
tomorrow you have a meeting

507
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:48,333
with the President
of the Council.

508
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,125
It'll be a busy day.

509
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,083
Well, in that case,
I won't see him at all.

510
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,042
It must be very urgent,
your Excellency,

511
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:55,625
he's waited for
more than an hour.

512
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:58,083
They let me
wait fifteen years, Arthur,

513
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,708
and for the most part,
in prison.

514
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:03,458
One little hour
certainly did him no harm.

515
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:10,625
Gentlemen, his Excellency
can see you now.

516
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,583
This way, please.

517
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,375
How are you planning to handle
my protection in this case?

518
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:23,625
We understand that this palace
can offer great comfort

519
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:26,875
and the neighborhood certainly
is a very pleasant one,

520
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:30,000
but right now, I'm afraid it is
not the safest place for you.

521
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,417
Too many come and go here,

522
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,917
and it is hard
to keep track of everyone.

523
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:37,000
As far as safety is concerned,
this is a disaster.

524
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Please, tell me
if I'm mistaken,

525
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,667
I hope you don't intend
to lock me in my embassy.

526
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,250
Of course not, Mr. President.

527
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,667
We would have never
even thought of such a thing.

528
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,417
Does your Excellence
need anything else?

529
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:49,792
No, thanks.

530
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,667
So where are you
planning to keep me?

531
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:54,583
Luckily, there's many castles
in our country.

532
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,208
Unless you're talking about

533
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:58,042
the Senate's Palace
in the Luxembourg gardens,

534
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,042
I am afraid you must
be referring to

535
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:02,208
one of your giant isolated
castles in the country,

536
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,417
where your kings
died of boredom.

537
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:08,333
Oh, I'm sorry!

538
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,583
I thought you
were alone.

539
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,750
Miss Frederiksen.

540
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,667
Hello, Miss.

541
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:21,542
Doris, my love,

542
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:23,833
what do you think of
the French countryside?

543
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,958
Yuk!

544
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:45,083
You heard it, reason dictates
what politeness forbids.

545
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,875
So long, gentlemen.

546
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,250
Good evening.

547
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,375
- To you, too.
- Thanks.

548
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Shit, another one.

549
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,542
So, what's
the first question?

550
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:31,125
Doris Frederiksen.

551
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:36,000
Having been faithful to
his Excellency for years now,

552
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,750
she recently began an affair,
very Italian and passionate.

553
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:45,917
You got it!

554
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,958
With whom?

555
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:52,042
Volfoni Salvatore that's
the ice cream and soda Volfoni.

556
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:53,833
Correct!

557
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,625
And where?

558
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,125
In the Hilton Hotel.

559
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,875
I can even tell you where to
reach Miss Doris Frederiksen.

560
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,500
Wrong!

561
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,083
2250563, under
the name of "Miss Claude".

562
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:08,625
One wrong answer
and you lose everything.

563
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:10,500
You're good,
though!

564
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:14,500
Please hold, I'll
put her on the phone.

565
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,042
It is Madame.

566
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:18,375
Madame who?

567
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,542
Madame.

568
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,708
Hello?

569
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,000
Hello, Doris?

570
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,542
Yes, is that you?

571
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:25,625
Is four to five
tomorrow good for you?

572
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:27,208
That depends
on who it is!

573
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,958
I have the black man
coming tomorrow at seven.

574
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:30,708
Salvatore Volfoni.

575
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:34,625
Ah, Salvatore, that's different,
at the Hilton?

576
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,125
Suite 1056.

577
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,583
Oh Claude,

578
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:42,083
send this to
Inspector Rosen.

579
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,125
Doris Frederiksen?

580
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,750
Yes.

581
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,375
Inspector Rosen,
from the savage squad.

582
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:58,000
Someone is planning
to kill President Njala.

583
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,833
I thought I'd warn you.

584
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,667
How does
that concern me?

585
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:04,292
Let's say you're
the president's weak spot.

586
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,875
The killer will try
to get to him through you.

587
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:09,458
In case he contacts you,
try to keep him there,

588
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,750
and call me immediately
at this number.

589
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:16,417
Two of my men will follow you
for a few days.

590
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:19,333
You're not even asking
for my consent?

591
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:22,250
Your consent?
I couldn't care less.

592
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,125
And what if I refuse?

593
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,292
If you refuse,
you'll have an accident,

594
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:29,042
for example,
in the elevator.

595
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,750
The cable will snap,

596
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,042
and they'll find you
six stories down

597
00:57:33,042 --> 00:57:35,333
with your stiletto heels
up your throat.

598
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,042
See you soon,
mademoiselle.

599
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,625
Yes.

600
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,875
Mr. Volfoni,
the ice-cream-and-soda man?

601
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,083
Yes.

602
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:55,042
Joss Beaumont,
espionage and ass-kicking!

603
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,250
Does it amuse you to follow me
around like this?

604
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,542
We're not doing this
for fun, we're working.

605
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:18,625
Where are you going?

606
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:21,083
To work.

607
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,208
From here on,
it's private!

608
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,292
- Who is it?
- Doris.

609
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,542
I'm coming.
Good boy, stay there.

610
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,333
Oh, I'm sorry,
this must be the wrong room.

611
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,750
Is this 1056?

612
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,292
It is.
I have to apologize.

613
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,042
I came with no notice,
impromptu,

614
00:58:58,042 --> 00:58:59,500
even a little shameless.

615
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,375
Salvatore didn't tell me
that we'd be three.

616
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,333
I don't have
a problem with it, but--

617
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,333
Three, Salvatore,
ah, good old Salvatore.

618
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,583
Where is my head?

619
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:11,750
Yes, he's in the closet,
next to the ties.

620
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,542
Which closet?

621
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:18,542
I should have specified,
this is a suite, after all.

622
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:20,417
I never lie.

623
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:21,667
I hope he won't
get too wrinkled.

624
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,417
I didn't have the time
to put him on a hanger.

625
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:26,583
What sort of behavior is this,
to lock people into closets?

626
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,875
I needed to see you
privately, alone.

627
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,875
I heard a lot about you.

628
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:34,542
From whom?

629
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:37,167
The black man.

630
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,792
Would you happen to be
the delinquent

631
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:42,333
that this furious cop
was talking to me about?

632
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,917
The furious guy,
did he give you his,

633
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:47,042
"Rosen, from the savage squad,
I'll make you eat your shoes"?

634
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:50,792
He didn't say my shoes,
he said my stilettos.

635
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:52,500
What does this brute
want from me?

636
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,333
Rosen?

637
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:56,458
He'd just love
to kill me.

638
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:59,417
But in order to do that,
he needs to catch me,

639
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:02,375
and in order to catch me,
he's counting on you.

640
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:09,542
And you, what do you
have in mind?

641
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:11,708
Do you really
want to kill Njala?

642
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,708
Would that cause you
a lot of pain?

643
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,708
Well, no,
that's not the point.

644
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:18,250
But if you put one half of my
sugar daddies in the closet,

645
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,667
and kill the other half,

646
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:22,667
I'll end up
with nothing to wear!

647
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:25,625
Well, that's just
an expression.

648
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,708
Listen,
let's make a deal.

649
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,167
You can keep Njala
for a little longer,

650
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,625
long enough to get a maximum
of money out of him,

651
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,083
and in exchange,
you'll do me a favor.

652
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,917
A favor?

653
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:38,333
Yup, you'll tell Rosen that
I asked you plenty of questions

654
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:42,542
about Njala's safety,
the number of body guards,

655
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:47,042
the placement of his bed,
his habits, that kind of thing.

656
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:50,875
How does that help you?

657
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:53,042
Rosen won't be able
to sleep at night.

658
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:56,500
And when you don't sleep,
your hands start trembling,

659
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,708
your head
becomes clouded,

660
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:03,292
let's say it could
be to my advantage.

661
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,875
He asked me to keep you here
and call him.

662
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,875
And you think
that's amusing?

663
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:13,458
No, I was just thinking that
I wouldn't be so against

664
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:17,042
the thought of keeping you
here... without calling him.

665
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,417
Where is that lunatic now?

666
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,750
Talking about espionage
and ass-kicking.

667
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,208
Work is calling.

668
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:27,500
I won't say anything.

669
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,458
I won't say a word or ask
any questions, but get out!

670
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:32,833
What are you doing here?

671
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,542
I am responsible for this,
and I'm leaving.

672
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:37,792
Pierrot returned
to Columbine

673
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:40,083
on tipped toes
goes the harlequin

674
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,625
You can't walk out like this,
there's two cops outside.

675
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:44,542
Are you nuts,
they'll jump right on you!

676
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:46,375
It doesn't matter,

677
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,000
I have what is called
"the surprise factor".

678
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,083
Some couscous with chicken
anyone?

679
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:38,542
First, Mrs. Beaumont,
then the presidential whore,

680
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,667
soon enough we'll be
the only ones in Paris

681
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,792
who didn't meet
Commander Beaumont yet.

682
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,833
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

683
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:48,125
Excuse me, Colonel, but I can't
keep an eye on Mrs. Beaumont,

684
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:51,083
on the presidential whore and
the five miles of hallways

685
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,792
at the Intercontinental
at the same time.

686
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:56,417
The Intercontinental
is no longer safe.

687
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:59,042
We're moving the President
somewhere else.

688
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:02,458
Don't you remember how he
reacted to this idea?

689
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:05,833
Because it was ours,
now it's the higher-up's.

690
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,583
Where are you
going to put him?

691
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:11,792
In the Ferriere castle
in the countryside.

692
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:16,500
Two towers, one main building,
one story and a pavilion,

693
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,458
with a great view.

694
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,875
- And Beaumont?
- What about him?

695
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:23,500
Well, Beaumont, should we stop
him or shouldn't we now?

696
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,917
Of course we should!

697
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:28,333
Why are you asking?

698
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:35,625
I'm not asking you,
Colonel, I'm asking Valera.

699
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:39,250
You're sick
in the head, Rosen!

700
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,583
I think I know what
you're getting at.

701
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:45,667
What are you
interrogating Valera for?

702
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,667
I'm not interrogating him,
Colonel,

703
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:51,625
I'm just asking him
whose side he's on.

704
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:54,667
Our's or Beaumont's?

705
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,667
Just a question!

706
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,792
If I remember correctly,
you and Joss

707
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,917
were very close friends,
weren't you?

708
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,625
What are you
trying to say?

709
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:07,708
I'm simply saying that if
someone he trusts, like Valera,

710
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:14,167
asked Joss Beaumont
for a meeting, he'd come.

711
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:21,500
Isn't that a good idea?

712
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,042
You're even sicker
than I thought!

713
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:31,958
Well, the previous maneuvers
weren't successful.

714
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,042
I'm trying something else.

715
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:37,833
The other tricks didn't work
out, so you invent another one,

716
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:41,667
preferably one that's even
more deceitful than your last.

717
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:48,333
No, Alice...
a meeting is not always a trap.

718
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:57,208
Captain, I think
Inspector Rosen might be right.

719
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:02,083
In any case,
if anybody meets with Beaumont,

720
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:05,000
it will have to be you.

721
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:18,708
All right,
I'll try to contact Joss.

722
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:23,167
But I want you to
promise me something.

723
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:27,667
Give me enough time
to convince him,

724
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:30,083
or at least to try.

725
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:33,333
Of course we will, Edouard!

726
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:36,583
Isn't that right,
Colonel?

727
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,708
Obviously!

728
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:42,333
Edouard,
how can you say that?

729
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:46,250
You know them, you know very
well that they want to kill him.

730
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,417
That's their only purpose,
their only desire.

731
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:52,708
That's why
I want to see him.

732
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:56,042
He's gone too far,
Jeanne.

733
01:05:56,042 --> 01:06:00,292
He has to cut
this bullshit out!

734
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:03,333
If I can't make him
understand that tonight,

735
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:06,250
it's gonna be too late.

736
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,750
Well, I can't
promise anything,

737
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:13,333
but if Joss calls me,
I'll tell him to meet you,

738
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:16,917
but only if you swear
that Joss doesn't have

739
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:21,417
anything to fear
from you.

740
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:23,833
I swear.

741
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:33,000
That's good, Valera.

742
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:47,167
Really good job,
Edouard.

743
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:15,000
Y'know, you're cute when
you pretend you're sleeping.

744
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,792
I'm not pretending, why do
you think I was pretending?

745
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,958
Two years,
Edouard.

746
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,083
Two years, what?

747
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:36,542
You were gonna ask how long it's
been since we saw each other.

748
01:10:36,542 --> 01:10:38,208
Two years.

749
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,792
I know that it's been
two years.

750
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:42,417
What's so funny?

751
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:44,542
Because I'd like to see
Martin's face

752
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:47,625
if he saw us together now.

753
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:55,125
I mean, you can always
hand in your resignation.

754
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:59,583
They won't accept it anyway,
so there's no risk.

755
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,375
Did Jeanne tell you about
my resignation?

756
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:06,750
Yes, and how
it impressed her,

757
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,250
which isn't surprising.

758
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:14,125
I can literally see you
telling her,

759
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:17,292
"Jeanne, I resigned
this morning."

760
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:20,458
Just like you told me
not so long ago,

761
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:25,500
"Joss, I would love to be
in your place and go."

762
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:30,542
You're good at these kind of
scenes, you know that?

763
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:32,333
Do you
have some coffee?

764
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,167
It's ready, I'll get it.

765
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,250
Speaking of Jeanne,
do you think it was

766
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,042
really necessary to go
to her house and see her?

767
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:45,542
Her house, that's funny,
don't forget I live there, too!

768
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:48,375
Oh, look,
the "Condor Interceptor".

769
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,208
Didn't I bring you that
from Hong Kong?

770
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:53,417
Yes.

771
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:56,208
It wasn't your robots
that drove me crazy,

772
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:58,667
it was your batteries.

773
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:03,167
German batteries don't work
in Japanese robots.

774
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:07,875
Batteries from Brittainy don't
work in robots from Auvergne.

775
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:09,750
How's Alice?

776
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,667
Fine, why?

777
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:14,208
Did she decode
my telegram?

778
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,000
Yes.

779
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,792
Did she think
it was funny?

780
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,083
Not, really, no.

781
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:23,042
She would have preferred to have
heard from you before that.

782
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:28,375
Me, too, actually,
everybody would have.

783
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,417
How many do you have now?

784
01:12:30,417 --> 01:12:32,333
What?

785
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:36,417
How many robots
do you have now?

786
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:40,958
Oh, more than a hundred,
a hundred and fifty, maybe.

787
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,833
A small army almost.

788
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:48,375
And cops, how many are here,
around us, everywhere?

789
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:52,625
Also a small army?

790
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:58,417
I don't know,
but there are a lot.

791
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,125
We have some on the roofs,

792
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:04,583
in the unmarked car,
there's Louviers and Farges.

793
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:07,167
You really put him
in his place.

794
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:12,208
In the back there's Ropert,
Dugoineau and Perrin.

795
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,667
Down there,
at the corner of this building,

796
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:15,625
there's Vittoret
and Goulet,

797
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:18,000
In the cafe,
Martin and Michalon.

798
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,042
Why did you come here
if you saw them?

799
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:22,833
Because you asked me to,
Edouard.

800
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:25,583
I wanted to see you
to make you stop

801
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:28,292
before it
is too late, Joss.

802
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:31,000
They'll shoot you
like a dog...

803
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,083
and what for?

804
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:37,417
Things have completely changed
in the last two years,

805
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:40,708
the political
circumstances changed.

806
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:46,583
And... I've changed,
everything has changed.

807
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,917
Except Njala
and the Service.

808
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:51,000
And if it was good
to kill Njala then,

809
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,833
it must still
be good now.

810
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,833
Well, maybe it wasn't good
then, either.

811
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,542
Then you shouldn't have
convinced me that it was!

812
01:13:57,542 --> 01:14:01,750
I don't understand
your stubbornness, Joss.

813
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,958
I'm wondering,
who do you hate more now?

814
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,708
Njala or the Service?

815
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:13,875
Guess.

816
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,708
Enough of this...
how am I gonna get out?

817
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,708
On my feet, of course.

818
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,417
Maybe you could give
me the password,

819
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:22,167
now that you've put
spies all around.

820
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,375
Joss,
you don't understand.

821
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:27,542
It's over, no more,
finito, hopeless.

822
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,917
No, dear Edouard,
it's not over.

823
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,750
It's overdue.

824
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,542
What the hell is this?

825
01:14:54,542 --> 01:14:58,208
The press,
the democratic press.

826
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:01,458
They haven't written anything
about me in two years.

827
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,792
So I suggested they
do a follow-up.

828
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,500
What, what did you tell them?
What did you say?

829
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,250
I told them they
could have live coverage of

830
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:13,000
the execution of an
agent of the Secret Service.

831
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,458
They were
more than happy!

832
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,875
Are you out of your mind?

833
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,625
That is against
all the rules!

834
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,375
Is it in the rules of
the Service

835
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:23,667
to sell one of its agents?

836
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:26,167
And the call you made
to Jeanne this morning,

837
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:29,000
is that part of
the rules, too?

838
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:43,167
Hey guys, thanks
for being on time.

839
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:46,958
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

840
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:50,875
I'd like to inform you
that I'm in good health.

841
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:52,833
I just came back
from my vacation,

842
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,375
I have plenty of friends,

843
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:57,667
and therefore no reason
to commit suicide.

844
01:15:57,667 --> 01:16:00,458
I'm saying this
so you know in case

845
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:03,208
you find me lying
on a doormat.

846
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:07,958
I just need to walk down
two stories to get to you,

847
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:10,292
so I'll see you
in a minute.

848
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:22,542
Why are you doing that?

849
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:23,958
Because I have
to walk downstairs

850
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:26,250
with my back to you.

851
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,333
Joss!

852
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,500
That bastard!

853
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,042
Block the doorway.

854
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:02,958
If you mind the light,
turn it off.

855
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:05,500
Whatever you like,
Colonel,

856
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,708
I can either use
the main entrance,

857
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:11,667
and answer all the questions
that are being asked,

858
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:15,625
or I take the back door
and you call your men back.

859
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,208
Take the back door.

860
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:21,208
In that case, I want a car
and nobody around, got it?

861
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:24,250
Call back Ropert,
Dugoineau, and Perrin.

862
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,833
You, Louviers, bring a car
to the back entrance.

863
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,750
All right.

864
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,125
There you go,
that's much better!

865
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:08,833
I didn't think
Edouard could convince you.

866
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:12,042
It's just a scratch,
it's nothing,

867
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:14,458
but it's bleeding
like crazy.

868
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:29,875
Thank you for
sending me flowers.

869
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:41,292
You see, Alice,
I ran and ran and ran,

870
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:45,667
and I had a plan that
I was not to forget on the road.

871
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:49,833
As soon as I arrived
in Paris, I knew the odds,

872
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:54,042
Colonel Martin's smile,
the fist of Valera.

873
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:56,167
You don't call him
Edouard anymore?

874
01:22:56,167 --> 01:23:00,375
No, I don't call him
Edouard anymore.

875
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:04,583
Valera's fist,
the irreproachable Jeanne,

876
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:07,250
the wonderful Alice,

877
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:12,000
in short, all the reasons why
I couldn't do what I had to.

878
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,375
That's why
I sent the telegram,

879
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:17,875
so that all these reasons
wouldn't exist,

880
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:21,375
so that my craziness
would be irreparable.

881
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:25,625
A guy's allowed
to change his mind.

882
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:32,667
My point exactly.
Even if I did, what for?

883
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:36,417
The machine
already started running.

884
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:40,542
There's just screams,
orders, targets.

885
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:44,000
There's only two targets,
Njala and me.

886
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:47,500
I must admit,
I wish there was only one.

887
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:53,333
Earlier the door,
now the window...

888
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:55,083
Do you really think that
anyone would be sick enough

889
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:57,542
to look for you here?

890
01:23:57,542 --> 01:24:03,792
I know two sick guys,
Rosen and Farges,

891
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:08,125
especially Rosen.

892
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:14,000
What if we both left,
what would Rosen find here?

893
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,792
Well, there's a few things we
could do, we could make plans,

894
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:23,833
take an airplanes,
and get out the sunscreen.

895
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:27,625
But unfortunately,
today's the 15th,

896
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:30,833
and I have an appointment
at a palace in Paris

897
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,708
to kill a president.

898
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:35,375
You're right,
it's the 15th,

899
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:38,083
but you no longer have
an advantage on the others.

900
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:40,542
In fact,
you have a disadvantage.

901
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:45,792
Your president
is not in the palace anymore.

902
01:24:45,792 --> 01:24:47,500
He's at
the Ferriere Castle,

903
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,792
five miles outside
of Rambouillet,

904
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,625
in Yvelines.

905
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:57,833
By now they should be digging
pits, putting bags of sand up.

906
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:59,417
What is it?

907
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:01,917
You seem surprised.

908
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:04,667
Did you think they'd
give you an update?

909
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:06,625
Are there many
of them down there?

910
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:11,625
Well, the cops, special squads,
Rosen's bloodhounds,

911
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,792
oh, and a pilot!

912
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:17,375
A pilot?

913
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,958
Yes, I think
they're planning to have

914
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:21,792
Miss Doris Anderson
come there.

915
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,167
Frederiksen.

916
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:30,458
Right, to have Miss Frederiksen
come by helicopter.

917
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,250
There you go,

918
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:39,458
that's what we should have
started with, my dear Alice...

919
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:43,125
the helicopter!

920
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:56,458
I'm sure I'll hit him,
I'm positive!

921
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:58,833
Where can he go?

922
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:01,583
I'd know if he was
in the hotel.

923
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:04,083
I'd know if
he was at his wife's.

924
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,333
He doesn't have
any friends left.

925
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,542
Listen, you take care
of Beaumont,

926
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:12,417
and I'll go keep an eye
on the President.

927
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,083
Farges and Valera
are there already,

928
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:18,333
at the castle,
I'll join them.

929
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:22,625
Poor Valera,
I feel for him.

930
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:25,083
Colonel, Miss Ancelin
is asking to be excused.

931
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:27,250
She won't be able
to come in today.

932
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,042
What's wrong with her?

933
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:32,583
I don't know, she doesn't
feel well, she's tired.

934
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:38,917
Overworked, maybe?

935
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:04,333
Rosen.

936
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:15,667
I told you I'd always
be right behind you.

937
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,500
Excuse me, gentlemen.

938
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:55,708
Do you know where I can find
Dr. Touchard, please?

939
01:28:55,708 --> 01:29:02,417
I looked at the...
the apartment listings...

940
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:09,500
I came to leave these.

941
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,792
Well, I'll go to ask
at the front desk

942
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:18,167
for that information.

943
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,875
Excuse me.

944
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:17,333
No I.D.

945
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:20,083
Hello, hello,
no I.D.

946
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:24,625
Just dog tags under the name of
Commander Josselin Beaumont.

947
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:29,125
The first reports say that the
officer was killed by a bullet.

948
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:31,250
Oh, shit!

949
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:36,250
He was wearing dog tags
with the number 322460,

950
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:41,208
registered under the name
of Josselin Beaumont.

951
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:46,292
The first reports show that
he's been killed by a bullet.

952
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:54,500
I don't understand how he could
fall into such a trap

953
01:30:54,500 --> 01:31:00,250
because a direct confrontation
is unthinkable... by a bullet.

954
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,792
I'd like to meet
whoever did that!

955
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:04,917
Is that all it says
in the report?

956
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:07,167
It also says
that the body is at

957
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:09,625
The Institute
for Legal Medicine.

958
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:12,083
By the way,
tell Colonel Martin

959
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:14,292
that I won't go
to identify the body.

960
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:15,583
That's his business!

961
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,167
He knows how I feel
about this.

962
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:19,292
Calm down,
I'll tell him!

963
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:26,792
We knew this would
go badly, didn't we?

964
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:29,208
Why was he so stubborn?

965
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,917
Okay, Farges, you're
off to Paris.

966
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:41,625
Go to the morgue
to identify Beaumont's body.

967
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,042
Yes, what is it?

968
01:31:43,042 --> 01:31:45,000
Your Excellency
would like to know

969
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,917
if all the measures
have been taken

970
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:50,833
concerning the helicopter
for Miss Frederiksen?

971
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:54,625
What the hell should I care
about his stupid whore?

972
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:55,958
Yes, yes,
everything is ready.

973
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:58,208
He just needs to whistle
and she'll land on the lawn.

974
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:00,500
So, is that good enough,
Arthur?

975
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,208
Yes, very well.

976
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,375
Isn't all this going
a little too far?

977
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:21,458
We'll send all these people
back to their normal posts.

978
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:24,667
The regular service
is more than enough

979
01:32:24,667 --> 01:32:27,667
to protect this whorehouse.

980
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:37,583
Oh, my god!

981
01:32:49,875 --> 01:32:51,208
Hello?

982
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:54,167
Give me Colonel Martin,
immediately!

983
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:56,875
Hello, Colonel?

984
01:32:56,875 --> 01:33:00,625
Hello, Farges,
hello, Farges?

985
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:02,333
It was me that you saw
laying on that table.

986
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:05,375
Hello?

987
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:11,458
Colonel... I did identify
Beaumont, it was him.

988
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:17,500
What's up, Farges?
Your voice sounds funny.

989
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,375
I liked Beaumont.

990
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,083
Well good,
see you in a bit.

991
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:23,208
Let's go!

992
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:35,625
I didn't believe Rosen when
he told me he had hit Beaumont.

993
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:39,417
He's a strange cop,
that Rosen,

994
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:43,208
a real ass,
but what a cop!

995
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,958
Meet me at the office.

996
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,958
I'll give the good news
to his Excellency.

997
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:56,500
What time will the helicopter
with the girl land?

998
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,750
Three-thirty, why?

999
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:03,708
Because we'll make plans
according to that.

1000
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:09,583
Relax, Inspector, relax,
isn't it nice to be driving?

1001
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:13,667
Breath in,
it smells like springtime!

1002
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:16,083
When we pass the gate,

1003
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,208
try to look as natural
as you look dumb!

1004
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:21,833
You hear me,
natural!

1005
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,167
See that, the Colonel's
sending his men home.

1006
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:32,792
The path is clear.

1007
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:40,625
Don't forget what
I told you, natural!

1008
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:42,500
Now you're pushing it,
that's almost friendly.

1009
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:47,167
Thank you!

1010
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,792
Stop in front of
the entrance stairs.

1011
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:56,042
Where are
the president's rooms?

1012
01:34:56,042 --> 01:34:58,667
Do you want to end up
in a freezer like Rosen?

1013
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:00,917
Where are Njala's apartments?

1014
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:05,167
First floor, opposite
the stairs, the large windows.

1015
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:09,417
The helicopter, does it land
in front of it or behind?

1016
01:35:09,417 --> 01:35:10,833
There, on the grass.

1017
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,792
Wait.

1018
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,542
Hello.

1019
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,083
What are
we gonna do now?

1020
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:07,875
My respects, Colonel.

1021
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,917
Beaumont.

1022
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:12,417
So, who was it
at the morgue?

1023
01:36:12,417 --> 01:36:15,125
Rosen,
disappointed?

1024
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:18,708
Rosen, yes,
very much so.

1025
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:21,167
I was just saying
what a great cop he was.

1026
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,875
Oh, but we're all
great guys.

1027
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:26,083
Now, if you could just
hand me your weapon,

1028
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:28,292
with only two fingers,
just like on TV.

1029
01:36:33,917 --> 01:36:36,292
You don't know how much
pleasure it gives me

1030
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:38,542
to see you in such
a picturesque palace

1031
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,833
for this, the final act
of our drama.

1032
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:46,583
It was Njala who arranged it,
so we should go thank him.

1033
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:48,125
Go ahead.

1034
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:07,875
You can leave us now, Colonel,
you have other things to do.

1035
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:09,750
Go listen to Farges'
explanations and excuses,

1036
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,792
put your elite hitmen
on the roof.

1037
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:15,792
In other words, the usual
calm before the storm.

1038
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:16,917
Tell the Minister,

1039
01:37:16,917 --> 01:37:20,375
as soon as all that shit
is in place.

1040
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:21,750
Come in!

1041
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:24,125
I would love to chat
a little longer,

1042
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:26,542
but you never make
his Excellency wait.

1043
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:36,583
Don't turn the light on and
above alI don't speak, Arthur!

1044
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:38,458
I'm not Arthur.

1045
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:49,292
How can I help you,
Commander Beaumont?

1046
01:37:49,292 --> 01:37:52,208
Open the curtains,
turn on the light,

1047
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:54,875
and die,
Mr. President.

1048
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,958
I can see the corner
of an office

1049
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,042
and make out a silhouette.

1050
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:04,875
They just
turned a light on.

1051
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:06,708
Is that a signal,
or what?

1052
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:08,250
I'm sure the President
had the clever idea

1053
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,500
to make the other idiot
stand in broad daylight,

1054
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,208
so I can kill him
with one shot.

1055
01:38:15,917 --> 01:38:18,625
Farges, you should know
if it's him.

1056
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,792
You just saw him at the morgue,
where he was dead.

1057
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:22,458
I told you that
I had a gun pointed here.

1058
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:24,958
Do you know how that feels
to have a gun right here?

1059
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:27,458
That's not like invoices
or reports, or numbers.

1060
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:29,500
It's a gun!

1061
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:34,042
The curtains are open,
can you see anything?

1062
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:36,833
If I see Beaumont's gun peeking
through the curtain, I'll shoot.

1063
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,708
How much more
time do we have?

1064
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:48,083
You, about ten minutes,
not more.

1065
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,458
And quite frankly,
I don't see any reason

1066
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:51,125
why you
should live any longer!

1067
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:53,583
My country needs me!

1068
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:55,917
No country needs
a tyrant.

1069
01:38:55,917 --> 01:38:59,125
Word of your death will
trigger joy among your people.

1070
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:00,875
They'll dance
in the streets.

1071
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:04,708
They'll burn you in effigy under
the coconut tree of freedom.

1072
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:07,458
There'll be no regrets.

1073
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:11,833
I have one, the regret
of not having killed you.

1074
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:15,208
That I really regret!

1075
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,625
I often ask myself
why I didn't do it.

1076
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,708
Maybe for
religious reasons?

1077
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:25,667
No, I think I saved you in order
to trade you in one day.

1078
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:27,792
But for what?

1079
01:39:27,792 --> 01:39:30,667
You don't represent
any value to me.

1080
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:33,542
That's exactly what
misled you thus far,

1081
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:35,500
your system of values--

1082
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:38,458
the good, the bad,
the kind, the evil--

1083
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:41,375
in short,
the general concept of values.

1084
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:43,542
Here we are,

1085
01:39:43,542 --> 01:39:47,250
and we're heading toward
the most simple solution.

1086
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:51,000
Unfortunately, for you,
it's the final solution.

1087
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,167
So, what are you
waiting for?

1088
01:39:55,167 --> 01:39:57,417
The helicopter.

1089
01:40:17,667 --> 01:40:19,875
I'm not asking you
to take a message!

1090
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:22,333
I'm asking you to put
the Minister on the phone!

1091
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:24,500
Let me speak to
the Minister, Miss!

1092
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:28,458
You're something else!

1093
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:31,458
It took you French three
revolutions and five republics

1094
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:35,583
to achieve some semblance
of democracy,

1095
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:39,750
and you want me
to achieve it in one day!

1096
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:42,292
I don't care.

1097
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,000
I don't want to hear
all this chatter

1098
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,208
about ethics, morals
and comparative history.

1099
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,792
I don't give a shit.

1100
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,667
You see?

1101
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:57,000
Even your cleverness
won't save you now!

1102
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,917
Call them!

1103
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:09,583
What's going on?

1104
01:41:09,583 --> 01:41:11,083
I don't know,
I don't understand,

1105
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:12,500
something's going on.

1106
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,500
Yes.

1107
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,333
Captain,
it's President Njala.

1108
01:41:18,625 --> 01:41:19,917
Hello?

1109
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:22,000
When we come out, we don't
want to see anybody,

1110
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,917
not on the stairs, not in
the hall, not on the lawns.

1111
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,042
And the helicopter has to be
ready to leave.

1112
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:31,458
And the helicopter
ready to go.

1113
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:33,208
Give me Beaumont.

1114
01:41:33,208 --> 01:41:35,625
He wants
to talk to you.

1115
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,417
Hello?

1116
01:41:40,417 --> 01:41:42,625
Hello, Joss.

1117
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:44,958
We may never
see each other again.

1118
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:46,583
Why not?

1119
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:49,000
Invite me over,
it's always a great time.

1120
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,292
Is there anything I could say
to make you change your mind?

1121
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:54,292
I can't think of anything,

1122
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:56,958
but I'll give it a thought,
I promise.

1123
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:00,042
Go ahead,
let's get it over with.

1124
01:42:00,042 --> 01:42:02,292
Get it over with?

1125
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:05,958
Okay, but I never intended
to kill you.

1126
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:09,583
Oh, really, so what's
that in your hand?

1127
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:12,458
This, it's empty,
Mr. President.

1128
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:22,667
I can see his gun.

1129
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,333
I don't understand
anything anymore!

1130
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:29,958
You will very soon,
Mr. President.

1131
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:37,167
I got him!

1132
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:39,000
I'm telling you,
I got him!

1133
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,792
One second,
Mr. Minister.

1134
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:00,875
No one moves, wait
for further instructions.

1135
01:43:09,333 --> 01:43:12,417
Hello, Minister?

1136
01:43:12,458 --> 01:43:16,333
President Njala is dead.

1137
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:20,208
No, Inspector Farges.

1138
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:26,792
No, no, it's not a mistake,
it's some sort of a scheme.

1139
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:30,000
Everyone stay put
and wait for my instructions!

1140
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:37,167
Are we being tapped?

1141
01:43:37,167 --> 01:43:39,292
Of course, Minister!

1142
01:43:39,292 --> 01:43:42,042
Don't shoot!

1143
01:43:42,042 --> 01:43:45,542
No one moves without
an order to do so!

1144
01:43:45,542 --> 01:43:48,333
I am waiting
for your order.

1145
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:52,917
There's a helicopter
ready for takeoff,

1146
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:54,875
and Beaumont is going
to take it.

1147
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:04,917
Of course,
so what should I do?

1148
01:44:04,917 --> 01:44:07,500
Colonel, do whatever
you think is necessary.

1149
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,667
I don't know
anymore, sir!

1150
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:11,417
I'm out of it now.

1151
01:44:11,417 --> 01:44:14,083
My resignation will be on
your desk before six o'clock.

1152
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:16,375
So, what are you going to do,
Mr. Minister?

1153
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,792
What can be done?

1154
01:44:17,792 --> 01:44:19,583
Well, we can kill him
or let him leave,

1155
01:44:19,583 --> 01:44:21,333
but that's up to you, now.

1156
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,708
What's going on here?

1157
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:29,292
Rosen is dead.

1158
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:31,875
Njala is dead.

1159
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:34,875
And they're deciding my fate
as we speak.

1160
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,333
Come to Paris with me.

1161
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:43,667
No.

1162
01:44:43,667 --> 01:44:46,208
But if I were you, I wouldn't
stay in the line of fire.

1163
01:44:51,417 --> 01:44:54,625
Minister, we only
have a few seconds.

1164
01:44:54,625 --> 01:44:57,792
Well, there's
a criminal aspect to it,

1165
01:44:57,792 --> 01:44:59,750
but also
the political aspect,

1166
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,667
especially after the comments
that Beaumont made to the press.

1167
01:45:02,667 --> 01:45:04,292
Well, shit,
what am I gonna do?

1168
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:19,958
We have to stop him!

1169
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:21,625
Is that an order?

1170
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:25,208
I'm ordering
you to stop him!

1171
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:28,833
Farges,
we have to stop him!
