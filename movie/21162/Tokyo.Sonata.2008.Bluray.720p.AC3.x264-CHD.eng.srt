1
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,070
It's a real storm

2
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,409
Hey, take this

3
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,511
Yes

4
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,966
Who's in charge of the body-fat scale?

5
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,981
I think it's Shimada san

6
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,376
Right

7
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:58,281
We're here from Dalian, China

8
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,428
I'm Shao Yen

9
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:01,826
Nice to meet you

10
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:03,216
Your Japanese is good

11
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:06,935
We've been studying night and day

12
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:10,063
As soon as the telephone lines
to Dalian are installed,

13
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,357
you can hire 3 young locals

14
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:16,493
like her for what you pay one
Japanese employee here

15
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:17,640
I understand

16
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,512
That sounds good

17
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,512
Excuse me

18
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:37,521
We're going forward with the plan to move

19
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,781
the Administration Dept. to Dalian

20
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,379
I see

21
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:48,191
I'm aware of the great job you've done
as the director of Administration

22
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,937
So, Sasaki san,

23
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,160
what will you do after
you leave Administration?

24
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:55,630
What?

25
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,225
What are your skills?

26
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:01,260
You tell me

27
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,997
What can you contribute
to our Tanita Corporation?

28
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,639
It's entirely up to you

29
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,023
Either you contribute your fullest here

30
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:18,531
or you leave our company

31
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:26,493
About that air conditioning estimate

32
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:28,092
Oh, that
Yes

33
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:32,541
I think we should accept
Uchida System's bid

34
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,484
What do you think, Director?

35
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:42,968
Can I have that?

36
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:43,663
What?

37
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:45,506
That

38
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:46,820
Right

39
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,798
Did you visit Hello Work?

40
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,189
No

41
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,735
You've got to stop by Hello Work
before you come here

42
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,472
Oh, right

43
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:44,732
Go before your luck runs out

44
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:49,069
Otherwise, you'll be stuck here
for life, like me

45
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:17,018
Reception Closed for Today

46
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:00,710
Hey

47
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:07,934
It's open

48
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,204
You sure carry a lot around

49
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:21,939
It's too heavy

50
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,109
I'm home

51
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,147
Honey!

52
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,025
When did you get home?

53
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,936
Just now

54
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,404
Don't surprise me like that

55
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:39,211
Did you get off work early?

56
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,278
Yeah

57
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:47,901
What are you doing?

58
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,744
Just making sure all the doors are locked

59
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:52,723
I see

60
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,703
That's all

61
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,215
Anything wrong?

62
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,092
No

63
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,936
But you could use the front door

64
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,582
You're right

65
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:09,971
Thanks for the food

66
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,215
Sure

67
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:14,977
I'm off

68
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,956
Off you go

69
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,391
Will you be home early again today?

70
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:44,172
No, I've got a busy day

71
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,275
I see

72
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,057
Takashi?

73
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:48,690
Not yet

74
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,218
He's a mess

75
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,375
I'm off

76
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,761
Off you go

77
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:29,971
See ya

78
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,919
I'm home

79
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,021
Welcome home

80
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,507
Hungry?

81
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,786
No thanks

82
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:59,029
I'm going to bed Don't vacuum

83
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:04,773
So, on to the topic of mastering
honorific diction

84
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:09,222
Keigo diction is the skillful use
of 3 different types

85
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:13,984
of honorific speech in order to show
respect to the other person

86
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:19,093
We want you to use respectful language
to your elders,

87
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:22,152
so we'll investigate
the meaning of each...

88
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:24,510
Sasaki, what is that?

89
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,356
Show me

90
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:38,967
Ridiculous

91
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:44,217
I profoundly despise anyone
who would sneak this into my classroom

92
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,108
Stand

93
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:48,766
But...

94
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,066
You have no right to attend my class

95
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,197
Go stand in the back

96
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,901
That's not mine

97
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,882
Is that an excuse?

98
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,064
It's true

99
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,254
I was just passing it on

100
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,095
I told you to stand

101
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,932
In the back, hurry

102
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,571
Teacher

103
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:07,892
What?

104
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:11,708
I saw you reading porn manga
on the train the other day

105
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:16,234
I was sitting in front of you

106
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,050
You were trying hard to hide it,

107
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,114
but I could see the cover,
"Weekly Eros Mania"

108
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,827
Why do you say that?

109
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,936
Because it's true

110
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:33,570
He's got balls

111
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,732
This is hardly the place

112
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:39,069
You're right

113
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,692
It's not fair

114
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:42,819
Quiet!

115
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:44,966
Back to the lesson

116
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:50,053
So, honorific diction

117
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:53,806
Let's conjugate standard
diction into honorific

118
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:56,129
OK? Start with "To see"

119
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:58,915
Sasaki, you're amazing!

120
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:01,105
He looked so scared What a laugh

121
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:03,120
Let's call him Ero-Bayashi

122
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Excellent

123
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,979
Ero-Bayashi! Ero-Bayashi!

124
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:11,766
Ero-Bayashi!

125
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:19,696
What?

126
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:22,828
I'm sorry about before

127
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:24,001
Right

128
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,234
I went too far

129
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,041
I didn't think the other kids

130
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,020
would react like that

131
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:32,282
You came to say that?

132
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:33,637
Yes

133
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,165
All this way?

134
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:39,958
Forget it

135
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,057
You'll graduate in less than a year

136
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:45,559
It's not going to change
how we get along

137
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,925
But that manga really isn't mine

138
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:55,708
So I didn't think it was fair
that I was the only one

139
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,651
who had to stand

140
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:03,633
Sasaki, let's stop poking at
each other's wounds

141
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,900
You can ignore me
and I'll ignore you, too

142
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,452
You got that?

143
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:35,713
Let's stop

144
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:39,293
More distinction between crescendo
and decrescendo, OK?

145
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:40,845
Again, from here

146
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:47,490
That's right, continue

147
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:54,235
A little stronger here

148
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,816
What was that other piece in C Major,

149
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,701
that you learned to play so well?

150
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,810
Let's see...

151
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,233
We're sorry to keep you waiting

152
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:40,465
Will the person holding ticket number 86

153
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:43,760
please proceed to window...

154
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:48,564
Your hours are midnight to 9
in the morning

155
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:50,580
Security guard at a factory

156
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,125
There's never been
a single robbery there

157
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,890
So you don't have to worry

158
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,065
Sasaki san,
how about administrative work?

159
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,664
I'm much more suited to that

160
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:08,508
Well,

161
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,782
maybe this is perfect for you

162
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:13,277
Please

163
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:15,457
A manager at a Happy Mart store,

164
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,968
Monday through Friday,

165
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:21,305
from 7 AM through 3PM 850 Yen an hour

166
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:24,225
I wrote it in the form I gave you,

167
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:28,326
but I used to be Administrative Director
at Tanita

168
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,628
It's not easy to say this,

169
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:35,551
but it's 100% impossible you'll match
your former position

170
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,534
We're sorry to keep you waiting

171
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,300
Here you go

172
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:15,456
Here's this month's salary

173
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:16,486
Thanks

174
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,352
I think it's time for a new stove

175
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:29,666
Yeah

176
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:34,013
I guess it can wait 'til your Bonus

177
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,537
Where's Takashi?

178
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:50,317
He left this afternoon
for one of his classes

179
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,020
I see

180
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,280
I hope he's not getting into trouble

181
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,523
Right

182
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,321
Your qualifying exams are coming up?

183
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,087
Yeah

184
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,489
Hang in there

185
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,795
Maybe I'll play piano

186
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,221
I want to play piano

187
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,501
It's OK, right?

188
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:31,435
No

189
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,172
Why not?

190
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:34,760
It's just a whim

191
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:43,348
Maybe you should
play in music class at school

192
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,480
No means no

193
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,317
Welcome home

194
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,596
I'm home

195
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,210
I've saved your meal

196
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,011
Yeah, I'll eat it

197
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,062
Look

198
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,081
What?

199
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:45,641
You got your driver's license

200
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,727
But you won't use it

201
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,227
It's just a form of identification

202
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,643
An expensive form of identification

203
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,207
Use your insurance card

204
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,830
I like this one better

205
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,672
It's rice porridge today

206
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,023
Hello

207
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,101
Hello

208
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,057
It's cold today, isn't it?

209
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,482
Sure is

210
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:16,077
Please wait a little longer

211
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,598
Hello, hello

212
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,788
Thanks for your patience

213
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,421
Here you are

214
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:26,063
Thanks for your patience

215
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:27,628
Sorry to keep you waiting

216
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:28,942
Here you are

217
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:50,081
Hey, Kurosu?

218
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:51,888
I thought it was you, Sasaki

219
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,689
Long time no see

220
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,136
You haven't changed since high school

221
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:58,902
Neither have you

222
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:01,994
Sorry

223
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,748
Hello

224
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:11,386
Sure, OK

225
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,408
I'm meeting with a client right now

226
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:18,025
I'll talk to the Senior V.P. about
that myself

227
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:21,675
And don't worry about
the bid on the Municipal Hall

228
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:24,412
Sure, sure, thanks

229
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:26,818
You dropped this

230
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,313
Oh, thanks

231
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,529
You seem busy

232
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,728
You're in construction?

233
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,742
Something like that

234
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,254
What about you?

235
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:40,027
Healthcare equipment

236
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,242
Sounds great

237
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,445
Hey, what's that?

238
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:58,479
I think they're giving away food

239
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:01,956
You'd be surprised how many guys line up

240
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,093
Maybe I'll check it out

241
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,010
It's a rare chance to taste it

242
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,348
Are you by any chance, unemployed?

243
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:33,273
You can tell?

244
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:34,838
Yeah

245
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:36,189
Right

246
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:39,495
You are, too, right?

247
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:42,375
Yeah Got down-sized last week

248
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,889
I got downsized 3 months ago

249
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,286
What about that phone call?

250
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:53,838
That's just for show

251
00:21:56,595 --> 00:22:00,660
I do it to calm my nerves

252
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:02,887
I know it's stupid

253
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:05,103
No, it was amazing

254
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,618
Aren't you going to eat that?

255
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:14,287
I already ate

256
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:15,602
Yeah...

257
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:19,709
It tastes lousy, right?

258
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,296
Yeah...

259
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:23,729
It's lousy

260
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:40,696
You can stay here as long as you want

261
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:52,232
Excuse me

262
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:16,571
I set up my phone
to ring 5 times an hour

263
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,170
I didn't know you could

264
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,881
It's not a very well-known feature,

265
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:23,210
so it fools most people

266
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,868
Oh, I see

267
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:28,945
Have you told your wife yet?

268
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:30,613
No

269
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:32,073
You hand her the monthly cash?

270
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:32,907
Yeah

271
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:36,209
That means you'll last for a while

272
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,773
Your severance pay?

273
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:39,267
Have they paid it all?

274
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,760
Not yet

275
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:44,725
Set up a separate bank account for it

276
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:47,505
Any irregular deposits will stand out

277
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:48,861
Unemployment insurance?

278
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,085
I'm just applying now

279
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:54,839
Make sure to submit
all the paperwork on time

280
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,090
One day late and you're disqualified

281
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:01,435
Oops

282
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,891
You're really amazing

283
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:15,926
Ero-Bayashi

284
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,853
Now, Kobayashi's totally lost
his authority over us

285
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:23,883
Yeah

286
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:27,962
This is like a revolution

287
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:29,665
A revolution!

288
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:31,264
Yeah

289
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:33,106
What's wrong?

290
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:35,215
You're the one that started it all

291
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:15,679
Kenji?

292
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,845
Welcome home

293
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,148
Kenji,

294
00:25:57,148 --> 00:26:00,415
I'm making donuts
Why don't you come down?

295
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,730
I'm fine

296
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,142
Don't you want to eat donuts?

297
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:06,564
No thanks

298
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:11,391
Thanks for the food

299
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:23,703
Thanks

300
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:25,017
Hey Kenji

301
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:29,125
Your monthly lunch money
Put it in your bag

302
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,783
It's due tomorrow, right?

303
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,615
In China, a massive natural gas
development project...

304
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:49,345
Want a donut?

305
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,815
Let's examine China's current energy
sources breakdown

306
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:01,762
In fact, China is

307
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:04,612
the largest producer of coal
in the world,

308
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:06,766
and the world's
6th largest oil producer...

309
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,318
How about a donut?

310
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,328
In 1 990,

311
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:16,151
they depended on coal for 76% of
their energy,

312
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:19,175
and 17% on oil

313
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,295
But by 2002,

314
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:26,195
their coal dependency was reduced to 65%

315
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:32,239
and their oil dependency rose to 24% ...

316
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,975
You were having a nightmare

317
00:27:55,705 --> 00:28:01,228
Kaneko Piano School

318
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:11,029
I'd like to pay for a month of lessons

319
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:13,561
Thank you

320
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,663
Did you come alone?

321
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:21,251
They said I'm in 6th grade now,
so I'm on my own

322
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,962
OK, we'll start next week

323
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:25,241
OK

324
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,934
Do you have a piano at home?

325
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,363
Yes, a small one

326
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:43,769
Come here

327
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,121
Can you play anything?

328
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:00,069
Try playing

329
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:10,327
Keep playing

330
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,803
I'm home

331
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,355
Welcome home

332
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:34,344
Takashi, you're home

333
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:35,631
That's rare

334
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:36,743
I don't have work today

335
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:38,064
Right

336
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:39,593
Do you want to shower first?

337
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,216
No, I'll eat now

338
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:43,938
Kenji, it's dinnertime

339
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:45,845
Come on down

340
00:29:50,993 --> 00:29:53,387
Takashi, your book

341
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:11,604
I'll have a beer

342
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:13,191
I'll get it

343
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,570
Sure tasty

344
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:05,964
Let's eat

345
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,208
Let's eat

346
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,001
It's bad

347
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:21,361
I'm starting to
get home early these days

348
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:23,091
Yeah?

349
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,992
Think she knows?

350
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:28,209
What?

351
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:30,155
Has my wife figured it out?

352
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,005
Just because you get home
a little early? No

353
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:36,723
She stares at me
with eyes full of mistrust

354
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:39,567
I'm telling you, it's bad

355
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,065
I have to find a way to
make her trust me

356
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:49,514
Let me treat you to dinner

357
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:51,148
What do you want?

358
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:54,832
Please, come to my house

359
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:56,183
OK?

360
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:06,545
I'm home

361
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:08,168
Welcome

362
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,125
Hello

363
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,470
My daughter, Mika

364
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,887
Good evening

365
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:16,312
Good evening

366
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:17,146
Junior High?

367
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:18,467
I'm in 8th grade

368
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:21,003
You're so tall

369
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,182
Hey, didn't you order sushi?

370
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:39,912
But you said a home cooked meal was fine

371
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:42,507
I guess I did

372
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:48,172
It's a delicious meal

373
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:03,747
Oh, no, a job-related call at this hour

374
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:13,279
Do you put in overtime every day, too?

375
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,016
Well, yes

376
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:18,944
Is the company doing that well?

377
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:21,373
All of us employees are working hard

378
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:27,073
My husband won't tell me
anything about it

379
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:35,696
The company's doing fine
You don't need to worry

380
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,355
I see

381
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,126
Sasaki san,

382
00:33:42,927 --> 00:33:47,229
please look after my husband

383
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:50,358
I will

384
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,650
That was our president,
calling about that estimate

385
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,636
You're the one that wrote it up,
right, Sasaki?

386
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,679
You need to be more diligent

387
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,536
I covered for you this time
as best I could

388
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:18,159
Get it together, OK?

389
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,119
I will

390
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,520
Please, use this

391
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,251
Oh, thank you

392
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:58,444
You have it rough, don't you?

393
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:57,783
The Tokyo National Museum was...

394
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,062
I'm home

395
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,221
The main building was

396
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:09,345
constructed in 1 938

397
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:15,501
It is a magnificent edifice,
exuding authority

398
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:22,595
Stepping inside, visitors are...

399
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:26,354
Welcome home

400
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:27,633
I'm home

401
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:32,019
Didn't you eat dinner?

402
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,334
No

403
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,320
I thought I'd make tempura

404
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,719
It's been a while

405
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,829
You'll eat, right?

406
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:43,793
No, I already ate

407
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:45,979
I see

408
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:50,641
My boss invited me out after the meeting

409
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,881
I'm really wiped

410
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,303
I'm going to bed

411
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,291
I'll go to bed, too

412
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,586
Pull me up

413
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:13,790
Somebody, please pull me up

414
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,344
Sasaki Ryuhei, please

415
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,411
Yes

416
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:32,357
You're 46 years old?

417
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:34,094
Yes

418
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:36,423
What can you do?

419
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,613
I'm willing to do anything

420
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:41,603
That's too vague

421
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:44,765
We want to know your specific skills

422
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,222
What?

423
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:51,612
We want you to show us what you excel at

424
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:53,107
Right here?

425
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,776
Yes, right now

426
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:59,148
Do you mean like singing Karaoke?

427
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:06,106
What skills can you contribute
to this company?

428
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:08,435
That's what we want to see

429
00:38:08,435 --> 00:38:09,756
Not right here, now...

430
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:15,030
Then how are we expected to
judge your merits?

431
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:23,067
I've worked in administration

432
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,021
so I'm confident of
my interpersonal skills

433
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:28,592
I see, what else?

434
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:32,930
What else...

435
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:36,692
Did you really do nothing to prepare,

436
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,742
figuring you might just get lucky?

437
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:40,270
No

438
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,045
I understand

439
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:46,135
Your Karaoke is fine Please sing

440
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:52,331
Start singing What's wrong?

441
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,458
You're good at it, right?

442
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:01,854
Use that pen instead of
a microphone and sing

443
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,658
When you think about it,

444
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:49,609
we're like a slowly sinking ship

445
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:56,841
The lifeboats are long gone,

446
00:39:56,841 --> 00:40:01,285
the water's up to our mouths

447
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:05,322
We know it's hopeless,

448
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,237
but we're still looking for an exit

449
00:40:10,606 --> 00:40:13,803
But then, we don't have the courage to
dive underwater, either

450
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:16,062
Tell me, Kurosu, why is it?

451
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:18,009
I'm prepared to accept anything

452
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:20,888
But why aren't
they prepared to accept us?

453
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:30,062
The lifeboats are gone

454
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:35,353
They loaded them up with women,
children and young people

455
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:36,775
They're gone

456
00:40:50,645 --> 00:40:52,835
It folds up like this,

457
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:56,102
making a perfect space for bicycles

458
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:59,681
Your whole family could go car camping

459
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:04,375
It's really great Get away with
just the family

460
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,705
That's exactly what this car
is perfect for

461
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:14,245
This car is all the rage now

462
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:16,191
But most people find it

463
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:22,021
more attractive as a second car,
than as the family car

464
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:30,847
Check out this handy feature

465
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:39,232
The roof goes away?

466
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:09,048
Please, please

467
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:14,236
Please

468
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:18,052
Please

469
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,000
I can't get rid of any

470
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,778
All gone

471
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:27,880
When's that giant earthquake coming?

472
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,126
The one that'll
turn everything upside down,

473
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:34,420
beat up all those arrogant bastards,

474
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,436
and make me Prime Minister,

475
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:39,553
so I can pass a No Helmet law

476
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:44,667
Yes, I understand

477
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:48,772
I'll notify my lawyer

478
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:50,790
Yes

479
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:55,239
Good bye, then

480
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:57,220
I won't contact you,

481
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,614
so please don't call me, either

482
00:44:00,488 --> 00:44:01,495
OK

483
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:03,643
Good bye

484
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,208
I'm sorry

485
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,973
That's all for today's lesson

486
00:44:28,745 --> 00:44:30,238
Thank you

487
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,920
Don't worry about me

488
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,310
But...

489
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,569
You're worried?

490
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:56,157
Sure, you are

491
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,112
I went and got a divorce

492
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:06,769
Our marriage was over,
so it doesn't really change anything

493
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:09,689
Once, he was a stranger, and now,

494
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:13,130
we're back to being strangers again

495
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,092
You're not going to see him again?

496
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,687
No, never again

497
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,321
That's what marriage is like

498
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,161
I understand

499
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,021
You do?

500
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:31,760
What do you understand?

501
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,746
How you feel

502
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:37,908
You do, huh?

503
00:45:40,622 --> 00:45:44,619
Recently, I feel calmer being alone, too

504
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:49,451
When I'm with someone,
I end up saying the wrong thing

505
00:45:49,451 --> 00:45:52,188
and we both get hurt

506
00:45:53,135 --> 00:45:56,993
It's time for you to go home and study

507
00:45:56,993 --> 00:45:58,272
See ya

508
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:09,540
Hey

509
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,784
What?

510
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:13,916
I need to ask you a favor

511
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,451
This is the Japanese version

512
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:36,512
You're signing up for
the American military?

513
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:37,763
Yeah

514
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:41,864
There's a new policy
You don't have to be an American

515
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:43,771
You saw it on TV, right?

516
00:46:44,297 --> 00:46:45,885
It's news to me

517
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:50,380
I...

518
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,516
Already passed the paper test

519
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:55,315
Wait a minute

520
00:46:55,315 --> 00:47:00,695
I only have to pass the physical exam
and the thought exam and I'm in

521
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,491
If you're in the military,

522
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,472
you go to war, right?

523
00:47:06,472 --> 00:47:08,309
It depends

524
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:13,973
But you should have consulted us before

525
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:20,966
Have you told your father?

526
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,245
No

527
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:24,086
I see

528
00:47:26,214 --> 00:47:29,272
The thing is, I'm still a minor,

529
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:31,462
so I need a parent to sign

530
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:33,607
Here and here

531
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:38,788
C'mon, sign

532
00:47:43,314 --> 00:47:44,948
If you won't, forget it

533
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:50,162
There are organizations that'll
sponsor me instead of parents

534
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:53,951
Don't ask some strange organization
to sign for you

535
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,858
Then, sign

536
00:48:31,696 --> 00:48:33,189
Kurosu?

537
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:16,313
Kurosu san passed away With his wife

538
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,396
The other afternoon From gas poisoning

539
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,284
Really?

540
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:27,341
A double suicide,
but one forced the other

541
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:28,376
Welcome home

542
00:50:28,376 --> 00:50:29,963
I'm home

543
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:57,673
Honey, listen to him
and try not to get mad

544
00:50:58,301 --> 00:50:59,758
What is it?

545
00:51:00,872 --> 00:51:03,088
I want you to sign these papers

546
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,705
I absolutely forbid it

547
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:41,956
Why?

548
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:45,536
I raised you so you could lead
a happy life

549
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,968
This couldn't be farther from that goal

550
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:50,576
But in the military,
you can work for peace

551
00:51:50,576 --> 00:51:52,521
That's just rationalizing

552
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:56,206
But it's true
Why should I alone be happy?

553
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:58,327
It's better to
make the whole world happy

554
00:51:58,327 --> 00:51:59,994
The whole world?

555
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:01,455
What's that?

556
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,192
Who cares about that?

557
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:07,043
I'm not worried about the world,
I'm worried about you

558
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:10,141
Huh

559
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,341
That's why Japan's so hopeless

560
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:14,975
What?

561
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,894
It's the American military
that protects Japan

562
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:19,944
So what?

563
00:52:21,196 --> 00:52:24,429
Think about it, at least a little

564
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:28,321
The reason I want to join
the American military

565
00:52:28,321 --> 00:52:30,545
is to protect you and Mom and Kenji

566
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:32,354
That's how it works

567
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:34,508
Don't be a smartass

568
00:52:34,508 --> 00:52:37,289
In this house, I protect you
That's how it works

569
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:39,826
You can't just do whatever you want

570
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:43,262
You're the one that needs to
think about it

571
00:52:43,996 --> 00:52:46,283
I don't want your protection

572
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,156
Get out, then

573
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:53,786
Get out!

574
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:55,979
Get out!

575
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:08,284
Forget it

576
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:11,306
I'll ask someone else

577
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:13,672
Takashi, wait!

578
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:20,735
Can't you figure out a better way
to talk to him!

579
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:22,855
Takashi, it's fine
if you want to leave us

580
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:26,365
But not for America

581
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:30,288
Stay in Japan and do what you can here,
OK?

582
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:34,840
What am I supposed to do?

583
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:43,003
You say you're protecting us, Dad

584
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:46,479
But what do you do, every day?

585
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:53,918
You can't even answer me

586
00:54:00,496 --> 00:54:02,570
I have to get ready

587
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:46,955
Can you listen to me?

588
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:48,163
Yes

589
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:55,704
You're talented

590
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,912
Extraordinarily so

591
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:03,673
Are there any musicians
in your family or relatives?

592
00:55:03,673 --> 00:55:05,029
No

593
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:08,539
I see You were just born with it

594
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,215
Once in a while,
there are children like you

595
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:12,910
Is that so?

596
00:55:14,726 --> 00:55:19,488
I think you should go to a
Jr. High specializing in music

597
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:22,338
Of course you'll have to take an exam

598
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:26,647
But this is an important discussion
I need to have with your parents

599
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:27,830
Impossible

600
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,741
Why?

601
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:32,312
My father is against my learning piano

602
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,719
I didn't realize...

603
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:38,291
And there's stuff going on at home

604
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:43,122
I don't know what'll happen
if I start talking about piano...

605
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:45,486
I can explain it to them

606
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:47,710
I'll tell them myself

607
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,661
Please wait a little longer

608
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:15,967
It's a cleaning job at a shopping mall
Is that OK?

609
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,219
Yes

610
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:19,339
Any preference for working hours?

611
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:22,051
It's up to you

612
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:25,039
I see When can you start?

613
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:26,496
Anytime

614
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:22,968
This is for plastics,

615
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:25,818
this is for wood, this is for veneer

616
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:29,711
But use this one for painted veneer

617
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:33,669
And this is multi-purpose Use it
for anything, got that?

618
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:38,643
Can't I just clean everything
with that one?

619
00:57:38,643 --> 00:57:40,136
No

620
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:42,362
Why not...

621
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:44,413
It's not professional

622
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:45,870
I see

623
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:49,905
Why do we carry it around?

624
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:51,812
It's for just in case

625
00:57:57,864 --> 00:58:00,708
Excuse me, we need to clean the restroom

626
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:25,495
Stay in touch, OK?

627
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:27,372
Yeah

628
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:29,493
And swear to me
you won't get into trouble

629
00:58:29,493 --> 00:58:30,779
I won't

630
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:32,864
You swear?

631
00:58:32,864 --> 00:58:34,072
Yeah

632
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,801
Listen

633
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:47,278
Why don't you divorce him, Mom?

634
00:58:48,331 --> 00:58:51,841
Just get a divorce
You're still totally fine

635
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:54,379
What are you talking about?

636
00:58:54,379 --> 00:58:57,507
That's the one thing that worries me

637
00:58:57,507 --> 00:59:00,253
Who else will play mother in that family?

638
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:02,646
What difference does it make?

639
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:05,988
It's more complicated than that

640
00:59:05,988 --> 00:59:08,038
You sure?

641
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:12,550
Playing mother isn't all bad, you know

642
00:59:18,118 --> 00:59:20,547
I just don't get it

643
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:32,878
I'm off

644
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:47,929
National Border

645
01:02:29,907 --> 01:02:33,521
There's no question that
he owes 3 months' worth of lunch money

646
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:38,665
I see I give it to him every month

647
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:41,168
Also,

648
01:02:41,168 --> 01:02:45,055
he's excused himself early...

649
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:49,195
Countless times

650
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,229
Do you know of a reason?

651
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:54,966
I don't

652
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:56,982
Is he bullied?

653
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,833
If anything, he does the bullying

654
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,598
Which student?

655
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:04,142
Me

656
01:03:04,142 --> 01:03:05,351
What?

657
01:03:06,644 --> 01:03:11,093
I'm an adult so it hardly bothers me,

658
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:14,291
but your son is definitely
out of place here

659
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,678
I see

660
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:20,200
It's something
your family should discuss

661
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,302
Yes

662
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:37,439
Hey!

663
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,134
You can't just barge in!

664
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,842
What is that?

665
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:45,746
It's nothing!

666
01:03:45,746 --> 01:03:47,239
Get out!

667
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,883
What did you do with your lunch money?

668
01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:51,897
You haven't paid in 3 months

669
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,069
I was embarrassed
when your teacher told me

670
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:58,780
What did you spend that 1 5,000 Yen on?

671
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,718
This?

672
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:02,951
No, I found this on the street

673
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:05,060
Then what did you spend it on?

674
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:07,813
And tell me the truth

675
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:13,647
On piano lessons

676
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:18,866
I'll get a job and pay back
the 1 5,000 Yen, OK?

677
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:24,812
You're kidding Piano lessons?

678
01:04:25,439 --> 01:04:30,061
You should have told me
I would've paid for them

679
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:34,614
But you said, "No piano"

680
01:04:34,614 --> 01:04:36,166
Yes, I did

681
01:04:37,326 --> 01:04:41,177
But pocketing your lunch money is worse

682
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:48,165
Go ahead, learn piano

683
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:52,542
I think men who play
the piano are attractive

684
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:55,952
Don't tell Dad

685
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:59,809
You know he'll never let me

686
01:05:03,915 --> 01:05:05,503
OK

687
01:05:38,845 --> 01:05:43,491
Kaneko Piano School

688
01:05:45,414 --> 01:05:47,395
Welcome home

689
01:05:47,395 --> 01:05:50,732
It seems Kenji's been sneaking off
to piano lessons

690
01:05:50,732 --> 01:05:52,157
I see

691
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:54,694
He's been lying to us this whole time

692
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:56,389
He's a mess

693
01:05:56,988 --> 01:05:58,205
Kenji, get down here

694
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,561
I need to talk to you!

695
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:02,167
Honey, please don't get too mad at him

696
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:06,267
I won't. But he needs to hear
some straight talk

697
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:19,997
We got a letter from
the Kaneko Music School

698
01:06:19,997 --> 01:06:23,369
It says you should apply to
the Jr. High at a Music School

699
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:25,620
What's going on? Tell me

700
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:40,531
Tell me!

701
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:43,667
I just studied a little piano

702
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:44,918
Behind our backs?

703
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,282
Who cares what I do?

704
01:06:47,282 --> 01:06:49,263
I told you "No piano"

705
01:06:49,263 --> 01:06:51,170
That makes no sense

706
01:06:52,113 --> 01:06:55,867
If you think I don't make sense,
come out and say so

707
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:59,760
Don't go behind our backs,
hoping you won't get caught

708
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,955
I hate that kind of cowardly attitude
more than anything

709
01:07:19,397 --> 01:07:21,795
Honey, this...

710
01:07:21,795 --> 01:07:24,715
The letter from Kaneko

711
01:07:24,715 --> 01:07:28,712
It says Kenji's a genius piano player

712
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,035
That he's a rare child prodigy

713
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:39,765
How can you possibly believe that?

714
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:42,893
How could our child be a prodigy?

715
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:46,230
Who the hell is this Kaneko, anyway?

716
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,628
This guy's a real bullshit artist

717
01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:50,713
My teacher, Kaneko, isn't like that!

718
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:51,373
Besides...

719
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:52,556
What?

720
01:07:52,556 --> 01:07:54,535
She's a she, not a guy

721
01:07:55,996 --> 01:07:58,464
You're a real idiot

722
01:07:58,464 --> 01:08:01,036
These music schools praise everyone

723
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,943
That's how they make a living

724
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:05,555
I'll quit playing piano!

725
01:08:05,555 --> 01:08:07,083
So just leave me alone!

726
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:19,167
This is all
your fault for not telling us

727
01:08:20,952 --> 01:08:23,238
You're lying

728
01:08:24,115 --> 01:08:25,435
What was that?

729
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:28,216
You're lying when you say
you'll listen if I talk

730
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:32,109
No matter how much I talk to you,
you won't change your mind!

731
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,812
Just like Ero-Bayashi

732
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:36,479
All you really want is to lecture me
and act tough!

733
01:08:39,164 --> 01:08:40,752
Honey, stop it!

734
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:43,016
Are you OK?

735
01:08:44,343 --> 01:08:46,073
You go on upstairs

736
01:08:50,912 --> 01:08:52,233
Don't hit him

737
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:53,300
Sure

738
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,714
Why can't he play piano?

739
01:08:58,455 --> 01:09:01,096
Once I've said "No" I can't take it back

740
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:03,286
It affects my authority as a parent

741
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:06,622
I was too lenient with Takashi

742
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:09,020
So I'm shoving our parental values down
Kenji's throat, if I have to

743
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,002
You have to help me

744
01:09:11,002 --> 01:09:14,189
He needs a clear message from both of us

745
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,357
What's that look?

746
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:30,639
I saw you the other day

747
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:35,711
You were standing in the free food line
at the park

748
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:39,950
You're unemployed, right?

749
01:09:42,283 --> 01:09:43,604
You knew?

750
01:09:43,604 --> 01:09:45,237
Yes, all along

751
01:09:45,237 --> 01:09:47,532
Why didn't you tell me?

752
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:51,727
Because if I do,
your authority is screwed

753
01:09:58,514 --> 01:10:01,358
Screw your authority

754
01:10:09,393 --> 01:10:10,566
What?

755
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,002
Kenji!

756
01:10:34,002 --> 01:10:35,601
Kenji!

757
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:37,472
Honey, call an ambulance!

758
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:40,570
I was just trying to catch him...

759
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,821
Shut up and call!

760
01:10:49,781 --> 01:10:51,926
This is the 11 O'clock News

761
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:55,551
The U.S. has announced
it is expanding its war

762
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:59,861
in the Middle East and is planning
a military troop surge

763
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:03,650
According to the Dept. of Defense,

764
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:07,264
this deployment will include soldiers
of any nationality

765
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:12,200
This means it is likely
that the 1 38 soldiers

766
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,884
recently recruited from Japan
will also be deployed

767
01:11:15,884 --> 01:11:20,123
A growing number of Japanese youths are
volunteering for the U.S. military

768
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:24,294
We interviewed youths
in order to find out

769
01:11:24,294 --> 01:11:26,832
what they think about this

770
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:28,639
I support it

771
01:11:28,639 --> 01:11:32,740
We have a lot of trade with America,

772
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,556
so if American has a problem,

773
01:11:35,556 --> 01:11:40,527
that means Japan's directly affected

774
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:44,350
So I think
it's a good thing to cooperate

775
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:48,833
with America to try to
help solve their problems

776
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:50,848
I think like...

777
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:57,105
Like it's really great
if they're serious about it

778
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,807
I support the troops...

779
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:06,733
The Japanese Constitution explicitly

780
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:09,583
prohibits our country from going to war

781
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:14,206
So I couldn't believe it...

782
01:12:14,206 --> 01:12:18,508
That our government let them join up

783
01:12:23,242 --> 01:12:24,667
Kenji!

784
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:25,676
How is he?

785
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:27,657
I detected no brain abnormalities

786
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:30,785
He does have a concussion
but he's fine otherwise

787
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:31,862
Thank goodness

788
01:12:31,862 --> 01:12:32,592
Take care

789
01:12:32,592 --> 01:12:35,187
Thank you

790
01:12:54,906 --> 01:12:56,956
I told you not to do that!

791
01:13:00,745 --> 01:13:02,238
Come

792
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:21,356
Takashi!

793
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,458
I'm home

794
01:13:27,578 --> 01:13:29,106
I'm exhausted

795
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:32,721
You should have told us
you were coming home

796
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:36,395
We saw it on the news
and were so worried about you

797
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,380
But I'm glad you're home

798
01:13:52,046 --> 01:13:53,989
I killed so many people

799
01:13:59,554 --> 01:14:01,734
I killed too many

800
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:27,734
Takashi...

801
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,336
Excuse me, I need the number
for the Foreign Ministry

802
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:06,705
My son volunteered for the U.S. military

803
01:15:06,705 --> 01:15:09,971
I wanted to find out
if there's any way to determine

804
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:11,808
his safety

805
01:15:12,647 --> 01:15:13,856
Yes

806
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,972
Whether he's safe...

807
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:25,229
Oh, I see

808
01:15:27,245 --> 01:15:29,781
So it's impossible...

809
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,750
No!

810
01:17:11,934 --> 01:17:12,941
It's not

811
01:17:14,366 --> 01:17:15,681
Like that

812
01:17:22,326 --> 01:17:27,291
3 Hours Earlier

813
01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:55,646
You scream, I'll kill you!

814
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,735
The cash! Where is it!

815
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:19,563
You don't have any?

816
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:21,826
Liar!

817
01:18:27,009 --> 01:18:30,789
There's no cash here

818
01:18:36,115 --> 01:18:38,509
Why!

819
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:14,517
That was close

820
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,344
She saw my face!

821
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:23,834
Fuck, she saw my face!

822
01:19:25,018 --> 01:19:27,033
What should I do?

823
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:33,940
Get up!

824
01:19:35,514 --> 01:19:37,427
What are you doing?

825
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:39,820
You're my hostage Come with me

826
01:19:43,856 --> 01:19:47,186
May I take my jacket and purse?

827
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:07,526
Can you drive?

828
01:20:07,526 --> 01:20:08,534
Yes

829
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:11,448
OK, do it!

830
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:15,444
Oh, right

831
01:20:26,503 --> 01:20:27,859
What are you doing!

832
01:20:27,859 --> 01:20:29,173
Put it back!

833
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,290
What kind of car is this?

834
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,646
I don't know

835
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:47,183
I just stole it

836
01:20:47,183 --> 01:20:48,640
Drive!

837
01:21:06,856 --> 01:21:08,697
Who's that!

838
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,957
My neighbor, Okada san

839
01:21:10,957 --> 01:21:12,730
Not a cop?

840
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,973
No

841
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,839
Just go straight

842
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:18,810
Yes

843
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:21,628
The next left

844
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:22,563
Yes

845
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:26,215
You forgot to signal

846
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,502
Oh, sorry

847
01:21:27,502 --> 01:21:28,405
Not those!

848
01:21:28,405 --> 01:21:29,657
Oh, sorry

849
01:21:29,657 --> 01:21:30,700
Watch the road!

850
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,979
Yes

851
01:21:55,029 --> 01:21:56,652
Um...

852
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:58,740
What?

853
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,462
Can you put that thing down?

854
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:17,376
Do you do this sort of thing a lot?

855
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,047
A lot?

856
01:22:21,827 --> 01:22:23,319
Are you nuts?

857
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:25,751
Why, then?

858
01:22:29,473 --> 01:22:32,211
I was good at picking locks

859
01:22:32,844 --> 01:22:34,716
I could pick any lock in a flash

860
01:22:36,841 --> 01:22:39,270
So I decided to go professional

861
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:41,951
A professional thief?

862
01:22:41,951 --> 01:22:43,538
Of course not

863
01:22:45,739 --> 01:22:47,291
A locksmith

864
01:22:53,004 --> 01:22:55,078
But I quickly failed

865
01:22:56,548 --> 01:22:58,693
I'm not a good businessman

866
01:23:00,789 --> 01:23:03,847
No matter how many times,
I always failed

867
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:06,170
I just can't get along with people

868
01:23:08,018 --> 01:23:09,784
And now finally...

869
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:20,241
I even failed at robbery

870
01:23:25,953 --> 01:23:27,611
I understand

871
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:33,345
The hell you do!

872
01:23:34,226 --> 01:23:37,105
I can always crash this damned car!

873
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,389
Um, can I use the bathroom?

874
01:23:47,955 --> 01:23:48,985
Running away?

875
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,006
No!

876
01:24:02,587 --> 01:24:04,353
Welcome

877
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:56,043
Why did you come back?

878
01:24:56,043 --> 01:24:57,986
That was the deal, right?

879
01:24:59,484 --> 01:25:02,160
What are you thinking?

880
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,439
Nothing

881
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,423
OK

882
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,896
I'll drop you off at some station

883
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:43,518
I'll go on alone

884
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:46,926
You go home

885
01:26:01,804 --> 01:26:03,261
I can't go home

886
01:26:06,565 --> 01:26:08,615
I've come this far,

887
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:12,087
I can't go home now

888
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:36,001
Hey, Sasaki

889
01:26:36,421 --> 01:26:39,410
Taguchi, what's up?

890
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,418
Running away

891
01:26:40,418 --> 01:26:41,495
For real?

892
01:26:41,495 --> 01:26:43,268
I'm so sick of it all

893
01:26:43,268 --> 01:26:46,848
School, cram school, family hour

894
01:26:46,848 --> 01:26:48,543
Give me a break

895
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:53,517
Hey, thank you

896
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:56,441
How about your piano lessons?

897
01:26:56,441 --> 01:26:57,970
I quit

898
01:26:57,970 --> 01:26:59,108
Yeah?

899
01:27:00,056 --> 01:27:02,556
Grownups just please themselves

900
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:08,780
It's Dad, shit

901
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:10,059
He's chasing me

902
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:26,460
Hey, what's wrong?

903
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:29,246
It's an asthma attack

904
01:27:30,156 --> 01:27:31,329
Are you OK?

905
01:27:37,871 --> 01:27:40,371
Are you OK!

906
01:28:28,373 --> 01:28:29,242
I'll go buy juice

907
01:28:29,242 --> 01:28:30,597
Don't go

908
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,019
You'll be fine

909
01:28:33,761 --> 01:28:36,913
If they find me, Dad'll beat me up

910
01:28:38,348 --> 01:28:39,971
I'll be right back

911
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,128
A dead end

912
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:36,486
I don't care what happens anymore

913
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:41,212
How about you?

914
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:01,900
I'll go see what's up ahead

915
01:30:29,188 --> 01:30:33,834
Do you think I can start over?

916
01:30:36,627 --> 01:30:39,541
From this moment on,

917
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:42,464
do you think I can start over?

918
01:30:52,684 --> 01:30:55,314
Is that land over there?

919
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,751
Or a boat?

920
01:31:09,993 --> 01:31:11,237
I can't see

921
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:17,187
I can't see a thing!

922
01:32:07,342 --> 01:32:08,628
How wonderful it would be,

923
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:12,242
if my whole life so far, turns out
to have been a dream

924
01:32:12,242 --> 01:32:21,759
And suddenly I awaken and
I'm someone else entirely

925
01:33:24,189 --> 01:33:25,741
How can l...

926
01:33:27,943 --> 01:33:29,566
How can l...

927
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:33,604
Start over...

928
01:33:34,582 --> 01:33:36,489
How can l...

929
01:33:41,881 --> 01:33:43,717
I want to start over

930
01:33:48,519 --> 01:33:50,984
To start over

931
01:34:56,782 --> 01:34:58,405
What am I doing...

932
01:35:01,057 --> 01:35:03,486
I'm nothing more than a string of failures

933
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:08,626
I'm just a total failure

934
01:35:11,762 --> 01:35:15,128
Don't hurt yourself, please

935
01:35:31,122 --> 01:35:35,460
You're the only person who can be you

936
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:41,304
That's all we have to hold onto

937
01:35:43,704 --> 01:35:45,161
Are you...

938
01:35:47,944 --> 01:35:49,496
Actually...

939
01:35:50,482 --> 01:35:52,105
God?

940
01:36:30,557 --> 01:36:32,500
Hey, wake up

941
01:36:34,796 --> 01:36:37,119
What do you think that is over there?

942
01:36:37,473 --> 01:36:41,360
It looks like a star,
but it's so low in the sky

943
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:46,435
Hey, wake up

944
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,635
Wake up, wake up!

945
01:38:31,093 --> 01:38:32,372
Hey!

946
01:38:36,967 --> 01:38:38,034
Gotcha!

947
01:38:48,645 --> 01:38:50,766
He was sneaking into
the baggage compartment

948
01:38:50,766 --> 01:38:52,425
A fare cheater?

949
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:55,250
Hey, is that true?

950
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:57,335
He won't say a word

951
01:38:57,335 --> 01:39:00,037
I understand I'll take him in

952
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:06,615
Name, address, phone number, school name

953
01:39:06,615 --> 01:39:08,310
I don't care which, tell me

954
01:39:13,984 --> 01:39:16,058
You can't go home if you don't talk

955
01:39:26,218 --> 01:39:27,533
You won't talk?

956
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:33,447
You leave me no choice but to book
you as an adult fare cheater

957
01:39:33,447 --> 01:39:34,798
OK with that?

958
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,709
This way, straight

959
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:23,383
That way

960
01:40:24,262 --> 01:40:25,577
Don't move

961
01:41:40,171 --> 01:41:42,944
Hey, get up

962
01:41:46,219 --> 01:41:48,850
They dropped your case. You're free to go

963
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:27,883
I'm home

964
01:46:00,431 --> 01:46:02,169
Where's your father?

965
01:46:02,169 --> 01:46:03,697
Not home

966
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:06,548
Aren't you hungry?

967
01:46:06,548 --> 01:46:07,519
Yeah

968
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:10,821
I'll cook something

969
01:46:42,001 --> 01:46:43,493
What?

970
01:47:26,107 --> 01:47:30,171
Lost and Found Box

971
01:48:24,881 --> 01:48:27,381
You look strange, Dad

972
01:48:53,556 --> 01:48:55,223
This is the 9 O'clock News

973
01:48:55,223 --> 01:48:57,831
Since last month,
the U.S. military has been

974
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:00,541
expanding its war zone
in the Middle East

975
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:03,322
But the Department of Defense
is expected to

976
01:49:03,322 --> 01:49:07,354
announce yet another development
later today

977
01:49:07,354 --> 01:49:10,691
According to sources,
they are expected to announce

978
01:49:10,691 --> 01:49:13,888
a pullback in U.S. troop strength
in the Middle East,

979
01:49:13,888 --> 01:49:17,190
with the result that the 3,000

980
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:21,673
international volunteers,
including the 1 38 Japanese soldiers,

981
01:49:21,673 --> 01:49:23,296
will be returning to
their native countries

982
01:49:38,427 --> 01:49:43,143
4 Months Later

983
01:50:15,478 --> 01:50:17,065
It's been a while

984
01:50:18,432 --> 01:50:20,268
I hope you are all well

985
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:23,541
Recently,

986
01:50:23,541 --> 01:50:27,048
I've learned that America isn't
the only one that's right

987
01:50:28,338 --> 01:50:31,431
That is why I've decided to stay

988
01:50:31,431 --> 01:50:35,428
in this country a while longer,
so I can understand them better

989
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:39,808
I've come to the conclusion
that the best path for me,

990
01:50:39,808 --> 01:50:42,796
is to fight alongside the people

991
01:50:42,796 --> 01:50:46,541
of this country,
in order to find true happiness

992
01:50:47,211 --> 01:50:49,083
Please don't worry about me

993
01:50:50,373 --> 01:50:52,353
I'm doing fine

994
01:50:53,223 --> 01:50:54,811
I'll write again

995
01:50:55,865 --> 01:51:03,580
Shiroyama Music School Prep Audition

996
01:51:37,886 --> 01:51:39,589
He's so good

997
01:51:39,589 --> 01:51:40,940
I know

998
01:52:18,865 --> 01:52:20,144
He's next

999
01:52:22,618 --> 01:52:24,905
I hope Kenji will be OK
