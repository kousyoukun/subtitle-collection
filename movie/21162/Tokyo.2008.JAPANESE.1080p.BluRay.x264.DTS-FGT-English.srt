1
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,820
It rained for months on end.

2
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,540
The whole of Tokyo was flooded.

3
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,740
The damage ran to billions of yen,

4
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,450
and the dead and missing
numbered in the millions.

5
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,160
The survivors

6
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,450
all mutated
into strange amphibian monsters,

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,490
adapting quickly
to the suddenly changing climate.

8
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,570
We're all going to die!

9
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,330
No, we'll mutate.

10
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,820
We mustn't breed!

11
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,360
Think what the children
would look like.

12
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,450
No, actually,

13
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,330
the horniness
is part of the mutation.

14
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,200
That's why the species
is so successful,

15
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,820
from an evolutionary point of view.

16
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,660
- Hello?
- Hiroko?

17
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,280
- Are you lost?
- No, we're not lost,

18
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,940
just stuck in traffic.

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,990
- Where are you now?
- Right now...

20
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,700
We've just passed shinsencho.

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,030
You will get here soon.

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,870
Okay, talk to you in a bit.

23
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,620
Yeah, see you.

24
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,080
Are we going the right way?

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,740
Look at the map.

26
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,490
Excuse me. Excuse me.

27
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,150
We're already... there, I think.

28
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,690
Really?

29
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,990
Where? What color is your car?

30
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,620
Well...

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,620
It's silver.

32
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,370
A Honda.

33
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,980
Well, more like gray, really.

34
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,120
I've got a red umbrella.

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,030
A red umbrella?

36
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,910
Spin it round.

37
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,410
I'll try.

38
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,370
I'm spinning it, I'm spinning it.
Can't you see me?

39
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,530
Now jump.

40
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,320
Jump?

41
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,080
Okay, here I go...

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,160
Now on one leg.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,610
- Akemi!
- Hiroko!

44
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,110
Here, towels.

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,030
Thanks.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,860
In Tokyo,

47
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,650
the bigger the company you work for,

48
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,240
the smaller the flat you get.

49
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,080
You should work
for a smaller company.

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,990
My company's already pretty small.

51
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,290
- It's a nice place.
- You think so?

52
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,240
You still have saburo, then?

53
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,820
Little saburo!

54
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,110
It's raining tonight,
so your car should be okay.

55
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,820
But you can't leave it.

56
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,360
There's a hardware store,
just over there.

57
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,980
Park in front.
It's been closed for a while.

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,950
Akemi shimizu

59
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,700
now for this week's episode
of where are they now?

60
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,910
Akira, what are you doing now?

61
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,120
Well... I'm a filmmaker.

62
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,830
He's just made a film
that he's showing around.

63
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,110
The film's about...

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Is the main thing.
Please go and see it.

65
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,870
This is it.

66
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,870
But this is...

67
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,580
A porno theater.

68
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,950
It's a real theater, then!

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,580
It'll be dark and quiet.

70
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,620
You shouldn't have cut
my sex scene after all!

71
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,860
Are you making pornos?

72
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,230
No, that was a joke.

73
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,080
I had a part for hiroko,
but she turned it down.

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
What a pity. No ambition!

75
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,480
Right!
That's her problem exactly.

76
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,230
Why did you pass up the chance
to be a star?

77
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,150
I don't like the sound
of my own voice.

78
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,190
It sounds like this.

79
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,610
I can't wait to see it.

80
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,280
Really?

81
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,910
How about now?

82
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,950
- I've got the DVD here.
- She might be tired.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,030
No, let's watch it now.
It's not too intellectual, is it?

84
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,950
There are so many lives
in the future.

85
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,240
Assuming we haven't
destroyed ourselves first,

86
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,980
we could live on
after the end of the solar system.

87
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,580
In the infinity
of new souls created,

88
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,740
there's no reason that one
shouldn't be me again.

89
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,610
Sorry.

90
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,910
I have to get up early
in the morning.

91
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,940
Can you help me with this?

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,160
I liked the bit I saw, though.

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,490
You can change in the bathroom.

94
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,700
Hiroko, can you pull that side?

95
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,820
I hope you'll be all right.
I'm sorry it's so cramped.

96
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,950
It's fine.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,190
"A good soldier
must suffer with pride," right?

98
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,030
"Enduring the unendurable.
Suffering the..."

99
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,910
Stop it, stupid!

100
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,360
Seriously, though. Thanks.

101
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,950
We'll start looking for an apartment
tomorrow.

102
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,190
My boyfriend's staying next Sunday.
He's driving from nagoya.

103
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,030
His uncle works in advertising.

104
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,650
Shall I ask him
to come and see your film?

105
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,190
You think he'd come from nagoya?

106
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,240
Of course not! That's my side.

107
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,780
His uncle lives in Tokyo.

108
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,940
I'm switching it off.

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,830
All that way, for your movie!

110
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,030
Three, two, one...

111
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,990
Good night!

112
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,950
Don't forget
to move your car tomorrow.

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,490
The fines are huge.

114
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,990
I'm glad it's raining.

115
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,870
Don't forget to move your car

116
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,250
Look.

117
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,990
We'll be okay until Friday.

118
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,370
Closed until Friday
November 16th

119
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,160
what are you doing?
It'll go up if we don't pay.

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,780
We're not kids anymore.

121
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,540
Cover me!
I'm going into the safe!

122
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,540
Copy that!

123
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,030
We can't make any more mistakes.
Our budget's tight as it is.

124
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,700
To rent an apartment...

125
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,910
Say the rent is 30,000...

126
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,410
We'd need a deposit

127
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,160
of two months' rent.

128
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,410
In all, we'd need...

129
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,610
We would need
400,000 yen in advance.

130
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,700
It's a good place for young couples.

131
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,280
Who are you? Let me out!

132
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,990
It's popular with young couples.

133
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,780
Do you like the view?

134
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,290
Nice dead cat.

135
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,990
Something smells like shit!

136
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,820
I can't live in a dump like that.

137
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,490
There wasn't any soap left
in akemi's place.

138
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,400
Do you think it's a hotel?

139
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,740
I didn't mean that.

140
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,320
My bad.
Let's go and buy some soap now.

141
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,290
What's wrong? Are you mad?

142
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,490
It's nothing.

143
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,030
Come on, what is it?

144
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,650
You said I have no ambition.

145
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,450
What?

146
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,070
Yesterday. You said
I have no ambition at all.

147
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,320
I said that?

148
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,240
It's not true.
I like photography and art,

149
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,030
I've got a boating license,

150
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,490
and I read a lot too.

151
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,660
But they're hobbies.
They're not the same as ambitions.

152
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,410
What's the difference?

153
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,490
You have to be able

154
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,280
to define who you are in the world
by what you do.

155
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:37,450
What I like to do
defines who I am.

156
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
Doesn't that make me
a richer person?

157
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,740
You still have to be better at it
than others.

158
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,240
Something's wrong.

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,490
Hey.

160
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,900
Something's wrong
with these buildings.

161
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,990
They refuse all physical contact
with each other.

162
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,830
You're always say
something clever

163
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,660
to avoid really talking.

164
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,910
Every night, flat ghosts

165
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,870
slide in and out of these gaps,

166
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,820
and wander about the city...

167
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,490
They wander about the city,

168
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,610
scaring the people shitless.

169
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,900
The authorities
fill in the gaps with concrete,

170
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,820
but the buildings keep moving apart,

171
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,740
letting the flat creatures
take over.

172
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,490
I could make them out of paper.

173
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,900
All right, what's the matter?

174
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm listening.

175
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,450
I'm ready
for a dramatic conversation,

176
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,610
with flashbacks and a big climax...

177
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,950
You've stopped listening already.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,780
You're the one who's "dramatic'!

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm listening.

180
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,490
But we're talking a lot.

181
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,080
That's not true!

182
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,120
Maybe you're right.

183
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,530
I don't think I know
what I'm doing.

184
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,900
What, here?

185
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,990
No, in general.

186
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,320
You take things too seriously.

187
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,950
Where's your sense of humor?

188
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,780
There are
these two poisonous snakes.

189
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,650
One says to the other,

190
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,070
"we're poisonous, aren't we?"

191
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,990
So the other one says,

192
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,030
"of course we are.
Why do you ask?"

193
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,280
And the first shake says,

194
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,150
"I've just bitten my tongue!"

195
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,240
Part-time job available
wrapping purchases

196
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,240
a part-time job.

197
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,150
We could work here.

198
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,540
No, they'll pay peanuts!

199
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,870
It'd take two weeks
to pay off the parking fine!

200
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,200
Wait till you find a real job.

201
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,700
I want to keep busy.

202
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,660
Anyway, I have no ambition,

203
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,490
so it's a perfect job for me.
Come on!

204
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,700
I did it without thinking
and got the job.

205
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,910
Only you, Akira?

206
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,950
But hiroko's dog was great.
They are stupid.

207
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,030
It wasn't great.
And it was a cat.

208
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,910
You're better off
doing something else.

209
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,740
I won't work there long.

210
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,990
How long do you plan to stay here?

211
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,860
We haven't really...

212
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,110
We saw a nice place today.

213
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,030
We have a good chance of getting it.

214
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,740
Yes, a really good chance!

215
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,450
Where?

216
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,910
Tokyo...

217
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,780
No boyfriends, no pets.

218
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,320
Is there anyone who actually checks?

219
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,990
Don't wrap two together.

220
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
Hello.

221
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,910
There seem to be some residents

222
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,910
already living here!

223
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,690
Friday November 16th

224
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,910
closed until Friday
November 16th

225
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,200
Car no 55m46-51 towed away
to municipal pound

226
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,410
so I wrap nine boxes
with just one roll of paper.

227
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,120
But she says I should do eleven.

228
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,450
How am I supposed to do that?
Even ten is impossible.

229
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,610
What's the matter?

230
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,570
The car was stolen today.

231
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,200
All our equipment was in it.

232
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,740
What about the screening?

233
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,070
- I'm screwed!
- No, you're not.

234
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
Yesterday,

235
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,740
I moved everything
into the apartment.

236
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,240
I didn't like leaving it out there.

237
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,610
Akemi was upset
so I forgot to tell you.

238
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,900
Great thinking!

239
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,450
The smoke machine too?

240
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,150
I just told you.
There's the 15,000-yen fine,

241
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,120
plus a 14,000-yen towing fee.

242
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,360
I don't have 29,000 yen.

243
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,740
But I need my things
from the car.

244
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,370
Can you take me to it,

245
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,400
not until you pay the money.

246
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,490
We're open until 6:00.

247
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,530
It's still my car!

248
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,950
Not until you pay the money,
it's not.

249
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,940
Let's just say
there's 29,000 yen in the car.

250
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,330
I can get the money and pay you.

251
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,280
What do you say?

252
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,820
What'll happen to it
if I don't pay?

253
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,160
A silver one...

254
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,490
Make? Color?

255
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,280
Year?

256
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,160
Thank you.

257
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,900
I hate him. He's a cavity!

258
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,570
He's got bad teeth?

259
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,580
No, I mean he's a cavity himself.

260
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,860
Last year he caught pneumonia.

261
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,280
Too bad, he has a good doctor!

262
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,370
All that stuff?

263
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,950
Here you go!

264
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Put it in here, please.

265
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,700
Where shall I put this?

266
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,150
Look!

267
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,830
There are so many lives
in the future.

268
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,110
Assuming we haven't

269
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,150
destroyed ourselves first,

270
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,400
we could live on.

271
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,780
If we moved our vessel or planet

272
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,240
close to the black hole,

273
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,580
at the edge of the event horizon,

274
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,700
then tossed in
all our nuclear waste...

275
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,910
Great! I've never seen smoke
used like that

276
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,990
in a film before.

277
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,740
No, Lucy.

278
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,950
It's the first time smoke's been
used that way outside a film.

279
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,660
Using smoke inside films
is so common.

280
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,030
I want to force
the audience's involvement

281
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,690
by breaking through
the surface of the screen.

282
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,160
The audience shouldn't feel safe.

283
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,990
Pleased to meet you.

284
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,780
It got to me, eh?

285
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,450
You should come
to my office sometime.

286
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,200
We usually do

287
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,280
advertising for medical products.

288
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,160
But we get more creative sometimes.

289
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,410
Thanks.

290
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,950
I'll think about it. I'm considering
a few options right now.

291
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,740
Nice work! Pretty funny.

292
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,030
Really?

293
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,790
Being funny is the hardest.

294
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,990
I'm going for a beer.

295
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,030
Excuse me.

296
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,450
- I'll pass this on.
- Thank you.

297
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,150
You should be in films.

298
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,660
Come off it! Not me.

299
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,910
Were you in the film?

300
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,070
That's not me.

301
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm more in transportation.
I helped with the editing too.

302
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,200
Are you a filmmaker, too?

303
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,280
No, I'm just the girlfriend.

304
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,360
You must be a good one.

305
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,490
Relationships with artists
are tough.

306
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,530
They can be demanding.

307
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,580
I once went out with a painter.
He was always working

308
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,190
or talking about his work.
I felt invisible.

309
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,690
But when he had an opening,
with all those people,

310
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,910
I realized his art
was more important than my problems.

311
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,150
You said they'd be out tonight.

312
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,790
Not so loud.

313
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,320
I told them you were coming.
I thought they'd understand.

314
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,990
Apparently not!

315
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,620
One extra person
is bad enough, but two...

316
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,400
Don't say that.

317
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,950
They're my friends.
I have to help them.

318
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,440
They're just
taking advantage of you.

319
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,530
You're not helping them.
All you're doing is indulging them.

320
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,620
Your "friend" doesn't think he has
to work because he's an "artist."

321
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,030
My uncle won't hire him.
He thinks he's an idiot.

322
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,950
Akira's not an idiot.

323
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,160
He's even got a job.
Hiroko is the problem.

324
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,910
She just hangs around all day,

325
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,070
cutting pictures
out of my magazines.

326
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,570
"Dear Akira,

327
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,950
I hope

328
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,780
that this letter finds you well,

329
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,240
and that

330
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,450
your screenings are going well.

331
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,610
What about the wrapping?

332
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,500
Are you still doing that job?

333
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,200
Or maybe by now

334
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,070
you're a big-shot director.

335
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,700
Or perhaps

336
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,940
you're in advertising.

337
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,490
I wonder what happened to the car.

338
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,900
I hope that someone

339
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,150
is having a good time with it.

340
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,990
I wonder how akemi's doing."

341
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:43,070
"I tried to fold this letter
into an elegant yacht,

342
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,110
but I got it totally wrong.

343
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,450
You know how useless I am
at origami.

344
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,990
As for me,

345
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,160
I'm living between the buildings
with the ghosts.

346
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,200
Just kidding."

347
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,650
"My life isn't that extraordinary."

348
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,530
"I'm fine.

349
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,440
That's all I wanted
to tell you, really.

350
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,370
And I'm doing

351
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,870
all the things

352
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,780
I ever wanted to do.

353
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,990
In fact,

354
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,080
I've never in all my life...

355
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,360
Felt so useful."

356
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,530
Huh?

357
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,820
What?

358
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,150
That's him! That's him!

359
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,190
Over there!

360
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,110
What the...!

361
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,280
The creature from the sewers!

362
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,740
This photo is three days
after you were born.

363
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,280
Wait!

364
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,700
Get him! Get him!

365
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,950
Here he comes!

366
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,660
Let's run now. Now!

367
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,740
Call the police now!

368
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,360
Call the police! Right now!

369
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,360
Get him. Get him!

370
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,580
Get him! Get him!

371
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,780
Tokyo is afraid.

372
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,070
Who is this creature

373
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,080
who for the past two weeks

374
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,530
has been terrifying citizens
all over Tokyo

375
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,280
and then vanishes?

376
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,820
The media are calling him
"the creature from the sewers."

377
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,070
A few shocked eyewitnesses

378
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,110
have managed to film him
on their cell phones.

379
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,360
Just watch, Mr. nomoto...

380
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,030
His gait,

381
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,450
his insane beard,

382
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,200
his milky eye...

383
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,160
I wanted to run away too

384
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,070
but I was so scared
I couldn't move.

385
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,030
He came towards me...

386
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,860
And then he...

387
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,030
He licked me.

388
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,950
He was disgusting...

389
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,700
Sorry.

390
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,530
His eye was like this,

391
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:37,570
and he walked like this...

392
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,280
I was so afraid...

393
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,780
He was walking like this...

394
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,820
And smoking like that...

395
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,820
The police are still searching
the sewers and underground.

396
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,110
To our heroes of nanking - 1937

397
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,070
The creature from the sewers!

398
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,870
Over there.

399
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,120
I found him.

400
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,700
Here he is.

401
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,660
Don't move!

402
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,410
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

403
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,530
And I plan to prove to the court,

404
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,070
without trying its Patience,

405
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,950
in less than...

406
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,660
Ninety minutes,

407
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,400
that is,
before the clock strikes six

408
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:24,900
in this courthouse of the Republic,

409
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,990
that it is quite unthinkable
for my client,

410
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,860
whose whole life has been dedicated
to the good and the beautiful...

411
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,660
That it is unthinkable,
as I was saying,

412
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,070
for Mrs. defrasnoux

413
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,280
to have murdered by decapitation

414
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,490
léopoldine,

415
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,580
the cat belonging to the plaintiff,
Mr. troucat.

416
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,950
Where does the creature of the sewers
come from?

417
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,740
Under interrogation
he hasn't said a word.

418
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,200
All he eats is flowers,

419
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,610
and only

420
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,280
ichimonji chrysanthemum,

421
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,990
symbol of the imperial family.

422
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,950
The American government claims
to have spotted him

423
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,940
in footage of an al-qaeda camp.

424
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,620
In Siberia, a woman claims
he is her son Igor,

425
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,280
an amnesiac genius pianist
who disappeared 17 years ago.

426
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:40,740
In Japan, a young woman
says she saw him

427
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,910
inside the aum sect
10 years ago.

428
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,700
In Finland, a surgeon claims

429
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,910
he spotted him
in a Hungarian pedophile film.

430
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,700
What a story, Mr. nomoto.

431
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,860
A French lawyer,

432
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,950
maitre voland, has contacted
the Japanese government.

433
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,320
He claims that, although
he doesn't know the creature,

434
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,910
he can communicate with him.

435
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,320
Here he comes, Mr. voland!
This way, please!

436
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,160
Sir.

437
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,360
Mr. hirokishi would like to know
what you said

438
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,740
that finally made him react.

439
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,490
I asked him if he realized
that it's likely he'll be hanged.

440
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,150
And what did he reply?

441
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,360
He said, "no, I don't want to."

442
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,990
Did you ask him his name?

443
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,950
He said, "call me merde."

444
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,410
Which sounds very like
the French word merde.

445
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,860
Merde?

446
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:36,660
Following the merde case,
the Japanese government has decided

447
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,280
to toughen immigration regulations.

448
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,200
Inside Japan, there have been attacks

449
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,410
on white foreigners
with red beards.

450
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:52,780
Mr. merde,
whose trial will start tomorrow,

451
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:56,030
will be defended
by the French lawyer Mr. voland,

452
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,370
one of the only
three people in the world

453
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,230
who can speak
the same language as Mr. merde.

454
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,070
Mr. voland has already declared

455
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,860
that he will plead insanity

456
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:14,490
and irresponsibility
at the time of the offense.

457
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,160
Oh, well...

458
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,900
Let us move on to the motive
for this heinous act,

459
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:31,240
if such a motive can exist.

460
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:34,150
Could you tell us

461
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:40,120
why you took the lives
of so many innocent people?

462
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,370
"I don't like innocent people.”

463
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,320
"I don't like people."

464
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:07,740
So what... you're going to kill us all?

465
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,320
Wouldn't it have been simpler,

466
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:15,660
since you like no one,
for you to kill yourself?

467
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,910
"But I love life, imbecile!"

468
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:31,950
What?

469
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,660
Silence! Silence!

470
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,280
Maitre, instruct your client

471
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,870
the court will not be insulted!

472
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,990
At least modern terrorists

473
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,950
have the decency

474
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,450
to blow themselves up with their victims.

475
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,690
"And among all people,

476
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,860
the Japanese are really
the most disgusting.”

477
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,070
Disgusting?

478
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,070
I understand now.

479
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,030
You should know that in Japan,

480
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,620
we don't really like racist foreigners.

481
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,660
Besides, nobody forced you to come

482
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,410
and live in our country!

483
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,990
"Yes. My god did."

484
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,740
"My god always places me

485
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,950
among the people
I hate the most.

486
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,580
It's the cross I have to bear."

487
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,740
So I ask you, Mr. merde,

488
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:21,360
what do you have against the Japanese?

489
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,240
"They live way too long.

490
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,650
And their eyes are shaped
like a woman's sex.

491
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,410
It's totally disgusting.”

492
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:01,610
Silence! Silence!

493
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:08,660
And Mr. merde thinks that he is...

494
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,740
Quite appealing?

495
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,610
"I don't know.

496
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,990
But if I knew, I'd answer yes."

497
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,570
"I've never looked at myself.

498
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,950
My god forbids mirrors.

499
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,990
But my mother, who was gorgeous,

500
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,110
used to say I was a pretty little boy."

501
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,700
Well...

502
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,950
Then your mother...

503
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,450
Sorely deceived you, Mr. merde!

504
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,740
He says he won't talk to you anymore.

505
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,990
He says, "it's not interesting."

506
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,450
"My mother was a Saint!

507
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,910
You all...

508
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,160
You all raped her!

509
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,070
And I am your son!"

510
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,450
Warders!

511
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,940
Make the defendant sit!

512
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,280
Silence!

513
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,320
Defendant, do you understand

514
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:47,610
that you risk the death penalty?

515
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,530
"No. I don't want that.

516
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,610
I'm against it."

517
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:37,910
Hang merde! Hang merde!

518
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:44,200
Hang merde! Hang merde!

519
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:53,900
Hang merde! Hang merde!

520
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,620
Free merde! Free merde!

521
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,240
Free merde! Free merde!

522
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,190
Free merde! Free merde!

523
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:23,910
Today, the pope condemned
Mr. merde's appalling crimes.

524
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,440
In Japan, ultra-nationalists

525
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,950
are violently demonstrating

526
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,280
to demand the death penalty.

527
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:39,030
But in the eyes of many
Mr. merde has become a star.

528
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,700
The trial's outcome
will be announced tomorrow.

529
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:02,280
Condemned to death!

530
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:14,280
Three years later

531
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:48,450
He wants you to warn your client
he'll be hanged in an hour.

532
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,160
He said, "no."

533
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,650
Ask him what he wants
for his last meal.

534
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,450
"Flowers...

535
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,580
And cash."

536
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,910
He's asking for a last cigarette.

537
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,990
What's he doing?

538
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,580
He's praying.

539
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,580
Execute him.

540
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,240
Dead.

541
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,370
- It's completed.
- Yes.

542
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,610
Later.

543
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,450
"The sky has grown old."

544
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,240
Oh! He's gone!

545
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,830
Coming soon:

546
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,110
The adventures of Mr. merde in New York

547
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:41,990
How long will it take
before this circle disappears?

548
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,030
10 seconds, 10 minutes,

549
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,370
10 hours, 10 days,

550
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:53,580
10 months, 10 years...

551
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,910
I've been living in this house
for 10 years.

552
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,190
I am a hikikomori.

553
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:10,700
Hikikomori

554
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:19,940
usually, hikikomoris live
at the expense of their parents,

555
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,780
but I live alone.

556
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,700
Defecating with the door open,
I don't care.

557
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,990
Falling asleep while defecating,

558
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,620
I don't care.

559
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,990
Strangely,
I don't watch television.

560
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,200
When was the last time I watched it?

561
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,950
However, I feed myself every day.

562
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,490
I don't need a table.

563
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:58,030
Those who are sensitive
would have noticed,

564
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,030
but my own way of tidying up,
practiced for 10 years

565
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,570
has now reached the level of art.

566
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,070
It's hard to believe,

567
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,990
but I have read all these books.

568
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:24,110
Lately, reading magazines
about climbing, fishing

569
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,070
and traveling,

570
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,320
suddenly makes me miss home.

571
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,950
I never go into the room
that my father used.

572
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,700
The envelope of money my father sends,

573
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,580
I open it every month.

574
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,740
The first year,

575
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:49,750
money came with a letter.

576
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:52,620
For the next nine years,

577
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,030
only money.

578
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,450
Brand new crisp banknotes.

579
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,910
How exciting.

580
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:07,530
With money and a telephone,
everything is okay

581
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,940
as everything can be delivered.

582
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,360
The bell is ringing. I open the door.

583
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,820
I take. I give.

584
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,530
I close the door.

585
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,280
With the delivery men,

586
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:24,450
I never make eye contact.

587
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,580
On Saturdays, I always order a pizza.

588
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:34,240
So you never look at people's faces?

589
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,740
Right.

590
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:41,110
I hated having contact with people.

591
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:50,820
I hated having contact
with the sunlight too.

592
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,530
I like watching the sunlight.

593
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,830
I can see it...

594
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,200
The movement of the sunlight.

595
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,870
Others may not,

596
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:32,610
but I can even see
the hour hand moving.

597
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,530
Everything is moving.

598
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,110
It has been 10 years

599
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,610
since I last moved.

600
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:16,580
It has been 11 years

601
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,660
living in the house.

602
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,160
Strictly speaking,

603
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,040
I am a hikikomori.

604
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:40,120
When I eat while standing,
I digest better.

605
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,530
When I fall asleep on the toilet,

606
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,690
I have sweet dreams.

607
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:53,240
The reading continues.

608
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,910
The smell of my father...

609
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,320
Saturday is pizza day.

610
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,950
With the delivery men,
I don't make any...

611
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:23,240
The first eye contact in 11 years.

612
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,290
Excuse me...

613
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:35,150
Buttons?

614
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:54,280
C-o0-m...

615
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:56,820
C-o0-m...

616
01:25:56,870 --> 01:26:00,070
Coma.

617
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,780
Did you push it?

618
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,610
- Yes.
- You did?

619
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:21,240
There's a mistake.

620
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,990
The eighth one from the floor.

621
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,280
On the right.

622
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:54,650
This place is really perfect.

623
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:18,750
This smell is really awful.

624
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,790
Because of the shock, for two days,

625
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:44,040
I couldn't do anything.

626
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:53,570
Even if I don't do anything
to start with.

627
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,280
What's wrong with me?

628
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,990
It's shaking.

629
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:23,490
Pizza's end?

630
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,870
I'm sorry about the other day.

631
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:37,650
I blew on your arm.

632
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:41,030
My thump is long...

633
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,790
Thank you very much...

634
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:50,370
How dare you answer me?

635
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:52,950
I'm not joking, cut the crap.

636
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,610
A guy like you,
I'll cut off both his hands and feet

637
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:59,120
to make sashimi.

638
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,400
Bring me some water.

639
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,400
It's me.

640
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:27,410
Don't hang up.

641
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:31,570
The weather is dull
and I wasn't in a good mood.

642
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,190
Sorry.

643
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:38,440
I said I'm sorry, punk!

644
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,690
You're really getting on my nerves.

645
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:44,780
You're not even good at delivering

646
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:48,120
and who do you think you're talking to?

647
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,490
I paid your two-weeks salary,

648
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,740
you should be grateful.

649
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:55,950
Are you trying to say you are hurt?

650
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,080
Well, I am hurt as much as you.

651
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,580
Cut the crap, punk!

652
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:04,570
I am much more introverted than you are!

653
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,080
Moron!

654
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,950
Excuse me.

655
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,570
The girl who is working at your place...

656
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:17,490
Is it her day off today?

657
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,360
Who?

658
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,830
Pale complexion...

659
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:30,650
Garter belt...

660
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,490
Buttons...?

661
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,410
She's my wife.

662
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,700
Just kidding.

663
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,160
She also quit yesterday.

664
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,910
She stopped delivering?

665
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:59,240
This is really perfect.

666
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,610
The little one said...

667
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,360
She'd never come out again.

668
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:16,780
You all must be crazy.

669
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:22,750
She had been working for some time.

670
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,160
Where does she live?

671
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:32,740
3 daizawa, I think.

672
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:35,200
Don't bother about the pizza.

673
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,950
When a hikikomori

674
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,860
wants to meet a hikikomori,

675
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,570
there is only one way.

676
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,820
What a blinding light.

677
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:39,660
It's so hot.

678
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:43,780
I hate sweating.

679
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:46,900
I should've brought a bottle of water.

680
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,950
Why did I come out?

681
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,690
Right. 3 daizawa...

682
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,830
Which way? This way!

683
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:59,080
To the left.

684
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,400
No, the bus is better.

685
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,450
Oh! Not this way.

686
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,360
Right, I don't have any money.

687
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,530
Nobody must see me.

688
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:20,450
Which way should I go?

689
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,240
Yes, of course.

690
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:26,200
Great.

691
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:30,030
Thisis it. This is it.

692
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,910
Passing by sangenjaya...

693
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:36,870
How should I get there?

694
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:39,370
Let's use this anyway.

695
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:43,200
I can be there in 30 minutes.

696
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:48,690
That's enough time.

697
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,830
Whatever.

698
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,080
Let's go.

699
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:54,490
Let's walk. Off we go.

700
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:59,990
Good. Full steam ahead.

701
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:04,360
Good. Good.

702
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:24,740
Excuse me.

703
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:29,870
I would...

704
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:25,780
They all went back in.

705
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,860
All of them.

706
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,450
This man...

707
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,410
I was like him five years ago.

708
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,860
For her, it must have been 10 years...

709
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,370
15 years?

710
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:10,450
This guy is a rookie.

711
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,860
As for her...

712
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,910
Come out, please.

713
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,070
Quick, come out.

714
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:59,700
If you don't come out now,

715
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:02,660
you never will.

716
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:09,900
Listen to me.

717
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:12,490
Open the door!

718
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,530
At least, tell me your name.

719
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:30,740
It's collapsing! Collapsing!

720
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:33,410
Come out!

721
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:37,240
Everybody, come out!

722
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:41,410
Come out!

723
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,820
Come out!

724
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,320
What is she waiting for?

725
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,910
Don't go back.

726
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,530
Don't touch me!

727
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,030
Don't go back in.

728
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,080
I pushed it.

729
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,620
It's shaking.
