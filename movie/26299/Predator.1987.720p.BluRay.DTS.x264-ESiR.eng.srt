1
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:59,650
You're looking
good, Dutch.

2
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,192
It's been a long time,
General.

3
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:03,625
Come on inside.

4
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,697
188 hours ago,
we lost a chopper

5
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,894
carrying a cabinet minister
and his aide

6
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,903
from this charming
little country.

7
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,668
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position about here.

8
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:19,505
This cabinet minister,
does he always travel

9
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:21,476
on the wrong side
of the border?

10
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,048
Apparently,
they strayed off course.

11
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,516
And we're fairly certain
they're in guerrilla hands.

12
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:31,578
Why don't you use
the regular army? Why us?

13
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:36,218
Because some damned fool
accused you of being the best.

14
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,098
Dillon!

15
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,831
You son of a bitch!

16
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,344
What's the matter?

17
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:57,415
The CIA got you pushing
too many pencils?

18
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:58,744
Huh?

19
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,611
Had enough?

20
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:05,690
Make it easy
on yourself, Dutch.

21
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,588
Ok! Ok!

22
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:12,255
You never did know
when to quit.

23
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,763
Damn good to see you.

24
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,300
What is this
fucking tie business?

25
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:20,303
I heard about that job
you pulled off in Berlin.

26
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,804
Very nice, Dutch.

27
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,306
Good old days.

28
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:25,808
How come you passed
on Libya?

29
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:27,310
That wasn't my style.

30
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:30,313
You got no style.
You know that.

31
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,815
Come on.
Why did you pass?

32
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,946
We're a rescue team,
not assassins.

33
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,823
Now, what do we
got to do?

34
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,557
That cabinet minister is
important to our operations

35
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,656
in this part of the world.

36
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,827
Our friends are about
to get squeezed.

37
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:55,168
We can't let that happen.
We need the best... you.

38
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,468
Go on.

39
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,839
Simple setup.
One-day operation.

40
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:02,778
We pick up their trail
at the chopper, run them down,

41
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,712
grab those hostages,
and bounce back.

42
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,785
What do you mean, "we"?

43
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,285
I'm going in
with you, Dutch.

44
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,619
General, my team
always works alone.

45
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,659
You know that.

46
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:21,192
Once you reach
your objective,

47
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,667
Dillon will evaluate
the situation and take charge.

48
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,974
? Gonna tell Aunt Mary
about UncleJohn?

49
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,411
? He claims he has the misery,
but he has a lot of fun?

50
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:37,914
? Oh, baby?

51
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:40,450
? Yeah, baby?

52
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:43,419
? Whoo, baby?

53
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:45,422
? Havin'me some fun tonight?

54
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:46,957
? Yeah?

55
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,425
? Well, Long Tall Sally,
she's built sweet, she got?

56
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:50,927
Yeah, ok.

57
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,428
? Everything that UncleJohn need?

58
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:53,896
? Oh, baby?

59
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,229
? Yeah, baby?

60
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:59,031
? Whoo, baby?

? Havin'me some fun tonight?

62
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,871
? Yeah?

63
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:05,535
? Well, I saw UncleJohn
with bald-head Sally?

64
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,044
? He saw Aunt Mary comin; and
he ducked back in the alley?

65
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:09,545
? Oh, baby?

66
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,878

00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,047
? Yeah, aaah?

00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,234

71
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,701
Yeah.

72
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:36,740
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

73
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:40,437
AWACS contact
on four-hour intervals.

74
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,603
Who's our backup?

75
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,739
No such thing.
This is a one-way ticket.

76
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,251
Once we cross that border,
we're on our own.

77
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:51,686
This is getting better
by the minute.

78

? She's built sweet,
she got?

79
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,022
? Everything
that UncleJohn need?

80
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:56,594
? Oh, baby?

81
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,129
? Yeah, baby?

00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,756
? Whoo, baby?

? Havin'me

84
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,399
? Yeah?

85
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,995
? Well, Long Tall Sally,
she's built sweet, she got?

86
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,539
Hey, Billy.

87
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:10,539
? Everything?

88
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:12,041
Billy, the other day

89
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:15,045
I went up to my girlfriend.
I said,

90
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,047
"I'd like
a little pussy."

91
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,983
She said, " Me, too.
Mine's as big as a house!"

92
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:22,986
She wanted
a littler one

93
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:24,248
'cause hers was...

94
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:26,551
? And he ducked
back in the alley?

95
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,886
Big as a house.

96
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:30,655
? Yeah, baby?

97
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:33,060
? Whoo, baby?

That was in '72.

got one round in the head.

stripped the shit out of it.

Heat-seeker, Dillon.

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,089
Pretty sophisticated for
half-assed mountain boys.

something else.

What?

148
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,442
Six men wearing
U.S. Issued army boots.

149
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:49,604
They came in
from the north,

150

and then followed
the guerrillas.

Probably just
another rebel patrol.

I've seen some
bad-ass bush before, man,

345
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:48,219
but nothing
like this.

00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:52,227
I hear you.
This shit's something.

347

look like Kansas.

Hey, que pasa, amigo?

349
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,393
Little taste of home.

350
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:05,173
You lose it here,

351
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:07,675
you're in a world
of hurt.

352
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:16,184
Come on, sweetheart.

353
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:18,686
Stop sandbaggin' it.
Now, get up.

354

Come on, get up.
Would you get up?

355
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,686
Mierda!

356
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:28,094
Ni lo intentes.

357
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,637
Maybe you better
put her on a leash.

358
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:46,047
Try it again...
please.

so spooked?

00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:54,716
Can't say, Major.

362
00:38:54,818 --> 00:38:57,719
Been acting squirrely
all morning.

363
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,222
That damn nose of his...
it's weird.

365
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:48,695
Billy.

366
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:54,709
What the hell
is wrong with you?

367
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:00,411
There's something
in those trees.

368
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,253
Do you see anything?

369
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,756
Up there.

370
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,554
Nothing.

371
00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:47,628
What do you think?

372
00:40:53,904 --> 00:40:56,099
I guess
it's nothing, Major.

This isn't her blood.

did you do to him?

I think it's Hawkins.

Where the hell
is his body?

There's no sign of it.

Ask her what happened.

Que paso, mujer?

395
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:04,553
Mujer, que paso?

396
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:07,960
Que fue lo que viste?
Quien fue?

397
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:09,463
Yo no se.

398
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,898
Dime, mujer!
Quien fue? I Dime!

399

La selva se lo llevo.

No estoy segura.
No se.

401
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,471
She says the jungle,
it just came alive

402
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,010
and took him.

403
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:24,342
Bullshit! That's not
what she said!

404
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,847
What she said
doesn't make sense.

405
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,747
Those sappers
have followed us...

406
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:31,047
they've been
in front of us!

407
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:32,416

408
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:33,955
Hold it!

00:44:34,057 --> 00:44:37,185
Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

410
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:39,193
Why didn't she escape?

00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:45,434
What?

413
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:50,368
They did the same thing
toJim Hopper.

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,799
I saw it.

No powder burns,
no shrapnel.

fused, cauterized.

done this to a man?

I don't know, goddamn it.

not a fucking trace.

00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:28,876
Put him in his poncho.
Take him with us.

443
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:30,377
I got him.

Vamonos.

445
00:51:34,443 --> 00:51:38,743
Major, I set up flares,
frags, and claymores.

446
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:40,748
Nothing's coming
near this place

447
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,681

on something.

448

Mac.

450
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:50,891
He was a good soldier.

451
00:51:52,995 --> 00:51:56,453
He was, um...

452
00:51:56,566 --> 00:51:57,794
my friend.

453
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:07,301

456
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,267
Say again, Blazer 18.
Say again.

Expendable assets.

467

I can accept it.

468
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:47,700

going to do anyhow.

475
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:05,819
I don't know.

476
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,322
I only saw one of them
camouflaged.

477
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:11,325
He was there.

478
00:55:11,427 --> 00:55:14,419
Those eyes disappeared.

479
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,020
What was that?

480
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:18,760
Those eyes, they...

481
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:21,336
they disappeared.

482
00:55:21,437 --> 00:55:23,064
I know one thing.

483
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:26,107
I drew and
fired straight at it.

484
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:29,769
Capped off 200 rounds
in the minigun,

485
00:55:29,879 --> 00:55:31,278
full pack.

486
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,872
Nothing on this earth
could have lived,

487

not at that range.

488

first watch,

489
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:45,292
then you
get some rest.

490
00:55:45,394 --> 00:55:47,794
Ask her what she saw.

491

Ask her what happened
to Hawkins.

492
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,891
Go ahead, ask her.

493
00:55:53,002 --> 00:55:54,799
Que paso hoy?

494
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:57,771
Que fue lo que viste?

495
00:55:57,873 --> 00:56:00,239
Te dijo lo que se.

496
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:02,572
Fue la selva
que se lo llevo.

497
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:04,407

fucking thing.

and took him.
