00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,000
阿諾·施瓦辛格

4
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,540
片名：鐵血戰士

5
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,580
你看來很精神 達奇
You're looking good, Dutch.

6
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,180
很久不見了 將軍
It's been a long time, General.

7
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,920
進去裏面談吧
Come on inside.

8
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,670
18小時前
Eighteen hours ago,

9
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,020
我們在這小國失去一架直升機
we lost a chopper carrying a cabinet minister

10
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,030
上面載著內閣成員及其助理
and his aide from this charming little country.

11
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,900
收到的訊號顯示 他們的位置大約在這裏
We've got a transponder fix on their position about here.

12
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,300
這位內閣成員...
This cabinet minister...

13
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,300
喜歡亂竄嗎
does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?

14
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,040
是直升機偏離原定航道
Apparently they strayed off course...

15
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,040
他們肯定落入了游擊隊手中
and we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

16
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,910
為什麼不用正規部隊去營救他們
Why don't you use the regular army?

17
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,910
而要用我們這些特種部隊
What do you need us for?

18
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,830
因為有笨蛋認為你們是最好的 指定要你們
'Cause some damned fool accused you of being the best.

19
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:49,040
狄龍! 你這賤人...
Dillon! You son of a bitch!

20
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,740
怎麼了?
What's the matter?

21
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,770
CIA讓你坐太久辦公室嗎?
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils?

22
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,380
夠了嗎?
Had enough?

23
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,450
你可以放輕鬆些的
Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

24
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,450
好吧...好吧...好吧!
OK! OK, OK.

25
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,950
你永遠不知什麼時候該停
You never knew when to quit.

26
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,860
真高興又見到你!
Damn good to see you.

27
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,260
你這條領帶算是什麼?
What's this fucking tie business?

28
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,460
算了 別談我的領帶啦
Come on. Forget about my tie.

29
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,900
我聽說你在柏林的那次任務
I heard about that job you pulled in Berlin.

30
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,160
完美漂亮 達奇
Very nice, Dutch.

31
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,700
就像美好的舊時光
Good old days.

32
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,170
是啊 美好的舊時光
Yeah, I like the good old days.

33
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,900
為什麼你不參加利比亞的那次行動?
Then how come you passed on Libya?

34
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,470
轟炸不是我喜歡的作戰方式
That wasn't my style.

35
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,970
你可沒有特定的作戰方式
You got no style. You know that.

36
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,270
別這樣告訴我
Come on.

37
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,760
你為什麼不肯參加呢?
Why did you pass?

38
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,710
我們是拯救小組...
We're a rescue team...

39
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,780
而不是暗殺小組
not assassins.

40
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,620
我們這次的任務是什麼?
Now, what do we got to do?

41
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,130
這位內閣成員
The cabinet minister's important

42
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,620
對我們在這地區很重要
to our scope of operations in this part of the world.

43
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,490
達奇 將軍的意思是說...
The general's saying a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed.

44
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,470
我們不能讓他們被害
We can't let that happen.

45
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,500
我們需要最好的小組
We need the best.

46
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,130
這就是你的小組在此的原因
That's why you're here.

47
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,330
繼續說
Go on.

48
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,600
很簡單的行動 一天就能搞定
Simple setup. One- day operation.

49
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,400
我們到直升機那裏尋找游擊隊的足跡
We pick up their trail at the chopper, grab those hostages,

50
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,110
救出人質 在他們發現之前
and bounce back, and cross the border...

51
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,710
我們已經越過邊境回來
before anybody knows we were there.

52
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,310
"我們"是什麼意思
What do you mean, "we"?

53
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,250
我跟你們一起行動
I'm going in with you, Dutch.

54
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,520
將軍 你知道我的隊伍一向是單獨行動的
General, my team always works alone. You know that.

55
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,650
抱歉 少校 我們各有各的命令
We all have our orders, Major.

56
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,720
一旦完成任務後
Once you reach your objective...

57
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,130
狄龍將接管這次行動
Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.

58
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,380
目的地已標在地圖上 無線電頻道也已調好
Rendezvous points and radio freqs are indicated and fixed.

59
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,140
每四小時跟指揮部聯絡一次
AWACs contact on four- hour intervals.

60
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,240
誰是我們的支援?
Who's our backup?

61
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,100
沒有支援 老朋友
No such thing, ol' buddy.

62
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,410
這是單程任務
This is a one- way ticket.

63
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,850
我們越過邊界 一切就只能靠自己
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

64
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,720
這任務越聽越有趣
This is getting better by the minute.

65
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,470
比利! 有天我去我女朋友那裏...
Hey, Billy. The other day, I went up to my girlfriend.

66
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,840
我對她說 "我想跟你做愛"
I said, l'd like a little pussy.

67
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,150
她說 "我也是 我的跟房子一樣大"
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house!"

68
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,750
知道嗎 她希望性器小 因為她的...
See, she wanted a littler one 'cause hers was...

69
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,650
跟房子一樣大...
big as a house.

70
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,970
把那噁心的煙草拿遠一點
Get that stinking shit out of my face, will ya?

71
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,900
都是愚蠢的無能弱者
Bunch of slack- jawed faggots around here!

72
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,320
煙草可令你跟我一樣
This stuff will make you a damn sexual tyrannosaurus

73
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,900
成性超人
just like me.

74
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,180
塞到屁眼裏去吧 佈雷
Yeah? Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

75
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,990
這打火機是72年在北越
That was in '72.

76
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,690
我跟達奇各得一個作獎勵
Me and Dutch both got one.

77
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,440
嚼煙草真的是個很噁心的習慣
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

78
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,440
到了
Right.

79
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,080
你知道我多懷念跟你一起戰鬥
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

80
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,750
你啥時有這麼聰明了
You never were that smart.

81
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,260
霍金斯 去吧!
Hawkins, you're up.

82
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,530
準備好了
Lines away.

83
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,600
直升機是頭部中彈的
The pilots have each got one round in the head.

84
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,910
他們搶走了裏面所有東西
Whoever hit it, stripped the shit out of it.

85
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,130
游擊隊是用熱導彈把它擊落
Took him out with a heat- seeker.

86
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,070
還有 少校
Something else, Major.

87
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,940
什麼事?
Ehn?

88
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,880
這不是一架普通的直升機
This is no ordinary army taxi.

89
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,750
在我看來更像偵查機
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

90
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,450
找到他們留下的足跡了嗎?
Pick up the trail yet?

91
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,250
比利正在找
Billy's on it.

92
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,150
狄龍 這事越來越複雜
Heat- seeker, Dillon.

93
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,460
游擊隊怎麼會有熱導彈
That's pretty sophisticated for half- assed mountain boys.

94
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,990
少校
Major

95
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
我想他們的裝備越來越好了
I guess they're getting better equipped every day.

96
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,960
原來有12個人
There were 12 guerrillas.

97
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,260
游擊隊把他們從直升機捉走
They took the two men from the helicopter...

98
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,670
但是 還有別的足跡...
but there's something else.

99
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,500
什麼意思?
What?

100
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,570
有六個穿美國陸軍軍鞋的人
Six men wearing US- issued army boots.

101
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,630
他們是從北方來的
They came in from the north

102
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,980
他們一路追蹤那些游擊隊
and then they followed the guerrillas.

103
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,780
這事你知道嗎?
Mean anything to you?

104
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,080
可能只是另一組游擊隊罷了
Probably just another rebel patrol.

105
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,180
他們經常在這一帶出沒
They operate in here all the time.

106
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,120
- 你去看看能發現些什麼 - 是 長官
- See what you can find. - Yes, sir.

107
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,720
比利找到什麼?
What's he got?

108
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,120
跟以前的一樣
Same business.

109
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,300
游擊隊捉走了兩個人
Guerrillas hauling two guys in the chopper...

110
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,060
被一些穿美軍裝備的人追蹤
followed by men with American equipment.

111
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,560
還記得上次在阿富汗嗎?
Do you remember Afghanistan?

112
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,730
嘗試把它忘記吧! 來
Trying to forget it. Come on. Let's go.

113
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,620
聖母瑪麗亞...
Holy mother of God.

114
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,450
吉米·霍普
"Jim Hopper."

115
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,860
麥克 將他們放下來
Mac, cut them down.

116
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,260
我認得他是北卡州部隊的
I knew these men. Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.

117
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,070
他們來這裏做什麼?
What the hell were they doing here?

118
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,800
我不知道 達奇
I don't know, Dutch.

119
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,610
這太不人道了!
This is inhuman.

120
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,710
沒有人告訴我這區域有活動
Nobody told me there was an operation in this area.

121
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,510
他們不應該在這裏
They shouldn't have been here.

122
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,580
是有人派他們來的
Well, somebody sent them.

123
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,120
游擊隊把他們剝皮?
The guerrillas skinned them?

124
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,690
他們為什麼要這樣做?
Why did they skin them?

125
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,990
軍人不應是這樣死法的
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

126
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,430
比利 到底發生什麼事?
What happened here, Billy?

127
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,000
很奇怪 少校
Strange, Major.

128
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,300
這裏曾經發生槍戰
There was a fire fight.

129
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,900
他們向四面八方盲目射擊
They were shooting in all directions.

130
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,110
我無法想像吉米會走進埋伏
Can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.

131
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,110
我不相信他中了埋伏
I don't believe he did.

132
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,750
我找不到半點痕跡
I can't find a single track.

133
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,410
完全沒有道理
Just doesn't make sense.

134
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,520
霍普其他的隊員呢?
What about the rest of Hopper's men?

135
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,320
沒有他們的蹤跡
There's no sign, sir.

136
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,460
他們根本沒有離開這裏
They never left here.

137
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,730
他們就像突然消失了一樣
Hell, it's like they just disappeared.

138
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,730
繼續追蹤游擊隊的足跡 我們去救人質
Stick with the guerrilla trail. Let's get the hostages.

139
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,230
出發吧
We move,

140
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,140
每個人隔5公尺 不要作聲!
five- meter spread. No sound.

141
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,650
是時候把武器拿出來了
It's time to let Old Painless out of the bag.

142
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,950
血債血償的時間
Payback time.

143
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,070
你這討厭的傢伙在做什麼?
You're ghostin' us, mother fucker.

144
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,850
我不管你有多重要
I don't care who you are back in the world.

145
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,480
如果你再不小心暴露行蹤
You give our position one more time...

146
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,090
我會神不知鬼不覺的讓你流血
I'll bleed you real quiet

147
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,590
讓你留下來等死
and leave you here.

148
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,660
你聽清楚了嗎?
Got that?

149
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,260
他們殺了一個人質!
He killed one of the hostages.

150
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,360
我們準備進攻
We move.

151
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,320
麥克和佈雷對付機槍堡
Mac, Blain...the nest.

152
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,030
比利和賓對付警衛
Billy, Poncho...the guard.

153
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,760
霍金斯和狄龍作支援
Hawkins, Dillon...backup.

154
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,260
一切佈署好後 我便攻擊他們的燃料庫
Once they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

155
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,840
解決了一個
One down.

156
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,120
他在做什麼?
What the hell's he doing?

157
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,610
搞什麼?
What the fuck?

158
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,850
表演時間到
Show time, kid.

159
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,950
目標是中央那房屋
Target's the center, on the upper level!

160
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,610
小心九點方向!
Dutch, on your nine!

161
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,770
解決那個!
Get that mother!

162
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,790
釘在此處吧
Stick around.

163
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,090
人質在裏面
Hostages are inside!

164
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,400
你好嗎?
Knock knock.

165
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,410
我去追截他們
I got 'em !

166
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,940
霍金斯 通知指揮部我們現在的位置及狀況
Hawkins, call in position and situation.

167
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,510
用無線電跟指揮部聯絡
Get Connor for the hook!

168
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,550
知道 少校!
You got it, Major.

169
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,860
該死
Shit.

170
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,120
麥克
Mac,

171
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,930
找到其他的人質嗎?
any sign of the other hostage?

172
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,130
找到另外一個 也已經死了
Found the other guy. He's dead, too...

173
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,930
還找到從直升機拆下的齒輪
and the kid from the chopper.

174
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,640
如果他們是中美洲人 那我就是中國人了
But if they're Central American, l'm a Goddamn Chinaman.

175
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,770
這樣說那閣員應是CIA
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was CIA.

176
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,640
還有 我們運氣不錯
Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

177
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,240
除了游擊隊外 還有蘇聯軍事顧問
Other guys we waxed...Russian military advisers.

178
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,250
看來有大規模軍事計劃進行
Something pretty big was gonna happen here.

179
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,550
做得好 麥克
Good work, Mac.

180
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,450
清理一下現場 不要留下蛛絲馬跡
Clear the area. No traces.

181
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,380
叫大家準備離去
Get the men ready to move.

182
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,590
好的
Right.

183
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,860
那雜種待在那裏死也不走開
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

184
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,370
你中了彈 在流血!
You're hit. You're bleeding, man.

185
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,170
我沒時間流血
I ain't got time to bleed.

186
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,910
好吧
Oh...OK.

187
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,780
有時間躲一躲嗎?
You got time to duck?

188
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,330
真他媽漂亮!
This is goddamn beautiful.

189
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,230
中正頭獎!
Goddamn jackpot.

190
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,290
比想像中更多機密!
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

191
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,600
給我們一網打盡
Now we got those bastards.

192
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,100
捉個正著
We got 'em.

193
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,620
我想這才是你要找的東西
I think this is what you're looking for.

194
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,940
你利用我們!
You set us up!

195
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,180
你告訴我的都是廢話 你騙我們!
It's all bullshit! All of it.

196
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,050
什麼內閣成員等等...
The cabinet minister, the whole business.

197
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,900
騙我們來這裏替你賣命
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

198
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,110
我們剛阻止一次大型入侵
We just stopped a major invasion.

199
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,930
他們本來三天內便會侵略
In three days, they'd have crossed the border with the stuff.

200
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,750
為什麼挑我們?
Why us?

201
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,320
沒其他人能完成這任務
Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

202
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,520
騙你是因為不這樣的話你不會來
You're pissed about the cover story? I needed it to get you in here.

203
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,520
那你告訴霍普什麼樣的故事
What story did you hand Hopper?

204
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,830
我們花了幾個月才找到這裏
Look, we've been looking for this place for months.

205
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,130
那架直升機被擊中時 我的手下在裏面
My men were in that chopper when it got hit!

206
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,970
霍普是要來拯救我的手下
Hopper was supposed to get them.

207
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,860
而他卻不見了
He disappeared.

208
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,930
他沒有失蹤 他是被活活的剝了皮
He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive!

209
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,640
而我的命令就是 送能消滅兇手的人到這裏
My orders were to get somebody to crack these bastards!

210
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,080
所以你編故事騙我們來送死
So you cooked up a story and dropped us in a meat grinder.

211
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,760
你是怎麼了 狄龍?
What happened to you, Dillon?

212
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,450
你以前是個值得信賴的人啊!
You used to be somebody I could trust.

213
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,280
我清醒了
I woke up.

214
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,590
你為什麼不能醒過來?
Why don't you?

215
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,960
你是項資產...
You're an asset...

216
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,660
一項可以犧牲的資產
an expendable asset...

217
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,160
我用你來完成任務
and I used you to get the job done.

218
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,060
明白嗎?
Got it?

219
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,000
我的手下不是可以隨便犧牲的!
My men are not expendable.

220
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,770
我也不做這種事!
And I don't do this kind of work.

221
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,170
少校! 少校!
Major! Major!

222
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,810
我們有麻煩!
We stepped into some real shit here.

223
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,880
空中偵查說到處都是游擊隊
Air surveillance says we got guerillas all over the place.

224
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,280
就在一兩公里範圍內
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

225
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,020
他們大概多久會到?
How much time?

226
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,280
半個小時內
Half hour, maybe less.

227
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,820
告訴麥克 五分鐘後出發
Tell Mac we move in five.

228
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,890
等一等 她跟我們一起走
Wait. She goes with us.

229
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,720
她非常有價值
She's too valuable.

230
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,990
她一定知道整個部署
She's got the whole of that work.

231
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,920
她一有機會便會洩露我們行蹤
She'll give away our position any chance she gets.

232
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,290
不行!
No deal.

233
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,890
少校 你必須聽我命令
You're still under orders, Major.

234
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,530
你下命令還是由我來?
You wanna make that call or should I?

235
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,700
你自己負責看著她
She's your baggage.

236
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,700
你跟不上的話 便自理
You fall behind, and you're on your own.

237
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,050
直升機在這裏升降太危險
Place is too hot for a pickup.

238
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,620
他們不會在這裏接我們 除非我們越過邊境
They won't touch us till we get over the border.

239
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,220
比利! 哪條路可以離開這裏
Hey, Billy, give me a way out of this hole.

240
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,050
空中偵查說我們被包圍
Aerial says we're cut off.

241
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,720
唯一的出路是那山谷 它會把我們引向東邊
The only way out is that valley that leads east...

242
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,360
那條路非常險峻
but I wouldn't wish that on a broke- dick dog.

243
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,070
我們沒得選擇
Not much choice.

244
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,530
賓 你開路 盡快前進!
Poncho, take lead. Double- time it.

245
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,450
放開我

246
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,180
還有很長的路要走

247
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,750
你給我乖一點

248
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,550
狄龍
Dillon!

249
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,460
狄龍 過來
Dillon! Over here.

250
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,510
轉身
Turn around.

251
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,710
為什麼?
Why?

252
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,120
謝謝!
Thanks.

253
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,990
好說!
Anytime.

254
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,480
比利!
Billy! Billy!

255
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,900
有天我對女朋友說
The other day, I was going down on my girlfriend...

256
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,580
你的性器很大
and I said to her"Jeez, you got a big pussy.

257
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,210
你的性器很大...
Jeez, you got a big pussy."

258
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,130
她問為什麼要說兩次
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"

259
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,710
我說我沒有說兩次啊!
And I said, "l didn't."

260
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:56,620
明白嗎? 因為洞太大 有回音...
See, it was because of the echo. It was...

261
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,050
這裏 這裏...
Over here. Over here. Over here.

262
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,060
轉身 轉身
Turn around. Turn around.

263
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,060
轉身 轉身 這裏
Turn around. Turn around. Over here.

264
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,070
好說
Anytime.

265
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,080
好說
Anytime.

266
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,840
他媽的!
Goddamn. Whew.

267
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,880
老兄
Buddy, buddy, buddy.

268
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:48,080
我以前也去過可怕的叢林 但都比不上這裏
I've seen some bad- ass bush before, but nothing like this.

269
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,350
同意 這地方真是怪異
I hear you. This shit's something.

270
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,950
柬埔寨和這比 都成天堂了
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

271
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,660
喝點這個吧
Que pasa, amigo?

272
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,600
有點家的味道!
A little taste off home.

273
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,400
在這種地方失去自我控制 就麻煩了
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

274
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,510
不要拖延我們 起來
Come on, sweetheart. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now get up.

275
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,480
快起來!
Come on, get up.

276
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,530
你起不起來?
Would you get up?

277
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,890
不用浪費力氣了
Ni lo intentes.

278
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,130
也許你應用皮帶牽著她走
Maybe you better put her on a leash, agent man.

279
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,220
你有膽再一試!
Try it again...please.

280
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,870
別動!
Callate.

281
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,310
比利為什麼這樣緊張害怕?
What's got Billy so spooked?

282
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,610
我也不知道 少校
Can't say, Major.

283
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,020
一早就這樣了
Been acting squirrelly all morning.

284
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,490
他那鼻子是很奇怪的
That damn nose of his...it's weird.

285
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,560
是什麼 比利?
What is it? Billy.

286
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,770
你沒問題吧?
What the hell is wrong with you?

287
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,450
那樹上有些東西
There's something in those trees.

288
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,460
你看到上面有什麼?
Do you see anything? Up there ahead.

289
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,420
什麼也看不到
Nothing.

290
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,630
你認為是什麼?
What do you think?

291
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,230
我想可能沒什麼吧 少校
I guess it's nothing, Major.

292
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,960
好了! 別再掙扎了
Please! Please!

293
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,060
比利 搜查左邊!
Billy, break back.

294
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,870
麥克 右邊!
Back right.

295
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,070
這是...
What the...

296
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,070
這不是她的血
This isn't her blood.

297
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,570
你將他怎樣了!
What the hell did you do to him?

298
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,970
少校 你最好來看一看!
Major, you better take a look at this.

299
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,740
你找到霍金斯了嗎?
Did you find Hawkins?

300
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,450
我...我也不知道
I...I can't tell.

301
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,100
老天爺!
What in God's name?

302
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,470
我想那是霍金斯的血
I think it's Hawkins.

303
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,470
那他的屍體呢?
Where the hell is his body?

304
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,070
不知所蹤
There's no sign of it.

305
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,220
問她到底發生什麼事
Ask her what happened.

306
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,560
究竟發生什麼事?

307
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,150
你到底看到什麼?

308
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,220
他在哪裏?

309
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,970
我什麼也沒看到

310
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,500
- 快說 - 我沒看到他去了哪裏

311
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,590
他在哪裏 快說

312
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:14,480
什麼?

313
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,800
她說這叢林活過來抓走了他
She says the jungle...it just came alive and took him.

314
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,340
放屁! 她不是這樣說的
Bullshit! That's not what she said!

315
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,140
她說的完全沒有道理
What she said doesn't make any sense.

316
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,410
游擊隊一直在追我們
Those sappers followed us...

317
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,240
亂說 他們在我們前面
Hell, they've been ahead of us!

318
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,210
這女人想趕到前面
This woman's been running us right to 'em !

319
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,510
別吵了
Hold it!

320
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,550
好了!
Hold it!

321
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,020
他們怎麼沒拿走他的 無線電或是武器?
Why didn't they take his radio or his weapon?

322
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:40,720
她為什麼沒逃走?
Why didn't she escape?

323
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,320
霍普!
Hopper.

324
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,860
什麼?
What?

325
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,040
他們像對付霍普一樣對霍金斯
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

326
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,540
搜尋霍金斯的屍體
I want Hawkins' body found.

327
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,740
掃蕩搜索隊形!
Sweep pattern.

328
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,540
往我們來的方向搜索 檢查這50公尺的範圍
Double back. 50 meters.

329
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,350
開始行動
Let's go.

330
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,290
出來吧 你們這些雜種
Come on in, you fuckers.

331
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,990
出來吧
Come on in.

332
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,300
我的武器在等待你們
Old Painless is waiting.

333
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,490
接觸敵人!
Sergeant!

334
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,930
出來吧 王八蛋!
Mother fucker! Fucker!

335
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:20,550
狗娘養的! 你這雜種
Mother fucker! You mother fucker!

336
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,720
發生什麼事?
What happened?

337
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,090
我看到它
I saw it.

338
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,720
你看到什麼?
You saw what?

339
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,830
我看到它
I saw it.

340
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,710
佈雷 身上沒有火藥痕跡
Blain. No powder burns,

341
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,620
沒有碎片
no shrapnel.

342
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,620
他的傷口是燒焦的
The wound's all fused, cauterized.

343
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,450
什麼東西會造成這樣的傷口
What the hell could have done this to a man?

344
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:45,530
麥克! 麥克 看著我!
Mac. Mac, look at me!

345
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,370
是誰做的?
Who did this?

346
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,130
我一點也不知道
I don't know, goddamn it.

347
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,740
我看到一些...一些東西
I saw s- something.

348
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,970
什麼也找不到
Not a thing,

349
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,540
一點痕跡也沒有
not a fucking trace.

350
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,340
沒有血跡...沒有屍體
No blood, no bodies.

351
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,540
我們什麼也沒打到!
We hit nothing.

352
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,950
狄龍 你最好快跟總部聯絡
Dillon...better get on the radio.

353
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,490
麥克!
Mac.

354
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,660
士官!
Sergeant!

355
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,390
是 長官
Yes, sir.

356
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,260
在山脊上佈置個防禦陣地
I want a defensive position above that ridge...

357
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,300
把所有爆炸品都準備好
mined with everything we've got.

358
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,470
把他放好 我們帶他一起走
Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.

359
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,670
我來辦!
I got him.

360
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,190
走吧!
Vamonos.

361
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,440
少校 我已經裝設好照明彈 手榴彈及地雷
Major...I set up flares, frags, and CIAymores.

362
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,370
沒有什麼能不碰到這些東西 進到這陣地來
Nothing's coming near this place without tripping on something.

363
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,280
謝謝你 士官
Thank you, sergeant.

364
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,150
麥克
Mac.

365
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,690
他是個好軍人
He was a good soldier.

366
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,900
他是...我的朋友
He was, um...my friend.

367
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,220
再見了 我的兄弟!
Good- bye, bro.

368
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:16,030
火焰一號 我重複
Blazer one, I repeat,

369
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,630
必須把我們撤離
extraction necessary.

370
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,860
再說一遍 火焰一號
Say again, Blazer one.

371
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,630
再說一遍
Say again.

372
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,870
你的要求不被接受
Request for extraction denied.

373
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,640
你的位置仍舊暴露在敵人的火力網下
Area is still compromised.

374
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,540
請前進到3000位置 我們在那裏接你們
Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner extraction. Priority, out.

375
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,370
下次聯絡時間是9:30
Next contact 0930.

376
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,180
知道了 火焰一號
Roger, Blazer one.

377
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,740
10:30聯絡
10:30 hours.

378
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,850
賤人
Damn bastards.

379
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,250
他們說我們的位置還太遠
They say we're still in too far,

380
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,250
他們不能冒險前來接我們
and they can't risk coming in.

381
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,050
我們是資產 狄龍
We're assets, Dillon.

382
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,750
可以犧牲的資產!
Expendable assets.

383
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,450
CIA就是這樣
It comes with the job.

384
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,360
這點我可以接受
I can accept it.

385
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,860
胡說 你跟我們一樣生氣
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

386
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,100
直升機不會來這裏就是了
Shitload of good a chopper's gonna do us in here anyhow.

387
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,170
士官
Sergeant?

388
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,270
士官! 士官!
Sergeant! Sergeant!

389
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,370
今天誰攻擊我們?
Who hit us today?

390
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,280
我不知道
I don't know.

391
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,980
我只看到一個有偽裝的東西
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

392
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,080
他在那裏
He was there.

393
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,620
那對眼睛...忽然消失了
Those eyes disappeared.

394
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,720
你說什麼?
What was that?

395
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,700
那對眼睛 他們...他們消失不見了
Those eyes, they...they disappeared.

396
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,290
我只知道一件事 少校
I know one thing, Major.

397
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,930
我對準向它射擊
I drew down and fired straight at it.

398
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,300
我射了200輪以上
Capped off 200 rounds in the minigun...

399
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,200
我把所有子彈射光了
Full pack.

400
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,000
但是一點用處也沒有
Nothing...

401
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:35,140
這世上沒有什麼東西 在那個範圍內
nothing on this earth could have lived.

402
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,850
還能生存的
Not at that range.

403
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:45,550
麥克 你站第一班 然後去休息一會
Mac, you take first watch then you get some rest, OK?

404
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,430
問她看到什麼? 問她霍金斯怎麼了?
Ask her what she saw. Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

405
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,660
問她吧!
Go ahead, ask her.

406
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,480
你看到什麼了

407
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,390
你看到什麼了

408
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,680
叢林活過來把他抓走

409
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,170
還是那句話
Same fucking thing.

410
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,740
叢林活過來把他抓走
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

411
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:11,840
比利 你一定知道些什麼 到底是什麼?
Billy, you know something. What is it?

412
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,280
我感到害怕
I'm scared, Poncho.

413
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:17,880
放屁! 你不怕任何人的
Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

414
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,450
外面有東西在等我們
There's something out there waiting for us...

415
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,390
而且並不是人
and it ain't no man.

416
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,070
我們全都會死
We're all gonna die.

417
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,670
這傢伙已經失去理智
The man's losing it. He's losing his cool.

418
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,870
只不過是有些敵人在附近
Nothing but a couple guys running around....

419
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,500
我們可以應付
and we gotta take 'em.

420
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,780
你還是不明白 狄龍
Still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

421
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,380
不管那是什麼
Whatever it is out there,

422
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,480
它殺了霍普
it killed Hopper...

423
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,980
現在它要殺死我們
and now it wants us.

424
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,220
我們又在一起了
Here we are again, bro...

425
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,690
只有你和我
just you and me.

426
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,030
一樣的月亮 一樣的叢林
Same kind of moon, same kind of jungle.

427
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,100
那晚我們喝酒來壯膽
Real number- ten night,

428
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,730
你還記得嗎?
remember?

429
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,430
整個部隊
Whole platoon...

430
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,900
32個人都被剁成肉醬
32 men chopped into meat...

431
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,300
除了你和我
and we walk out, just you and me.

432
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,010
再沒有別人
Nobody else.

433
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,410
我們是最好的戰士
Right on top of them.

434
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,040
這根本不算一回事
Not a scratch. Not a fucking scratch.

435
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,850
你知道不管是誰把你殺死
You know, whoever got you...

436
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,310
他會回來找我們
he'll come back again,

437
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,120
只要他敢回來
and when he does...

438
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:33,620
我會把你的名字刻在他身上
I'm going to cut your name into him.

439
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,540
什麼事?
What the hell is it?

440
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,540
麥克!
Mac!

441
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,710
這邊!
This way!

442
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,000
- 你在那裏 麥克? - 在這邊
- Where are you? - Over here!

443
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,950
你在那裏?
Where are you?

444
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,050
麥克!
Mac!

445
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:09,300
麥克! 該死!
Mac! Fuck!

446
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:17,170
麥克 你在哪?
Mac, where are you?

447
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,170
老天!
Jesus.

448
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,210
捉逮到你了 賤人
I got you, mother fucker.

449
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,280
我殺死你
I killed you, you fuck.

450
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:33,020
老天 你殺了一隻豬
Jesus, you killed a pig.

451
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:36,190
你是不是應該找只大點的?
Think you could have found something bigger?

452
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,690
是啊 去你媽的!
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

453
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,190
那女人在那裏?
Where's the girl?

454
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,600
他媽的!
Aw, shit!

455
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:47,110
為什麼沒人看著她?
Why the hell wasn't anybody watching her?

456
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:53,740
她為什麼沒有逃走?
Why didn't she try to get away?

457
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,410
你看她 她嚇壞了!
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

458
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,620
少校 你最好來看看
Major, you better take a look at this.

459
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,930
佈雷的屍體不見了
Blain's body, it's gone.

460
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,050
它避過了我們設下的陷阱
It came in through the tripwires.

461
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,860
在我們面前把佈雷帶走
Took it right out from under our noses.

462
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,180
是那隻豬誤觸陷阱
That boar had to set off a tripflare...

463
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,640
再沒有其它足印
because there ain't no other tracks.

464
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,640
怎麼有人能通過陷阱
How could anyone get through this...

465
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,050
帶走佈雷又不讓我們發覺?
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

466
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,750
我是指他為什麼沒殺人呢?
Why didn't he try and kill one of us?

467
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,160
他來只是拿那屍體
He came to get the body.

468
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,990
他一次只殺一個
He's killing us one at a time.

469
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,860
就像獵人一樣
Like a hunter.

470
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,980
他是利用這些樹潛進來的
He's using the trees.

471
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,790
昨天你看到什麼?
Yesterday, what did you see?

472
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,530
你在浪費你的時間
You're wasting your time.

473
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,000
別再跟我們玩把戲
No more games.

474
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,600
我不知道它是什麼
I don't know what it was. It...

475
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:34,140
繼續
Go on.

476
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,140
它會變顏色
It changed colors

477
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,640
就像變色龍一樣
like the chameleon.

478
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,810
它利用這叢林
It uses the jungle.

479
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,450
你說他們是被蜥蜴殺死的?
Blain and Hawkins were killed by a lizard?

480
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,610
發什麼神經
That's a bullshit psych job.

481
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,550
外面最多只有兩三人在活動
There's 2 or 3 men out there.

482
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,320
去他媽的蜥蜴
Fucking lizard!

483
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,820
你叫什麼名字?
What's your name?

484
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,430
安娜
Anna.

485
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,060
安娜
Anna,

486
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,560
這東西在追捕我們
the thing is hunting us.

487
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,630
所有的人
All of us.

488
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,540
你明白嗎?
You know that.

489
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,970
你以為你在做什麼?
What the hell are you doing?

490
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,040
我們需要這裏的每個人
We'll need everyone.

491
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:13,740
我要帶她回去
l'm taking her back.

492
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,140
我們五分鐘後就要走
We leave in five minutes.

493
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,250
我們還不能走
We're not going yet.

494
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,250
聽著 救援部隊很快便到
Rendezvous is ten miles away.

495
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,750
你以為直升機會等我們嗎?
You think the chopper's going to wait?

496
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,350
狄龍 我們必須共同抵抗敵人
We make a stand now,

497
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,950
否則誰都不能活著出去
or nobody will be left.

498
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,260
還有一件事
There is something else.

499
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,860
那個大個子被殺的時候
When the big man was killed,

500
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:31,090
你一定弄傷了它
you must have wounded it.

501
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,470
它的血滴在樹葉上
Its blood was on the leaves.

502
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:37,070
如果它會流血 那麼我們就能殺掉它
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

503
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,070
小心
Look out.

504
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:30,050
你認為這童子軍玩意有效?
You really think this Boy Scout bullshit's gonna work?

505
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,950
它能看到那些金屬線
It can see tripwires.

506
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,160
但可能看不到這陷阱
Maybe it can't see this.

507
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,660
少廢話了 趕緊幫忙
Instead of complaining, maybe you should help.

508
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,190
怎麼你認為它一定會走這裏
What makes you think he'll come through here?

509
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,790
50碼半徑內的每棵樹上 都綁上了金屬線
The trees have tripwires every 50 yards.

510
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,200
這是剩下的唯一通路
This is the only way in.

511
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,320
當我還是小孩子時
When I was little,

512
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,950
我們找到一個男人
we found a man.

513
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,730
他看起來像被屠宰過
He looked like...like butchered.

514
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,860
村裏的老女人一直畫十字
The old women in the village crossed themselves...

515
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:23,340
祈禱著瘋狂 奇怪的禱詞
and whispered crazy things, such strange things.

516
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,640
魔鬼奉獻

517
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:31,340
只有在最熱的年份 才會發生這種事
Only in the hottest years this happens.

518
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,850
而今年也非常的熱
And this year, it grows hot.

519
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,450
我們開始找到那些男人
We begin finding our men.

520
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,050
有些被剝了皮
We found them sometimes without their skin

521
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,800
有時更可怕
and sometimes much, much worse.

522
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,900
魔鬼奉獻的意思是...

523
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:58,810
魔鬼把男人當作他的戰利品
means "the demon who makes trophies of man."

524
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,090
你下回要用什麼作餌 芝士?
What you gonna try next, cheese?

525
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,330
達奇!
Hey, Dutch. Dutch!

526
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,060
他媽的!
Shit!

527
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:14,110
捉到你了! 捉到了!
I got you, you mother! I got you!

528
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,910
我來追你!
I'm coming!

529
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,310
麥克! 麥克!
Mac! Mac!

530
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,110
帶他到直升機那裏
Get Ramirez to the chopper.

531
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,810
好的
Right.

532
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,410
等一下 達奇
Hold it.

533
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,810
我去追麥克
I'm going after Mac.

534
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,310
不像你的一貫作風 狄龍
That's not your style, Dillon.

535
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,920
我從你這學了些壞習慣
I picked up bad habits from you.

536
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:30,050
你們快走吧!
Get your people the hell out.

537
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,620
你不可能贏的 狄龍
You can't win this, Dillon.

538
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,830
也許我可以報仇
Maybe I can get even.

539
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,220
狄龍!
Dillon.

540
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,240
你只要叫那直升機等我和麥克回來就好了
Just hold onto that damn chopper.

541
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,480
他傷得很重 少校
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

542
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:57,390
我可以捱得住
I can make it. I can make it.

543
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,650
帶走無線電 其它的都不要
Get the radio. Forget the rest.

544
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,080
好的!
Right!

545
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,850
走吧! 賓 我們走吧
Come on, Poncho.

546
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,450
老天
God!

547
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,500
高個子薩麗
"Long tall Sally"

548
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,250
她非常甜美
"she's built sweet!"

549
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,670
她什麼都有
"She got everything that Uncle John need"

550
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,670
寶貝
"Oh, baby"

551
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,380
寶貝
"Baby"

552
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,930
給我點快樂...
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

553
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:47,340
給我點快樂...
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

554
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,620
轉過來
Turn around.

555
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:17,630
我在這裏
Over here.

556
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,160
我在這裏
Over here.

557
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,240
麥克
Mac?

558
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:40,990
噓...
Shh.

559
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:45,150
麥克
Mac?

560
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:50,570
它在那裏 在那些樹上
Out there. Past them trees.

561
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,100
看得見嗎?
You see it?

562
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,870
我看到你了
I see you.

563
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,880
我看到了
I see it.

564
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:17,420
是的 我看到了
Yeah...I see it.

565
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:21,690
現在我們可以殺了它
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.

566
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,390
你慢慢爬過去接近它
You work your way down there toward him.

567
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,700
我在上頭逼近它後面 把它趕去你處
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.

568
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:31,000
當我趕那雜種時
When I flush the son of a bitch,

569
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,400
你就殺了它
you nail him.

570
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,140
我有個血海深仇要報
I got a score to settle.

571
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:38,050
我們都有仇要報
