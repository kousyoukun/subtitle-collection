1
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,780
- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.

2
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,159
Come on inside.

3
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:08,911
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper...
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide

4
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,125
from this charming little country.

5
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:16,207
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.

6
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:22,506
This cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

7
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,678
Apparently, they strayed off course.
We're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

8
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:32,473
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?

9
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,901
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

10
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:45,234
Dillon.

11
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,531
You son of a bitch.

12
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:58,961
What's the matter? The CIA got you
pushing too many pencils?

13
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:05,347
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

14
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:13,312
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

15
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:17,432
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Forget about my tie.

16
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:21,110
I heard about that job you pulled off in Berlin.
Very nice, Dutch.

17
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,949
- Good old days.
- Yeah, like the good old days.

18
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,450
- Then how come you passed on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

19
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,910
You got no style, Dutch. You know that.

20
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,489
Come on. Why'd you pass?

21
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:39,043
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

22
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:43,384
Now, what we gotta do?

23
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:47,136
That cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.

24
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:51,387
A couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.

25
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,937
We need the best. That's why you're here.

26
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,687
- Go on.
- Simple setup. One-day operation.

27
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:04,232
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.

28
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:08,281
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

29
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:15,200
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.

30
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,628
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

31
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:24,299
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.

32
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:34,075
<i>Delta One-Zero to Two Leader.</i>

33
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:37,826
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

34
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:41,497
- AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?

35
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:44,254
No such thing. This is a one-way ticket.

36
00:07:44,337 --> 00:07:47,788
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

37
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,214
This is getting better by the minute.

38
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,065
Billy!

39
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:13,605
Billy! The other day
I went up to my girlfriend. I said,

40
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:16,106
"You know, I'd like a little pussy."

41
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:19,404
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house."

42
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:23,751
You see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...

43
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:28,459
big as a house.

44
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:38,215
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

45
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:43,096
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here.

46
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:46,436
This stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,

47
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:48,314
just like me.

48
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,807
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

49
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:05,575
That was in '72. Me and Dutch both got one.

50
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:30,268
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

51
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,337
<i>You got it, Leader.</i>

52
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,972
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

53
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,632
You never were that smart.

54
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,606
Hawkins, you're up.

55
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,782
<i>Lines away.</i>

56
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:16,410
The pilots have been shot in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

57
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:20,076
- Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
- There's something else, Major.

58
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,287
This is no ordinary army taxi.

59
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:25,707
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

60
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:29,626
- Pick up the trail yet?
- Billy's on it.

61
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:34,756
Heat seeker, Dillon. Pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.

62
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:37,596
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

63
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,803
There were 12 guerrillas.

64
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:43,473
They took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.

65
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,897
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

66
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:52,276
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

67
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,734
Mean anything to you?

68
00:13:56,865 --> 00:14:01,657
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.

69
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:05,997
Get ahead and see what you can find.

70
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,696
What's he got?

71
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,149
Same business. Guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,

72
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:44,159
followed by men with American equipment.

73
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,284
Do you remember Afghanistan?

74
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:49,705
Trying to forget it. Come on.

75
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,126
Holy mother of God.

76
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,984
Jim Hopper.

77
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,480
Mac, cut 'em down.

78
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,243
I knew these men.

79
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:05,464
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?

80
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,715
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

81
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:11,720
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

82
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:15,637
- They shouldn't have been here.
- Somebody sent them.

83
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,307
The guerrillas skinned them?

84
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,937
Why did they skin them?

85
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,524
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

86
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:36,491
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

87
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,200
There was a firefight.

88
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,493
They were shooting in all directions.

89
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,992
I can't believe Hopper
walked into an ambush.

90
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:47,874
I don't believe he did.

91
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:51,215
I can't find a single track.

92
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:55,465
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What about the rest of Hopper's men?

93
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:58,129
There's no sign, sir.

94
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:01,511
They never left here.

95
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,562
It's like they just disappeared.

96
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,071
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.

97
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:16,367
We move, five-metre spread. No sound.

98
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:20,112
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

99
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,950
Payback time.

100
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:01,047
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.
I don't care who you are back in the world.

101
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:06,842
You give our position one more time,
I'll bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.

102
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:09,092
Got that?

103
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,794
Fuck you.

104
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,363
He killed one of the hostages. We move.

105
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,535
Mac, Blain - the nest.

106
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:03,415
Billy, Poncho - the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon - backup.

107
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,957
As soon as they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

108
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,975
One down.

109
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,950
What the hell's he doin'?

110
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:25,433
What the fuck...?

111
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,187
Showtime, kid.

112
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,760
Target's the centre of the palapa.

113
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:31,243
Dutch, on your nine.

114
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:38,178
Get that mother.

115
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,683
Stick around.

116
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,392
Hostages inside.

117
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,658
Knock, knock.

118
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:45,205
I got 'em.

119
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:50,088
Hawkins, call in position and situation.
Get Con Op on the hook.

120
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,168
You got it, Major.

121
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:01,843
Shit.

122
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:05,602
Mac. Any sign of the other hostage?

123
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:11,230
Found the other guy - he's dead, too -
and the gear from the chopper.

124
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:14,607
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

125
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:19,445
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
CIA. Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

126
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:23,866
Other guys they waxed...
were Russian military advisers.

127
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,247
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

128
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,005
Good work, Mac. Clear the area. No traces.

129
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:31,840
Get the men ready to move.

130
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:43,133
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

131
00:28:43,227 --> 00:28:47,308
- You're hit. You're bleedin', man.
- I ain't got time to bleed.

132
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:57,485
You got time to duck?

133
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,487
This is goddamn beautiful.

134
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:14,286
Goddamn jackpot.
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

135
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:17,004
We got those bastards.

136
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,219
- We got 'em.
- I think this is what you're looking for.

137
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:26,636
You set us up. It's all bullshit. All of it.

138
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:30,891
The cabinet minister, the whole business.
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

139
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:34,765
We stopped a major invasion.
In three days they'd have crossed the border.

140
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,359
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

141
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:43,405
- You're pissed about the cover story.
- So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

142
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:48,405
We've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit.

143
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:52,711
- Hopper went in and he disappeared.
- He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive.

144
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:55,464
I had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards.

145
00:29:55,548 --> 00:30:00,044
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

146
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:05,133
What happened to you, Dillon?

147
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:08,094
You used to be somebody I could trust.

148
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,557
I woke up.

149
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:12,971
Why don't you?

150
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:15,057
You're an asset,

151
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,771
an expendable asset,

152
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:21,858
and I used you to get the job done. Got it?

153
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,613
My men are not expendable.

154
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,321
And I don't do this kind of work.

155
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:36,326
Major, we stepped into some real shit here.

156
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,296
We've got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

157
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,506
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

158
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:48,007
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- She goes with us. She's too valuable.

159
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:51,100
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

160
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,427
You're still under orders, Major.

161
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:56,356
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

162
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,232
She's your baggage.
You fall behind and you're on your own.

163
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:14,498
This place is too hot for a pickup. They won't
touch us till we get over the border.

164
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:19,790
Billy. Give me a way out of this hole.
Aerial says we are cut off.

165
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:23,628
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

166
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,289
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

167
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,504
Not much choice.

168
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,681
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

169
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,448
Dillon.

170
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,074
Over here.

171
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,794
- Turn around.
- Why?

172
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,310
Thanks.

173
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,812
Any time.

174
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,152
Billy.

175
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:40,867
The other day
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

176
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,252
I said to her, "Jeez, you've got a big pussy.
Jeez, you've got a big pussy."

177
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,920
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"
I said, "I didn't."

178
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:54,341
See, it was cos of the echo.

179
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,212
Over here.

180
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,557
Turn around.

181
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,808
Turn around. Over here.

182
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,821
Any time.

183
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,539
Any time.

184
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,271
Goddamn.

185
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,984
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

186
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,604
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.

187
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:52,194
I hear you. This shit's somethin'.

188
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:55,702
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

189
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:59,703
Hey, a little taste of home.

190
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,913
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

191
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:18,925
Come on. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now, get up.

192
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,855
Come on, get up. Would you get up?

193
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,241
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

194
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,996
Try it again... please.

195
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:52,606
What's got Billy so spooked?

196
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,734
Can't say, Major.

197
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:57,526
Been acting squirrely all morning.

198
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:01,115
That damn nose of his... it's weird.

199
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:45,028
What is it?

200
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:49,122
Billy...

201
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:54,746
What the hell is wrong with you?

202
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,920
There's something in those trees.

203
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:39,995
Do you see anything?

204
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,167
Up there.

205
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,545
Nothing.

206
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,381
What do you think?

207
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:56,648
I guess it's nothing, Major.

208
00:41:52,536 --> 00:41:53,864
Please.

209
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:55,578
Please.

210
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:09,936
Billy, break left.

211
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:11,937
Mac, right.

212
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:16,442
- What the...? This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

213
00:43:16,534 --> 00:43:19,653
Major... you'd better take a look at this.

214
00:43:19,745 --> 00:43:21,738
Did you find Hawkins?

215
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,456
I...

216
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,748
I can't tell.

217
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:45,312
What in God's name...?

218
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:47,602
I think it's Hawkins.

219
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:52,943
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

220
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:56,989
Ask her what happened.

221
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:20,585
She says the jungle...
it just came alive and took him.

222
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:23,930
Bullshit. That's not what she said.

223
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:27,762
- It doesn't make sense.
- Those sappers have followed us...

224
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:30,558
They've been in front of us. This woman...

225
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:33,017
Hold it.

226
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,652
Hold it. Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

227
00:44:37,738 --> 00:44:40,229
Why didn't she escape?

228
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:45,033
- Hopper.
- What?

229
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:51,203
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

230
00:44:54,713 --> 00:45:00,252
I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern.
Double back. 50 metres. Let's go.

231
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,531
Come on in, you fuckers.

232
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:56,203
Come on in.

233
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,780
Old painless is waitin'.

234
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:30,067
Sergeant.

235
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:37,740
Motherfucker.

236
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:11,082
- What happened?
- I saw it.

237
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,460
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

238
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,016
Blain.

239
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:36,892
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

240
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:42,610
The wound's all fused, cauterised.
What the hell could have done this to a man?

241
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:44,243
Mac.

242
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:47,032
Mac, look at me.

243
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:50,289
- Who did this?
- I don't know, goddamn it.

244
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:53,162
I saw something.

245
00:49:55,964 --> 00:49:58,537
Not a thing. Not a fuckin' trace.

246
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:02,132
No blood, no bodies. We hit nothing.

247
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:13,517
Dillon, better get on the radio.

248
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:17,017
Mac.

249
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:19,442
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:24,654
I want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.

251
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:30,163
- Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.
- I got him.

252
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:38,225
Major, I set up flares, frags and claymores.

253
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:42,140
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

254
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:44,643
Thank you, Sergeant.

255
00:51:45,862 --> 00:51:47,522
Mac.

256
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,944
He was a good soldier.

257
00:51:53,078 --> 00:51:55,154
He was...

258
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:58,240
my friend.

259
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:07,605
Goodbye, bro.

260
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,753
Blazer One, I repeat, extraction necessary.

261
00:54:18,845 --> 00:54:21,300
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

262
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:25,683
<i>Request for extraction denied.</i>
<i>Area is still compromised.</i>

263
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:31,723
<i>Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner</i>
<i>extraction. Priority, out. Next contact 0930.</i>

264
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:34,852
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

265
00:54:34,943 --> 00:54:37,019
Damn bastards.

266
00:54:37,112 --> 00:54:40,113
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in.

267
00:54:40,198 --> 00:54:43,650
We're assets, Dillon. Expendable assets.

268
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:46,365
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

269
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:49,124
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

270
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:55,248
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

271
00:54:58,174 --> 00:55:00,961
Sergeant?

272
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:03,544
Sergeant. Who hit us today?

273
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:06,347
I don't know.

274
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:10,133
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

275
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:12,517
He was there.

276
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,931
Those eyes disappeared.

277
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:17,017
What was that?

278
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,983
Those eyes, they...

279
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,027
they disappeared.

280
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:25,730
I know one thing, Major.
I drew and fired straight at it.

281
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:30,405
Capped off 200 rounds
in the Minigun... Full pack.

282
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:34,577
Nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.

283
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:38,083
Not at that range.

284
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:45,051
Mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.

285
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:51,256
Ask her. Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

286
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:54,306
Go ahead. Ask her.

287
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:07,946
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

288
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:11,699
Billy... you know something. What is it?

289
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:17,415
- I'm scared, Poncho.
- Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

290
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:21,496
There's something out there waiting for us,

291
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:24,629
and it ain't no man.

292
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:35,305
We're all gonna die.

293
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:42,682
He's losing his cool. There's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.

294
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:45,860
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

295
00:56:45,946 --> 00:56:50,073
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper,

296
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:52,565
and now it wants us.

297
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,417
Here we are again, bro,

298
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:02,958
just you and me.

299
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:06,415
Same kind of moon and same kind ofjungle.

300
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:09,509
Real number 10 night, remember?

301
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:14,422
Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

302
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:18,513
Nobody else. Right on top, bro.

303
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:24,105
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.
You know, whoever got you,

304
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:29,565
he'll come back again, and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

305
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:33,320
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

306
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,502
Mac.

307
00:57:57,014 --> 00:57:59,091
- This way.
- Where the hell are you?

308
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,260
Where are you?

309
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,482
Where are you?

310
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:22,081
Mac, where are you?

311
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,118
Jesus.

312
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:27,415
I got you, motherfucker.

313
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:29,958
I killed you, you fuck.

314
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:33,213
Jesus. You killed a pig.

315
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,217
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

316
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:39,220
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

317
00:58:40,765 --> 00:58:44,300
- Where's the girl?
- Shit.

318
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:47,646
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

319
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:54,189
Why didn't she try to get away?

320
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:57,731
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

321
00:58:57,824 --> 00:59:01,276
Major, you better take a look at this.

322
00:59:06,624 --> 00:59:09,828
Blain's body, it's gone.

323
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:12,327
It came in through the tripwires.

324
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:15,873
Took it right out from under our noses.

325
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,811
That boar had to set off the trip flare, Major,
cos there ain't no other tracks.

326
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:38,396
How could anyone get through this
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

327
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:41,738
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

328
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:44,861
He came in to get the body.

329
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:47,194
He's killing us one at a time.

330
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:49,744
Like a hunter.

331
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:09,307
He's using the trees.

332
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:22,024
Yesterday, what did you see?

333
01:00:22,114 --> 01:00:25,613
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

334
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:31,372
I don't know what it was.

335
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:34,324
- It...
- Go on.

336
01:00:34,418 --> 01:00:37,502
It changed colours like the chameleon.

337
01:00:37,587 --> 01:00:40,078
It uses the jungle.

338
01:00:40,173 --> 01:00:43,542
Are you sayin' Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?

339
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:49,388
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two
or three men at the most. Fucking lizard.

340
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:54,229
- What's your name?
- Anna.

341
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:04,520
Anna, this thing is hunting us. All of us.

342
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:07,608
You know that.

343
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,074
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need everyone.

344
01:01:13,164 --> 01:01:16,414
- I'm taking her back. We're out of here.
- We're not going yet.

345
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,750
The rendezvous is 10 miles away.
You think the chopper'll wait?

346
01:01:19,837 --> 01:01:24,831
Dillon, we make a stand now, or there will be
nobody left to go to the chopper.

347
01:01:24,925 --> 01:01:27,381
There is something else.

348
01:01:27,469 --> 01:01:31,337
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

349
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:34,136
Its blood was on the leaves.

350
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:37,143
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

351
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:06,203
Look out.

352
01:02:26,694 --> 01:02:30,358
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

353
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:34,279
It can see our tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

354
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:37,819
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

355
01:03:36,761 --> 01:03:39,335
What makes you think
he'll come in through here?

356
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:44,176
There are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards.
This is the only way in.

357
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:13,201
When I was little, we found a man.

358
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:15,290
He looked like,

359
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:17,459
like, butchered.

360
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:20,173
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

361
01:04:20,262 --> 01:04:23,797
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.

362
01:04:27,853 --> 01:04:31,056
Only in the hottest years this happens.

363
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:36,935
And this year it grows hot.

364
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:40,655
We begin finding our men.

365
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,239
We found them sometimes without their skin,

366
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:47,661
and sometimes much, much worse.

367
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:57,421
<i>"El que hace trofeos de los hombres"</i> means
"the demon who makes trophies of man."

368
01:05:16,776 --> 01:05:19,942
So, what you gonna try next? Cheese?

369
01:05:23,615 --> 01:05:26,023
Hey, Dutch!

370
01:06:34,225 --> 01:06:35,803
Shit.

371
01:07:11,596 --> 01:07:14,086
Got you, motherfucker. I got you.

372
01:07:16,058 --> 01:07:18,134
I'm coming.

373
01:07:18,227 --> 01:07:23,019
Mac. Mac. Get Ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper.

374
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:26,310
- Hold it. I'm going after Mac.
- That's not your style, Dillon.

375
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:30,269
I picked up some bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell outta here.

376
01:07:30,363 --> 01:07:33,068
You can't win this, Dillon.

377
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:36,028
Maybe I can get even.

378
01:07:36,578 --> 01:07:38,570
Dillon.

379
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:46,204
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

380
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:55,794
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

381
01:07:55,889 --> 01:08:00,515
- I can make it. I can make it.
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.

382
01:08:01,019 --> 01:08:03,391
Come on, Poncho.

383
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,910
Long tall Sally

384
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,662
She's built sweet

385
01:08:28,754 --> 01:08:32,087
She got everything that Uncle John need

386
01:08:32,173 --> 01:08:34,083
Oh, baby

387
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:36,790
Baby

388
01:08:36,886 --> 01:08:39,342
I'm gonna have me some fun

389
01:08:39,597 --> 01:08:41,757
I'm gonna have me some fun

390
01:09:09,502 --> 01:09:11,578
Turn around.

391
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,166
Over here.

392
01:09:21,805 --> 01:09:23,881
Over here.

393
01:09:30,188 --> 01:09:32,264
Mac?

394
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,034
Out there. Past them trees.

395
01:09:52,377 --> 01:09:54,334
You see it?

396
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:00,713
I see you.

397
01:10:09,268 --> 01:10:11,344
I see it.

398
01:10:16,275 --> 01:10:18,351
I see it.

399
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:26,317
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.
You work your way down there toward him.

400
01:10:26,785 --> 01:10:32,408
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
When I flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.

401
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:35,334
I got a score to settle.

402
01:10:35,418 --> 01:10:38,918
We've both got scores to settle.

403
01:12:06,924 --> 01:12:09,711
Come on. Quickly. Hurry up.

404
01:12:09,802 --> 01:12:13,930
Don't. Leave it.
It didn't kill you because you weren't armed.

405
01:12:14,014 --> 01:12:16,090
No sport.

406
01:12:47,214 --> 01:12:48,756
Mac.

407
01:12:58,516 --> 01:13:01,268
Any time.

408
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,421
Let's go.

409
01:14:28,937 --> 01:14:31,013
Billy.

410
01:14:31,524 --> 01:14:33,931
Billy, let's go.

411
01:14:59,592 --> 01:15:01,668
Give me the weapon.

412
01:15:57,023 --> 01:15:58,102
No.

413
01:15:58,191 --> 01:16:00,064
Run.

414
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:10,734
Run.

415
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:12,203
Go.

416
01:16:12,287 --> 01:16:15,573
Get to the chopper.

417
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,040
Oh, shit.

418
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,842
He couldn't see me.

419
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:09,626
Bleed, bastard.

420
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:45,210
You're one ugly motherfucker.

421
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:05,990
Bad idea.

422
01:38:03,854 --> 01:38:05,562
Come on.

423
01:38:06,065 --> 01:38:08,520
Come on. Do it.

424
01:38:08,609 --> 01:38:10,685
Do it.

425
01:38:12,112 --> 01:38:13,820
Come on. Come on.

426
01:38:13,906 --> 01:38:16,942
Kill me. I'm here. Kill me.

427
01:38:17,534 --> 01:38:19,443
I'm here. Kill me.

428
01:38:19,536 --> 01:38:22,453
Come on. Kill me. I'm here.

429
01:38:22,539 --> 01:38:25,705
Come on. Do it now. Kill me.

430
01:39:45,744 --> 01:39:48,033
What the hell are you?

431
01:39:51,751 --> 01:39:57,041
What the hell are you?

432
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:13,992
What the...?

433
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,289
My God.
