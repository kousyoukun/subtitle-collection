1
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,600
阿諾·施瓦辛格

2
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,140
鐵 血 戰 士

3
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,180
你看來很精神  達奇
You're looking good, Dutch.

4
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,780
很久不見了  將軍
It's been a long time, General.

5
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,520
進去裡面談吧
Come on inside.

6
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,270
18小時前
Eighteen hours ago,

7
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,620
我們在這小國失去一架直升機
we lost a chopper carrying a cabinet minister

8
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,630
上面載著內閣成員及其助理
and his aide from this charming little country.

9
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,500
收到的訊號顯示  他們的位置大約在這裡
We've got a transponder fix on their position about here.

10
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,900
這位內閣成員...
This cabinet minister...

11
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,900
喜歡亂竄嗎
does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?

12
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,640
是直升機偏離原定航道
Apparently they strayed off course...

13
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,640
他們肯定落入了遊擊隊手中
and we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

14
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,510
為什麼不用正規部隊去營救他們
Why don't you use the regular army?

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,510
而要用我們這些特種部隊
What do you need us for?

16
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,430
因為有笨蛋認為你們是最好的  指定要你們
'Cause some damned fool accused you of being the best.

17
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,640
狄龍!  你這賤人...
Dillon! You son of a bitch!

18
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,340
怎麼了?
What's the matter?

19
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,370
CIA讓你坐太久辦公室嗎?
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils?

20
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,980
夠了嗎?
Had enough?

21
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,050
你可以放輕鬆些的
Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

22
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,050
好吧...好吧...好吧!
OK! OK, OK.

23
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,550
你永遠不知什麼時候該停
You never knew when to quit.

24
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,460
真高興又見到你!
Damn good to see you.

25
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,860
你這條領帶算是什麼?
What's this fucking tie business?

26
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,060
算了  別談我的領帶啦
Come on. Forget about my tie.

27
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,500
我聽說你在柏林的那次任務
I heard about that job you pulled in Berlin.

28
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,760
完美漂亮  達奇
Very nice, Dutch.

29
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,300
就像美好的舊時光
Good old days.

30
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,770
是啊  美好的舊時光
Yeah, I like the good old days.

31
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,500
為什麼你不參加利比亞的那次行動?
Then how come you passed on Libya?

32
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,070
轟炸不是我喜歡的作戰方式
That wasn't my style.

33
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,570
你可沒有特定的作戰方式
You got no style. You know that.

34
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,870
別這樣告訴我
Come on.

35
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
你為什麼不肯參加呢?
Why did you pass?

36
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,310
我們是拯救小組...
We're a rescue team...

37
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,380
而不是暗殺小組
not assassins.

38
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,220
我們這次的任務是什麼?
Now, what do we got to do?

39
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,730
這位內閣成員
The cabinet minister's important

40
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,220
對我們在這地區很重要
to our scope of operations in this part of the world.

41
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,090
達奇  將軍的意思是說...
The general's saying a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed.

42
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,070
我們不能讓他們被害
We can't let that happen.

43
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,100
我們需要最好的小組
We need the best.

44
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,730
這就是你的小組在此的原因
That's why you're here.

45
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,930
繼續說
Go on.

46
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,200
很簡單的行動  一天就能搞定
Simple setup. One-day operation.

47
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,000
我們到直升機那裡尋找遊擊隊的足跡
We pick up their trail at the chopper, grab those hostages,

48
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,710
救出人質  在他們發現之前
and bounce back, and cross the border...

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,310
我們已經越過邊境回來
before anybody knows we were there.

50
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,910
"我們"是什麼意思
What do you mean, "we"?

51
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,850
我跟你們一起行動
I'm going in with you, Dutch.

52
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,120
將軍  你知道我的隊伍一向是單獨行動的
General, my team always works alone. You know that.

53
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,250
抱歉  少校  我們各有各的命令
We all have our orders, Major.

54
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,320
一旦完成任務後
Once you reach your objective...

55
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,730
狄龍將接管這次行動
Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.

56
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,980
目的地已標在地圖上  無線電頻道也已調好
Rendezvous points and radio freqs are indicated and fixed.

57
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,740
每四小時跟指揮部聯絡一次
AWACs contact on four-hour intervals.

58
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,840
誰是我們的支援?
Who's our backup?

59
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,700
沒有支援  老朋友
No such thing, ol' buddy.

60
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,010
這是單程任務
This is a one-way ticket.

61
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,450
我們越過邊界  一切就只能靠自己
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

62
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,320
這任務越聽越有趣
This is getting better by the minute.

63
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,070
比利!  有天我去我女朋友那裡...
Hey, Billy. The other day, I went up to my girlfriend.

64
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,440
我對她說  "我想跟你做愛"
I said, l'd like a little pussy.

65
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,750
她說  "我也是  我的跟房子一樣大"
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house!"

66
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,350
知道嗎  她希望性器小  因為她的...
See, she wanted a littler one 'cause hers was...

67
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,250
跟房子一樣大...
big as a house.

68
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,570
把那噁心的煙草拿遠一點
Get that stinking shit out of my face, will ya?

69
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,500
都是愚蠢的無能弱者
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here!

70
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,920
煙草可令你跟我一樣
This stuff will make you a damn sexual tyrannosaurus

71
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,500
成性超人
just like me.

72
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,780
塞到屁眼裡去吧  佈雷
Yeah? Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

73
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,590
這打火機是72年在北越
That was in '72.

74
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,290
我跟達奇各得一個作獎勵
Me and Dutch both got one.

75
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,040
嚼煙草真的是個很噁心的習慣
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

76
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,040
到了
Right.

77
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,680
你知道我多懷念跟你一起戰鬥
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

78
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,350
你啥時有這麼聰明了
You never were that smart.

79
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,860
霍金斯  去吧!
Hawkins, you're up.

80
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,130
準備好了
Lines away.

81
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,200
直升機是頭部中彈的
The pilots have each got one round in the head.

82
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,510
他們搶走了裡面所有東西
Whoever hit it, stripped the shit out of it.

83
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,730
遊擊隊是用熱導彈把它擊落
Took him out with a heat-seeker.

84
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,670
還有  少校
Something else, Major.

85
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,540
什麼事?
Ehn?

86
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,480
這不是一架普通的直升機
This is no ordinary army taxi.

87
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,350
在我看來更像偵查機
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

88
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,050
找到他們留下的足跡了嗎?
Pick up the trail yet?

89
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,850
比利正在找
Billy's on it.

90
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,750
狄龍  這事越來越複雜
Heat-seeker, Dillon.

91
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,060
遊擊隊怎麼會有熱導彈
That's pretty sophisticated for half-assed mountain boys.

92
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,590
少校
Major

93
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,760
我想他們的裝備越來越好了
I guess they're getting better equipped every day.

94
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,560
原來有12個人
There were 12 guerrillas.

95
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,860
遊擊隊把他們從直升機捉走
They took the two men from the helicopter...

96
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,270
但是  還有別的足跡...
but there's something else.

97
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,100
什麼意思?
What?

98
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,170
有六個穿美國陸軍軍鞋的人
Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

99
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,230
他們是從北方來的
They came in from the north

100
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,580
他們一路追蹤那些遊擊隊
and then they followed the guerrillas.

101
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,380
這事你知道嗎?
Mean anything to you?

102
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,680
可能只是另一組遊擊隊罷了
Probably just another rebel patrol.

103
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,780
他們經常在這一帶出沒
They operate in here all the time.

104
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,720
-你去看看能發現些什麼  -是  長官
-See what you can find. -Yes, sir.

105
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,320
比利找到什麼?
What's he got?

106
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,720
跟以前的一樣
Same business.

107
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,900
遊擊隊捉走了兩個人
Guerrillas hauling two guys in the chopper...

108
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,660
被一些穿美軍裝備的人追蹤
followed by men with American equipment.

109
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,160
還記得上次在阿富汗嗎?
Do you remember Afghanistan?

110
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,330
嘗試把它忘記吧!  來
Trying to forget it. Come on. Let's go.

111
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,220
聖母瑪麗亞...
Holy mother of God.

112
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,050
吉米·霍普
"Jim Hopper."

113
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,460
麥克  將他們放下來
Mac, cut them down.

114
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,860
我認得他是北卡州部隊的
I knew these men. Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.

115
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,670
他們來這裡做什麼?
What the hell were they doing here?

116
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,400
我不知道  達奇
I don't know, Dutch.

117
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,210
這太不人道了!
This is inhuman.

118
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,310
沒有人告訴我這區域有活動
Nobody told me there was an operation in this area.

119
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,110
他們不應該在這裡
They shouldn't have been here.

120
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,180
是有人派他們來的
Well, somebody sent them.

121
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,720
遊擊隊把他們剝皮?
The guerrillas skinned them?

122
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,290
他們為什麼要這樣做?
Why did they skin them?

123
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,590
軍人不應是這樣死法的
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

124
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,030
比利  到底發生什麼事?
What happened here, Billy?

125
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,600
很奇怪  少校
Strange, Major.

126
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,900
這裡曾經發生槍戰
There was a fire fight.

127
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
他們向四面八方盲目射擊
They were shooting in all directions.

128
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,710
我無法想像吉米會走進埋伏
Can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.

129
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,710
我不相信他中了埋伏
I don't believe he did.

130
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,350
我找不到半點痕跡
I can't find a single track.

131
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,010
完全沒有道理
Just doesn't make sense.

132
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,120
霍普其他的隊員呢?
What about the rest of Hopper's men?

133
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,920
沒有他們的蹤跡
There's no sign, sir.

134
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,060
他們根本沒有離開這裡
They never left here.

135
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,330
他們就像突然消失了一樣
Hell, it's like they just disappeared.

136
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,330
繼續追蹤遊擊隊的足跡  我們去救人質
Stick with the guerrilla trail. Let's get the hostages.

137
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,830
出發吧
We move,

138
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,740
每個人隔5公尺  不要作聲!
five-meter spread. No sound.

139
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,250
是時候把武器拿出來了
It's time to let Old Painless out of the bag.

140
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,550
血債血償的時間
Payback time.

141
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,670
你這討厭的傢伙在做什麼?
You're ghostin' us, mother fucker.

142
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,450
我不管你有多重要
I don't care who you are back in the world.

143
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,080
如果你再不小心暴露行蹤
You give our position one more time...

144
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,690
我會神不知鬼不覺的讓你流血
I'll bleed you real quiet

145
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,190
讓你留下來等死
and leave you here.

146
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,260
你聽清楚了嗎?
Got that?

147
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,860
他們殺了一個人質!
He killed one of the hostages.

148
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,960
我們準備進攻
We move.

149
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,920
麥克和佈雷對付機槍堡
Mac, Blain...the nest.

150
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,630
比利和賓對付警衛
Billy, Poncho...the guard.

151
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,360
霍金斯和狄龍作支援
Hawkins, Dillon...backup.

152
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,860
一切佈署好後  我便攻擊他們的燃料庫
Once they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

153
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,440
解決了一個
One down.

154
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,720
他在做什麼?
What the hell's he doing?

155
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,210
搞什麼?
What the fuck?

156
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,450
表演時間到
Show time, kid.

157
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,550
目標是中央那房屋
Target's the center, on the upper level!

158
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,210
小心九點方向!
Dutch, on your nine!

159
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,370
解決那個!
Get that mother!

160
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,390
釘在此處吧
Stick around.

161
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,690
人質在裡面
Hostages are inside!

162
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,000
你好嗎?
Knock knock.

163
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,010
我去追截他們
I got 'em !

164
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,540
霍金斯  通知指揮部我們現在的位置及狀況
Hawkins, call in position and situation.

165
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,110
用無線電跟指揮部聯絡
Get Connor for the hook!

166
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,150
知道  少校!
You got it, Major.

167
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,460
該死
Shit.

168
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,720
麥克
Mac,

169
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,530
找到其他的人質嗎?
any sign of the other hostage?

170
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,730
找到另外一個  也已經死了
Found the other guy. He's dead, too...

171
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,530
還找到從直升機拆下的齒輪
and the kid from the chopper.

172
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,240
如果他們是中美洲人  那我就是中國人了
But if they're Central American, l'm a Goddamn Chinaman.

173
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,370
這樣說那閣員應是CIA
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was CIA.

174
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,240
還有  我們運氣不錯
Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

175
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,840
除了遊擊隊外  還有蘇聯軍事顧問
Other guys we waxed...Russian military advisers.

176
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,850
看來有大規模軍事計畫進行
Something pretty big was gonna happen here.

177
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,150
做得好  麥克
Good work, Mac.

178
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,050
清理一下現場  不要留下蛛絲馬跡
Clear the area. No traces.

179
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,980
叫大家準備離去
Get the men ready to move.

180
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,190
好的
Right.

181
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,460
那雜種待在那裡死也不走開
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

182
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,970
你中了彈  在流血!
You're hit. You're bleeding, man.

183
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,770
我沒時間流血
I ain't got time to bleed.

184
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,510
好吧
Oh...OK.

185
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,380
有時間躲一躲嗎?
You got time to duck?

186
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,930
真他媽漂亮!
This is goddamn beautiful.

187
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,830
中正頭獎!
Goddamn jackpot.

188
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,890
比想像中更多機密!
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

189
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,200
給我們一網打盡
Now we got those bastards.

190
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,700
捉個正著
We got 'em.

191
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,220
我想這才是你要找的東西
I think this is what you're looking for.

192
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,540
你利用我們!
You set us up!

193
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,780
你告訴我的都是廢話  你騙我們!
It's all bullshit! All of it.

194
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,650
什麼內閣成員等等...
The cabinet minister, the whole business.

195
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,500
騙我們來這裡替你賣命
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

196
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,710
我們剛阻止一次大型入侵
We just stopped a major invasion.

197
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,530
他們本來三天內便會侵略
In three days, they'd have crossed the border with the stuff.

198
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,350
為什麼挑我們?
Why us?

199
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
沒其他人能完成這任務
Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

200
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,120
騙你是因為不這樣的話你不會來
You're pissed about the cover story? I needed it to get you in here.

201
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,120
那你告訴霍普什麼樣的故事
What story did you hand Hopper?

202
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,430
我們花了幾個月才找到這裡
Look, we've been looking for this place for months.

203
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,730
那架直升機被擊中時  我的手下在裡面
My men were in that chopper when it got hit!

204
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,570
霍普是要來拯救我的手下
Hopper was supposed to get them.

205
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,460
而他卻不見了
He disappeared.

206
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,530
他沒有失蹤  他是被活活的剝了皮
He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive!

207
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,240
而我的命令就是  送能消滅兇手的人到這裡
My orders were to get somebody to crack these bastards!

208
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,680
所以你編故事騙我們來送死
So you cooked up a story and dropped us in a meat grinder.

209
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,360
你是怎麼了  狄龍?
What happened to you, Dillon?

210
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,050
你以前是個值得信賴的人啊!
You used to be somebody I could trust.

211
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,880
我清醒了
I woke up.

212
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,190
你為什麼不能醒過來?
Why don't you?

213
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,560
你是項資產...
You're an asset...

214
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,260
一項可以犧牲的資產
an expendable asset...

215
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,760
我用你來完成任務
and I used you to get the job done.

216
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,660
明白嗎?
Got it?

217
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,600
我的手下不是可以隨便犧牲的!
My men are not expendable.

218
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,370
我也不做這種事!
And I don't do this kind of work.

219
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,770
少校!  少校!
Major! Major!

220
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,410
我們有麻煩!
We stepped into some real shit here.

221
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,480
空中偵查說到處都是遊擊隊
Air surveillance says we got guerillas all over the place.

222
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,880
就在一兩公里範圍內
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

223
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,620
他們大概多久會到?
How much time?

224
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,880
半個小時內
Half hour, maybe less.

225
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,420
告訴麥克  五分鐘後出發
Tell Mac we move in five.

226
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,490
等一等  她跟我們一起走
Wait. She goes with us.

227
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,320
她非常有價值
She's too valuable.

228
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,590
她一定知道整個部署
She's got the whole of that work.

229
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,520
她一有機會便會洩露我們行蹤
She'll give away our position any chance she gets.

230
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,890
不行!
No deal.

231
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,490
少校  你必須聽我命令
You're still under orders, Major.

232
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,130
你下命令還是由我來?
You wanna make that call or should I?

233
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,300
你自己負責看著她
She's your baggage.

234
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,300
你跟不上的話  便自理
You fall behind, and you're on your own.

235
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,650
直升機在這裡升降太危險
Place is too hot for a pickup.

236
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,220
他們不會在這裡接我們  除非我們越過邊境
They won't touch us till we get over the border.

237
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,820
比利!  哪條路可以離開這裡
Hey, Billy, give me a way out of this hole.

238
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,650
空中偵查說我們被包圍
Aerial says we're cut off.

239
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,320
唯一的出路是那山谷  它會把我們引向東邊
The only way out is that valley that leads east...

240
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,960
那條路非常險峻
but I wouldn't wish that on a broke-dick dog.

241
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,670
我們沒得選擇
Not much choice.

242
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,130
賓  你開路  儘快前進!
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

243
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,050
放開我

244
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,780
還有很長的路要走

245
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,350
你給我乖一點

246
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,150
狄龍
Dillon!

247
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,060
狄龍  過來
Dillon! Over here.

248
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,110
轉身
Turn around.

249
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,310
為什麼?
Why?

250
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,720
謝謝!
Thanks.

251
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,590
好說!
Anytime.

252
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,080
比利!
Billy! Billy!

253
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,500
有天我對女朋友說
The other day, I was going down on my girlfriend...

254
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,180
你的性器很大
and I said to her"Jeez, you got a big pussy.

255
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,810
你的性器很大...
Jeez, you got a big pussy."

256
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,730
她問為什麼要說兩次
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"

257
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,310
我說我沒有說兩次啊!
And I said, "l didn't."

258
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,220
明白嗎?  因為洞太大  有回音...
See, it was because of the echo. It was...

259
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,650
這裡  這裡...
Over here. Over here. Over here.

260
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,660
轉身  轉身
Turn around. Turn around.

261
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,660
轉身  轉身  這裡
Turn around. Turn around. Over here.

262
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,670
好說
Anytime.

263
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,680
好說
Anytime.

264
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,440
他媽的!
Goddamn. Whew.

265
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,480
老兄
Buddy, buddy, buddy.

266
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,680
我以前也去過可怕的叢林  但都比不上這裡
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, but nothing like this.

267
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,950
同意  這地方真是怪異
I hear you. This shit's something.

268
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,550
柬埔寨和這比  都成天堂了
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

269
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,260
喝點這個吧
Que pasa, amigo?

270
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,200
有點家的味道!
A little taste off home.

271
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,000
在這種地方失去自我控制  就麻煩了
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

272
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,110
不要拖延我們  起來
Come on, sweetheart. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now get up.

273
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,080
快起來!
Come on, get up.

274
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,130
你起不起來?
Would you get up?

275
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,490
不用浪費力氣了
Ni lo intentes.

276
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,730
也許你應用皮帶牽著她走
Maybe you better put her on a leash, agent man.

277
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,820
你有膽再一試!
Try it again...please.

278
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,470
別動!
Callate.

279
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,910
比利為什麼這樣緊張害怕?
What's got Billy so spooked?

280
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,210
我也不知道  少校
Can't say, Major.

281
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,620
一早就這樣了
Been acting squirrelly all morning.

282
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,090
他那鼻子是很奇怪的
That damn nose of his...it's weird.

283
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:48,160
是什麼  比利?
What is it? Billy.

284
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,370
你沒問題吧?
What the hell is wrong with you?

285
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,050
那樹上有些東西
There's something in those trees.

286
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,060
你看到上面有什麼?
Do you see anything? Up there ahead.

287
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,020
什麼也看不到
Nothing.

288
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,230
你認為是什麼?
What do you think?

289
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,830
我想可能沒什麼吧  少校
I guess it's nothing, Major.

290
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,560
好了!  別再掙扎了
Please! Please!

291
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,660
比利  搜查左邊!
Billy, break back.

292
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,470
麥克  右邊!
Back right.

293
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,670
這是...
What the...

294
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,670
這不是她的血
This isn't her blood.

295
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,170
你將他怎樣了!
What the hell did you do to him?

296
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,570
少校  你最好來看一看!
Major, you better take a look at this.

297
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,340
你找到霍金斯了嗎?
Did you find Hawkins?

298
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:25,050
我...我也不知道
I...I can't tell.

299
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,700
老天爺!
What in God's name?

300
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,070
我想那是霍金斯的血
I think it's Hawkins.

301
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,070
那他的屍體呢?
Where the hell is his body?

302
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,670
不知所蹤
There's no sign of it.

303
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,820
問她到底發生什麼事
Ask her what happened.

304
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,160
究竟發生什麼事?

305
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,750
你到底看到什麼?

306
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,820
他在哪裡?

307
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,570
我什麼也沒看到

308
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,100
-快說  -我沒看到他去了哪裡

309
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,190
他在哪裡  快說

310
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,080
什麼?

311
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,400
她說這叢林活過來抓走了他
She says the jungle...it just came alive and took him.

312
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,940
放屁!  她不是這樣說的
Bullshit! That's not what she said!

313
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,740
她說的完全沒有道理
What she said doesn't make any sense.

314
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,010
遊擊隊一直在追我們
Those sappers followed us...

315
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,840
亂說  他們在我們前面
Hell, they've been ahead of us!

316
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:29,810
這女人想趕到前面
This woman's been running us right to 'em !

317
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,110
別吵了
Hold it!

318
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,150
好了!
Hold it!

319
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,620
他們怎麼沒拿走他的  無線電或是武器?
Why didn't they take his radio or his weapon?

320
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,320
她為什麼沒逃走?
Why didn't she escape?

321
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,920
霍普!
Hopper.

322
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,460
什麼?
What?

323
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,640
他們像對付霍普一樣對霍金斯
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

324
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,140
搜尋霍金斯的屍體
I want Hawkins' body found.

325
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,340
掃蕩搜索隊形!
Sweep pattern.

326
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,140
往我們來的方向搜索  檢查這50公尺的範圍
Double back. 50 meters.

327
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,950
開始行動
Let's go.

328
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,890
出來吧  你們這些雜種
Come on in, you fuckers.

329
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,590
出來吧
Come on in.

330
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,900
我的武器在等待你們
Old Painless is waiting.

331
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,090
接觸敵人!
Sergeant!

332
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,530
出來吧  王八蛋!
Mother fucker! Fucker!

333
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:20,150
狗娘養的!  你這雜種
Mother fucker! You mother fucker!

334
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,320
發生什麼事?
What happened?

335
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,690
我看到它
I saw it.

336
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,320
你看到什麼?
You saw what?

337
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,430
我看到它
I saw it.

338
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,310
佈雷  身上沒有火藥痕跡
Blain. No powder burns,

339
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,220
沒有碎片
no shrapnel.

340
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,220
他的傷口是燒焦的
The wound's all fused, cauterized.

341
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,050
什麼東西會造成這樣的傷口
What the hell could have done this to a man?

342
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,130
麥克!  麥克  看著我!
Mac. Mac, look at me!

343
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,970
是誰做的?
Who did this?

344
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,730
我一點也不知道
I don't know, goddamn it.

345
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,340
我看到一些...一些東西
I saw s-something.

346
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,570
什麼也找不到
Not a thing,

347
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,140
一點痕跡也沒有
not a fucking trace.

348
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,940
沒有血跡...沒有屍體
No blood, no bodies.

349
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,140
我們什麼也沒打到!
We hit nothing.

350
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,550
狄龍  你最好快跟總部聯絡
Dillon...better get on the radio.

351
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,090
麥克!
Mac.

352
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,260
士官!
Sergeant!

353
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:18,990
是  長官
Yes, sir.

354
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,860
在山脊上佈置個防禦陣地
I want a defensive position above that ridge...

355
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,900
把所有爆炸品都準備好
mined with everything we've got.

356
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,070
把他放好  我們帶他一起走
Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.

357
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,270
我來辦!
I got him.

358
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,790
走吧!
Vamonos.

359
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,040
少校  我已經裝設好照明彈  手榴彈及地雷
Major...I set up flares, frags, and CIAymores.

360
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,970
沒有什麼能不碰到這些東西  進到這陣地來
Nothing's coming near this place without tripping on something.

361
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,880
謝謝你  士官
Thank you, sergeant.

362
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,750
麥克
Mac.

363
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,290
他是個好軍人
He was a good soldier.

364
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:58,500
他是...我的朋友
He was, um...my friend.

365
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,820
再見了  我的兄弟!
Good-bye, bro.

366
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,630
火焰一號  我重複
Blazer one, I repeat,

367
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,230
必須把我們撤離
extraction necessary.

368
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,460
再說一遍  火焰一號
Say again, Blazer one.

369
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,230
再說一遍
Say again.

370
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,470
你的要求不被接受
Request for extraction denied.

371
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,240
你的位置仍舊暴露在敵人的火力網下
Area is still compromised.

372
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,140
請前進到3000位置  我們在那裡接你們
Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner extraction. Priority, out.

373
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,970
下次聯絡時間是9:30
Next contact 0930.

374
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,780
知道了  火焰一號
Roger, Blazer one.

375
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,340
10:30聯絡
10:30 hours.

376
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,450
賤人
Damn bastards.

377
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,850
他們說我們的位置還太遠
They say we're still in too far,

378
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,850
他們不能冒險前來接我們
and they can't risk coming in.

379
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,650
我們是資產  狄龍
We're assets, Dillon.

380
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,350
可以犧牲的資產!
Expendable assets.

381
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,050
CIA就是這樣
It comes with the job.

382
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:45,960
這點我可以接受
I can accept it.

383
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:49,460
胡說  你跟我們一樣生氣
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

384
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,700
直升機不會來這裡就是了
Shitload of good a chopper's gonna do us in here anyhow.

385
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,770
士官
Sergeant?

386
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,870
士官!  士官!
Sergeant! Sergeant!

387
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,970
今天誰攻擊我們?
Who hit us today?

388
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,880
我不知道
I don't know.

389
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,580
我只看到一個有偽裝的東西
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

390
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,680
他在那裡
He was there.

391
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,220
那對眼睛...忽然消失了
Those eyes disappeared.

392
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,320
你說什麼?
What was that?

393
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:20,300
那對眼睛  他們...他們消失不見了
Those eyes, they...they disappeared.

394
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,890
我只知道一件事  少校
I know one thing, Major.

395
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,530
我對準向它射擊
I drew down and fired straight at it.

396
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,900
我射了200輪以上
Capped off 200 rounds in the minigun...

397
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,800
我把所有子彈射光了
Full pack.

398
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,600
但是一點用處也沒有
Nothing...

399
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,740
這世上沒有什麼東西  在那個範圍內
nothing on this earth could have lived.

400
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,450
還能生存的
Not at that range.

401
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:45,150
麥克  你站第一班  然後去休息一會
Mac, you take first watch then you get some rest, OK?

402
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,030
問她看到什麼?  問她霍金斯怎麼了?
Ask her what she saw. Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

403
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,260
問她吧!
Go ahead, ask her.

404
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,080
你看到什麼了

405
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,990
你看到什麼了

406
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:02,280
叢林活過來把他抓走

407
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,770
還是那句話
Same fucking thing.

408
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,340
叢林活過來把他抓走
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

409
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:11,440
比利  你一定知道些什麼  到底是什麼?
Billy, you know something. What is it?

410
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,880
我感到害怕
I'm scared, Poncho.

411
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,480
放屁!  你不怕任何人的
Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

412
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,050
外面有東西在等我們
There's something out there waiting for us...

413
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,990
而且並不是人
and it ain't no man.

414
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,670
我們全都會死
We're all gonna die.

415
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,270
這傢伙已經失去理智
The man's losing it. He's losing his cool.

416
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,470
只不過是有些敵人在附近
Nothing but a couple guys running around....

417
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,100
我們可以應付
and we gotta take 'em.

418
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,380
你還是不明白  狄龍
Still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

419
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,980
不管那是什麼
Whatever it is out there,

420
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,080
它殺了霍普
it killed Hopper...

421
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,580
現在它要殺死我們
and now it wants us.

422
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,820
我們又在一起了
Here we are again, bro...

423
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:02,290
只有你和我
just you and me.

424
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,630
一樣的月亮  一樣的叢林
Same kind of moon, same kind of jungle.

425
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,700
那晚我們喝酒來壯膽
Real number-ten night,

426
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,330
你還記得嗎?
remember?

427
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,030
整個部隊
Whole platoon...

428
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,500
32個人都被剁成肉醬
32 men chopped into meat...

429
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,900
除了你和我
and we walk out, just you and me.

430
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,610
再沒有別人
Nobody else.

431
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,010
我們是最好的戰士
Right on top of them.

432
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,640
這根本不算一回事
Not a scratch. Not a fucking scratch.

433
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,450
你知道不管是誰把你殺死
You know, whoever got you...

434
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,910
他會回來找我們
he'll come back again,

435
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,720
只要他敢回來
and when he does...

436
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:33,220
我會把你的名字刻在他身上
I'm going to cut your name into him.

437
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,140
什麼事?
What the hell is it?

438
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,140
麥克!
Mac!

439
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,310
這邊!
This way!

440
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,600
-你在那裡  麥克?  -在這邊
-Where are you? -Over here!

441
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:01,550
你在那裡?
Where are you?

442
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,650
麥克!
Mac!

443
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,900
麥克!  該死!
Mac! Fuck!

444
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:16,770
麥克  你在哪?
Mac, where are you?

445
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,770
老天!
Jesus.

446
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,810
捉逮到你了  賤人
I got you, mother fucker.

447
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,880
我殺死你
I killed you, you fuck.

448
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:32,620
老天  你殺了一隻豬
Jesus, you killed a pig.

449
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,790
你是不是應該找只大點的?
Think you could have found something bigger?

450
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,290
是啊  去你媽的!
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

451
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,790
那女人在那裡?
Where's the girl?

452
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,200
他媽的!
Aw, shit!

453
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,710
為什麼沒人看著她?
Why the hell wasn't anybody watching her?

454
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:53,340
她為什麼沒有逃走?
Why didn't she try to get away?

455
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:57,010
你看她  她嚇壞了!
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

456
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,220
少校  你最好來看看
Major, you better take a look at this.

457
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,530
佈雷的屍體不見了
Blain's body, it's gone.

458
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,650
它避過了我們設下的陷阱
It came in through the tripwires.

459
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,460
在我們面前把佈雷帶走
Took it right out from under our noses.

460
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,780
是那只豬誤觸陷阱
That boar had to set off a tripflare...

461
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,240
再沒有其它足印
because there ain't no other tracks.

462
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,240
怎麼有人能通過陷阱
How could anyone get through this...

463
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,650
帶走佈雷又不讓我們發覺?
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

464
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,350
我是指他為什麼沒殺人呢?
Why didn't he try and kill one of us?

465
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,760
他來只是拿那屍體
He came to get the body.

466
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,590
他一次只殺一個
He's killing us one at a time.

467
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,460
就像獵人一樣
Like a hunter.

468
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,580
他是利用這些樹潛進來的
He's using the trees.

469
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,390
昨天你看到什麼?
Yesterday, what did you see?

470
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,130
你在浪費你的時間
You're wasting your time.

471
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,600
別再跟我們玩把戲
No more games.

472
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,200
我不知道它是什麼
I don't know what it was. It...

473
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,740
繼續
Go on.

474
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,740
它會變顏色
It changed colors

475
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,240
就像變色龍一樣
like the chameleon.

476
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,410
它利用這叢林
It uses the jungle.

477
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,050
你說他們是被蜥蜴殺死的?
Blain and Hawkins were killed by a lizard?

478
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,210
發什麼神經
That's a bullshit psych job.

479
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,150
外面最多只有兩三人在活動
There's 2 or 3 men out there.

480
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,920
去他媽的蜥蜴
Fucking lizard!

481
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,420
你叫什麼名字?
What's your name?

482
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,030
安娜
Anna.

483
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,660
安娜
Anna,

484
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,160
這東西在追捕我們
the thing is hunting us.

485
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,230
所有的人
All of us.

486
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,140
你明白嗎?
You know that.

487
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,570
你以為你在做什麼?
What the hell are you doing?

488
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,640
我們需要這裡的每個人
We'll need everyone.

489
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:13,340
我要帶她回去
l'm taking her back.

490
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,740
我們五分鐘後就要走
We leave in five minutes.

491
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,850
我們還不能走
We're not going yet.

492
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,850
聽著  救援部隊很快便到
Rendezvous is ten miles away.

493
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,350
你以為直升機會等我們嗎?
You think the chopper's going to wait?

494
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,950
狄龍  我們必須共同抵抗敵人
We make a stand now,

495
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,550
否則誰都不能活著出去
or nobody will be left.

496
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,860
還有一件事
There is something else.

497
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,460
那個大個子被殺的時候
When the big man was killed,

498
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,690
你一定弄傷了它
you must have wounded it.

499
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,070
它的血滴在樹葉上
Its blood was on the leaves.

500
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,670
如果它會流血  那麼我們就能殺掉它
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

501
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,670
小心
Look out.

502
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,650
你認為這童子軍玩意有效?
You really think this Boy Scout bullshit's gonna work?

503
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,550
它能看到那些金屬線
It can see tripwires.

504
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,760
但可能看不到這陷阱
Maybe it can't see this.

505
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:37,260
少廢話了  趕緊幫忙
Instead of complaining, maybe you should help.

506
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,790
怎麼你認為它一定會走這裡
What makes you think he'll come through here?

507
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,390
50碼半徑內的每棵樹上  都綁上了金屬線
The trees have tripwires every 50 yards.

508
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,800
這是剩下的唯一通路
This is the only way in.

509
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,920
當我還是小孩子時
When I was little,

510
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,550
我們找到一個男人
we found a man.

511
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,330
他看起來像被屠宰過
He looked like...like butchered.

512
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,460
村裡的老女人一直畫十字
The old women in the village crossed themselves...

513
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,940
祈禱著瘋狂  奇怪的禱詞
and whispered crazy things, such strange things.

514
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:26,240
魔鬼奉獻

515
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,940
只有在最熱的年份  才會發生這種事
Only in the hottest years this happens.

516
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,450
而今年也非常的熱
And this year, it grows hot.

517
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,050
我們開始找到那些男人
We begin finding our men.

518
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:43,650
有些被剝了皮
We found them sometimes without their skin

519
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,400
有時更可怕
and sometimes much, much worse.

520
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,500
魔鬼奉獻的意思是...

521
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:58,410
魔鬼把男人當作他的戰利品
means "the demon who makes trophies of man."

522
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,690
你下回要用什麼作餌  芝士?
What you gonna try next, cheese?

523
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,930
達奇!
Hey, Dutch. Dutch!

524
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,660
他媽的!
Shit!

525
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:13,710
捉到你了!  捉到了!
I got you, you mother! I got you!

526
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,510
我來追你!
I'm coming!

527
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,910
麥克!  麥克!
Mac! Mac!

528
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,710
帶他到直升機那裡
Get Ramirez to the chopper.

529
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,410
好的
Right.

530
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,010
等一下  達奇
Hold it.

531
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,410
我去追麥克
I'm going after Mac.

532
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,910
不像你的一貫作風  狄龍
That's not your style, Dillon.

533
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,520
我從你這學了些壞習慣
I picked up bad habits from you.

534
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:29,650
你們快走吧!
Get your people the hell out.

535
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,220
你不可能贏的  狄龍
You can't win this, Dillon.

536
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,430
也許我可以報仇
Maybe I can get even.

537
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,820
狄龍!
Dillon.

538
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,840
你只要叫那直升機等我和麥克回來就好了
Just hold onto that damn chopper.

539
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,080
他傷得很重  少校
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

540
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,990
我可以捱得住
I can make it. I can make it.

541
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:59,250
帶走無線電  其它的都不要
Get the radio. Forget the rest.

542
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,680
好的!
Right!

543
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:03,450
走吧!  賓  我們走吧
Come on, Poncho.

544
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,050
老天
God!

545
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,100
高個子薩麗
"Long tall Sally"

546
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,850
她非常甜美
"she's built sweet!"

547
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:31,270
她什麼都有
"She got everything that Uncle John need"

548
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,270
寶貝
"Oh, baby"

549
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,980
寶貝
"Baby"

550
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,530
給我點快樂...
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

551
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:46,940
給我點快樂...
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

552
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,220
轉過來
Turn around.

553
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:17,230
我在這裡
Over here.

554
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,760
我在這裡
Over here.

555
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,840
麥克
Mac?

556
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,590
噓...
Shh.

557
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,750
麥克
Mac?

558
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:50,170
它在那裡  在那些樹上
Out there. Past them trees.

559
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,700
看得見嗎?
You see it?

560
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,470
我看到你了
I see you.

561
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,480
我看到了
I see it.

562
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:17,020
是的  我看到了
Yeah...I see it.

563
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:21,290
現在我們可以殺了它
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.

564
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,990
你慢慢爬過去接近它
You work your way down there toward him.

565
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,300
我在上頭逼近它後面  把它趕去你處
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.

566
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:30,600
當我趕那雜種時
When I flush the son of a bitch,

567
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,000
你就殺了它
you nail him.

568
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,740
我有個血海深仇要報
I got a score to settle.

569
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,650
我們都有仇要報
We've both got scores to settle.
