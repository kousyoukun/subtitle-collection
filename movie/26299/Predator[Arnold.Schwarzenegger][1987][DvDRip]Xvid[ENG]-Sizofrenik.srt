1
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:51,606
- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.

2
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,888
Come on inside.

3
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:58,445
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper...
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide

4
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,569
from this charming little country.

5
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:05,443
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.

6
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:11,484
This cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

7
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:17,403
Apparently, they strayed off course.
We're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

8
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:21,042
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?

9
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,330
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

10
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,281
Dillon!

11
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,443
You son of a bitch!

12
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:46,446
What's the matter? The CIA got you
pushing too many pencils? Huh?

13
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,571
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

14
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,007
OK! OK! OK!

15
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:00,210
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

16
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:04,162
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Forget about my tie, man.

17
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,689
I heard about thatjob you pulled off in Berlin.
Very nice, Dutch.

18
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:10,412
- Good old days.
- Yeah, like the good old days.

19
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:13,769
- Then how come you passed on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

20
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:16,128
You got no style, Dutch. You know that.

21
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,602
Come on. Why'd you pass?

22
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:24,887
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

23
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:29,051
Now, what we gotta do?

24
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:32,649
That cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.

25
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,726
A couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.

26
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,131
We need the best. That's why you're here.

27
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:43,728
- Go on.
- Simple setup. One-day operation.

28
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:49,046
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.

29
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,929
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

30
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:59,565
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.

31
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,853
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

32
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:08,291
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.

41
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,565
Yeah, OK.

54
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,211
Delta One-Zero to Two Leader.

55
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:18,808
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

56
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,329
- AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?

57
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,973
No such thing, old buddy.
This is a one-way ticket.

58
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,363
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

59
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,649
This is getting better by the minute.

67
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:49,728
Hey, Billy.

68
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:53,123
Billy! The other day
I went up to my girlfriend. I said,

69
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:55,522
"You know, I'd like a little pussy."

70
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:58,685
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house!"

71
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,853
You see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...

73
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,369
...big as a house.

76
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,725
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

77
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:21,407
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here!

78
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:24,610
This stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,

79
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:26,411
just like me.

80
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:28,802
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

82
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,966
That was in '72. Me and Dutch both got one.

92
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:06,648
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

96
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,605
Right.

100
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,568
You got it, Leader.

102
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:41,850
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

103
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,401
You never were that smart.

104
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,802
Hawkins, you're up.

105
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,848
Lines away.

106
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:43,533
The pilots have been shot in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

107
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:47,049
- Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
- There's something else, Major.

108
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,169
This is no ordinary army taxi.

109
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:52,450
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

110
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:56,208
- Pick up the trail yet?
- Billy's on it.

111
00:12:56,293 --> 00:13:01,128
Heat seeker, Dillon. Pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.

112
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,852
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

113
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,969
There were 12 guerrillas.

114
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,489
They took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.

115
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:13,732
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

116
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:17,931
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

117
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,248
Mean anything to you?

118
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,929
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.

119
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,091
- Get ahead and see what you can find.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,492
What's he got?

122
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,804
Same business. Guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,

123
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:07,691
followed by men with American equipment.

124
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,729
Do you remember Afghanistan?

125
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:13,010
Trying to forget it. Come on. Let's go.

129
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,811
Holy mother of God.

130
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:04,529
Jim Hopper.

131
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,882
Mac, cut 'em down.

132
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:19,164
I knew these men.

133
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:23,212
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?

134
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,330
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

135
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:29,211
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

136
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:32,968
- They shouldn't have been here.
- Well, somebody sent them.

137
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,365
The guerrillas skinned them?

138
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,887
Why did they skin them?

139
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:45,327
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

140
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:52,968
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

141
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,567
There was a firefight.

142
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:58,725
They were shooting in all directions.

143
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:01,122
I can't believe Hopper
walked into an ambush.

144
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,886
I don't believe he did.

145
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:07,090
I can't find a single track.

146
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:11,166
- Itjust doesn't make sense.
- What about the rest of Hopper's men?

147
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,721
There's no sign, sir.

148
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,964
They never left here.

149
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,850
Hell, it's like they just disappeared.

150
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:27,092
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.

151
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:31,212
We move, five-metre spread. No sound.

152
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:34,804
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

153
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,403
Payback time.

155
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,607
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.
I don't care who you are back in the world.

156
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:17,165
You give our position one more time,
I'll bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.

157
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:19,323
Got that?

161
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:33,482
Fuck you.

165
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:04,121
He killed one of the hostages. We move.

166
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,204
Mac, Blain-the nest.

167
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,966
Billy, Poncho-the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon-backup.

168
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:12,363
As soon as they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

170
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,924
One down.

173
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,363
What the hell's he doin'?

174
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:25,171
What the fuck...?

176
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:37,092
Showtime, kid.

177
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:02,888
Target's the centre of the palapa!

178
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,288
Dutch, on your nine.

179
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:32,483
Get that mother!

180
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,132
Go!

181
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,125
Stick around.

182
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,723
Hostages inside!

183
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,692
Knock, knock.

185
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:36,766
I got 'em!

186
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:41,449
Hawkins, call in position and situation.
Get Con Op on the hook!

187
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,444
You got it, Major.

189
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,723
Shit.

190
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:56,328
Mac! Any sign of the other hostage?

191
00:26:56,413 --> 00:27:01,726
Found the other guy-he's dead, too -
and the gear from the chopper.

192
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:04,964
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

193
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:09,604
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
CIA. Another thing, Major. They were lucky.

194
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:13,845
Other guys they waxed...
were Russian military advisers.

195
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,128
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

196
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:18,773
Good work, Mac. Clear the area. No traces.

197
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:21,492
- Get the men ready to move.
- All right.

198
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:32,323
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

199
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:36,326
- You're hit. You're bleedin', man.
- I ain't got time to bleed.

200
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:39,371
Oh... OK.

201
00:27:43,653 --> 00:27:46,087
You got time to duck?

202
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,762
This is goddamn beautiful.

203
00:27:57,173 --> 00:28:02,201
Goddamn jackpot.
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

204
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:04,807
We got those bastards.

205
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:09,809
- We got 'em.
- I think this is what you're looking for.

206
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:14,045
You set us up! It's all bullshit. All of it.

207
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:18,126
The cabinet minister, the whole business.
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

208
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:21,842
We stopped a major invasion.
In three days they'd have crossed the border.

209
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,289
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

210
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:30,128
- You're pissed about the cover story.
- So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

211
00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:34,923
We've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit!

212
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,052
- Hopper went in and he disappeared.
- He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive!

213
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,693
I had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards!

214
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:46,085
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

215
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,966
What happened to you, Dillon?

216
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,806
You used to be somebody I could trust.

217
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:56,168
I woke up.

218
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:58,483
Why don't you?

219
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:00,484
You're an asset,

220
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,087
an expendable asset,

221
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:07,007
and I used you to get the job done. Got it?

222
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,567
My men are not expendable.

223
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,083
- And I don't do this kind of work.
- Major!

224
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:20,883
- Major, we stepped into some real shit here!
- #Te sientes bien?

225
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:25,649
We've got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

226
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,769
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

227
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:32,085
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- She goes with us. She's too valuable.

228
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:35,051
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

229
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:37,283
You're still under orders, Major.

230
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:40,092
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

231
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,769
She's your baggage.
You fall behind and you're on your own.

232
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:57,492
This place is too hot for a pickup. They won't
touch us till we get over the border.

233
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:02,567
Hey, Billy. Give me a way out of this hole.
Aerial says we are cut off.

234
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:06,248
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

235
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,801
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

236
00:30:10,053 --> 00:30:11,884
Not much choice.

237
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:14,931
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

240
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,847
Dillon!

241
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:36,566
Dillon!

242
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,284
Over here.

243
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:53,402
- Turn around.
- Why?

244
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,406
Thanks.

245
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,764
Any time.

246
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:16,122
Billy! Billy!

247
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,325
The other day
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

248
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:24,531
I said to her, "Jeez, you've got a big pussy.
Jeez, you've got a big pussy."

249
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:28,049
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"
I said, "I didn't."

250
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:33,248
See, it was cos of the echo.

252
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:58,482
Over here. Over here. Over here.

253
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:00,731
Turn around. Turn around.

254
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:04,408
Turn around. Turn around. Over here.

256
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:12,492
Any time.

257
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,567
Any time.

258
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:08,971
Goddamn!

259
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,491
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy!

260
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:16,963
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.

261
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:21,365
I hear you. This shit's somethin'.

262
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,729
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

263
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:28,567
Hey, #qué pasa, amigo? Little taste of home.

264
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:35,482
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

265
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:47,002
Come on, sweetheart.
Stop sandbaggin' it. Now, get up.

266
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:49,812
Come on, get up. Would you get up?

267
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:52,009
#Mierda!

268
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:56,409
Ni lo intentes.

269
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,650
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

270
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:12,965
Try it again... please.

271
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:04,723
#Cállate!

272
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:16,848
What's got Billy so spooked?

273
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,889
Can't say, Major.

274
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:21,567
Been acting squirrely all morning.

275
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:25,009
That damn nose of his... it's weird.

276
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,124
What is it?

277
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,051
Billy...

278
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:16,445
What the hell is wrong with you?

279
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:22,366
There's something in those trees.

280
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,841
Do you see anything?

281
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:01,924
Up there.

282
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,164
Nothing.

283
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,843
What do you think?

284
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:15,813
I guess it's nothing, Major.

287
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:10,687
Please!

288
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,331
Please!

291
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:23,645
Billy, break left.

292
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,564
Mac, right.

293
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:29,885
- What the...? This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

294
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:32,965
Major... you'd better take a look at this.

295
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:34,964
Did you find Hawkins?

296
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:36,611
I...

297
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:38,809
I can't tell.

298
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,573
What in God's name...?

299
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:59,769
I think it's Hawkins.

300
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:04,892
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

301
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,772
Ask her what happened.

302
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,449
#Qué pasó, mujer?

303
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,932
Mujer, #qué pasó?

304
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,844
#Qué fue lo que viste?

305
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,163
- #Quién fue?
- Yo no sé.

306
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:22,528
#Dime, mujer! #Quién fue? #Dime!

307
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:25,650
- La selva se lo llevó.
- #Qué?

308
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:27,610
No estoy segura. No sé.

309
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:31,403
She says the jungle...
itjust came alive and took him.

310
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:34,610
Bullshit! That's not what she said!

311
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:38,285
- It doesn't make sense.
- Those sappers have followed us...

312
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:40,967
They've been in front of us! This woman...

313
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,325
Hold it!

314
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:47,770
Hold it! Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

315
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:50,242
Why didn't she escape?

316
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:54,849
- Hopper.
- What?

317
00:42:56,933 --> 00:43:00,767
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

318
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:09,446
I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern.
Double back. 50 metres. Let's go.

319
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:58,088
Come on in, you fuckers.

320
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:00,650
Come on in.

321
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:03,122
Old painless is waitin'.

322
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:33,128
Sergeant!

323
00:45:38,053 --> 00:45:40,487
Motherfucker!

326
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:10,009
- What happened?
- I saw it.

327
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,288
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

328
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,044
Blain.

329
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:34,762
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

330
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:40,246
The wound's all fused, cauterised.
What the hell could have done this to a man?

331
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,812
Mac.

332
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:44,487
Mac, look at me!

333
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:47,610
- Who did this?
- I don't know, goddamn it.

334
00:47:47,693 --> 00:47:50,366
I saw something.

335
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:55,521
Not a thing. Not a fuckin' trace.

336
00:47:55,613 --> 00:47:58,969
No blood, no bodies. We hit nothing.

337
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,887
Dillon, better get on the radio.

338
00:48:11,253 --> 00:48:13,244
Mac.

339
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:15,570
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.

340
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:20,568
I want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.

341
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:25,852
- Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.
- I got him.

342
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:43,764
Vámonos.

343
00:49:27,453 --> 00:49:31,128
Major, I set up flares, frags and claymores.

344
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:34,883
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

345
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:37,284
Thank you, Sergeant.

346
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:40,045
Mac.

347
00:49:41,453 --> 00:49:44,286
He was a good soldier.

348
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,364
He was, uh...

349
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,324
my friend.

350
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:56,849
Goodbye, bro.

352
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:05,085
Blazer One,
I repeat, extraction necessary.

353
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:07,528
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

354
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:11,731
Request for extraction denied.
Area is still compromised.

355
00:52:11,813 --> 00:52:17,524
Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner
extraction. Priority, out. Next contact 0930.

356
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:20,525
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

357
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:22,604
Damn bastards.

358
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:25,571
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in.

359
00:52:25,653 --> 00:52:28,963
We're assets, Dillon. Expendable assets.

360
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:31,567
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

361
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:34,213
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

362
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:40,087
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

363
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,566
Sergeant? Sergeant!

364
00:52:45,653 --> 00:52:48,042
Sergeant! Who hit us today?

365
00:52:49,093 --> 00:52:50,731
I don't know.

366
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:54,362
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

367
00:52:54,453 --> 00:52:56,648
He was there.

368
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:58,963
Those eyes disappeared.

369
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:00,964
What was that?

370
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,850
Those eyes, they,

371
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:04,810
they disappeared.

372
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:09,321
I know one thing, Major.
I drew and fired straight at it.

373
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:13,804
Capped off 200 rounds
in the Minigun... Full pack.

374
00:53:13,893 --> 00:53:17,806
Nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.

375
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:21,168
Not at that range.

376
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:27,851
Mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.

377
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:33,802
Ask her. Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

378
00:53:34,213 --> 00:53:36,727
Go ahead. Ask her.

379
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,326
#Qué pasó hoy?

380
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:40,722
- #Qué fue lo que viste?
- Te dije lo que sé.

381
00:53:41,253 --> 00:53:44,802
Fue la selva la que se lo llevó.
#Qué más quieres que te diga?

382
00:53:44,893 --> 00:53:49,808
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

383
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,408
Billy... you know something. What is it?

384
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:58,890
- I'm scared, Poncho.
- Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

385
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:02,804
There's something out there waiting for us,

386
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,809
and it ain't no man.

387
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:16,048
We're all gonna die.

388
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:23,123
He's losing his cool. There's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.

389
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:26,171
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

390
00:54:26,253 --> 00:54:30,212
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper,

391
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:32,602
and now it wants us.

392
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,131
Here we are again, bro,

393
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:42,568
just you and me.

394
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:45,884
Same kind of moon and same kind ofjungle.

395
00:54:45,973 --> 00:54:48,851
Real number 10 night, remember?

396
00:54:48,933 --> 00:54:53,563
Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

397
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:57,487
Nobody else. Right on top, bro.

398
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:02,850
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.
You know, whoever got you,

399
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:08,087
he'll come back again, and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

400
00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:11,688
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

402
00:55:29,933 --> 00:55:32,003
Mac!

403
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,404
- This way!
- Where the hell are you?

404
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:38,484
Where are you?

405
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,527
Mac!

407
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:45,406
- Mac!
- What?

408
00:55:45,493 --> 00:55:47,404
Fuck!

409
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:53,083
Where are you?

410
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:58,453
Mac, where are you?

411
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:01,366
Jesus.

412
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:03,569
I got you, motherfucker.

413
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:06,008
I killed you, you fuck.

414
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:09,130
Jesus! You killed a pig.

415
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:12,011
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

416
00:56:12,093 --> 00:56:14,891
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you!

417
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,763
- Where's the girl?
- Ah, shit!

418
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,972
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

419
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:29,247
Why didn't she try to get away?

420
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:32,643
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

421
00:56:32,733 --> 00:56:36,043
Major, you better take a look at this.

422
00:56:41,173 --> 00:56:44,245
Blain's body, it's gone.

423
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,642
It came in through the tripwires.

424
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:50,043
Took it right out from under our noses.

425
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:07,247
That boar had to set off the trip flare, Major,
cos there ain't no other tracks.

426
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:11,645
How could anyone get through this
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

427
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:14,850
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

428
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,845
He came in to get the body.

429
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:20,083
He's killing us one at a time.

430
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:22,528
Like a hunter.

431
00:57:38,173 --> 00:57:41,290
He's using the trees.

432
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,486
Yesterday, what did you see?

433
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:56,929
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

434
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:02,452
I don't know what it was.

435
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:05,283
- It...
- Go on.

436
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:08,331
It changed colours like the chameleon.

437
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:10,802
It uses the jungle.

438
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:14,124
Are you sayin' Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?

439
00:58:14,213 --> 00:58:19,731
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two
or three men at the most. Fucking lizard!

440
00:58:21,813 --> 00:58:24,373
- What's your name?
- Anna.

441
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:34,243
Anna, this thing is hunting us. All of us.

442
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:37,204
You know that.

443
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:42,447
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need everyone.

444
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:45,650
- I'm taking her back. We're out of here.
- We're not going yet.

445
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:48,850
The rendezvous is 10 miles away.
You think the chopper'll wait?

446
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:53,723
Dillon, we make a stand now, or there will be
nobody left to go to the chopper.

447
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:56,168
There is something else.

448
00:58:56,253 --> 00:58:59,962
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

449
00:59:00,053 --> 00:59:02,647
Its blood was on the leaves.

450
00:59:02,733 --> 00:59:05,531
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

451
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:33,401
Look out.

452
00:59:53,053 --> 00:59:56,568
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

453
00:59:56,653 --> 01:00:00,328
It can see our tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

454
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:03,723
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

455
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:02,721
What makes you think
he'll come in through here?

456
01:01:02,813 --> 01:01:07,364
There are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards.
This is the only way in.

457
01:01:32,783 --> 01:01:35,251
When I was little, we found a man.

458
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:37,254
He looked like,

459
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:39,334
like, butchered.

460
01:01:39,423 --> 01:01:41,937
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

461
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:45,413
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.

462
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:47,937
El diablo, cazador de hombres.

463
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:52,375
Only in the hottest years this happens.

464
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:58,014
And this year it grows hot.

465
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:01,581
We begin finding our men.

466
01:02:01,663 --> 01:02:05,019
We found them sometimes
without their skin,

467
01:02:05,103 --> 01:02:08,300
and sometimes much, much worse.

468
01:02:11,903 --> 01:02:17,660
"El que hace trofeos de los hombres" means
"the demon who makes trophies of man."

471
01:02:36,223 --> 01:02:39,260
So, what you gonna try next? Cheese?

472
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:45,092
Hey, Dutch. Dutch!

473
01:03:50,503 --> 01:03:52,016
Shit!

476
01:04:26,343 --> 01:04:28,732
Got you, motherfucker! I got you!

477
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:32,614
I'm coming!

478
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:37,299
Mac. Mac! Get Ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper.

479
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:40,455
- Hold it. I'm going after Mac.
- That's not your style, Dillon.

480
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:44,252
I picked up some bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell outta here.

481
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:46,937
You can't win this, Dillon.

482
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:49,776
Maybe I can get even.

483
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,214
Dillon.

484
01:04:56,303 --> 01:04:59,534
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

487
01:05:06,343 --> 01:05:08,732
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

488
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:13,260
- I can make it. I can make it.
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.

489
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,018
- Oh!
- Come on, Poncho.

491
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,575
"Long tall Sally"

492
01:05:38,663 --> 01:05:40,255
"She's built sweet!"

493
01:05:40,343 --> 01:05:43,540
"She got everything that Uncle John need"

494
01:05:43,623 --> 01:05:45,454
"Oh, baby"

495
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:48,051
"Baby"

496
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:50,498
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

497
01:05:50,743 --> 01:05:52,813
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

498
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,855
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

499
01:05:55,143 --> 01:05:56,781
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

500
01:05:57,023 --> 01:05:59,093
"I'm gonna have me some fun"

501
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:21,414
Turn around.

502
01:06:24,783 --> 01:06:26,774
Over here.

503
01:06:31,223 --> 01:06:33,214
Over here.

504
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:41,254
Mac?

505
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,574
Shh.

506
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:57,337
Out there. Past them trees.

507
01:07:00,543 --> 01:07:02,420
You see it?

508
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:08,538
I see you.

509
01:07:16,743 --> 01:07:18,734
I see it.

510
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:22,374
Yeah...

511
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:25,454
I see it.

512
01:07:27,383 --> 01:07:33,094
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.
You work your way down there toward him.

513
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:38,936
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
When I flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.

514
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:41,742
I got a score to settle.

515
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:45,179
We've both got scores to settle.

516
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,294
Vamos!

517
01:09:04,903 --> 01:09:06,495
Vamos.

518
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:12,256
Come on! Quickly! Hurry up!

519
01:09:12,343 --> 01:09:16,302
Don't! Leave it.
It didn't kill you because you weren't armed.

520
01:09:16,383 --> 01:09:18,374
No sport.

521
01:09:48,223 --> 01:09:49,702
Mac.

522
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:52,334
Mac.

523
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:01,702
Any time.

527
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:16,657
Let's go.

529
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:27,774
Billy!

530
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:30,572
Billy, let's go!

532
01:11:52,663 --> 01:11:54,813
Dame el arma! Dame el arma!

533
01:11:55,183 --> 01:11:57,174
Give me the weapon!

534
01:12:14,743 --> 01:12:16,540
Dame la mano!

536
01:12:50,263 --> 01:12:51,298
No!

537
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:53,180
Run!

538
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,413
Run!

539
01:13:03,503 --> 01:13:04,822
Go!

540
01:13:04,903 --> 01:13:08,054
Get to the chopper!

542
01:13:49,783 --> 01:13:51,660
Oh, shit!

546
01:17:32,783 --> 01:17:34,933
He couldn't see me.

556
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:23,054
Bleed, bastard.

562
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,814
You're one ugly motherfucker.

563
01:32:07,183 --> 01:32:09,743
Bad idea.

567
01:34:02,783 --> 01:34:04,421
Come on.

568
01:34:04,903 --> 01:34:07,258
Come on! Do it!

569
01:34:07,343 --> 01:34:09,334
Do it!

570
01:34:10,703 --> 01:34:12,341
Come on. Come on!

571
01:34:12,423 --> 01:34:15,335
Kill me! I'm here! Kill me!

572
01:34:15,903 --> 01:34:17,734
I'm here! Kill me!

573
01:34:17,823 --> 01:34:20,621
Come on! Kill me! I'm here!

574
01:34:20,703 --> 01:34:23,740
Come on! Do it now! Kill me!

576
01:35:40,503 --> 01:35:42,698
What the hell are you?

577
01:35:46,263 --> 01:35:51,337
What the hell are you?

582
01:36:53,943 --> 01:36:56,173
Get in. Come on. OK!

583
01:36:56,263 --> 01:36:58,538
Did you get it?

584
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:05,138
What the...?

585
01:37:08,023 --> 01:37:10,218
My God!
