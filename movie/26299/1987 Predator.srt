662
00:56:50,064 --> 00:56:51,251
and now it wants us.

663
00:56:57,457 --> 00:56:58,686
-MAC: Here
we are again, Bro...

664
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:01,726
Just you and me.

665
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,151
Same kind of moon,

666
00:57:04,176 --> 00:57:05,422
same kind of jungle.

667
00:57:06,435 --> 00:57:08,227
Real number ten night,
remember?

668
00:57:09,464 --> 00:57:10,766
Whole platoon,

669
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:12,726
32 men chopped into meat,

670
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:14,592
and we walk out,
just you and me...

671
00:57:14,617 --> 00:57:15,935
Nobody else...

672
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:17,554
Right on top, bro...

673
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:21,611
Not a scratch,
not a fuckin' scratch.

674
00:57:21,636 --> 00:57:23,268
You know,
whoever got you...

675
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,650
He'll come back again,
and when he does,

676
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,455
I'm gonna cut your name
right into him.

677
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,580
I'm gonna cut your name
into him...

678
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:36,713
( branch snaps )

679
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,721
( explosions )

680
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:53,345
-What the hell is it?!
-DUTCH: Mac!

681
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,274
( loud squeal )

682
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:57,945
-This way!

683
00:57:57,997 --> 00:57:58,907
-The hell are you?!
Over here!

684
00:57:58,932 --> 00:58:00,226
-DUTCH: Mac!
Where are you?!

685
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:01,144
( thud )

686
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:03,344
-MAC!

687
00:58:03,825 --> 00:58:04,919
( squealing )

688
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:07,093
( grunts )

689
00:58:07,118 --> 00:58:07,948
-DUTCH: Mac!

690
00:58:07,973 --> 00:58:08,901
-Mac!

691
00:58:08,926 --> 00:58:09,747
-MAC: Fucking...!

692
00:58:09,772 --> 00:58:10,997
( squealing, Mac grunting )

693
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:13,375
( men yelling )

694
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:14,803
-Where are you?!

695
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:16,686
-Don't fuck with me...

696
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:17,363
-Mac?

697
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:19,465
( squeal )

698
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:20,211
-Mac!

699
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:20,982
-DUTCH:
Where are you?!

700
00:58:23,725 --> 00:58:24,642
-PONCHO:
Jesus...

701
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:26,665
-Got you, motherfucker...

702
00:58:27,457 --> 00:58:29,355
Killed you...
 you fuck...

703
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:31,029
-PONCHO:
Jesus...

704
00:58:31,054 --> 00:58:32,498
you killed a pig!

705
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:33,969
-DUTCH:
What the...?

706
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:36,372
-PONCHO:
Do you think you could've
found something bigger?

707
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:37,681
-( laughter )
-Yeah, fuck you, Poncho.

708
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:39,088
Fuck you!

709
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:41,637
-DUTCH:
Where's the girl?

710
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:43,437
-DILLON:
Aw, shit...

711
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:46,758
-Why the hell wasn't
anybody watching her?!

712
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:51,687
( gasps )

713
00:58:51,712 --> 00:58:53,274
-Why didn't she try
to get away?!

714
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:55,167
-DUTCH:
Look at her.

715
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:56,836
She's scared
out of her mind.

716
00:58:57,858 --> 00:58:58,717
-BILLY:
Major?

717
00:58:58,742 --> 00:59:00,187
You better take
a look at this.

718
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,710
Blain's body.

719
00:59:07,735 --> 00:59:08,575
It's gone.

720
00:59:09,918 --> 00:59:11,402
-PONCHO:
It came in
through the tripwires.

721
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,144
Took it right out
from under our noses.

722
00:59:21,092 --> 00:59:24,045
( animal calls )

723
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,890
-BILLY: That boar had to
set off a trip flare, Major.

724
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:33,486
Cause there ain't
no other tracks.

725
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:35,462
-PONCHO:
How could anyone
get through this?

726
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,761
Carry out Blain
without us knowing it?

727
00:59:38,351 --> 00:59:40,399
And why didn't he try
and kill one of us?

728
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:43,631
-DUTCH: He came
in to get the body.

729
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,614
He's killing us
one at a time.

730
00:59:47,308 --> 00:59:48,355
-BILLY: Like a hunter.

731
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,598
-He's using the trees...

732
01:00:19,268 --> 01:00:20,185
Yesterday...

733
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:21,633
What did you see?!

734
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:23,313
-DILLON:
You're wasting
your time.

735
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,637
-DUTCH:
No more games!

736
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,220
-I don't know
what it was.

737
01:00:31,979 --> 01:00:32,854
It...

738
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,719
-Go on!

739
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,825
-WOMAN:
It changed colors.

740
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:37,676
Like the chameleon.

741
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:39,042
It uses the jungle...

742
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:41,648
-DILLON:
You sayin' that
Blain and Hawkins

743
01:00:41,673 --> 01:00:43,150
were killed by
a fuckin' LIZARD?!

744
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:45,053
This is a bullshit
psyche job!

745
01:00:45,078 --> 01:00:46,862
There's two or three men
out there at the most!

746
01:00:46,887 --> 01:00:47,847
Fuckin' lizard!

747
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:52,503
-What's your name?

748
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,093
-Anna.

749
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:00,542
-Anna.

750
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:02,466
This thing is
hunting us.

751
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,359
All of us.

752
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,626
You know that.

753
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:08,639
( cuts bonds )

754
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,100
-DILLON:
What the hell do
you think you're doin'?!

755
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:13,091
-DUTCH:
We're gonna
need everyone.

756
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:14,036
-DILLON:
I'm takin' her back!

757
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:15,317
We're outta here
in five minutes!

758
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:16,423
-We're not going yet.

759
01:01:16,448 --> 01:01:18,587
-Look, the rendezvous is 10
to 12 miles away from here,

760
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:19,838
you think the chopper's
gonna wait?

761
01:01:19,863 --> 01:01:20,708
-DUTCH:
Dillon.

762
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:22,184
We make a stand, now.

763
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:24,337
Or there will be nobody
left to go to the chopper.

764
01:01:25,058 --> 01:01:26,407
-ANNA: There is
something else.

765
01:01:27,482 --> 01:01:29,039
When the big man
was killed...

766
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,582
you must have
wounded it.

767
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:33,090
Its blood was
on the leaves.

768
01:01:34,098 --> 01:01:35,186
-DUTCH:
If it bleeds...

769
01:01:35,578 --> 01:01:36,770
We can kill it.

770
01:01:47,257 --> 01:01:48,460
( straining )

771
01:02:04,863 --> 01:02:05,712
-Look out.

772
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,791
-DILLON: Now, you
REALLY think

773
01:02:27,821 --> 01:02:29,626
this boy scout
bullshit's gonna work?

774
01:02:30,404 --> 01:02:32,003
-DUTCH: It can
see our tripwires.

775
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:33,682
Maybe it can't see this.

776
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:35,663
Instead of complaining,

777
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:37,118
maybe you should help.

778
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:38,817
( Dillon scoffs )

779
01:03:36,966 --> 01:03:39,167
-DILLON:
What makes you think
he's gonna come in through here?

780
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:41,980
-DUTCH:
There are tripwires
on every tree for 50 yards.

781
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:43,564
This is the
only way in.

782
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:03,444
( snap )

783
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:12,594
-When I was little,
we found a man...

784
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:14,408
He looked like...

785
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,545
like, butchered.

786
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:20,070
The old women in the village
crossed themselves,

787
01:04:20,095 --> 01:04:21,457
and whispered crazy things,

788
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,797
said strange things...

789
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:25,815
"El diablo, cazador
de hombres."

790
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:30,147
Only in the hottest
years this happens.

791
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,403
And this year,
it grows hot.

792
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:39,719
We begin finding
our men...

793
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:43,442
We found them, sometimes
without their skin...

794
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:46,622
And sometimes,
much much worst...

795
01:04:51,406 --> 01:04:53,838
"El que hace trofeos de
los hombres" means...

796
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:57,050
"The demon who makes
trophies of man."

797
01:05:05,393 --> 01:05:07,064
( rustling )

798
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,583
( birds cawing )

799
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:18,831
-So what are you gonna
try next, cheese?

800
01:05:23,765 --> 01:05:24,885
Hey! Dutch!

801
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:25,874
Dutch!

802
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:33,818

01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:43,760

01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:54,923

you motherfucker!

01:07:12,887 --> 01:07:14,082
I GOT you!

01:07:16,434 --> 01:07:17,554
I'm comin'!

816
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:20,604
MAC!

817
01:07:20,629 --> 01:07:21,590
Get Ramirez
on his feet,

818
01:07:21,615 --> 01:07:22,903
-and get to the chopper!
-BILLY: Right!

819
01:07:23,077 --> 01:07:24,681
-DILLON: Hold it, Dutch,
I'm going after Mac.

820
01:07:24,864 --> 01:07:26,547
-DUTCH: That's not
your style, Dillon.

821
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:27,965
-Guess I picked up some bad
habits from you,

822
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:29,388
now get your people
the hell out of here!

823

-You can't win this, Dillon.
