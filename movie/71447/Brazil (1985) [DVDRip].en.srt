There's no stamp here.

There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

No worry there.

00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,900
You stupid sod!

854
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,400
Dear boy.

855
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,200
What do you think
of your mother now?

856
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,100
lt'll never last.

857
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,800
Excuse me.

858
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,700
Dr. Chapman,
did you say something?

859
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,100
That technique.
l've tried it.

860
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,100
Nice effect,
but highly unstable.

861
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,000
ln six months,
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

862
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,800
Now see here, Chapman.

863
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,000
At least mine don't look like
they've been mugged.

864
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,500
Sam. Sam.

865
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,500
What have you done
with his body?

866
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,000
Sam!

867
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,400
Sam!

868
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,300
What's happened to you?

869
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,700
A little complication.

870
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,700
Dr. Chapman says
it often happens

871
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,000
with delicate skin like mine.

872
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,000
Nothing to worry about.

873
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,900
These bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

874
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,700
There's someone
l want to meet...

875
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,800
l know. l know.

876
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,200
Here we are.

877
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,800
l'm going to leave
you two lovebirds in peace.

878
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,900
Hello, Shirley.

879
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,100
Oh!

880
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,700
My God.

881
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,000
Come on.

882
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,100
You want a drink?

883
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,300
Oh... hello.

884
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,700
Chase those years away.

885
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,000
Listen, Shirley.

886
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,400
Your mother and my mother

887
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,800
seem to have the idea...

888
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,800
Look, l'm very flattered,

889
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,600
and l don't want you to--

890
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,500
Oh, it's all right.

891
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,100
l don't like you, either.

892
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,500
Sam.

893
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,000
Jack.

894
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,400
Excuse me, Shirley.

895
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,000
Oh!

896
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,500
l'm sorry.

897
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,700
Sam!

898
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,200
You remember Allison?

899
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,700
Evening.

900
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,100
Allison, Sam Lowry.
Old friend.

901
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,100
Allison.
Yes, of course.

902
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,500
You look different.

903
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,400
l'm two years older.

904
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,300
And seeing Dr. Jaffe.

905
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,200
She doesn't like me
telling people.

906
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,100
l noticed the difference.

907
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,500
Remember how they stuck out?

908
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,900
What? Oh, yes.
Well, rather.

909
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,300
l always wondered
if they were real.

910
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,900
What, my ears?

911
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,100
Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.

912
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,400
Yes, that's what...

913
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,300
l wondered
if she wore falsies.

914
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,000
Oh, Mr. Helpmann.

915
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,500
False ears.

916
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,100
Mr. Helpmann.

917
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,600
Hello, Jack.

918
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,000
Remember my wife?

919
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,400
Of course. Barbara, right?
How are you?

920
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,300
Actually--

921
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,000
Barbara's very well.
How are you?

922
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,900
Fine, thanks.
Hello, Sam.

923
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,300
lda said you might come.

924
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,200
Would you excuse us?

925
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Of course, of course.

926
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,300
Come on, Allison--
Barbara.

927
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,100
Sam.

928
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,900
l need your help.

929
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
Thanks so much, Sam.

930
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,200
l'm glad to be of help.

931
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,100
lf l can help you...

932
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,600
Actually...

933
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,800
Your father and l
were very close.

934
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,100
Jeremiah was senior to me,

935
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,500
but we were close friends,

936
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,400
especially after the bombing.

937
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,600
l keep his name alive
at the office.

938
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,100
lt's as though
he's there speaking to me.

939
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,000
""'Ere l am...

940
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,500
J.H.""

941
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,700
The ghost in the machine.

942
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,300
He would have wanted me
to help you.

943
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,800
l promised your mother

944
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,700
l'd take you onto the team

945
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,200
at lnformation Retrieval.

946
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,100
But l gather that...

947
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,700
Well, actually,
Mr. Helpmann...

948
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,500
l've changed my mind.

949
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,500
l decided l'd accept the transfer,

950
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,000
if l'm not too late.

951
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Too late?

952
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,000
That's for me to say.

953
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,600
Well, then, l...

954
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,600

01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,700
Don't you want to search me?

960
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,200
No, sir.

961
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,600
Want to see my l.D.?

962
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,100
No need, sir.

963
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,400
l could be anybody.

964
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,300
No, you couldn't, sir.

965
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,400

971
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,100
Mr. Warrenn!

972

Yes. Yes.

You can't borrow any chairs.

Oh, God!
This isn't my suit.

1201
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,700
No, sir.

a report on this.

1203
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,400
Now, then, what is the date today?

Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

Well done, men.

Um, OK. Uh...

1224
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,000
And, um...

Thank you.

This way, please.

Straight through.

1237

We'll just go to my office.

Disgraceful!

1244

Can't you read English?

1245
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,800
You illiterate foreign pig!

1246
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,400
You come over here
from your own filthy country..

1247
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,900
and think you can
mess up our streets!

1248
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,700
Oh, God!

1249
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,600
Stop!

1250
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Well done!
That's it! Let's go!

1251

Keep moving!

1253

1255
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,500
You touched me.
Nobody touches me.

1256
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,800
What are you--

1257
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,900
Please, please.

01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,600
Oh, shit!

You're in terrible danger.

You're an embarrassment.

01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,400
Please drive.

You won't believe this.

1286

l know it'll sound incredible,

1287
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,300
but l've been
dreaming about you.

1288
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,800

01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,000
Anyway, um...

1293
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,200
Y-Y-You--

1294

You don't believe me, do you?

1295
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:56,600
Y-You probably think
l-l-l'm bonkers, right?

1296
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,100
Mad. Raving.

1297
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:03,300
No. l think you're
very attractive.

1298
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
What?

1299
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,200
Yeah. Sit back.

1300
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,800
Let me look at you.

1301
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1302
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,900
Good-looking. Sexy.

l don't believe you.

1304
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,700
Why not?

1305
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:32,700
l-l just don't deserve
such terrific luck.

1306
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,600
You're damn right.

1307
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,600
Aah!

1308
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,500
You don't trust me, do you?

1309
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,400
We shouldn't have come here!

1310
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,200
l got a job to do!

1311
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,400
They'll be lying in wait!

1312
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,000
Christ, you're paranoid.

1313
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,800
No sense of reality.

1314
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,700
Wait, wait, wait!

1315
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,800
We'll take the lorry
and get away!

1316
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,200
Yeah? Where to?

1317
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,600
Anywhere!

1318
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,000
There isn't anywhere!

1319
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,500
Just far away!

1320
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,500
That's not far enough!

1321
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,000
Wait!

1322
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,400
Jill!

1323
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,700
What's in the, uh... parcel?

1324
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,500
Christmas present.

1325
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,100
Oh.

1326
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,200
lt's heavy.

1327
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,700
Heavy Christmas present.

1328
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,100
Oh.

1329
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:48,000
You don't trust me,
open it.

1330
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,500
No, no. lt's fine.

1331
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,400
l'd spoil the wrapping.

1332
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,300
Anyway, if you're to trust me,

1333
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,600
then l should trust you.

1334
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,000
Doesn't it bother you,

1335
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,900
what you do
in lnformation Retrieval?

1336
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,500
What?

1337
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,600
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

1338
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,100
Here's one now.

1339
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,600
How many terrorists
have you met, Sam,

1340
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,100
actual terrorists?

1341
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,700
Actual terrorists?

1342
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,400
Yeah.

1343
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,300
Well, it's...

1344
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,600
lt's only my first day.

1345
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,100
Uh-oh.

1346
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,700
A roadblock.

1347
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,800
What should we do?

1348
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,200
Stay calm.

1349
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,700
Don't slow down!

1350
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,100
Please, do as l say.

1351
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,700
Go straight ahead.

1352
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:01,400
What the fuck are you doing,
you stupid--

1353
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,500
Ooh!

1354
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,800
We did it!

1355
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,700
We broke right through!
