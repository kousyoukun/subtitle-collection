173
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,810
God... how time flies.

174
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,755
Very clear
delineation of picture.

175
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:55,290
Highly mobile.

176
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,326
Next.

177
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,665
I want to report
a wrongful arrest.

178
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,704
You want the Information
Adjustment Department.

179
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,170
I've been there.

180
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:13,209
You have a form
I need to fill out.

181
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,472
Got an arrest receipt?

182
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,842
Yeah.

183
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:19,814
Is it stamped?

184
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,681
Stamped?

185
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,687
There's no stamp here.

186
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,351
You can't have the form

187
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,223
until this is stamped.

188
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,796
Where is that?

189
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,695
Information Adjustments.

190
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,364
Ahem...

191
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,505
It's nothing.

192
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,683
It keeps picking up old films.

193
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,690
Perhaps the machine's
on the blink.

194
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:01,421
There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

195
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,997
Tuttle should've
had ?31 debited,

196
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:05,531
not Buttle!

197
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,032
A mistake!

198
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,398
At least it's not ours.

199
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,494
Isn't it?
Whose then?

200
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:13,005
Information Retrieval.

201
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,541
Expediting is put in

202
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,008
for electrical procedures

203
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:17,510
for Buttle, Archibald,

204
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,045
shoe repair operative.

205
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:20,512
Security has invoiced

206
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,014
for Tuttle, Archibald,

207
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,550
heating engineer.

208
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:25,051
What a relief!

209
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:27,519
Well, finish
your tea, son.

210
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,523
What?
Oh, thanks.

211
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,526
I don't know what I'd do

212
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:35,028
if you ever got promoted.

213
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,530
No worry there.

214
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:39,533
But if they did promote you?

215
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:42,069
I'd turn it down.

216
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,536
Would you, really?

217
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,766
Really.

218
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,333
You've been promoted.

219
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,973
It's your mother, isn't it?

220
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,608
Pulling strings again.

221
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:02,557
It's time for you
to accept responsibility.

222
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,061
Your father
would be appalled

223
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,632
at your lack of promotion.

224
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,099
I wish you'd stop interfering.

225
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:13,568
I don't want promotion.

226
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,730
I'm happy where I am.

227
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,239
No, you're not.

228
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:20,278
Jack Lint's a lesson to you.

229
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:22,813
He doesn't have your brains,

230
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,281
but he's got the ambition.

231
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:28,751
You've got me
and the deputy minister.

232
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,788
Now please,
Mrs. Lowry,

233
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,017
don't get upset.

234
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,990
Please wait in reception.

235
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,620
You're giving her wrinkles.

236
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,631
Just try and relax.

237
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,361
I'll make you
20 years younger.

238
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,767
Dr. Jaffe,
you're a genius.

239
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:48,602
Would you like to be
surgeon general?

240
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,972
I know simply everybody.

241
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:54,639
They won't know you
when I've finished.

242
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:55,613
Mmm.

243
00:17:55,716 --> 00:18:00,119
First, we remove
the excess derma...

244
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:01,483
so...

245
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,614
now the flaccid tissues

246
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:06,750
under the eyes and forehead.

247
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,123
Zip.

248
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,127
Now... I lift...

249
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,669
the wrinkles and worry lines

250
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:19,798
right up into the wig,
into the hairline.

251
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,473
Now the template.

252
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:25,605
Easy.

253
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:27,649
A bit of sticky.

254
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,344
And already
she's twice as beautiful

255
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:32,353
as she was before.

256
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:33,387
Voila!

257
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:35,856
Mr. Helpmann was close to your father.
He was close to me.

258
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,788
Still is.

259
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,727
He'll take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

260
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,499
– Thank you, sir.
– You'll like it there.

261
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,303
You're not listening to me, Mother.

262
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:55,572
[Alarm Blaring]

263
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,748
What the hell is this, lady?

264
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,683
It's a present for my son.
Really!

265
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:05,589
I hope you like it.
It's very exclusive.

266
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:09,091
What is it?

267
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:13,324
Something for an executive.
[Giggles]

268
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,795
– Ahem.
– Ah, Madame Lowry.

269
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,802
You look exquisite today.

270
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,269
Merry Christmas.

271
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,307
Hello, Spiro.
Merry Christmas.

272
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,808
You remember
my son Samuel.

273
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,275
Of course.

274
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,279
We're joining
Mrs. Terrain.

275
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,939
Yes. She's waiting.

276
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,321
I thought we'd talk.

277
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,824
We will.

278
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:41,484
Oh, God!

279
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,961
She's with what's-her-name.

280
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,126
Alma, how are you?

281
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,636
You look wonderful!

282
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,797
Hello, Shirley.

283
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,299
Thank you, Spiro.

284
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:57,176
Salt?

285
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:58,677
Not yet.

286
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,806
Sam...
happy Christmas.

287
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,949
So sorry we're late.

288
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,112
Thanks.

289
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,190
What are you
going to have?

290
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,660
I can't decide between
number one or number two.

291
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:15,662
What do you recommend?

292
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,699
Between you and me,
number two.

293
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,166
Thank you, Spiro.

294
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,669
Shirley, what will you have?

295
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:25,673
Between you and me,
number one.

296
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,675
Madame Lowry?

297
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:30,678
Oh, to hell with the diet.

298
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,180
I'll have a number eight.

299
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,683
A most perceptive choice,
madame.

300
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:36,717
Monsieur?

301
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,185
Steak, please. Rare.

302
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:39,688
Monsieur, quel numero?

303
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,190
I don't know which number.

304
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:43,726
That one there.

305
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,193
That's fine. Mother...

306
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:47,093
Alma, you wicked girl.

307
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,132
You started your treatment.

308
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,325
Number?

309
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:52,265
You noticed.

310
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,700
Say the number!

311
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:56,534
I'll tell you about it.

312
00:20:56,641 --> 00:20:58,199
Number three.

313
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:01,577
Mother, listen!

314
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,079
Numero...

315
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:04,409
huit!

316
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:09,683
Braised veal in wine sauce.

317
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:11,653
Mmm! Mmm!

318
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:13,157
It's too exciting.

319
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,660
I've left Dr. Jaffe
for Dr. Chapman.

320
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:18,162
Numero deux...

321
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:19,663
duck a I'orange.

322
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:20,824
Chapman?

323
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,298
Excusez-moi.

324
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:23,834
The acid man?

325
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,335
Really, Ida!

326
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:28,032
Just because his techniques
are revolutionary.

327
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:31,577
I don't call Dr. Jaffe
«the knife man»

328
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:32,872
Numero un...

329
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,572
crevettes a la mayonnaise.

330
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:35,978
I'm sorry, Alma.

331
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,345
It's all right.

332
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:39,078
Steak...

333
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:41,381
numero trois!

334
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,622
Mesdames...

335
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:45,555
monsieur...

336
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,890
bon... appetit!

337
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,520
– Merci.
– Merci.

338
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:54,725
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderful, subtle shading,

339
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:56,701
such delicate nuances,

340
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,171
like an etching.

341
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,606
And it is quicker.

342
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,405
If it wasn't for this complication...

Look at this.

561
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,268
It's a check.

562
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,770
It's the refund for Tuttle.

563
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:37,965
Tuttle!

564
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:39,439
I mean Buttle.

565

It's been confusion
from the start.

trying to blame us.

Can I see?

570
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:52,988
I've never seen a refund.

571
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,115
I'll bet it's Jeffries.

572
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,361
Yes, he believes people
should pay more

573
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:02,365
for their interrogation.

574
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:05,402
We must get rid of it.

575
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:07,869
Send it to somebody else.

576
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:11,408
Send it to Buttle.
It's his check.

577
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:12,874
I've tried that.

578
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:14,376
Look at this.

579
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:17,880
The census has him down
as dormanted.

580

The computer's
got him down as deleted.

581

Hang on.

582
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:25,220
Information Retrieval
has him inoperative.

583
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:27,519
Security has him
as excised.

584

Adminstration says
he's completed.

585
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,419
He's dead.

586
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,960
Dead?

What happened to the, um...

675
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:16,223
Actually, my coming here
is rather unorthodox,

676
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:20,228
as payments are normally made
through central computer,

677

but as there were
certain difficulties,

we thought that
rather than cause delay,

01:00:41,399 --> 01:00:42,764
Oh, really, Louis.

853
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:46,428
I've been looking
for you everywhere, Ida.

854
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:54,439
Mother, I have to talk
to Mr. Helpmann.

855
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:55,945
You stupid sod!

856
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:57,447
Dear boy.

857
01:00:57,549 --> 01:01:01,280
What do you think
of your mother now?

858
01:01:01,387 --> 01:01:03,446
Lt'll never last.

859
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,189
Excuse me.

860
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:09,193
Dr. Chapman,
did you say something?

861
01:01:09,296 --> 01:01:11,730
That technique.
I've tried it.

862
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:14,800
Nice effect,
but highly unstable.

863
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:18,802
In six months,
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

864
01:01:18,905 --> 01:01:20,805
Now see here, Chapman.

865
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:25,071
At least mine don't look like
they've been mugged.

866
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:26,736
Sam. Sam.

867
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:33,953
What have you done
with his body?

868
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:35,579
Sam!

869
01:01:36,757 --> 01:01:38,122
Sam!

870
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:40,090
What's happened to you?

871
01:01:40,194 --> 01:01:41,593
A little complication.

872
01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:44,597
Dr. Chapman says
it often happens

873
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,066
with delicate skin like mine.

874
01:01:47,169 --> 01:01:49,069
Nothing to worry about.

875
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:53,073
These bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

876
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:56,076
There's someone
I want to meet...

877
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:58,305
I know. I know.

878
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,914
Here we are.

879
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:06,580
I'm going to leave
you two lovebirds in peace.

880
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:09,923
Hello, Shirley.

881
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,254
Oh!

882
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,794
My God.

883
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,260
Come on.

884
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:16,423
You want a drink?

885
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,861
Oh... hello.

886
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,173
Chase those years away.

887
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,639
Listen, Shirley.

888
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:28,143
Your mother and my mother

889
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,645
seem to have the idea...

890
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,682
Look, I'm very flattered,

891
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:35,650
and I don't want you to...

892
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:37,654
Oh, it's all right.

893
01:02:37,756 --> 01:02:40,316
I don't like you, either.

894
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:44,889
Sam.

895
01:02:44,996 --> 01:02:46,554
Jack.

896
01:02:46,664 --> 01:02:48,063
Excuse me, Shirley.

897
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,599
Oh!

898
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:51,226
I'm sorry.

899
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:53,569
Sam!

900
01:02:53,672 --> 01:02:55,105
You remember Allison?

901
01:02:55,207 --> 01:02:56,572
Evening.

902
01:02:56,675 --> 01:02:59,075
Allison, Sam Lowry.
Old friend.

903
01:02:59,178 --> 01:03:01,078
Allison.
Yes, of course.

904
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,613
You look different.

905
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:04,580
I'm two years older.

906
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,583
And seeing Dr. Jaffe.

907
01:03:06,686 --> 01:03:09,587
She doesn't like me
telling people.

908
01:03:09,689 --> 01:03:11,589
I noticed the difference.

909
01:03:11,691 --> 01:03:14,091
Remember how they stuck out?

910
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:16,594
What? Oh, yes.
Well, rather.

911
01:03:16,696 --> 01:03:20,132
I always wondered
if they were real.

912
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:21,825
What, my ears?

913
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:26,104
Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.

914
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,640
Yes, that's what...

915
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:30,609
I wondered
if she wore falsies.

916
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:32,440
Oh, Mr. Helpmann.

917
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:34,037
False ears.

918
01:03:34,148 --> 01:03:35,638
Mr. Helpmann.

919
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,148
Hello, Jack.

920
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:38,651
Remember my wife?

921
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:42,154
Of course. Barbara, right?
How are you?

922
01:03:42,257 --> 01:03:43,155
Actually...

923
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:45,954
Barbara's very well.
How are you?

924
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:47,961
Fine, thanks.
Hello, Sam.

925
01:03:48,063 --> 01:03:50,463
Ida said you might come.

926
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:52,466
Would you excuse us?

927
01:03:52,568 --> 01:03:54,502
Of course, of course.

928
01:03:54,603 --> 01:03:56,628
Come on, Allison...
Barbara.

929
01:03:58,107 --> 01:03:59,631
Sam.

930
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,639
I need your help.

931
01:04:28,272 --> 01:04:30,206
Thanks so much, Sam.

932
01:04:30,308 --> 01:04:33,038
I'm glad to be of help.

933
01:04:33,144 --> 01:04:36,011
If I can help you...

934
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:37,672
Actually...

935
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:44,020
Your father and I
were very close.

936
01:04:44,122 --> 01:04:46,522
Jeremiah was senior to me,

937
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:49,059
but we were close friends,

938
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:51,026
especially after the bombing.

939
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,260
I keep his name alive
at the office.

940
01:04:56,302 --> 01:05:00,033
It's as though
he's there speaking to me.

941
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:02,039
«'Ere I am...

942
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:04,704
J.H»

943
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,040
The ghost in the machine.

944
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:14,712
He would have wanted me
to help you.

945
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:18,487
I promised your mother

946
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:21,527
I'd take you onto the team

947
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,096
at Information Retrieval.

948
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,097
But I gather that...

949
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,794
Well, actually,
Mr. Helpmann...

950
01:05:28,903 --> 01:05:30,768
I've changed my mind.

951
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:33,807
I decided I'd accept the transfer,

952
01:05:33,908 --> 01:05:36,433
if I'm not too late.

953
01:05:37,546 --> 01:05:38,945
Too late?

954
01:05:39,048 --> 01:05:41,608
That's for me to say.

955
01:05:42,918 --> 01:05:44,442
Well, then, I...

956
01:05:47,423 --> 01:05:49,516
Welcome to
Information Retrieval.

957
01:06:23,527 --> 01:06:25,119
My name's Lowry.

958
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:27,721
Sam Lowry.

959
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:31,394
I'm reporting
to Mr. Warrenn.

960
01:06:32,371 --> 01:06:35,568
30th floor, sir.
You're expected.

961
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:42,947
Don't you want to search me?

962
01:06:43,048 --> 01:06:44,447
No, sir.

963
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,916
Want to see my I. D?

964
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,578
No need, sir.

965
01:06:50,023 --> 01:06:51,923
I could be anybody.

966
01:06:52,025 --> 01:06:53,959
No, you couldn't, sir.

967
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,085
This is Information Retrieval.

968
01:06:57,363 --> 01:06:59,422
The lift's arrived, sir.

969
01:08:04,134 --> 01:08:06,159
[Shouting]

970
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:24,421
Yes. No.
I want that by 7:00.

971
01:08:24,522 --> 01:08:26,547
[Shouting]

972
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:49,038
Half as terrorists,
rest as victims.

973
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:50,548
Mr. Warrenn!

974
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,049
Yes. No.

975
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:54,017
My name's Sam Lowry.

976
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,054
Hello, Lowry.
Yes. No.

977
01:08:56,156 --> 01:08:57,521
Cancel that.

978
01:08:57,624 --> 01:08:59,057
OK.

979
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:02,721
Glad to have you aboard.

980
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,229
Yes.

981
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:06,196
Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

982
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,631
These invoices?

983
01:09:07,735 --> 01:09:10,704
Yes. Yes.
You'll like it here.

984
01:09:10,805 --> 01:09:14,502
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding? ...decision makers.

985
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:15,973
No. In triplicate.

986
01:09:16,077 --> 01:09:19,205
I'm expecting big things.
Two copies!

987
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:23,516
Between you and me, Lowry... No!

988
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:26,052
Tell records to get stuffed!

989
01:09:26,154 --> 01:09:28,520
The department
is being upgraded.

990
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,557
Ah!

991
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:32,058
Here we are.

992
01:09:32,161 --> 01:09:36,359
Your very own number
on your very own door.

993
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,730
Behind that door,
your very own office.

994
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:41,736
Congratulations, DZ-015.

995
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:43,738
Welcome to the team.

996
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,001
Yes. No. Cancel that.

997
01:09:46,108 --> 01:09:48,099
Send two copies to Finance.

998
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,544
You can't borrow any chairs.

999
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:27,046
There's only one left now.

1000
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,548
What?

1001
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,049
Oh.

1002
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,385
Sorry.

1003
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:35,415
Who are you?

1004
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,891
My name's Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

1005
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:41,896
Oh, yes. The new boy
from next door.

1006
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,431
My name's Lime.

1007
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:44,898
Harvey Lime.

1008
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,435
Welcome to Expediting.

1009
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:50,405
Could I borrow
your computer console?

1010
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:51,906
What?

1011
01:11:52,009 --> 01:11:53,408
For 10 minutes.

1012
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,946
You're taking my console
into your office?

1013
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:59,413
Yes. For a few minutes.

1014
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:01,450
I'll tell you what.

1015
01:12:01,552 --> 01:12:03,918
Tell me what you want.

1016
01:12:04,022 --> 01:12:06,422
I'll do it for you.

1017
01:12:06,524 --> 01:12:10,460
I'm a bit of a whiz
on that thing.

1018
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:11,961
All right.

1019
01:12:12,063 --> 01:12:13,860
I need some information

1020
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:16,331
on a woman named Layton.

1022
01:12:17,936 --> 01:12:19,301
I see.

1023
01:12:19,404 --> 01:12:21,838
Yes. I know her age

and distinguishing marks,

1025
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:25,843

No. Yes.

Anyway, tidy it up, Lowry.

the Department of Works.

1187
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,905
You've stamped this before.

1188
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:01,916
Why won't you stamp it now?

1189
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:04,452
We've already stamped it.

1190
01:23:13,263 --> 01:23:14,787
No! No!

1191
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:17,757
Up! Up! Up!

1192
01:23:21,772 --> 01:23:23,899
Oh, God!

1193
01:23:24,008 --> 01:23:25,703
Come on!

1194
01:23:29,547 --> 01:23:30,775
Shit!

1195
01:23:46,565 --> 01:23:48,692
Come out of there.

1196
01:23:48,801 --> 01:23:50,928
That's the deputy minister's lift.

1197
01:23:51,037 --> 01:23:53,198
I'm in a hurry.

1198
01:23:53,306 --> 01:23:54,705
Come here, sonny.

1199
01:23:54,807 --> 01:23:57,241
Let's see your I.D. Card.

1200
01:23:57,343 --> 01:23:58,708
My I. D?

1201
01:23:58,811 --> 01:24:02,679
Oh, God!
This isn't my suit.

1202
01:24:02,782 --> 01:24:05,046
My name is Lowry.
Sam Lowry?

1203
01:24:07,254 --> 01:24:08,744
No, sir.

1204
01:24:08,856 --> 01:24:11,723
I'll have to make
a report on this.

1205
01:24:11,825 --> 01:24:14,555
Now, then, what is the date today?

1206
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:16,959
It's...
Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

1207
01:24:17,064 --> 01:24:18,827
Hey, you! Stop!

1208
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:20,058
Come back!

1209
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:23,137
You two, after him!

1210
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:25,206
Right! Yes, sir.

1211
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:44,724
Stop!

1212
01:24:44,827 --> 01:24:46,158
Aim!

1213
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,698
Stop!

1214
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:53,200
Don't sh... Oh!

1215
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:54,360
Halt!

1216
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:06,147
Can't this wait?

1217
01:25:06,183 --> 01:25:07,582
Well done, men.

1218
01:25:07,651 --> 01:25:09,380
Quick thinking.

1219
01:25:09,486 --> 01:25:11,545
Excellent work.

1220
01:25:11,656 --> 01:25:15,057
Um, I'll take
charge of her now.

1221
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:16,387
Good.

1222
01:25:16,494 --> 01:25:17,893
Good man.

1223
01:25:17,995 --> 01:25:20,725
Um, OK. Uh...

1224
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:23,428
It's, uh...

1225
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,764
classified matter.

1226
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,337
And, um...

1227
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:31,568
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation

1228
01:25:31,677 --> 01:25:33,110
in my report.

1229
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:34,907
Great.

1230
01:25:36,348 --> 01:25:39,112
Uh, merry Christmas, Dawson.

1231
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:41,186
Come with me. Please.

1232
01:25:41,286 --> 01:25:42,685
OK. Thanks.

1233
01:25:42,788 --> 01:25:44,119
Well done, men.

1234
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,622
Excellent.
Good turnout.

1235
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:46,749
Nice.

1236
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,452
Thank you.

1237
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,794
This way, please.

1238
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:53,297
Straight through.

1239
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:04,306
We'll just go to my office.

1240
01:26:08,582 --> 01:26:10,015
Just keep moving.

1241
01:26:10,117 --> 01:26:12,312
Hey! Stop!

1242
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:15,518
Come back here!

1243
01:26:15,623 --> 01:26:17,215
Pick these up!

1244
01:26:17,324 --> 01:26:20,623
Come on!
Pick them up!

1245
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:23,163
Disgraceful!

1246
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:25,256
Can't you read English?

1247
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:27,494
You illiterate foreign pig!

1248
01:26:27,602 --> 01:26:30,196
You come over here
from your own filthy country...

1249
01:26:32,807 --> 01:26:34,968
and think you can
mess up our streets!

1250
01:26:35,678 --> 01:26:36,804
Oh, God!

1251
01:26:39,482 --> 01:26:40,915
Stop!

1252
01:26:52,195 --> 01:26:55,221
Well done!
That's it! Let's go!

1253
01:26:59,269 --> 01:27:01,362
What are you doing?

1254
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:03,371
Keep moving!

1255
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:05,839
Get out of my cab.

1256
01:27:05,943 --> 01:27:07,501
What? Just drive!

1257
01:27:09,113 --> 01:27:12,048
You touched me.
Nobody touches me.

1258
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,515
What are you...

1259
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:15,518
Please, please.
Drive on.

1260
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,520
Drive on, will you?

1261
01:27:17,622 --> 01:27:19,522
Move over.
I'll drive.

1262
01:27:19,624 --> 01:27:21,182
Don't touch anything!

1263
01:27:24,964 --> 01:27:26,556
It's OK, Officer.

1264
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:29,532
Got everything under control.
Thank you.

1265
01:27:29,635 --> 01:27:31,034
Oh, shit!

1266
01:27:31,136 --> 01:27:32,398
Listen, please.

1267
01:27:32,504 --> 01:27:33,869
Drive. Trust me.

1268
01:27:33,973 --> 01:27:35,770
You're in terrible danger.

1269
01:27:35,874 --> 01:27:38,069
You're an embarrassment.

1270
01:27:38,177 --> 01:27:40,145
Please drive.
Trust me.

1271
01:27:40,245 --> 01:27:42,713
Drive, and I'll explain everything.

1272
01:27:42,816 --> 01:27:43,874
Please.

1273
01:27:44,851 --> 01:27:47,217
Get out of my cab.

1274
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,753
I'm sorry. L...

1275
01:27:48,855 --> 01:27:51,824
OK! OK!
You asked for it!

1276
01:27:51,925 --> 01:27:54,291
I'm Information Retrieval Officer D...

1277
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,294
D-ZED-105!

1278
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:57,761
I'm arresting you!

1279
01:27:57,864 --> 01:28:02,426
Drive on, or I'll blast
your fucking head off!

1280
01:28:04,538 --> 01:28:05,766
Go!

1281
01:28:25,227 --> 01:28:27,127
I'm sorry about that.

1282
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:30,130
I mean, touching you
without permission.

1283
01:28:30,232 --> 01:28:31,324
But...

1284
01:28:31,433 --> 01:28:33,333
Hello. My name's Lowry.

1285
01:28:33,436 --> 01:28:34,835
Sam Lowry.

1286
01:28:34,937 --> 01:28:37,633
I-I-I've been, uh...

1287
01:28:41,411 --> 01:28:43,311
You won't believe this.

1288
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:45,813
I know it'll sound incredible,

1289
01:28:45,915 --> 01:28:49,783
but I've been
dreaming about you.

1290
01:28:49,887 --> 01:28:51,411
Not like that.

1291
01:28:51,522 --> 01:28:54,184
I mean, I love you.

1292
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:57,283
In my dreams, I love you.

1293
01:28:57,394 --> 01:29:00,295
Extraordinary, isn't it?

1294
01:29:04,802 --> 01:29:07,362
Anyway, um...

1295
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:10,464
Y-Y-You...

1296
01:29:10,575 --> 01:29:14,204
You don't believe me, do you?

1297
01:29:14,312 --> 01:29:19,249
Y-You probably think
I-I-I'm bonkers, right?

1298
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,977
Mad. Raving.

1299
01:29:22,354 --> 01:29:26,313
No. I think you're
very attractive.

1300
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:28,851
What?

1301
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:30,394
Yeah. Sit back.

1302
01:29:30,496 --> 01:29:33,090
Let me look at you.

1303
01:29:41,007 --> 01:29:43,066
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1304
01:29:43,176 --> 01:29:46,703
Good-looking. Sexy.
Just my type.

1305
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:51,242
I don't believe you.

1306
01:29:51,351 --> 01:29:52,841
Why not?

1307
01:29:52,953 --> 01:29:56,946
I-I just don't deserve
such terrific luck.

1308
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:00,155
You're damn right.

1309
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,265
Aah!

1310
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:50,467
You don't trust me, do you?

1311
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,814
We shouldn't have come here!

1312
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,749
I got a job to do!

1313
01:32:29,853 --> 01:32:32,151
They'll be lying in wait!

1314
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:33,688
Christ, you're paranoid.

1315
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,655
No sense of reality.

1316
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:37,556
Wait, wait, wait!

1317
01:32:40,497 --> 01:32:43,898
We'll take the lorry
and get away!

1318
01:32:44,001 --> 01:32:45,400
Yeah? Where to?

1319
01:32:45,503 --> 01:32:46,902
Anywhere!

1320
01:32:47,004 --> 01:32:48,437
There isn't anywhere!

1321
01:32:48,539 --> 01:32:49,904
Just far away!

1322
01:32:50,007 --> 01:32:51,907
That's not far enough!

1323
01:32:52,009 --> 01:32:53,567
Wait!

1324
01:33:08,427 --> 01:33:09,587
Jill!

1325
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:05,251
What's in the, uh... parcel?

1326
01:34:05,353 --> 01:34:07,048
Christmas present.

1327
01:34:07,155 --> 01:34:08,713
Oh.

1328
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:17,230
It's heavy.

1329
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,732
Heavy Christmas present.

1330
01:34:18,834 --> 01:34:20,267
Oh.

1331
01:34:20,369 --> 01:34:23,270
You don't trust me,
open it.

1332
01:34:23,372 --> 01:34:25,738
No, no. It's fine.

1333
01:34:25,842 --> 01:34:27,742
I'd spoil the wrapping.

1334
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:30,779
Anyway, if you're to trust me,

1335
01:34:30,881 --> 01:34:33,281
then I should trust you.

1336
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,990
Doesn't it bother you,

1337
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,960
what you do
in Information Retrieval?

1338
01:34:45,062 --> 01:34:46,654
What?

1339
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:49,790
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

1340
01:34:50,802 --> 01:34:52,497
Here's one now.

1341
01:34:53,704 --> 01:34:57,162
How many terrorists
have you met, Sam,

1342
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:58,799
actual terrorists?

1343
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:02,508
Actual terrorists?

1344
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:04,206
Yeah.

1345
01:35:05,918 --> 01:35:07,317
Well, it's...

1346
01:35:07,419 --> 01:35:09,751
It's only my first day.

1347
01:35:21,868 --> 01:35:22,766
Uh-oh.

1348
01:35:22,969 --> 01:35:24,436
A roadblock.

1349
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,740
What should we do?

1350
01:35:28,842 --> 01:35:30,241
Stay calm.

1351
01:35:30,343 --> 01:35:31,742
Don't slow down!

1352
01:35:31,846 --> 01:35:34,246
Please, do as I say.

1353
01:35:34,348 --> 01:35:35,906
Go straight ahead.

1354
01:35:36,016 --> 01:35:39,713
What the fuck are you doing,
you stupid...

1355
01:35:44,525 --> 01:35:46,152
Ooh!

1356
01:35:51,299 --> 01:35:52,732
We did it!

1357
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:54,699
We broke right through!

1358
01:35:54,803 --> 01:35:57,931
We did it! Oowee!

1359

[Police Siren]

1360
01:36:03,178 --> 01:36:04,236
Faster!

1361
01:36:04,346 --> 01:36:06,109
Get off me!

1362
01:36:09,018 --> 01:36:11,919
Keep going. Faster!

1363
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:13,318
Jump it!

1364
01:36:13,422 --> 01:36:15,481
Stay off of me!

1365
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:25,331
No!

Go faster. Faster!

1368

We'll lose the house!

1369
01:36:58,637 --> 01:37:00,195
Don't touch anything!

1370
01:37:01,407 --> 01:37:02,931
Don't touch it!

1371
01:37:24,564 --> 01:37:27,465
We did it!
We did it!

1372
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:30,593
We did it!
We did it!

1373
01:37:36,243 --> 01:37:37,801
Oh, no.

1374
01:37:51,927 --> 01:37:55,363
And what would you like
for Christmas?

1375
01:37:55,464 --> 01:37:57,489
My own credit card.

1376
01:38:02,305 --> 01:38:03,829
Hmm.

1377
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,210
Why are we here?

1378
01:38:09,312 --> 01:38:10,643
Go away!

1379
01:38:10,747 --> 01:38:13,648
Let's go back to my flat.

1380
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,684
You don't trust me?

1381
01:38:15,785 --> 01:38:17,685
You hijack my truck,

1382
01:38:17,787 --> 01:38:19,652
lose me my job...

1383
01:38:19,757 --> 01:38:22,157
Of course I trust you.

1384
01:38:22,259 --> 01:38:24,159
I was only helping.

1385
01:38:24,261 --> 01:38:26,126
I don't trust you.

1386
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,130
What's in that parcel?

1387
01:38:28,232 --> 01:38:31,133
You saved it.
Must be special.

1388
01:38:31,235 --> 01:38:34,136
I saved you.
You're not special.

1389
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:35,637
I'm opening it.

1390
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,071
Don't touch that!

1391
01:38:37,175 --> 01:38:38,733
Ooh! Ah!

1392

Sam!

1393
01:38:48,286 --> 01:38:49,719
It's me!

And Shirley!

Mrs. Terrain.

1396
01:38:59,365 --> 01:39:01,196
That should hold it!

1397
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:02,392
Sam.

1398
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:04,059
Hello, Shirley.

1399
01:39:05,638 --> 01:39:07,868
Oh, my God.

1400
01:39:07,973 --> 01:39:10,441
Whatever's happened to you now?

1401
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:13,138
My complication had a complication.

But Dr. Chapman says
I'll soon be bounding about

What?

1406
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:28,257
Oh, um, yes,
a little something.

1407
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:32,093
Shirley and I
come here regularly.

1408
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:35,159
We love romantic lingerie.

1409
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:36,566
Really? Oh.

1410
01:39:37,572 --> 01:39:38,869

1411
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,998
picture me in these.

Oh, my God.

01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:50,510
Sam, where are you going?

1414
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:51,984
Sam!

Are you all right?

1417
01:40:32,196 --> 01:40:34,096
You don't deserve to be.

1418
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:36,633
What a bloody stupid thing!

1419
01:40:36,735 --> 01:40:38,259
How could you?

1420
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,668
Look at these people.

1421
01:40:40,772 --> 01:40:42,740
It was a bomb!

1422
01:40:42,841 --> 01:40:44,775
I should've opened it.

1423
01:40:44,876 --> 01:40:47,777
It was right next to me.

1424
01:40:47,879 --> 01:40:50,473
There's your bomb, asshole!

1425
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,119
A bribe.

1426
01:40:56,222 --> 01:40:58,747
For official monkeys like you.

1427
01:40:58,858 --> 01:41:00,450
Oh, God.

1428
01:41:02,161 --> 01:41:04,026
Make yourself useful.

Don't touch her!
She's hurt!

1432
01:41:21,381 --> 01:41:22,678
Damn it!

1433
01:41:22,749 --> 01:41:24,182
Don't touch her!

1434
01:41:24,285 --> 01:41:25,809
Don't!

1435
01:41:28,623 --> 01:41:29,715
Stop!

1436
01:41:37,732 --> 01:41:39,063
Sam, no!

1437
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:40,725
Sam, behind you!

1438
01:41:51,614 --> 01:41:55,482
These helmets make
your scalp itch.

1439
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,983
Don't mention it.

1440
01:41:57,087 --> 01:41:59,521
And they make you sweat.

1441
01:41:59,623 --> 01:42:02,387
I can't see where I'm going

1442
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:06,292
for all the perspiration
coming down.

1443
01:42:06,396 --> 01:42:07,693
Well, I'm lucky.

1444
01:42:07,797 --> 01:42:09,662
I got thick eyebrows.

1445
01:42:09,766 --> 01:42:13,862
That channels it
out to the ears.

1446
01:42:13,971 --> 01:42:15,199
Jill!

1447
01:42:15,306 --> 01:42:16,705
Who's he?

1448
01:42:16,807 --> 01:42:18,900
Somebody from
Information Retrieval.

1449
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:21,069
They frequent lingerie.

1450
01:42:21,178 --> 01:42:23,476
Where is she?

1451
01:42:25,116 --> 01:42:27,107
Jill, is that you?

1452
01:42:27,218 --> 01:42:28,617
Excuse me, sir.

1453
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,415
That is government property.

1454
01:42:32,824 --> 01:42:34,382
Jill.

1455
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,790
Jill. Answer me.

1456
01:42:39,097 --> 01:42:41,497
I'm looking for a girl...

1457
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,501
blonde hair,
medium height, green eyes.

1458
01:42:44,603 --> 01:42:48,039
They check all that at the depot.

1459
01:42:48,141 --> 01:42:50,041
We can't allow that.

1460
01:42:50,143 --> 01:42:53,010
It's more than our job's worth.

1461
01:42:53,112 --> 01:42:55,546
Jill, you must be here.

1462
01:42:55,648 --> 01:42:58,014
You can complete an application

1463
01:42:58,117 --> 01:43:00,017
if you're a relative.

1464
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:01,518
Now, stop, sir.

1465
01:43:01,621 --> 01:43:03,020
Jill! Jill.

1466
01:43:03,122 --> 01:43:05,022
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

1467
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:06,683
No!

1468
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:10,931
Sorry about that, sir.

1469
01:43:11,699 --> 01:43:13,166
Regulations.

1470
01:43:20,407 --> 01:43:24,104
I don't care
how you behaved at Records.

1471
01:43:24,212 --> 01:43:26,942
Information Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1472
01:43:27,048 --> 01:43:29,073
We're proud of our reputation.

1473
01:43:29,184 --> 01:43:31,152
We protect it.
Damn it, Lowry!

1474
01:43:31,252 --> 01:43:35,086
Those personnel carriers
are still unaccounted for.

1475
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:36,919
And what's this mess?

1476
01:43:37,025 --> 01:43:40,392
An empty desk
is an efficient desk.

1477
01:43:40,496 --> 01:43:41,861
Queries from security.

1478
01:43:41,964 --> 01:43:43,898
Searches from Central Banking.

1479
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,934
Clarification notices
from Accounting

1480
01:43:46,035 --> 01:43:47,468
concerning unreturned receipts.

1481
01:43:47,570 --> 01:43:49,162
I have to...

1482
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:50,670
Shut up!

1483
01:43:50,773 --> 01:43:53,640
I don't know what's going on,

1484
01:43:53,743 --> 01:43:56,644
but don't think
you'll intimidate us

1485
01:43:56,747 --> 01:44:00,183
with friends and relatives
in high places.

1486
01:44:00,283 --> 01:44:01,682
Now, shape up!

1487
01:44:01,785 --> 01:44:04,253
Mr. Warrenn, what about this?

1488
01:44:04,354 --> 01:44:05,480
Lime...

1489
01:44:05,589 --> 01:44:08,353
I have to use your computer.

1490
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:11,484
Sorry. Bit busy at the moment.

1491
01:44:11,596 --> 01:44:13,655
You seem busy, too.

1492
01:44:21,139 --> 01:44:22,470
Shit!

1493
01:44:22,573 --> 01:44:25,064
Of course you can check

1494
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:28,043
to see if she's been arrested.

1495
01:44:28,147 --> 01:44:32,550
I'm afraid this case
has become much more complicated

1496
01:44:32,651 --> 01:44:34,585
since last we... talked.

1497
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:36,085
But she's innocent.

1498
01:44:36,188 --> 01:44:41,592
Tell the wives of the security men
she blew up today.

1499
01:44:41,693 --> 01:44:43,092
She's not alone.

1500
01:44:43,195 --> 01:44:46,062
Tuttle's just wrecked
an entire flat

1501
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:48,031
and sabotaged
Central Services.

1502
01:44:48,134 --> 01:44:50,602
It looks like your block.

1503
01:44:50,703 --> 01:44:53,433
You should keep
your eyes open.

1504
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:54,632
Bye.

1505
01:44:54,741 --> 01:44:59,110
You don't think Tuttle
and Jill are in league?

1506
01:44:59,212 --> 01:45:00,338
I do.

1507
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,573
Everything's connected.

1508
01:45:02,683 --> 01:45:05,015
Cause and effect.
That's the beauty of it.

1509
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,917
We trace the connections
and reveal them.

1510
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:11,925
This Buttle-Tuttle confusion

1511
01:45:12,026 --> 01:45:13,926
was obviously planned
from the inside.

1512
01:45:14,028 --> 01:45:15,427
Bye-bye.

1513
01:45:15,529 --> 01:45:16,962
Oh, but, Jack!

1514
01:45:17,064 --> 01:45:18,622
She's innocent, Jack.

1515
01:45:18,733 --> 01:45:22,931
Sam, we've always
been close, haven't we?

1516
01:45:23,038 --> 01:45:24,266
Yes, Jack.

1517
01:45:24,372 --> 01:45:27,273
Well, until this
all blows over,

1518
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:29,775
just stay away from me.

1519
01:45:29,878 --> 01:45:31,277
But...

1520
01:46:23,468 --> 01:46:25,095
Aah!

1521
01:47:34,544 --> 01:47:36,535
Oh, my God!

1522
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:38,979

I ought to tell you.

1686
02:04:11,165 --> 02:04:14,498
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

1687
02:04:17,538 --> 02:04:19,506
Thrown in the towel.

1688
02:04:20,842 --> 02:04:22,537
Dead?

1689
02:04:22,678 --> 02:04:24,077
Yes.

1690
02:04:25,113 --> 02:04:27,877
It's all a bit confusing,
but it seems she was killed

1692
02:04:33,088 --> 02:04:34,521
No.

1693
02:04:34,656 --> 02:04:37,454
They're right.
I did that.

1694
02:04:40,463 --> 02:04:43,159
The odd thing is,
it appears to have happened twice.

1695
02:04:43,266 --> 02:04:45,791
Bit of a disputed call,
I'm afraid.

1696
02:04:48,671 --> 02:04:50,434
Twice?

1697

There you are.

1698
02:04:52,376 --> 02:04:55,402
All I can say is,
don't fall at the last fence.

1699

See you in the paddock.

Do cooperate.

Good luck.
