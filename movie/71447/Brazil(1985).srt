<i>Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts.</i>

4
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,322
<i>Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,</i>

5
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>out-of-date?</i>

6
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>Central Services' new duct designs</i>

11
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,034
<i>We have with us</i>
<i>from the Ministry of Information</i>

12
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,912
<i>Deputy Minister, Eugene Helpmann.</i>

13
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>Good evening, David.</i>

14
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:07,502
<i>What do you believe is behind</i>
<i>this recent increase in terrorist bombings?</i>

15
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>Bad sportsmanship.</i>

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,006
<i>A ruthless minority of people</i>

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,968
<i>seems to have forgotten</i>
<i>certain good old-fashioned virtues.</i>

18
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,680
<i>They just can't stand seeing</i>
<i>the other fellow win.</i>

19
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,308
<i>If these people would just play the game</i>

20
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,393
<i>they'd get a lot more out of life.</i>

21
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,396
<i>Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>there are those who maintain</i>

22
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>that the Ministry of Information</i>
<i>has become too large and unwieldy.</i>

23
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,986
<i>In free society,</i>
<i>information is the name of the game.</i>

24
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>You can't win the game</i>
<i>if you're a man short.</i>

25
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:41,369
<i>The cost of it all, seven percent</i>
<i>of the gross national product.</i>

26
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,914
<i>I understand this concern</i>
<i>on behalf of the taxpayers.</i>

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,376
<i>People want value for money.</i>
<i>That is why we always insist</i>

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,004
<i>on the principle</i>
<i>of Information Retrieval Charges.</i>

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,258
<i>It's absolutely right and fair</i>

30
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,761
<i>that those found guilty</i>
<i>should pay for their periods of detention</i>

31
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,724
<i>and for the information retrieval</i>
<i>procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

32
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,395
<i>Do you believe that the government</i>
<i>is winning against terrorists?</i>

33
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,813
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

34
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,318
<i>We're fielding all their strokes,</i>
<i>running all of them out</i>

35
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>and pretty consistently</i>
<i>knocking them for six.</i>

36
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>I'd say they're nearly out of the game.</i>

37
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign</i>
<i>is now in its 13th year.</i>

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,969
<i>Beginner's luck.</i>

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,097
<i>Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.</i>

40
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>Thank you, David.</i>
<i>And a very merry Christmas to you all.</i>

Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

73
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,818
We're Department of Works!
Department of Works up here.

74

-Careful with those bloody things.
-Sure.

Don't take any notice of them.

Don't touch me!
Why don't you just get out of here.

Don't you worry.
We'II have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

Nothing to worry about.

79

It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry.

80
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,338
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

81

Mistake? We don't make mistakes.

82
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,556
Bloody typical. They've gone back

Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,393
Yes...

85
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,611
Buttle.

86
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,949
Buttle, Archibald.

87
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,126
Oh, shit!

88
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,796
Mister...

89
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,385
Mr. Lowry, would you step in here, please.

90
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,840
Has anybody seen Lowry?

91
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,638
Has anybody seen

92
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,640
Sam Lowry?

93
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,885
Sam.

94
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,841
<i>Hello? Sam. Where are you?</i>

95
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,176
-Hello?
<i>-It's 11:00.</i>

96
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,179
-What?
<i>-It's 11:00.</i>

97
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,014
Mr. Kurtzmann.

98
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,434
You're up late.

99
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,519
Is it?

100
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,320
-The electrics here are up the spout.
<i>-Yeah, I know.</i>

101
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,946
-Yours, too?
-Yes.

102
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,493
I'II be there as soon as I can.
Yes, thanks. 'Bye.

103
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,015
This is not the only statue.

104
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,602
What's this gun for?

105
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,273
This one, Sister,
is a nine millimeter submachine gun

106
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,985
used for close-quarter combat fighting.
Very effective weapon.

107
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,069
Would you like to see it?

108
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,976
Sam!

109
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,979
Jack!

110
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,066
Long time no see.

111
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,861
What are you doing here?

112
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,447
Didn't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

113
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,657
-What's the problem?
-Problem? No problem.

114
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,326
Everything's fine. Marvelous.

115
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,913
Alison's in great shape, kids are fine.
I'm on Security Level 5

116
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,208
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me
more and more. It's been a great year.

117
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,918
You sound worried.

118
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,004
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

119
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,424
Sam, whatever happened to you?

120
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,259
Records.

121
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,773
Sam?

122
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,695
Jack, it's great to see you.
I'm going to be late.

123
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,157
Sam, let a friend tell you
your life is going wrong.

124
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,577
Records is a dead-end department.
No security that's worth a damn.

125
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,997
-It's impossible to get noticed.
-I know. Wonderful.

126
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,458
Marvelous. Perfect.

127
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,753
See you, Jack.
Give my regards to Alison and the twins.

128
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,713
-Triplets.
-Triplets?

129
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,591
God, how time flies.

130
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,138
A very clear delineation of picture, is it not?
Mobile.

131
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,807
Next!

132
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,314
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

133
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,776
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

134
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,904
I've been to Information Adjustments.
They sent me here.

135
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,031
They said you have a form I need to fill out.

136
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,535
-Have you got an arrest receipt?
-Yeah.

137
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,663
Is it stamped?

138
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,832
Stamped?

139
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,503
No, there's no stamp on it, you see.

140
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,340
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

141
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,717
Where do I get it stamped?

142
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,344
Information Adjustments.

143
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,358
It's nothing.

144
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,990
It keeps picking up old films.
That can't be right, can it?

145
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,784
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

146
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,910
No, it's not the machine.

147
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,288
There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

148
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:01,209
Tuttle should've had £31.06
debited against his account, not Buttle.

149
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,212
-My God, a mistake!
-At least it's not ours.

150
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,506
Isn't it? Whose is it?

151
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,092
-Information Retrieval.
-Good.

152
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,471
Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures in respect of

153
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,349
Buttle, Archibald, shoe-repair operative.

154
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,603
But Security has invoiced Admin.
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

155
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,731
What a relief. Well, finish your tea, Sam.

156
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,233
Thanks.

157
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,321
I don't know what I'd do
if you ever got promoted.

158
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,450
-God, don't worry about that.
-But if they did promote you.

159
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,537
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.

160
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,873
-Would you, really?
-Really.

161
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,084
You've been promoted.

162
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,092
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

163
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,600
Sam, it's time for you to grow up
and accept responsibility.

164
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,771
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion.

165
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,817
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

166
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,529
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

167
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,949
No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

168
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,202
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

169
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:22,165
You haven't got the ambition. Luckily,
you've got me and the Deputy Minister.

170
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,292
Mr. Helpmann was very close
to your father.

171
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,587
Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.

172
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,716
Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

173
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,551
-You see?
-God!

174
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,761
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

175
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,180
I'II make you 20 years younger.

176
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,517
Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.

177
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,061
Would you like to be Surgeon General?

178
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,856
I know simply everybody.

179
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,276
They won't know you
when I've finished with you.

180
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,862
First,

181
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,322
we remove the excess derma.

182
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:01,163
Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes
and forehead.

183
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,878
Now, I lift

184
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,256
the wrinkles and the worry lines

185
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,342
right up into the wig, into the hairline.

186
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,472
Now the template.

187
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,769
Now, a bit of sticky. Comme ça!

188
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,564
Already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before.

189
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,648
<i>Voilà!</i>

190
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,195
Mr. Helpmann
was very close to your poor father.

191
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,656
He was close to me. He still is.

192
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,704
He'II take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

193
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,706
You'II like it there.

194
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,125
You're not listening to me, Mother.

195
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,548
What the hell is this, lady?

196
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,551
It's a present for my son. Really!

197
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,347
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.

198
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,059
What on Earth is it?

199
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,062
Something for an executive.

200
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,611
Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

201
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,072
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

202
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,534
-You remember my son, Samuel?
-Of course.

203
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,452
We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

204
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,287
Yes, they're waiting.

205
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,756
-Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk.
-We will.

206
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,385
-Ida!
-God. She's got what's-her-name with her.

207
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,390
Well, Alma, how are you?

208
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,642
You look wonderful.

209
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,811
Hello, Shirley.

210
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,146
Thank you, Spiro.

211
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,649
-Salt?
-Not yet.

212
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,944
Sam, Happy Christmas.

213
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,323
-So sorry we're late.
-Thanks.

214
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,284
Now, Alma

215
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,369
what are you going to have?

216
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,039
I can't make up my mind whether to have
the number one or the number two.

217
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,791
What do you recommend, Spiro?

218
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,002
Between you and me, madame,

219
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,921
-today the number two.
-Thank you, Spiro.

220
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,173
Shirley, what are you going to have?

221
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,344
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

222
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,263
Madam Lowry?

223
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,767
To hell with the diet!
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

224
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,937
-A most perceptive choice, if I may say so.
-Oh, Ida.

225
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,189
<i>-Monsieur?</i>
-Steak, please, rare. Mother...

226
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,942
<i>-Monsieur, quel numéro?</i>
-I don't know which number.

227
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,153
-Mother, please...
-That one. There.

228
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,738
Thanks. Mother, will you...

229
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,909
Alma! You wicked girl.
You've started your treatments.

230
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,661
-Say the number, please.
-You noticed.

231
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,164
-You have to say the number!
-Go away!

232
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,124
I must tell you all about it.

233
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,792
Number three.

234
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,798
-Mother, will you listen to me?
<i>-Numéro huit.</i>

235
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,054
Braised veal in wine sauce.

236
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:11,311
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

237
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,688
<i>Numéro deux, duck à I'orange.</i>

238
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,941
-Chapman?
<i>-Excusez-moi.</i>

239
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,318
The acid man?

240
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,155
Really, Ida. Just because
his techniques are revolutionary.

241
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,367
I don't go around calling
Dr. Jaffe "the knife man."

242
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,203
<i>Numéro un, crevettes à la mayonnaise.</i>

243
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,955
I am sorry, Alma.

244
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,958
-I didn't mean to...
-It's all right, Ida.

245
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,752
<i>Steak. Numéro trois!</i>

246
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,881
<i>Mesdames, monsieur</i>

247
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,759
<i>bon appétit!</i>

248
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,678
<i>-Merci!</i>
<i>-Merci!</i>

249
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:49,474
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading

250
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,643
such delicate nuances.

251
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,146
Like a Rembrandt etching.
And it is so much quicker.

252
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:59,192
If it wasn't for this complication,
it could've happened to anybody,

253
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,404
I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.

254
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,447
Shirley.

255
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,574
Salt?

256
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,725
What were we saying?

257
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,727
God, this isn't rare.

258
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:39,107
By the by, I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

259
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,735
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

260
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,737
That sounds marvelous!

261
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,574
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

262
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:51,369
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations

263
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,788
including Caesarian sections.

264
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,332
-Spiro.
-Madam, I don't know what to say.

265
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,628
This never happens to us. I'm going
to do something about it straightaway.

266
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,799
Sam, can't you do something
about these terrorists?

267
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,010
It's my lunch hour.

268
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,138
Besides, it's not my department.

269
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:15,018
Actually, Alma, that's one of
the little things I've been dying to tell you.

270
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:19,439
Sam's being promoted
to Information Retrieval.

271
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,610
Why, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam.

272
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,364
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

273
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,493
If I wanted to upset you, Mother,
I'd tell you where to stick it.

274
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,873
Pepper?

275
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,126
I've got to go.

276
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,088
You haven't had your dessert.

277
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,882
I don't want dessert,
promotion or anything!

278
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:50,345
Of course you want something.
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams?

279
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,722
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

280
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,026
Sam.

281
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,977
Sam!

282
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,394
Oh, God!

283
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,794
Hello. Central Services?

284
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,048
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section D.

285
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,384
Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

286
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,721
I've got trouble with my air conditioning.
It's an emergency.

287
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,808
<i>Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, due to staff shortages</i>

288
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:05,313
<i>Central Services cannot take service calls</i>
<i>between 2300 and 0900 hours.</i>

289
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,815
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

290
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,567
This is an emergency!

291
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:14,322
<i>-Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
-Look, I've got to have a heating engineer.

292
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,325
<i>-Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
-Oh, shit!

293
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,351
Hello.

294
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,821
-Hello.
<i>-Hello.</i>

295
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,291
<i>Hello, Mr. Lowry.</i>

296
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,126
Yes, who is this?

297
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,713
<i>Put the phone down and raise your hands.</i>

298
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,881
What? Who is this?

299
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,387
Nice and easy, now.

300
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,396
Just keep your hands where I can see them.

301
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,423
What are you doing?

302
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,014
Harry Tuttle, heating engineer,
at your service.

303
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,061
Tuttle?

304
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,397
Are you from Central Services?

305
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,280
I called Central Services.

306
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,782
They're overworked these days.

307
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,910
Luckily, I intercepted your call.

308
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,245
You did...

309
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,792
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

310
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,586
Just a precaution, sir.

311
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,965
I've had traps set for me before now.

312
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:43,388
Plenty of people in Central Services would
love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

313
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,266
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

314
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,358
Well, yes and no.

315
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,985
Officially, only Central Services
can touch this stuff.

316
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,570
Would you hold this, please?

317
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,407
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations

318
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,492
they can't get decent staff anymore.

319
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,161
They turn a blind eye as long as I'm careful.

320
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,665
But if they could prove that I've been
working on their equipment

321
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,000
that's a plate of a different color.

322
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,753
-Wouldn't it be simpler just to...
-Hold this, please.

323
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,171
Sorry, yes.

324
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,758
I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

325
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,802
I couldn't stand the...

326
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,681
-It's getting warm.
-You couldn't stand the what?

327
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,683
I couldn't stand the paperwork.

328
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,184
Listen,

329
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,604
this system of yours could be on fire,
and I couldn't turn on a kitchen tap

330
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,399
without filling out a 27B/6.

331
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,609
Bloody paperwork.

332
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,529
I suppose one has to expect
a certain amount.

333
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,449
Why? I came into this
for the action, the excitement.

334
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:49,036
Go anywhere, travel light. Get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble. A man alone.

335
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,747
They've got the whole country
sectioned off.

336
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,791
Can't make a move without a form.

337
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,060
Found it. There's your problem.

338
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,313
-Can you fix it?
-No, I can't.

339
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,066
But I can bypass it with one of these.

340
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,987
Fine by me.

341
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,744
-Are you expecting anyone?
-No.

342
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,168
Wait here. Wait.

343
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,260
The flashlight.

344
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,349
-Central Services.
-Central Services.

345
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,435
-Yes.
-You rang, sir.

346
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,104
Trouble with your air conditioning?

347
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,773
No, it's all right.

348
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:02,860
It's fixed.

349
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,612
It's fixed?

350
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,741
Yes. I mean, it fixed itself.

351
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,701
Fixed itself, did it?

352
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,870
Yes.

353
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,958
Machines don't fix themselves.

354
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,127
He's tampered with it.

355
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,215
Sorry you had a wasted journey.

356
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,052
I think we ought to have a look.

357
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,890
Have you got a 27B/6?

358
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,308
A 27B/6?

359
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,985
Now look what you've done to him.

360
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,155
Have you got a 27B/6?

361
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,575
Not as such.

362
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,412
But we'II get one.

363
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,748
It's all right, it's all right.

364
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,335
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.

365
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,338
Where would we be
if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?

366
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,007
We'II be back.

367
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,551
We'II be back!

368
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,266
Thanks for coming.

369
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,643
We'II be back, you clever bastard!

370
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,438
-Thank you.
-We'II show you.

371
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,365
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

372
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,127
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

373
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,211
What?

374
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,215
I just happen to know that

375
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,720
Information Retrieval
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,

376
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,555
heating engineer.

377
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,061
You wouldn't by any chance... Would you?

378
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,899
My good friends call me Harry.

379
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,694
Information Retrieval?

380
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,905
The big boys.

381
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,621
What do they want you for?

382
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,127
Time to go.

383
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,213
How's that?

384
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,513
You really must let me give you something.

385
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,103
How much will it be for the work?

386
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:47,608
Come on. You did me a favor.
Just check the corridor.

387
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,154
Thanks.

388
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:55,074
Listen, kid. We're all in this together.

389
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,492
Go on.

390
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:11,841
AII clear.

391
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,330
I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious.

392
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,544
What's playing today?

393
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,671
<i>Casablanca.</i>

394
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,215
<i>Mr. Lowry, step in here, please.</i>

395
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,345
<i>Lowry!</i>

396
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,183
<i>Now, Mr. Lowry!</i>

397
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,240
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

398
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,666
Look at this.

399
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,753
-It's a check.
-It's the refund for Tuttle.

400
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,129
Tuttle?

401
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,591
Buttle. I mean Buttle.

402
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,093
It's been confusion from the word go.

403
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,096
He was overcharged
for Information Retrieval procedures.

404
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,099
And someone, somewhere,
is trying to make us carry the can.

405
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,812
Can I have a look?
I've never seen a refund check before.

406
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,939
I'II bet it's Jeffries.

407
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,025
Yes.

408
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,403
He believes that people
should pay more for their interrogation.

409
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,531
And B: he loathes me.

410
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,449
We've got to get rid of it.

411
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,786
Send it to somebody else.
Better still, send it to Buttle.

412
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,454
After all, it's his check.

413
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,873
I've tried that. Look at this.

414
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,166
You see?

415
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:12,419
The population census
has got him down as dormanted.

416
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:16,090
The Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as deleted.

417
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,174
Hang on.

418
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,635
Information Retrieval's
got him inoperative.

419
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,388
Security has got him down as excised.

420
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,224
-Administration's got him as completed.
-He's dead.

421
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,811
Dead?

422
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,190
Well, that's awful.

423
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,573
We'II never get rid of the damn thing now.

424
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,242
What are we going to do, Sam?

425
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,452
Could try the next of kin.

426
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,046
There we go. "Buttle, Veronica, Mrs."

427
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,506
Veronica?

428
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,759
What's the number on the check?

429
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,138
27156789

430
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,768
/074328K.

431
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,565
Right into memory.

432
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,943
Central Banking.

433
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,113
Veronica Buttle

434
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,073
Mrs.

435
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,534
Deposit.

436
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,426
Thank God for that.

437
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,428
Would you like some tea?

438
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,357
There's a problem.

439
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,901
She doesn't have a bank account.

440
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,823
Well, that's it then.

441
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,078
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

442
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,335
This could never have happened
before the stupid 7th tier reorganization.

443
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,045
That's Simmons' doing.

444
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,547
He and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

445
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,966
Bastards!

446
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,434
Perhaps we could lose the thing
behind a filing cabinet or something

447
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,980
-or burn it, eat it...
-Look. There is one solution.

448
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,107
-What?
-Drive out to Mrs. Buttle

449
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,652
Iet her sign at the back of the check.
She can cash it at the corner sweet shop.

450
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,698
That's brilliant, Sam.

451
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,366
I'II even do it for you.

452
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,785
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

453
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,787
Everything's in here.

454
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,583
What shall I do next?

455
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,587
Pink and blue receipts.

456
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,299
Sign there, there and there.
And sign the check there.

457
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,307
I think I've broken a bone.

458
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:16,478
My wrist is all limp.
What a pathetic creature I am!

459
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,316
I'II do it for you.

460
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,337
Right. I'II be on my way.

461
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,383
Sam?

462
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,472
You are good to me, you know.

463
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,517
<i>-Here's looking at you, kid.</i>
-Here's looking at you.

464
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,039
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you news of a terrorist bombing</i>

465
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,665
<i>at the Blue Lagoon...</i>

466
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,625
Hello. I wonder if you could tell me where...

467
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,418
Piss off!

468
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,466
Hello.

469
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,053
I'II never confess!

470
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,645
Come on, you've got to interrogate me.

471
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,298
Mrs. Buttle?

472
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,262
Mrs. Buttle?

473
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,023
Are you Mrs. Buttle?

474
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,032
My name is Lowry.

475
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,202
Sam Lowry.

476
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,749
I'm from the Ministry of Information.

477
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,129
I've come to give you a check.

478
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,512
It's a refund, actually. There was a mistake.

479
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,431
Mistake?

480
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:43,018
Yes. Not my department, of course.
I'm only Records.

481
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:50,108
I'II tell you what it is. It seems Mr. Buttle
was overcharged by Information Retrieval.

482
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,946
They don't usually make mistakes

483
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,782
but I suppose we're all human.

484
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,580
What happened to the...

485
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,837
Actually, my coming here
is rather unorthodox.

486
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:15,676
Bringing you this check. Any payments are
normally made through Central Computer

487
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,136
but as there were certain

488
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:22,307
difficulties, we thought,
rather than cause delay

489
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,018
we'd let you have it now.

490
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,604
It being Christmas and all.

491
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,899
My husband's dead, isn't he?

492
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,072
I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the Ministry is very scrupulous

493
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,950
about following up
and eradicating any error.

494
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,744
But if you do have any complaints
you wish to make,

495
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,957
I'd be only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

496
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,835
What have you done with his body?

497
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,262
I don't know anything about that.
I'm really just

498
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,556
delivering the check. So if...

499
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,643
Look, if you wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts,

500
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:11,356
I'd be only too happy to leave you in peace.

501
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,608
He hadn't done anything.

502
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,527
He was good!

503
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,616
What have you done with his body?

504
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,418
It isn't being very helpful, is it?

505
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,262
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

506
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,766
I'II kill you, you bastard!

507
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,977
Stop it!

508
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,531
Are you all right?

509
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,701
Are you all right?

510
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,500
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

511
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,709
It's you.

512
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,629
Wait, stop! Don't go!

513
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:32,038
Stop! I had nothing to do with it. Wait!

514
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,331
Stop!

515
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,857
-Go away.
-Her name's Jill.

516
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,901
What?

517
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,486
Jill?

518
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,237
Jill who?

519
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,780
Jill who?

520
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,241
Layton.

521
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,995
Jill Layton.

522
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:15,499
You're a very good little girl.

523
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,585
-What are you doing here?
-Waiting for my daddy.

524
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,463
He will be pleased when he gets home.

525
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,220
Sam, I've just had
the transport pool onto me.

526
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,723
You don't know anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing, do you?

527
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,517
Personnel transporter?

528
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:16,935
What?

529
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:20,355
The pranets, I had a personal transporter.

530
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,816
I'II do the paperwork in the morning.

531
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,903
Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle...

532
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,989
Buttle's check?

533
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,741
Can I forget it?

534
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,245
What a relief. I'm gonna have nightmares.

535
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,541
Damn! Blast!

536
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,544
What's the matter?

537
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,590
You don't happen to know
how to get round an IRQ/3, do you?

538
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,759
AII information
on third level suspects is classified.

539
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:54,306
AII inquiries through Information Retrieval.
That's hopeless, they'II tell you nothing.

540
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,517
Come the time they want something
from us, yes.

541
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,020
There's one way I could get round it.

542
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,982
-I could accept my mother's promotion.
-Yes.

543
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,317
No!

544
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,695
You can't. You turned it down.

545
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,947
I didn't sign the form.

546
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,034
I did it for you.

547
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,287
-You didn't?
-I did.

548
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:19,706
You didn't!

549
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,833
I did.

550
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,962
-Why did you do that?
-That's what you wanted, isn't it?

551
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,007
I don't know.

552
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,801
I don't know what I want.

553
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,889
Come on, before they turn the lights out.

554
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,199
<i>There is one way around it.</i>

555
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,370
<i>I could accept promotion</i>
<i>to Information Retrieval.</i>

556
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,718
What are you doing?

557
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,720
My God, what's going on?

558
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,680
Emergency procedures.

559
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,351
I haven't got an emergency.

560
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:27,977
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

561
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,814
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

562
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,734
Here. Sign that.

563
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,654
What is it?

564
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:41,115
It's a 27B/6. What do you think it is?
Where is he?

565
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,743
Spoor, come here. I found it.

566
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,121
Spoor, come here!

567
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,834
Look there, a bypass valve
on the transformer.

568
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,640
You've had that scab Tuttle here.

569
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,183
What are you talking about?

570
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,687
Who fixed your ducts?

571
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,649
I told you before, they fixed themselves.

572
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,735
Where did this come from,
out of your nostril?

573
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,285
Central Services.

574
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,373
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

575
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,046
This place is in a terrible state.

576
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,134
Just a minute. You're not gonna
leave it like this, are you?

577
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,510
Why not?

578
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:46,097
AII you got to do is blow your nose
and it's fixed, isn't it?

579
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,472
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

580
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,799

587
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,379
It's reply paid.

588
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,922
Is it?

589
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,678
Two, three.

590
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,098
<i>Mother, I'm sorry but I am unable</i>
<i>to come to your party</i>

591
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,350
You don't have to sing it.

592
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,768
I don't?

593
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,778
Aren't you a bit late?
The party started an hour ago.

594
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,656
Yes, it's backlog. Everybody complains.

595
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,451
Was it all right otherwise?

596
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:11,297
<i>Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen</i>
<i>to get into Information Retrieval.</i>

597
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,634
<i>Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>I'm dying to get at this woman.</i>

598
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,187
Where's your invitation?

599
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,481
Don't shoot! Mother!

600
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:34,153
Sam, I'm so glad you came.

601
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,697
Come in.

602
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,658
Mother?

603
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,454
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

604
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,374
Of course. Isn't it wonderful?

605
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,669
The bandages came off just this afternoon.

606
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,296
Come on, darling, join in the fun.

607
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:54,715
Simply everybody's here.

608
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,635
-Is Mr. Helpmann here? Stop shoving!
-He is.

609
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,013
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

610
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,307
Good. I want to talk to him.

611
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:07,228
He says you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

612
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:11,315
-He thinks you should see a doctor.
-Actually, Mother, I've decided...

613
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,859
Louis, you know Sam.

614
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,487
Can you believe it?

615
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,365
It's just me and my little knife.

616
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,741
Snip.

617
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,243
Slice.

618
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,621
-Can you believe it?
-Congratulations.

619
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:28,291
-But this is just the beginning.
-Really?

620
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:31,168
Of course, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

621
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:34,380
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

622
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,384
-No hairlines.
-Really, Louis!

623
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,595
I've been looking for you everywhere.

624
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,061
Mother, I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann.

625
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,814
-You stupid sod.
-Dear boy

626
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,401
what do you think of your mother now?

627
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,236
It will never last.

628
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,073
Excuse me.

629
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,409
Dr. Chapman, did you say something?

630
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,870
That technique, I've tried it.

631
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,415
A nice effect, but highly unstable.

632
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,252
In six months,
she'II look like Grandma Moses.

633
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:15,588
See here, Chapman.

634
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,592
At least mine don't end up looking
like they've been mugged.

635
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:28,851
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

636
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,942
-What happened to you?
-There's a little complication.

637
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:41,614
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

638
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,116
Nothing to worry about.

639
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,620
He's promised these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

640
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:51,123
-Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
-I know.

641
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,420
Here we are.

642
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:01,133
I'm going to leave you two lovebirds
in peace.

643
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,137
Hello, Shirley.

644
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,432
Come on.

645
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,893
Do you want a drink?

646
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,734
Chase those years away.

647
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,486
Listen, Shirley.

648
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,657
Look, your mother and my mother
have the idea that...

649
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:27,410
Look, I'm very flattered.

650
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,163
And, well, I just don't want you
to be under any false impressions.

651
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,832
It's all right.

652
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,167
I don't like you, either.

653
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:38,754
Sam!

654
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,466
Jack! Excuse me, Shirley.

655
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,344
I'm sorry.

656
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,349
-Do you remember Alison?
-Good evening.

657
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,935
Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend.

658
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,020
Alison, yes, of course.

659
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,357
-You look different.
-I'm two years older.

660
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,610
And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
She doesn't like me telling people.

661
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,696
But, in fact, she's really pleased.

662
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,616
-I knew there was something different.
-Remember how they used to stick out?

663
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,868
What?

664
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,370
Yes, well, rather.

665
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:15,791
-I always used to wonder if they were real.
-What, my ears?

666
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,714
-Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.
-Yes, that's...

667
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,009
I always wondered if she wore falsies.

668
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,594
Mr. Helpmann.

669
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,096
False ears.

670
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,058
-Hello, Jack.
-You remember my wife, Alison?

671
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:36,562
Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you?

672
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,190
Barbara's very well. How are you?

673
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,900
-Fine, thanks.
-Good.

674
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:45,112
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

675
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,281
Would you excuse us?

676
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,701
Of course. Come on, Alison. Barbara.

677
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:53,913
Sam,

678
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,919
I need your help.

679
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,735
Thanks very much.

680
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,196
Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help.

681
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,448
And if I can help you...

682
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,123
Your father and I were very close.

683
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:42,795
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

684
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,297
Especially after the bombing.

685
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:50,302
And now I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

686
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,265
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

687
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,100
"'Ere I am

688
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,019
"J. H."

689
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,024
The ghost in the machine.

690
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,488
I know he would've wanted me to help you.

691
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,285
And I promised your mother

692
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:18,455
that I'd take you onto the team
at Information Retrieval.

693
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,834
-But I gather that you...
-Well,

694
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,671
actually, Mr. Helpmann,
I've changed my mind.

695
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,174
I've decided I'd accept the transfer.

696
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,844
If I'm not too late.

697
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,221
Too late?

698
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,348
That's for me to say.

699
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:39,518
Well, then I am...

700
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,815
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

701
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,933
My name's Lowry.

702
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,728
Sam Lowry.

703
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,607
I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn.

704
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,068
Thirtieth floor, sir.

705
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,903
You're expected.

706
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,826
-Don't you want to search me?
-No, sir.

707
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,748
-Want to see my ID?
-No need, sir.

708
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,295
-But I could be anybody.
-No, you couldn't, sir.

709
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,756
This is Information Retrieval.

710
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,093
The lift's arrived, sir.

711
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,120
Half as terrorists, rest as victims.

712
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,498
Definitely, no.

713
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,083
My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn.
Sam Lowry.

714
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,420
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

715
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,840
Glad to have you on board.

716
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,178
Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

717
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,763
Yes.

718
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,432
You'II like it up here.

719
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,019
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding? ...decision makers.

720
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:13,357
In triplicate. I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Finance! ...of you.

721
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,196
Between you and me, Lowry,

722
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:22,783
this department is about to be upgraded.

723
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,037
Here we are.

724
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,915
Your very own number
on your very own door.

725
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,960
And behind that door, your very own office.

726
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,213
Congratulations, DZ/015.

727
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,215
Welcome to the team.

728
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,717
Yes. No. Cancel that.

729
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,095
Send two copies to Finance.

730
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,025
You can't borrow any more chairs!
There's only one left in here now

731
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,611
-and I need that to sit on!
-What?

732
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:26,865
Sorry.

733
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,660
Who are you?

734
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,537
My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

735
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,499
Oh, yes, the new boy from next door.

736
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:39,419
My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.

737
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,922
Welcome to Expediting.

738
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:45,467
Would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

739
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,303
I'II let you have it back in 10 minutes.

740
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:51,473
You want to take my console
into your office?

741
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,101
Yes, just for a few minutes.

742
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,978
I'II tell you what,

743
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:59,398
you tell me what you want,
and I'II do it for you.

744
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,859
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

745
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,947
AII right.

746
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:12,452
-I need information on a woman named...
-A woman?

747
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,496
-I see.
-Yes.

748
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,834
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address, her place of work.

749
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,169
This your dream girl, is it?

750
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,341
Look, let me use your console.

751
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,552
You must be joking.

752
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:32,472
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

753
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,350
Let's have that sheet.

754
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,403
Sod it, it's broken!

755
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,031
But you haven't switched it on.

756
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,949
Oh, yes.

757
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,330
You're putting me off standing there.
Go back to your office.

758
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:00,333
I'II give you a knock when I've finished.

759
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,754
Go on, I'm not going to elope with her.

760
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,465
AII right.

761
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,335
Sam!

762
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:07,776
Sam.

763
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,531
Don't go.

764
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,034
Please.

765
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,173
Well?

766
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:34,386
-Computers are my forte.
-Let me see.

767
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:39,975
"Gillian Layton. Coloring: white.
Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Height: 5'4".

768
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,561
"Distinguishing scar on left..."

769
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:44,729
Is this all you've got?

770
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:48,900
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

771
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,569
Let me see.

772
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,405
Hey, that's mine!

773
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:55,991
"Layton.

774
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,578
"Truck driver. AII inquiries

775
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:03,415
"reference officer 412/L. Room 5001."

776
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:08,086
Lowry, glad I caught you.

777
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:11,673
Send that back. Settling down?
I want this order rescinded.

778
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:15,510
There's a query about a personnel
transporter you took out from the pool.

779
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:18,513
Or was it a personnel carrier you took?

780
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:23,059
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, there's a good chap.

781
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,896
Get a new suit. You want the lift?

782
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,975
Can I help you?

783
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,109
I'm looking for Officer 412/L.

784
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,653
He won't be very long now.

785
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,199
I thought so.

786
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,582
You may go in now.

787
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:17,090
Not that one. That one.

788
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,217
Yes.

789
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,561
Excuse me, are you officer 412/L?

790
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,944
Excuse me!

791
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,489
Jack!

792
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,996
I heard you were coming aboard.
Congratulations.

793
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,415
-DZ/015.
-Thanks.

794
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,625
Are you officer 412/L?

795
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,920
That's me. For Sam.

796
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,965
-A very happy Christmas.
-Thanks, Jack.

797
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:02,135
-You're settling in all right?
-Yes, fine.

798
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,095
I need some information.

799
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,308
This is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

800
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,353
Amy, don't throw the ball around in here.

801
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:15,357
-I'm not Amy, I'm Holly.
-Did I call you Amy, darling? I am sorry.

802
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,275
-A triplet?
-One of them, I think.

803
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,528
Barbara's taken
the other two Christmas shopping.

804
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:23,406
You're not gonna
keep calling her Barbara, are you?

805
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:27,243
Why not? Barbara's a perfectly good name,
isn't it? Don't you like it?

806
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,622
Yes, it's fine.

807
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,292
Come on, let's get these together.

808
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:38,630
I need to find out about a woman.

809
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,217
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam
how we make the word "cat."

810
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,010
-Shall we?
-I'm Holly.

811
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,720
Sorry, love. So you are.

812
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:47,305
This is her.

813
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,351
Layton. Oh, shit.

814
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:56,815
-How much do you know about this?
-Not much.

815
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,692
-What does B58/732 mean to you?
-Buttle.

816
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,322
I knew it. You always were bloody quick.

817
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,908
Who else knows?

818
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,743
Warrenn? Helpmann?

819
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,413
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

820
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,374
Information Transit got the wrong man.

821
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:18,002
I got the right man. The wrong man
was delivered to me as the right man.

822
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,214
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man.

823
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:22,382
Was I wrong?

824
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,384
You killed Buttle?

825
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:30,014
There are rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

826
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:33,810
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's
heart condition wasn't on Tuttle's file.

827
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,562
How are you getting on?

828
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,692
-I really need to know about...
-Tuttle?

829
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,735
We'II bring Tuttle in

830
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:46,406
and interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

831
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,700
And juggle the books in electrical banking.

832
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:52,912
-What has Tuttle done?
-We suspect him of freelance subversion.

833
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,706
Freelance subversive?

834
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,460
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

835
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:02,755
-What has she done?
-She witnessed the Tuttle... Buttle arrest.

836
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,967
Since then she's been going around
making wild allegations

837
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,760
trying to exploit the situation.

838
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:10,221
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

839
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:12,849
Terrorist?

840
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,104
<i>Mr. Lint, the next customer</i>
<i>has been delivered.</i>

841
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:20,648
-Thank you, Myrtle.
-What're you gonna do about Layton?

842
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,944
I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

843
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,530
What, here?

844
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,909
So that she can spill the beans
inside the department?

845
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,243
Don't do that.

846
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,956
Why don't I try and get to her for you? I'II...

847
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,376
-I'II deactivate her.
-What does that mean?

848
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,420
I want nothing unsavory.

849
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,214
Trust me, Jack.

850
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,717
Come on, put these away.
Mommy will be back.

851
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:48,801
Let me have her file.

852
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,139
Trust me, Jack.

853
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,850
AII right.

854
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,564
But for Christ's sake, don't lose it.

855
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,276
You sit down there, darling.

856
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,655
Don't worry, I'II get to her.

857
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:11,032
You'II never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

858
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,077
Here.

859
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,539
Try this.

860
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,041
-Bye-bye.
-'Bye.

861
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:23,670
But, Jack, I...

862
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:28,883
Put it on, big boy. I won't look at your willy.

863
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,521
Let him go.

864
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,249
Shit!

865
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,391
Oi!

866
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,518
-Come out of there.
-What?

867
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,104
That's the Deputy Minister's lift.

868
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,356
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

869
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,693
Come here, sonny. Let's see your ID card.

870
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:52,944
My ID?

871
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:54,445
Oh, God!

872
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,490
This isn't my suit.

873
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,243
Look, my name's Lowry, Sam Lowry.

874
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,413
-Look, really, can't this wait?
-No, sir.

875
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,290
I'm going to have to fill in a report on this.

876
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,960
Now, then, what is the date today?

877
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,629
It's the... Oh, God, it'II have to wait!

878
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:13,297
You, stop!

879
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,539
Stop!

880
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:03,181
Well done, men. Quick thinking.

881
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:05,808
Excellent work.

882
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:10,021
I'II take charge of her now.

883
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,355
Good.

884
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:14,692
Okay.

885
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:20,072
It's a classified matter.

886
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:26,704
I'II include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

887
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:28,915
Great.

888
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,503
Merry Christmas, Dawson.

889
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:36,172
Come along with me, please.

890
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,758
Okay, thanks. Well done, men.

891
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:42,553
Excellent. Good turnout.
Very good, thank you.

892
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,867
Just keep moving.

893
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:06,369
Hey, stop!

894
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,914
Come back here.

895
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,083
Pick up all these things.

896
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,293
Come on, pick them up.

897
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:17,088
Disgraceful.

898
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:19,882
Can't you even...

899
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:21,968
You illiterate foreign pig!

900
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:25,304
You come over here
from your own filthy country

901
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,392
and mess up our streets.

902
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,435
God!

903
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,661
Well done! Let's go!

904
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:56,961
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

905
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,172
Get out of my cab.

906
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:02,049
What? Just drive!

907
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:07,722
-You've touched me. Nobody touches me.
-What do you...

908
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,517
Please, drive on! Drive on, will you?

909
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,227
Shit. Move over, I'II drive.

910
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:16,147
Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

911
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,529
It's okay, Officer. Thank you.
I've got everything under control.

912
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:25,531
Oh, shit!

913
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:30,661
Listen, please drive. Trust me.
You are in terrible danger.

914
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,538
You're an embarrassment.

915
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,832
Please drive. Trust me.

916
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,293
Drive and I'II explain everything.

917
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,379
Please, get out of my cab.

918
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,091
I'm sorry, I...

919
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:48,596
Okay, you've asked for it.
I'm Information Retrieval Officer

920
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,767
DZ/105 and I'm arresting you so

921
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:56,771
drive on, or I'II blast your fucking head off!

922
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:00,358
Go!

923
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,049
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I mean, touching you without permission.

924
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,470
Hello, my name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

925
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,431
I've been...

926
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,690
You won't believe this.
I know it will sound incredible

927
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:43,818
but I've been dreaming about you.

928
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:47,405
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

929
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:51,283
I mean, in my dreams, I love you and...

930
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,705
Extraordinary, isn't it?

931
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:00,793
Anyway.

932
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,759
You don't believe me, do you?

933
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:15,349
You probably think I'm bonkers, right?
Mad, raving.

934
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:20,104
No! I think you're very attractive.

935
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:23,733
What?

936
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:27,361
Yeah. Sit back. Let me have a look at you.

937
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:36,912
Oh, yeah.

938
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:40,458
Good looking, sexy. Just my type.

939
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:45,588
I don't believe you.

940
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:47,631
Why not?

941
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,343
Well, I just don't deserve such terrific luck.

942
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,722
You're damn right.

943
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:43,998
You don't trust me, do you?

944
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:23,370
-Oh, my God, we shouldn't have come here!
-I've got a job to do.

945
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:25,706
But they'II be lying in wait!

946
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:29,293
Christ, you're paranoid.
You got no sense of reality.

947
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,086
Wait!

948
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:39,053
-We should take the lorry and get away!
-Yeah, where to?

949
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:42,556
-Anywhere. As fast as possible.
-There isn't anywhere.

950
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,643
-Just far away.
-It's not far enough.

951
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,161
Jill!

952
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,300
What's in the parcel?

953
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:02,594
A Christmas present.

954
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:12,187
It's heavy.

955
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,149
Heavy Christmas present.

956
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,526
If you don't trust me, open it.

957
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,945
No, it's fine.

958
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,407
I'd spoil the wrapping.

959
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:28,579
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
it's only fair that I should trust you.

960
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:40,424
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

961
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,095
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

962
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:52,644
How many actual terrorists
have you met, Sam?

963
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,233
-Actual terrorists?
-Yeah.

964
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:04,448
It's only my first day.

965
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:19,505
A roadblock.

966
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:23,342
-What're we gonna do?
-Stay calm.

967
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,512
Don't slow down! Don't stop!

968
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:29,807
Please, do as I say. Go straight ahead. Go!

969
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,520
What the fuck are you doing, you stupid...

970
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:50,202
We did it! We broke right through them!

971
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:00,879
Faster! Don't let them see you. Just go!

972
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,300
Keep going! Faster!

973
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,347
-Please, get your foot down!
-Stay off of me!

974
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:45,382
Go faster!

975
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:54,808
-What if we lose the house?
-Don't touch anything!

976
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:57,478
Don't touch that!

977
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:24,421
We did it! We did it!

978
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:32,262
Oh, no!

979
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,696
What would you like for Christmas?

980
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:51,573
My own credit card.

981
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:05,337
-Why have we come here?
-Go away.

982
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:08,924
-Why don't we go back to my flat?
-Forget it.

983
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:10,217
You don't trust me?

984
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:13,637
Trust you? A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job

985
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,390
has every security man in town
looking for me? Of course I do.

986
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,725
-I was only trying to help.
-Yeah!

987
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,604
I don't trust you either.
What's in that parcel?

988
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,857
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be very special.

989
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:29,194
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not very special.

990
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:31,863
-I'm gonna open it.
-Don't touch it.

991
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:42,749
Sam!

992
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,418
It's me

993
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,295
and Shirley.

994
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,382
Mrs. Terrain!

995
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:56,680
-That should hold it.
-Sam?

996
01:38:57,223 --> 01:38:58,765
Hello, Shirley.

997
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:04,146
What's happened to you now?

998
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:07,691
My complication had a little complication.

999
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:11,361
But Dr. Chapman says I'II soon be up

1000
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:14,364
and bounding about like a young gazelle.

1001
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:18,035
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

1002
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:22,914
Yes, a little something.

1003
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:26,460
Shirley and I come here regular-Iarly.

1004
01:39:27,754 --> 01:39:29,796
We love romantic lingerie.

1005
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:35,344
Picture me in these.

1006
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:42,684
Oh, my God!

1007
01:39:42,852 --> 01:39:45,228
Sam, where are you going?

1008
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:58,492
Jill?

1009
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:23,517
Are you all right?

1010
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,563
You don't deserve to be!

1011
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:31,274
What a bloody stupid thing!

1012
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,735
How could you? Look at these people!

1013
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,070
My God!

1014
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:38,031
It was a bomb!

1015
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:41,702
I should've opened it.
I sat there with it next...

1016
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,372
There's your bomb, asshole!

1017
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:52,796
A bribe for official monkeys like you.

1018
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:58,593
Make yourself useful.

1019
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:06,601
Here!

1020
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:14,151
Don't touch her! She's hurt.

1021
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,156
Don't touch her!

1022
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,077
Stop!

1023
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,795
Sam, no!

1024
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,604
These helmets make your scalp itch.

1025
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,648
Don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

1026
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,860
Half the time I can never see
where I'm going.

1027
01:41:56,986 --> 01:42:00,280
It's a great Niagara of perspiration
coming down.

1028
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:04,451
I'm lucky. I've got these thick eyebrows.

1029
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:08,038
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

1030
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,122
Jill!

1031
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,290
Who's he?

1032
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:13,627
I don't know,
somebody from Information Retrieval.

1033
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:15,962
They're always hanging around in lingerie.

1034
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,130
Where is she?

1035
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,177
Jill, is that you?

1036
01:42:23,012 --> 01:42:26,014
Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

1037
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,480
Jill! Answer me!

1038
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:37,984
I'm looking for a girl with blonde hair.

1039
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,487
She's medium height, green eyes.

1040
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:43,824
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

1041
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:48,078
We can't allow that.
It's more than our job's worth.

1042
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,580
Jill, you must be here.

1043
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,917
You can fill in an application form
if you're a relative.

1044
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:56,086
Now do stop, sir, please.

1045
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:05,762
Sorry about that, sir.

1046
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:07,722
Regulations.

1047
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,523
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

1048
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:18,859
I don't care how you behaved at Records.

1049
01:43:18,943 --> 01:43:21,361
Informational Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1050
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:24,364
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1051
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:28,326
That convoy of personnel carriers
is still not accounted for!

1052
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,496
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what is this mess?

1053
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:34,791
An empty desk is an efficient desk!
Good God!

1054
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,545
Queries from Security. Searches
from Central Banking about a check.

1055
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:42,048
Clarification notices from Accounting
about unreturned receipts!

1056
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:45,093
-Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out...
-Shut up!

1057
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:48,346
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

1058
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:54,060
But don't think you can intimidate us
with your friends in high places!

1059
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:55,645
Now shape up!

1060
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:02,944
Lime, I have to use your computer.

1061
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:05,488
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.

1062
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:09,451
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1063
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:17,250
Shit!

1064
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:19,753
Come off it, Jack.

1065
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,589
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

1066
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:27,844
Sorry, Sam, this case has become
more complicated since last we talked.

1067
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:31,556
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1068
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:34,893
Tell that to the wives of the men
she blew up this afternoon.

1069
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:37,020
She's not alone in all this.

1070
01:44:37,146 --> 01:44:39,105
We just had a report in that Tuttle

1071
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:42,901
has wrecked an entire flat
and sabotaged adjacent Central Services.

1072
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:45,445
As a matter of fact,
it looks like in your block.

1073
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:48,698
I'd keep my eyes open if I were you. 'Bye.

1074
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:53,787
But, Jack, you don't think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

1075
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:56,998
I do. Everything's connected.
AII along the line.

1076
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,417
Cause and effect, that's the beauty of it.

1077
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:03,254
Our job is to trace the connections
and then reveal them.

1078
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:09,636
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

1079
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,388
But, Jack...

1080
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,140
She's innocent, Jack.

1081
01:45:16,268 --> 01:45:19,562
-We've always been close, haven't we?
-Yes, Jack.

1082
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:23,066
Until this all blows over,
just stay away from me.

1083
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,367
It's you!

1084
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:40,703
What's happening?

1085
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:44,124
Your thermostat's gone, and then some.

1086
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,168
What happened to my flat?

1087
01:47:47,253 --> 01:47:48,962
Hello? What?

1088
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,214
It's for you, but,

1089
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:53,466
as you don't live here anymore.

1090
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:54,968
-What?
-Absolutely.

1091
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:56,636
Do you know what this is?

1092
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,722
This is an H2206

1093
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:04,435
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat

1094
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,604
for our necessary repairs.

1095
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:12,527
Don't forget your receipt!

1096
01:48:14,864 --> 01:48:17,907
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork.

1097
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,163
Bastards!

1098
01:48:36,302 --> 01:48:38,094
What are you doing?

1099
01:49:25,935 --> 01:49:28,061
It's getting cold in here.

1100
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:31,481
Oh, God!

1101
01:49:32,233 --> 01:49:33,900
It smells badly.

1102
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:37,528
It's shit! We're filling up with shit!

1103
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:55,088
Oh, shit.

1104
01:49:57,466 --> 01:49:59,801
We're all in it together, kid.

1105
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:14,232
Jill!

1106
01:50:19,071 --> 01:50:20,822
Are you all right?

1107
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:25,243
-What happened to you after...
-Your face. Are you hurt?

1108
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,621
No, I'm fine.

1109
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:35,086
I've been worried sick about you.

1110
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:51,060
-Who was that?
-That's a friend of mine.

1111
01:50:52,813 --> 01:50:54,522
Oh, God! Holy shit!

1112
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:56,816
We better get out of here, quick. Come on.

1113
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:04,490
Thank God! Here, take it.

1114
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,453
It's not so big.

1115
01:52:00,506 --> 01:52:02,340
Are you sure this is all right?

1116
01:52:02,424 --> 01:52:03,925
Yes, certain.

1117
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:07,720
My mother's away for Christmas.

1118
01:52:08,806 --> 01:52:11,766
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

1119
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:17,063
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1120
01:52:57,563 --> 01:53:01,315
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

1121
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,568
I won't be long.

1122
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,905
-Where're you going?
-I know a way to save you.

1123
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,116
Trust me. I can do it.

1124
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,909
You can't go without me!

1125
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:50,615
Excuse me, Dawson, could you
put me through to Mr. Helpmann's office?

1126
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:54,827
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have
to go through the proper channels.

1127
01:53:54,912 --> 01:53:57,580
And you can't tell me what
the proper channels are

1128
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:00,416
because that's classified information.

1129
01:54:01,043 --> 01:54:05,713
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest.

1130
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:08,174
Thank you, Dawson.

1131
01:54:15,307 --> 01:54:18,184
-Goodnight, Mr. Lime.
-Goodnight, Dawson.

1132
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:52,843
No, no, Arthur. You're flat on the G!

1133
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:56,556
It's your breathing.
Take a deep breath after "Noel."

1134
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,599
Ready, one, two, three.

1135
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:13,739
<i>"'Ere I am, J.H."</i>

1136
01:55:14,825 --> 01:55:16,659
<i>The ghost in the machine.</i>

1137
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,479
Mr. Helpmann?

1138
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:24,769
Mr. Helpmann?

1139
01:57:48,145 --> 01:57:49,311
Jill.

1140
01:58:41,156 --> 01:58:42,156
Who's there?

1141
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:52,917
What do you think?

1142
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,294
Is it me?

1143
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:03,135
What?

1144
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:10,726
You don't exist anymore.

1145
01:59:11,686 --> 01:59:13,354
I've killed you.

1146
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:19,985
Jill Layton is dead.

1147
01:59:28,745 --> 01:59:31,080
Care for a little necrophilia?

1148
02:00:34,853 --> 02:00:36,520
Merry Christmas.

1149
02:00:50,035 --> 02:00:52,202
Something for an executive?

1150
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:11,972
She's dead.

1151
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:14,475
This is a friend of mine.

1152
02:01:17,228 --> 02:01:18,270
No!

1153
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:20,856
Sam!

1154
02:01:27,781 --> 02:01:31,367
93/HKS/608, you are charged
with the following:

1155
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,869
"Giving aid and comfort
to the enemies of society.

1156
02:01:33,954 --> 02:01:36,246
"Attempting to conceal a fugitive
from justice.

1157
02:01:36,331 --> 02:01:39,917
"Passing confidential documents
to unauthorized personnel.

1158
02:01:40,001 --> 02:01:43,170
"Destroying government property,
viz. several personnel carriers.

1159
02:01:43,254 --> 02:01:46,090
"Taking possession under false pretences
of said carriers.

1160
02:01:46,174 --> 02:01:48,926
"Forging the signature
of the Head of Records.

1161
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:52,471
"Misdirecting funds in the form
of a check to A. Buttle

1162
02:01:52,555 --> 02:01:54,348
"through unauthorized channels.

1163
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:56,475
"Tampering with Central Services'
supply ducts.

1164
02:01:56,559 --> 02:01:59,353
"Obstructing forces of law and order.

1165
02:01:59,437 --> 02:02:01,772
"Disgracing the good name
of the government

1166
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,316
"and the Department
of Information Retrieval.

1167
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:08,195
"Disrupting the Ministry's
internal communicating system.

1168
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:11,365
"Wasting Ministry time and paper."

1169
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:15,828
Now, either you can plead guilty
to seven or eight of the charges

1170
02:02:15,912 --> 02:02:19,248
which will help keep costs down
within your means

1171
02:02:19,332 --> 02:02:23,585
or borrow a sum to be negotiated
from us at a very competitive rate.

1172
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:27,256
We can offer you something
at eleven-and-a-half percent over 30 years

1173
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:30,426
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

1174
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:32,761
If you prefer something more specific

1175
02:02:32,846 --> 02:02:35,639
say, against electrical charges over £70...

1176
02:02:35,807 --> 02:02:38,600
AII you're requested to do now
is sign this form.

1177
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:40,561
Think carefully before you sign.

1178
02:02:40,645 --> 02:02:43,981
Thinking ahead in financial matters
is always a wise course.

1179
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:45,524
Plead guilty.

1180
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:47,109
It's cheaper.

1181
02:02:51,906 --> 02:02:55,117
Sam, what are we going to do with you?

1182
02:02:58,204 --> 02:02:59,705
Where's Jill?

1183
02:03:01,249 --> 02:03:03,125
I've got to find her.

1184
02:03:03,585 --> 02:03:06,503
Please, you've got to get me out of here.

1185
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:10,507
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel

1186
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:13,802
so I brought you a bottle of barley water.

1187
02:03:14,262 --> 02:03:16,305
Please help me.

1188
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:20,059
I assure you,
I'm doing everything within my power.

1189
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:23,020
But the rules of the game are laid down.

1190
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:26,440
We all have to play by them. Even me.

1191
02:03:28,068 --> 02:03:31,695
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

1192
02:03:32,572 --> 02:03:37,242
From the Department's point of view,
there was certainly a bit of an own goal.

1193
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,161
I'm not a terrorist.

1194
02:03:39,788 --> 02:03:42,664
You know that. Please get me out of here!

1195
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:46,001
Sam, Information Retrieval is expensive.

1196
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:49,588
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

1197
02:03:52,008 --> 02:03:53,884
Please, Mr. Helpmann,

1198
02:03:54,844 --> 02:03:56,637
help me find Jill.

1199
02:04:02,185 --> 02:04:04,686
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

1200
02:04:05,814 --> 02:04:09,608
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

1201
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:13,987
Thrown in the towel.

1202
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:16,573
Dead?

1203
02:04:17,742 --> 02:04:18,867
Yes.

1204
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:24,123
It's all a bit confusing, but it seems
she was killed resisting arrest.

1205
02:04:29,504 --> 02:04:31,880
No, it's all right. I did that.

1206
02:04:35,218 --> 02:04:38,095
The odd thing is
it appears to have happened twice.

1207
02:04:38,179 --> 02:04:40,889
A bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

1208
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:44,226
Twice?

1209
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:49,731
There you are. AII I can say is
don't fall at the last fence.

1210
02:04:50,066 --> 02:04:53,235
The finish is in sight.
See you in the paddock.

1211
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:56,155
Do cooperate. Think of your mother.

1212
02:04:56,364 --> 02:04:58,740
Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball.

1213
02:04:58,825 --> 02:05:01,910
Got to go. Can't keep the orphans waiting.

1214
02:05:11,504 --> 02:05:12,546
No!

1215
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:34,443
Don't fight it, son. Confess. Quickly.

1216
02:05:35,778 --> 02:05:40,032
If you hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

1217
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,000
Jack?

1218
02:06:41,135 --> 02:06:42,427
Shut up!

1219
02:06:44,847 --> 02:06:47,432
Jack, I'm innocent. Please help me.

1220
02:06:47,809 --> 02:06:49,101
Bastard!

1221
02:06:51,646 --> 02:06:54,523
Jack, this is all a mistake. Please, Jack.

1222
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:56,400
Take that mask off.

1223
02:07:01,739 --> 02:07:03,532
You stupid bastard!

1224
02:07:05,493 --> 02:07:07,411
How could you do this to me?

1225
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:09,162
Jack, I'm frightened.

1226
02:07:09,247 --> 02:07:11,790
How do you think I feel? You shit!

1227
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:13,542
-Jack...
-Shut up!

1228
02:07:18,256 --> 02:07:22,467
This is a professional relationship.

1229
02:07:26,472 --> 02:07:28,015
You can't!

1230
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,935
No, Jack, please!

1231
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:22,736
You okay?

1232
02:08:22,862 --> 02:08:24,112
Tuttle!

1233
02:08:24,655 --> 02:08:26,198
Call me Harry.

1234
02:09:14,122 --> 02:09:15,455
Let's go!

1235
02:14:25,683 --> 02:14:29,477
Mr. Lowry, so pleased you could make it.

1236
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:31,521
Right this way.

1237
02:14:36,986 --> 02:14:38,653
It's a sad loss.

1238
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:41,614
Your mother was with her at the end.

1239
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:49,956
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1240
02:14:51,167 --> 02:14:53,501
She came to us physically new.

1241
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:57,380
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

1242
02:14:57,465 --> 02:14:59,841
But the spirit never grows old.

1243
02:15:01,427 --> 02:15:02,969
Madam Lowry!

1244
02:15:07,475 --> 02:15:08,725
Mother!

1245
02:15:10,352 --> 02:15:11,561
Sam!

1246
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:14,856
Mother?

1247
02:15:16,734 --> 02:15:18,568
Stop calling me that.

1248
02:15:20,738 --> 02:15:23,656
Mother, please!

1249
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:26,284
Is this guy bothering you?

1250
02:15:27,495 --> 02:15:28,536
Mother!

1251
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:33,958
Go away. This is a very sacred moment.

1252
02:18:43,816 --> 02:18:45,775
He's got away from us, Jack.

1253
02:18:45,859 --> 02:18:49,153
I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.
He's gone.

1254
02:19:30,612 --> 02:19:34,157
<i>Tomorrow was another day</i>

1255
02:19:35,617 --> 02:19:39,537
<i>The morning found me miles away</i>

1256
02:19:40,831 --> 02:19:45,126
<i>With still a million things to say</i>

1257
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:50,882
<i>Now</i>

1258
02:19:51,592 --> 02:19:55,887
<i>As twilight beams the sky above</i>

1259
02:19:56,930 --> 02:20:00,349
<i>Recalling thrills of our love</i>

1260
02:20:02,394 --> 02:20:06,397
<i>There's one thing I'm certain of</i>

1261
02:20:07,149 --> 02:20:11,903
<i>Return I will</i>

1262
02:20:13,739 --> 02:20:19,744
<i>To old Brazil</i>
