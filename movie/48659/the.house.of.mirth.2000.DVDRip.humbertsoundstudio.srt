{3043}{3106}Mr Selden, what luck.
{3125}{3168}-Good luck?|-Yes...
{3176}{3225}I'm on my way to Gus Trenor's|at Bellmont...
{3230}{3291}and I've missed the three-fifteen|to Rhinebeck...
{3296}{3351}and there isn't another train|till half past five.
{3375}{3426}How nice that you come|to my rescue.
{3446}{3497}What form should my rescue take?
{3518}{3565}Oh, almost any.
{3606}{3673}Shall we go to Sherry's fortea?
{3677}{3771}I'm dying for a cup of tea, but|isn't there a quieter place?
{3777}{3812}I live near here.
{3818}{3856}-At the Benedick still?|-Yes.
{3860}{3893}On the top floor.
{3907}{3944}Is it cool up there?
{3957}{3979}Come up and see.
{4094}{4128}I'll take the risk.
{4259}{4351}Oh, how delicious to have a place|like this all to oneself.
{4359}{4435}Even women have been known to enjoy|the privileges ofa flat.
{4439}{4517}Governesses, yes, but not|poor marriageable girls.
{4527}{4580}I even knew a girl|who once lived in a flat.
{4600}{4663}Oh, if I could only do over|my aunt's drawing room...
{4667}{4710}I should be a better woman.
{4723}{4758}Is it so bad?
{4768}{4817}That shows how seldom|you come there.
{4832}{4879}Why don't you come oftener?
{4907}{4995}When I do come, it's not to look|at Mrs Peniston's furniture.
{5001}{5027}Nonsense.
{5035}{5069}You don't come at all.
{5082}{5139}Yet we get on so well when we meet.
{5153}{5189}Cream or lemon?
{5193}{5213}Lemon.
{5244}{5287}I can't make you out.
{5336}{5391}Of course there are men who|dislike me...
{5405}{5456}and others who are afraid of me.
{5485}{5528}They think I want to marry them.
{5561}{5618}But I don't think you dislike me.
{5631}{5692}And you can't possibly think I want|to marry you.
{5697}{5750}No, I absolve you from that.
{5823}{5847}Well then?
{5851}{5906}Well, perhaps that's the reason.
{5948}{5978}The reason forwhat?
{5982}{6035}The fact you don'twant to marry|me.
{6040}{6124}Perhaps I don't see that as a|strong inducement to go see you.
{6150}{6187}Dear Mr Selden...
{6203}{6279}it's stupid of you to be|disingenuous...
{6287}{6336}and it's not like you to be stupid.
{6711}{6764}I've been about too long.
{6781}{6832}People are getting tired of me.
{6927}{6995}They're saying I ought to marry.
{7002}{7032}Isn't marriage yourvocation?
{7036}{7079}What you're all brought up for?
{7099}{7133}I suppose so.
{7151}{7215}So why not take the plunge and|have it over?
{7356}{7393}You collect, do you?
{7405}{7456}First editions and things?
{7474}{7531}And do you collect Americana?
{7544}{7597}No, that's ratherout of my line.
{7607}{7671}And Americana are horribly dull,|I suppose?
{7675}{7703}I should fancy so.
{7708}{7751}Except to the historian.
{7763}{7845}And yet they do fetch such fabulous|prices, don't they?
{7850}{7907}Oh, only the very rich can afford|to buy them.
{7918}{7963}And you knowthat I'm not rich.
{7982}{8033}But life is very expensive.
{8354}{8401}Do you mind not being rich?
{8418}{8448}And having towork...
{8463}{8487}do you mind that?
{8491}{8544}Oh, the work itself is not so bad.
{8557}{8606}I'm rather fond of the law.
{8610}{8669}But do you mind enough to have|to marry to get out of it?
{8674}{8700}God forbid.
{8705}{8769}You see, there's the difference.
{8801}{8883}A girl must, and a man if he|chooses.
{8907}{8983}Perhaps you'll meet your fate|tonight at the Trenor's.
{9011}{9056}I thought you might go there.
{9062}{9103}Those big parties bore me.
{9137}{9172}As they do me.
{9199}{9233}Then why go?
{9294}{9316}You forget...
{9345}{9390}it's part of the business.
{9576}{9617}Good luck at Bellmont.
{9862}{9888}Miss Bart?
{9981}{10019}Well, of all people.
{10023}{10074}Oh, Mr Rosedale.
{10079}{10107}Howare you?
{10111}{10148}Been up town doing some shopping?
{10152}{10168}Yes.
{10173}{10226}I came up to see my dressmaker.
{10230}{10295}I didn't know there were|any dressmakers at the Benedick.
{10300}{10324}That's the name of this building?
{10328}{10346}Yes.
{10351}{10381}I own it.
{10395}{10461}The name means|"confirmed bachelor".
{10509}{10566}I'm on my way to the Trenor's.
{10575}{10624}Let me take you to the station.
{10628}{10646}No.
{10652}{10672}Thank you.
{10676}{10698}You are very kind...
{10703}{10750}but I don't want to trouble you.
{12014}{12094}MrGryce, it's you.
{12133}{12174}The seat next to me is empty.
{12190}{12210}Do take it.
{12565}{12610}I suppose you're off to Bellmont.
{12619}{12668}Yes. For a week.
{12675}{12709}A whole week?
{12713}{12741}How delicious.
{13040}{13093}How are you getting on with your|Americana?
{13107}{13148}I've got a few new things.
{13164}{13223}Your uncle had a very fine|collection, I believe.
{13231}{13305}Yes, he collected for|a number of years, but...
{13311}{13360}I must have this seat, Lily...
{13423}{13470}Mr Gryce.
{13474}{13506}How do you do?
{13523}{13591}I came this morning from|Mount Kisco in the motor car.
{13595}{13648}Had to kick my heels at|Garrison's for an hour...
{13653}{13691}without even a cigarette.
{13695}{13750}I don't suppose you have|one left, have you, Lily?
{13754}{13801}What an absurd question, Bertha.
{13835}{13861}You don't smoke?
{13888}{13927}Sincewhen did you give it up?
{14055}{14116}You don't smoke either, Mr Gryce?
{14208}{14245}How stupid of me.
{14792}{14888}It was simply inhuman of Pragg|to go off now.
{14892}{14925}When I was in Tuxedo...
{14929}{15003}I asked a lot of people down and|I mislaid the list...
{15007}{15050}And I can't remember who's coming.
{15054}{15109}This week will be a failure too.
{15115}{15209}Judy, as if anybody's ever bored|at Bellmont.
{15214}{15238}Everything's gone wrong.
{15242}{15307}And now Bertha Dorset is|furious with me.
{15313}{15356}Furious with you? Why?
{15360}{15413}Because I told her Lawrence|Selden was coming, but...
{15418}{15492}hewouldn't after all and she's|unreasonable enough...
{15496}{15539}to believe it was my fault.
{15546}{15585}I thought thatwas all over.
{15590}{15643}Oh, so it is. On his side.
{15667}{15755}I shall call him on the telephone|and tell him he simply must come.
{15760}{15784}Oh, don't.
{15788}{15853}Good gracious, Lily.|Do you dislike him so much?
{15857}{15896}Not at all. I like him.
{15916}{15973}Oh, don't say there's|any real harm in Bertha...
{15979}{16075}but she delights in making people|miserable, especially her husband.
{16090}{16124}Poor George.
{16163}{16216}But she is dangerous.
{16244}{16285}And you are not nasty.
{16318}{16363}For always getting what she|wants...
{16368}{16433}commend me to a nastywoman.
{16446}{16497}l thought you were fond of Bertha.
{16505}{16535}Oh, I am.
{16540}{16626}It's much saferto be fond of|dangerous people.
{16823}{16895}Did you know his father made a|fortune...
{16900}{16994}out of inventing a device which|excludes fresh air from hotels?
{16999}{17021}Who?
{17025}{17082}Why to be sure, Lily.|Percy Gryce.
{17103}{17203}But he's horribly shy and|easily shocked...
{17208}{17251}Why don't you say it, Judy?
{17255}{17335}I have the reputation for being|on the hunt for a husband.
{17359}{17449}Lily, I asked him here|on purpose foryou.
{17472}{17552}Percy Gryce and I are becoming|very good friends.
{17586}{17684}You're sure you wouldn't like|me to telephone Lawrence Selden?
{17702}{17730}Quite sure.
{17832}{17885}I do enjoy the quiet.
{17936}{17970}Don't you, Lily?
{18097}{18148}I wish men would always stay away.
{18153}{18206}It's much nicerwithout them.
{18241}{18288}Oh, you don't count, George.
{18310}{18361}One never talks to one's husband.
{18377}{18434}But wives never like their husbands|talking to other women.
{18439}{18536}Only if the women in question are|slightly too eligible or divorced.
{18550}{18593}Wives may do as they wish.
{18604}{18700}Husbands are expected to be like|money, influential but silent.
{18718}{18800}If divorcees were more acceptable,|I might be tempted.
{18804}{18822}Gus! Oh dear.
{18886}{18939}You see, I came after all.
{19572}{19656}Thank you for keeping me from|playing bridge tonight, Mr Gryce.
{19660}{19697}Not at all, Miss Bart.
{19701}{19772}I have no head for the game or|the rules of betting.
{19776}{19825}I have been dragged into it|in the past...
{19829}{19884}and I have lost an appalling|amount of money.
{19914}{19944}Mr Gryce, I have shocked you.
{19948}{20038}Whilst I do not approve, Miss|Bart, I do approve of you.
{20050}{20093}I hope that means you forgive me.
{20103}{20142}For I am penitent.
{20333}{20374}Will you go to church tomorrow?
{20387}{20407}Yes.
{20424}{20475}May I accompany you, Miss Bart?
{20488}{20521}Of course, MrGryce.
{20590}{20614}Good night.
{20618}{20663}Good night, Miss Bart.
{22450}{22501}Dear me, am I late?
{22604}{22636}Late forwhat?
{22645}{22669}Late forwhom?
{22721}{22782}Perhaps you had an earlier|engagement?
{22802}{22832}Yes, I had.
{22864}{22911}Perhaps I am in theway then?
{23116}{23173}Mr Selden is at your disposal.
{23194}{23266}l never interferewith|Mr Selden's engagements.
{23276}{23333}But I have no engagement|with Mr Selden.
{23338}{23385}I was to go to church...
{23398}{23474}and I'm afraid that the carriages|have left without me.
{23484}{23525}Have they left, do you know?
{23536}{23604}Yes. I heard them drive away|some time ago.
{23682}{23729}Then I shall have towalk.
{23762}{23795}It's too late to get there.
{23801}{23872}Well, I'll have the credit for|trying at any rate.
{24883}{24924}You must be quite breathless.
{24975}{25005}How fast you walk.
{25010}{25049}Thought I'd never catch up.
{25054}{25111}But I've been sitting here|for nearly an hour!
{25120}{25158}Waiting for me, I hope.
{25167}{25216}Waiting to see ifyou'd come.
{25226}{25265}Weren't you sure I would?
{25269}{25320}If I waited long enough.
{25325}{25403}But I only had a limited time|to give to the experience.
{25408}{25434}Why ''limited''?
{25439}{25474}By my other engagement.
{25602}{25696}Now I see why you were|getting up on yourAmericana.
{25727}{25776}That's why I was waiting for you.
{25789}{25848}To thank you for giving me so many|points.
{25853}{25941}You can hardly dojustice to the|subject in so short a time.
{25947}{26000}Won't you devote the afternoon to|it?
{26015}{26085}We'll take a walk and you can|thank me at your leisure.
{26221}{26254}Let us sit here.
{26582}{26652}I have broken two engagements for|you today...
{26658}{26715}both of them with Percy Gryce.
{26746}{26789}How many have you broken for me?
{26818}{26838}None.
{26843}{26906}My only engagement at Bellmont|was with you.
{26963}{27016}You really came to Bellmont|to see me?
{27020}{27046}Of course I did.
{27067}{27089}Why?
{27117}{27174}l like to seewhat|you're doing.
{27178}{27231}You're such awonderful spectacle.
{27270}{27352}Well, now you're here, you can|see the effect first-hand.
{27357}{27410}I don't think that my coming...
{27415}{27476}has deflected your course of action|at all.
{27534}{27593}Give me one. I haven't smoked in|days.
{27598}{27651}Why such unnatural abstinence?
{27657}{27749}It is not considered becoming in a|'jeune fille a marier'.
{27756}{27799}And at the present moment...
{27804}{27867}I am a 'jeune fille a marier'.
{27965}{28018}You must suppose me a|dull kind of person...
{28022}{28063}If you think I never yield|to an impulse.
{28067}{28104}But I don't suppose that.
{28109}{28193}Your genius lies in converting|impulses into intentions.
{28211}{28241}My genius?
{28278}{28333}My genius would appear to be my|ability...
{28338}{28402}to do the wrong thing|at the right time.
{28408}{28441}Or vice-versa.
{28559}{28625}Is there any final test of genius|but success?
{28660}{28705}I certainly haven't succeeded.
{28710}{28775}But you will marry|someone very rich.
{28792}{28859}What a miserable future you foresee|for me.
{28881}{28928}Haven't you seen it for yourself?
{28941}{28965}Of course.
{29016}{29098}But it seems so much darker when|you show it to me.
{29200}{29237}Why do you do this to me?
{29283}{29380}Why do you make the things that l|have chosen seem hateful to me...
{29398}{29455}if you have nothing|to give me instead?
{29484}{29545}No. I have nothing to give you.
{29603}{29669}If I had, it'd be yours,|you know that.
{29711}{29813}But you belittle me, being so sure|they're the only things I care for.
{29882}{29981}Isn't it natural for me to belittle|everything I can't offer you?
{30268}{30307}Do you want to marry me?
{30403}{30464}No, I don't.
{30572}{30650}But perhaps I should|ifyou did.
{30736}{30781}It would be a great risk.
{30828}{30892}I've never concealed how great.
{31200}{31235}You are a coward.
{31247}{31269}No.
{31316}{31361}It's you who are the coward.
{31682}{31716}Are you serious?
{31765}{31789}Why not?
{31822}{31873}i took no risk in being so.
{32254}{32307}Why is it that when we meet...
{32340}{32416}we always play this|elaborate game?
{32536}{32570}It's getting late.
{32606}{32639}Let us go down.
{32856}{32922}l thought Mr Gryce meant|to stay all week.
{32926}{32975}He did, that's the worst of it.
{32979}{33051}It shows he's running away|from you.
{33056}{33117}Bertha's done her work and|poisoned him.
{33135}{33196}What was it Bertha really|told Percy?
{33200}{33239}Don't ask me. Horrors.
{33281}{33359}All I can say is, Lily, that l|can't make you out.
{33366}{33421}He's not completely lost.
{33427}{33459}There are ways.
{33463}{33522}Whatever you do, do nothing.
{33569}{33655}Lily, you'll never do anything|if you're not serious.
{33725}{33753}Out of spirits?
{33769}{33801}I'm a little dull.
{33807}{33871}Is your last box of Doucet|dresses a failure...
{33875}{33940}ordid my wife rook you for|everything at bridge?
{33945}{34035}I have to give up Doucet|dresses and bridge.
{34040}{34101}I can't afford either any more.
{34109}{34158}And Judy thinks me a bore.
{34191}{34242}Fact is, she's angry with me.
{34246}{34328}Angrywith you? Nonsense.|Mywife's devoted to you.
{34333}{34423}She's my very best friend, and|that's why I mind vexing her.
{34446}{34493}I want to make my peace with her.
{34512}{34575}She has her heart set on my|marrying money.
{34593}{34629}Agreat deal of money.
{34638}{34679}You don't mean Percy Gryce?
{34697}{34721}Good Lord.
{34726}{34781}How could Judy think you'd|do such a thing?
{34798}{34837}Sometimes I think a man...
{34842}{34918}understands a woman's motives|betterthan herown sex does.
{34925}{34986}Good Lord. I could've|told Judy that.
{35020}{35050}Oh, by the way, Miss Lily...
{35054}{35118}I wish you'd try to persuade|Judy to be civil to Rosedale.
{35122}{35190}I did a neat stroke of business|through him lastweek.
{35194}{35249}If she'd only ask him to come|and dine now and then...
{35253}{35304}I'd get almost anything out of him.
{35348}{35411}He's going to be richer than|all of us one ofthese days.
{35559}{35604}Would you do me a favour?
{35635}{35672}A very great favour?
{35681}{35707}Why, of course.
{35718}{35777}I don't mean to bore you with all|this...
{35782}{35847}but I'm entirely dependent on my|aunt...
{35866}{35950}and though she's very kind,|she gives me no regular allowance.
{35973}{36051}I have a tiny income of my own|but it's been badly invested.
{36070}{36131}Seems to bring in less each year.
{36150}{36224}And recently I've lost money at|cards.
{36228}{36293}I've paid off my debts,|ofcourse, but...
{36318}{36371}I dare not tell my aunt.
{36397}{36475}I can no longergo on living my|present life.
{36501}{36546}And Percy Gryce?
{36563}{36616}I can't make that sort of marriage.
{36632}{36726}You gave him the sack, and that's|why he left by train this morning?
{36806}{36925}I can make you a handsome sum|without endangering your capital.
{36952}{37007}I am so ignorant about money|matters...
{37011}{37101}and I'd be so grateful to|have a good advisor.
{37120}{37150}Leave it to me.
{37158}{37195}I'll find a solution.
{37330}{37362}Really, Lily...
{37377}{37455}you're as careless and frivolous|as your poor parents were.
{37471}{37520}Why do you go to Bellmont...
{37525}{37576}if you don't rememberwhat happened|orwhom you saw there.
{37589}{37628}But therewas no one new.
{37633}{37678}Just the usual throng.
{37688}{37731}Was Mr Selden there?
{37740}{37793}Yes. He came later.
{37806}{37869}And Mr Rosedale,|was he there?
{37873}{37901}No, of course not.
{37918}{37948}Why do you ask?
{37966}{38013}Passing interest, merely.
{38035}{38113}Mr Selden tells me that socially|Mr Rosedale...
{38117}{38158}is very ubiquitous now.
{38167}{38228}I have always thought that|men like Rosedale...
{38233}{38282}and their methods of gaining|fortunes...
{38286}{38357}were at best, questionable,|at worst, criminal.
{38364}{38388}To grow richer...
{38392}{38480}at a time when most people's|investments are shrinking...
{38484}{38527}strikes me as very bad taste.
{38531}{38596}But society still uses such men,|ifonly obliquely.
{38600}{38703}If obliquity were a vice|we should all be tainted.
{38709}{38810}Only someonewithout family could|make such a vulgar remark.
{38817}{38903}Aunt Julia, you are my family.
{39529}{39561}Just as I thought.
{39586}{39668}Extraordinary that I can't teach|the parlour-maid...
{39673}{39718}to draw the blinds down evenly.
{39723}{39772}Will you see to it, Grace?
{39780}{39848}Jennings, we'll take tea|in the upstairs sitting room.
{39860}{39909}Lily, you read me the obituaries.
{39941}{40010}Aunt Julia, Grace does it|so much better than me.
{40028}{40124}She can make the most insignificant|death seem interesting.
{40186}{40222}I'll see to the blinds.
{40226}{40283}Verywell, you mayjoin us later.
{42475}{42528}It's a Mrs Haffen, Miss.
{42535}{42588}Shewon't say what she wants.
{42678}{42716}You want to see me?
{42736}{42791}Something you might like to see.
{42816}{42857}You have something belonging to me?
{42899}{42929}Not exactly.
{42969}{42997}I don't understand.
{43002}{43053}If it's not mine,|then why are you here?
{43084}{43133}When I worked at the Benedick...
{43149}{43216}I was in charge of cleaning the|gentlemen's rooms.
{43253}{43335}Most gentlemen are careful about|the letters they get.
{43341}{43429}Burn them in winter, tear them|into bits in summer.
{43473}{43561}But Mr Selden wasn't|so particular.
{43666}{43711}I know nothing ofthese letters.
{43727}{43794}I have no idea why you've|brought them here.
{43825}{43857}To sell them.
{43901}{43977}I saw you coming out of|Mr Selden's rooms.
{44021}{44088}So I guessed they were worth|more to you than me.
{44547}{44586}You promised me we'd meet...
{44591}{44634}when George was away from town.
{44639}{44700}Although you've forbidden me|to come to you, I will.
{44705}{44760}I cannot bear George near me.
{44765}{44808}If he touches me I want to scream.
{44813}{44872}His very presence is unbearable.
{45008}{45105}My darling Lawrence, you are|my consolation, my only joy.
{45136}{45233}In you I find more freedom and|support than I've ever known.
{45248}{45295}Your devoted Bertha.
{45444}{45497}What do you want for them?
{45540}{45581}One hundred and fifty.
{45590}{45622}One hundred.
{45635}{45671}I've got to live too.
{45675}{45769}I've offered you all that I'm|prepared to pay for the letters.
{45865}{45893}One hundred.
{46702}{46755}If you would forgive your enemy...
{46789}{46848}first inflict a hurt on them.
{47334}{47364}Oh, Bertha.
{47415}{47480}How could you have been so|indiscreet.
{47578}{47637}l now pronounce you man and wife.
{47871}{47922}Never seen you look more lovely.
{47934}{47964}Oh, Gus.
{47986}{48031}Lily, I've got a cheque for you.
{48109}{48137}Another dividend?
{48143}{48212}You have both Rosedale and me|to thank for it.
{48216}{48284}I've made you five thousand|on his tip...
{48288}{48357}And re-invested four|on your behalf.
{48361}{48416}With promise ofanother big rise.
{48420}{48440}Well...
{48445}{48498}I can't thank you properly now.
{48503}{48597}I don't want to be thanked. I want|you to be nice to Rosedale and me.
{48601}{48652}I'd like to see you now and then.
{48656}{48699}Come on overto Bellmont.
{48703}{48731}I'll send the motor.
{48736}{48781}You say the most absurd things.
{48792}{48835}Besides, it's impossible.
{48841}{48880}My aunt is back in town...
{48884}{48925}and I must stay with her.
{48954}{49007}You must come...
{49012}{49073}to see Mrs Peniston and l|next time you are in town.
{49083}{49173}Then you can tell me how to better|invest my small fortune.
{49628}{49667}This is luck.
{49681}{49752}I was wondering if I'd be able|to have aword with you.
{49781}{49834}I haven't recovered my self-|respect...
{49839}{49898}since you showed me how poor|my ambitions were.
{49914}{49944}On the contrary...
{49948}{49985}I thought I had been|the means of proving...
{49989}{50042}they were more important to you|than anything else.
{50063}{50081}Lily.
{50097}{50138}We thought you'd given us the slip.
{50143}{50186}Been hunting all overfor you.
{50205}{50256}I wanted to invite you to my box...
{50261}{50316}at the opera|on opening night.
{50329}{50399}Gus has promised to come|to town on purpose.
{50417}{50458}He's a tremendous admirerof yours.
{50463}{50560}I fancy he'd go a lot farther for|the pleasure of seeing you.
{50573}{50622}The Trenors are my best friends.
{50626}{50692}l think we'd all go a long way|to see one other.
{50736}{50806}How's your luck been|lately on Wall street?
{50818}{50900}I hear Gus pulled off a nice|little pile foryou last month.
{50917}{50964}I had a little money to invest...
{50969}{51043}and Mr Trenor has been helping me|in such matters.
{51054}{51097}I had a lucky turn.
{51101}{51136}Is that what you call it?
{51158}{51217}You've had a great many yourself.
{51265}{51365}Is that the latest creation of the|dressmaker at the Benedick?
{51369}{51412}If so, it's a great success.
{51425}{51458}Isn't it, MrSelden?
{51531}{51564}That's nice of you.
{51577}{51665}It'd be nicer still ifyou'd|get me a glass of lemonade.
{51700}{51726}Pleasure.
{52120}{52173}They met six weeks ago at Bertha|Dorset's...
{52179}{52226}and have been devoted ever since.
{52231}{52290}The engagement's to be|announced next week.
{52308}{52394}They say it'll be the nicest|marriage possible.
{52407}{52468}One dull fortune|marrying another.
{52564}{52623}Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce?
{52662}{52690}Well, well.
{52973}{53003}Ladies and gentlemen...
{53028}{53106}Miss Lily Bart, as 'summer'|byWatteau.
{53412}{53461}She's never looked so radiant.
{53500}{53559}l like her best in that simple|dress.
{53584}{53637}Makes her look like the real Lily.
{53665}{53700}The Lily I know.
{53711}{53741}The Lilywe know.
{53751}{53804}She's herselfwith a few people|only.
{53827}{53903}She has it in her to become|whatever she's believed to be.
{53919}{53976}We must think the best of her.
{54003}{54036}I'll tell her that.
{54080}{54127}She always says you dislike her.
{54146}{54224}Well, Grace. How's life at|Richfield?
{54245}{54267}Quiet.
{54285}{54336}Aunt Peniston sees very little|company.
{54341}{54394}I'm sure your being there|gave her much pleasure.
{54404}{54469}I am as reliable|as roast mutton.
{54546}{54585}But Aunt Julia is not alone...
{54589}{54652}in preferring Lily's|erratic brilliance.
{54656}{54691}You should marry, Grace.
{54719}{54774}We should all marry,|MrSelden.
{54888}{54929}You never speak to me.
{54964}{55017}I'm never near you enough.
{55488}{55535}You think hard things of me.
{55604}{55638}l think of you...
{55670}{55703}at any rate.
{55845}{55900}Why do we never see each other?
{55987}{56036}I have my law practice and...
{56065}{56137}you're always surrounded|by admirers.
{56192}{56257}There's no admirers at my aunt's.
{56363}{56387}Well...
{56417}{56499}then, perhaps I might take|tea with you.
{56518}{56584}At Mrs Peniston's|next week?
{56607}{56627}Yes.
{56709}{56752}Come at four on Friday.
{56797}{56832}Then we can talk.
{56887}{56934}I've so much to say to you.
{57038}{57077}I need your help.
{57141}{57192}You promised me once you'd help me.
{57274}{57325}The only way I can help you...
{57368}{57407}is by loving you.
{58652}{58680}Love me.
{58759}{58796}But don't tell me so.
{59887}{59926}I'd hate to miss the train.
{59931}{59976}Selden, going too?
{59980}{60027}-Aren't you staying for supper?|-No.
{60033}{60100}When people crowd their rooms so|you can't get nearanyone...
{60104}{60151}you wish to speak to I'd sooner go.
{60170}{60215}My wife was right to stay away.
{60222}{60302}She says life is too short to spend|it breaking new people in.
{60307}{60331}Thank you.
{62192}{62241}Lily and Gus Trenor, you say?
{62248}{62289}Aunt, of course I don't mean...
{62294}{62339}Then what do you mean, Grace?
{62351}{62402}Do people say he's in love with|her?
{62407}{62464}People always say|unpleasant things.
{62509}{62581}It's a pity, though, that Lily|makes herself so conspicuous.
{62586}{62614}Conspicuous?
{62641}{62696}Does he mean to divorce|then marry her?
{62700}{62722}No, it's...
{62732}{62758}it's a flirtation.
{62763}{62789}Nothing more.
{62793}{62819}A flirtation?
{62832}{62871}With a married man?
{62889}{62950}Such things were never heard of in|my day.
{63359}{63389}Look here, Lily...
{63393}{63459}Judy and I've been in town for|weeks. When am I going to see you?
{63464}{63521}You can find me any afternoon|at my aunt's.
{63536}{63591}Come see me there and|we can have a quiet talk.
{63603}{63656}You put me offwith that at the|Van Osburgh wedding.
{63662}{63748}Truth is, now you've got what you|wanted you'd rather not see me.
{63752}{63787}Don't be foolish, Gus.
{63791}{63848}If you want to see me|you can come to my aunt's.
{64042}{64083}What else is being said?
{64147}{64214}That Gus Trenor pays her bills.
{64218}{64236}Rubbish.
{64248}{64284}Lily has herown income.
{64289}{64336}And I provide for her handsomely.
{64342}{64387}There are hergambling debts.
{64409}{64442}What do you mean?
{64468}{64511}She plays bridge.
{64545}{64633}Who told you my niece plays|cards for money?
{64638}{64730}Mrs Gryce told me that it|was Lily's gambling debts...
{64735}{64765}that frightened Percy.
{64778}{64858}In fact people are inclined to|excuse her on that account.
{64862}{64901}Excuse herforwhat?
{64963}{65047}Foraccepting the attentions of|men like Gus Trenor.
{65142}{65189}Thank you fortelling me, Grace.
{65211}{65274}But I must say, this unwelcome|information...
{65278}{65331}has ruined the Mozart for me.
{65407}{65481}Lily, let's leave before the first|act starts.
{65485}{65554}Judy's as cross as two sticks when|she's away from Bellmont.
{65558}{65588}Come to the house now.
{65592}{65628}Is Judy unwell?
{65632}{65687}A visit from you might be just|what's needed.
{65765}{65799}Very well, Gus.
{65812}{65842}I shall come with you.
{66945}{67014}Doesn't it look as if we're waiting|for the body to be brought down?
{67100}{67128}Where's Judy?
{67190}{67241}She's not up to seeing anybody.
{67301}{67366}You mean to say she's not well|enough to see me?
{67384}{67408}Devil of a headache.
{67426}{67463}Quite knocked out by it.
{67482}{67554}In that case, will you have the|goodness to call me a cab?
{67567}{67603}Why must you go?
{67627}{67678}It's late and we are alone.
{67719}{67758}I must insist.
{67777}{67832}Always the same old story.
{67855}{67933}Can't give me five minutes but|you're charming to others.
{68012}{68071}I only went to that stupid|opera to be with you.
{68076}{68127}I insist that you call me a cab.
{68158}{68195}Suppose I won't?
{68206}{68234}What then?
{68250}{68311}If you force me I shall|go upstairs to Judy.
{68388}{68412}Sit down.
{68419}{68455}I've got aword to say to you.
{68484}{68574}If you have anything to say to me|you must say it at another time.
{68586}{68683}I shall go upstairs to Judy unless|you call me a cab at once.
{68708}{68772}Go upstairs, Judy isn't there.
{68841}{68896}You mean to say that Judy|is not in this house?
{68901}{68940}She isn't even in town.
{68946}{68972}I don't believe you.
{68977}{69011}My wife's still at Bellmont.
{69015}{69066}If she were not coming to town|she would have telephoned.
{69070}{69086}She did.
{69090}{69123}I received no message.
{69127}{69162}I didn't send any.
{69167}{69226}How dare you compromise me in this|way?
{69231}{69282}Don't take that high tone with me.
{69292}{69343}I've been patient long enough.
{69352}{69380}After all...
{69385}{69465}if you pay for the dinner you're|allowed to sit at the table.
{69469}{69510}I don't know what you mean.
{69546}{69587}I didn't begin this business.
{69591}{69621}Kept out ofthe way.
{69625}{69680}But I can see fast enough when|I'm being made a fool of.
{69704}{69798}Nowyou've got what you wanted,|Gus isn't needed any more.
{69803}{69848}Well that isn't playing fair, Lily.
{69853}{69902}It's dodging the rules of the game.
{69917}{69958}And now you've got to pay.
{69962}{70021}You mean I owe you money?
{70048}{70099}You told me it was all right.
{70119}{70158}It was all right. It is all right.
{70163}{70204}You're welcome to it. All of it.
{70213}{70266}I just want to be thanked a little.
{70270}{70304}I have thanked you!
{70348}{70403}Or do you wish for payment in kind?
{70467}{70485}No!
{70515}{70593}If I owe you money, I'll pay you!
{70627}{70678}You owe me nine thousand dollars.
{70783}{70807}Nine thousand?
{71003}{71025}I will pay you.
{71040}{71107}I suppose you'll go to Selden or|Rosedale for it.
{71125}{71186}Unless you've settled those|scores already...
{71191}{71240}and I'm the only one left out|in the cold.
{71288}{71337}What more do you have to say to me?
{71407}{71429}Go home.
{72329}{72363}Come here Lily.
{72369}{72414}I wish to speak to you.
{72442}{72516}Ant Julia, it's very late|and I am very tired.
{72520}{72577}I must insist, Lily.
{73010}{73049}You're a bad colour, Lily.
{73133}{73221}This incessant rushing about is|beginning to tell on you.
{73404}{73445}I don't think it's that.
{73583}{73630}I've had otherworries.
{73778}{73808}The fact is...
{73854}{73890}I owe some money.
{73968}{73986}I...
{74032}{74067}I've been foolish.
{74139}{74186}There are bills that are pressing.
{74206}{74280}I paid your dressmaker's bill|last October.
{74286}{74370}But if you owe Madame Celeste|anotherthousand dollars...
{74375}{74426}She may send me youraccount.
{74475}{74547}It's a good deal more than that.
{74564}{74613}A good deal more?
{74640}{74662}Towhom?
{74675}{74713}Do I knowthese people?
{74717}{74789}Some by name,|others by reputation.
{74799}{74848}Then they're of no consequence.
{74853}{74912}These debts I speak of|are different.
{74942}{74970}The fact is...
{75023}{75076}I've been playing cards.
{75081}{75111}It's true then?
{75142}{75193}You play cards for money?
{75217}{75262}Do you play on Sundays?
{75269}{75326}You're hard on me, Aunt Julia.
{75340}{75391}l never really cared for cards...
{75395}{75446}and one hates to be thought|priggish and one...
{75451}{75494}drifts into doing what others do.
{75592}{75649}I've had a dreadful lesson.
{75714}{75777}If you help me out, I promise...
{75781}{75820}You needn't make any promises.
{75825}{75855}It's unnecessary.
{75870}{75909}When I offered you a home...
{75913}{75979}I didn't undertake to pay|your gambling debts.
{75997}{76062}Aunt Julia, you mean|that you won't help me?
{76066}{76134}I shall certainly not do anything|to give the impression...
{76138}{76176}that I countenance your behaviour.
{76180}{76233}Aunt Julia, I will be disgraced!
{76247}{76339}I consider that you are|disgraced, Lily.
{76430}{76485}And now I must ask you to leave me.
{76525}{76592}This scene has been|extremely painful to me...
{76604}{76692}and I have my own health|to consider.
{76988}{77097}And tell Jennings I wish to see no-|one until tomorrow afternoon.
{77111}{77168}And then only Grace Stepney.
{77189}{77209}Grace?
{77310}{77338}Yes, Aunt Julia.
{78244}{78285}Lily, it's after midnight.
{78290}{78327}What will Aunt Julia think?
{78352}{78378}I don't care.
{78420}{78461}I couldn't go to my room.
{78511}{78537}I hate it so.
{78691}{78744}Lily, what's happened?
{78784}{78818}Can't you tell me?
{78835}{78898}l thought I could|manage my own life...
{78960}{79015}But I've been so foolish, Grace.
{79033}{79090}To the point of being compromised.
{79118}{79144}Bywhom?
{79178}{79211}Mr Selden?
{79238}{79302}No, not Mr Selden.
{79401}{79473}I've been careless and imprudent|about money.
{79566}{79636}I'm frightened to think what I owe.
{79793}{79832}Grace, you know Lawrence.
{79882}{79933}If I asked him to help me...
{79948}{79984}told him why...
{80036}{80108}would he loathe me if I told|him everything?
{80131}{80153}No.
{80174}{80208}You must not do that.
{80256}{80301}He is like other men.
{80360}{80434}They have minds like moral|fly-paper.
{80454}{80556}They can forgive a woman almost|anything except losing her name.
{80583}{80661}If you wish to keep your|reputation intact, Lily...
{80702}{80739}tell him nothing.
{80747}{80816}But he must've spoken about me.
{80870}{80917}What does he really think of me?
{80981}{81026}We've never discussed you, Lily.
{81078}{81143}I have no ideawhat|Mr Selden thinks.
{81206}{81259}But I must trust in his good faith.
{81331}{81396}I'll write him and ask him to come.
{81684}{81723}Goodnight, Grace.
{81771}{81806}Goodnight, Lily.
{82129}{82157}Lawrence!
{82241}{82267}Lawrence!
{83171}{83232}Jennings. Is my aunt downstairs?
{83236}{83266}No, Miss Bart.
{83277}{83369}Mrs Peniston left for Richfield|early this morning...
{83374}{83406}with Miss Stepney.
{83468}{83490}Thank you.
{83558}{83644}Would you see that the boy delivers|this to Mr Selden at the Benedick?
{83648}{83672}Yes, Miss.
{83676}{83719}Would you serve tea at four...
{83723}{83799}in the downstairs sitting room and|show Mr Selden in when he arrives?
{83804}{83830}Yes, Miss Bart.
{83835}{83843}Thank you.
{84912}{84938}Mr Rosedale.
{85200}{85237}Pretty well done.
{85391}{85428}Yes, very well done.
{85677}{85724}Why put up this kind of bluff?
{85754}{85797}Why aren't you straight with me?
{85893}{85975}l know there have been times|when you've been worried.
{86002}{86061}A girl like you shouldn't have|worries.
{86093}{86150}You're quite right, Mr Rosedale.
{86172}{86211}I have had worries.
{86240}{86295}I've been careless about money.
{86344}{86436}I'm offering you the chance to turn|your back on that once and for all.
{86488}{86543}I know you're not in love with me.
{86566}{86607}You're not even fond of me.
{86636}{86658}Yet.
{86759}{86822}I'm very much flattered by your|offer...
{86864}{86921}but I should be selfish and|ungrateful...
{86925}{87003}if I made my reason for accepting|your generosity financial.
{87059}{87092}Miss Bart...
{87110}{87169}I generally get what|I want in life.
{87194}{87294}I have a certain social position|and the means to maintain it.
{87313}{87360}Now all I want is the woman...
{87382}{87468}the right woman, to share both|with me.
{87507}{87606}You're fond of luxury and amusement|and to not have to settle for it.
{87640}{87681}I can provide the style...
{87695}{87763}and the means of settling.
{87826}{87871}You're mistaken on one point...
{87877}{87911}Mr Rosedale.
{87946}{87985}Whatever I enjoy...
{87995}{88040}I'm prepared to pay for.
{88274}{88331}I have spoken too plainly.
{88339}{88384}I didn't mean to give offence.
{88388}{88437}Give me time to consider your|kindness.
{88453}{88488}Goodbye, Miss Bart.
{88509}{88556}You will consider my proposal?
{88565}{88589}Of course.
{89518}{89536}Yes?
{89540}{89578}Are you alone, Lily?
{89586}{89662}Yes, quite alone, Bertha.
{89683}{89721}Everyone has gone away.
{89741}{89812}My aunt to Richfield,|everyone else to Europe.
{89816}{89886}Except Lawrence Selden, who's gone|to London.
{89890}{89937}How unsophisticated of him.
{89941}{90010}Will you join us then on a cruise|to the Mediterranean?
{90021}{90074}Well, I'm not sure I'm able to.
{90078}{90121}You'll be doing me a great service.
{90125}{90172}You're always good with George...
{90177}{90255}listening to the stories he's been|telling since the Civil War.
{90260}{90309}You're the only one with enough|fortitude to take an interest.
{90313}{90337}Nonsense.
{90341}{90386}George can be charming.
{90390}{90431}Good. You'll come then?
{90436}{90491}Yes. It'll be delightful.
{90523}{90547}Goodbye.
{95157}{95187}MrSelden.
{95193}{95225}Mrs Fisher.
{95240}{95275}Dojoin us.
{95312}{95353}What brings you to Monte Carlo?
{95357}{95418}I finished my business with a|client in London...
{95422}{95512}and decided to come down and renew|my objective interest in life.
{95517}{95576}So you're not so far removed from|being manipulated...
{95581}{95642}by the strings of society|as one might think.
{95646}{95699}Mrs Fisher, none of us are.
{95774}{95848}We're starving to death because we|can't decide where to lunch.
{95853}{95922}One gets the best things at ''The|Terrasse''...
{95940}{95997}but all the Americans go there now.
{96079}{96126}I do believe the Dorsets are back.
{96180}{96213}It's their yacht...
{96232}{96262}"The Sabrina"
{96280}{96308}Oh, yes.
{96443}{96550}I often have this strange and|vivid dream...
{96563}{96649}of an unknown woman|whom I love and who loves me...
{96656}{96717}and who, each time,|is neither exactly the same...
{96739}{96815}nor exactly different but|who loves me and understand me.
{96820}{96904}For she understands me and|my heart is transparent...
{96910}{96998}to her alone, alasl|Which ceases to be a problem...
{97004}{97104}to her alone, and the sweat|of my pale brow.
{97109}{97199}She alone knows|how to cool it with tears.
{97219}{97324}Is she brunette,|blonde or red-head?
{97405}{97448}He's reading Verlaine to her now.
{97487}{97515}In French.
{98256}{98340}What's the use of mincing matters?
{98350}{98416}We all know what Bertha brought|Lily abroad for.
{98420}{98486}The Silverton affair is|at the acute stage.
{98490}{98541}George needs to be distracted.
{98545}{98614}And I'm sure Lily distracts him.
{98630}{98695}A clever woman would know when|to play her cards right.
{98706}{98771}But she's never been clever in|that way.
{98780}{98833}I hope there hasn't been|a row.
{99306}{99338}Where the devil are they?
{99402}{99420}Bertha!
{99451}{99477}Bertha!
{100608}{100661}How did you find London,|Mr Selden?
{100684}{100729}More agreeable than NewYork?
{100733}{100761}In someways, yes.
{100767}{100822}Nevertheless, I came to see you.
{100827}{100851}To see me?
{100862}{100907}Or to see an older friend?
{100914}{100959}I beg you to leave the yacht.
{100963}{100989}To leave?
{101005}{101035}Why? What has happened?
{101040}{101122}Nothing. But if something should,|why be in the way of it?
{101135}{101184}How do you think I'd leave Bertha?
{101195}{101248}You have yourself to think of now.
{101291}{101326}Nothing will happen.
{101363}{101408}Of course not. I'm sure.
{101781}{101805}Have you seen Bertha?
{101814}{101830}No.
{101847}{101880}Is she not up yet?
{101894}{101914}Not up yet!
{101946}{101978}Has she gone to bed?
{102003}{102056}You know what time she came|aboard this morning?
{102062}{102090}At seven!
{102099}{102125}Seven?
{102132}{102162}Was there an accident?
{102167}{102210}There was no accident.
{102215}{102254}I waited for them all night.
{102277}{102338}Why didn't you call me|to share your vigil?
{102358}{102413}You wouldn't have liked the|denouement.
{102430}{102458}The denouement?
{102477}{102551}Isn't that too big a word for|such a small incident?
{102556}{102574}Don't!
{102637}{102659}Don't!
{102703}{102744}I only want to help you.
{102773}{102842}You do so by being sweet|and patientwith me.
{102848}{102899}You can't want to see me|ridiculous.
{102947}{103025}If it hadn't been for you I'd|have ended it long ago.
{103086}{103118}I'll go to see Selden.
{103123}{103143}No!
{103183}{103203}No.
{103227}{103253}Why not?
{103275}{103326}One lawyer is as good as another.
{103386}{103408}Very well.
{103426}{103473}Go and see Mr Selden then.
{103532}{103589}You'll have time before dinner.
{104088}{104139}I ought to say good morning.
{104206}{104267}l tried to see you but|you weren't up.
{104281}{104326}No. I got to bed late.
{104380}{104452}Afterwe separated during the|fete, we thoughtwe should wait...
{104457}{104496}butwe missed you.
{104526}{104561}You missed us?
{104574}{104644}But I thought you didn't get back|to the yacht until this morning.
{104689}{104727}Who told you that?
{104732}{104754}George.
{104829}{104862}Is that his version?
{104952}{104980}Poor George.
{105017}{105064}He's had one of his attacks again.
{105104}{105157}It's very bad for him to be|worried.
{105161}{105241}Anything upsetting always brings|on an attack.
{105268}{105319}''Anything upsetting''?
{105342}{105364}Yes.
{105381}{105434}Such as having you so|conspicuously on his hands...
{105439}{105492}during the small hours.
{105539}{105621}You know, my dear, you're|rather a responsibility...
{105626}{105685}in such a scandalous place after|midnight.
{105705}{105727}Well really...
{105743}{105823}considering you burdened him with|that responsibility.
{105905}{105987}A married man should not have the|burden of being seen alone...
{105991}{106027}with a single woman.
{106051}{106094}Yes, we were alone.
{106103}{106142}Is that so dreadful?
{106158}{106248}After all, we lost you as much|as you mislaid us.
{106354}{106395}So now it is my fault...
{106399}{106469}for not having the superhuman|cleverness to find you...
{106473}{106514}in that dreadful crowd?
{106519}{106562}Or the imagination to believe...
{106566}{106664}that you wouldn't wait for us on|the quay until we met you?
{106668}{106734}No, simply by us|all keeping together!
{106792}{106824}''Keeping together''?
{106867}{106937}Lily, you are not a child|to be led by the hand.
{106956}{106995}Nor to be lectured, Bertha.
{107039}{107067}Lecture you?
{107127}{107157}Heaven forbid.
{107175}{107238}I was merely trying to give you|a friendly hint.
{107312}{107379}It's usually the other way round.|I'm expected to take hints...
{107383}{107428}not to give them.
{107506}{107526}Hints?
{107549}{107575}From me to you?
{107610}{107657}Negative ones merely.
{107691}{107763}What not to be or to do|or to see.
{107798}{107897}But if you'll let me say so...
{107924}{107983}I didn't knowone of my negative|duties...
{107987}{108083}was not to warn you when you took|your imprudence too far.
{109018}{109053}Did you see George today?
{109069}{109089}Yes.
{109114}{109144}Well...
{109151}{109181}What happened?
{109196}{109226}What will happen?
{109241}{109278}Nothing, as yet.
{109298}{109341}And nothing in the future.
{109365}{109393}You're sure?
{109399}{109467}I'm not sure, but I'm|a good deal surer.
{109474}{109498}No, thank you.
{109539}{109594}Assume everything|is as usual.
{109989}{110042}Before I go I want to|leave you the Brys.
{110057}{110110}Charming ofyou to remember me.
{110115}{110135}What you really mean is...
{110140}{110201}that you've snubbed the Brys|and you know they know it.
{110206}{110224}Carry!
{110229}{110274}If you'd have even managed to|have them invited...
{110278}{110304}onto "The Sabrina" once.
{110308}{110353}Especially when royalty was|coming.
{110436}{110506}Stay over and I'll get the|Duchess to dine with them.
{110510}{110546}I shan't stay over.
{110550}{110638}The Gormers have paid for|my salon-lit and I leave tonight.
{110643}{110675}But get her to dine with them all|the same.
{110741}{110790}I've danced all my life, you're my|husband.
{110802}{110845}They'd be much obliged.
{111496}{111524}Do you sing?
{111542}{111570}Really?
{111694}{111735}Lily, if you're offto the yacht.
{111829}{111890}Miss Bart is not returning to the|yacht.
{111982}{112006}Bertha...
{112088}{112118}Miss Bart...
{112130}{112169}there's been a misunderstanding.
{112213}{112245}Some mistake.
{112296}{112324}Miss Bart...
{112333}{112368}remains here.
{112502}{112602}And I think, George, we'd better|not detain our guests any longer.
{112698}{112749}I have some business to attend|to...
{112754}{112824}and it's easier for me to remain|ashore forthe night.
{112939}{112998}Mr Selden, you promised to see me|to my cab.
{113064}{113103}Do you know of a quiet hotel?
{113108}{113159}To go to alone? lmpossible.
{113163}{113220}Well, it's too wet to sleep|outside.
{113259}{113304}There must be someone you can go|to.
{113309}{113329}At this hour?
{113334}{113381}God, ifyou'd only listened to me.
{113385}{113401}Not now.
{113407}{113456}You must go immediately to the|Stepneys.
{113461}{113537}I can't. You mustn't ask me to.|You don't know Gwen.
{113542}{113593}Come, you must appear to have gone|there directly.
{113597}{113619}What if she refuses?
{113624}{113663}Shewon't. Trust me.
{113828}{113875}I, Julia Grace Peniston...
{113879}{113953}being of sound|mind and body...
{113957}{114016}declare this to be my last|will and testament...
{114021}{114097}hereby revoking and declaring|utterly void...
{114101}{114195}all wills and clauses of wills|here to fore made by me.
{114224}{114312}It is my will and desire that,|after my death...
{114318}{114406}all my just debts shall be|paid by my executive...
{114410}{114469}here in after named.
{114519}{114597}Second, it is my will and|desire...
{114634}{114681}Lily will get everything, of|course.
{114690}{114749}Aunt Julia was always|a just woman.
{114756}{114838}Well, it's only about four hundred|thousand.
{114845}{114937}Eight. And to my niece,|Miss Lily Bart...
{114949}{115027}l bequeath the sum of ten thousand|dollars.
{115094}{115184}Nine. And the residue|of my estate...
{115191}{115240}l bequeath to my dear niece...
{115260}{115311}Grace Julia Stepney.
{115330}{115371}Given under my hand and seal...
{115377}{115443}22nd May 1906.
{115800}{115833}My dear Grace.
{115864}{115897}I am so glad.
{116474}{116521}What sweet shall we have today?
{116526}{116546}Lily!
{116557}{116587}My dear Carry,...
{116592}{116653}you wouldn't let the head waiter|see I've nothing to live on...
{116657}{116696}but my Aunt Julia's legacy?
{116704}{116751}Think of Bertha Dorset's|satisfaction...
{116756}{116838}if she came and found us lunching|on cold mutton and tea.
{116844}{116913}I was horrid to you in Monte|Carlo, Lily.
{116917}{116951}I'm ashamed of myself...
{116955}{117031}and I've wanted to tell you so|ever since, and that's the truth.
{117044}{117077}Well, what is truth?
{117097}{117185}Where a woman is concerned it's a|story that's easiest to believe.
{117206}{117278}If I'd have got the money,|no-one would dare ignore me.
{117283}{117357}And if they did, it wouldn't|matter. I'd be independent.
{117373}{117393}Lily.
{117406}{117434}It's so unjust.
{117439}{117517}Grace Stepney must feel she has no|right to that inheritance.
{117526}{117626}Anyone who knew how to please Aunt|Julia has a right to her money.
{117630}{117662}But she was devoted to you.
{117681}{117711}Be honest, Carry.
{117717}{117762}She disapproved of my going with|the Dorsets...
{117766}{117832}and she heard of my break|with them.
{117836}{117904}After all, Bertha did|turn me off the yacht.
{117953}{118021}I must know where I stand,|Carry.
{118051}{118102}And know what's being said of me.
{118155}{118183}I don't listen.
{118190}{118256}One hears such things without|listening.
{118263}{118297}Good afternoon, Mrs Fisher.
{118301}{118350}Carry, how delightful to see you.
{118357}{118387}How delightful, Judy.
{118403}{118440}Oh, Lily.
{118458}{118492}What a pleasure to see you.
{118541}{118561}Gus!
{118568}{118596}Miss Bart.
{118613}{118660}I must see the head waiter, Judy.
{118932}{119001}Where Judy leads, the world will|follow.
{119025}{119068}Not your real friends.
{119120}{119181}Meanwhile, what do you say to|putting a few things in a trunk...
{119186}{119262}and spending the summer with|me and the Gormers?
{119326}{119394}To take me out of my ''friends'''|way you mean?
{119399}{119471}Till they realise how much they|miss you.
{119484}{119562}Besides, the Gormers have taken|a tremendous fancy to you.
{119572}{119673}I know they're not yourset, kind|of a social Coney Island.
{119680}{119781}But anyone's welcome who can make|noise and doesn't put on airs.
{119823}{119837}Yes.
{119865}{119887}I shall come.
{119927}{119980}Well, what shall it be?
{119996}{120051}Coup Jacques|orPechesa la Melba?
{120515}{120599}The more I think of my getting|you here, the better I like it.
{120604}{120686}More noise, more colour,|more slapdash sociability.
{120725}{120758}But greater good nature too.
{120762}{120788}Less rivalry.
{120794}{120828}Yes, it's true.
{120914}{120969}Soon everybody will be leaving...
{120992}{121057}for Newport and Bar Harbour|and Long Island.
{121108}{121173}And me to a hotel in|broiling NewYork.
{121258}{121276}Lily...
{121322}{121356}you must marry.
{121362}{121395}As soon as you can.
{121439}{121505}Do you mean to recommend me|to 'a good man's love'?
{121511}{121595}Neitherof my candidates answers|to that description.
{121600}{121618}Neither?
{121622}{121654}There are actually two?
{121680}{121721}Perhaps one-and-a-half.
{121734}{121822}All things being equal, I think|I'd prefer half a husband.
{121852}{121876}Who is he?
{121903}{121941}George Dorset.
{121946}{122003}Don't fly out at me till|you hear my reasons.
{122008}{122082}Since they got back from Europe|things have been going very badly.
{122087}{122156}Bertha's behaviour has strained|even George's credulity.
{122162}{122228}They're over at their place now|but the end will come soon.
{122232}{122264}The end will nevercome.
{122281}{122357}Bertha will always get him back|exactly when shewants him.
{122372}{122400}Oh, Lily.
{122416}{122473}He wouldn't stay with her ten|minutes if he knew.
{122512}{122532}"Knew"?
{122539}{122596}If he had positive proof, I mean.
{122618}{122673}Please, let's drop the subject.
{122678}{122708}It's too odious to me.
{122765}{122804}And the second candidate?
{122809}{122844}We mustn't forget him.
{122875}{122918}Sim Rosedale.
{123024}{123094}l think I'd like to go fora walk.
{123646}{123672}Miss Bart.
{123743}{123779}I've been hoping to meet you.
{123799}{123842}I'd have written if I'd dared.
{123917}{123962}I wanted to apologise.
{123970}{124007}Don't let us speak of it.
{124048}{124093}I was very sorry for you.
{124130}{124169}You must let me explain.
{124186}{124216}I was deceived.
{124243}{124292}I am more sorry for you then.
{124332}{124381}But you must see that|I am not exactly...
{124386}{124439}the person with whom this subject|can be discussed.
{124461}{124479}Why not?
{124483}{124551}It's you of all people I owe|an explanation to.
{124556}{124601}No explanation is necessary.
{124625}{124678}The situation was perfectly|clear to me.
{124691}{124740}Miss Bart, don't turn away.
{124878}{124908}You must understand...
{124913}{124997}that afterwhat happened, we|cannot be friends again.
{125025}{125068}Wasn't I punished enough?
{125143}{125182}Is there to be no respite?
{125189}{125246}I'd have thought you had complete|respite...
{125250}{125321}in the reconciliation that was|effected at my expense.
{125332}{125373}Don't put it that way.
{125380}{125441}All I ask you to understand is|that...
{125523}{125576}after the use that Bertha made of|me...
{125618}{125716}after all that her behaviour has|since implied...
{125736}{125804}it is impossible that you and l|should meet.
{125844}{125868}Please help me.
{125962}{125986}I am sorry.
{126030}{126069}There is nothing I can do.
{126150}{126193}You must have other friends...
{126197}{126236}otheradvisors.
{126252}{126297}l never had a friend like you.
{126363}{126414}Besides, you're the only one who|knows.
{126453}{126508}You were there in Monte Carlo.
{126588}{126621}You are mistaken.
{126663}{126693}I saw nothing.
{126731}{126763}l know nothing.
{126789}{126888}Just saywhat you know and the|way will be clearfor us both.
{126917}{126945}l know nothing.
{127061}{127114}You are sacrificing both of us.
{127176}{127202}l know nothing.
{127269}{127303}Absolutely nothing.
{127466}{127498}Who's gonna catch you?
{127643}{127667}Come along.
{127690}{127729}You ought to be in bed.
{127750}{127774}Yes, mother.
{127883}{127922}Goodnight, Miss Bart.
{127926}{127956}Goodnight, Edith.
{128014}{128034}Go on.
{128166}{128192}Where are the others?
{128276}{128329}I'm your only fellow guest.
{128455}{128516}Carry was trying to be subtle.
{128588}{128620}You look tired,
{128630}{128663}I've been sleeping badly.
{128782}{128851}In fact, I came especially|to see you.
{128860}{128898}On a delicate matter.
{128932}{128971}I hope you can believe that.
{129012}{129076}Thank you, I believe what you say.
{129098}{129164}lIyou wish.
{129210}{129240}But, Miss Lily...
{129244}{129295}I suppose that is what you wish.
{129303}{129373}And though I was unable to consent|when last you spoke to me...
{129377}{129449}I am ready, now that I know you|much better...
{129455}{129504}to put my happiness in your hands.
{129559}{129598}My dear Miss Lily...
{129603}{129675}you made me feel that my suit was|so hopeless that...
{129680}{129733}I had no intention of renewing it.
{129995}{130025}I can only blame myself...
{130029}{130103}if I gave you the impression|that my decision was final.
{130326}{130364}Before we say goodbye...
{130369}{130461}I want at least to thank you for|once having thought of me.
{130481}{130534}Why do you talk of saying goodbye?
{130571}{130632}Can't we still be good friends|all the same?
{130730}{130793}What is your idea of being|"good friends"?
{130857}{130922}Seeing me without asking me|to marry you?
{130966}{131005}That's about the size of it.
{131077}{131115}I like your frankness...
{131145}{131183}I'm afraid that our friendship...
{131187}{131252}can hardly continue|on those terms.
{131256}{131286}Miss Lily, what I mean...
{131291}{131359}What you mean to say is that|I'm not as desirable a match...
{131363}{131402}as once you thought me.
{131431}{131468}Yes, that is what I do mean.
{131493}{131542}I don't believe the stories about|you...
{131547}{131602}but my not believing them|won't alter the situation.
{131606}{131670}If they are not true, doesn't that|alter the situation?
{131674}{131773}You know as well as I do, last|year you wouldn't look at me.
{131777}{131818}Now you appear willing to do so.
{131834}{131879}What's changed in the interval?
{131910}{131946}Your situation.
{131994}{132039}You thought you could do better.
{132096}{132132}You think you can?
{132144}{132170}Yes, I do.
{132179}{132217}I've done verywell.
{132226}{132275}I've placed Wall Street under|obligations...
{132280}{132327}that only 5th Avenue can repay.
{132333}{132419}But the quickest way to queer|oneself with the right people...
{132423}{132470}is to be seen with the wrong ones.
{132484}{132533}I want to avoid mistakes.
{132604}{132632}I understand.
{132771}{132814}Goodbye, Mr Rosedale.
{132857}{132904}Why don't you use her letters?
{133003}{133067}Don't ask me how I know you|bought them.
{133071}{133097}I know.
{133123}{133223}I don't suppose you bought them|just to collect autographs.
{133252}{133303}You see, I know where you stand.
{133316}{133371}You have Bertha completely|in your power.
{133391}{133440}You wish to be rehabilitated|socially...
{133449}{133502}and you have the means of your|redemption.
{133546}{133644}In a deal like this, nobody comes|out with perfectly clean hands.
{133685}{133779}If you're going to fight Bertha,|don't inflict an open injury.
{133809}{133868}Reduce it to a private|transaction.
{133924}{133958}'Give and take' you mean?
{133972}{133994}Yes.
{134010}{134036}As in business.
{134040}{134068}Or politics.
{134073}{134109}You see how simple it is?
{134128}{134200}There's no point frightening|Bertha into line.
{134215}{134254}You have to keep her there.
{134314}{134357}That's my part of the business.
{134394}{134433}That's what I'm offering you.
{134442}{134534}To reconcile with Bertha and then|you'll marry me?
{134543}{134582}What do you say, Miss Lily?
{134599}{134693}You are mistaken in both the facts|and what you infer from them.
{134737}{134780}Well, I'll be damned!
{134818}{134867}I suppose it's because the|letters are to him?
{134947}{135000}I thought we understood each|other.
{135019}{135053}We do now.
{135385}{135409}Come in.
{135796}{135876}It's such a blessing to have a|quiet few weeks here.
{135942}{135997}Thank you for inviting me here.
{136017}{136060}I do love it in Tuxedo.
{136066}{136082}Yes.
{136091}{136129}It's a pleasant house.
{136150}{136213}One of my few treasured|possessions.
{136356}{136391}How are the Brys?
{136442}{136503}Louisa Bry is a stern taskmaster.
{136547}{136598}Talk about love making|peoplejealous.
{136603}{136648}It's nothing to social ambition.
{136717}{136793}I had a visit from Mattie Gormer|the other day.
{136820}{136879}She was with Bertha Dorset|of all people.
{136966}{137064}No doubt the rabbit always thinks|it's fascinating the anaconda.
{137140}{137189}Now they're fast friends...
{137194}{137253}I think Mattie will sacrifice|anything for her.
{137317}{137350}Including me?
{137483}{137513}My dear...
{137567}{137614}the world is vile.
{138036}{138056}Lily.
{138074}{138117}Mrs Hatch, I'm not dressed!
{138121}{138156}It doesn't matter.
{138160}{138229}This is the 20th Century,|not the Dark Ages.
{138233}{138294}As soon as you've eaten,|come to my rooms.
{138299}{138354}I'm leaving in twenty minutes,|so please be quick.
{138393}{138438}I cannot find my prescription.
{138442}{138466}Do you have it?
{138470}{138498}I'm always losing them.
{138502}{138551}You usually leave them on your|bureau, Mrs Hatch.
{138556}{138582}Of course I do.
{138587}{138632}Get it filled for me today.
{138636}{138683}Without my chloral I never sleep.
{138687}{138742}I have to see my beauty doctor|or I cannot face society.
{138760}{138813}The manicure will have to wait|till tomorrow.
{138819}{138868}Not up to it today, put heroff.
{138873}{138953}Don't look sour, Lily,|she won't mind.
{138957}{138983}She never minds.
{138988}{139029}After lunch I shall go to|Sherry's for tea...
{139034}{139093}then this evening I'm playing|bridge with my lawyer.
{139097}{139138}I'll try to go for a fitting|tomorrow morning...
{139143}{139207}but only if it doesn't interfere|with the art exhibition at four.
{139211}{139219}Then supperat...
{139223}{139268}No, theatre first, then supper.
{139273}{139349}If you don't tell me in advance|of these changes, How can I...
{139354}{139390}keep your diary accurately?
{139394}{139472}Engagements are made to be broken.|Especially with tradespeople.
{139477}{139510}They expect it.
{139514}{139544}Yes, Mrs Hatch.
{139577}{139603}By the way, Lily...
{139607}{139699}on Friday I'm dining with Melville|Stancy and the Gormers.
{139739}{139759}Yes, Mrs Hatch.
{139764}{139807}Don't forget my prescription.
{139811}{139849}It's on the bureau.
{139998}{140074}Mrs Fisher was anxious to know|how you were getting on.
{140104}{140159}Why didn't she look me up|herself then?
{140182}{140223}Afraid of being importunate.
{140260}{140324}You see, no such scruples|restrained me.
{140357}{140429}Then you've come to be|of some use to me?
{140440}{140460}Yes.
{140485}{140522}So what am I to do with you?
{140574}{140639}Talk things overwith me.
{140663}{140749}What makes you think that I have|anything to talk about?
{140776}{140864}My initiative doesn't go beyond|putting myself at your disposal.
{140898}{140968}I shouldn't have come if I'd|thought I'd be of no use to you.
{141080}{141119}Do you know where you are?
{141125}{141168}Of course I know where I am!
{141192}{141241}You must let me take you away from|here.
{141248}{141319}If you've come to say disagreeable|things about Mrs Hatch...
{141323}{141382}It is precisely your relationship|with her that concerns me.
{141387}{141426}My relationshipwith Mrs Hatch...
{141431}{141490}is one that I've no reason to be|ashamed of!
{141495}{141525}She's helped me earn a living...
{141529}{141595}when my old friends were quite|content to see me starve!
{141599}{141621}Nonsense!
{141626}{141673}Starvation is not the only|alternative.
{141678}{141749}Your aunt's legacy could make you|moderately independent.
{141757}{141802}Well, what you don't know...
{141806}{141888}is that I owe every penny|of that legacy!
{141931}{141959}Good God!
{141964}{141996}Every penny...
{142001}{142031}and more besides.
{142053}{142108}I have no money except my small|income...
{142113}{142195}and I need to earn money to keep|myself alive!
{142293}{142385}I should be happier to see you out|of this particular 'employment'.
{142392}{142429}But I should not.
{142497}{142546}ljust want to point out to you...
{142551}{142604}the false position you have placed|yourself in.
{142609}{142708}I suppose by that you mean my|being on the outside of society?
{142712}{142765}But I have long been excluded|from it...
{142769}{142839}and I remember you once telling me|that it was only those on...
{142843}{142896}the inside who took the difference|seriously!
{142901}{142979}Mrs Hatch's desire to be inside...
{142983}{143028}may put you in a false position.
{143033}{143059}You cannot want this!
{143074}{143168}You have already told me that the|sole object of my upbringing...
{143174}{143243}was to teach me to getwhat|I want.
{143253}{143343}Why not assume that that's|precisely what I am doing now?
{143378}{143479}You're not a successful example...
{143508}{143563}of that kind of upbringing.|Give me a little more time.
{143570}{143623}I may still do credit to my|training!
{143709}{143750}That was undignified.
{143769}{143861}Where does dignity end and|rectitude begin?
{143961}{143996}Good day, Miss Bart.
{144009}{144058}Good day, Mr Selden.
{147686}{147766}She got five dollars and her|picture in the paper.
{147770}{147790}The hat?
{147794}{147830}No, she got that yesterday.
{147835}{147884}No, the one with the green|paradise.
{147916}{147992}Madame asked me to alter that|Virot hat.
{148012}{148106}She's tall, slight,|but her hair's all frizzed out.
{148115}{148152}A lot like Mary Leach.
{148191}{148224}Only thinner.
{148458}{148486}Miss Bart.
{148517}{148597}Look at these spangles.|Every one sewed on crooked.
{148613}{148635}I'm sorry.
{148671}{148707}I'm afraid I'm not well.
{148714}{148790}If you can't do better, I'll|give the hat to Miss Kilroy.
{148797}{148838}Go back to binding edges.
{149328}{149352}Miss Bart.
{149622}{149677}Miss Bart, I must draw your|attention...
{149681}{149744}to the fact that yourwork|is poor...
{149748}{149782}and your attendance irregular.
{149812}{149857}Miss Haines is right.
{149878}{149931}I am clumsy and slow to learn.
{149959}{150020}I have been indisposed lately.
{150039}{150084}But I'll try to improve.
{150089}{150123}It's too late for that.
{150127}{150178}I took you on as an untrained|apprentice...
{150183}{150240}as a favourto Mrs Fisher...
{150244}{150291}but against my betterjudgement.
{150297}{150402}I'm afraid that I will have to|dispense with your services.
{150479}{150551}I trust you'll find a position|more suited to your skills.
{150582}{150606}Thank you.
{151339}{151369}How are you, Grace?
{151589}{151648}Her memory is everywhere.
{151755}{151791}The whole house.
{151983}{152021}And you, Lily...
{152055}{152087}how are you?
{152143}{152196}You look dreadfully tired.
{152356}{152394}I don't sleep at night.
{152475}{152511}Since when?
{152548}{152578}I don't...
{152665}{152700}I can't remember.
{152806}{152853}There are otherworries.
{152919}{152954}Dreadful things.
{153010}{153040}What things?
{153112}{153142}Poverty.
{153220}{153275}I can't think ofanything worse.
{153512}{153571}I can't go on this way.
{153666}{153732}Do you have any idea when the|legacies will be paid?
{153804}{153828}No, Lily.
{153912}{153967}No-one has received them yet.
{154024}{154058}Not even me.
{154110}{154177}The truth is, I need the money.
{154297}{154385}Would you be willing to lend me|the amount of my legacy?
{154475}{154524}You must be patient.
{154625}{154722}Remember how beautifully patient|Aunt Julia always was.
{154735}{154790}But you'll get everything, Grace.
{154797}{154858}It would be easy foryou to borrow|ten times the amount...
{154862}{154900}that I'm asking for.
{154962}{154984}Borrow?
{155027}{155090}I am at the end of my tether.
{155279}{155340}You imagine fora moment that I'd|raise money...
{155345}{155429}on my expectations from|Aunt Julia?
{155536}{155583}If you must know the truth...
{155588}{155637}it was your being in debt...
{155642}{155683}that brought on her last illness.
{155774}{155815}You won't help me then?
{156029}{156061}If there's anything I can do...
{156065}{156129}to make you realise the folly of|your course and ...
{156266}{156327}how much she disapproved of it...
{156511}{156609}I shall feel it is the truest way|of making up to you for her loss.
{157168}{157201}Thank you, Grace.
{157245}{157296}It was good of you to see me.
{157379}{157403}Goodbye.
{158184}{158210}Can I help?
{158316}{158346}Mrs Hatch?
{158366}{158386}Yes.
{158640}{158697}You mustn't increase the dose,|Mrs Hatch.
{158702}{158726}Of course not.
{159168}{159194}Miss Lily?
{159339}{159369}What's the matter?
{159398}{159447}I'm a little tired.
{159458}{159484}It's nothing.
{159678}{159723}Stay with me a moment, please.
{159789}{159821}We can't stay here.
{159825}{159889}Let's go to The Longworth|for some tea.
{160019}{160062}Take your tea strong.
{160137}{160186}I haven't seen you in ages...
{160264}{160311}I wondered what had become of you.
{160347}{160398}I have joined the working classes.
{160440}{160495}I was trying to learn to become a|milliner.
{160500}{160539}You can't be serious.
{160552}{160588}Perfectly serious.
{160707}{160773}I understood that you were with|Mrs Hatch.
{160812}{160861}She dismissed me two months ago.
{160900}{160970}After she had got into society...
{160974}{161038}it seems my reputation had become|a social liability.
{161098}{161182}Since then I have been obliged to|work for my living.
{161263}{161306}That wasn't for you anyhow.
{161343}{161369}I must go.
{161373}{161418}No, no, rest a little longer.
{161468}{161550}What did you mean about learning|to become a milliner?
{161554}{161587}Just what I said.
{161607}{161664}I am an apprentice at Madame|Regina's.
{161730}{161793}I was an apprentice at Madame|Regina's.
{161861}{161932}I understood you received a legacy|from your aunt.
{161949}{161985}Ten thousand dollars.
{162021}{162111}But it isn't paid until spring and|anyway, I owe it already.
{162127}{162157}Thewhole ten thousand?
{162170}{162208}Every penny.
{162343}{162415}I think Gus Trenorspoke to you|once...
{162420}{162490}about having made me some money in|stocks.
{162507}{162560}He made me nine thousand dollars.
{162600}{162664}I knew nothing about business.
{162677}{162765}I thought he had invested my|own money.
{162837}{162911}In fact what he had made|he had given me.
{162940}{162981}It was meant in kindness...
{162998}{163084}but it wasn't the sort of|obligation I could remain under.
{163111}{163160}I was incredibly stupid.
{163185}{163269}I spent the money before|I realised.
{163318}{163402}And so my aunt's legacy must|go to pay it back.
{163440}{163472}That is why...
{163516}{163563}That is why I must now work.
{163581}{163632}That'll clean you out altogether.
{163694}{163720}Altogether.
{163767}{163787}Yes.
{163849}{163898}Miss Lily, ifyou want my|backing...
{163902}{163924}Thank you.
{163972}{164035}Yourtea has been a great backing.
{164065}{164124}I feel equal to anything now.
{164552}{164599}Surely this isn't the place?
{164621}{164645}Yes.
{164658}{164692}I room and board here.
{164732}{164793}I have lived too long|on my friends.
{165195}{165244}You can't go on living here.
{165275}{165343}I have gone over my expenses|very carefully...
{165351}{165400}and I think I can manage it.
{165405}{165441}That's notwhat I mean.
{165495}{165536}It is what I mean.
{165624}{165675}I shall be out ofwork now.
{165761}{165804}What a way for you to talk.
{165858}{165901}You in a place like this.
{166048}{166105}My situation is nothing|exceptional.
{166110}{166145}But you are.
{166247}{166286}It's an outrage.
{166396}{166460}Look, it's none of my business...
{166489}{166542}but you must accept help from|somebody.
{166600}{166659}You spoke to me ofyourdebt|to Gus Trenor...
{166691}{166762}I'll lend you the money|to pay him.
{166766}{166788}Let me finish.
{166793}{166848}It'll be purely a business|arrangement.
{166864}{166909}What can you have against that?
{166936}{166966}Only this...
{166992}{167064}that is exactly what Gus Trenor|proposed.
{167076}{167156}Once the debt is paid I shall have|no security.
{167164}{167207}I have been compromised once...
{167212}{167255}I cannot be so again.
{167514}{167567}I am very grateful foryour|kindness...
{167606}{167655}but it is impossible.
{167679}{167712}You must see that.
{167915}{167978}We must think of your future.
{168028}{168099}If you only knew what little|difference that makes now.
{168215}{168276}At least let me tell Selden|where you're living.
{168302}{168330}It will do no good.
{168335}{168357}Please.
{168461}{168487}Very well.
{168525}{168580}You may tell him if you wish.
{168734}{168793}If only you'd let me help you...
{168802}{168865}you could wipe your feet on|them.
{171430}{171483}Why don't you use the letters?
{171499}{171542}It would be so simple.
{171608}{171649}It is so simple.
{173499}{173567}Today I'll tell you about the|plight of...
{173571}{173636}the poor people of Russia under|the Tsar.
{174283}{174342}Would you please inform|Mrs Dorset...
{174347}{174402}that Miss Lily Bart wishes to|speak with her.
{174409}{174456}Mrs Dorset is not at home, Miss|Bart.
{174514}{174567}Then I'd like to speak with|Mr Dorset.
{174574}{174672}I'm sorry, Mrand Mrs Dorset left|for the country two days ago.
{174833}{174876}Shall I take a message?
{174903}{174923}No.
{174962}{174990}No message.
{176418}{176457}I can recommend the armchair.
{177276}{177370}I came to say I am sorry|for the way we parted.
{177505}{177575}Forwhat I said to you|that day at Mrs Hatch's.
{177590}{177633}I was sorry too.
{177783}{177822}You look tired.
{177910}{177934}Do sit down.
{178153}{178179}You're drenched.
{178195}{178231}Let me make you some tea.
{178235}{178253}No.
{178303}{178342}I must go in a moment.
{178437}{178467}I must go.
{178569}{178630}I may not see you again|for a long time...
{178678}{178785}I have never forgotten the things|you said to me at Bellmont...
{178851}{178902}they have helped keep me...
{178907}{178968}from becoming the person many|people thought me to be.
{179005}{179031}I'm glad.
{179061}{179139}But nothing I said really|made the difference.
{179143}{179184}The difference is in yourself.
{179188}{179223}No, don't say that.
{179259}{179316}That is all that I have|lived on.
{179357}{179400}Don't take that from me.
{179527}{179597}We resist the great temptations...
{179649}{179743}but it is the little ones that|eventually pull us down.
{179812}{179910}I remember your saying that such a|life could never satisfy me...
{179927}{179992}and I was ashamed to admit|that it could.
{180080}{180135}That's what I wanted|to thank you for.
{180194}{180235}I have tried.
{180279}{180322}I have tried hard.
{180367}{180412}But life is difficult...
{180444}{180499}and I'm a useless person.
{180569}{180626}And now I'm on the rubbish heap.
{180771}{180795}Lily...
{180851}{180890}can I help you?
{180933}{181034}You told me once that you could|help me only by loving me.
{181091}{181144}You did love me for a moment...
{181177}{181210}and it helped me.
{181251}{181302}But that moment is gone.
{181321}{181366}And I let it go.
{181400}{181472}And one must go on living.
{181723}{181782}Lily, you mustn't speak like this.
{181865}{181885}Things...
{181889}{181930}may change, but...
{182015}{182070}you'll never go out of my life.
{182500}{182536}Let us be friends.
{182619}{182664}Then I shall feel safe...
{182712}{182747}whatever happens.
{182776}{182810}What do you mean?
{182832}{182862}What's going to happen?
{182873}{182895}Nothing.
{182949}{182981}Nothing's going to happen.
{183082}{183127}But I'd like some tea now.
{183945}{183980}Goodbye, Lawrence.
{185907}{185972}The WaldorfSavingBank|West53rdstreet. New York.
{186500}{186541}Ten thousand dollars.
{186653}{186673}Ten...
{186710}{186744}thousand dollars.
{187029}{187103}CharlesAugustus Trenor
{190468}{190496}Oh, Lily!
{191100}{191118}Lily?
{191196}{191224}Miss Bart?
{191259}{191302}It's a great mercy.
{191487}{191515}May I...
{191527}{191559}may I see her...
{191578}{191602}alone?
{191620}{191661}Will it take long?
{191687}{191719}It won't.
{193588}{193612}Lily.
{194131}{194167}Oh, Lily.
{194268}{194294}I love you.
