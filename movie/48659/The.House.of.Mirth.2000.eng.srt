00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,240 
Mr. Selden, what luck.

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,720 
-Good luck?
-Yes...

3
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,000 
I'm on my way to Gus Trenor's
at Bellmont...

4
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680 
and I've missed the three-fifteen
to Rhinebeck...

5
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,040 
and there isn't another train
till half past five.

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,040 
How nice that you come
to my rescue.

7
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920 
What form should my rescue take?

8
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640 
Oh, almost any.

9
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,920 
Shall we go to Sherry's for tea?

10
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,840 
I'm dying for a cup of tea, but
isn't there a quieter place?

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480 
I live near here.

12
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,240 
-At the Benedick still?
-Yes.

13
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,720 
On the top floor.

14
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,760 
Is it cool up there?

15
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,160 
Come up and see.

16
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120 
I'll take the risk.

17
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,080 
Oh, how delicious to have a place
like this all to oneself.

18
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,400 
Even women have been known to enjoy
the privileges of a flat.

19
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,680 
Governesses, yes, but not
poor marriageable girls.

20
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,240 
I even knew a girl
who once lived in a flat.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,520 
Oh, if I could only do over
my aunt's drawing room...

22
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400 
I should be a better woman.

23
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,320 
Is it so bad?

24
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720 
That shows how seldom
you come there.

25
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,160 
Why don't you come oftener?

26
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,840 
When I do come, it's not to look
at Mrs. Peniston's furniture.

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120 
Nonsense.

28
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,760 
You don't come at all.

29
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,600 
Yet we get on so well when we meet.

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560 
Cream or lemon?

31
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,520 
Lemon.

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,520 
I can't make you out.

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,680 
Of course there are men who
dislike me...

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,280 
and others who are afraid of me.

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,120 
They think I want to marry them.

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,720 
But I don't think you dislike me.

37
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,720 
And you can't possibly think I want
to marry you.

38
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,000 
No, I absolve you from that.

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,880 
Well then?

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,280 
Well, perhaps that's the reason.

41
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120 
The reason for what?

42
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,400 
The fact you don't want to marry
me.

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,000 
Perhaps I don't see that as a
strong inducement to go see you.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480 
Dear Mr. Selden...

45
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,160 
it's stupid of you to be
disingenuous...

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480 
and it's not like you to be stupid.

47
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,560 
I've been about too long.

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,280 
People are getting tired of me.

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,800 
They're saying I ought to marry.

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280 
Isn't marriage your vocation?

51
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,160 
What you're all brought up for?

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320 
I suppose so.

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,600 
So why not take the plunge and
have it over?

54
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,720 
You collect, do you?

55
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,240 
First editions and things?

56
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,240 
And do you collect Americana?

57
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,880 
No, that's rather out of my line.

58
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,840 
And Americana are horribly dull,
I suppose?

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160 
I should fancy so.

60
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,040 
Except to the historian.

61
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,840 
And yet they do fetch such fabulous
prices, don't they?

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,280 
Oh, only the very rich can afford
to buy them.

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560 
And you know that I'm not rich.

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,320 
But life is very expensive.

65
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,040 
Do you mind not being rich?

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960 
And having to work...

67
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,480 
do you mind that?

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,800 
Oh, the work itself is not so bad.

69
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,240 
I'm rather fond of the law.

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800 
But do you mind enough to have
to marry to get out of it?

71
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,040 
God forbid.

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,760 
You see, there's the difference.

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,360 
A girl must, and a man if he
chooses.

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,320 
Perhaps you'll meet your fate
tonight at the Trenor's.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,240 
I thought you might go there.

76
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120 
Those big parties bore me.

77
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880 
As they do me.

78
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320 
Then why go?

79
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640 
You forget...

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,640 
it's part of the business.

81
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720 
Good luck at Bellmont.

82
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,560 
Miss Bart?

83
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,760 
Well, of all people.

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,000 
Oh, Mr. Rosedale.

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,280 
How are you?

86
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,920 
Been up town doing some shopping?

87
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,760 
Yes.

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,040 
I came up to see my dressmaker.

89
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,800 
I didn't know there were
any dressmakers at the Benedick.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960 
That's the name of this building?

91
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,880 
Yes.

92
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,280 
I own it.

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,440 
The name means
"confirmed bachelor".

94
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,680 
I'm on my way to the Trenor's.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960 
Let me take you to the station.

96
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,840 
No.

97
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880 
Thank you.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,960 
You are very kind...

99
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,000 
but I don't want to trouble you.

100
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,800 
Mr Gryce, it's you.

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,960 
The seat next to me is empty.

102
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440 
Do take it.

103
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,440 
I suppose you're off to Bellmont.

104
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,720 
Yes. For a week.

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,360 
A whole week?

106
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,640 
How delicious.

107
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720 
How are you getting on with your
Americana?

108
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,960 
I've got a few new things.

109
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,960 
Your uncle had a very fine
collection, I believe.

110
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,240 
Yes, he collected for
a number of years, but...

111
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,400 
I must have this seat, Lily...

112
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,800 
Mr. Greece.

113
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240 
How do you do?

114
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,640 
I came this morning from
Mount Kisco in the motor car.

115
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,960 
Had to kick my heels at
Garrison's for an hour...

116
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,640 
without even a cigarette.

117
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,000 
I don't suppose you have
one left, have you, Lily?

118
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080 
What an absurd question, Bertha.

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440 
You don't smoke?

120
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,080 
Since when did you give it up?

121
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,680 
You don't smoke either, Mr. Gryce?

122
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,800 
How stupid of me.

123
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,520 
It was simply inhuman of Pragg
to go off now.

124
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000 
When I was in Tuxedo...

125
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,120 
I asked a lot of people down and
I mislaid the list...

126
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,000 
And I can't remember who's coming.

127
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,400 
This week will be a failure too.

128
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,400 
Judy, as if anybody's ever bored
at Bellmont.

129
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,520 
Everything's gone wrong.

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,280 
And now Bertha Dorset is
furious with me.

131
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,240 
Furious with you? Why?

132
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,560 
Because I told her Lawrence
Selden was coming, but...

133
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680 
he wouldn't after all and she's
unreasonable enough...

134
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,560 
to believe it was my fault.

135
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440 
I thought that was all over.

136
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760 
Oh, so it is. On his side.

137
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,240 
I shall call him on the telephone
and tell him he simply must come.

138
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,360 
Oh, don't.

139
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,120 
Good gracious, Lily.
Do you dislike him so much?

140
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880 
Not at all. I like him.

141
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,960 
Oh, don't say there's
any real harm in Bertha...

142
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,000 
but she delights in making people
miserable, especially her husband.

143
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,960 
Poor George.

144
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,640 
But she is dangerous.

145
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400 
And you are not nasty.

146
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560 
For always getting what she
wants...

147
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,320 
commend me to a nasty woman.

148
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,920 
l thought you were fond of Bertha.

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,400 
Oh, I am.

150
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,080 
It's much safer to be fond of
dangerous people.

151
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,800 
Did you know his father made a
fortune...

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,800 
out of inventing a device which
excludes fresh air from hotels?

153
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,840 
Who?

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,320 
Why to be sure, Lily.
Percy Gryce.

155
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,120 
But he's horribly shy and
easily shocked...

156
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,040 
Why don't you say it, Judy?

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440 
I have the reputation for being
on the hunt for a husband.

158
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,960 
Lily, I asked him here
on purpose for you.

159
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,080 
Percy Gryce and I are becoming
very good friends.

160
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360 
You're sure you wouldn't like
me to telephone Lawrence Selden?

161
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,240 
Quite sure.

162
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,440 
I do enjoy the quiet.

163
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800 
Don't you, Lily?

164
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,960 
I wish men would always stay away.

165
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,280 
It's much nicer without them.

166
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,520 
Oh, you don't count, George.

167
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,440 
One never talks to one's husband.

168
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,400 
But wives never like their husbands
talking to other women.

169
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,440 
Only if the women in question are
slightly too eligible or divorced.

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760 
Wives may do as they wish.

171
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000 
Husbands are expected to be like
money, influential but silent.

172
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000 
If divorcees were more acceptable,
I might be tempted.

173
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,920 
Gus! Oh dear.

174
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,560 
You see, I came after all.

175
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,240 
Thank you for keeping me from
playing bridge tonight, Mr. Gryce.

176
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,880 
Not at all, Miss Bart.

177
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,880 
I have no head for the game or
the rules of betting.

178
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,000 
I have been dragged into it
in the past...

179
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,400 
and I have lost an appalling
amount of money.

180
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760 
Mr. Gryce, I have shocked you.

181
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,560 
Whilst I do not approve, Miss
Bart, I do approve of you.

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,760 
I hope that means you forgive me.

183
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,680 
For I am penitent.

184
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,000 
Will you go to church tomorrow?

185
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,280 
Yes.

186
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,000 
May I accompany you, Miss Bart?

187
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840 
Of course, Mr. Gryce.

188
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,560 
Good night.

189
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560 
Good night, Miss Bart.

190
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080 
Dear me, am I late?

191
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440 
Late for what?

192
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,760 
Late for whom?

193
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,320 
Perhaps you had an earlier
engagement?

194
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280 
Yes, I had.

195
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480 
Perhaps I am in the way then?

196
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,920 
Mr. Selden is at your disposal.

197
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,640 
l never interfere with
Mr. Selden's engagements.

198
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360 
But I have no engagement
with Mr. Selden.

199
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,400 
I was to go to church...

200
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,960 
and I'm afraid that the carriages
have left without me.

201
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,040 
Have they left, do you know?

202
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,160 
Yes. I heard them drive away
some time ago.

203
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,160 
Then I shall have to walk.

204
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,800 
It's too late to get there.

205
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,880 
Well, I'll have the credit for
trying at any rate.

206
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,000 
You must be quite breathless.

207
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240 
How fast you walk.

208
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000 
Thought I'd never catch up.

209
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480 
But I've been sitting here
for nearly an hour!

210
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,320 
Waiting for me, I hope.

211
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680 
Waiting to see if you'd come.

212
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,600 
Weren't you sure I would?

213
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,840 
If I waited long enough.

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,160 
But I only had a limited time
to give to the experience.

215
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,400 
Why ''limited''?

216
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,960 
By my other engagement.

217
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,840 
Now I see why you were
getting up on your Americana.

218
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,040 
That's why I was waiting for you.

219
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,920 
To thank you for giving me so many
points.

220
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,680 
You can hardly do justice to the
subject in so short a time.

221
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,000 
Won't you devote the afternoon to
it?

222
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,400 
We'll take a walk and you can
thank me at your leisure.

223
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,160 
Let us sit here.

224
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,080 
I have broken two engagements for
you today...

225
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,600 
both of them with Percy Gryce.

226
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,560 
How many have you broken for me?

227
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560 
None.

228
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,240 
My only engagement at Bellmont
was with you.

229
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,640 
You really came to Bellmont
to see me?

230
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,840 
Of course I did.

231
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,560 
Why?

232
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,960 
l like to see what
you're doing.

233
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280 
You're such a wonderful spectacle.

234
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,120 
Well, now you're here, you can
see the effect first-hand.

235
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,440 
I don't think that my coming...

236
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,040 
has deflected your course of action
at all.

237
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760 
Give me one. I haven't smoked in
days.

238
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,040 
Why such unnatural abstinence?

239
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,000 
It is not considered becoming in a
'jeune fille a marier'.

240
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,000 
And at the present moment...

241
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,680 
I am a 'jeune fille a marier'.

242
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,720 
You must suppose me a
dull kind of person...

243
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,520 
If you think I never yield
to an impulse.

244
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,160 
But I don't suppose that.

245
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,720 
Your genius lies in converting
impulses into intentions.

246
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,640 
My genius?

247
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360 
My genius would appear to be my
ability...

248
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,080 
to do the wrong thing
at the right time.

249
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,640 
Or vice-versa.

250
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,000 
Is there any final test of genius
but success?

251
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240 
I certainly haven't succeeded.

252
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,000 
But you will marry
someone very rich.

253
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,360 
What a miserable future you foresee
for me.

254
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,120 
Haven't you seen it for yourself?

255
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,600 
Of course.

256
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,960 
But it seems so much darker when
you show it to me.

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,480 
Why do you do this to me?

258
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,200 
Why do you make the things that l
have chosen seem hateful to me...

259
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,200 
if you have nothing
to give me instead?

260
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840 
No. I have nothing to give you.

261
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,760 
If I had, it'd be yours,
you know that.

262
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,520 
But you belittle me, being so sure
they're the only things I care for.

263
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,240 
Isn't it natural for me to belittle
everything I can't offer you?

264
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,280 
Do you want to marry me?

265
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,560 
No, I don't.

266
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,040 
But perhaps I should
if you did.

267
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,240 
It would be a great risk.

268
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,680 
I've never concealed how great.

269
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440 
You are a coward.

270
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,800 
No.

271
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440 
It's you who are the coward.

272
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640 
Are you serious?

273
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600 
Why not?

274
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960 
I took no risk in being so.

275
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,320 
Why is it that when we meet...

276
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640 
we always play this
elaborate game?

277
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,800 
It's getting late.

278
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,560 
Let us go down.

279
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880 
l thought Mr. Gryce meant
to stay all week.

280
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,000 
He did, that's the worst of it.

281
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,040 
It shows he's running away
from you.

282
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,680 
Bertha's done her work and
poisoned him.

283
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,840 
What was it Bertha really
told Percy?

284
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,600 
Don't ask me. Horrors.

285
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,360 
All I can say is, Lily, that l
can't make you out.

286
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880 
He's not completely lost.

287
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,360 
There are ways.

288
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,880 
Whatever you do, do nothing.

289
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,240 
Lily, you'll never do anything
if you're not serious.

290
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,160 
Out of spirits?

291
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,040 
I'm a little dull.

292
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,840 
Is your last box of Doucet
dresses a failure...

293
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,600 
or did my wife rook you for
everything at bridge?

294
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,400 
I have to give up Doucet
dresses and bridge.

295
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,040 
I can't afford either any more.

296
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,320 
And Judy thinks me a bore.

297
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,680 
Fact is, she's angry with me.

298
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,120 
Angry with you? Nonsense.
My wife's devoted to you.

299
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,960 
She's my very best friend, and
that's why I mind vexing her.

300
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760 
I want to make my peace with her.

301
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,000 
She has her heart set on my
marrying money.

302
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,160 
A great deal of money.

303
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,160 
You don't mean Percy Gryce?

304
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,840 
Good Lord.

305
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,280 
How could Judy think you'd
do such a thing?

306
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,520 
Sometimes I think a man...

307
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,760 
understands a woman's motives
better than her own sex does.

308
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,480 
Good Lord. I could've
told Judy that.

309
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000 
Oh, by the way, Miss Lily...

310
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,720 
I wish you'd try to persuade
Judy to be civil to Rosedale.

311
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,600 
I did a neat stroke of business
through him last week.

312
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,960 
If she'd only ask him to come
and dine now and then...

313
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,160 
I'd get almost anything out of him.

314
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,440 
He's going to be richer than
all of us one of these days.

315
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,160 
Would you do me a favour?

316
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,880 
A very great favour?

317
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,280 
Why, of course.

318
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,120 
I don't mean to bore you with all
this...

319
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,880 
but I'm entirely dependent on my
aunt...

320
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000 
and though she's very kind,
she gives me no regular allowance.

321
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,080 
I have a tiny income of my own
but it's been badly invested.

322
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,240 
Seems to bring in less each year.

323
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,960 
And recently I've lost money at
cards.

324
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,720 
I've paid off my debts,
of course, but...

325
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,840 
I dare not tell my aunt.

326
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,000 
I can no longer go on living my
present life.

327
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,840 
And Percy Gryce?

328
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,640 
I can't make that sort of marriage.

329
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,080 
You gave him the sack, and that's
why he left by train this morning?

330
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,000 
I can make you a handsome sum
without endangering your capital.

331
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,280 
I am so ignorant about money
matters...

332
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,040 
and I'd be so grateful to
have a good advisor.

333
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000 
Leave it to me.

334
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800 
I'll find a solution.

335
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,480 
Really, Lily...

336
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,240 
you're as careless and frivolous
as your poor parents were.

337
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840 
Why do you go to Bellmont...

338
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,040 
if you don't remember what happened
or whom you saw there.

339
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,160 
But there was no one new.

340
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,160 
Just the usual throng.

341
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,240 
Was Mr. Selden there?

342
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760 
Yes. He came later.

343
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,760 
And Mr. Rosedale,
was he there?

344
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,080 
No, of course not.

345
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,960 
Why do you ask?

346
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,560 
Passing interest, merely.

347
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,520 
Mr. Selden tells me that socially
Mr. Rosedale...

348
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,360 
is very ubiquitous now.

349
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,160 
I have always thought that
men like Rosedale...

350
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,280 
and their methods of gaining
fortunes...

351
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,280 
were at best, questionable,
at worst, criminal.

352
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,520 
To grow richer...

353
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,200 
at a time when most people's
investments are shrinking...

354
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,080 
strikes me as very bad taste.

355
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,840 
But society still uses such men,
if only obliquely.

356
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,120 
If obliquity were a vice
we should all be tainted.

357
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,400 
Only someone without family could
make such a vulgar remark.

358
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,120 
Aunt Julia, you are my family.

359
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,440 
Just as I thought.

360
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,760 
Extraordinary that I can't teach
the parlour-maid...

361
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,760 
to draw the blinds down evenly.

362
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920 
Will you see to it, Grace?

363
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,920 
Jennings, we'll take tea
in the upstairs sitting room.

364
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400 
Lily, you read me the obituaries.

365
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,400 
Aunt Julia, Grace does it
so much better than me.

366
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,960 
She can make the most insignificant
death seem interesting.

367
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,880 
I'll see to the blinds.

368
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,320 
Very well, you may join us later.

369
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,120 
It's a Mrs. Haffen, Miss.

370
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,520 
She won't say what she wants.

371
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,640 
You want to see me?

372
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,640 
Something you might like to see.

373
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320 
You have something belonging to me?

374
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,200 
Not exactly.

375
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,920 
I don't understand.

376
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,160 
If it's not mine,
then why are you here?

377
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360 
When I worked at the Benedick...

378
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,640 
I was in charge of cleaning the
gentlemen's rooms.

379
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,440 
Most gentlemen are careful about
the letters they get.

380
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,160 
Burn them in winter, tear them
into bits in summer.

381
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,440 
But Mr. Selden wasn't
so particular.

382
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,480 
I know nothing of these letters.

383
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,760 
I have no idea why you've
brought them here.

384
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,280 
To sell them.

385
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,120 
I saw you coming out of
Mr. Selden's rooms.

386
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,520 
So I guessed they were worth
more to you than me.

387
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,480 
You promised me we'd meet...

388
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,400 
when George was away from town.

389
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,040 
Although you've forbidden me
to come to you, I will.

390
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,440 
I cannot bear George near me.

391
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360 
If he touches me I want to scream.

392
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,920 
His very presence is unbearable.

393
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,200 
My darling Lawrence, you are
my consolation, my only joy.

394
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,320 
In you I find more freedom and
support than I've ever known.

395
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,840 
Your devoted Bertha.

396
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,920 
What do you want for them?

397
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,280 
One hundred and fifty.

398
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,880 
One hundred.

399
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,840 
I've got to live too.

400
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,760 
I've offered you all that I'm
prepared to pay for the letters.

401
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,720 
One hundred.

402
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240 
If you would forgive your enemy...

403
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,920 
first inflict a hurt on them.

404
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,600 
Oh, Bertha.

405
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200 
How could you have been so
indiscreet.

406
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,520 
l now pronounce you man and wife.

407
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,880 
Never seen you look more lovely.

408
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,560 
Oh, Gus.

409
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,280 
Lily, I've got a cheque for you.

410
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,520 
Another dividend?

411
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,480 
You have both Rosedale and me
to thank for it.

412
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360 
I've made you five thousand
on his tip...

413
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,280 
And re-invested four
on your behalf.

414
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,640 
With promise of another big rise.

415
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,640 
Well...

416
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,960 
I can't thank you properly now.

417
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,880 
I don't want to be thanked. I want
you to be nice to Rosedale and me.

418
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080 
I'd like to see you now and then.

419
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,960 
Come on over to Bellmont.

420
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,280 
I'll send the motor.

421
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,240 
You say the most absurd things.

422
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,440 
Besides, it's impossible.

423
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,200 
My aunt is back in town...

424
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,000 
and I must stay with her.

425
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,320 
You must come...

426
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,920 
to see Mrs. Peniston and l
next time you are in town.

427
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,960 
Then you can tell me how to better
invest my small fortune.

428
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,720 
This is luck.

429
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,080 
I was wondering if I'd be able
to have a word with you.

430
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,400 
I haven't recovered my self-
respect...

431
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,920 
since you showed me how poor
my ambitions were.

432
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,760 
On the contrary...

433
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,400 
I thought I had been
the means of proving...

434
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,720 
they were more important to you
than anything else.

435
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,240 
Lily.

436
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,560 
We thought you'd given us the slip.

437
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480 
Been hunting all over for you.

438
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,280 
I wanted to invite you to my box...

439
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,640 
at the opera
on opening night.

440
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,960 
Gus has promised to come
to town on purpose.

441
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,320 
He's a tremendous admirer of yours.

442
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,400 
I fancy he'd go a lot farther for
the pleasure of seeing you.

443
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,880 
The Trenors are my best friends.

444
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,680 
l think we'd all go a long way
to see one other.

445
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,240 
How's your luck been
lately on Wall street?

446
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,000 
I hear Gus pulled off a nice
little pile for you last month.

447
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,600 
I had a little money to invest...

448
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,720 
and Mr. Trenor has been helping me
in such matters.

449
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,880 
I had a lucky turn.

450
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,440 
Is that what you call it?

451
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,680 
You've had a great many yourself.

452
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,600 
Is that the latest creation of the
dressmaker at the Benedick?

453
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,520 
If so, it's a great success.

454
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,320 
Isn't it, Mr. Selden?

455
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,560 
That's nice of you.

456
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,600 
It'd be nicer still if you'd
get me a glass of lemonade.

457
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080 
Pleasure.

458
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,960 
They met six weeks ago at Bertha
Dorset's...

459
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,040 
and have been devoted ever since.

460
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,600 
The engagement's to be
announced next week.

461
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,800 
They say it'll be the nicest
marriage possible.

462
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,760 
One dull fortune
marrying another.

463
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,920 
Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce?

464
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,640 
Well, well.

465
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,120 
Ladies and gentlemen...

466
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,280 
Miss Lily Bart, as 'summer'
by Watteau.

467
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480 
She's never looked so radiant.

468
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,360 
l like her best in that simple
dress.

469
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,520 
Makes her look like the real Lily.

470
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000 
The Lily I know.

471
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,680 
The Lily we know.

472
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,200 
She's herself with a few people
only.

473
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,160 
She has it in her to become
whatever she's believed to be.

474
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,040 
We must think the best of her.

475
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,440 
I'll tell her that.

476
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,080 
She always says you dislike her.

477
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,000 
Well, Grace. How's life at
Richfield?

478
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,680 
Quiet.

479
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,480 
Aunt Peniston sees very little
company.

480
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,800 
I'm sure your being there
gave her much pleasure.

481
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,760 
I am as reliable
as roast mutton.

482
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,400 
But Aunt Julia is not alone...

483
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,080 
in preferring Lily's
erratic brilliance.

484
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,640 
You should marry, Grace.

485
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,000 
We should all marry,
Mr. Selden.

486
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200 
You never speak to me.

487
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,720 
I'm never near you enough.

488
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,400 
You think hard things of me.

489
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,520 
l think of you...

490
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,160 
at any rate.

491
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,040 
Why do we never see each other?

492
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,440 
I have my law practice and...

493
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,520 
you're always surrounded
by admirers.

494
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,280 
There's no admirers at my aunt's.

495
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,480 
Well...

496
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,960 
then, perhaps I might take
tea with you.

497
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,360 
At Mrs. Peniston's
next week?

498
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,120 
Yes.

499
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,120 
Come at four on Friday.

500
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,280 
Then we can talk.

501
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,360 
I've so much to say to you.

502
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,080 
I need your help.

503
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,680 
You promised me once you'd help me.

504
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,040 
The only way I can help you...

505
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,320 
is by loving you.

506
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,200 
Love me.

507
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,880 
But don't tell me so.

508
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,080 
I'd hate to miss the train.

509
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,040 
Selden, going too?

510
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,080 
-Aren't you staying for supper?
-No.

511
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,000 
When people crowd their rooms so
you can't get near anyone...

512
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,080 
you wish to speak to I'd sooner go.

513
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640 
My wife was right to stay away.

514
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,120 
She says life is too short to spend
it breaking new people in.

515
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,240 
Thank you.

516
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,640 
Lily and Gus Trenor, you say?

517
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,600 
Aunt, of course I don't mean...

518
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,600 
Then what do you mean, Grace?

519
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,120 
Do people say he's in love with
her?

520
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,560 
People always say
unpleasant things.

521
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,280 
It's a pity, though, that Lily
makes herself so conspicuous.

522
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,600 
Conspicuous?

523
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,840 
Does he mean to divorce
then marry her?

524
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,880 
No, it's...

525
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,360 
it's a flirtation.

526
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,560 
Nothing more.

527
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,800 
A flirtation?

528
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880 
With a married man?

529
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,000 
Such things were never heard of in
my day.

530
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,560 
Look here, Lily...

531
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,400 
Judy and I've been in town for
weeks. When am I going to see you?

532
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,880 
You can find me any afternoon
at my aunt's.

533
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,680 
Come see me there and
we can have a quiet talk.

534
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,240 
You put me off with that at the
Van Osburgh wedding.

535
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,920 
Truth is, now you've got what you
wanted you'd rather not see me.

536
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,480 
Don't be foolish, Gus.

537
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,960 
If you want to see me
you can come to my aunt's.

538
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,360 
What else is being said?

539
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,560 
That Gus Trenor pays her bills.

540
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,480 
Rubbish.

541
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,360 
Lily has her own income.

542
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,480 
And I provide for her handsomely.

543
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,480 
There are her gambling debts.

544
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,680 
What do you mean?

545
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,480 
She plays bridge.

546
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,360 
Who told you my niece plays
cards for money?

547
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,240 
Mrs. Gryce told me that it
was Lily's gambling debts...

548
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,640 
that frightened Percy.

549
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,320 
In fact people are inclined to
excuse her on that account.

550
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,080 
Excuse her for what?

551
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,920 
For accepting the attentions of
men like Gus Trenor.

552
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,560 
Thank you for telling me, Grace.

553
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,960 
But I must say, this unwelcome
information...

554
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,240 
has ruined the Mozart for me.

555
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,240 
Lily, let's leave before the first
act starts.

556
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,160 
Judy's as cross as two sticks when
she's away from Bellmont.

557
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,520 
Come to the house now.

558
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,120 
Is Judy unwell?

559
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,480 
A visit from you might be just
what's needed.

560
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,960 
Very well, Gus.

561
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,720 
I shall come with you.

562
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,560 
Doesn't it look as if we're waiting
for the body to be brought down?

563
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,160 
Where's Judy?

564
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,640 
She's not up to seeing anybody.

565
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,640 
You mean to say she's not well
enough to see me?

566
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360 
Devil of a headache.

567
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,520 
Quite knocked out by it.

568
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,200 
In that case, will you have the
goodness to call me a cab?

569
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,120 
Why must you go?

570
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,160 
It's late and we are alone.

571
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,320 
I must insist.

572
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,280 
Always the same old story.

573
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,320 
Can't give me five minutes but
you're charming to others.

574
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880 
I only went to that stupid
opera to be with you.

575
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,120 
I insist that you call me a cab.

576
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,800 
Suppose I won't?

577
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,360 
What then?

578
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,440 
If you force me I shall
go upstairs to Judy.

579
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520 
Sit down.

580
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,200 
I've got a word to say to you.

581
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,000 
If you have anything to say to me
you must say it at another time.

582
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,320 
I shall go upstairs to Judy unless
you call me a cab at once.

583
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,880 
Go upstairs, Judy isn't there.

584
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,840 
You mean to say that Judy
is not in this house?

585
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,640 
She isn't even in town.

586
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,920 
I don't believe you.

587
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,440 
My wife's still at Bellmont.

588
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,640 
If she were not coming to town
she would have telephoned.

589
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,440 
She did.

590
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,920 
I received no message.

591
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,480 
I didn't send any.

592
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,080 
How dare you compromise me in this
way?

593
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,280 
Don't take that high tone with me.

594
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,720 
I've been patient long enough.

595
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,240 
After all...

596
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,600 
if you pay for the dinner you're
allowed to sit at the table.

597
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,400 
I don't know what you mean.

598
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,480 
I didn't begin this business.

599
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,840 
Kept out of the way.

600
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,240 
But I can see fast enough when
I'm being made a fool of.

601
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,960 
Now you've got what you wanted,
Gus isn't needed any more.

602
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,920 
Well that isn't playing fair, Lily.

603
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,080 
It's dodging the rules of the game.

604
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,320 
And now you've got to pay.

605
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,880 
You mean I owe you money?

606
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,960 
You told me it was all right.

607
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,360 
It was all right. It is all right.

608
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,200 
You're welcome to it. All of it.

609
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,640 
I just want to be thanked a little.

610
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,160 
I have thanked you!

611
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,160 
Or do you wish for payment in kind?

612
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,440 
No!

613
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,760 
If I owe you money, I'll pay you!

614
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,120 
You owe me nine thousand dollars.

615
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,320 
Nine thousand?

616
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,040 
I will pay you.

617
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,280 
I suppose you'll go to Selden or
Rosedale for it.

618
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,480 
Unless you've settled those
scores already...

619
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640 
and I'm the only one left out
in the cold.

620
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520 
What more do you have to say to me?

621
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,160 
Go home.

622
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,520 
Come here Lily.

623
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,560 
I wish to speak to you.

624
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,640 
Ant Julia, it's very late
and I am very tired.

625
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,080 
I must insist, Lily.

626
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,960 
You're a bad colour, Lily.

627
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,840 
This incessant rushing about is
beginning to tell on you.

628
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,840 
I don't think it's that.

629
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,200 
I've had other worries.

630
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,320 
The fact is...

631
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,600 
I owe some money.

632
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,480 
I...

633
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,680 
I've been foolish.

634
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,440 
There are bills that are pressing.

635
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,240 
I paid your dressmaker's bill
last October.

636
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,800 
But if you owe Madame Celeste
another thousand dollars...

637
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,080 
She may send me your account.

638
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,880 
It's a good deal more than that.

639
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560 
A good deal more?

640
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,520 
To whom?

641
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,520 
Do I know these people?

642
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,600 
Some by name,
others by reputation.

643
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960 
Then they're of no consequence.

644
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,480 
These debts I speak of
are different.

645
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,840 
The fact is...

646
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,080 
I've been playing cards.

647
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,480 
It's true then?

648
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,760 
You play cards for money?

649
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,520 
Do you play on Sundays?

650
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,040 
You're hard on me, Aunt Julia.

651
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,640 
l never really cared for cards...

652
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,880 
and one hates to be thought
priggish and one...

653
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,800 
drifts into doing what others do.

654
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,960 
I've had a dreadful lesson.

655
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,080 
If you help me out, I promise...

656
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,840 
You needn't make any promises.

657
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,200 
It's unnecessary.

658
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,360 
When I offered you a home...

659
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,160 
I didn't undertake to pay
your gambling debts.

660
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,480 
Aunt Julia, you mean
that you won't help me?

661
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,360 
I shall certainly not do anything
to give the impression...

662
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,040 
that I countenance your behaviour.

663
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,360 
Aunt Julia, I will be disgraced!

664
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,600 
I consider that you are
disgraced, Lily.

665
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,440 
And now I must ask you to leave me.

666
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,680 
This scene has been
extremely painful to me...

667
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,680 
and I have my own health
to consider.

668
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,880 
And tell Jennings I wish to see no-
one until tomorrow afternoon.

669
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,720 
And then only Grace Stepney.

670
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,400 
Grace?

671
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,520 
Yes, Aunt Julia.

672
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,440 
Lily, it's after midnight.

673
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,080 
What will Aunt Julia think?

674
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,120 
I don't care.

675
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,440 
I couldn't go to my room.

676
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,520 
I hate it so.

677
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,760 
Lily, what's happened?

678
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,720 
Can't you tell me?

679
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,920 
l thought I could
manage my own life...

680
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,600 
But I've been so foolish, Grace.

681
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,640 
To the point of being compromised.

682
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,800 
By whom?

683
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,440 
Mr. Selden?

684
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,080 
No, not Mr. Selden.

685
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,920 
I've been careless and imprudent
about money.

686
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,440 
I'm frightened to think what I owe.

687
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,320 
Grace, you know Lawrence.

688
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,360 
If I asked him to help me...

689
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,360 
told him why...

690
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,360 
would he loathe me if I told
him everything?

691
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,120 
No.

692
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,320 
You must not do that.

693
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,080 
He is like other men.

694
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,360 
They have minds like moral
fly-paper.

695
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,240 
They can forgive a woman almost
anything except losing her name.

696
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,440 
If you wish to keep your
reputation intact, Lily...

697
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,560 
tell him nothing.

698
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,640 
But he must've spoken about me.

699
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720 
What does he really think of me?

700
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,080 
We've never discussed you, Lily.

701
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,720 
I have no idea what
Mr. Selden thinks.

702
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,360 
But I must trust in his good faith.

703
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,840 
I'll write him and ask him to come.

704
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,920 
Goodnight, Grace.

705
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,240 
Goodnight, Lily.

706
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,320 
Lawrence!

707
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,680 
Lawrence!

708
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,280 
Jennings. Is my aunt downstairs?

709
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,680 
No, Miss Bart.

710
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,800 
Mrs. Peniston left for Richfield
early this morning...

711
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,240 
with Miss Stepney.

712
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,600 
Thank you.

713
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,760 
Would you see that the boy delivers
this to Mr. Selden at the Benedick?

714
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,880 
Yes, Miss.

715
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,760 
Would you serve tea at four...

716
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,000 
in the downstairs sitting room and
show Mr. Selden in when he arrives?

717
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,240 
Yes, Miss Bart.

718
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:03,760 
Thank you.

719
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,560 
Mr. Rosedale.

720
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,480 
Pretty well done.

721
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,120 
Yes, very well done.

722
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,000 
Why put up this kind of bluff?

723
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,880 
Why aren't you straight with me?

724
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,000 
l know there have been times
when you've been worried.

725
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,480 
A girl like you shouldn't have
worries.

726
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,000 
You're quite right, Mr. Rosedale.

727
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,440 
I have had worries.

728
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,840 
I've been careless about money.

729
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,480 
I'm offering you the chance to turn
your back on that once and for all.

730
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,760 
I know you're not in love with me.

731
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,280 
You're not even fond of me.

732
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,360 
Yet.

733
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,880 
I'm very much flattered by your
offer...

734
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,840 
but I should be selfish and
ungrateful...

735
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,160 
if I made my reason for accepting
your generosity financial.

736
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,680 
Miss Bart...

737
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,800 
I generally get what
I want in life.

738
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,760 
I have a certain social position
and the means to maintain it.

739
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,400 
Now all I want is the woman...

740
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,760 
the right woman, to share both
with me.

741
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,240 
You're fond of luxury and amusement
and to not have to settle for it.

742
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,280 
I can provide the style...

743
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,520 
and the means of settling.

744
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,880 
You're mistaken on one point...

745
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,440 
Mr. Rosedale.

746
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,400 
Whatever I enjoy...

747
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,600 
I'm prepared to pay for.

748
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,240 
I have spoken too plainly.

749
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,360 
I didn't mean to give offence.

750
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520 
Give me time to consider your
kindness.

751
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,520 
Goodbye, Miss Bart.

752
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,280 
You will consider my proposal?

753
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600 
Of course.

754
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,440 
Yes?

755
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,120 
Are you alone, Lily?

756
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,520 
Yes, quite alone, Bertha.

757
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,840 
Everyone has gone away.

758
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,480 
My aunt to Richfield,
everyone else to Europe.

759
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,440 
Except Lawrence Selden, who's gone
to London.

760
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,480 
How unsophisticated of him.

761
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,400 
Will you join us then on a cruise
to the Mediterranean?

762
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,960 
Well, I'm not sure I'm able to.

763
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,840 
You'll be doing me a great service.

764
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,920 
You're always good with George...

765
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,240 
listening to the stories he's been
telling since the Civil War.

766
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,360 
You're the only one with enough
fortitude to take an interest.

767
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,480 
Nonsense.

768
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,440 
George can be charming.

769
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,240 
Good. You'll come then?

770
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,640 
Yes. It'll be delightful.

771
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,920 
Goodbye.

772
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,520 
Mr. Selden.

773
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,000 
Mrs. Fisher.

774
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,000 
Do join us.

775
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,120 
What brings you to Monte Carlo?

776
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,720 
I finished my business with a
client in London...

777
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,520 
and decided to come down and renew
my objective interest in life.

778
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,080 
So you're not so far removed from
being manipulated...

779
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,680 
by the strings of society
as one might think.

780
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,960 
Mrs. Fisher, none of us are.

781
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,960 
We're starving to death because we
can't decide where to lunch.

782
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,880 
One gets the best things at ''The
Terrasse''...

783
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,920 
but all the Americans go there now.

784
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,080 
I do believe the Dorsets are back.

785
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,520 
It's their yacht...

786
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,520 
"The Sabrina"

787
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,320 
Oh, yes.

788
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,040 
I often have this strange and
vivid dream...

789
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,000 
of an unknown woman
whom I love and who loves me...

790
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,680 
and who, each time,
is neither exactly the same...

791
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,640 
nor exactly different but
who loves me and understand me.

792
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,200 
For she understands me and
my heart is transparent...

793
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,960 
to her alone, alasl
Which ceases to be a problem...

794
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,160 
to her alone, and the sweat
of my pale brow.

795
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,000 
She alone knows
how to cool it with tears.

796
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,960 
Is she brunette,
blonde or red-head?

797
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,920 
He's reading Verlaine to her now.

798
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,600 
In French.

799
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,640 
What's the use of mincing matters?

800
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,640 
We all know what Bertha brought
Lily abroad for.

801
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,440 
The Silverton affair is
at the acute stage.

802
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,640 
George needs to be distracted.

803
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,560 
And I'm sure Lily distracts him.

804
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,800 
A clever woman would know when
to play her cards right.

805
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,840 
But she's never been clever in
that way.

806
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,360 
I hope there hasn't been
a row.

807
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,520 
Where the devil are they?

808
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,840 
Bertha!

809
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,080 
Bertha!

810
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,440 
How did you find London,
Mr. Selden?

811
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,160 
More agreeable than New York?

812
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,480 
In some ways, yes.

813
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,920 
Nevertheless, I came to see you.

814
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,040 
To see me?

815
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,280 
Or to see an older friend?

816
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,360 
I beg you to leave the yacht.

817
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,600 
To leave?

818
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,440 
Why? What has happened?

819
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,920 
Nothing. But if something should,
why be in the way of it?

820
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,360 
How do you think I'd leave Bertha?

821
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,920 
You have yourself to think of now.

822
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,040 
Nothing will happen.

823
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,320 
Of course not. I'm sure.

824
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,240 
Have you seen Bertha?

825
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,240 
No.

826
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,200 
Is she not up yet?

827
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,600 
Not up yet!

828
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,120 
Has she gone to bed?

829
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,280 
You know what time she came
aboard this morning?

830
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,640 
At seven!

831
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,000 
Seven?

832
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,520 
Was there an accident?

833
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,440 
There was no accident.

834
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,160 
I waited for them all night.

835
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,560 
Why didn't you call me
to share your vigil?

836
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,520 
You wouldn't have liked the
denouement.

837
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,320 
The denouement?

838
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,080 
Isn't that too big a word for
such a small incident?

839
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,000 
Don't!

840
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,360 
Don't!

841
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,760 
I only want to help you.

842
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,680 
You do so by being sweet
and patient with me.

843
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,000 
You can't want to see me
ridiculous.

844
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,040 
If it hadn't been for you I'd
have ended it long ago.

845
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,720 
I'll go to see Selden.

846
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,760 
No!

847
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,160 
No.

848
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,120 
Why not?

849
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,040 
One lawyer is as good as another.

850
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,360 
Very well.

851
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,920 
Go and see Mr. Selden then.

852
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,600 
You'll have time before dinner.

853
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,600 
I ought to say good morning.

854
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,680 
l tried to see you but
you weren't up.

855
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,040 
No. I got to bed late.

856
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,080 
After we separated during the
fete, we thought we should wait...

857
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,880 
but we missed you.

858
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,440 
You missed us?

859
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,800 
But I thought you didn't get back
to the yacht until this morning.

860
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,080 
Who told you that?

861
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,200 
George.

862
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,480 
Is that his version?

863
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,240 
Poor George.

864
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,560 
He's had one of his attacks again.

865
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,280 
It's very bad for him to be
worried.

866
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,640 
Anything upsetting always brings
on an attack.

867
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,800 
''Anything upsetting''?

868
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,560 
Yes.

869
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,400 
Such as having you so
conspicuously on his hands...

870
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,720 
during the small hours.

871
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,840 
You know, my dear, you're
rather a responsibility...

872
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,400 
in such a scandalous place after
midnight.

873
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,080 
Well really...

874
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,960 
considering you burdened him with
that responsibility.

875
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,480 
A married man should not have the
burden of being seen alone...

876
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,080 
with a single woman.

877
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,760 
Yes, we were alone.

878
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,680 
Is that so dreadful?

879
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,920 
After all, we lost you as much
as you mislaid us.

880
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,800 
So now it is my fault...

881
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,760 
for not having the superhuman
cleverness to find you...

882
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,600 
in that dreadful crowd?

883
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,480 
Or the imagination to believe...

884
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,560 
that you wouldn't wait for us on
the quay until we met you?

885
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,360 
No, simply by us
all keeping together!

886
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,960 
''Keeping together''?

887
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,480 
Lily, you are not a child
to be led by the hand.

888
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,840 
Nor to be lectured, Bertha.

889
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,720 
Lecture you?

890
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,320 
Heaven forbid.

891
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,520 
I was merely trying to give you
a friendly hint.

892
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,160 
It's usually the other way round.
I'm expected to take hints...

893
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,120 
not to give them.

894
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,080 
Hints?

895
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,040 
From me to you?

896
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,280 
Negative ones merely.

897
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,520 
What not to be or to do
or to see.

898
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,880 
But if you'll let me say so...

899
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,320 
I didn't know one of my negative
duties...

900
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,320 
was not to warn you when you took
your imprudence too far.

901
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,120 
Did you see George today?

902
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,560 
Yes.

903
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,760 
Well...

904
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,240 
What happened?

905
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,080 
What will happen?

906
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,120 
Nothing, as yet.

907
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,680 
And nothing in the future.

908
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,720 
You're sure?

909
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,680 
I'm not sure, but I'm
a good deal surer.

910
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,960 
No, thank you.

911
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,800 
Assume everything
is as usual.

912
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,680 
Before I go I want t
