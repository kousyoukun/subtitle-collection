1
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:15,241
Mr Selden, what luck.

2
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,725
-Good luck?
-Yes...

3
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,003
I'm on my way to Gus Trenor's
at Bellmont...

4
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,675
and I've missed the three-fifteen
to Rhinebeck...

5
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,042
and there isn't another train
till half past five.

6
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,043
How nice that you come
to my rescue.

7
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,917
What form should my rescue take?

8
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:33,638
Oh, almost any.

9
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:37,920
Shall we go to Sherry's fortea?

10
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:41,841
I'm dying for a cup of tea, but
isn't there a quieter place?

11
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:43,486
I live near here.

12
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,240
-At the Benedick still?
-Yes.

13
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:46,726
On the top floor.

14
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,766
Is it cool up there?

15
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:50,163
Come up and see.

16
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,120
I'll take the risk.

17
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:05,076
Oh, how delicious to have a place
like this all to oneself.

18
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,404
Even women have been known to enjoy
the privileges ofa flat.

19
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:11,684
Governesses, yes, but not
poor marriageable girls.

20
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:14,237
I even knew a girl
who once lived in a flat.

21
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,521
Oh, if I could only do over
my aunt's drawing room...

22
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,405
I should be a better woman.

23
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,326
Is it so bad?

24
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:23,718
That shows how seldom
you come there.

25
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,164
Why don't you come oftener?

26
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:30,836
When I do come, it's not to look
at Mrs Peniston's furniture.

27
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,116
Nonsense.

28
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,760
You don't come at all.

29
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,596
Yet we get on so well when we meet.

30
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,560
Cream or lemon?

31
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:39,523
Lemon.

32
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,519
I can't make you out.

33
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:46,677
Of course there are men who
dislike me...

34
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,277
and others who are afraid of me.

35
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,125
They think I want to marry them.

36
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:55,722
But I don't think you dislike me.

37
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,715
And you can't possibly think I want
to marry you.

38
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:01,003
No, I absolve you from that.

39
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:04,882
Well then?

40
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:07,277
Well, perhaps that's the reason.

41
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,121
The reason forwhat?

42
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,403
The fact you don'twant to marry
me.

43
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,997
Perhaps I don't see that as a
strong inducement to go see you.

44
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,486
Dear Mr Selden...

45
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,164
it's stupid of you to be
disingenuous...

46
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,478
and it's not like you to be stupid.

47
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,563
I've been about too long.

48
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,283
People are getting tired of me.

49
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,806
They're saying I ought to marry.

50
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,281
Isn't marriage yourvocation?

51
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,165
What you're all brought up for?

52
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,320
I suppose so.

53
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,607
So why not take the plunge and
have it over?

54
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,726
You collect, do you?

55
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,243
First editions and things?

56
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,242
And do you collect Americana?

57
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,883
No, that's ratherout of my line.

58
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,847
And Americana are horribly dull,
I suppose?

59
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,156
I should fancy so.

60
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,045
Except to the historian.

61
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,837
And yet they do fetch such fabulous
prices, don't they?

62
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,282
Oh, only the very rich can afford
to buy them.

63
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,558
And you knowthat I'm not rich.

64
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,323
But life is very expensive.

65
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,044
Do you mind not being rich?

66
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:48,955
And having towork...

67
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,482
do you mind that?

68
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,797
Oh, the work itself is not so bad.

69
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,243
I'm rather fond of the law.

70
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,796
But do you mind enough to have
to marry to get out of it?

71
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,036
God forbid.

72
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,767
You see, there's the difference.

73
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:06,357
A girl must, and a man if he
chooses.

74
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:10,324
Perhaps you'll meet your fate
tonight at the Trenor's.

75
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,244
I thought you might go there.

76
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:15,125
Those big parties bore me.

77
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:17,886
As they do me.

78
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,320
Then why go?

79
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:23,643
You forget...

80
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,638
it's part of the business.

81
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,719
Good luck at Bellmont.

82
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,556
Miss Bart?

83
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:51,760
Well, of all people.

84
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,997
Oh, Mr Rosedale.

85
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,282
Howare you?

86
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:56,926
Been up town doing some shopping?

87
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:57,758
Yes.

88
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:00,043
I came up to see my dressmaker.

89
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,801
I didn't know there were
any dressmakers at the Benedick.

90
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:03,962
That's the name of this building?

91
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:04,877
Yes.

92
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:06,275
I own it.

93
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,446
The name means
"confirmed bachelor".

94
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,676
I'm on my way to the Trenor's.

95
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,963
Let me take you to the station.

96
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:16,843
No.

97
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:17,883
Thank you.

98
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:18,957
You are very kind...

99
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:21,004
but I don't want to trouble you.

100
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,798
MrGryce, it's you.

101
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,965
The seat next to me is empty.

102
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:19,437
Do take it.

103
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:35,438
I suppose you're off to Bellmont.

104
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,723
Yes. For a week.

105
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:39,360
A whole week?

106
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:40,642
How delicious.

107
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,723
How are you getting on with your
Americana?

108
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,959
I've got a few new things.

109
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,956
Your uncle had a very fine
collection, I believe.

110
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,239
Yes, he collected for
a number of years, but...

111
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:05,403
I must have this seat, Lily...

112
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,804
Mr Gryce.

113
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,241
How do you do?

114
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,646
I came this morning from
Mount Kisco in the motor car.

115
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,957
Had to kick my heels at
Garrison's for an hour...

116
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:18,640
without even a cigarette.

117
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,002
I don't suppose you have
one left, have you, Lily?

118
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,078
What an absurd question, Bertha.

119
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:25,442
You don't smoke?

120
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,085
Sincewhen did you give it up?

121
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,675
You don't smoke either, Mr Gryce?

122
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,806
How stupid of me.

123
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,521
It was simply inhuman of Pragg
to go off now.

124
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,006
When I was in Tuxedo...

125
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,125
I asked a lot of people down and
I mislaid the list...

126
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,005
And I can't remember who's coming.

127
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,397
This week will be a failure too.

128
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:19,395
Judy, as if anybody's ever bored
at Bellmont.

129
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:20,522
Everything's gone wrong.

130
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,281
And now Bertha Dorset is
furious with me.

131
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,245
Furious with you? Why?

132
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,557
Because I told her Lawrence
Selden was coming, but...

133
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,685
hewouldn't after all and she's
unreasonable enough...

134
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,565
to believe it was my fault.

135
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,439
I thought thatwas all over.

136
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,757
Oh, so it is. On his side.

137
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,236
I shall call him on the telephone
and tell him he simply must come.

138
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,362
Oh, don't.

139
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,121
Good gracious, Lily.
Do you dislike him so much?

140
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,879
Not at all. I like him.

141
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,956
Oh, don't say there's
any real harm in Bertha...

142
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:54,001
but she delights in making people
miserable, especially her husband.

143
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:55,960
Poor George.

144
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,643
But she is dangerous.

145
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,405
And you are not nasty.

146
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,558
For always getting what she
wants...

147
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:08,321
commend me to a nastywoman.

148
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,917
l thought you were fond of Bertha.

149
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:12,401
Oh, I am.

150
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:16,077
It's much saferto be fond of
dangerous people.

151
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,805
Did you know his father made a
fortune...

152
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:30,795
out of inventing a device which
excludes fresh air from hotels?

153
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:31,843
Who?

154
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,316
Why to be sure, Lily.
Percy Gryce.

155
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,120
But he's horribly shy and
easily shocked...

156
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,045
Why don't you say it, Judy?

157
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:44,438
I have the reputation for being
on the hunt for a husband.

158
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,962
Lily, I asked him here
on purpose foryou.

159
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,084
Percy Gryce and I are becoming
very good friends.

160
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,360
You're sure you wouldn't like
me to telephone Lawrence Selden?

161
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:00,236
Quite sure.

162
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,437
I do enjoy the quiet.

163
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,800
Don't you, Lily?

164
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,957
I wish men would always stay away.

165
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,277
It's much nicerwithout them.

166
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,524
Oh, you don't count, George.

167
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,443
One never talks to one's husband.

168
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,396
But wives never like their husbands
talking to other women.

169
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:32,446
Only if the women in question are
slightly too eligible or divorced.

170
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,759
Wives may do as they wish.

171
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:39,001
Husbands are expected to be like
money, influential but silent.

172
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,003
If divorcees were more acceptable,
I might be tempted.

173
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:43,917
Gus! Oh dear.

174
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,563
You see, I came after all.

175
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:17,243
Thank you for keeping me from
playing bridge tonight, Mr Gryce.

176
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:18,886
Not at all, Miss Bart.

177
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:21,880
I have no head for the game or
the rules of betting.

178
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,003
I have been dragged into it
in the past...

179
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,397
and I have lost an appalling
amount of money.

180
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,761
Mr Gryce, I have shocked you.

181
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:32,556
Whilst I do not approve, Miss
Bart, I do approve of you.

182
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:34,759
I hope that means you forgive me.

183
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:36,685
For I am penitent.

184
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,999
Will you go to church tomorrow?

185
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:47,283
Yes.

186
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,003
May I accompany you, Miss Bart?

187
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:51,846
Of course, MrGryce.

188
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:55,562
Good night.

189
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,558
Good night, Miss Bart.

190
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,077
Dear me, am I late?

191
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,441
Late forwhat?

192
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:17,762
Late forwhom?

193
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:22,315
Perhaps you had an earlier
engagement?

194
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,281
Yes, I had.

195
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,478
Perhaps I am in theway then?

196
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:37,922
Mr Selden is at your disposal.

197
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,645
l never interferewith
Mr Selden's engagements.

198
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:44,356
But I have no engagement
with Mr Selden.

199
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,404
I was to go to church...

200
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:49,964
and I'm afraid that the carriages
have left without me.

201
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,039
Have they left, do you know?

202
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:55,166
Yes. I heard them drive away
some time ago.

203
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:00,164
Then I shall have towalk.

204
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:02,806
It's too late to get there.

205
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,880
Well, I'll have the credit for
trying at any rate.

206
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:47,999
You must be quite breathless.

207
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,235
How fast you walk.

208
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,999
Thought I'd never catch up.

209
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,476
But I've been sitting here
for nearly an hour!

210
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,320
Waiting for me, I hope.

211
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:59,678
Waiting to see ifyou'd come.

212
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:01,605
Weren't you sure I would?

213
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,837
If I waited long enough.

214
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:07,158
But I only had a limited time
to give to the experience.

215
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,396
Why ''limited''?

216
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:09,966
By my other engagement.

217
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:18,841
Now I see why you were
getting up on yourAmericana.

218
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,043
That's why I was waiting for you.

219
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,922
To thank you for giving me so many
points.

220
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,676
You can hardly dojustice to the
subject in so short a time.

221
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,003
Won't you devote the afternoon to
it?

222
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:34,405
We'll take a walk and you can
thank me at your leisure.

223
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,166
Let us sit here.

224
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:57,085
I have broken two engagements for
you today...

225
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,602
both of them with Percy Gryce.

226
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,565
How many have you broken for me?

227
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:04,557
None.

228
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:07,241
My only engagement at Bellmont
was with you.

229
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,643
You really came to Bellmont
to see me?

230
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:12,842
Of course I did.

231
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:14,563
Why?

232
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:17,962
l like to seewhat
you're doing.

233
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:20,277
You're such awonderful spectacle.

234
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:25,117
Well, now you're here, you can
see the effect first-hand.

235
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,437
I don't think that my coming...

236
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,041
has deflected your course of action
at all.

237
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,756
Give me one. I haven't smoked in
days.

238
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,043
Why such unnatural abstinence?

239
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,996
It is not considered becoming in a
'jeune fille a marier'.

240
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:42,999
And at the present moment...

241
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,681
I am a 'jeune fille a marier'.

242
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,723
You must suppose me a
dull kind of person...

243
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,525
If you think I never yield
to an impulse.

244
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:55,166
But I don't suppose that.

245
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,723
Your genius lies in converting
impulses into intentions.

246
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:00,641
My genius?

247
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:04,357
My genius would appear to be my
ability...

248
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,087
to do the wrong thing
at the right time.

249
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,646
Or vice-versa.

250
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:16,006
Is there any final test of genius
but success?

251
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,238
I certainly haven't succeeded.

252
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:22,001
But you will marry
someone very rich.

253
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:25,360
What a miserable future you foresee
for me.

254
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,124
Haven't you seen it for yourself?

255
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:29,602
Of course.

256
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:34,957
But it seems so much darker when
you show it to me.

257
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,486
Why do you do this to me?

258
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:46,206
Why do you make the things that l
have chosen seem hateful to me...

259
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:49,202
if you have nothing
to give me instead?

260
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,835
No. I have nothing to give you.

261
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,766
If I had, it'd be yours,
you know that.

262
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:03,520
But you belittle me, being so sure
they're the only things I care for.

263
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:10,246
Isn't it natural for me to belittle
everything I can't offer you?

264
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,285
Do you want to marry me?

265
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,561
No, I don't.

266
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:37,038
But perhaps I should
ifyou did.

267
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,244
It would be a great risk.

268
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:46,687
I've never concealed how great.

269
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,440
You are a coward.

270
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:01,797
No.

271
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,444
It's you who are the coward.

272
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,640
Are you serious?

273
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:22,596
Why not?

274
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,957
i took no risk in being so.

275
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,317
Why is it that when we meet...

276
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,644
we always play this
elaborate game?

277
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:53,800
It's getting late.

278
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,566
Let us go down.

279
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:07,886
l thought Mr Gryce meant
to stay all week.

280
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,003
He did, that's the worst of it.

281
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,045
It shows he's running away
from you.

282
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:15,681
Bertha's done her work and
poisoned him.

283
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:18,841
What was it Bertha really
told Percy?

284
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:20,599
Don't ask me. Horrors.

285
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:25,364
All I can say is, Lily, that l
can't make you out.

286
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:27,877
He's not completely lost.

287
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:29,361
There are ways.

288
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,882
Whatever you do, do nothing.

289
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:37,237
Lily, you'll never do anything
if you're not serious.

290
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,156
Out of spirits?

291
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,041
I'm a little dull.

292
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:45,847
Is your last box of Doucet
dresses a failure...

293
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:48,601
ordid my wife rook you for
everything at bridge?

294
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:52,402
I have to give up Doucet
dresses and bridge.

295
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:55,041
I can't afford either any more.

296
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,323
And Judy thinks me a bore.

297
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:00,683
Fact is, she's angry with me.

298
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,123
Angrywith you? Nonsense.
Mywife's devoted to you.

299
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:07,956
She's my very best friend, and
that's why I mind vexing her.

300
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,758
I want to make my peace with her.

301
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:14,001
She has her heart set on my
marrying money.

302
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,160
Agreat deal of money.

303
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,165
You don't mean Percy Gryce?

304
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:19,842
Good Lord.

305
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,277
How could Judy think you'd
do such a thing?

306
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,519
Sometimes I think a man...

307
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:27,759
understands a woman's motives
betterthan herown sex does.

308
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,475
Good Lord. I could've
told Judy that.

309
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:33,001
Oh, by the way, Miss Lily...

310
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,727
I wish you'd try to persuade
Judy to be civil to Rosedale.

311
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:38,606
I did a neat stroke of business
through him lastweek.

312
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,962
If she'd only ask him to come
and dine now and then...

313
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:43,163
I'd get almost anything out of him.

314
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:47,441
He's going to be richer than
all of us one ofthese days.

315
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,164
Would you do me a favour?

316
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:57,886
A very great favour?

317
00:23:58,247 --> 00:23:59,282
Why, of course.

318
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:02,116
I don't mean to bore you with all
this...

319
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,881
but I'm entirely dependent on my
aunt...

320
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:09,003
and though she's very kind,
she gives me no regular allowance.

321
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:13,078
I have a tiny income of my own
but it's been badly invested.

322
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,241
Seems to bring in less each year.

323
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,965
And recently I've lost money at
cards.

324
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,721
I've paid off my debts,
ofcourse, but...

325
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,843
I dare not tell my aunt.

326
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:30,004
I can no longergo on living my
present life.

327
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,844
And Percy Gryce?

328
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:35,643
I can't make that sort of marriage.

329
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:40,075
You gave him the sack, and that's
why he left by train this morning?

330
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:48,002
I can make you a handsome sum
without endangering your capital.

331
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,282
I am so ignorant about money
matters...

332
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:55,042
and I'd be so grateful to
have a good advisor.

333
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:57,001
Leave it to me.

334
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:58,806
I'll find a solution.

335
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:05,481
Really, Lily...

336
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,238
you're as careless and frivolous
as your poor parents were.

337
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,838
Why do you go to Bellmont...

338
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,043
if you don't rememberwhat happened
orwhom you saw there.

339
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,159
But therewas no one new.

340
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,158
Just the usual throng.

341
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:20,245
Was Mr Selden there?

342
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:22,757
Yes. He came later.

343
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,761
And Mr Rosedale,
was he there?

344
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:27,076
No, of course not.

345
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:28,955
Why do you ask?

346
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:31,558
Passing interest, merely.

347
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,524
Mr Selden tells me that socially
Mr Rosedale...

348
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:37,359
is very ubiquitous now.

349
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:40,155
I have always thought that
men like Rosedale...

350
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:42,283
and their methods of gaining
fortunes...

351
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:45,280
were at best, questionable,
at worst, criminal.

352
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,522
To grow richer...

353
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:50,202
at a time when most people's
investments are shrinking...

354
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,085
strikes me as very bad taste.

355
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:54,841
But society still uses such men,
ifonly obliquely.

356
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:59,125
If obliquity were a vice
we should all be tainted.

357
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:03,406
Only someonewithout family could
make such a vulgar remark.

358
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,123
Aunt Julia, you are my family.

359
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,441
Just as I thought.

360
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:37,757
Extraordinary that I can't teach
the parlour-maid...

361
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:39,758
to draw the blinds down evenly.

362
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:41,918
Will you see to it, Grace?

363
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:44,926
Jennings, we'll take tea
in the upstairs sitting room.

364
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:47,398
Lily, you read me the obituaries.

365
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:51,400
Aunt Julia, Grace does it
so much better than me.

366
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:55,961
She can make the most insignificant
death seem interesting.

367
00:26:58,447 --> 00:26:59,880
I'll see to the blinds.

368
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:02,322
Verywell, you mayjoin us later.

369
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:32,123
It's a Mrs Haffen, Miss.

370
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:34,523
Shewon't say what she wants.

371
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,640
You want to see me?

372
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:42,642
Something you might like to see.

373
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:45,319
You have something belonging to me?

374
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:48,195
Not exactly.

375
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:50,916
I don't understand.

376
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:53,157
If it's not mine,
then why are you here?

377
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,358
When I worked at the Benedick...

378
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,640
I was in charge of cleaning the
gentlemen's rooms.

379
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,437
Most gentlemen are careful about
the letters they get.

380
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:08,162
Burn them in winter, tear them
into bits in summer.

381
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:13,442
But Mr Selden wasn't
so particular.

382
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,478
I know nothing ofthese letters.

383
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,760
I have no idea why you've
brought them here.

384
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:25,281
To sell them.

385
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:30,119
I saw you coming out of
Mr Selden's rooms.

386
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,520
So I guessed they were worth
more to you than me.

387
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,479
You promised me we'd meet...

388
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:56,399
when George was away from town.

389
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,035
Although you've forbidden me
to come to you, I will.

390
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,437
I cannot bear George near me.

391
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,359
If he touches me I want to scream.

392
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:05,916
His very presence is unbearable.

393
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:15,206
My darling Lawrence, you are
my consolation, my only joy.

394
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:20,326
In you I find more freedom and
support than I've ever known.

395
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:22,838
Your devoted Bertha.

396
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,917
What do you want for them?

397
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:34,279
One hundred and fifty.

398
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:35,881
One hundred.

399
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:37,840
I've got to live too.

400
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:41,761
I've offered you all that I'm
prepared to pay for the letters.

401
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:46,722
One hundred.

402
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,237
If you would forgive your enemy...

403
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,922
first inflict a hurt on them.

404
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,595
Oh, Bertha.

405
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:50,201
How could you have been so
indiscreet.

406
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:56,516
l now pronounce you man and wife.

407
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:07,883
Never seen you look more lovely.

408
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,561
Oh, Gus.

409
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,278
Lily, I've got a cheque for you.

410
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,516
Another dividend?

411
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,480
You have both Rosedale and me
to thank for it.

412
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,366
I've made you five thousand
on his tip...

413
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:25,280
And re-invested four
on your behalf.

414
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:27,642
With promise ofanother big rise.

415
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:28,637
Well...

416
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:30,957
I can't thank you properly now.

417
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:34,881
I don't want to be thanked. I want
you to be nice to Rosedale and me.

418
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:37,083
I'd like to see you now and then.

419
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,965
Come on overto Bellmont.

420
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:40,276
I'll send the motor.

421
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,244
You say the most absurd things.

422
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:44,439
Besides, it's impossible.

423
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,205
My aunt is back in town...

424
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,005
and I must stay with her.

425
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,317
You must come...

426
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:53,921
to see Mrs Peniston and l
next time you are in town.

427
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:57,956
Then you can tell me how to better
invest my small fortune.

428
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,719
This is luck.

429
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,080
I was wondering if I'd be able
to have aword with you.

430
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,397
I haven't recovered my self-
respect...

431
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,922
since you showed me how poor
my ambitions were.

432
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:28,761
On the contrary...

433
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:30,406
I thought I had been
the means of proving...

434
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,717
they were more important to you
than anything else.

435
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:34,243
Lily.

436
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,559
We thought you'd given us the slip.

437
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:38,479
Been hunting all overfor you.

438
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:41,277
I wanted to invite you to my box...

439
00:33:41,447 --> 00:33:43,642
at the opera
on opening night.

440
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,965
Gus has promised to come
to town on purpose.

441
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:49,325
He's a tremendous admirerof yours.

442
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,406
I fancy he'd go a lot farther for
the pleasure of seeing you.

443
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,883
The Trenors are my best friends.

444
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,686
l think we'd all go a long way
to see one other.

445
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:03,245
How's your luck been
lately on Wall street?

446
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:07,003
I hear Gus pulled off a nice
little pile foryou last month.

447
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,598
I had a little money to invest...

448
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:12,725
and Mr Trenor has been helping me
in such matters.

449
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,885
I had a lucky turn.

450
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:16,446
Is that what you call it?

451
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:19,682
You've had a great many yourself.

452
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:25,600
Is that the latest creation of the
dressmaker at the Benedick?

453
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,519
If so, it's a great success.

454
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:29,326
Isn't it, MrSelden?

455
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:33,566
That's nice of you.

456
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:37,602
It'd be nicer still ifyou'd
get me a glass of lemonade.

457
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:40,076
Pleasure.

458
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,957
They met six weeks ago at Bertha
Dorset's...

459
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,044
and have been devoted ever since.

460
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:02,602
The engagement's to be
announced next week.

461
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:06,797
They say it'll be the nicest
marriage possible.

462
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,755
One dull fortune
marrying another.

463
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,922
Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce?

464
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,636
Well, well.

465
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,121
Ladies and gentlemen...

466
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,278
Miss Lily Bart, as 'summer'
byWatteau.

467
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,478
She's never looked so radiant.

468
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,362
l like her best in that simple
dress.

469
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,517
Makes her look like the real Lily.

470
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:59,006
The Lily I know.

471
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:00,675
The Lilywe know.

472
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,197
She's herselfwith a few people
only.

473
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:07,159
She has it in her to become
whatever she's believed to be.

474
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:10,042
We must think the best of her.

475
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,446
I'll tell her that.

476
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,084
She always says you dislike her.

477
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:19,998
Well, Grace. How's life at
Richfield?

478
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:21,683
Quiet.

479
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,477
Aunt Peniston sees very little
company.

480
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,797
I'm sure your being there
gave her much pleasure.

481
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,761
I am as reliable
as roast mutton.

482
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,405
But Aunt Julia is not alone...

483
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,081
in preferring Lily's
erratic brilliance.

484
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:38,646
You should marry, Grace.

485
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,997
We should all marry,
MrSelden.

486
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:48,199
You never speak to me.

487
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,717
I'm never near you enough.

488
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,404
You think hard things of me.

489
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,520
l think of you...

490
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,160
at any rate.

491
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:27,037
Why do we never see each other?

492
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,443
I have my law practice and...

493
00:37:33,607 --> 00:37:36,519
you're always surrounded
by admirers.

494
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:41,281
There's no admirers at my aunt's.

495
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:46,482
Well...

496
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:50,963
then, perhaps I might take
tea with you.

497
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,366
At Mrs Peniston's
next week?

498
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:56,117
Yes.

499
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,119
Come at four on Friday.

500
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:04,286
Then we can talk.

501
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:08,364
I've so much to say to you.

502
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,085
I need your help.

503
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:18,683
You promised me once you'd help me.

504
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,037
The only way I can help you...

505
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:27,319
is by loving you.

506
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:18,202
Love me.

507
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:22,880
But don't tell me so.

508
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,079
I'd hate to miss the train.

509
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:10,044
Selden, going too?

510
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,084
-Aren't you staying for supper?
-No.

511
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,000
When people crowd their rooms so
you can't get nearanyone...

512
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:17,078
you wish to speak to I'd sooner go.

513
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,638
My wife was right to stay away.

514
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:23,118
She says life is too short to spend
it breaking new people in.

515
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,242
Thank you.

516
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,643
Lily and Gus Trenor, you say?

517
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:42,599
Aunt, of course I don't mean...

518
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,598
Then what do you mean, Grace?

519
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,117
Do people say he's in love with
her?

520
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,562
People always say
unpleasant things.

521
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,279
It's a pity, though, that Lily
makes herself so conspicuous.

522
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:55,596
Conspicuous?

523
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,842
Does he mean to divorce
then marry her?

524
00:41:59,007 --> 00:41:59,883
No, it's...

525
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:01,356
it's a flirtation.

526
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:02,562
Nothing more.

527
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:03,796
A flirtation?

528
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:05,879
With a married man?

529
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:09,001
Such things were never heard of in
my day.

530
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:26,561
Look here, Lily...

531
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:29,400
Judy and I've been in town for
weeks. When am I going to see you?

532
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,876
You can find me any afternoon
at my aunt's.

533
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:34,677
Come see me there and
we can have a quiet talk.

534
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:37,243
You put me offwith that at the
Van Osburgh wedding.

535
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:40,923
Truth is, now you've got what you
wanted you'd rather not see me.

536
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:42,486
Don't be foolish, Gus.

537
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,956
If you want to see me
you can come to my aunt's.

538
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:54,359
What else is being said?

539
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:59,560
That Gus Trenor pays her bills.

540
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:00,477
Rubbish.

541
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:02,360
Lily has herown income.

542
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,478
And I provide for her handsomely.

543
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:06,484
There are hergambling debts.

544
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,686
What do you mean?

545
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:11,479
She plays bridge.

546
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:16,356
Who told you my niece plays
cards for money?

547
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:20,236
Mrs Gryce told me that it
was Lily's gambling debts...

548
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:21,635
that frightened Percy.

549
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:25,324
In fact people are inclined to
excuse her on that account.

550
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:27,079
Excuse herforwhat?

551
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:32,917
Foraccepting the attentions of
men like Gus Trenor.

552
00:43:36,687 --> 00:43:38,564
Thank you fortelling me, Grace.

553
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:41,961
But I must say, this unwelcome
information...

554
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:44,243
has ruined the Mozart for me.

555
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:50,245
Lily, let's leave before the first
act starts.

556
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:53,160
Judy's as cross as two sticks when
she's away from Bellmont.

557
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:54,521
Come to the house now.

558
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:56,120
Is Judy unwell?

559
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,482
A visit from you might be just
what's needed.

560
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:02,960
Very well, Gus.

561
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:04,715
I shall come with you.

562
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:51,560
Doesn't it look as if we're waiting
for the body to be brought down?

563
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:56,156
Where's Judy?

564
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,643
She's not up to seeing anybody.

565
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,641
You mean to say she's not well
enough to see me?

566
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:07,356
Devil of a headache.

567
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:09,526
Quite knocked out by it.

568
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:13,199
In that case, will you have the
goodness to call me a cab?

569
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:15,120
Why must you go?

570
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:18,157
It's late and we are alone.

571
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,325
I must insist.

572
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,282
Always the same old story.

573
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:28,324
Can't give me five minutes but
you're charming to others.

574
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:33,876
I only went to that stupid
opera to be with you.

575
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:36,117
I insist that you call me a cab.

576
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:38,806
Suppose I won't?

577
00:45:39,247 --> 00:45:40,362
What then?

578
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:43,441
If you force me I shall
go upstairs to Judy.

579
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:47,516
Sit down.

580
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,200
I've got aword to say to you.

581
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:53,996
If you have anything to say to me
you must say it at another time.

582
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:58,326
I shall go upstairs to Judy unless
you call me a cab at once.

583
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:01,887
Go upstairs, Judy isn't there.

584
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:06,842
You mean to say that Judy
is not in this house?

585
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:08,639
She isn't even in town.

586
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:09,916
I don't believe you.

587
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:11,440
My wife's still at Bellmont.

588
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,643
If she were not coming to town
she would have telephoned.

589
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:14,444
She did.

590
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:15,926
I received no message.

591
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,486
I didn't send any.

592
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:20,076
How dare you compromise me in this
way?

593
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,283
Don't take that high tone with me.

594
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:24,723
I've been patient long enough.

595
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:26,236
After all...

596
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:29,604
if you pay for the dinner you're
allowed to sit at the table.

597
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,405
I don't know what you mean.

598
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:34,485
I didn't begin this business.

599
00:46:34,647 --> 00:46:35,841
Kept out ofthe way.

600
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:38,237
But I can see fast enough when
I'm being made a fool of.

601
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:42,955
Nowyou've got what you wanted,
Gus isn't needed any more.

602
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:44,924
Well that isn't playing fair, Lily.

603
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:47,083
It's dodging the rules of the game.

604
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:49,325
And now you've got to pay.

605
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:51,876
You mean I owe you money?

606
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,963
You told me it was all right.

607
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:57,359
It was all right. It is all right.

608
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,199
You're welcome to it. All of it.

609
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:01,643
I just want to be thanked a little.

610
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:03,160
I have thanked you!

611
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,157
Or do you wish for payment in kind?

612
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:10,437
No!

613
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:14,758
If I owe you money, I'll pay you!

614
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,123
You owe me nine thousand dollars.

615
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,316
Nine thousand?

616
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:32,037
I will pay you.

617
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,280
I suppose you'll go to Selden or
Rosedale for it.

618
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:38,475
Unless you've settled those
scores already...

619
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,638
and I'm the only one left out
in the cold.

620
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,518
What more do you have to say to me?

621
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:48,163
Go home.

622
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,520
Come here Lily.

623
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:27,564
I wish to speak to you.

624
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:31,645
Ant Julia, it's very late
and I am very tired.

625
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:34,082
I must insist, Lily.

626
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:52,965
You're a bad colour, Lily.

627
00:48:56,327 --> 00:48:59,842
This incessant rushing about is
beginning to tell on you.

628
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,839
I don't think it's that.

629
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,204
I've had otherworries.

630
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,321
The fact is...

631
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,600
I owe some money.

632
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:30,477
I...

633
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:33,686
I've been foolish.

634
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:38,444
There are bills that are pressing.

635
00:49:39,247 --> 00:49:42,239
I paid your dressmaker's bill
last October.

636
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:45,803
But if you owe Madame Celeste
anotherthousand dollars...

637
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:48,077
She may send me youraccount.

638
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:52,885
It's a good deal more than that.

639
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:55,558
A good deal more?

640
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:57,517
Towhom?

641
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:59,520
Do I knowthese people?

642
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:02,599
Some by name,
others by reputation.

643
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,958
Then they're of no consequence.

644
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,482
These debts I speak of
are different.

645
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:09,836
The fact is...

646
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,077
I've been playing cards.

647
00:50:14,247 --> 00:50:15,475
It's true then?

648
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:18,757
You play cards for money?

649
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:21,518
Do you play on Sundays?

650
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,042
You're hard on me, Aunt Julia.

651
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:26,643
l never really cared for cards...

652
00:50:26,807 --> 00:50:28,877
and one hates to be thought
priggish and one...

653
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:30,799
drifts into doing what others do.

654
00:50:34,687 --> 00:50:36,962
I've had a dreadful lesson.

655
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:42,081
If you help me out, I promise...

656
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,839
You needn't make any promises.

657
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,201
It's unnecessary.

658
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:47,365
When I offered you a home...

659
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:50,166
I didn't undertake to pay
your gambling debts.

660
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:53,481
Aunt Julia, you mean
that you won't help me?

661
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:56,366
I shall certainly not do anything
to give the impression...

662
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:58,040
that I countenance your behaviour.

663
00:50:58,207 --> 00:51:00,357
Aunt Julia, I will be disgraced!

664
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:04,596
I consider that you are
disgraced, Lily.

665
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:10,437
And now I must ask you to leave me.

666
00:51:12,007 --> 00:51:14,680
This scene has been
extremely painful to me...

667
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:18,682
and I have my own health
to consider.

668
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:34,884
And tell Jennings I wish to see no-
one until tomorrow afternoon.

669
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:37,722
And then only Grace Stepney.

670
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:39,397
Grace?

671
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:44,522
Yes, Aunt Julia.

672
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:22,439
Lily, it's after midnight.

673
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,086
What will Aunt Julia think?

674
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:26,122
I don't care.

675
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:29,445
I couldn't go to my room.

676
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:32,516
I hate it so.

677
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:40,763
Lily, what's happened?

678
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,720
Can't you tell me?

679
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:46,921
l thought I could
manage my own life...

680
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,602
But I've been so foolish, Grace.

681
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:54,636
To the point of being compromised.

682
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:56,796
Bywhom?

683
00:52:58,127 --> 00:52:59,446
Mr Selden?

684
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:03,087
No, not Mr Selden.

685
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:09,925
I've been careless and imprudent
about money.

686
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:16,445
I'm frightened to think what I owe.

687
00:53:22,727 --> 00:53:24,319
Grace, you know Lawrence.

688
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,357
If I asked him to help me...

689
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:30,360
told him why...

690
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:35,359
would he loathe me if I told
him everything?

691
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,123
No.

692
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:39,320
You must not do that.

693
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,078
He is like other men.

694
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:48,365
They have minds like moral
fly-paper.

695
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:53,240
They can forgive a woman almost
anything except losing her name.

696
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:57,444
If you wish to keep your
reputation intact, Lily...

697
00:53:59,087 --> 00:54:00,566
tell him nothing.

698
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:03,640
But he must've spoken about me.

699
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:07,718
What does he really think of me?

700
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,078
We've never discussed you, Lily.

701
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,721
I have no ideawhat
Mr Selden thinks.

702
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:21,363
But I must trust in his good faith.

703
00:54:24,247 --> 00:54:26,841
I'll write him and ask him to come.

704
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:39,925
Goodnight, Grace.

705
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:43,246
Goodnight, Lily.

706
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,316
Lawrence!

707
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:01,682
Lawrence!

708
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:40,281
Jennings. Is my aunt downstairs?

709
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:41,675
No, Miss Bart.

710
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:45,796
Mrs Peniston left for Richfield
early this morning...

711
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,241
with Miss Stepney.

712
00:55:49,727 --> 00:55:50,603
Thank you.

713
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:56,763
Would you see that the boy delivers
this to Mr Selden at the Benedick?

714
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,882
Yes, Miss.

715
00:55:58,047 --> 00:55:59,765
Would you serve tea at four...

716
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:02,999
in the downstairs sitting room and
show Mr Selden in when he arrives?

717
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:04,236
Yes, Miss Bart.

718
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:04,759
Thank you.

719
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,556
Mr Rosedale.

720
00:56:59,007 --> 00:57:00,486
Pretty well done.

721
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,126
Yes, very well done.

722
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:19,998
Why put up this kind of bluff?

723
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,885
Why aren't you straight with me?

724
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:30,003
l know there have been times
when you've been worried.

725
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:33,476
A girl like you shouldn't have
worries.

726
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:37,002
You're quite right, Mr Rosedale.

727
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,445
I have had worries.

728
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,837
I've been careless about money.

729
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:48,476
I'm offering you the chance to turn
your back on that once and for all.

730
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:52,757
I know you're not in love with me.

731
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:55,285
You're not even fond of me.

732
00:57:56,447 --> 00:57:57,357
Yet.

733
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:03,881
I'm very much flattered by your
offer...

734
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,842
but I should be selfish and
ungrateful...

735
00:58:08,007 --> 00:58:11,158
if I made my reason for accepting
your generosity financial.

736
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:14,686
Miss Bart...

737
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:17,796
I generally get what
I want in life.

738
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:22,760
I have a certain social position
and the means to maintain it.

739
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:25,404
Now all I want is the woman...

740
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:29,757
the right woman, to share both
with me.

741
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:35,246
You're fond of luxury and amusement
and to not have to settle for it.

742
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:38,279
I can provide the style...

743
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,526
and the means of settling.

744
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:45,878
You're mistaken on one point...

745
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:47,440
Mr Rosedale.

746
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:50,405
Whatever I enjoy...

747
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:52,604
I'm prepared to pay for.

748
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:04,242
I have spoken too plainly.

749
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:06,364
I didn't mean to give offence.

750
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:08,518
Give me time to consider your
kindness.

751
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:10,526
Goodbye, Miss Bart.

752
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:13,278
You will consider my proposal?

753
00:59:13,607 --> 00:59:14,596
Of course.

754
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:52,443
Yes?

755
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:54,120
Are you alone, Lily?

756
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:57,519
Yes, quite alone, Bertha.

757
00:59:58,327 --> 00:59:59,840
Everyone has gone away.

758
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:03,480
My aunt to Richfield,
everyone else to Europe.

759
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:06,445
Except Lawrence Selden, who's gone
to London.

760
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,484
How unsophisticated of him.

761
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,400
Will you join us then on a cruise
to the Mediterranean?

762
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:13,963
Well, I'm not sure I'm able to.

763
01:00:14,127 --> 01:00:15,845
You'll be doing me a great service.

764
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:17,918
You're always good with George...

765
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:21,238
listening to the stories he's been
telling since the Civil War.

766
01:00:21,407 --> 01:00:23,363
You're the only one with enough
fortitude to take an interest.

767
01:00:23,527 --> 01:00:24,482
Nonsense.

768
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:26,444
George can be charming.

769
01:00:26,607 --> 01:00:28,245
Good. You'll come then?

770
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:30,642
Yes. It'll be delightful.

771
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:32,916
Goodbye.

772
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:38,515
MrSelden.

773
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,001
Mrs Fisher.

774
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,006
Dojoin us.

775
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,125
What brings you to Monte Carlo?

776
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:47,721
I finished my business with a
client in London...

777
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:51,516
and decided to come down and renew
my objective interest in life.

778
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:54,076
So you're not so far removed from
being manipulated...

779
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,681
by the strings of society
as one might think.

780
01:03:56,847 --> 01:03:58,963
Mrs Fisher, none of us are.

781
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:04,959
We're starving to death because we
can't decide where to lunch.

782
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:07,880
One gets the best things at ''The
Terrasse''...

783
01:04:08,607 --> 01:04:10,916
but all the Americans go there now.

784
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:16,078
I do believe the Dorsets are back.

785
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:19,526
It's their yacht...

786
01:04:20,287 --> 01:04:21,515
"The Sabrina"

787
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:23,322
Oh, yes.

788
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:33,039
I often have this strange and
vivid dream...

789
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:36,997
of an unknown woman
whom I love and who loves me...

790
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:39,681
and who, each time,
is neither exactly the same...

791
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:43,639
nor exactly different but
who loves me and understand me.

792
01:04:43,807 --> 01:04:47,197
For she understands me and
my heart is transparent...

793
01:04:47,407 --> 01:04:50,956
to her alone, alasl
Which ceases to be a problem...

794
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:55,160
to her alone, and the sweat
of my pale brow.

795
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,996
She alone knows
how to cool it with tears.

796
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:03,965
Is she brunette,
blonde or red-head?

797
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,925
He's reading Verlaine to her now.

798
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:11,602
In French.

799
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:44,637
What's the use of mincing matters?

800
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,646
We all know what Bertha brought
Lily abroad for.

801
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:50,446
The Silverton affair is
at the acute stage.

802
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:52,643
George needs to be distracted.

803
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,560
And I'm sure Lily distracts him.

804
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:58,801
A clever woman would know when
to play her cards right.

805
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,841
But she's never been clever in
that way.

806
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:04,357
I hope there hasn't been
a row.

807
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:24,521
Where the devil are they?

808
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:27,837
Bertha!

809
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:30,082
Bertha!

810
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,443
How did you find London,
Mr Selden?

811
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,164
More agreeable than NewYork?

812
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,476
In someways, yes.

813
01:07:21,687 --> 01:07:23,917
Nevertheless, I came to see you.

814
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:25,042
To see me?

815
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,284
Or to see an older friend?

816
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:29,364
I beg you to leave the yacht.

817
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:30,596
To leave?

818
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:32,435
Why? What has happened?

819
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:35,917
Nothing. But if something should,
why be in the way of it?

820
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:38,363
How do you think I'd leave Bertha?

821
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:40,923
You have yourself to think of now.

822
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:44,046
Nothing will happen.

823
01:07:45,527 --> 01:07:47,324
Of course not. I'm sure.

824
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:03,236
Have you seen Bertha?

825
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:04,238
No.

826
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:06,206
Is she not up yet?

827
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:07,597
Not up yet!

828
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,121
Has she gone to bed?

829
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:13,277
You know what time she came
aboard this morning?

830
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:14,636
At seven!

831
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,002
Seven?

832
01:08:16,287 --> 01:08:17,515
Was there an accident?

833
01:08:17,687 --> 01:08:19,439
There was no accident.

834
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:21,165
I waited for them all night.

835
01:08:22,087 --> 01:08:24,555
Why didn't you call me
to share your vigil?

836
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:27,522
You wouldn't have liked the
denouement.

837
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:29,322
The denouement?

838
01:08:30,087 --> 01:08:33,079
Isn't that too big a word for
such a small incident?

839
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:33,997
Don't!

840
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,363
Don't!

841
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:40,765
I only want to help you.

842
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:44,680
You do so by being sweet
and patientwith me.

843
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,997
You can't want to see me
ridiculous.

844
01:08:48,887 --> 01:08:52,038
If it hadn't been for you I'd
have ended it long ago.

845
01:08:54,447 --> 01:08:55,721
I'll go to see Selden.

846
01:08:55,927 --> 01:08:56,757
No!

847
01:08:58,327 --> 01:08:59,157
No.

848
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:01,122
Why not?

849
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:04,043
One lawyer is as good as another.

850
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:07,357
Very well.

851
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:09,924
Go and see Mr Selden then.

852
01:09:12,287 --> 01:09:14,596
You'll have time before dinner.

853
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:36,597
I ought to say good morning.

854
01:09:39,247 --> 01:09:41,681
l tried to see you but
you weren't up.

855
01:09:42,247 --> 01:09:44,044
No. I got to bed late.

856
01:09:46,207 --> 01:09:49,085
Afterwe separated during the
fete, we thoughtwe should wait...

857
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:50,879
butwe missed you.

858
01:09:52,047 --> 01:09:53,446
You missed us?

859
01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:56,800
But I thought you didn't get back
to the yacht until this morning.

860
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:00,080
Who told you that?

861
01:10:00,287 --> 01:10:01,197
George.

862
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,486
Is that his version?

863
01:10:09,087 --> 01:10:10,236
Poor George.

864
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:13,564
He's had one of his attacks again.

865
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:17,283
It's very bad for him to be
worried.

866
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:20,644
Anything upsetting always brings
on an attack.

867
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:23,797
''Anything upsetting''?

868
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,563
Yes.

869
01:10:26,247 --> 01:10:28,397
Such as having you so
conspicuously on his hands...

870
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:30,717
during the small hours.

871
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:35,843
You know, my dear, you're
rather a responsibility...

872
01:10:36,047 --> 01:10:38,402
in such a scandalous place after
midnight.

873
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:40,083
Well really...

874
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:43,958
considering you burdened him with
that responsibility.

875
01:10:47,207 --> 01:10:50,483
A married man should not have the
burden of being seen alone...

876
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,080
with a single woman.

877
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:54,765
Yes, we were alone.

878
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:56,685
Is that so dreadful?

879
01:10:57,327 --> 01:11:00,922
After all, we lost you as much
as you mislaid us.

880
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:06,805
So now it is my fault...

881
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,765
for not having the superhuman
cleverness to find you...

882
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:11,599
in that dreadful crowd?

883
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,485
Or the imagination to believe...

884
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:17,560
that you wouldn't wait for us on
the quay until we met you?

885
01:11:17,727 --> 01:11:20,366
No, simply by us
all keeping together!

886
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:23,961
''Keeping together''?

887
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:28,485
Lily, you are not a child
to be led by the hand.

888
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:30,839
Nor to be lectured, Bertha.

889
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:33,716
Lecture you?

890
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:37,315
Heaven forbid.

891
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:40,521
I was merely trying to give you
a friendly hint.

892
01:11:43,487 --> 01:11:46,160
It's usually the other way round.
I'm expected to take hints...

893
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:48,124
not to give them.

894
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:52,077
Hints?

895
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:54,036
From me to you?

896
01:11:55,407 --> 01:11:57,284
Negative ones merely.

897
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,525
What not to be or to do
or to see.

898
01:12:02,927 --> 01:12:06,886
But if you'll let me say so...

899
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:10,322
I didn't knowone of my negative
duties...

900
01:12:10,487 --> 01:12:14,321
was not to warn you when you took
your imprudence too far.

901
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:53,126
Did you see George today?

902
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:54,563
Yes.

903
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:56,761
Well...

904
01:12:57,047 --> 01:12:58,241
What happened?

905
01:12:58,847 --> 01:13:00,075
What will happen?

906
01:13:00,647 --> 01:13:02,126
Nothing, as yet.

907
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:04,679
And nothing in the future.

908
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:06,722
You're sure?

909
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,686
I'm not sure, but I'm
a good deal surer.

910
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:10,956
No, thank you.

911
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:14,797
Assume everything
is as usual.

912
01:13:30,567 --> 01:13:32,683
Before I go I want to
leave you the Brys.

913
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:35,437
Charming ofyou to remember me.

914
01:13:35,607 --> 01:13:36,437
What you really mean is...

915
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:39,075
that you've snubbed the Brys
and you know they know it.

916
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:39,997
Carry!

917
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,964
If you'd have even managed to
have them invited...

918
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:43,162
onto "The Sabrina" once.

919
01:13:43,327 --> 01:13:45,158
Especially when royalty was
coming.

920
01:13:48,447 --> 01:13:51,245
Stay over and I'll get the
Duchess to dine with them.

921
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:52,840
I shan't stay over.

922
01:13:53,007 --> 01:13:56,556
The Gormers have paid for
my salon-lit and I leave tonight.

923
01:13:56,727 --> 01:13:58,001
But get her to dine with them all
the same.

924
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:02,638
I've danced all my life, you're my
husband.

925
01:14:03,087 --> 01:14:04,839
They'd be much obliged.

926
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:31,996
Do you sing?

927
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:33,802
Really?

928
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:40,405
Lily, if you're offto the yacht.

929
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:46,635
Miss Bart is not returning to the
yacht.

930
01:14:50,287 --> 01:14:51,242
Bertha...

931
01:14:54,527 --> 01:14:55,755
Miss Bart...

932
01:14:56,207 --> 01:14:57,799
there's been a misunderstanding.

933
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:00,801
Some mistake.

934
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:03,962
Miss Bart...

935
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:05,726
remains here.

936
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:15,080
And I think, George, we'd better
not detain our guests any longer.

937
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:20,997
I have some business to attend
to...

938
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,965
and it's easier for me to remain
ashore forthe night.

939
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,922
Mr Selden, you promised to see me
to my cab.

940
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,159
Do you know of a quiet hotel?

941
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:37,363
To go to alone? lmpossible.

942
01:15:37,527 --> 01:15:39,836
Well, it's too wet to sleep
outside.

943
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:43,198
There must be someone you can go
to.

944
01:15:43,367 --> 01:15:44,197
At this hour?

945
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:46,244
God, ifyou'd only listened to me.

946
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:47,044
Not now.

947
01:15:47,287 --> 01:15:49,278
You must go immediately to the
Stepneys.

948
01:15:49,447 --> 01:15:52,519
I can't. You mustn't ask me to.
You don't know Gwen.

949
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:54,723
Come, you must appear to have gone
there directly.

950
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:55,797
What if she refuses?

951
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:57,559
Shewon't. Trust me.

952
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:06,004
I, Julia Grace Peniston...

953
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:09,125
being of sound
mind and body...

954
01:16:09,287 --> 01:16:11,676
declare this to be my last
will and testament...

955
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:14,884
hereby revoking and declaring
utterly void...

956
01:16:15,047 --> 01:16:18,801
all wills and clauses of wills
here to fore made by me.

957
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:23,516
It is my will and desire that,
after my death...

958
01:16:23,727 --> 01:16:27,242
all my just debts shall be
paid by my executive...

959
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,762
here in after named.

960
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:34,918
Second, it is my will and
desire...

961
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:38,278
Lily will get everything, of
course.

962
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:40,996
Aunt Julia was always
a just woman.

963
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:44,523
Well, it's only about four hundred
thousand.

964
01:16:44,807 --> 01:16:48,516
Eight. And to my niece,
Miss Lily Bart...

965
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:52,118
l bequeath the sum of ten thousand
dollars.

966
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:58,396
Nine. And the residue
of my estate...

967
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,603
l bequeath to my dear niece...

968
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:03,443
Grace Julia Stepney.

969
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:05,879
Given under my hand and seal...

970
01:17:06,087 --> 01:17:08,726
22nd May 1906.

971
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:24,326
My dear Grace.

972
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:26,886
I am so glad.

973
01:17:49,967 --> 01:17:51,878
What sweet shall we have today?

974
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:52,877
Lily!

975
01:17:53,287 --> 01:17:54,515
My dear Carry,...

976
01:17:54,687 --> 01:17:57,121
you wouldn't let the head waiter
see I've nothing to live on...

977
01:17:57,287 --> 01:17:58,879
but my Aunt Julia's legacy?

978
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,044
Think of Bertha Dorset's
satisfaction...

979
01:18:01,247 --> 01:18:04,557
if she came and found us lunching
on cold mutton and tea.

980
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:07,520
I was horrid to you in Monte
Carlo, Lily.

981
01:18:07,687 --> 01:18:09,040
I'm ashamed of myself...

982
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:12,279
and I've wanted to tell you so
ever since, and that's the truth.

983
01:18:12,767 --> 01:18:14,086
Well, what is truth?

984
01:18:14,887 --> 01:18:18,436
Where a woman is concerned it's a
story that's easiest to believe.

985
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:22,159
If I'd have got the money,
no-one would dare ignore me.

986
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:25,285
And if they did, it wouldn't
matter. I'd be independent.

987
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:26,757
Lily.

988
01:18:27,247 --> 01:18:28,396
It's so unjust.

989
01:18:28,567 --> 01:18:31,718
Grace Stepney must feel she has no
right to that inheritance.

990
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:36,040
Anyone who knew how to please Aunt
Julia has a right to her money.

991
01:18:36,207 --> 01:18:37,481
But she was devoted to you.

992
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,441
Be honest, Carry.

993
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:41,484
She disapproved of my going with
the Dorsets...

994
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:44,286
and she heard of my break
with them.

995
01:18:44,447 --> 01:18:47,166
After all, Bertha did
turn me off the yacht.

996
01:18:49,127 --> 01:18:51,846
I must know where I stand,
Carry.

997
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:55,083
And know what's being said of me.

998
01:18:57,207 --> 01:18:58,356
I don't listen.

999
01:18:58,607 --> 01:19:01,280
One hears such things without
listening.

1000
01:19:01,527 --> 01:19:02,880
Good afternoon, Mrs Fisher.

1001
01:19:03,047 --> 01:19:05,003
Carry, how delightful to see you.

1002
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:06,481
How delightful, Judy.

1003
01:19:07,127 --> 01:19:08,606
Oh, Lily.

1004
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,680
What a pleasure to see you.

1005
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:13,443
Gus!

1006
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:14,876
Miss Bart.

1007
01:19:15,527 --> 01:19:17,404
I must see the head waiter, Judy.

1008
01:19:28,287 --> 01:19:31,040
Where Judy leads, the world will
follow.

1009
01:19:32,007 --> 01:19:33,725
Not your real friends.

1010
01:19:35,807 --> 01:19:38,275
Meanwhile, what do you say to
putting a few things in a trunk...

1011
01:19:38,447 --> 01:19:41,484
and spending the summer with
me and the Gormers?

1012
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:46,766
To take me out of my ''friends'''
way you mean?

1013
01:19:46,967 --> 01:19:49,879
Till they realise how much they
miss you.

1014
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:53,518
Besides, the Gormers have taken
a tremendous fancy to you.

1015
01:19:53,887 --> 01:19:57,926
I know they're not yourset, kind
of a social Coney Island.

1016
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,280
But anyone's welcome who can make
noise and doesn't put on airs.

1017
01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:04,518
Yes.

1018
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:06,483
I shall come.

1019
01:20:08,087 --> 01:20:10,203
Well, what shall it be?

1020
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:13,042
Coup Jacques
orPechesa la Melba?

1021
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:34,963
The more I think of my getting
you here, the better I like it.

1022
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:38,443
More noise, more colour,
more slapdash sociability.

1023
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:41,326
But greater good nature too.

1024
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:42,522
Less rivalry.

1025
01:20:42,767 --> 01:20:44,120
Yes, it's true.

1026
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:49,762
Soon everybody will be leaving...

1027
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:53,281
for Newport and Bar Harbour
and Long Island.

1028
01:20:55,327 --> 01:20:57,921
And me to a hotel in
broiling NewYork.

1029
01:21:01,327 --> 01:21:02,077
Lily...

1030
01:21:03,887 --> 01:21:05,240
you must marry.

1031
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:06,806
As soon as you can.

1032
01:21:08,567 --> 01:21:11,206
Do you mean to recommend me
to 'a good man's love'?

1033
01:21:11,447 --> 01:21:14,837
Neitherof my candidates answers
to that description.

1034
01:21:15,007 --> 01:21:15,723
Neither?

1035
01:21:15,887 --> 01:21:17,161
There are actually two?

1036
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,879
Perhaps one-and-a-half.

1037
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:23,916
All things being equal, I think
I'd prefer half a husband.

1038
01:21:25,087 --> 01:21:26,076
Who is he?

1039
01:21:27,127 --> 01:21:28,640
George Dorset.

1040
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:31,156
Don't fly out at me till
you hear my reasons.

1041
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:34,319
Since they got back from Europe
things have been going very badly.

1042
01:21:34,487 --> 01:21:37,240
Bertha's behaviour has strained
even George's credulity.

1043
01:21:37,487 --> 01:21:40,126
They're over at their place now
but the end will come soon.

1044
01:21:40,287 --> 01:21:41,561
The end will nevercome.

1045
01:21:42,247 --> 01:21:45,284
Bertha will always get him back
exactly when shewants him.

1046
01:21:45,887 --> 01:21:47,002
Oh, Lily.

1047
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:49,956
He wouldn't stay with her ten
minutes if he knew.

1048
01:21:51,487 --> 01:21:52,317
"Knew"?

1049
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:54,842
If he had positive proof, I mean.

1050
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:57,922
Please, let's drop the subject.

1051
01:21:58,127 --> 01:21:59,321
It's too odious to me.

1052
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:03,199
And the second candidate?

1053
01:22:03,367 --> 01:22:04,800
We mustn't forget him.

1054
01:22:06,007 --> 01:22:07,725
Sim Rosedale.

1055
01:22:11,967 --> 01:22:14,765
l think I'd like to go fora walk.

1056
01:22:36,847 --> 01:22:37,882
Miss Bart.

1057
01:22:40,727 --> 01:22:42,160
I've been hoping to meet you.

1058
01:22:42,967 --> 01:22:44,685
I'd have written if I'd dared.

1059
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:49,484
I wanted to apologise.

1060
01:22:49,807 --> 01:22:51,286
Don't let us speak of it.

1061
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:54,758
I was very sorry for you.

1062
01:22:56,207 --> 01:22:57,799
You must let me explain.

1063
01:22:58,447 --> 01:22:59,641
I was deceived.

1064
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:02,683
I am more sorry for you then.

1065
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:06,278
But you must see that
I am not exactly...

1066
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:08,597
the person with whom this subject
can be discussed.

1067
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:10,163
Why not?

1068
01:23:10,327 --> 01:23:13,046
It's you of all people I owe
an explanation to.

1069
01:23:13,247 --> 01:23:15,044
No explanation is necessary.

1070
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:18,157
The situation was perfectly
clear to me.

1071
01:23:18,647 --> 01:23:20,603
Miss Bart, don't turn away.

1072
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:27,355
You must understand...

1073
01:23:27,527 --> 01:23:30,917
that afterwhat happened, we
cannot be friends again.

1074
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,759
Wasn't I punished enough?

1075
01:23:36,727 --> 01:23:38,319
Is there to be no respite?

1076
01:23:38,567 --> 01:23:40,842
I'd have thought you had complete
respite...

1077
01:23:41,007 --> 01:23:43,840
in the reconciliation that was
effected at my expense.

1078
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:45,959
Don't put it that way.

1079
01:23:46,207 --> 01:23:48,641
All I ask you to understand is
that...

1080
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:54,043
after the use that Bertha made of
me...

1081
01:23:55,727 --> 01:23:59,640
after all that her behaviour has
since implied...

1082
01:24:00,447 --> 01:24:03,166
it is impossible that you and l
should meet.

1083
01:24:04,767 --> 01:24:05,722
Please help me.

1084
01:24:09,487 --> 01:24:10,442
I am sorry.

1085
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:13,799
There is nothing I can do.

1086
01:24:17,007 --> 01:24:18,725
You must have other friends...

1087
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,445
otheradvisors.

1088
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:22,918
l never had a friend like you.

1089
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,563
Besides, you're the only one who
knows.

1090
01:24:29,127 --> 01:24:31,357
You were there in Monte Carlo.

1091
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:35,846
You are mistaken.

1092
01:24:37,527 --> 01:24:38,755
I saw nothing.

1093
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,521
l know nothing.

1094
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:46,526
Just saywhat you know and the
way will be clearfor us both.

1095
01:24:47,687 --> 01:24:48,836
l know nothing.

1096
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:55,563
You are sacrificing both of us.

1097
01:24:58,047 --> 01:24:59,116
l know nothing.

1098
01:25:01,767 --> 01:25:03,120
Absolutely nothing.

1099
01:25:09,647 --> 01:25:10,921
Who's gonna catch you?

1100
01:25:16,727 --> 01:25:17,682
Come along.

1101
01:25:18,607 --> 01:25:20,165
You ought to be in bed.

1102
01:25:21,007 --> 01:25:21,996
Yes, mother.

1103
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:27,885
Goodnight, Miss Bart.

1104
01:25:28,047 --> 01:25:29,275
Goodnight, Edith.

1105
01:25:31,567 --> 01:25:32,363
Go on.

1106
01:25:37,647 --> 01:25:38,682
Where are the others?

1107
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:44,197
I'm your only fellow guest.

1108
01:25:49,207 --> 01:25:51,641
Carry was trying to be subtle.

1109
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:55,801
You look tired,

1110
01:25:56,207 --> 01:25:57,526
I've been sleeping badly.

1111
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:05,040
In fact, I came especially
to see you.

1112
01:26:05,407 --> 01:26:06,920
On a delicate matter.

1113
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:09,845
I hope you can believe that.

1114
01:26:11,487 --> 01:26:14,047
Thank you, I believe what you say.

1115
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:17,566
lIyou wish.

1116
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:20,601
But, Miss Lily...

1117
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:22,837
I suppose that is what you wish.

1118
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:25,925
And though I was unable to consent
when last you spoke to me...

1119
01:26:26,087 --> 01:26:28,965
I am ready, now that I know you
much better...

1120
01:26:29,207 --> 01:26:31,163
to put my happiness in your hands.

1121
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:34,959
My dear Miss Lily...

1122
01:26:35,127 --> 01:26:38,039
you made me feel that my suit was
so hopeless that...

1123
01:26:38,207 --> 01:26:40,357
I had no intention of renewing it.

1124
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:52,001
I can only blame myself...

1125
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:55,159
if I gave you the impression
that my decision was final.

1126
01:27:04,047 --> 01:27:05,560
Before we say goodbye...

1127
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,476
I want at least to thank you for
once having thought of me.

1128
01:27:10,247 --> 01:27:12,363
Why do you talk of saying goodbye?

1129
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:16,315
Can't we still be good friends
all the same?

1130
01:27:20,207 --> 01:27:22,721
What is your idea of being
"good friends"?

1131
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:27,881
Seeing me without asking me
to marry you?

1132
01:27:29,647 --> 01:27:31,239
That's about the size of it.

1133
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:35,600
I like your frankness...

1134
01:27:36,807 --> 01:27:38,320
I'm afraid that our friendship...

1135
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:41,081
can hardly continue
on those terms.

1136
01:27:41,247 --> 01:27:42,475
Miss Lily, what I mean...

1137
01:27:42,647 --> 01:27:45,366
What you mean to say is that
I'm not as desirable a match...

1138
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:47,119
as once you thought me.

1139
01:27:48,247 --> 01:27:49,726
Yes, that is what I do mean.

1140
01:27:50,727 --> 01:27:52,718
I don't believe the stories about
you...

1141
01:27:52,887 --> 01:27:55,082
but my not believing them
won't alter the situation.

1142
01:27:55,247 --> 01:27:57,807
If they are not true, doesn't that
alter the situation?

1143
01:27:57,967 --> 01:28:01,926
You know as well as I do, last
year you wouldn't look at me.

1144
01:28:02,087 --> 01:28:03,725
Now you appear willing to do so.

1145
01:28:04,367 --> 01:28:06,198
What's changed in the interval?

1146
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:08,840
Your situation.

1147
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:12,598
You thought you could do better.

1148
01:28:14,847 --> 01:28:16,280
You think you can?

1149
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:17,836
Yes, I do.

1150
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:19,680
I've done verywell.

1151
01:28:20,047 --> 01:28:22,038
I've placed Wall Street under
obligations...

1152
01:28:22,207 --> 01:28:24,118
that only 5th Avenue can repay.

1153
01:28:24,327 --> 01:28:27,763
But the quickest way to queer
oneself with the right people...

1154
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:29,838
is to be seen with the wrong ones.

1155
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:32,358
I want to avoid mistakes.

1156
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,316
I understand.

1157
01:28:41,847 --> 01:28:43,565
Goodbye, Mr Rosedale.

1158
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,164
Why don't you use her letters?

1159
01:28:51,127 --> 01:28:53,687
Don't ask me how I know you
bought them.

1160
01:28:53,847 --> 01:28:54,916
I know.

1161
01:28:55,927 --> 01:28:59,920
I don't suppose you bought them
just to collect autographs.

1162
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:03,123
You see, I know where you stand.

1163
01:29:03,647 --> 01:29:05,877
You have Bertha completely
in your power.

1164
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:08,603
You wish to be rehabilitated
socially...

1165
01:29:08,967 --> 01:29:11,117
and you have the means of your
redemption.

1166
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:16,760
In a deal like this, nobody comes
out with perfectly clean hands.

1167
01:29:18,407 --> 01:29:22,161
If you're going to fight Bertha,
don't inflict an open injury.

1168
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:25,722
Reduce it to a private
transaction.

1169
01:29:27,967 --> 01:29:29,320
'Give and take' you mean?

1170
01:29:29,887 --> 01:29:30,763
Yes.

1171
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:32,442
As in business.

1172
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:33,722
Or politics.

1173
01:29:33,927 --> 01:29:35,360
You see how simple it is?

1174
01:29:36,127 --> 01:29:39,039
There's no point frightening
Bertha into line.

1175
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:41,199
You have to keep her there.

1176
01:29:43,567 --> 01:29:45,285
That's my part of the business.

1177
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:48,359
That's what I'm offering you.

1178
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:52,362
To reconcile with Bertha and then
you'll marry me?

1179
01:29:52,727 --> 01:29:54,319
What do you say, Miss Lily?

1180
01:29:54,967 --> 01:29:58,755
You are mistaken in both the facts
and what you infer from them.

1181
01:30:00,487 --> 01:30:02,239
Well, I'll be damned!

1182
01:30:03,727 --> 01:30:05,718
I suppose it's because the
letters are to him?

1183
01:30:08,887 --> 01:30:11,003
I thought we understood each
other.

1184
01:30:11,767 --> 01:30:13,120
We do now.

1185
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:27,396
Come in.

1186
01:30:42,847 --> 01:30:46,044
It's such a blessing to have a
quiet few weeks here.

1187
01:30:48,687 --> 01:30:50,917
Thank you for inviting me here.

1188
01:30:51,687 --> 01:30:53,439
I do love it in Tuxedo.

1189
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:54,318
Yes.

1190
01:30:54,647 --> 01:30:56,160
It's a pleasant house.

1191
01:30:57,007 --> 01:30:59,521
One of my few treasured
possessions.

1192
01:31:05,247 --> 01:31:06,646
How are the Brys?

1193
01:31:08,687 --> 01:31:11,121
Louisa Bry is a stern taskmaster.

1194
01:31:12,887 --> 01:31:14,957
Talk about love making
peoplejealous.

1195
01:31:15,127 --> 01:31:16,924
It's nothing to social ambition.

1196
01:31:19,687 --> 01:31:22,759
I had a visit from Mattie Gormer
the other day.

1197
01:31:23,807 --> 01:31:26,162
She was with Bertha Dorset
of all people.

1198
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:33,560
No doubt the rabbit always thinks
it's fascinating the anaconda.

1199
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:38,598
Now they're fast friends...

1200
01:31:38,767 --> 01:31:41,156
I think Mattie will sacrifice
anything for her.

1201
01:31:43,687 --> 01:31:45,006
Including me?

1202
01:31:50,327 --> 01:31:51,521
My dear...

1203
01:31:53,687 --> 01:31:55,598
the world is vile.

1204
01:32:12,447 --> 01:32:13,243
Lily.

1205
01:32:13,967 --> 01:32:15,685
Mrs Hatch, I'm not dressed!

1206
01:32:15,847 --> 01:32:17,246
It doesn't matter.

1207
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:20,160
This is the 20th Century,
not the Dark Ages.

1208
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,761
As soon as you've eaten,
come to my rooms.

1209
01:32:22,967 --> 01:32:25,162
I'm leaving in twenty minutes,
so please be quick.

1210
01:32:26,727 --> 01:32:28,524
I cannot find my prescription.

1211
01:32:28,687 --> 01:32:29,642
Do you have it?

1212
01:32:29,807 --> 01:32:30,922
I'm always losing them.

1213
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:33,078
You usually leave them on your
bureau, Mrs Hatch.

1214
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:34,316
Of course I do.

1215
01:32:34,487 --> 01:32:36,284
Get it filled for me today.

1216
01:32:36,447 --> 01:32:38,324
Without my chloral I never sleep.

1217
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:40,717
I have to see my beauty doctor
or I cannot face society.

1218
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:43,557
The manicure will have to wait
till tomorrow.

1219
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:45,758
Not up to it today, put heroff.

1220
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:49,124
Don't look sour, Lily,
she won't mind.

1221
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:50,356
She never minds.

1222
01:32:50,527 --> 01:32:52,199
After lunch I shall go to
Sherry's for tea...

1223
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:54,722
then this evening I'm playing
bridge with my lawyer.

1224
01:32:54,887 --> 01:32:56,559
I'll try to go for a fitting
tomorrow morning...

1225
01:32:56,727 --> 01:32:59,287
but only if it doesn't interfere
with the art exhibition at four.

1226
01:32:59,447 --> 01:32:59,765
Then supperat...

1227
01:32:59,927 --> 01:33:01,758
No, theatre first, then supper.

1228
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:04,999
If you don't tell me in advance
of these changes, How can I...

1229
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:06,600
keep your diary accurately?

1230
01:33:06,767 --> 01:33:09,918
Engagements are made to be broken.
Especially with tradespeople.

1231
01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:11,406
They expect it.

1232
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:12,761
Yes, Mrs Hatch.

1233
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:15,122
By the way, Lily...

1234
01:33:15,287 --> 01:33:18,996
on Friday I'm dining with Melville
Stancy and the Gormers.

1235
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:21,397
Yes, Mrs Hatch.

1236
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:23,285
Don't forget my prescription.

1237
01:33:23,447 --> 01:33:24,960
It's on the bureau.

1238
01:33:30,927 --> 01:33:33,999
Mrs Fisher was anxious to know
how you were getting on.

1239
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:37,362
Why didn't she look me up
herself then?

1240
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:39,925
Afraid of being importunate.

1241
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,967
You see, no such scruples
restrained me.

1242
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:48,165
Then you've come to be
of some use to me?

1243
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:49,437
Yes.

1244
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:51,886
So what am I to do with you?

1245
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,561
Talk things overwith me.

1246
01:33:57,527 --> 01:34:00,963
What makes you think that I have
anything to talk about?

1247
01:34:02,047 --> 01:34:05,562
My initiative doesn't go beyond
putting myself at your disposal.

1248
01:34:06,927 --> 01:34:09,725
I shouldn't have come if I'd
thought I'd be of no use to you.

1249
01:34:14,207 --> 01:34:15,799
Do you know where you are?

1250
01:34:16,007 --> 01:34:17,759
Of course I know where I am!

1251
01:34:18,687 --> 01:34:20,678
You must let me take you away from
here.

1252
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:23,760
If you've come to say disagreeable
things about Mrs Hatch...

1253
01:34:23,927 --> 01:34:26,316
It is precisely your relationship
with her that concerns me.

1254
01:34:26,487 --> 01:34:28,079
My relationshipwith Mrs Hatch...

1255
01:34:28,247 --> 01:34:30,636
is one that I've no reason to be
ashamed of!

1256
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:32,001
She's helped me earn a living...

1257
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:34,806
when my old friends were quite
content to see me starve!

1258
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:35,877
Nonsense!

1259
01:34:36,047 --> 01:34:37,958
Starvation is not the only
alternative.

1260
01:34:38,127 --> 01:34:40,960
Your aunt's legacy could make you
moderately independent.

1261
01:34:41,287 --> 01:34:43,084
Well, what you don't know...

1262
01:34:43,247 --> 01:34:46,557
is that I owe every penny
of that legacy!

1263
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:49,362
Good God!

1264
01:34:49,567 --> 01:34:50,841
Every penny...

1265
01:34:51,047 --> 01:34:52,241
and more besides.

1266
01:34:53,127 --> 01:34:55,357
I have no money except my small
income...

1267
01:34:55,527 --> 01:34:58,803
and I need to earn money to keep
myself alive!

1268
01:35:02,727 --> 01:35:06,436
I should be happier to see you out
of this particular 'employment'.

1269
01:35:06,687 --> 01:35:08,166
But I should not.

1270
01:35:10,887 --> 01:35:12,878
ljust want to point out to you...

1271
01:35:13,047 --> 01:35:15,197
the false position you have placed
yourself in.

1272
01:35:15,367 --> 01:35:19,326
I suppose by that you mean my
being on the outside of society?

1273
01:35:19,487 --> 01:35:21,603
But I have long been excluded
from it...

1274
01:35:21,767 --> 01:35:24,565
and I remember you once telling me
that it was only those on...

1275
01:35:24,727 --> 01:35:26,877
the inside who took the difference
seriously!

1276
01:35:27,047 --> 01:35:30,164
Mrs Hatch's desire to be inside...

1277
01:35:30,327 --> 01:35:32,158
may put you in a false position.

1278
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:33,362
You cannot want this!

1279
01:35:33,967 --> 01:35:37,755
You have already told me that the
sole object of my upbringing...

1280
01:35:37,967 --> 01:35:40,720
was to teach me to getwhat
I want.

1281
01:35:41,127 --> 01:35:44,722
Why not assume that that's
precisely what I am doing now?

1282
01:35:46,127 --> 01:35:50,166
You're not a successful example...

1283
01:35:51,327 --> 01:35:53,522
of that kind of upbringing.
Give me a little more time.

1284
01:35:53,807 --> 01:35:55,957
I may still do credit to my
training!

1285
01:35:59,367 --> 01:36:01,005
That was undignified.

1286
01:36:01,767 --> 01:36:05,442
Where does dignity end and
rectitude begin?

1287
01:36:09,447 --> 01:36:10,846
Good day, Miss Bart.

1288
01:36:11,367 --> 01:36:13,358
Good day, Mr Selden.

1289
01:38:38,447 --> 01:38:41,644
She got five dollars and her
picture in the paper.

1290
01:38:41,807 --> 01:38:42,603
The hat?

1291
01:38:42,767 --> 01:38:44,200
No, she got that yesterday.

1292
01:38:44,407 --> 01:38:46,398
No, the one with the green
paradise.

1293
01:38:47,647 --> 01:38:50,719
Madame asked me to alter that
Virot hat.

1294
01:38:51,487 --> 01:38:55,275
She's tall, slight,
but her hair's all frizzed out.

1295
01:38:55,607 --> 01:38:57,086
A lot like Mary Leach.

1296
01:38:58,647 --> 01:38:59,966
Only thinner.

1297
01:39:09,327 --> 01:39:10,442
Miss Bart.

1298
01:39:11,687 --> 01:39:14,884
Look at these spangles.
Every one sewed on crooked.

1299
01:39:15,527 --> 01:39:16,403
I'm sorry.

1300
01:39:17,847 --> 01:39:19,280
I'm afraid I'm not well.

1301
01:39:19,567 --> 01:39:22,604
If you can't do better, I'll
give the hat to Miss Kilroy.

1302
01:39:22,887 --> 01:39:24,559
Go back to binding edges.

1303
01:39:44,127 --> 01:39:45,116
Miss Bart.

1304
01:39:55,887 --> 01:39:58,082
Miss Bart, I must draw your
attention...

1305
01:39:58,247 --> 01:40:00,761
to the fact that yourwork
is poor...

1306
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:02,280
and your attendance irregular.

1307
01:40:03,487 --> 01:40:05,318
Miss Haines is right.

1308
01:40:06,127 --> 01:40:08,277
I am clumsy and slow to learn.

1309
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:11,835
I have been indisposed lately.

1310
01:40:12,567 --> 01:40:14,364
But I'll try to improve.

1311
01:40:14,567 --> 01:40:15,920
It's too late for that.

1312
01:40:16,087 --> 01:40:18,157
I took you on as an untrained
apprentice...

1313
01:40:18,327 --> 01:40:20,602
as a favourto Mrs Fisher...

1314
01:40:20,767 --> 01:40:22,644
but against my betterjudgement.

1315
01:40:22,887 --> 01:40:27,085
I'm afraid that I will have to
dispense with your services.

1316
01:40:30,167 --> 01:40:33,079
I trust you'll find a position
more suited to your skills.

1317
01:40:34,287 --> 01:40:35,242
Thank you.

1318
01:41:04,567 --> 01:41:05,795
How are you, Grace?

1319
01:41:14,567 --> 01:41:16,922
Her memory is everywhere.

1320
01:41:21,207 --> 01:41:22,640
The whole house.

1321
01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:31,840
And you, Lily...

1322
01:41:33,207 --> 01:41:34,481
how are you?

1323
01:41:36,727 --> 01:41:38,843
You look dreadfully tired.

1324
01:41:45,247 --> 01:41:46,760
I don't sleep at night.

1325
01:41:50,007 --> 01:41:51,440
Since when?

1326
01:41:52,927 --> 01:41:54,155
I don't...

1327
01:41:57,607 --> 01:41:59,006
I can't remember.

1328
01:42:03,247 --> 01:42:05,158
There are otherworries.

1329
01:42:07,767 --> 01:42:09,166
Dreadful things.

1330
01:42:11,407 --> 01:42:12,635
What things?

1331
01:42:15,487 --> 01:42:16,681
Poverty.

1332
01:42:19,807 --> 01:42:22,002
I can't think ofanything worse.

1333
01:42:31,487 --> 01:42:33,876
I can't go on this way.

1334
01:42:37,647 --> 01:42:40,286
Do you have any idea when the
legacies will be paid?

1335
01:42:43,167 --> 01:42:44,122
No, Lily.

1336
01:42:47,487 --> 01:42:49,682
No-one has received them yet.

1337
01:42:51,967 --> 01:42:53,320
Not even me.

1338
01:42:55,407 --> 01:42:58,080
The truth is, I need the money.

1339
01:43:02,887 --> 01:43:06,436
Would you be willing to lend me
the amount of my legacy?

1340
01:43:10,007 --> 01:43:11,963
You must be patient.

1341
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:19,886
Remember how beautifully patient
Aunt Julia always was.

1342
01:43:20,407 --> 01:43:22,602
But you'll get everything, Grace.

1343
01:43:22,887 --> 01:43:25,321
It would be easy foryou to borrow
ten times the amount...

1344
01:43:25,487 --> 01:43:27,000
that I'm asking for.

1345
01:43:29,487 --> 01:43:30,363
Borrow?

1346
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:34,601
I am at the end of my tether.

1347
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:44,635
You imagine fora moment that I'd
raise money...

1348
01:43:44,807 --> 01:43:48,163
on my expectations from
Aunt Julia?

1349
01:43:52,447 --> 01:43:54,358
If you must know the truth...

1350
01:43:54,527 --> 01:43:56,518
it was your being in debt...

1351
01:43:56,687 --> 01:43:58,359
that brought on her last illness.

1352
01:44:01,967 --> 01:44:03,639
You won't help me then?

1353
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,441
If there's anything I can do...

1354
01:44:13,607 --> 01:44:16,167
to make you realise the folly of
your course and ...

1355
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:24,081
how much she disapproved of it...

1356
01:44:31,447 --> 01:44:35,360
I shall feel it is the truest way
of making up to you for her loss.

1357
01:44:57,727 --> 01:44:59,046
Thank you, Grace.

1358
01:45:00,807 --> 01:45:02,843
It was good of you to see me.

1359
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:07,156
Goodbye.

1360
01:45:38,367 --> 01:45:39,436
Can I help?

1361
01:45:43,647 --> 01:45:44,875
Mrs Hatch?

1362
01:45:45,647 --> 01:45:46,443
Yes.

1363
01:45:56,607 --> 01:45:58,916
You mustn't increase the dose,
Mrs Hatch.

1364
01:45:59,087 --> 01:46:00,042
Of course not.

1365
01:46:17,727 --> 01:46:18,796
Miss Lily?

1366
01:46:24,567 --> 01:46:25,795
What's the matter?

1367
01:46:26,927 --> 01:46:28,883
I'm a little tired.

1368
01:46:29,327 --> 01:46:30,362
It's nothing.

1369
01:46:38,127 --> 01:46:39,924
Stay with me a moment, please.

1370
01:46:42,567 --> 01:46:43,841
We can't stay here.

1371
01:46:44,007 --> 01:46:46,567
Let's go to The Longworth
for some tea.

1372
01:46:51,767 --> 01:46:53,485
Take your tea strong.

1373
01:46:56,487 --> 01:46:58,478
I haven't seen you in ages...

1374
01:47:01,567 --> 01:47:03,478
I wondered what had become of you.

1375
01:47:04,887 --> 01:47:06,923
I have joined the working classes.

1376
01:47:08,607 --> 01:47:10,837
I was trying to learn to become a
milliner.

1377
01:47:11,007 --> 01:47:12,599
You can't be serious.

1378
01:47:13,087 --> 01:47:14,520
Perfectly serious.

1379
01:47:19,287 --> 01:47:21,926
I understood that you were with
Mrs Hatch.

1380
01:47:23,487 --> 01:47:25,443
She dismissed me two months ago.

1381
01:47:27,007 --> 01:47:29,805
After she had got into society...

1382
01:47:29,967 --> 01:47:32,527
it seems my reputation had become
a social liability.

1383
01:47:34,927 --> 01:47:38,283
Since then I have been obliged to
work for my living.

1384
01:47:41,527 --> 01:47:43,245
That wasn't for you anyhow.

1385
01:47:44,727 --> 01:47:45,762
I must go.

1386
01:47:45,927 --> 01:47:47,724
No, no, rest a little longer.

1387
01:47:49,727 --> 01:47:53,003
What did you mean about learning
to become a milliner?

1388
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:54,486
Just what I said.

1389
01:47:55,287 --> 01:47:57,562
I am an apprentice at Madame
Regina's.

1390
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:02,721
I was an apprentice at Madame
Regina's.

1391
01:48:05,447 --> 01:48:08,280
I understood you received a legacy
from your aunt.

1392
01:48:08,967 --> 01:48:10,400
Ten thousand dollars.

1393
01:48:11,847 --> 01:48:15,442
But it isn't paid until spring and
anyway, I owe it already.

1394
01:48:16,087 --> 01:48:17,315
Thewhole ten thousand?

1395
01:48:17,807 --> 01:48:19,320
Every penny.

1396
01:48:24,727 --> 01:48:27,639
I think Gus Trenorspoke to you
once...

1397
01:48:27,807 --> 01:48:30,605
about having made me some money in
stocks.

1398
01:48:31,287 --> 01:48:33,403
He made me nine thousand dollars.

1399
01:48:35,007 --> 01:48:37,567
I knew nothing about business.

1400
01:48:38,087 --> 01:48:41,636
I thought he had invested my
own money.

1401
01:48:44,487 --> 01:48:47,479
In fact what he had made
he had given me.

1402
01:48:48,607 --> 01:48:50,279
It was meant in kindness...

1403
01:48:50,927 --> 01:48:54,397
but it wasn't the sort of
obligation I could remain under.

1404
01:48:55,447 --> 01:48:57,438
I was incredibly stupid.

1405
01:48:58,407 --> 01:49:01,797
I spent the money before
I realised.

1406
01:49:03,727 --> 01:49:07,083
And so my aunt's legacy must
go to pay it back.

1407
01:49:08,607 --> 01:49:09,881
That is why...

1408
01:49:11,647 --> 01:49:13,558
That is why I must now work.

1409
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:16,283
That'll clean you out altogether.

1410
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:19,836
Altogether.

1411
01:49:21,687 --> 01:49:22,517
Yes.

1412
01:49:24,967 --> 01:49:26,923
Miss Lily, ifyou want my
backing...

1413
01:49:27,087 --> 01:49:27,963
Thank you.

1414
01:49:29,887 --> 01:49:32,401
Yourtea has been a great backing.

1415
01:49:33,607 --> 01:49:35,962
I feel equal to anything now.

1416
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:54,964
Surely this isn't the place?

1417
01:49:55,847 --> 01:49:56,836
Yes.

1418
01:49:57,327 --> 01:49:58,680
I room and board here.

1419
01:50:00,287 --> 01:50:02,755
I have lived too long
on my friends.

1420
01:50:18,807 --> 01:50:20,763
You can't go on living here.

1421
01:50:22,007 --> 01:50:24,726
I have gone over my expenses
very carefully...

1422
01:50:25,047 --> 01:50:27,038
and I think I can manage it.

1423
01:50:27,207 --> 01:50:28,640
That's notwhat I mean.

1424
01:50:30,807 --> 01:50:32,479
It is what I mean.

1425
01:50:35,967 --> 01:50:38,003
I shall be out ofwork now.

1426
01:50:41,447 --> 01:50:43,165
What a way for you to talk.

1427
01:50:45,327 --> 01:50:47,045
You in a place like this.

1428
01:50:52,927 --> 01:50:55,202
My situation is nothing
exceptional.

1429
01:50:55,407 --> 01:50:56,806
But you are.

1430
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:02,479
It's an outrage.

1431
01:51:06,847 --> 01:51:09,407
Look, it's none of my business...

1432
01:51:10,567 --> 01:51:12,683
but you must accept help from
somebody.

1433
01:51:15,007 --> 01:51:17,396
You spoke to me ofyourdebt
to Gus Trenor...

1434
01:51:18,647 --> 01:51:21,480
I'll lend you the money
to pay him.

1435
01:51:21,647 --> 01:51:22,557
Let me finish.

1436
01:51:22,727 --> 01:51:24,957
It'll be purely a business
arrangement.

1437
01:51:25,567 --> 01:51:27,398
What can you have against that?

1438
01:51:28,447 --> 01:51:29,675
Only this...

1439
01:51:30,687 --> 01:51:33,565
that is exactly what Gus Trenor
proposed.

1440
01:51:34,047 --> 01:51:37,278
Once the debt is paid I shall have
no security.

1441
01:51:37,567 --> 01:51:39,319
I have been compromised once...

1442
01:51:39,487 --> 01:51:41,205
I cannot be so again.

1443
01:51:51,567 --> 01:51:53,683
I am very grateful foryour
kindness...

1444
01:51:55,247 --> 01:51:57,203
but it is impossible.

1445
01:51:58,167 --> 01:51:59,486
You must see that.

1446
01:52:07,607 --> 01:52:10,121
We must think of your future.

1447
01:52:12,127 --> 01:52:14,960
If you only knew what little
difference that makes now.

1448
01:52:19,607 --> 01:52:22,075
At least let me tell Selden
where you're living.

1449
01:52:23,087 --> 01:52:24,236
It will do no good.

1450
01:52:24,407 --> 01:52:25,283
Please.

1451
01:52:29,447 --> 01:52:30,516
Very well.

1452
01:52:32,007 --> 01:52:34,202
You may tell him if you wish.

1453
01:52:40,367 --> 01:52:42,722
If only you'd let me help you...

1454
01:52:43,087 --> 01:52:45,601
you could wipe your feet on
them.

1455
01:54:28,207 --> 01:54:30,357
Why don't you use the letters?

1456
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:32,685
It would be so simple.

1457
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,999
It is so simple.

1458
01:55:50,967 --> 01:55:53,686
Today I'll tell you about the
plight of...

1459
01:55:53,847 --> 01:55:56,441
the poor people of Russia under
the Tsar.

1460
01:56:22,327 --> 01:56:24,716
Would you please inform
Mrs Dorset...

1461
01:56:24,887 --> 01:56:27,117
that Miss Lily Bart wishes to
speak with her.

1462
01:56:27,367 --> 01:56:29,278
Mrs Dorset is not at home, Miss
Bart.

1463
01:56:31,567 --> 01:56:33,683
Then I'd like to speak with
Mr Dorset.

1464
01:56:33,967 --> 01:56:37,880
I'm sorry, Mrand Mrs Dorset left
for the country two days ago.

1465
01:56:44,327 --> 01:56:46,079
Shall I take a message?

1466
01:56:47,127 --> 01:56:47,957
No.

1467
01:56:49,487 --> 01:56:50,602
No message.

1468
01:57:47,727 --> 01:57:49,285
I can recommend the armchair.

1469
01:58:22,047 --> 01:58:25,801
I came to say I am sorry
for the way we parted.

1470
01:58:31,207 --> 01:58:34,005
Forwhat I said to you
that day at Mrs Hatch's.

1471
01:58:34,607 --> 01:58:36,325
I was sorry too.

1472
01:58:42,327 --> 01:58:43,885
You look tired.

1473
01:58:47,407 --> 01:58:48,396
Do sit down.

1474
01:58:57,127 --> 01:58:58,196
You're drenched.

1475
01:58:58,807 --> 01:59:00,240
Let me make you some tea.

1476
01:59:00,407 --> 01:59:01,157
No.

1477
01:59:03,127 --> 01:59:04,719
I must go in a moment.

1478
01:59:08,487 --> 01:59:09,681
I must go.

1479
01:59:13,767 --> 01:59:16,201
I may not see you again
for a long time...

1480
01:59:18,127 --> 01:59:22,439
I have never forgotten the things
you said to me at Bellmont...

1481
01:59:25,047 --> 01:59:27,117
they have helped keep me...

1482
01:59:27,287 --> 01:59:29,721
from becoming the person many
people thought me to be.

1483
01:59:31,207 --> 01:59:32,276
I'm glad.

1484
01:59:33,447 --> 01:59:36,564
But nothing I said really
made the difference.

1485
01:59:36,727 --> 01:59:38,365
The difference is in yourself.

1486
01:59:38,527 --> 01:59:39,926
No, don't say that.

1487
01:59:41,367 --> 01:59:43,676
That is all that I have
lived on.

1488
01:59:45,287 --> 01:59:47,039
Don't take that from me.

1489
01:59:52,087 --> 01:59:54,885
We resist the great temptations...

1490
01:59:56,967 --> 02:00:00,721
but it is the little ones that
eventually pull us down.

1491
02:00:03,487 --> 02:00:07,400
I remember your saying that such a
life could never satisfy me...

1492
02:00:08,087 --> 02:00:10,681
and I was ashamed to admit
that it could.

1493
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,402
That's what I wanted
to thank you for.

1494
02:00:18,767 --> 02:00:20,405
I have tried.

1495
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:23,885
I have tried hard.

1496
02:00:25,687 --> 02:00:27,484
But life is difficult...

1497
02:00:28,767 --> 02:00:30,997
and I'm a useless person.

1498
02:00:33,767 --> 02:00:36,076
And now I'm on the rubbish heap.

1499
02:00:41,847 --> 02:00:42,802
Lily...

1500
02:00:45,047 --> 02:00:46,639
can I help you?

1501
02:00:48,327 --> 02:00:52,366
You told me once that you could
help me only by loving me.

1502
02:00:54,647 --> 02:00:56,763
You did love me for a moment...

1503
02:00:58,087 --> 02:00:59,406
and it helped me.

1504
02:01:01,047 --> 02:01:03,117
But that moment is gone.

1505
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:05,644
And I let it go.

1506
02:01:07,007 --> 02:01:09,885
And one must go on living.

1507
02:01:19,927 --> 02:01:22,316
Lily, you mustn't speak like this.

1508
02:01:25,607 --> 02:01:26,403
Things...

1509
02:01:26,567 --> 02:01:28,205
may change, but...

1510
02:01:31,607 --> 02:01:33,837
you'll never go out of my life.

1511
02:01:51,007 --> 02:01:52,440
Let us be friends.

1512
02:01:55,767 --> 02:01:57,598
Then I shall feel safe...

1513
02:01:59,487 --> 02:02:00,886
whatever happens.

1514
02:02:02,047 --> 02:02:03,400
What do you mean?

1515
02:02:04,287 --> 02:02:05,481
What's going to happen?

1516
02:02:05,927 --> 02:02:06,803
Nothing.

1517
02:02:08,967 --> 02:02:10,241
Nothing's going to happen.

1518
02:02:14,287 --> 02:02:16,118
But I'd like some tea now.

1519
02:02:48,807 --> 02:02:50,206
Goodbye, Lawrence.

1520
02:04:07,287 --> 02:04:09,881
The WaldorfSavingBank
West53rdstreet. New York.

1521
02:04:31,007 --> 02:04:32,645
Ten thousand dollars.

1522
02:04:37,127 --> 02:04:37,923
Ten...

1523
02:04:39,407 --> 02:04:40,760
thousand dollars.

1524
02:04:52,167 --> 02:04:55,125
CharlesAugustus Trenor

1525
02:07:09,727 --> 02:07:10,876
Oh, Lily!

1526
02:07:35,007 --> 02:07:35,757
Lily?

1527
02:07:38,847 --> 02:07:39,962
Miss Bart?

1528
02:07:41,367 --> 02:07:43,119
It's a great mercy.

1529
02:07:50,487 --> 02:07:51,636
May I...

1530
02:07:52,087 --> 02:07:53,361
may I see her...

1531
02:07:54,127 --> 02:07:55,082
alone?

1532
02:07:55,807 --> 02:07:57,445
Will it take long?

1533
02:07:58,487 --> 02:07:59,761
It won't.

1534
02:09:14,527 --> 02:09:15,482
Lily.

1535
02:09:36,247 --> 02:09:37,680
Oh, Lily.

1536
02:09:41,727 --> 02:09:42,796
I love you.
