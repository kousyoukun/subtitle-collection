1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,514
Mr Selden, what luck.

2
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,998
-Good luck?
-Yes...

3
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,276
I'm on my way to Gus Trenor's
at Bellmont...

4
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,948
and I've missed the three-fifteen
to Rhinebeck...

5
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,315
and there isn't another train
till half past five.

6
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,316
How nice that you come
to my rescue.

7
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,190
What form should my rescue take?

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,911
Oh, almost any.

9
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,193
Shall we go to Sherry's fortea?

10
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,114
I'm dying for a cup of tea, but
isn't there a quieter place?

11
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,759
I live near here.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,513
-At the Benedick still?
-Yes.

13
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,999
On the top floor.

14
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,039
Is it cool up there?

15
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,436
Come up and see.

16
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,393
I'll take the risk.

17
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,349
Oh, how delicious to have a place
like this all to oneself.

18
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,677
Even women have been known to enjoy
the privileges ofa flat.

19
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,957
Governesses, yes, but not
poor marriageable girls.

20
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,510
I even knew a girl
who once lived in a flat.

21
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,794
Oh, if I could only do over
my aunt's drawing room...

22
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,678
I should be a better woman.

23
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,599
Is it so bad?

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,991
That shows how seldom
you come there.

25
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,437
Why don't you come oftener?

26
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,109
When I do come, it's not to look
at Mrs Peniston's furniture.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,389
Nonsense.

28
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,033
You don't come at all.

29
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,869
Yet we get on so well when we meet.

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,833
Cream or lemon?

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,796
Lemon.

32
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,792
I can't make you out.

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,950
Of course there are men who
dislike me...

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,550
and others who are afraid of me.

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,398
They think I want to marry them.

36
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,995
But I don't think you dislike me.

37
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,988
And you can't possibly think I want
to marry you.

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,276
No, I absolve you from that.

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,155
Well then?

40
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,550
Well, perhaps that's the reason.

41
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,394
The reason forwhat?

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,676
The fact you don'twant to marry
me.

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,270
Perhaps I don't see that as a
strong inducement to go see you.

44
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,759
Dear Mr Selden...

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,437
it's stupid of you to be
disingenuous...

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,751
and it's not like you to be stupid.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,836
I've been about too long.

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,556
People are getting tired of me.

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,079
They're saying I ought to marry.

50
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,554
Isn't marriage yourvocation?

51
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,438
What you're all brought up for?

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,593
I suppose so.

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
So why not take the plunge and
have it over?

54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,999
You collect, do you?

55
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,516
First editions and things?

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,515
And do you collect Americana?

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,156
No, that's ratherout of my line.

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
And Americana are horribly dull,
I suppose?

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,429
I should fancy so.

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,318
Except to the historian.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,110
And yet they do fetch such fabulous
prices, don't they?

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,555
Oh, only the very rich can afford
to buy them.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,831
And you knowthat I'm not rich.

64
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,596
But life is very expensive.

65
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,317
Do you mind not being rich?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,228
And having towork...

67
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,755
do you mind that?

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,070
Oh, the work itself is not so bad.

69
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,516
I'm rather fond of the law.

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,069
But do you mind enough to have
to marry to get out of it?

71
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,309
God forbid.

72
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,040
You see, there's the difference.

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,630
A girl must, and a man if he
chooses.

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,597
Perhaps you'll meet your fate
tonight at the Trenor's.

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,517
I thought you might go there.

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,398
Those big parties bore me.

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,159
As they do me.

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,593
Then why go?

79
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,916
You forget...

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,911
it's part of the business.

81
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,992
Good luck at Bellmont.

82
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,829
Miss Bart?

83
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,033
Well, of all people.

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,270
Oh, Mr Rosedale.

85
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,555
Howare you?

86
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,199
Been up town doing some shopping?

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,031
Yes.

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,316
I came up to see my dressmaker.

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,074
I didn't know there were
any dressmakers at the Benedick.

90
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,235
That's the name of this building?

91
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,150
Yes.

92
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,548
I own it.

93
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,719
The name means
"confirmed bachelor".

94
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,949
I'm on my way to the Trenor's.

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,236
Let me take you to the station.

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,116
No.

97
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,156
Thank you.

98
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,230
You are very kind...

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,277
but I don't want to trouble you.

100
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,071
MrGryce, it's you.

101
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,238
The seat next to me is empty.

102
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,710
Do take it.

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,711
I suppose you're off to Bellmont.

104
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,996
Yes. For a week.

105
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,633
A whole week?

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,915
How delicious.

107
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,996
How are you getting on with your
Americana?

108
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,232
I've got a few new things.

109
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,229
Your uncle had a very fine
collection, I believe.

110
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,512
Yes, he collected for
a number of years, but...

111
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,676
I must have this seat, Lily...

112
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,077
Mr Gryce.

113
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,514
How do you do?

114
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,919
I came this morning from
Mount Kisco in the motor car.

115
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,230
Had to kick my heels at
Garrison's for an hour...

116
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,913
without even a cigarette.

117
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,275
I don't suppose you have
one left, have you, Lily?

118
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,351
What an absurd question, Bertha.

119
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,715
You don't smoke?

120
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,358
Sincewhen did you give it up?

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,948
You don't smoke either, Mr Gryce?

122
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,079
How stupid of me.

123
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,794
It was simply inhuman of Pragg
to go off now.

124
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,279
When I was in Tuxedo...

125
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,398
I asked a lot of people down and
I mislaid the list...

126
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,278
And I can't remember who's coming.

127
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,670
This week will be a failure too.

128
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,668
Judy, as if anybody's ever bored
at Bellmont.

129
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,795
Everything's gone wrong.

130
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,554
And now Bertha Dorset is
furious with me.

131
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,518
Furious with you? Why?

132
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,830
Because I told her Lawrence
Selden was coming, but...

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,958
hewouldn't after all and she's
unreasonable enough...

134
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,838
to believe it was my fault.

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,712
I thought thatwas all over.

136
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh, so it is. On his side.

137
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,509
I shall call him on the telephone
and tell him he simply must come.

138
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,635
Oh, don't.

139
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,394
Good gracious, Lily.
Do you dislike him so much?

140
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,152
Not at all. I like him.

141
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,229
Oh, don't say there's
any real harm in Bertha...

142
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,274
but she delights in making people
miserable, especially her husband.

143
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,233
Poor George.

144
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,916
But she is dangerous.

145
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,678
And you are not nasty.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,831
For always getting what she
wants...

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,594
commend me to a nastywoman.

148
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,190
l thought you were fond of Bertha.

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,674
Oh, I am.

150
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,350
It's much saferto be fond of
dangerous people.

151
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,078
Did you know his father made a
fortune...

152
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,068
out of inventing a device which
excludes fresh air from hotels?

153
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,116
Who?

154
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,589
Why to be sure, Lily.
Percy Gryce.

155
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,393
But he's horribly shy and
easily shocked...

156
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,318
Why don't you say it, Judy?

157
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,711
I have the reputation for being
on the hunt for a husband.

158
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,235
Lily, I asked him here
on purpose foryou.

159
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,357
Percy Gryce and I are becoming
very good friends.

160
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,633
You're sure you wouldn't like
me to telephone Lawrence Selden?

161
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,509
Quite sure.

162
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,710
I do enjoy the quiet.

163
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,073
Don't you, Lily?

164
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,230
I wish men would always stay away.

165
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,550
It's much nicerwithout them.

166
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,797
Oh, you don't count, George.

167
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,716
One never talks to one's husband.

168
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,669
But wives never like their husbands
talking to other women.

169
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,719
Only if the women in question are
slightly too eligible or divorced.

170
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,032
Wives may do as they wish.

171
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,274
Husbands are expected to be like
money, influential but silent.

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,276
If divorcees were more acceptable,
I might be tempted.

173
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,190
Gus! Oh dear.

174
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,836
You see, I came after all.

175
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,516
Thank you for keeping me from
playing bridge tonight, Mr Gryce.

176
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,159
Not at all, Miss Bart.

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,153
I have no head for the game or
the rules of betting.

178
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,276
I have been dragged into it
in the past...

179
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,670
and I have lost an appalling
amount of money.

180
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,034
Mr Gryce, I have shocked you.

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,829
Whilst I do not approve, Miss
Bart, I do approve of you.

182
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,032
I hope that means you forgive me.

183
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,958
For I am penitent.

184
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,272
Will you go to church tomorrow?

185
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,556
Yes.

186
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,276
May I accompany you, Miss Bart?

187
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,119
Of course, MrGryce.

188
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,835
Good night.

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,831
Good night, Miss Bart.

190
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,350
Dear me, am I late?

191
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,714
Late forwhat?

192
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,035
Late forwhom?

193
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,588
Perhaps you had an earlier
engagement?

194
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,554
Yes, I had.

195
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,751
Perhaps I am in theway then?

196
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,195
Mr Selden is at your disposal.

197
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,918
l never interferewith
Mr Selden's engagements.

198
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,629
But I have no engagement
with Mr Selden.

199
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,677
I was to go to church...

200
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,237
and I'm afraid that the carriages
have left without me.

201
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,312
Have they left, do you know?

202
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,439
Yes. I heard them drive away
some time ago.

203
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,437
Then I shall have towalk.

204
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,079
It's too late to get there.

205
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,153
Well, I'll have the credit for
trying at any rate.

206
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,272
You must be quite breathless.

207
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,508
How fast you walk.

208
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,272
Thought I'd never catch up.

209
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,749
But I've been sitting here
for nearly an hour!

210
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,593
Waiting for me, I hope.

211
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,951
Waiting to see ifyou'd come.

212
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,878
Weren't you sure I would?

213
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,110
If I waited long enough.

214
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,431
But I only had a limited time
to give to the experience.

215
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,669
Why ''limited''?

216
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,239
By my other engagement.

217
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,114
Now I see why you were
getting up on yourAmericana.

218
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,316
That's why I was waiting for you.

219
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,195
To thank you for giving me so many
points.

220
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,949
You can hardly dojustice to the
subject in so short a time.

221
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,276
Won't you devote the afternoon to
it?

222
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,678
We'll take a walk and you can
thank me at your leisure.

223
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,439
Let us sit here.

224
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,358
I have broken two engagements for
you today...

225
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,875
both of them with Percy Gryce.

226
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,838
How many have you broken for me?

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,830
None.

228
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,514
My only engagement at Bellmont
was with you.

229
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,916
You really came to Bellmont
to see me?

230
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,115
Of course I did.

231
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,836
Why?

232
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,235
l like to seewhat
you're doing.

233
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,550
You're such awonderful spectacle.

234
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,390
Well, now you're here, you can
see the effect first-hand.

235
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,710
I don't think that my coming...

236
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,314
has deflected your course of action
at all.

237
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,029
Give me one. I haven't smoked in
days.

238
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,316
Why such unnatural abstinence?

239
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,269
It is not considered becoming in a
'jeune fille a marier'.

240
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,272
And at the present moment...

241
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,954
I am a 'jeune fille a marier'.

242
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,996
You must suppose me a
dull kind of person...

243
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,798
If you think I never yield
to an impulse.

244
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,439
But I don't suppose that.

245
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,996
Your genius lies in converting
impulses into intentions.

246
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,914
My genius?

247
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,630
My genius would appear to be my
ability...

248
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,360
to do the wrong thing
at the right time.

249
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,919
Or vice-versa.

250
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,279
Is there any final test of genius
but success?

251
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,511
I certainly haven't succeeded.

252
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,274
But you will marry
someone very rich.

253
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,633
What a miserable future you foresee
for me.

254
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,397
Haven't you seen it for yourself?

255
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,875
Of course.

256
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,230
But it seems so much darker when
you show it to me.

257
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,759
Why do you do this to me?

258
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,479
Why do you make the things that l
have chosen seem hateful to me...

259
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,475
if you have nothing
to give me instead?

260
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,108
No. I have nothing to give you.

261
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,039
If I had, it'd be yours,
you know that.

262
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,793
But you belittle me, being so sure
they're the only things I care for.

263
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,519
Isn't it natural for me to belittle
everything I can't offer you?

264
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,558
Do you want to marry me?

265
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,834
No, I don't.

266
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,311
But perhaps I should
ifyou did.

267
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,517
It would be a great risk.

268
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,960
I've never concealed how great.

269
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,713
You are a coward.

270
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,070
No.

271
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,717
It's you who are the coward.

272
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,913
Are you serious?

273
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,869
Why not?

274
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,230
i took no risk in being so.

275
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,590
Why is it that when we meet...

276
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,917
we always play this
elaborate game?

277
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,073
It's getting late.

278
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,839
Let us go down.

279
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,159
l thought Mr Gryce meant
to stay all week.

280
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,276
He did, that's the worst of it.

281
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,318
It shows he's running away
from you.

282
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,954
Bertha's done her work and
poisoned him.

283
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,114
What was it Bertha really
told Percy?

284
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,872
Don't ask me. Horrors.

285
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,637
All I can say is, Lily, that l
can't make you out.

286
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,150
He's not completely lost.

287
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,634
There are ways.

288
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,155
Whatever you do, do nothing.

289
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,510
Lily, you'll never do anything
if you're not serious.

290
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,429
Out of spirits?

291
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,314
I'm a little dull.

292
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,120
Is your last box of Doucet
dresses a failure...

293
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,874
ordid my wife rook you for
everything at bridge?

294
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,675
I have to give up Doucet
dresses and bridge.

295
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,314
I can't afford either any more.

296
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,596
And Judy thinks me a bore.

297
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,956
Fact is, she's angry with me.

298
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,396
Angrywith you? Nonsense.
Mywife's devoted to you.

299
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,229
She's my very best friend, and
that's why I mind vexing her.

300
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,031
I want to make my peace with her.

301
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,274
She has her heart set on my
marrying money.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,433
Agreat deal of money.

303
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,438
You don't mean Percy Gryce?

304
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,115
Good Lord.

305
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,550
How could Judy think you'd
do such a thing?

306
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,792
Sometimes I think a man...

307
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,032
understands a woman's motives
betterthan herown sex does.

308
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,748
Good Lord. I could've
told Judy that.

309
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,274
Oh, by the way, Miss Lily...

310
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,000
I wish you'd try to persuade
Judy to be civil to Rosedale.

311
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,879
I did a neat stroke of business
through him lastweek.

312
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,235
If she'd only ask him to come
and dine now and then...

313
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,436
I'd get almost anything out of him.

314
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,714
He's going to be richer than
all of us one ofthese days.

315
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,437
Would you do me a favour?

316
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,159
A very great favour?

317
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,555
Why, of course.

318
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,389
I don't mean to bore you with all
this...

319
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,154
but I'm entirely dependent on my
aunt...

320
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,276
and though she's very kind,
she gives me no regular allowance.

321
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,351
I have a tiny income of my own
but it's been badly invested.

322
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,514
Seems to bring in less each year.

323
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,238
And recently I've lost money at
cards.

324
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,994
I've paid off my debts,
ofcourse, but...

325
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,116
I dare not tell my aunt.

326
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,277
I can no longergo on living my
present life.

327
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,117
And Percy Gryce?

328
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,916
I can't make that sort of marriage.

329
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,348
You gave him the sack, and that's
why he left by train this morning?

330
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,275
I can make you a handsome sum
without endangering your capital.

331
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,555
I am so ignorant about money
matters...

332
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,315
and I'd be so grateful to
have a good advisor.

333
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,274
Leave it to me.

334
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,079
I'll find a solution.

335
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,754
Really, Lily...

336
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,511
you're as careless and frivolous
as your poor parents were.

337
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,111
Why do you go to Bellmont...

338
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,316
if you don't rememberwhat happened
orwhom you saw there.

339
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,432
But therewas no one new.

340
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,431
Just the usual throng.

341
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,518
Was Mr Selden there?

342
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,030
Yes. He came later.

343
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,034
And Mr Rosedale,
was he there?

344
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,349
No, of course not.

345
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,228
Why do you ask?

346
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,831
Passing interest, merely.

347
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,797
Mr Selden tells me that socially
Mr Rosedale...

348
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,632
is very ubiquitous now.

349
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,428
I have always thought that
men like Rosedale...

350
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,556
and their methods of gaining
fortunes...

351
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,553
were at best, questionable,
at worst, criminal.

352
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,795
To grow richer...

353
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,475
at a time when most people's
investments are shrinking...

354
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,358
strikes me as very bad taste.

355
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,114
But society still uses such men,
ifonly obliquely.

356
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,398
If obliquity were a vice
we should all be tainted.

357
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,679
Only someonewithout family could
make such a vulgar remark.

358
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,396
Aunt Julia, you are my family.

359
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,714
Just as I thought.

360
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,030
Extraordinary that I can't teach
the parlour-maid...

361
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,031
to draw the blinds down evenly.

362
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,191
Will you see to it, Grace?

363
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,199
Jennings, we'll take tea
in the upstairs sitting room.

364
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,671
Lily, you read me the obituaries.

365
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,673
Aunt Julia, Grace does it
so much better than me.

366
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,234
She can make the most insignificant
death seem interesting.

367
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,153
I'll see to the blinds.

368
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,595
Verywell, you mayjoin us later.

369
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,396
It's a Mrs Haffen, Miss.

370
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,796
Shewon't say what she wants.

371
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,913
You want to see me?

372
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,915
Something you might like to see.

373
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,592
You have something belonging to me?

374
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,468
Not exactly.

375
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,189
I don't understand.

376
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,430
If it's not mine,
then why are you here?

377
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,631
When I worked at the Benedick...

378
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,913
I was in charge of cleaning the
gentlemen's rooms.

379
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,710
Most gentlemen are careful about
the letters they get.

380
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,435
Burn them in winter, tear them
into bits in summer.

381
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,715
But Mr Selden wasn't
so particular.

382
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,751
I know nothing ofthese letters.

383
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,033
I have no idea why you've
brought them here.

384
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,554
To sell them.

385
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,392
I saw you coming out of
Mr Selden's rooms.

386
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,793
So I guessed they were worth
more to you than me.

387
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,752
You promised me we'd meet...

388
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,672
when George was away from town.

389
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,308
Although you've forbidden me
to come to you, I will.

390
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,710
I cannot bear George near me.

391
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,632
If he touches me I want to scream.

392
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,189
His very presence is unbearable.

393
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,479
My darling Lawrence, you are
my consolation, my only joy.

394
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,599
In you I find more freedom and
support than I've ever known.

395
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,111
Your devoted Bertha.

396
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,190
What do you want for them?

397
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,552
One hundred and fifty.

398
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,154
One hundred.

399
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,113
I've got to live too.

400
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,034
I've offered you all that I'm
prepared to pay for the letters.

401
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,995
One hundred.

402
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,510
If you would forgive your enemy...

403
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,195
first inflict a hurt on them.

404
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,868
Oh, Bertha.

405
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,474
How could you have been so
indiscreet.

406
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,789
l now pronounce you man and wife.

407
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,156
Never seen you look more lovely.

408
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,834
Oh, Gus.

409
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,551
Lily, I've got a cheque for you.

410
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,789
Another dividend?

411
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,753
You have both Rosedale and me
to thank for it.

412
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,639
I've made you five thousand
on his tip...

413
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,553
And re-invested four
on your behalf.

414
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,915
With promise ofanother big rise.

415
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,910
Well...

416
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,230
I can't thank you properly now.

417
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,154
I don't want to be thanked. I want
you to be nice to Rosedale and me.

418
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,356
I'd like to see you now and then.

419
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,238
Come on overto Bellmont.

420
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,549
I'll send the motor.

421
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,517
You say the most absurd things.

422
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,712
Besides, it's impossible.

423
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,478
My aunt is back in town...

424
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,278
and I must stay with her.

425
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,590
You must come...

426
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,194
to see Mrs Peniston and l
next time you are in town.

427
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,229
Then you can tell me how to better
invest my small fortune.

428
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,992
This is luck.

429
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,353
I was wondering if I'd be able
to have aword with you.

430
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,670
I haven't recovered my self-
respect...

431
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,195
since you showed me how poor
my ambitions were.

432
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,034
On the contrary...

433
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,679
I thought I had been
the means of proving...

434
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,990
they were more important to you
than anything else.

435
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,516
Lily.

436
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,832
We thought you'd given us the slip.

437
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,752
Been hunting all overfor you.

438
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,550
I wanted to invite you to my box...

439
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,915
at the opera
on opening night.

440
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,238
Gus has promised to come
to town on purpose.

441
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,598
He's a tremendous admirerof yours.

442
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,679
I fancy he'd go a lot farther for
the pleasure of seeing you.

443
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,156
The Trenors are my best friends.

444
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,959
l think we'd all go a long way
to see one other.

445
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,518
How's your luck been
lately on Wall street?

446
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,276
I hear Gus pulled off a nice
little pile foryou last month.

447
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,871
I had a little money to invest...

448
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,998
and Mr Trenor has been helping me
in such matters.

449
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,158
I had a lucky turn.

450
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,719
Is that what you call it?

451
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,955
You've had a great many yourself.

452
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,873
Is that the latest creation of the
dressmaker at the Benedick?

453
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,792
If so, it's a great success.

454
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,599
Isn't it, MrSelden?

455
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,839
That's nice of you.

456
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,875
It'd be nicer still ifyou'd
get me a glass of lemonade.

457
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,349
Pleasure.

458
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,230
They met six weeks ago at Bertha
Dorset's...

459
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,317
and have been devoted ever since.

460
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,875
The engagement's to be
announced next week.

461
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,070
They say it'll be the nicest
marriage possible.

462
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,028
One dull fortune
marrying another.

463
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,195
Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce?

464
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,909
Well, well.

465
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,394
Ladies and gentlemen...

466
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,551
Miss Lily Bart, as 'summer'
byWatteau.

467
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,751
She's never looked so radiant.

468
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,635
l like her best in that simple
dress.

469
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,790
Makes her look like the real Lily.

470
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,279
The Lily I know.

471
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,948
The Lilywe know.

472
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,470
She's herselfwith a few people
only.

473
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,432
She has it in her to become
whatever she's believed to be.

474
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,315
We must think the best of her.

475
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,719
I'll tell her that.

476
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,357
She always says you dislike her.

477
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,271
Well, Grace. How's life at
Richfield?

478
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,956
Quiet.

479
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,750
Aunt Peniston sees very little
company.

480
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,070
I'm sure your being there
gave her much pleasure.

481
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,034
I am as reliable
as roast mutton.

482
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,678
But Aunt Julia is not alone...

483
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,354
in preferring Lily's
erratic brilliance.

484
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,919
You should marry, Grace.

485
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,270
We should all marry,
MrSelden.

486
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,472
You never speak to me.

487
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,990
I'm never near you enough.

488
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,677
You think hard things of me.

489
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,793
l think of you...

490
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,433
at any rate.

491
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,310
Why do we never see each other?

492
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,716
I have my law practice and...

493
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,792
you're always surrounded
by admirers.

494
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,554
There's no admirers at my aunt's.

495
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,755
Well...

496
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,236
then, perhaps I might take
tea with you.

497
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,639
At Mrs Peniston's
next week?

498
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,390
Yes.

499
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,392
Come at four on Friday.

500
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,559
Then we can talk.

501
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,637
I've so much to say to you.

502
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,358
I need your help.

503
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,956
You promised me once you'd help me.

504
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,310
The only way I can help you...

505
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,592
is by loving you.

506
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,475
Love me.

507
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,153
But don't tell me so.

508
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,352
I'd hate to miss the train.

509
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,317
Selden, going too?

510
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,357
-Aren't you staying for supper?
-No.

511
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,273
When people crowd their rooms so
you can't get nearanyone...

512
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,351
you wish to speak to I'd sooner go.

513
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,911
My wife was right to stay away.

514
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,391
She says life is too short to spend
it breaking new people in.

515
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,515
Thank you.

516
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,916
Lily and Gus Trenor, you say?

517
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,872
Aunt, of course I don't mean...

518
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,871
Then what do you mean, Grace?

519
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,390
Do people say he's in love with
her?

520
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,835
People always say
unpleasant things.

521
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,552
It's a pity, though, that Lily
makes herself so conspicuous.

522
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,869
Conspicuous?

523
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,115
Does he mean to divorce
then marry her?

524
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,156
No, it's...

525
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,629
it's a flirtation.

526
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,835
Nothing more.

527
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,069
A flirtation?

528
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,152
With a married man?

529
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,274
Such things were never heard of in
my day.

530
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,834
Look here, Lily...

531
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,673
Judy and I've been in town for
weeks. When am I going to see you?

532
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,149
You can find me any afternoon
at my aunt's.

533
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,950
Come see me there and
we can have a quiet talk.

534
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,516
You put me offwith that at the
Van Osburgh wedding.

535
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,196
Truth is, now you've got what you
wanted you'd rather not see me.

536
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,759
Don't be foolish, Gus.

537
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,229
If you want to see me
you can come to my aunt's.

538
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,632
What else is being said?

539
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,833
That Gus Trenor pays her bills.

540
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,750
Rubbish.

541
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,633
Lily has herown income.

542
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,751
And I provide for her handsomely.

543
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,757
There are hergambling debts.

544
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,959
What do you mean?

545
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,752
She plays bridge.

546
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,629
Who told you my niece plays
cards for money?

547
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,509
Mrs Gryce told me that it
was Lily's gambling debts...

548
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,908
that frightened Percy.

549
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,597
In fact people are inclined to
excuse her on that account.

550
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,352
Excuse herforwhat?

551
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,190
Foraccepting the attentions of
men like Gus Trenor.

552
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,837
Thank you fortelling me, Grace.

553
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,234
But I must say, this unwelcome
information...

554
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,516
has ruined the Mozart for me.

555
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,518
Lily, let's leave before the first
act starts.

556
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,433
Judy's as cross as two sticks when
she's away from Bellmont.

557
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,794
Come to the house now.

558
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,393
Is Judy unwell?

559
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,755
A visit from you might be just
what's needed.

560
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,233
Very well, Gus.

561
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,988
I shall come with you.

562
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,833
Doesn't it look as if we're waiting
for the body to be brought down?

563
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,429
Where's Judy?

564
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,916
She's not up to seeing anybody.

565
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,914
You mean to say she's not well
enough to see me?

566
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,629
Devil of a headache.

567
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,799
Quite knocked out by it.

568
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,472
In that case, will you have the
goodness to call me a cab?

569
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,393
Why must you go?

570
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,430
It's late and we are alone.

571
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,598
I must insist.

572
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,555
Always the same old story.

573
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,597
Can't give me five minutes but
you're charming to others.

574
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,149
I only went to that stupid
opera to be with you.

575
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,390
I insist that you call me a cab.

576
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,079
Suppose I won't?

577
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,635
What then?

578
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,714
If you force me I shall
go upstairs to Judy.

579
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,789
Sit down.

580
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,473
I've got aword to say to you.

581
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,269
If you have anything to say to me
you must say it at another time.

582
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,599
I shall go upstairs to Judy unless
you call me a cab at once.

583
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,160
Go upstairs, Judy isn't there.

584
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,115
You mean to say that Judy
is not in this house?

585
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,912
She isn't even in town.

586
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,189
I don't believe you.

587
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,713
My wife's still at Bellmont.

588
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,916
If she were not coming to town
she would have telephoned.

589
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,717
She did.

590
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,199
I received no message.

591
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,759
I didn't send any.

592
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,349
How dare you compromise me in this
way?

593
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,556
Don't take that high tone with me.

594
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,996
I've been patient long enough.

595
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,509
After all...

596
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,877
if you pay for the dinner you're
allowed to sit at the table.

597
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,678
I don't know what you mean.

598
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,758
I didn't begin this business.

599
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,114
Kept out ofthe way.

600
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,510
But I can see fast enough when
I'm being made a fool of.

601
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,228
Nowyou've got what you wanted,
Gus isn't needed any more.

602
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,197
Well that isn't playing fair, Lily.

603
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,356
It's dodging the rules of the game.

604
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,598
And now you've got to pay.

605
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,149
You mean I owe you money?

606
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,236
You told me it was all right.

607
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,632
It was all right. It is all right.

608
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,472
You're welcome to it. All of it.

609
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,916
I just want to be thanked a little.

610
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,433
I have thanked you!

611
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,430
Or do you wish for payment in kind?

612
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,710
No!

613
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,031
If I owe you money, I'll pay you!

614
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,396
You owe me nine thousand dollars.

615
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,589
Nine thousand?

616
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,310
I will pay you.

617
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,553
I suppose you'll go to Selden or
Rosedale for it.

618
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,748
Unless you've settled those
scores already...

619
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,911
and I'm the only one left out
in the cold.

620
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,791
What more do you have to say to me?

621
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,436
Go home.

622
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,793
Come here Lily.

623
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,837
I wish to speak to you.

624
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,918
Ant Julia, it's very late
and I am very tired.

625
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,355
I must insist, Lily.

626
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,238
You're a bad colour, Lily.

627
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,115
This incessant rushing about is
beginning to tell on you.

628
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,112
I don't think it's that.

629
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,477
I've had otherworries.

630
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,594
The fact is...

631
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,873
I owe some money.

632
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,750
I...

633
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,959
I've been foolish.

634
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,717
There are bills that are pressing.

635
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,512
I paid your dressmaker's bill
last October.

636
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,076
But if you owe Madame Celeste
anotherthousand dollars...

637
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,350
She may send me youraccount.

638
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,158
It's a good deal more than that.

639
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,831
A good deal more?

640
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,790
Towhom?

641
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,793
Do I knowthese people?

642
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,872
Some by name,
others by reputation.

643
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,231
Then they're of no consequence.

644
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,755
These debts I speak of
are different.

645
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,109
The fact is...

646
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,350
I've been playing cards.

647
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,748
It's true then?

648
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,030
You play cards for money?

649
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,791
Do you play on Sundays?

650
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,315
You're hard on me, Aunt Julia.

651
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,916
l never really cared for cards...

652
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,150
and one hates to be thought
priggish and one...

653
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,072
drifts into doing what others do.

654
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,235
I've had a dreadful lesson.

655
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,354
If you help me out, I promise...

656
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,112
You needn't make any promises.

657
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,474
It's unnecessary.

658
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,638
When I offered you a home...

659
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,439
I didn't undertake to pay
your gambling debts.

660
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,754
Aunt Julia, you mean
that you won't help me?

661
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,639
I shall certainly not do anything
to give the impression...

662
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,313
that I countenance your behaviour.

663
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,630
Aunt Julia, I will be disgraced!

664
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,869
I consider that you are
disgraced, Lily.

665
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,710
And now I must ask you to leave me.

666
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,953
This scene has been
extremely painful to me...

667
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,955
and I have my own health
to consider.

668
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,157
And tell Jennings I wish to see no-
one until tomorrow afternoon.

669
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,995
And then only Grace Stepney.

670
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,670
Grace?

671
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,795
Yes, Aunt Julia.

672
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,712
Lily, it's after midnight.

673
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,359
What will Aunt Julia think?

674
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,395
I don't care.

675
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,718
I couldn't go to my room.

676
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,789
I hate it so.

677
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,036
Lily, what's happened?

678
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,993
Can't you tell me?

679
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,194
l thought I could
manage my own life...

680
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,875
But I've been so foolish, Grace.

681
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,909
To the point of being compromised.

682
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,069
Bywhom?

683
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,719
Mr Selden?

684
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,360
No, not Mr Selden.

685
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,198
I've been careless and imprudent
about money.

686
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,718
I'm frightened to think what I owe.

687
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,592
Grace, you know Lawrence.

688
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,630
If I asked him to help me...

689
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,633
told him why...

690
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,632
would he loathe me if I told
him everything?

691
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,396
No.

692
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,593
You must not do that.

693
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,351
He is like other men.

694
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,638
They have minds like moral
fly-paper.

695
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,513
They can forgive a woman almost
anything except losing her name.

696
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,717
If you wish to keep your
reputation intact, Lily...

697
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,839
tell him nothing.

698
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,913
But he must've spoken about me.

699
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,991
What does he really think of me?

700
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,351
We've never discussed you, Lily.

701
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,994
I have no ideawhat
Mr Selden thinks.

702
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,636
But I must trust in his good faith.

703
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,114
I'll write him and ask him to come.

704
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,198
Goodnight, Grace.

705
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,519
Goodnight, Lily.

706
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,589
Lawrence!

707
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,955
Lawrence!

708
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,554
Jennings. Is my aunt downstairs?

709
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,948
No, Miss Bart.

710
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,069
Mrs Peniston left for Richfield
early this morning...

711
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,514
with Miss Stepney.

712
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,876
Thank you.

713
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,036
Would you see that the boy delivers
this to Mr Selden at the Benedick?

714
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,155
Yes, Miss.

715
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,038
Would you serve tea at four...

716
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,272
in the downstairs sitting room and
show Mr Selden in when he arrives?

717
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,509
Yes, Miss Bart.

718
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,032
Thank you.

719
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,829
Mr Rosedale.

720
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,759
Pretty well done.

721
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,399
Yes, very well done.

722
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,271
Why put up this kind of bluff?

723
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,158
Why aren't you straight with me?

724
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,276
l know there have been times
when you've been worried.

725
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,749
A girl like you shouldn't have
worries.

726
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,275
You're quite right, Mr Rosedale.

727
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,718
I have had worries.

728
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,110
I've been careless about money.

729
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,749
I'm offering you the chance to turn
your back on that once and for all.

730
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,030
I know you're not in love with me.

731
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,558
You're not even fond of me.

732
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,630
Yet.

733
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,154
I'm very much flattered by your
offer...

734
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,115
but I should be selfish and
ungrateful...

735
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,431
if I made my reason for accepting
your generosity financial.

736
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,959
Miss Bart...

737
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,069
I generally get what
I want in life.

738
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,033
I have a certain social position
and the means to maintain it.

739
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,677
Now all I want is the woman...

740
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,030
the right woman, to share both
with me.

741
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,519
You're fond of luxury and amusement
and to not have to settle for it.

742
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,552
I can provide the style...

743
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,799
and the means of settling.

744
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,151
You're mistaken on one point...

745
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,713
Mr Rosedale.

746
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,678
Whatever I enjoy...

747
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,877
I'm prepared to pay for.

748
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,515
I have spoken too plainly.

749
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,637
I didn't mean to give offence.

750
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,791
Give me time to consider your
kindness.

751
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,799
Goodbye, Miss Bart.

752
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,551
You will consider my proposal?

753
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,869
Of course.

754
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,716
Yes?

755
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,393
Are you alone, Lily?

756
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,792
Yes, quite alone, Bertha.

757
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,113
Everyone has gone away.

758
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,753
My aunt to Richfield,
everyone else to Europe.

759
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,718
Except Lawrence Selden, who's gone
to London.

760
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,757
How unsophisticated of him.

761
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,673
Will you join us then on a cruise
to the Mediterranean?

762
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,236
Well, I'm not sure I'm able to.

763
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,118
You'll be doing me a great service.

764
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,191
You're always good with George...

765
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,511
listening to the stories he's been
telling since the Civil War.

766
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,636
You're the only one with enough
fortitude to take an interest.

767
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,755
Nonsense.

768
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,717
George can be charming.

769
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,518
Good. You'll come then?

770
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,915
Yes. It'll be delightful.

771
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,189
Goodbye.

772
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,788
MrSelden.

773
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,274
Mrs Fisher.

774
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,279
Dojoin us.

775
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,398
What brings you to Monte Carlo?

776
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,994
I finished my business with a
client in London...

777
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,789
and decided to come down and renew
my objective interest in life.

778
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,349
So you're not so far removed from
being manipulated...

779
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,954
by the strings of society
as one might think.

780
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,236
Mrs Fisher, none of us are.

781
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,232
We're starving to death because we
can't decide where to lunch.

782
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,153
One gets the best things at ''The
Terrasse''...

783
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,189
but all the Americans go there now.

784
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,351
I do believe the Dorsets are back.

785
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,799
It's their yacht...

786
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,788
"The Sabrina"

787
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,595
Oh, yes.

788
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,312
I often have this strange and
vivid dream...

789
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,270
of an unknown woman
whom I love and who loves me...

790
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,954
and who, each time,
is neither exactly the same...

791
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,912
nor exactly different but
who loves me and understand me.

792
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,470
For she understands me and
my heart is transparent...

793
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,229
to her alone, alasl
Which ceases to be a problem...

794
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,433
to her alone, and the sweat
of my pale brow.

795
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,269
She alone knows
how to cool it with tears.

796
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,238
Is she brunette,
blonde or red-head?

797
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,198
He's reading Verlaine to her now.

798
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,875
In French.

799
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,910
What's the use of mincing matters?

800
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,919
We all know what Bertha brought
Lily abroad for.

801
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,719
The Silverton affair is
at the acute stage.

802
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,916
George needs to be distracted.

803
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,833
And I'm sure Lily distracts him.

804
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,074
A clever woman would know when
to play her cards right.

805
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,114
But she's never been clever in
that way.

806
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,630
I hope there hasn't been
a row.

807
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,794
Where the devil are they?

808
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,110
Bertha!

809
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,355
Bertha!

810
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,716
How did you find London,
Mr Selden?

811
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,437
More agreeable than NewYork?

812
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,749
In someways, yes.

813
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,190
Nevertheless, I came to see you.

814
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,315
To see me?

815
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,557
Or to see an older friend?

816
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,637
I beg you to leave the yacht.

817
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,869
To leave?

818
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,708
Why? What has happened?

819
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,190
Nothing. But if something should,
why be in the way of it?

820
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,636
How do you think I'd leave Bertha?

821
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,196
You have yourself to think of now.

822
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,319
Nothing will happen.

823
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,597
Of course not. I'm sure.

824
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,509
Have you seen Bertha?

825
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,511
No.

826
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,479
Is she not up yet?

827
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,870
Not up yet!

828
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,394
Has she gone to bed?

829
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,550
You know what time she came
aboard this morning?

830
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,909
At seven!

831
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,275
Seven?

832
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,788
Was there an accident?

833
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,712
There was no accident.

834
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,438
I waited for them all night.

835
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,828
Why didn't you call me
to share your vigil?

836
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,795
You wouldn't have liked the
denouement.

837
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,595
The denouement?

838
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,352
Isn't that too big a word for
such a small incident?

839
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,270
Don't!

840
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,636
Don't!

841
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,038
I only want to help you.

842
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,953
You do so by being sweet
and patientwith me.

843
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,270
You can't want to see me
ridiculous.

844
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,311
If it hadn't been for you I'd
have ended it long ago.

845
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,994
I'll go to see Selden.

846
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,030
No!

847
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,430
No.

848
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,395
Why not?

849
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,316
One lawyer is as good as another.

850
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,630
Very well.

851
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,197
Go and see Mr Selden then.

852
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,869
You'll have time before dinner.

853
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,870
I ought to say good morning.

854
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,954
l tried to see you but
you weren't up.

855
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,317
No. I got to bed late.

856
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,358
Afterwe separated during the
fete, we thoughtwe should wait...

857
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,152
butwe missed you.

858
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,719
You missed us?

859
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,073
But I thought you didn't get back
to the yacht until this morning.

860
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,353
Who told you that?

861
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,470
George.

862
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,759
Is that his version?

863
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,509
Poor George.

864
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,837
He's had one of his attacks again.

865
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,556
It's very bad for him to be
worried.

866
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,917
Anything upsetting always brings
on an attack.

867
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,070
''Anything upsetting''?

868
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,836
Yes.

869
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,670
Such as having you so
conspicuously on his hands...

870
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,990
during the small hours.

871
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,116
You know, my dear, you're
rather a responsibility...

872
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,675
in such a scandalous place after
midnight.

873
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,356
Well really...

874
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,231
considering you burdened him with
that responsibility.

875
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,756
A married man should not have the
burden of being seen alone...

876
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,353
with a single woman.

877
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,038
Yes, we were alone.

878
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,958
Is that so dreadful?

879
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,195
After all, we lost you as much
as you mislaid us.

880
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,078
So now it is my fault...

881
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,038
for not having the superhuman
cleverness to find you...

882
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,872
in that dreadful crowd?

883
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,758
Or the imagination to believe...

884
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,833
that you wouldn't wait for us on
the quay until we met you?

885
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,639
No, simply by us
all keeping together!

886
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,234
''Keeping together''?

887
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,758
Lily, you are not a child
to be led by the hand.

888
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,112
Nor to be lectured, Bertha.

889
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,989
Lecture you?

890
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,588
Heaven forbid.

891
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,794
I was merely trying to give you
a friendly hint.

892
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,433
It's usually the other way round.
I'm expected to take hints...

893
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,397
not to give them.

894
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,350
Hints?

895
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,309
From me to you?

896
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,557
Negative ones merely.

897
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,798
What not to be or to do
or to see.

898
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,159
But if you'll let me say so...

899
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,595
I didn't knowone of my negative
duties...

900
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,594
was not to warn you when you took
your imprudence too far.

901
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,399
Did you see George today?

902
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:53,836
Yes.

903
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,034
Well...

904
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,514
What happened?

905
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,348
What will happen?

906
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,399
Nothing, as yet.

907
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,952
And nothing in the future.

908
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,995
You're sure?

909
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,959
I'm not sure, but I'm
a good deal surer.

910
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,229
No, thank you.

911
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,070
Assume everything
is as usual.

912
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,956
Before I go I want to
leave you the Brys.

913
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,710
Charming ofyou to remember me.

914
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,710
What you really mean is...

915
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,348
that you've snubbed the Brys
and you know they know it.

916
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,270
Carry!

917
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,237
If you'd have even managed to
have them invited...

918
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,435
onto "The Sabrina" once.

919
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,431
Especially when royalty was
coming.

920
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,518
Stay over and I'll get the
Duchess to dine with them.

921
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,113
I shan't stay over.

922
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,829
The Gormers have paid for
my salon-lit and I leave tonight.

923
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,274
But get her to dine with them all
the same.

924
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,911
I've danced all my life, you're my
husband.

925
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,112
They'd be much obliged.

926
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,269
Do you sing?

927
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,075
Really?

928
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,678
Lily, if you're offto the yacht.

929
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,908
Miss Bart is not returning to the
yacht.

930
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,515
Bertha...

931
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,028
Miss Bart...

932
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,072
there's been a misunderstanding.

933
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,074
Some mistake.

934
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,235
Miss Bart...

935
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,999
remains here.

936
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,353
And I think, George, we'd better
not detain our guests any longer.

937
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,270
I have some business to attend
to...

938
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,238
and it's easier for me to remain
ashore forthe night.

939
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,195
Mr Selden, you promised to see me
to my cab.

940
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,432
Do you know of a quiet hotel?

941
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,636
To go to alone? lmpossible.

942
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,109
Well, it's too wet to sleep
outside.

943
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,471
There must be someone you can go
to.

944
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,470
At this hour?

945
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,517
God, ifyou'd only listened to me.

946
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,317
Not now.

947
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,551
You must go immediately to the
Stepneys.

948
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,792
I can't. You mustn't ask me to.
You don't know Gwen.

949
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,996
Come, you must appear to have gone
there directly.

950
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,070
What if she refuses?

951
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,832
Shewon't. Trust me.

952
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,277
I, Julia Grace Peniston...

953
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,398
being of sound
mind and body...

954
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,949
declare this to be my last
will and testament...

955
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,157
hereby revoking and declaring
utterly void...

956
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,074
all wills and clauses of wills
here to fore made by me.

957
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,789
It is my will and desire that,
after my death...

958
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,515
all my just debts shall be
paid by my executive...

959
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,035
here in after named.

960
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,191
Second, it is my will and
desire...

961
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,551
Lily will get everything, of
course.

962
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,269
Aunt Julia was always
a just woman.

963
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,796
Well, it's only about four hundred
thousand.

964
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,789
Eight. And to my niece,
Miss Lily Bart...

965
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,391
l bequeath the sum of ten thousand
dollars.

966
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,669
Nine. And the residue
of my estate...

967
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,876
l bequeath to my dear niece...

968
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,716
Grace Julia Stepney.

969
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,152
Given under my hand and seal...

970
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,999
22nd May 1906.

971
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,599
My dear Grace.

972
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,159
I am so glad.

973
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,151
What sweet shall we have today?

974
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,150
Lily!

975
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,788
My dear Carry,...

976
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,394
you wouldn't let the head waiter
see I've nothing to live on...

977
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,152
but my Aunt Julia's legacy?

978
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,317
Think of Bertha Dorset's
satisfaction...

979
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,830
if she came and found us lunching
on cold mutton and tea.

980
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,793
I was horrid to you in Monte
Carlo, Lily.

981
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,313
I'm ashamed of myself...

982
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,552
and I've wanted to tell you so
ever since, and that's the truth.

983
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,359
Well, what is truth?

984
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,709
Where a woman is concerned it's a
story that's easiest to believe.

985
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,432
If I'd have got the money,
no-one would dare ignore me.

986
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,558
And if they did, it wouldn't
matter. I'd be independent.

987
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,030
Lily.

988
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,669
It's so unjust.

989
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,991
Grace Stepney must feel she has no
right to that inheritance.

990
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,313
Anyone who knew how to please Aunt
Julia has a right to her money.

991
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,754
But she was devoted to you.

992
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,714
Be honest, Carry.

993
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,757
She disapproved of my going with
the Dorsets...

994
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,559
and she heard of my break
with them.

995
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,439
After all, Bertha did
turn me off the yacht.

996
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,119
I must know where I stand,
Carry.

997
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,356
And know what's being said of me.

998
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,629
I don't listen.

999
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,553
One hears such things without
listening.

1000
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,153
Good afternoon, Mrs Fisher.

1001
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,276
Carry, how delightful to see you.

1002
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,754
How delightful, Judy.

1003
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,879
Oh, Lily.

1004
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,953
What a pleasure to see you.

1005
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,716
Gus!

1006
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,149
Miss Bart.

1007
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,677
I must see the head waiter, Judy.

1008
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,313
Where Judy leads, the world will
follow.

1009
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,998
Not your real friends.

1010
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,548
Meanwhile, what do you say to
putting a few things in a trunk...

1011
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,757
and spending the summer with
me and the Gormers?

1012
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,039
To take me out of my ''friends'''
way you mean?

1013
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,152
Till they realise how much they
miss you.

1014
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,791
Besides, the Gormers have taken
a tremendous fancy to you.

1015
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,199
I know they're not yourset, kind
of a social Coney Island.

1016
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,553
But anyone's welcome who can make
noise and doesn't put on airs.

1017
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:03,791
Yes.

1018
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,756
I shall come.

1019
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,476
Well, what shall it be?

1020
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,315
Coup Jacques
orPechesa la Melba?

1021
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,236
The more I think of my getting
you here, the better I like it.

1022
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,716
More noise, more colour,
more slapdash sociability.

1023
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,599
But greater good nature too.

1024
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:41,795
Less rivalry.

1025
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,393
Yes, it's true.

1026
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,035
Soon everybody will be leaving...

1027
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,554
for Newport and Bar Harbour
and Long Island.

1028
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,194
And me to a hotel in
broiling NewYork.

1029
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,350
Lily...

1030
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,513
you must marry.

1031
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,079
As soon as you can.

1032
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,479
Do you mean to recommend me
to 'a good man's love'?

1033
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,110
Neitherof my candidates answers
to that description.

1034
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:14,996
Neither?

1035
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,434
There are actually two?

1036
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,152
Perhaps one-and-a-half.

1037
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,189
All things being equal, I think
I'd prefer half a husband.

1038
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,349
Who is he?

1039
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,913
George Dorset.

1040
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,429
Don't fly out at me till
you hear my reasons.

1041
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,592
Since they got back from Europe
things have been going very badly.

1042
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,513
Bertha's behaviour has strained
even George's credulity.

1043
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,399
They're over at their place now
but the end will come soon.

1044
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,834
The end will nevercome.

1045
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,557
Bertha will always get him back
exactly when shewants him.

1046
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,275
Oh, Lily.

1047
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,229
He wouldn't stay with her ten
minutes if he knew.

1048
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,590
"Knew"?

1049
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,115
If he had positive proof, I mean.

1050
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,195
Please, let's drop the subject.

1051
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,594
It's too odious to me.

1052
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,472
And the second candidate?

1053
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,073
We mustn't forget him.

1054
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,998
Sim Rosedale.

1055
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,038
l think I'd like to go fora walk.

1056
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,155
Miss Bart.

1057
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,433
I've been hoping to meet you.

1058
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,958
I'd have written if I'd dared.

1059
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,757
I wanted to apologise.

1060
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,559
Don't let us speak of it.

1061
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,031
I was very sorry for you.

1062
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,072
You must let me explain.

1063
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,914
I was deceived.

1064
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,956
I am more sorry for you then.

1065
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,551
But you must see that
I am not exactly...

1066
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,870
the person with whom this subject
can be discussed.

1067
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,436
Why not?

1068
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,319
It's you of all people I owe
an explanation to.

1069
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,317
No explanation is necessary.

1070
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,430
The situation was perfectly
clear to me.

1071
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,876
Miss Bart, don't turn away.

1072
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,628
You must understand...

1073
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,190
that afterwhat happened, we
cannot be friends again.

1074
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,032
Wasn't I punished enough?

1075
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,592
Is there to be no respite?

1076
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,115
I'd have thought you had complete
respite...

1077
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,113
in the reconciliation that was
effected at my expense.

1078
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,232
Don't put it that way.

1079
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,914
All I ask you to understand is
that...

1080
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,316
after the use that Bertha made of
me...

1081
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,913
after all that her behaviour has
since implied...

1082
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,439
it is impossible that you and l
should meet.

1083
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:04,995
Please help me.

1084
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,715
I am sorry.

1085
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,072
There is nothing I can do.

1086
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,998
You must have other friends...

1087
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,718
otheradvisors.

1088
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,191
l never had a friend like you.

1089
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,836
Besides, you're the only one who
knows.

1090
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,630
You were there in Monte Carlo.

1091
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,119
You are mistaken.

1092
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,028
I saw nothing.

1093
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,794
l know nothing.

1094
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,799
Just saywhat you know and the
way will be clearfor us both.

1095
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,109
l know nothing.

1096
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,836
You are sacrificing both of us.

1097
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,389
l know nothing.

1098
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,393
Absolutely nothing.

1099
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,194
Who's gonna catch you?

1100
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,955
Come along.

1101
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,438
You ought to be in bed.

1102
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,269
Yes, mother.

1103
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,158
Goodnight, Miss Bart.

1104
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,548
Goodnight, Edith.

1105
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:31,636
Go on.

1106
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,955
Where are the others?

1107
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,470
I'm your only fellow guest.

1108
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,914
Carry was trying to be subtle.

1109
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,074
You look tired,

1110
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,799
I've been sleeping badly.

1111
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,313
In fact, I came especially
to see you.

1112
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,193
On a delicate matter.

1113
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,118
I hope you can believe that.

1114
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,320
Thank you, I believe what you say.

1115
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,839
lIyou wish.

1116
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,874
But, Miss Lily...

1117
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,110
I suppose that is what you wish.

1118
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,198
And though I was unable to consent
when last you spoke to me...

1119
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,238
I am ready, now that I know you
much better...

1120
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,436
to put my happiness in your hands.

1121
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,232
My dear Miss Lily...

1122
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,312
you made me feel that my suit was
so hopeless that...

1123
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,630
I had no intention of renewing it.

1124
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,274
I can only blame myself...

1125
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,432
if I gave you the impression
that my decision was final.

1126
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,833
Before we say goodbye...

1127
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,749
I want at least to thank you for
once having thought of me.

1128
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,636
Why do you talk of saying goodbye?

1129
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,588
Can't we still be good friends
all the same?

1130
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,994
What is your idea of being
"good friends"?

1131
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,154
Seeing me without asking me
to marry you?

1132
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,512
That's about the size of it.

1133
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,873
I like your frankness...

1134
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,593
I'm afraid that our friendship...

1135
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,354
can hardly continue
on those terms.

1136
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,748
Miss Lily, what I mean...

1137
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,639
What you mean to say is that
I'm not as desirable a match...

1138
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,392
as once you thought me.

1139
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,999
Yes, that is what I do mean.

1140
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,991
I don't believe the stories about
you...

1141
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,355
but my not believing them
won't alter the situation.

1142
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,080
If they are not true, doesn't that
alter the situation?

1143
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,199
You know as well as I do, last
year you wouldn't look at me.

1144
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,998
Now you appear willing to do so.

1145
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,471
What's changed in the interval?

1146
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,113
Your situation.

1147
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,871
You thought you could do better.

1148
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,553
You think you can?

1149
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,109
Yes, I do.

1150
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,953
I've done verywell.

1151
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,311
I've placed Wall Street under
obligations...

1152
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,391
that only 5th Avenue can repay.

1153
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,036
But the quickest way to queer
oneself with the right people...

1154
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,111
is to be seen with the wrong ones.

1155
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,631
I want to avoid mistakes.

1156
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,589
I understand.

1157
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,838
Goodbye, Mr Rosedale.

1158
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,437
Why don't you use her letters?

1159
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,960
Don't ask me how I know you
bought them.

1160
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,189
I know.

1161
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,193
I don't suppose you bought them
just to collect autographs.

1162
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,396
You see, I know where you stand.

1163
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,150
You have Bertha completely
in your power.

1164
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,876
You wish to be rehabilitated
socially...

1165
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,390
and you have the means of your
redemption.

1166
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:16,033
In a deal like this, nobody comes
out with perfectly clean hands.

1167
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:21,434
If you're going to fight Bertha,
don't inflict an open injury.

1168
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,995
Reduce it to a private
transaction.

1169
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,593
'Give and take' you mean?

1170
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,036
Yes.

1171
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:31,715
As in business.

1172
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,995
Or politics.

1173
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,633
You see how simple it is?

1174
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,312
There's no point frightening
Bertha into line.

1175
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,472
You have to keep her there.

1176
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,558
That's my part of the business.

1177
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,632
That's what I'm offering you.

1178
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,635
To reconcile with Bertha and then
you'll marry me?

1179
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,592
What do you say, Miss Lily?

1180
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,028
You are mistaken in both the facts
and what you infer from them.

1181
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,512
Well, I'll be damned!

1182
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,991
I suppose it's because the
letters are to him?

1183
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,276
I thought we understood each
other.

1184
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,393
We do now.

1185
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,669
Come in.

1186
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,317
It's such a blessing to have a
quiet few weeks here.

1187
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,190
Thank you for inviting me here.

1188
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,712
I do love it in Tuxedo.

1189
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:53,591
Yes.

1190
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,433
It's a pleasant house.

1191
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,794
One of my few treasured
possessions.

1192
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,919
How are the Brys?

1193
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,394
Louisa Bry is a stern taskmaster.

1194
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,230
Talk about love making
peoplejealous.

1195
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,197
It's nothing to social ambition.

1196
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,032
I had a visit from Mattie Gormer
the other day.

1197
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,435
She was with Bertha Dorset
of all people.

1198
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,833
No doubt the rabbit always thinks
it's fascinating the anaconda.

1199
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,871
Now they're fast friends...

1200
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,429
I think Mattie will sacrifice
anything for her.

1201
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,279
Including me?

1202
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,794
My dear...

1203
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,871
the world is vile.

1204
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:12,516
Lily.

1205
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,958
Mrs Hatch, I'm not dressed!

1206
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,519
It doesn't matter.

1207
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,433
This is the 20th Century,
not the Dark Ages.

1208
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,034
As soon as you've eaten,
come to my rooms.

1209
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,435
I'm leaving in twenty minutes,
so please be quick.

1210
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,797
I cannot find my prescription.

1211
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,915
Do you have it?

1212
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,195
I'm always losing them.

1213
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,351
You usually leave them on your
bureau, Mrs Hatch.

1214
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,589
Of course I do.

1215
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,557
Get it filled for me today.

1216
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,597
Without my chloral I never sleep.

1217
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,990
I have to see my beauty doctor
or I cannot face society.

1218
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,830
The manicure will have to wait
till tomorrow.

1219
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,031
Not up to it today, put heroff.

1220
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,397
Don't look sour, Lily,
she won't mind.

1221
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,629
She never minds.

1222
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,472
After lunch I shall go to
Sherry's for tea...

1223
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,995
then this evening I'm playing
bridge with my lawyer.

1224
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,832
I'll try to go for a fitting
tomorrow morning...

1225
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,560
but only if it doesn't interfere
with the art exhibition at four.

1226
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,038
Then supperat...

1227
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,031
No, theatre first, then supper.

1228
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,272
If you don't tell me in advance
of these changes, How can I...

1229
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,873
keep your diary accurately?

1230
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,191
Engagements are made to be broken.
Especially with tradespeople.

1231
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,679
They expect it.

1232
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,034
Yes, Mrs Hatch.

1233
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,395
By the way, Lily...

1234
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,269
on Friday I'm dining with Melville
Stancy and the Gormers.

1235
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,670
Yes, Mrs Hatch.

1236
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,558
Don't forget my prescription.

1237
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,233
It's on the bureau.

1238
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,272
Mrs Fisher was anxious to know
how you were getting on.

1239
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,635
Why didn't she look me up
herself then?

1240
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,198
Afraid of being importunate.

1241
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,240
You see, no such scruples
restrained me.

1242
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,438
Then you've come to be
of some use to me?

1243
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,710
Yes.

1244
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,159
So what am I to do with you?

1245
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,834
Talk things overwith me.

1246
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,236
What makes you think that I have
anything to talk about?

1247
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:04,835
My initiative doesn't go beyond
putting myself at your disposal.

1248
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,998
I shouldn't have come if I'd
thought I'd be of no use to you.

1249
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,072
Do you know where you are?

1250
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,032
Of course I know where I am!

1251
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,951
You must let me take you away from
here.

1252
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,033
If you've come to say disagreeable
things about Mrs Hatch...

1253
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,589
It is precisely your relationship
with her that concerns me.

1254
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,352
My relationshipwith Mrs Hatch...

1255
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,909
is one that I've no reason to be
ashamed of!

1256
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,274
She's helped me earn a living...

1257
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,079
when my old friends were quite
content to see me starve!

1258
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,150
Nonsense!

1259
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,231
Starvation is not the only
alternative.

1260
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,233
Your aunt's legacy could make you
moderately independent.

1261
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,357
Well, what you don't know...

1262
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,830
is that I owe every penny
of that legacy!

1263
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,635
Good God!

1264
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,114
Every penny...

1265
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,514
and more besides.

1266
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,630
I have no money except my small
income...

1267
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,076
and I need to earn money to keep
myself alive!

1268
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,709
I should be happier to see you out
of this particular 'employment'.

1269
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,439
But I should not.

1270
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,151
ljust want to point out to you...

1271
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,470
the false position you have placed
yourself in.

1272
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,599
I suppose by that you mean my
being on the outside of society?

1273
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,876
But I have long been excluded
from it...

1274
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,838
and I remember you once telling me
that it was only those on...

1275
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,150
the inside who took the difference
seriously!

1276
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,437
Mrs Hatch's desire to be inside...

1277
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,431
may put you in a false position.

1278
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,635
You cannot want this!

1279
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:37,028
You have already told me that the
sole object of my upbringing...

1280
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,993
was to teach me to getwhat
I want.

1281
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,995
Why not assume that that's
precisely what I am doing now?

1282
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,439
You're not a successful example...

1283
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,795
of that kind of upbringing.
Give me a little more time.

1284
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,230
I may still do credit to my
training!

1285
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,278
That was undignified.

1286
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,715
Where does dignity end and
rectitude begin?

1287
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,119
Good day, Miss Bart.

1288
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,631
Good day, Mr Selden.

1289
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:40,917
She got five dollars and her
picture in the paper.

1290
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:41,876
The hat?

1291
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,473
No, she got that yesterday.

1292
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,671
No, the one with the green
paradise.

1293
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,992
Madame asked me to alter that
Virot hat.

1294
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,548
She's tall, slight,
but her hair's all frizzed out.

1295
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,359
A lot like Mary Leach.

1296
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,239
Only thinner.

1297
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:09,715
Miss Bart.

1298
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,157
Look at these spangles.
Every one sewed on crooked.

1299
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,676
I'm sorry.

1300
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,553
I'm afraid I'm not well.

1301
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,877
If you can't do better, I'll
give the hat to Miss Kilroy.

1302
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,832
Go back to binding edges.

1303
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,389
Miss Bart.

1304
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,355
Miss Bart, I must draw your
attention...

1305
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,034
to the fact that yourwork
is poor...

1306
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,553
and your attendance irregular.

1307
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,591
Miss Haines is right.

1308
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,550
I am clumsy and slow to learn.

1309
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,108
I have been indisposed lately.

1310
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,637
But I'll try to improve.

1311
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,193
It's too late for that.

1312
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,430
I took you on as an untrained
apprentice...

1313
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,875
as a favourto Mrs Fisher...

1314
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,917
but against my betterjudgement.

1315
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,358
I'm afraid that I will have to
dispense with your services.

1316
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,352
I trust you'll find a position
more suited to your skills.

1317
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,515
Thank you.

1318
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,068
How are you, Grace?

1319
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,195
Her memory is everywhere.

1320
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,913
The whole house.

1321
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,113
And you, Lily...

1322
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,754
how are you?

1323
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,116
You look dreadfully tired.

1324
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,033
I don't sleep at night.

1325
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,713
Since when?

1326
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,428
I don't...

1327
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,279
I can't remember.

1328
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,431
There are otherworries.

1329
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,439
Dreadful things.

1330
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,908
What things?

1331
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,954
Poverty.

1332
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,275
I can't think ofanything worse.

1333
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,149
I can't go on this way.

1334
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,559
Do you have any idea when the
legacies will be paid?

1335
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,395
No, Lily.

1336
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,955
No-one has received them yet.

1337
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,593
Not even me.

1338
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,353
The truth is, I need the money.

1339
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,709
Would you be willing to lend me
the amount of my legacy?

1340
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,236
You must be patient.

1341
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,159
Remember how beautifully patient
Aunt Julia always was.

1342
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,875
But you'll get everything, Grace.

1343
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,594
It would be easy foryou to borrow
ten times the amount...

1344
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,273
that I'm asking for.

1345
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,636
Borrow?

1346
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,874
I am at the end of my tether.

1347
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,908
You imagine fora moment that I'd
raise money...

1348
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,436
on my expectations from
Aunt Julia?

1349
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,631
If you must know the truth...

1350
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:55,791
it was your being in debt...

1351
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,632
that brought on her last illness.

1352
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,912
You won't help me then?

1353
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,714
If there's anything I can do...

1354
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,440
to make you realise the folly of
your course and ...

1355
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,354
how much she disapproved of it...

1356
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,633
I shall feel it is the truest way
of making up to you for her loss.

1357
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,319
Thank you, Grace.

1358
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,116
It was good of you to see me.

1359
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,429
Goodbye.

1360
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,709
Can I help?

1361
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,148
Mrs Hatch?

1362
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:45,716
Yes.

1363
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,189
You mustn't increase the dose,
Mrs Hatch.

1364
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,315
Of course not.

1365
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,069
Miss Lily?

1366
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,068
What's the matter?

1367
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,156
I'm a little tired.

1368
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:29,635
It's nothing.

1369
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,197
Stay with me a moment, please.

1370
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,114
We can't stay here.

1371
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,840
Let's go to The Longworth
for some tea.

1372
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,758
Take your tea strong.

1373
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,751
I haven't seen you in ages...

1374
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,751
I wondered what had become of you.

1375
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,196
I have joined the working classes.

1376
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,110
I was trying to learn to become a
milliner.

1377
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,872
You can't be serious.

1378
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,793
Perfectly serious.

1379
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,199
I understood that you were with
Mrs Hatch.

1380
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,716
She dismissed me two months ago.

1381
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,078
After she had got into society...

1382
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,800
it seems my reputation had become
a social liability.

1383
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,556
Since then I have been obliged to
work for my living.

1384
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,518
That wasn't for you anyhow.

1385
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,035
I must go.

1386
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,997
No, no, rest a little longer.

1387
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,276
What did you mean about learning
to become a milliner?

1388
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,759
Just what I said.

1389
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,835
I am an apprentice at Madame
Regina's.

1390
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,994
I was an apprentice at Madame
Regina's.

1391
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,553
I understood you received a legacy
from your aunt.

1392
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,673
Ten thousand dollars.

1393
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:14,715
But it isn't paid until spring and
anyway, I owe it already.

1394
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,588
Thewhole ten thousand?

1395
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,593
Every penny.

1396
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,912
I think Gus Trenorspoke to you
once...

1397
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,878
about having made me some money in
stocks.

1398
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,676
He made me nine thousand dollars.

1399
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,840
I knew nothing about business.

1400
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:40,909
I thought he had invested my
own money.

1401
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,752
In fact what he had made
he had given me.

1402
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,552
It was meant in kindness...

1403
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:53,670
but it wasn't the sort of
obligation I could remain under.

1404
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,711
I was incredibly stupid.

1405
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:01,070
I spent the money before
I realised.

1406
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,356
And so my aunt's legacy must
go to pay it back.

1407
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,154
That is why...

1408
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,831
That is why I must now work.

1409
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,556
That'll clean you out altogether.

1410
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,109
Altogether.

1411
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:21,790
Yes.

1412
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,196
Miss Lily, ifyou want my
backing...

1413
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,236
Thank you.

1414
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,674
Yourtea has been a great backing.

1415
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,235
I feel equal to anything now.

1416
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:54,237
Surely this isn't the place?

1417
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:56,109
Yes.

1418
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:57,953
I room and board here.

1419
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,028
I have lived too long
on my friends.

1420
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,036
You can't go on living here.

1421
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,999
I have gone over my expenses
very carefully...

1422
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,311
and I think I can manage it.

1423
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,913
That's notwhat I mean.

1424
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,752
It is what I mean.

1425
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,276
I shall be out ofwork now.

1426
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,438
What a way for you to talk.

1427
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,318
You in a place like this.

1428
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,475
My situation is nothing
exceptional.

1429
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,079
But you are.

1430
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,752
It's an outrage.

1431
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,680
Look, it's none of my business...

1432
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,956
but you must accept help from
somebody.

1433
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,669
You spoke to me ofyourdebt
to Gus Trenor...

1434
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,753
I'll lend you the money
to pay him.

1435
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,830
Let me finish.

1436
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,230
It'll be purely a business
arrangement.

1437
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,671
What can you have against that?

1438
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:28,948
Only this...

1439
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:32,838
that is exactly what Gus Trenor
proposed.

1440
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:36,551
Once the debt is paid I shall have
no security.

1441
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,592
I have been compromised once...

1442
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,478
I cannot be so again.

1443
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,956
I am very grateful foryour
kindness...

1444
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,476
but it is impossible.

1445
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,759
You must see that.

1446
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,394
We must think of your future.

1447
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:14,233
If you only knew what little
difference that makes now.

1448
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,348
At least let me tell Selden
where you're living.

1449
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,509
It will do no good.

1450
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:24,556
Please.

1451
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,789
Very well.

1452
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,475
You may tell him if you wish.

1453
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:41,995
If only you'd let me help you...

1454
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,874
you could wipe your feet on
them.

1455
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,630
Why don't you use the letters?

1456
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,958
It would be so simple.

1457
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,272
It is so simple.

1458
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,959
Today I'll tell you about the
plight of...

1459
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:55,714
the poor people of Russia under
the Tsar.

1460
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,989
Would you please inform
Mrs Dorset...

1461
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:26,390
that Miss Lily Bart wishes to
speak with her.

1462
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:28,551
Mrs Dorset is not at home, Miss
Bart.

1463
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,956
Then I'd like to speak with
Mr Dorset.

1464
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:37,153
I'm sorry, Mrand Mrs Dorset left
for the country two days ago.

1465
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,352
Shall I take a message?

1466
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,230
No.

1467
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:49,875
No message.

1468
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,558
I can recommend the armchair.

1469
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:25,074
I came to say I am sorry
for the way we parted.

1470
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,278
Forwhat I said to you
that day at Mrs Hatch's.

1471
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,598
I was sorry too.

1472
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,158
You look tired.

1473
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:47,669
Do sit down.

1474
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:57,469
You're drenched.

1475
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,513
Let me make you some tea.

1476
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:00,430
No.

1477
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,992
I must go in a moment.

1478
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:08,954
I must go.

1479
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:15,474
I may not see you again
for a long time...

1480
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:21,712
I have never forgotten the things
you said to me at Bellmont...

1481
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,390
they have helped keep me...

1482
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,994
from becoming the person many
people thought me to be.

1483
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,549
I'm glad.

1484
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:35,837
But nothing I said really
made the difference.

1485
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,638
The difference is in yourself.

1486
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,199
No, don't say that.

1487
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:42,949
That is all that I have
lived on.

1488
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,312
Don't take that from me.

1489
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:54,158
We resist the great temptations...

1490
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:59,994
but it is the little ones that
eventually pull us down.

1491
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:06,673
I remember your saying that such a
life could never satisfy me...

1492
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:09,954
and I was ashamed to admit
that it could.

1493
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,675
That's what I wanted
to thank you for.

1494
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:19,678
I have tried.

1495
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,158
I have tried hard.

1496
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,757
But life is difficult...

1497
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,270
and I'm a useless person.

1498
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,349
And now I'm on the rubbish heap.

1499
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,075
Lily...

1500
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,912
can I help you?

1501
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:51,639
You told me once that you could
help me only by loving me.

1502
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:56,036
You did love me for a moment...

1503
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,679
and it helped me.

1504
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,390
But that moment is gone.

1505
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:04,917
And I let it go.

1506
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:09,158
And one must go on living.

1507
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,589
Lily, you mustn't speak like this.

1508
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,676
Things...

1509
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,478
may change, but...

1510
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,110
you'll never go out of my life.

1511
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:51,713
Let us be friends.

1512
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,871
Then I shall feel safe...

1513
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:00,159
whatever happens.

1514
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,673
What do you mean?

1515
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,754
What's going to happen?

1516
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,076
Nothing.

1517
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:09,514
Nothing's going to happen.

1518
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:15,391
But I'd like some tea now.

1519
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,479
Goodbye, Lawrence.

1520
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:09,154
The WaldorfSavingBank
West53rdstreet. New York.

1521
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:31,918
Ten thousand dollars.

1522
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:37,196
Ten...

1523
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,033
thousand dollars.

1524
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:54,398
CharlesAugustus Trenor

1525
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,149
Oh, Lily!

1526
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,030
Lily?

1527
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:39,235
Miss Bart?

1528
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,392
It's a great mercy.

1529
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,909
May I...

1530
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,634
may I see her...

1531
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:54,355
alone?

1532
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:56,718
Will it take long?

1533
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,034
It won't.

1534
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,755
Lily.

1535
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,953
Oh, Lily.

1536
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,069
I love you.
