- CHALMERS: Mr. Smith?
- SMITH: Yes.

180
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,927
- CHALMERS: Have a look at this.
- SMITH: Of course.

181
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,883
(typing and clacking)

182
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,433
(typing and clacking continues)

183
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,571
SMITH:
Yes, yes, I see it.

184
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,112
Thank you, Chalmers, that'll do.

185
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,323
Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum.

186
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,157
Uh, if I may, sir,

187
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,992
I believe I have skills and ideas

188
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,293
that go well beyond punching numbers

189
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,415
into an adding machine.

190
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,669
Well, I've read about this German fellow,
Lilienthal, I believe, who's developed

191
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,126
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.

192
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,085
Isn't that amazing?

193
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,462
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

194
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,343
- it would be revolutionary.
- Gentlemen!

195
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,182
Can I have your attention?

196
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,180
You're all dismissed.

197
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,845
Bankrupt?

198
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,264
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

199
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,225
Yes, at the bottom of the South China Sea.

200
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,818
Typhoon sank 'em all.

201
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,031
(indistinct murmuring)

202
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,333
(sighs)

203
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,409
(water dripping)

204
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,178
(children chattering)

205
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,187
(imitating gunfire)

206
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,105
(squealing, giggling)

207
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,564
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!

208
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,770
- Hey.
- Oh, God!

209
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,276
You're home early.

210
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,198
And until further notice.

211
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,329
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

212
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,748
Or any job, apparently.

213
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,750
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.

214
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,202
Charity.

215
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,049
This isn't the life I promised you.

216
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,552
But I have everything I want.

217
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,754
What about the magic?

218
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,930
What do you call those two girls?

219
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,805
(both laughing)

220
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,851
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.

221
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,809
Daddy!

222
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,390
- PHINEAS: Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

223
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,816
- A present for what?
- (laughing)

224
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,609
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

225
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,232
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

226
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,236
Okay, I do have a present...

227
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,734
but not just any present. Oh, no.

228
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,495
The most amazing birthday present ever.

229
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,207
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

230
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,831
by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago.

231
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,752
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

232
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,876
until just last week, on a stormy night,

233
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,049
when a sunken pirate ship washed up

234
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,797
on the shores of Nantucket.

235
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,174
They found skeletons and treasures

236
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,971
and the blueprints were recovered

237
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:15,099
by none other than J. W. Mercantile.

238
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,601
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly

239
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,556
but I managed to commit them to memory.

240
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,109
And if I have remembered correctly...

241
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,906
Happy birthday, Caroline.

242
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,374
This is a wishing machine.

243
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,205
You tell it your wishes...

244
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,175
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

245
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,800
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

246
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,589
Can I tell a wish?

247
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,140
Step right up. Go ahead.

248
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,471
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

249
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,476
(chuckles)
That is a good wish.

250
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,808
I wish...

251
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,652
for ballet slippers.

252
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,531
Hey, that's... that's a good wish, too.

253
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,996
What's your wish, Mommy?

254
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,956
I wish...

255
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,715
for happiness like this forever

256
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,792
for you and you...

257
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,674
and for your father.

258
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,048
Boring!

259
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,304
- (Phineas laughs)
- CHARITY (laughs): Boring?

260
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,556
Since when has happiness ever been boring?

- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

273
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,488
This bank only wants to lend money

274
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,739
to people with money.

275
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,204
What are you looking at, flop-doodle?

276
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,163
Mr. Barnum.

277
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,840
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

278
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,796
It's a good bet is what it is, sir.

279
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,381
People don't want to admit it...

280
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,092
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

281
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,393
It's why we stare at it.

282
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,183
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

283
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,067
Of course. I, uh...
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

284
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,271
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla of trading vessels.

285
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,364
CHARITY:
Why would a bank loan us $10,000?

286
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,990
Because we put up collateral.

287
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,538
But, dear, we don't have any collateral.

288
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,412
Sure we do. In the South China Seas.

289
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,788
CHARITY:
In the South China Seas?

290
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,336
Deep in the South China Seas. (laughs)

291
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,163
CHARITY:
And what did we buy with this loan?

292
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,635
"Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities."

293
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,302
What kind of museum is it?

294
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,134
(laughs)

295
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,682
A place to be transported.

296
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,179
A place where people can see things

297
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,226
they've never seen before.

298
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,685
Huh?

299
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,684
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,640
They're all the rage in Europe. Look.

301
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,192
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

302
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,736
Come here. See?

303
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,648
You've already met some
of the most famous folks in history.

304
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,194
But they're not all wax.

305
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,032
This is the great... O'Malley.

306
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,739
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

307
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,449
You don't look like a magician.

308
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,242
I'm a thief.

309
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,045
A very good thief.
I caught him nicking my watch.

- (spits)
- (coin clatters)

311
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,084
- See?
- An elephant!

312
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,210
PHINEAS:
Not just any elephant.

313
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,088
I can get you something real nice.
Just say the word.

314
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,258
CHARITY:
Oh. Thank you.

315
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,677
Oh, yeah. This is a ten-ton bull

316
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,675
straight from the plains of Africa.

317
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,132
- And look at that.
- (laughing)

318
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,263

<i>Ah, Mr. Bennett from the Herald.</i>

558
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,771
Come to take in another show, huh?

559
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,022
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

560
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,228
does it bother you

561
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,939
that everything you're selling is fake?

562
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,191
Do these smiles seem fake?

563
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,572
It doesn't matter where they come from.
The joy is real.

564
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,244
So, you are a philanthropist?

565
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,115
Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime.

566
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,205
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

567
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,708
The creed of a true fraud.

568
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,333
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

569
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,668
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?

570
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,846
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

571
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,758
Now who's a fraud?

572
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,353
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

573
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,394
That word you used to describe my show?

574
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,892
Has a nice ring to it.

575
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,617
- (giggling)
- And right this way.

576
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,120
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?

577
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,621
Well, isn't that what makes it fun?

578
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,079
Keep coming. Okay. Are you ready?

579
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,796
- CHARITY: Is it?
- PHINEAS: It is.

580
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,350
Come on. Let's go.

581
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,598
Push.

582
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,764
- Oh.
- Wow.

583
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,317
Helen, that's for you.

584
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,485
(gasps)

585
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,275
And, Caroline, this is for you.

586
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,034
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

587
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,915
Just past your parents' house, actually.

588
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,998
Don't tell me you bought this house

589
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,505
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

590
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,302
Well, that wasn't the only reason.

591
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,506
This is the life I promised you.

592
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,890
Shall we?

593
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,384
Phin...

594
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,970
it's beautiful,

595
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,600
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

596
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,432
- (laughs)
- PHINEAS: It only took me 25 years, but...

597
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,151
welcome home, Charity Barnum.

598
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,775
(classical music plays)

599
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,893

00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,976
- Hello, there.
- MAN: There goes Barnum.

602
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,569
PHINEAS: Hey, sweetheart,
who's that young man over there?

603
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,328
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

604
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,660
A bit of a scandal, they say.

605
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,828
His last play was a hit in London.

606
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,126
- Play?
- Mmm.

607
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,046
You pay good money to watch people
stand around and talk for two hours,

608
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,622
and they call me a con man.

609
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,834
Ew, what's that smell? Do you smell that?

610
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,136
Ew. Something does smell.

611
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,965
Oh, I know what it is. Peanuts.

612
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,720
(girls snickering)

613
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,309
I can see it right now.

614
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,735
"Youngest prima ballerina

615
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,403
in the history of the City Ballet."

616
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,490
I'm quitting.

617
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,783
What? Why would you quit?

618
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,910
I started too late. I'll never catch up.

619
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,909
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

620
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,291
What? You think I can't spot talent?

621
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,377
Ballet takes years of hard work.

622
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,588
It's not like the circus.

623
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,173
You can't just fake it.

624
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,840
She can't quit. No.
No, I mean, she just...

625
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,221
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

626
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,893
Well, I should certainly hope so.

627
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,936
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

628
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,355
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

629
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,774
in the world to her right now.

630
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,022
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.

631
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,569
She shouldn't have to.

632
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,567
New York society will never accept us.

633
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,364
If they did, they'd have to stop judging

634
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,192
and actually do something
with their lives.

635
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,493
This isn't about me.

636
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,778
Oh.

637
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,202
So it's different
than everything else then?

638
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,663
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

639
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,416
She is proud.

640
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,422
We don't have to be the Carlyles.

641
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,505
Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play?

642
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,716
Yes, I did indeed.

643
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,766
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

644
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,094
(chuckles)
P. T. Barnum.

645
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,686
From the circus?

646
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,309
Yes. You... you've been?

647
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,392
(chuckles) God, no.
But I have seen the crowds.

648
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,695
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in,

649
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,989
which is much more
than I can say for my play.

650
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,529
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.

651
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,036
That's because I'm selling virtue.

652
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,577
Can I buy you a drink?

653
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,003
I wanna go after the carriage trade.

654
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,500
Present legitimate acts,

655
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,458
expand our appeal, go after the snobs.

656
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,795
If you only knew how suffocating they are.

657
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,379
So come join the circus.

658
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,305
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

659
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,179
Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows.

660
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,228
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

661
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,140
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

662
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,021
Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?
(taps bar)

663
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,852
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

664
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,403
admiring your show from afar.

665
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,196
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

666
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,195
Do you understand that
just associating with you

667
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,991
could cost me my inheritance?

668
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,410
Oh, it could cost you more than that.

669
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,778
You'd be risking everything.

670
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,488
But, on the other hand, well,

671
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,912
you just might find yourself a free man.

in New York read him.

791
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,518
He does their thinking for them.

792
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,860
Whatever happened
to thriving off controversy?

793
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,276
Yeah, well... hey.

794
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,195
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- HELEN: Phillip!

795
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,572
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

796
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,778
- Helen, come on.
- (Helen giggles)

797
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:21,953
"The Master of the Household

798
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,827
"has it in command of the Queen

799
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,782
"to invite Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

800
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,209
"and his theatrical troupe

801
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,537
to a reception at Buckingham Palace."

802
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,591
The Queen Victoria? Is this real?

803
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,376
I had to pull a few strings.

804
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,802
If you want society to accept you,

805
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,879
you may as well start...

806
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,262
- at the very, very top.
- (giggles)

807
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,805
Are we all invited?

808
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,153
I guess I'll just have to tell the Queen

809
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,901
that either all of us go...

810
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:58,899
or none of us will.

811
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:01,656
(chuckles)

812
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,409
(cheering, laughing)

813
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,207
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

814
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,834
PHILLIP:
Why aren't we in tails?

815
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,009
PHINEAS:
We're the entertainment.

816
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,803
LETTIE:
Don't see you in a costume.

817
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,762
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum and his...

818
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,806
Oddities from America!

819
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,523
(indistinct murmuring)

820
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,854
WOMAN:
Is that... is that real?

821
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,867
(indistinct whispering,
murmuring)

822
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:54,122
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.

823
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,961
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

824
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,627
And I've heard all about

825
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,463
your little colonel
from my friends in America.

826
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,056
General, ma'am.

827
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,884
You're even smaller than I imagined.

828
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,309
Well, you're not exactly

829
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,103
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.

830
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,771
(crowd gasping)

831
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,149
(laughing)

832
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,819
(crowd laughing)

833
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:33,918
That went well.

834
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,962
(fanfare playing)

835
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,459
STEWARD:
Your Majesty.

836
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,669
PHINEAS:
Phillip.

837
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,001
Miss Jenny Lind.

838
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,049
WOMAN:
She is luminous.

839
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,093
Who's that?

840
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,224
PHILLIP:
The opera singer?

841
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,685
Singer, huh?

842
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,318
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

843
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,029
She's sold out La Scala a dozen times.

844
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,649
Not to mention the French Opera.

845
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,704
Ah.

846
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,290
- What are you doing?
- Following you,

847
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,493
- so you can introduce me to Miss Lind.
- PHILLIP: Introduce you?

848
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,998
- PHINEAS: Yeah.
- PHILLIP: I don't know her.

849
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,670
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

850
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,749
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

851
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,208
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.

852
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,918
(Phineas clears throat)

853
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,636
Miss Lind.

854
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,093
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

855
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,394
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

856
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,562
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

857
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,147
The pleasure's mine.

858
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,520
Of course, you are the American.

859
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,317
I believe I might have heard of you.

860
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,608
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here,

861
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,984
I must be doing something right.

862
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,574
That, or something very wrong.

863
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,657
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

864
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,493
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

865
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,784
A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman.

866
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,961
The best on my side of the Atlantic.

867
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,958
Well, if you do say so yourself.

868
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,174
I do, but I don't have to.

869
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,126
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

870
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,133
No, he is one of the best.

871
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,180
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...

872
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,383
let me get to the point.

873
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,933
I'd like to bring you to New York.

874
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,102
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

875
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,100
not in Europe, but in the entire world.

876
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,226
Mmm.

877
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,725
And have you heard me sing?

878
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,068
- Absolutely.
- No. No, I haven't.

879
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,439
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,

880
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,399
and, well, I trust your reputation

881
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,950
more than my own taste, so...

882
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,323
I've never been to America.

883
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,247
You will sing in the grandest theater

884
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,575
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

885
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:37,914
"Jenny Lind.

886
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,829
"One night only."

887
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,129
- (laughs)
- Or maybe two.

888
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,673
And at 20 percent of the gate,

889
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,295
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.

890
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,632
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

891
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:48,963
To orphans and widows.

892
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,514
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

893
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,183
That's brilliant. I mean,
the press will go crazy for that story.

894
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,681
That's not a story.

895
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,728
May I ask you something, Mr. Barnum?

896
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,726
Anything.

897
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,520
Why me?

898
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,521
People come to my show

899
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,946
for the pleasure of being hoodwinked.

900
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,446
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

901
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,283
MAN:
Miss Lind.

902
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,014
Everyone is here. Look at this.

903
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,762
Even the Winthrops.

904
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,885
Are you happy?

905
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,479
I will be if this works.

906
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,978
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

907
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,194
PHINEAS:
What's taking her so long?

908
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,862
They're still taking their seats.

909
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,234
- Speaking of which.
- Yeah?

910
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,112
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

911
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,409
- What?
- (audience murmuring)

912
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,327
Where should I put 'em? Your box?

913
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,450
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.

914
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,623
- Visible?
- The acoustics are actually better

915
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,371
in the standing room.
That's where they should be.

916
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,040
Miss Lind's ready now.

917
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,462
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

918
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,174
This is so awesome.

919
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,502
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

920
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,212
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

921
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,428
(conductor tapping baton)

922
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,106
(audience quiets)

923
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,895
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

924
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,984
MAN:
He's out of his element.

925
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,656
MAN 2:
What is this about?

926
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,358
MAN 3:
Is that Barnum?

927
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,659
WOMAN:
This isn't the circus.

928
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,578
I recently had the privilege

929
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,249
of hearing the most divine voice

930
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,416
I've ever heard.

931
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,914
Suddenly, he's a connoisseur.

932
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,963
PHINEAS: Now, I know that sounds
like Barnum humbug...

933
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,799
but I have 100 bottles
of good champagne on ice

934
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,218
that says this isn't just
another sideshow novelty.

935
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:55,012
(audience titters)

936
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,590
May I present...

937
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,391
the Swedish Nightingale...

938
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,761
Miss Jenny Lind.

939
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,393

Brava!

992

Brava!

993
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:54,952
More!

994
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,254
MAN 2:
Wonderful!

995
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,415
Bravissima!

996
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,379

00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,474
Encore!

1000
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,143
(applause continues)

1001

(pops)

1002
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,597
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

1003
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,684
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!

1004
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,894
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

1005
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,070
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

1006
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,897
Are you?

1007
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,948
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

1008
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,571
And what about you, Helen?

1009
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,119
You look like a princess, ma'am.

1010
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,241
(all laugh)

1011
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,496
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.

1012
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,415
Enough to bring joy
to the most joyless critic, isn't she?

1013
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,003
Mmm. And in the hands
of a real purveyor of the arts,

1014
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,505
- she could be something in this country.
- (laughs)

1015
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,424
Shame, she's fallen in with you.

1016
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,301
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

1017
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,598
hard as that is to believe.

1018
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,175
WOMAN:
Mr. Barnum, I'd love to meet Miss Lind.

1019
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,602
- PHINEAS: And you will meet Miss Lind.
- WOMAN: Would you introduce us?

1020
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,145
- If you just give me a moment...
- Phineas.

1021
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,187
Yes.

1022
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,391
You've... done well.

1023
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,481
Thank you.

1024
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,907
Allow me to introduce you.

1025
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,411
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

1026
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,739
I'd like you to meet Charity's parents.

1027
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,616
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

1028
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,575
Ah, pleasure.

1029
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,535
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1030
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,171
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

1031
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,336
- (clears throat)
- MRS. HALLETT: Are these...

1032
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,880
Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters.

1033
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,257
- Phineas, not here.
- Not here?

1034
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,054
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents

1035
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,473
in front of their fancy friends?

1036
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,516
I... I really don't think
I have that power.

1037
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,890
An insignificant man like me

1038
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,018
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

1039
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,186
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

1040
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,274
Get out.

1041
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,569
Well, Phineas...

1042
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,622
I believe I told you that free champagne

1043
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,119
is a recipe for disaster.

1044
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,330
- Charity.
- Now would everyone please

1045
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,128
- raise their glasses?
- PHINEAS: Charity.

1046
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,548
To Mr. Barnum,

1047
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,296
who has shown once and for all

1048
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,048
that a man's station is limited only

1049
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,629
by his imagination.

1050
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,926
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

1051
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:14,975
To Mr. Barnum.

1052
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,347
Thank you.

1053
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,025
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege

1054
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,272
when you're born into it.

1055
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,987
(chuckles)

1056
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,820
(whispers)
I sometimes don't feel like I belong here.

1057
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,527
You?

1058
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,289
I was born out of wedlock...

1059
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,871
and that brought shame upon my family.

1060
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,957
And life always manages to remind me

1061
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,629
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

1062
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,834
And that... leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

1063
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,546
(boisterous laughter)

1064
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,098
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

1065
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,801
Lord, that lady can sing!

1066
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,931
I know.

1067
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,637
Think she likes a man in uniform?

1068
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,643
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

1069
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,940
You got a show in an hour, okay?

1070
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,143
That's enough time for us
to have at least three drinks, right?

1071
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,024
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, no. Lettie!

1072
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,855
- What?
- It's very crowded in here, okay?

1073
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,157
And I can't have you mingling... guys!

1074
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,194
Who's gonna pay admission if you're
out there for all the world to see?

1075
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,699
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

1076
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,322
- (glass chimes)
- PHINEAS: Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

1077
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,454
Jenny, America may not know it yet...

1078
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,244
but they are going to love you.

1079

PHILLIP: Why can't you just put
more shows in New York?

1160
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,068
Why do you need to tour the country?

1161
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,690
Why did Napoleon march on Russia?

1162
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:19,693
Napoleon was defeated.

1163
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,615
Napoleon didn't have a 60-piece orchestra.

1164
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,617
A 60-piece orchestra?

1165
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,945
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

1166
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,075
We'll still have to board them.

1167
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,656
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

1168
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,457
O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank.

1169
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,910
- PHILLIP: Custom sets?
- PHINEAS: Yeah.

1170
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,289
- PHILLIP: Fireworks?
- PHINEAS: Uh-huh.

1171
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,336
Inside theaters?

1172
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,004
That's genius.

1173
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,627
No. Hey, P. T.

1174
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,379
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

1175
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,335
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

1176
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,294
Yeah. I took out a loan.

1177
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,257
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

1178
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,932
You're not gonna see a penny of profit

1179
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,304
until your 40th show...

1180
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,351
41st, actually.

1181
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,186
You're risking everything
you've built here.

1182
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,354
How do you think I built it?

1183
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,181
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

1184
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,392
- P. T.?
- What?

1185
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,442
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

1186
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,736
Our gate is down,

1187
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,233
we have more protesters every day.

1188
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,734
You just need to get people to come back.

1189
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,566
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

1190
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,071
you haven't been at the Barnum Museum."

1191
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,323
They come to see you.

1192
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,280
Your crazy ideas...

1193
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,157
your new acts, the unusual.

1194
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,868
Well, then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

1195
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,328
Keep rehearsing. Just make it very clear

1196
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,789
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

1197
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,590
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.

1198
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,919
LETTIE:
Aingt that a sight for sore eyes?

1199
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,629
(scoffs)
Couldn't even say "hello."

1200
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,760
Or "goodbye." He's going on tour.

1201
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,013
- Sorry, guys.
- Oh, pull yourself together, Carlyle.

1202
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,469
Don't you have somewhere to be?

1203
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,313
- (Tom chuckles)
- (quick footsteps)

1204
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,517
(orchestra tuning)

1205
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,820
Anne Wheeler.
Mr. Barnum said he left a ticket for me.

1206
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,232
(clears throat)

1207
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,243
I'm... I'm sorry.

1208
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,036
I... I believe there's
only supposed to be one.

1209
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,613
No, there's meant to be two.

1210
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,037
I wasn't sure you'd come if I asked.

1211
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,252
MAN:
Five minutes to curtain.

1212
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:06,053
- (indistinct chatter)
- (bell dinging)

1213
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,260
I've always wanted to go to the theater.

1214
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,690
MR. CARLYLE:
Phillip, is that you?

1215
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,151
Mother. Father.

1216
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,650
This is Anne Wheeler.

1217
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,198
Phillip...

1218
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,568
have you no shame?

1219
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,616
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

1220
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,323
but parading around with the help?

1221
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,126
Anne.

1222
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,296
Anne! Anne!

1223
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,966
(door closes)

1224
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,012
How dare you speak to her like that.

1225
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,592
You forget your place, Phillip.

1226
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,848
My place?

1227
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,437
Mother, if this is my place...

1228
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,185
then I don't want any part of it.

1229
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:10,367
Anne.

1230
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,824
They're small-minded people.

1231
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,174
Why do you care what they think?

1232
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,842
It's not just them.

1233
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,262
You've never had somebody look at you

1234
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,714
the way your parents looked at me.

1235
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,806

First, it was buying a house
on the same street as my parents.

1296
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:37,884
Then, meeting the Queen.

1297
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,172
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.

1298
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,640
When will it ever be enough for you?

1299
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,094
I'm doing this for Caroline and Helen.

Look around you. They have everything.

1301
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,977
- You don't understand.

No, you don't understand.

How could you?

1304
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,073
My father was treated like dirt.

1305
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,159
I was treated like dirt...

1306
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,907
and my children will not be.

1307

01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,584
And your spooks.

1419
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,041
PHILLIP: Sir.

1420
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,761
I will only ask once more.

1421
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,463
Then what, boy?

1422
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,765
Hey! Stop!

1423
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:23,933
Get him!

1424
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,352
Charge!

1425
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,934
(indistinct yelling)

1426
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,779
- (men grunting)
- (glass shatters)

1427
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,294
(train whistle blows)

1428
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,009
- WOMAN: Could that be her?
- MAN: I think so.

1429
01:15:58,804 --> 01:15:59,760
GIRLS:
Daddy!

1430
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,679
- (Phineas laughs)
- Daddy!

1431
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,808
- Girls, girls, girls!
- Daddy!

1432
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,307
Oh, you've grown so much. Stop it.

1433
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,731
What made you decide to come back early?

1434
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,774
I missed you. I missed you.

1435
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,944
- That sounds an awful lot like humbug.
- (bell ringing)

1436
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,272
- Fire!
- Move aside! Move aside!

1437
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,153
- Come on!
- Hurry! It's coming from the circus.

1438
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,656
MAN:
Run! Let's go! Fire!

1439
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,453
Girls, stay with me. Come. Quick, quick!

1440
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,705
Everyone, stay close!

1441
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:35,664
(screaming)

1442
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,218
Phillip! Is everyone out?

1443
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,012
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

1444
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,260
The animals? The animals?

1445
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,012
Yeah, we set them free.
What else could we do?

1446
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,309
W. D., where's Anne?

1447
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:48,555
PHINEAS:
Where's Anne? Where's Anne?

1448
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,892
No, Phillip! No!

1449
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,940
- Hey, hey! Outside!
- You can't go in there!

1450
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,109
- Anne!
- Phillip!

1451
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:59,480
Keep pumping! Keep pumping!

1452
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,781
- W. D.!
- Here she is! Here she is!

1453
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,859
Anne! Oh my God!

1454
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,073
PHINEAS:

1455
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,495
- Phillip!
- Daddy!

1456
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,667
- No, Daddy!
- Daddy!

1457
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,619
- Daddy!
- (crowd screaming)

1458

01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,938

FIREMAN:
Stretcher!

1465
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,323
Stretcher!

1466
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,742
He's taken a lot of smoke.

1467
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,077
He's still breathing. Come on.

1468
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,621
- (coughing)
- FIREMAN 2: Come on, let's get him on!

1469
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,083
Up!

1470
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,431

Come on! Straight ahead!

If you've come to gloat, I wouldn't.

1481
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,276
They caught the thugs
who started the fire.

1482
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,612
I thought you'd like to know.

1483
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,994
(sighs, clears throat)

1484
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,416
I never liked your show.

1485
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,578
But I always thought the people did.

1486
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,880
They did. They do.

1487
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,136
(scoffs)

1488
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,428
Mind you, I wouldn't call it art.

1489
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:16,551
Of course not.

1490
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,219
But...

1491
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:23,312
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

1492
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,695
all colors... shapes, sizes...

1493
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,489
presenting them as equals...

1494
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,448
Why, another critic
might have even called it...

1495
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,871
"a celebration of humanity."

1496
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:40,159
I would've liked that.

1497
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,667
Mmm.

1498
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,169
- Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
- Hmm.

1499
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,418
I mean, thank God for Jenny's tour.

1500
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,219
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.

1501
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,846
You don't know?

1502
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:54,888
Hmm?

1503
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,019
- (gasps)
- I'm sorry.

1504
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,490
Charity?

1505
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,036
Oh, God, Charity.

1506
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:19,914
- I am...
- I don't wanna talk to you.

1507
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,366
N... nothing happened. This is ridiculous.

1508
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,496
Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

1509
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,119
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.

1510
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,626
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

1511
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:27,671
Of course you're not.

1512
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,425
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

1513
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,843
Just you and your show.

1514
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,096
(scoffs) What are you doing?

1515
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:38,929
I'm going home.

1516
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,810
This is your home.

1517
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:45,686
The bank...

1518
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,481
they're evicting us.

1519
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,694
Why didn't you ask me before...

1520
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,410
I would've said yes.

1521
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,746
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1522
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,460
(door slams)

1523
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,269
(Tom groans)

1524
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,034
(sighs)

1525
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,491
Figured you'd end up here.

1526
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,165
- Feeling sorry for yourself.
- (door opens)

1527
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,716
Folks, if you've come to get paid,

1528
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,142
the money is gone. All of it.

1529
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,346
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

1530
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,476
You just don't get it.

1531
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,191
Our own mothers were ashamed of us.

1532
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,941
Hid us our whole lives.

1533
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,358
Then you pull us out of the shadows.

1534
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,202
And now you're giving up on us, too.

1535
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,080
Maybe you are a fraud.

1536
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,166
Maybe it was just about making a buck.

1537
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,622
But you gave us a real family.

1538
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,876
And the circus... that was our home.

1539
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,423
We want our home back.
