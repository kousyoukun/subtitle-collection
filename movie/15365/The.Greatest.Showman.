机会就在铁轨上等着你  先生
Opportunity awaits you sir, out on the rails.

157
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,280
先生  我知道我出身贫寒
Sir I, I know I don't come from much

158
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,260
但我会照顾好你女儿
but I will take care of your daughter

159
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,630
给她跟这一样好的生活
and I will give her a life as grand as this one.

160
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,080
再见  妈妈
Bye, mother.

161
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,110
她会回来的
She'll be back.

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,000
她迟早会厌倦你那一贫如洗的生活
Sooner or later she will get tired of your life of having nothing

163
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,150
到时她就会回来
and she'll come running back home.

164
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,610
每晚当我躺在床上
Ev'ry night I lie in bed

165
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,880
脑海中会浮现最缤纷的色彩
The brightest colors fill my head

166
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:41,070
千万个梦想让我无法入眠
A million dreams are keepin' me awake

167
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,610
我想象世界可能变成的样子
I think of what the world could be

168
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,820
我愿景中那美丽的样子
A vision of the one I see

169
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,160
千万个梦想便能实现愿望
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

170
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,260
用千万个梦想构建我们要打造的世界
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

171
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,510
不管宏大  还是渺小
However big, however small

172
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,260
都让我参与其中
Let me be a part of it all

173
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,970
与你分享梦想
Share your dreams with me

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,450
无论成功  或是失败
You may be right, you may be wrong

175
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,210
但求你带我同行
But say that you'll bring me along

176
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,550
去你眼中的世界
To the world you see

177
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,820
去我梦想中的世界
To the world I close my eyes to see

178
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,570
我梦想中的世界
I close my eyes to see

179
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,570
因为每晚当我躺在床上
'Cause ev'ry night I lie in bed

180
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,780
脑海中会浮现最缤纷的色彩
The brightest colors fill my head

181
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,330
千万个梦想让我无法入眠
A million dreams are keepin' me awake

182
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,560
千万个梦想  千万个梦想
A million dreams, a million dreams

183
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,710
我想象世界可能变成的样子
I think of what the world could be

184
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,960
我愿景中那美丽的样子
A vision of the one I see

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,410
千万个梦想便能实现愿望
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

186
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:07,420
用千万个梦想构建我们要打造的世界
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

187
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,180
我们要打造的世界
For the world we're gonna make

188
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,210
-史密斯先生  -嗯
- Mr. Smith? - Yes.

189
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,800
-看看这个  -是
- Have a look at this? - Of course.

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,730
好  我知道了
Yes, yes, I see it.

191
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,100
谢谢  查默斯  这就行了
Thank you, Chalmers, that'll do.

192
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,580
先生  我是菲尼斯·泰勒·巴纳姆
Sir. Phineas Taylor Barnum.

193
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,190
恕我冒昧  先生
If I may sir,

194
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,070
我认为凭我的技能和才思
I believe I have skills and ideas...

195
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,470
能做比往加法机里输入数字更重要的工作
that go well beyond punching numbers into an adding machine.

196
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,570
我读到有个德国人  利林塔尔
Well, I've read about this German fellow, Lilienthal...

197
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,250
他研制了一种滑翔机
I believe who's developed a glider

198
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,200
能够载人上天  先生
that can take a man in the air, sir.

199
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,490
那多了不起啊
Isn't that amazing?

200
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,620
如果把这种技术用在这一行里
I mean, if you were to apply that to this business,

201
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,790
那将是革命性的
it would be revolutionary.

202
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,310
先生们  请注意
Gentlemen. Can I have your attention?

203
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,240
你们都被解雇了
You're all dismissed.

204
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,170
破产了
Bankrupt?

205
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,150
公司不还有十几艘商船呢吗
I thought the company had a dozen trading ships.

206
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,630
是啊  葬身中国南海海底了
Yes, at the bottom of the South China Seas.

207
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,050
被台风吹沉了
Typhoon sank 'em all.

208
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,900
-抓到你了  -你等着瞧吧
- Tag, you're it! - Oh, you're in for it.

209
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,680
天呐  你回来得可真早
Oh God. You are home early.

210
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,510
而且有新消息之前都不用回去了
And until further notice.

211
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,480
我本就觉得那工作不适合你一直做下去
Well, I didn't think you were long for that job

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,900
看来我什么工作都做不下去
Or any job apparently.

213
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,770
所以我们的生活才那么精彩嘛
That's what makes our life together so exciting.

214
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,090
夏瑞蒂
Charity.

215
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,200
这不是我许诺给你的生活
This isn't the life I promised you.

216
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,520
但我已经有了我想要的一切
But I have everything I want.

217
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,950
-我说的魔法呢  -那俩姑娘不是吗
- What about the magic? - What do you call those two girls?

218
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,450
伙计们  看看是谁回来了
Hey, you partners, look who moseyed into the corral.

219
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,700
爸爸
Daddy!

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,190
-过来  -你带礼物来了吗
- Come here. - Did you bring a present?

221
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,540
什么礼物
A present, for what?

222
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,550
-我生日的礼物  -什么
- For my birthday. - Your what?

223
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,680
-我生日  -才不是你生日呢
- My birthday. - It's not your birthday.

224
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,410
好吧  我是有件礼物
Okay, I do have a present.

225
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,910
但可不是一般的礼物哦
But not just any present. Oh no.

226
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,680
是史上最棒的生日礼物
The most amazing birthday present ever.

227
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,000
这台了不起的机器原本是
This extraordinary machine was originally

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
四百年由莱昂纳多·达·芬奇制造的
created by Leonardo Da Vinci 400 years ago.

229
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,940
但它的图纸已经遗失数百年
But the blueprints had been lost for centuries,

230
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,060
直到上周  一个风雨交加的夜晚
until just last week, on a stormy night...

231
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,020
一艘沉没海盗船的残骸冲上了楠塔基特岛的海岸
when a sunken pirate ship washed up on the shores of Nantucket.

232
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,180
人们发现了骸骨和宝藏
They found skeletons and treasures...

233
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,050
而图纸正好
and the blueprints were recovered

234
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,310
被JW商社找回
by none other than JW Mercantile.

235
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,570
图纸只在我手上停留了片刻
The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly...

236
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,780
但我还是把它记了下来
but I managed to commit them to memory...

237
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,990
如果我没有记错
and if I have remembered correctly...

238
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,960
生日快乐  卡罗琳
Happy birthday, Caroline.

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,510
这是一台许愿机  你向它许愿
This is a wishing machine. You tell it your wishes...

240
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,490
它会替你守护愿望  直到它成真
and it keeps them safe until they come true.

241
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,980
就算你忘记了  它也永远记得
Even if you forget them, they're always there.

242
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,550
我能许个愿吗
Can I tell a wish?

243
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,260
过来  说吧
Step right up. Go ahead.

244
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,800
我希望...嫁给圣诞老人
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

245
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,720
真是个好愿望
That is a good wish.

246
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,500
我希望...有一双芭蕾舞鞋
I wish for ballet slippers.

247
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,640
这个愿望也很好
Hey, that's a good wish too.

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,050
你的愿望呢  妈妈
What is your wish, Mommy?

249
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,960
我希望
I wish...

250
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,790
永远这么幸福
for happiness like this forever.

251
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,970
你  还有你
For you and you...

252
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,830
还有你们爸爸都是
and for your father.

253
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,920
-没劲  -没劲
- Boring. - Boring?

254
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,780
幸福怎么没劲了
Since when has happiness ever been boring?

255
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,070
每晚当我躺在床上
Ev'ry night I lie in bed

256
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,310
脑海中会浮现最缤纷的色彩
The brightest colors fill my head

257
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,820
千万个梦想让我无法入眠
A million dreams are keepin' me awake

258
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,300
我想象世界可能变成的样子
I think of what the world could be

259
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,540
我愿景中那美丽的样子
A vision of the one I see

260
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,890
千万个梦想便能实现愿望
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

261
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,250
用千万个梦想构建我们要打造的世界
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

262
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,050
羊肉价格涨了  猪胸肉就降价了
The goat prices go up, so the pork bellies go down.

263
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,840
查尔斯  我们走
Charles, we're leaving.

264
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,770
这家银行只想借钱给有钱的人
This bank only wants to lend money to people with money.

265
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,510
你看什么  蠢蛋
What are you looking at flop-doodle?

266
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,080
巴纳姆先生
Mr. Barnum.

267
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,930
你提出的这项投资很有风险  还有些怪异
This venture you propose is risky and somewhat bizarre.

268
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,820
这是十拿九稳的好买卖  先生
It's a good bet, it's what it is, sir.

269
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,280
人们不愿承认
People don't want to admit it...

270
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,280
但他们被新奇骇人的东西所吸引
but they are fascinated with the exotic and the macabre.

271
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,620
所以我们喜欢盯着它们看
It's why we stare at it.

272
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,470
银行需要高价的抵押品
The bank is going to need substantial collateral.

273
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,990
当然  那是应当的
Of course. I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

274
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,500
这是我商船队的契据和所有权证明
The deed and title to my entire flotilla of trading vessels.

275
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,530
银行凭什么要借我们一万美元
Why would a bank loan us 10,000 dollars?

276
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,120
因为我们拿出了抵押品
Because we put up collateral.

277
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,470
但亲爱的  我们没有抵押品啊
But, dear, we don't have any collateral.

278
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,490
当然有  在中国南海
Sure we do. In the South China Seas.

279
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,950
-在中国南海  -在中国南海海底
- In the South China Seas? - Deep in the South China Seas.

280
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,260
我们用这笔借款买了什么
And what did we buy with this loan?

281
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,500
巴纳姆美国珍奇博物馆
Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities.

282
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,180
这是什么样的博物馆
What kind of museum is it?

283
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,890
这里犹如一个异世界
A place to be transported.

284
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,620
让人们见识到他们从未见识过的东西
A place where people can see things they've never seen before.

285
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,730
-蜡像吗  -是啊
- Wax figures? - Yeah. Yeah.

286
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,670
这现在在欧洲最火了  看啊
They're all the rage in Europe. Look.

287
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,440
喉咙疼的玛丽·安托瓦内特
Marie Antoinette with the sore throat.

288
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,000
拿破仑  过来  看
Napoleon. Come here. See?

289
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,930
你能见到一些历史上赫赫有名的人物
You've already met some of the most famous folks in history.

290
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,390
但也不都是蜡像

你想让人嘲笑我
You want people to laugh at me.

Well, they're laughing anyway, kid. So, might as well get paid.

352
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,450
我能想象一位士兵  不  将军
I see a soldier. No, a general...

353
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,560
持着剑和枪  骑马飞驰过舞台
riding across the stage with a sword and a gun and...

354
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,920
他穿着最精美的军服

世界各地的人们会前来
People will come from all over the world

356
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,170
他们看到他时  不会发出嘲笑
and when they see him they won't laugh.

357
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,340
而是会致敬

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,400
先生
Sir,

372
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,140
请放过我吧
please leave me alone.

373
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,030
他们现在不理解  但将来会懂的
They don't understand, but they will.

374
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,390
这些人真是...
This line is so...

375
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,810
老天呀
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.

You know, people aren't gonna like it if you put us on the stage.

382
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,470
那最好了

有具体的数字吗
Do you have a number for that?

389

-我不太想说  但是  -就你知我知

见到你很高兴  先生

你过得浑浑噩噩
You stumble through your days

404
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,640
脑袋低垂
Got your head hung low

405
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,800
天空也是一片阴霾
Your sky's a shade of gray

406
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,690
好像糊里糊涂的僵尸
Like a zombie in a maze

407
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,810
请来两张
Two, please.

408
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,900
你的内心在沉睡
You're asleep inside

409
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,540
但你可以振作清醒
But you can shake awake

410
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,500
因为你犹如行尸走肉
'Cause you're just a dead man walkin'

411
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,620
还以为那是生活唯一的选择
Thinkin' that's your only option

412
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,580
但你可以打开开关  点亮你最晦暗的日子
But you can flick the switch and brighten up your darkest day

413
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,660
高悬的太阳刺得你睁不开眼睛
Sun is up and the color's blindin'

414
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,590
重新定义一个崭新的世界
Take a world and redefine it

415
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,420
只要抛开你狭隘的思维
Leave behind your narrow mind

416
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,760
你就能焕然一新
You'll never be the same

417
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,550
清醒过来  活跃起来
Come alive, come alive

418
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,820
点亮你的光芒
Go and light your light

419
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,900
让它发出炫目的光
Let it burn so bright

420
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,540
勇敢向上
Reachin' up

421
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,600
触及天空
To the sky

422
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,010
那里一片开阔
And it's open wide

423
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,270
你也活力四射
You're electrified

424
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
世界变成了幻想驰骋的地方
And the world becomes a fantasy

425
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,510
你也超越了自己的一切极限
And you're more than you could ever be

426
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,690
那是因为这是一场白日梦
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open

427
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,660
你清楚自己无法回到过去
And you know, you can't go back again

428
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
回到你曾经生活的世界
To the world that you were livin' in

429
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,850
因为这是一场盛大的白日梦
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open

430
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,910
鲜活起来吧
So, come alive

431
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,400
-莱蒂  他们在等着呢  -等什么
- Lettie! Lettie! They're waiting! - For what?

432
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,950
-等你  -不
- For you. - No.

433
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,200
他们现在还不知道
They don't know it yet,

434
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,310
但他们会爱上你的
but they are gonna love you.

435
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,180
相信我
Trust me.

436
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,150
汤姆
Tom.

437
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,920
上去
Up, up.

438
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,530
你的眼神告诉我
I see it in your eyes

439
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,530
你相信了那个谎言
You believe that lie

440
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,550
说你要藏起自己的真面目
That you need to hide your face

441
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,590
不敢走出家门
Afraid to step outside

442
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,710
于是你把自己锁了起来
So you lock the door

443
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,180
但你绝不能一直如此
But don't you stay that way

444
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,290
再也不用活在阴影中
No more livin' in those shadows

445
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,460
你和我  清楚那是怎样的生活
You and me, we know how that goes

446
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,650
因为一旦你见识到了  你必将焕发新生
'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

447
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,410
天上打下一道闪电
A little bit of lightnin' strikin'

448
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,390
把它存起来  继续闪耀
Bottled up to keep on shinin'

449
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,110
你可以证明自己还有更多精彩
You can prove there's more to you

450
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,620
不要害怕
You cannot be afraid

451
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,570
清醒过来  活跃起来
Come alive, come alive

452
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,650
点亮你的光芒
Go and light your light

453
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,680
让它发出炫目的光
Let it burn so bright

454
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,640
勇敢向上
Reachin' up

455
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,680
触及天空
To the sky

456
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,750
那里一片开阔
And it's open wide

457
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,280
你也活力四射
You're electrified

458
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,330
世界变成了幻想驰骋的地方
And the world becomes a fantasy

459
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,340
你也超越了自己的一切极限
And you're more than you could ever be

460
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,430
那是因为这是一场白日梦
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open

461
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,440
我们清楚自己不能回到过去
And we know, we can't go back again

462
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,450
回到我们曾经生活的世界
To the world that we were living in

463
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,620
因为这是一场盛大的白日梦
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open

464
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,820
鲜活起来吧
So, come alive

465
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,870
精彩
Bravo.

466

-再来  -太好了
- More! - Fantastic.

468
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,020
这可不妙
This is bad.

469
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,330
"罪犯"  "可耻"
"Criminal." "Degrading".

470
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,690
"马戏团"  这词我喜欢
"A circus." I like circus.

471
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,190
没错  胖小子
That's right, fat boy!

472
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,230
你要保护那胡子女人吗
You gonna protect that bearded lady?

473
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,530
-够了  -怪物

474
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,940
沃特

475
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,250
-进去  都进去  -看他们跑了
- Inside, all of you! Right now. - Look at 'em run.

476
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,050
-我们不欢迎你们这种人  -滚吧
- We don't want your kind. - Get outta here.

477
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,640
没错  你们这些怪物
That's right, you freaks.

478
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,250
你们的主子叫你们了
Your master's calling.

479
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,500
够了  先生
That's quite enough, sir.

480
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,270
没什么可看的了
Nothing more to look at.

481
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,940
不客气
At your service.

世界变成了幻想驰骋的地方
And the world becomes a fantasy

497
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,080
你也超越了自己的一切极限
And you're more than you could ever be

498
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,250
那是因为这是一场白日梦
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open

499
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,210
我们清楚自己不能回到过去

500
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,190
回到我们曾经生活的世界

501
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,590
因为这是一场盛大的白日梦
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open

502
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,310
世界变成了幻想驰骋的地方
And the world becomes a fantasy

503
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,300
你也超越了自己的一切极限
And you're more than you could ever be

504
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,460
那是因为这是一场白日梦
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open

505
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,470
我们清楚自己不能回到过去
And we know, we can't be go back again

506
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,350
回到我们曾经生活的世界

507
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,650
因为这是一场盛大的白日梦
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open

508
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,740
因为这是一场盛大的白日梦
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open

509
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,520
鲜活起来吧
So come alive

510
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,230
鲜活起来
Come alive

511
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,760
花生  来买花生啊
Peanuts. Get your peanuts here.

512
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,240
热腾腾的咸花生
Hot, salted peanuts. Piping hot!

513
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,670
我要一份  再给这位女士一份
One for me, one for the lady.

514
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,760
奥马利
O'Malley.

515
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,880
《先驱报》的班内特先生啊
Mr. Bennett from the Herald.

516
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,530
又来看表演了吗
Come to take in another show, huh?

517
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,100
告诉我  巴纳姆先生
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

518
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,090
你就不介意你卖的东西都是假的吗
does it bother you that everything you're selling is fake?

519
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,410
这些微笑是假的吗
Do these smiles seem fake?

520
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,620
不管是怎么来的  这份欢乐都是真的
It doesn't matter where they come from. The joy is real.

521
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,490
那么你还是慈善家了
So you are a philanthropist?

522
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,310
夸大其词又不是最严重的罪行
Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime.

523
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,570
想象力匮乏比太丰富更能让人痛苦
Men suffer more from imagining too little than too much.

524
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,890
大骗子的信条啊
The creed of a true fraud.

525
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,370
班内特先生  你上次笑是什么时候了
Mr Bennett, when was the last time you smiled?

526
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,520
或是好好大笑出来
Or had a good laugh? Like a real laugh?

527
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,070
在剧院里感受不到欢乐的剧评人
A theater critic who can't find joy in the theater.

528
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,840
谁才是骗子啊
Now who's a fraud?

529
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,570
班内特先生
Mr. Bennett.

530
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,420
你用来描述我表演的词
That word you used to describe my show,

531
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,360
叫起来挺上口
has a nice ring to it.

532
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,680
这边来
And right this way.

533
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,210
你不觉得我这辈子盲目信任得够多了吗
Don't you think there is enough 'blind trust' in my life?

534
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,750
这样不才好玩吗
Well, isn't that what makes it fun?

535
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,740
继续走
Keep coming.

536
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,810
好了
Okay.

537
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,390
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

538
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,210
-这是...  -没错
- Is it? - It is.

539
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,480
走吧  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

540
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,220
推
Push.

541
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,620
海伦  那是给你的
Helen, that's for you.

542
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,400
卡罗琳  这是给你的
And, Caroline, this is for you.

543
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,070
街那头就有一家芭蕾舞学校
There is a ballet school right down the street.

544
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,990
在刚过你父母家的地方
Just past your parents' house, actually.

545
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,060
别告诉我你买下这栋房子
Don't tell me you bought this house

546
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,550
就是为了向我父母炫耀你的成功
just to rub my parents' noses in your success.

547
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,110
不是只为了这个
Well, that wasn't the only reason.

548
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,710
这是我许诺给你的生活
This is the life I promised you.

549
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,770
我们来吧
Shall we?

550
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,700
菲尼
Phin...

551
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,710
这很美  但我们不需要这么奢侈的
It's beautiful, but you know, we don't need all of this to be--

552
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,830
虽然花了我25年的时间
It only took me 25 years, but...

553
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,300
欢迎回家  夏瑞蒂·巴纳姆
Welcome home, Charity Barnum.

554
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,050
-你好  -巴纳姆来了

555
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,810
亲爱的  那个年轻人是谁
Hey, sweetheart, who's that young man over there?

556
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,740
那是菲利普·卡莱尔  据说挺风流的
That's Phillip Carlyle. A bit of a scandal, they say.

557
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,730
-他的上部戏剧在伦敦大获成功  -戏剧
- His last play was a hit in London. - Play?

558
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,090
花大钱
You pay good money

559
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,020
去看人傻站着念叨两小时
watch people stand around and talk for two hours,

560
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,590
他们还说我是骗子
and they call me a con man.

561
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,830
什么味儿啊  你们闻到了吗
What's that smell? Do you smell that?

562
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,120
是啊  是有股味儿
Ew, something does smell.

563

565
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,250
我现在就能想象得到

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,370
"市芭蕾舞团史上最年轻的芭蕾舞演员"
"Youngest prima ballerina in the history of the City Ballet."

567
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,050
-我不想跳了  -什么  为什么不跳了
- I'm quitting. - What? Why would you quit?

568
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,850
我起步太晚  肯定赶不上的
I started too late. I'll never catch up.

569
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,380
卡罗琳  你是台上跳得最好的
Caroline, you were the best dancer on that stage.

570
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,660
怎么  你觉得我还分辨不出才艺吗
What? You think I can't spot talent?

571
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,590
芭蕾要苦练很多年的
Ballet takes years of hard work.

572
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,550
不像马戏团
It's not like the circus.

573
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,630
不能弄虚作假
You can't just fake it.

574
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,430
她不能放弃  不行  她就是...
She can't quit. No. No, I mean, she just--

575
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,970
她就是觉得跟其他姑娘合不来
She just feels out of place with the other girls.

576
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,720
那最好了
Well, I should certainly hope so.

577
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,250
我这辈子从没见过那么多自命不凡的小公主
I've never seen so many little prima Donnas in my life.

578
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,310
是啊  但那些小公主
Yes, but those prima Donnas

579
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,760
是现在对她最重要的人
are the most important thing in the world to her right now.

580
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,210
她会像我当初一样  学会无视她们的
She'll learn to ignore them, just like I did.

581
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,640
她不该有这个必要
She shouldn't have to.

582
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,880
纽约上流社会永远不会接受我们
New York society will never accept us.

583
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,420
否则  他们还得停止对人评头论足
If they did, they'd have to stop judging

584
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,260
而是真去干点实事
and actually do something with their lives.

585
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,560
这不是为了我
This isn't about me.

586
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,400
那么跟其他的一切不一样咯
So it's different than everything else then?

587
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,010
我就是希望她能以自己的身份  自己的家庭为傲
I just want her to be proud of who she is, of her family.

588
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,540
她是的
She is proud.

589
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,460
我们不非得变成卡莱尔一家
We don't have to be the Carlyle's.

590
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,670
卡莱尔先生  这部剧是你制作的
Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play?

591
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,780
是的
Yes I did, indeed.

592
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,190
前门售票处可退款
Refunds are available at the front box office.

593
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,740
-PT·巴纳姆  -马戏团那个
- P.T. Barnum. - From the circus?

594
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,460
是的  你去过吗
Yes. You've been?

595
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,770
当然没有
God, no.

596
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,670
但我看到了你的顾客
But I have seen the crowds.

597
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,960
看完你表演的人比进门之前要开心多了
People leave your shows a great deal happier than when they came in.

598
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,220
我的戏剧可就没有同样的效果了
Which is much more than I can say for my play.

599
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
但你不愁卖不出票
And yet, you have no trouble selling tickets.

600
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,300
那是因为我卖的是美德
That's because I'm selling virtue.

601
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,750
我能请你喝一杯吗
Can I buy you a drink?

602
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,040
我想争取上流社会的观众
I wanna go after the carriage trade.

603
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,990
呈现货真价实的表演  增加我们的卖点
Present legitimate acts, expand our appeal,

604
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,720
争取那些势利眼
go after the snobs.

605
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,820
要是你知道他们多让人受不了
If you only knew how suffocating they are.

606
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,290
那来我们马戏团吧
So come join the circus.

607
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,550
你显然在做表演方面颇有天赋
You clearly have a flair for show business.

608
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,580
教我怎么吸引知识分子
Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows.

609
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,560
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

610
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,280
巴纳姆先生  我不能就这么跑去加入马戏团
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off and join the circus.

611
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,800
有何不可  听上去不是挺刺激的
Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

612
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,880
这么说吧  我觉得
Lets just say that I find it

613
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,310
远远欣赏你的表演要更惬意
much more comfortable admiring your show from afar.

614
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,320
惬意  那是进步的敌人
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

615
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,470
你知道吗  光是跟你扯上关系
Do you understand that just associating with you

616
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,110
我就可能失去继承权
could cost me my inheritance.

617
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,610
我觉得应该不止
It could cost you more than that.

618
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,850
你会赌上一切
You would be risking everything.

619
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,710
但话说回来
But, on the other hand, well,

620
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,000
你或许终于能获得解脱
you just might find yourself a free man.

621
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,280
此地  此时
Right here, right now

622
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,860
我向你发出邀请
I've put the offer out

623
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,220
我不想追着求你
I don't wanna chase you down

624
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,120
我知道你也心里有数
I know you see it

625
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,580
你跟我干
You run with me

626
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,130
我就能帮你解脱
And I can cut you free

627
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,360
跳出那无聊苦闷的高墙
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in

628
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,840
抛下一成不变  换来多姿多彩
So trade your typical for somethin' colorful

629
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,050
就算这是发疯  那也不如过把瘾
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy

630
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,150
你可以遵循理智  恪守传统
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional

631
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,600
也可以赌上一把  看看结果如何
Or you can risk it all and see

632
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:30,610
你难道就不想摆脱桎梏自己的固定角色
Don'tchu wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play

633
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,110
因为我正有你缺的
'Cause I got what you need

634
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,950
跟我来  过把瘾
So come with me and take the ride

635
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,510
我带你去体验另一种生活
It'll take you to the other side

636
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,910
你可以继续走你的老路
'Cause you can do like you do

637
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,380
也可以试试我的法子
Or you can do like me

638
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,460
可以留在牢笼里  也可以终于拿来钥匙
Stay in the cage, or you finally take the key

639
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,570
哎呦喂  这下你便能自由飞翔了
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly

640
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,110
我带你去体验另一种生活
It'll take you to the other side

641
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,950
行了  朋友  你想拉我入伙
Okay, my friend, you wanna cut me in

642
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,020
真是抱歉  但那不可能的
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen

643
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,550
多谢好意  但还是算了
So thanks, but no

644
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,070
我过得好好的
I think I'm good to go

645
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,340
我很喜欢你所谓困住了我的生活
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in

646
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,420
我倒是钦佩你  还有你的那套表演
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do

647
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,380
你是有点本事  这我承认
You're onto somethin', really it's somethin'

648
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,710
但我可是上流人士  我们不用捡花生壳
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells

649
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,640
收拾卫生什么的  还是留给你好了
I'll have to leave that up to you

650
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,460
你难道就不知道我对自己的高贵角色并无不满
Don'tchu know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play

651
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,020
因为我不缺什么
'Cause I got what I need

652
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,950
也不想去过什么瘾
And I don't wanna take the ride

653
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,380
我不需要体验另一种生活
I don't need to see the other side

654
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,740
你大可继续你的法子
So go and do like you do

655
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,340
我还是走我的老路
I'm good to do like me

656
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,280
根本不是牢笼  需要什么钥匙
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key

657
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,530
哎呦喂  没看到我这混得挺好吗
Oh, damn! Can'tchu see I'm doing fine

658
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,200
我不需要体验另一种生活
I don't need to see the other side

659
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,570
你真就想如此度过一生吗
Now is this really how you'd like to spend your days?

660
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,430
借酒消愁  消遣应酬
Whisky, misery and parties and plays?

661
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,580
我要是跟你扯上关系  会被推上风口浪尖
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town

662
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,570
名誉扫地  失去身份  沦为一介小丑
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

663
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,320
但你会终于能享受生活  开心欢笑
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little

664
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,100
只要允许我给你做梦的自由
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll

665
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,530
我就能唤醒你  让你不再痛苦
Wake you up and cure your aching

666
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,610
拆掉你的围墙  让它们崩塌
Take your walls and start 'em breaking

667
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,560
我觉得这笔买卖  你可不亏
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking

668
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,050
但拿主意什么的  还是留给你好了
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

669
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,410
这是有点意思  但答应下来可是代价高昂
Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly

670
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,510
那么我能拿到表演几成的利润呢
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

671
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,750
好吧  你当然会想分一杯羹啦
Well, fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action

672
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,710
我给你7%  咱们握个手就算成了
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

673
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,020
我可不是三岁小孩  18%我可以接受
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine

674
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,180
你干脆说每挣一毛你要拿一双五分好了
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

675
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,940
15%
Fifteen

676
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,780
我可以给8%
I'd do eight

677
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,420
12%
Twelve

678
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,220
9%勉强可以
Maybe nine

679
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,180
10%
Ten

680
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,220
先生  看来你现在有新合伙人了
Sir, it looks like you have yourself a junior partner.

681
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,070
我是有了个贵得要死的学徒
What I have is an overcompensated apprentice.

682
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:06,200
你难道就不想换个新角色演演试试
Don'tchu wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play

683
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,800
因为我正有你缺的
'Cause I got what you need,

684
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,650
跟我来  过把瘾
So come with me and take the ride

685
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,200
去体验另一种生活
To the other side

686
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,590
如果你来试试我的法子
So if you do like I do

687
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,200
如果你来走走我的路
So if you do like me

688
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,190
管他什么牢笼  我们自有钥匙
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key

689
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:23,310
哎呦喂  这下我们便能自由飞翔了
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly

690
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,630
我们要去体验另一种生活
We're goin' to the other side

691
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,990
如果你来试试我的法子
So if you do like I do

692
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,710
体验另一种生活
To the other side

693
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,510
如果你来走走我的路
So if you do like me

694
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,020
去体验另一种生活
Goin' to the other side

695
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,840
这样一来  我们就能去体验另一种生活
'Cause if you do we're goin' to the other side

696
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,790
我们要去体验另一种生活
We're goin' to the other side

697
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,650
那是谁
Who is that?

698
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,810
这后面可没人买帽子  去前面
No one's buying hats back here. Get out front, go.

699
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,350

00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,880
我想向你们介绍我新雇的人
I wanna introduce my newest hire,

701
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,150
菲利普·卡莱尔先生
Mr Philip Carlyle.

702
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,750
-认识你很高兴  -嗯  幸会
- It's a pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, pleasure.

703
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,620
你是表演什么的  卡莱尔先生
And what is your act, Mr. Carlyle?

704
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,660
我不做表演
I don't have an act.

705
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,520
每个人都有自己的表演
Everyone's got an act.

706
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,290
-巴纳姆先生  -怎么
- Mr. Barnum. - Yeah?

707
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,660
你最好来看看
You better come see this.

708
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,330
菲利普  跟上
Philip, keep up.

709
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,020
-不和谐的元素  -一向都有  是吧
- A bit of a nasty element. - There always is, isn't there?

710
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,610
看客最能吸引看客了
Nothing draws a crowd quite like a crowd.

711
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,430
我们的城市不欢迎你们
We don't want you in our city!

712
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,570
滚回去  怪物
Go home you freaks.

713
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,930
怪物
Freaks!

714
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,220
城市污点
"Shame of the city".

715
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,900
抗议坐实了巴纳姆先生
"The protests cement Mr. Barnum's reputation

716
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,900
粗鄙和下流的提供者的名声
"as a purveyor of the offensive and indecent."

717
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,910
"粗鄙下流"
"Offensive and indecent."

718
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,720
班内特先生  我都不好意思了
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

719
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,450
不  我才不好意思
No, I'm blushing.

720
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,490
你管班内特怎么想呢
What do you care what Bennett thinks?

721
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,350
-他是个假正经  -还是个势利眼
- He's a prig. - And a snob.

722
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,250
是啊  但全纽约的势利眼都看他的文章
Yeah, and all the snobs in the New York are reading him.

723
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,630
他告诉他们该怎么想
He does their thinking for them.

724
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,130
不是说要靠争议制造热度吗
What ever happened to thriving off controversy?

725
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,750
是啊  但是
Yeah, well... Look, hey..

726
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,250
-你对此有什么想法吗  -菲利普
- Do you have any thoughts on this? - Philip.

727
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,590
-事实上  我还真有  -海伦  过来
- You know what, as a matter of fact, I do. - Helen, come on.

728
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,990
王室总管
"The master of the Household,

729
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,870
应女王陛下的要求
has it in the command of the Queen...

730
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,340
邀请菲尼斯·T·巴纳姆先生和他的剧团
To invite Mr. Phineas T Barnum and his theatrical troupe

731
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,920
去白金汉宫赴宴
to a reception at Buckingham Palace."

732
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,930
维多利亚女王  真的假的
The Queen Victoria? Is this real?

733
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,560
我动用了些关系
I had to pull a few strings.

734
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,810
如果你想要上流社会接纳你
If you want society to accept you,

735
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,800
那就不如从最上层开始
you may as well start at the very very top.

736
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,200
我们都受邀了吗
Are we all invited?

737
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,490
那我只能告诉女王  我们要么一起去
I guess I'll just have to tell the Queen that either all of us go

738
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,120
要么就都不去
or none of us will.

739
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,470
英国女王  可没有比这更厉害的了
The Queen of England. Can't get much better than that.

740
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,000
-我们怎么不穿燕尾服  -我们是来做表演的
- Why aren't we in tails? - We are the entertainment.

741
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,830
你可没穿戏服
I don't see you in a costume.

742
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,020
女王陛下  菲尼斯·T·巴纳姆先生和他的
Your Majesty, Mr Phineas T Barnum and his...

743
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,120
美国奇人
Oddities from America.

744
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,070
那是真的吗
Is that real?

745
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,310
女王陛下
Your Majesty,

746
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,700
容我介绍
may I present

747
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,420
巴纳姆先生
Mr Barnum.

748
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,210
我很荣幸  巴纳姆先生
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

749
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,800
我从我美国的朋友那里听说了
And I've heard all about your little colonel

750
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,570
你的小上校
from my friends in America.

751
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,820
是将军  女士
General, ma'am.

752
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,150
你比我想的还要小
You're even smaller than I imagined.

753
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,290
你自己也
Well, you're not exactly

754
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,610
不算是很高啊  亲爱的
reaching the top shelf yourself sweetheart.

755
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,300
挺顺利嘛
Ah, that went well.

756
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,570
-女王陛下  -菲利普
- Your Majesty. - Philip.

757
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,510
珍妮·林德小姐
Miss Jenny Lind.

758
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,000
她真是光彩照人
She is luminous.

759
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,270
-那是谁  -歌剧歌手
- Who is that? - The opera singer.

760
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,850
歌手啊
Singer, huh?

761
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,580
她是全欧洲最著名的歌手
She is the most famous performer in all of Europe.

762
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,260
她在斯卡拉十几场演出都售罄
She has sold out La Scala a dozen times.

763
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,730
还有法国剧院
Not to mention the French Opera.

764
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,230
-你干什么  -跟着你
- What are you doing? - Following you...

765
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,210
等你把我介绍给林德小姐
so you can introduce me to Miss Lind.

766
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,330
-介绍你  -对
- Introduce you? - Yeah.

767
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,020
我都不认识她
I don't know her.

768
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,840
人人都认识她  你自己刚说的
Everybody knows her. You just said so yourself.

769
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,510
是啊  你不能就这么冲到这样的人面前
Yeah, exactly. You don't just march up to someone like this.

770
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,660
有何不可  我们相貌堂堂  她也是个人嘛
Why not? We're personable. She's a person.

771
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,740
林德小姐
Miss Lind.

772
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,260
我是菲利普·卡莱尔
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

773
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,330
我身边这位了不起的先生
And this extraordinary gentleman next to me...

774
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,300
菲尼斯·泰勒·巴纳姆  很荣幸
Phineas Taylor Barnum. The pleasure's mine.

775
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,780
当然  你是那个美国人
Of course, you are the American.

776
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,580
我好像是听说过你
I believe I might have heard of you.

777
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,760
是嘛  如果你在大洋彼岸都听说过我
Oh well, if you've heard of me all the way over here,

778
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,190
我肯定是美名远扬
I must be doing something right.

779
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,720
或是臭名昭著
That, or something very wrong.

780
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,910
就宣传而言  这没什么区别
Well, in the world of publicity, there's hardly a difference.

781
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,850
死皮赖脸的人才这么说呢  巴纳姆先生
I believe those are the words of a scoundrel, Mr Barnum.

782
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,670
是马戏团老板  林德小姐  仅此而已
A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman.

783
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,160
而且是大西洋我们这边最好的一位
The best on my side of the Atlantic.

784
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,210
既然你都这么说了
Well, if you do say so yourself.

785
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,320
我是说了  但我不用说的
I do, but I don't have to.

786
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,150
-是啊  他是最好的之一  -是吧
- Oh, no, no. He is one of the best. - Right?

787
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,560
太客气了  林德小姐  我直说吧
That's very kind of you. Miss Lind, let me get to the point.

788
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,910
我想请你去纽约  如果你愿意
I'd like to bring you to New York. And if you agree

789
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,230
我还会让你成为
I'll make you the most famous singer

790
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,430
不仅是欧洲  而是全世界最著名的歌手
not in Europe but in the entire world.

791
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,070
你听过我唱歌吗
And have you heard me sing?

792
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,330
-当然  -没有
- Absolutely. - No, I haven't.

793
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,550
但你像我一样  早已声名远播
But like mine, your reputation precedes you

794
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:29,210
而比起我的品位  我更相信你的名声
and well, I trust your reputation more than my own taste, so...

795
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,520
我还没去过美国呢
I've never been to America.

796
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,170
你将在世界上最伟大的城市
You will sing in the grandest theater...

797
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,850
最豪华的剧院  最好的乐队伴奏下演唱
with the finest orchestra in the greatest city on earth.

798
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,880
珍妮·林德  仅此一晚
"Jenny Lind". "One night only."

799
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,050
或许两晚
Or maybe two.

800
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,640
再加20%的票房  你将收入不菲
And at 20% of the gate, it'll be a queen's ransom for your efforts.

801
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,680
我大部分收入都捐给了慈善事业  巴纳姆先生
I give most of my earnings to charity, Mr Barnum,

802
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,830
捐给孤儿寡妇
to orphans and widows.

803
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,590
"夜莺嗓音  天使之心"
"Voice of a nightingale, Heart of an Angel."

804
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,160
太棒了  媒体会疯狂报道这样的故事
That's brilliant. I mean the press will go crazy for that story.

805
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,700
这可不是什么故事
That's not a story.

806
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,670
我能问你件事吗  巴纳姆先生
May I ask you something, Mr. Barnum?

807
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,430
请讲
Anything.

808
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,640
为什么要我
Why me?

809
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,320
人们来看我的表演是为了开心地被骗
People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked.

810
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,650
就这一次  我想给他们点真实的东西
Just once, I'd love to give them something real.

811
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,140
林德小姐
Miss Lind.

812
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,250
所有人都来了  看啊
Everyone is here. Look at this.

813
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,960
温斯洛普夫妇都来了
Even the Winthrops.

814
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,880
你开心了吗
Are you happy?

815
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,630
如果成功  我就开心了
I will be, if this works.

816
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,050
天呐  希望她唱得好
Oh, God, I hope she can sing.

817
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,040
-她怎么还没出来  -他们还在就坐
- What's taking her so long? - They're still taking their seats.

818
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,200
-说到这个  -怎么
- Speaking of which. - Yeah?

819
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,880
-汤姆和莱蒂他们刚到了  -什么
- Tom and Lettie, the others, they've just arrived. - What?

820
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,510
我该叫他们坐哪  你的包厢吗
Where should I put 'em? Your box?

821
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,560
-包厢  不行  太显眼了  -显眼
- That box? No, no, no, that's a bit visible. - Visible?

822
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,460
两侧的站席音效其实更好
The acoustics are actually better in the standing room.

823
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,740
让他们去那里吧
That's where they should be.

824
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,000
林德小姐准备好了
Miss Lind's ready now.

825
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,040
好  谢谢  太好了
OK. Thank you. Thank God.

826
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,390
这里好棒
This is so awesome.

827
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,490
-多美啊  -是啊
- Isn't it wonderful? - Yeah.

828
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,920
-我好喜欢  -看那幕布
- I love it. - Look at the curtain.

829
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,190
女士们先生们  感谢大家耐心等待
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.

830
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,830
他上不了这种台面
He's out of his element.

831
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,280
这怎么回事
What is this about?

832
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,860
那是巴纳姆吗
Is that Barnum?

833
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,040
这里又不是马戏团
This isn't the circus.

834
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,380
我最近有幸
I recently had the privilege of

835
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,320
听到了世界上
hearing the most divine voice

836
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,300
最动人的歌声
I've ever heard.

837
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,870
他还突然成鉴赏家了
Suddenly he's a connoisseur.

838
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,260
我知道这听上去像是巴纳姆的吹嘘
Now, I know that sounds like Barnum humbug...

839
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,350
但我冰镇了一百瓶上好的香槟  我敢保证
but I have 100 bottles of good champagne on ice that says

840
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,630
这可不是什么新奇的小表演
this isn't just another sideshow novelty.

841
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,370
有请  瑞典夜莺
May I present, the Swedish Nightingale...

842
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,550
珍妮·林德小姐
Miss Jenny Lind.

843
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,030
我努力想屏住呼吸
I'm tryin' to hold my breath

844
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,390
让时间凝固
Let it stay this way

845
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,540
不愿让这一刻结束
Can't let this moment end

846
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,310
你在我心中埋下一个梦想
You set off a dream in me

847
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,110
它越来越响亮
Gettin' louder now

848
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,390
你能否听到那回音
Can you hear it echoing?

849
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,110
握住我的手
Take my hand

850
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,290
你可愿与我分享此刻
Will you share this with me?

851
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,510
亲爱的  如果没有你
'Cause darlin' without you

852
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,570
哪怕是千万盏聚光灯的光芒
All the shine of a thousand spotlights

853
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:17,250
哪怕是我们从夜空中偷来的全部星光
All the stars we steal from the night sky

854
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,430
也永远无法让我满足
Will never be enough

855
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,410
无法让我满足
Never be enough

856
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,290
黄金高塔也还是不够大
Towers of gold are still too little

857
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,230
我能把世界握在手中  可那也
These hands could hold the world but it'll

858
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,450
无法让我满足
Never be enough

859
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,730
无法让我满足
Never be enough

860
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,630
无法满足
For me

861
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,430
永远  永远
Never, never

862
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,040
永远  永远
Never, never

863
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:53,320
永远  无法
Never, for me

864
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,730
满足
For me

865
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,830
无法让我满足
Never enough

866
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,510
无法让我满足
Never enough

867
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,120
无法让我满足
Never enough

868
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,890
无法满足
For me

869
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,810
无法满足
For me

870
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,290
无法满足
For me

871
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,770
哪怕是千万盏聚光灯的光芒
All the shine of a thousand spotlights

872
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,250
哪怕是我们从夜空中偷来的全部星光
All the stars we steal from the night sky

873
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,560
也永远无法让我满足
Will never be enough

874
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:28,490
无法让我满足
Never be enough

875
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,950
黄金高塔也还是不够大
Towers of gold are still too little

876
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,880
我能把世界握在手中  可那也
These hands could hold the world but it'll

877
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,030
无法让我满足
Never be enough

878
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:46,300
无法让我满足
Never be enough

879
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,230
无法满足
For me

880
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,750
永远  永远
Never, never

881
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,390
永远  永远
Never, never

882
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,850
永远  无法
Never, for me

883
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,880
满足
For me

884
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,260
无法让我满足
Never enough

885
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,980
永远  永远
Never, never

886
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,770
无法让我满足
Never enough

887
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,640
永远  永远
Never, never

888
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,620
无法让我满足
Never enough

889
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,350
无法满足
For me

890
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,400
无法满足
For me

891
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,640
无法满足
For me

892
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,500
无法满足
For me

893
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,460
太精彩了
Brava!

894
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,240
-太棒了  -再来一首
- Brava! - More!

895
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,330
太美了
Wonderful!

896
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,520
精彩
Bravissima!

897
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,330
再来
More!

898
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,960
-精彩  -太棒了
- Excellent! - Brava!

899
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,910
安可
Encore.

900
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,710
珍妮  这是我妻子夏瑞蒂和我们的女儿
Jenny, this is my wife Charity and our girls.

901
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,930
当然  我听说了你们好多事呢
Of course, and I've heard so much about you.

902
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,030
你父亲还告诉我你喜欢芭蕾舞
And your father tells me you're a fan of the ballet.

903
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,540
-是的  我在学芭蕾  -是吗
- Yes, I'm studying ballet. - Oh, are you?

904
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,170
-当然了  -当然了
- Of course I am. - And of course she is.

905
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,510
-那你呢  海伦  -你像个公主  女士
- And what about you, Helen? - You look like a princess, ma'am.

906
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,770
我得承认  巴纳姆  她的确非同一般
I have to admit, Barnum, she is remarkable.

907
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,680
就连最无趣的评论家也觉得有趣了  是吗
Enough to bring joy to the most joyless critic, isn't she?

908
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,000
如果是由真正的艺术经理人打理
And in the hands of a real purveyor of the arts,

909
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,950
她真的可以在这个国家大有发展
she could be something in this country.

910
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,330
可惜她搭上了你
Shame she's fallen in with you.

911
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,310
你真是在纸面上更讨喜  班内特先生
You really are better on the page, Mr Bennett.

912
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,640
虽然这难以置信
Hard as that is to believe.

913
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,110
-巴纳姆先生  -怎么
- Mr. Barnum? - Yes.

914
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,110
我想见见林德小姐
I'd love to meet Miss Lind.

915
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,370
-当然可以  -可以为我们介绍一下吗
- And you will meet miss Lind - Would you introduce us?

916
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,510
请稍等一下
if you just give me a moment...

917
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,940
-菲尼斯  -嗯
- Phineas. - Yes.

918
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,700
你做得不错
You've done well.

919
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,000
谢谢
Thank you.

920
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,980
容我为你们引见
Allow me to introduce you.

921
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,950
打扰下  珍妮  见见夏瑞蒂的父母
Excuse me, Jenny. I would like you to meet Charity's parents.

922
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,570
-哈利特先生和太太  -幸会
- Mr and Mrs Hallett. - Ah, pleasure.

923
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,550
-你好  认识你很高兴  -认识你很高兴
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you. - Good to meet you.

924
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,290
-妈妈  -你好  亲爱的
- Mother. - Hello dear.

925
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,910
-这是  -是啊  那是你的外孙女
- Are these... - Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters.

926
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,230
-菲尼斯  别在这儿闹  -是吗
- Phineas, not here. - Not here?

927
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,080
你担心我会在你父母的体面朋友面前
You afraid I'm gonna embarrass your parents

928
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,470
让他们下不来台吗
in front of their fancy friends?

929
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,810
我恐怕是没那个本事
I really don't think that I have that power.

930
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,150
就我这样的小人物
An insignificant man like me...

931
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,400
显然注定只能过渺小的一生
who was clearly destined to lead an insignificant life.

932
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,350
就算腰缠万贯  也还是那个裁缝的儿子
All that fortune and still just the tailor's boy.

933
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,170
滚出去
Get out.

934
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,570
好吧  菲尼斯
Well, Phineas...

935
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,800
我不是跟你说过  免费香槟
I believe I told you that free champagne

936
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,340
肯定要搞出麻烦来
is a recipe for disaster.

937
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,770
夏瑞蒂
Charity.

938
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,400
-请大家举杯  -夏瑞蒂
- Now would everyone please raise their glasses? - Charity.

939
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,410
敬巴纳姆先生  他永远地证明了
To Mr Barnum, who has shown once and for all

940
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,740
一个人的地位只受他眼界的限制
that a man's station is limited only by his imagination.

941
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,570
-敬巴纳姆  -谢谢
- To Barnum. - Thank you.

942
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,250
敬巴纳姆先生
To Mr Barnum.

943
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,510
谢谢
Thank you.

944
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,020
生来拥有财富和特权的人
It's hard to understand wealth and privilege

945
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,540
反而不懂它的重要性
when you're born into it.

946
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,960
我有时也觉得自己不属于这里
I sometimes don't feel like I belong here.

947
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,330
你怎么会
You?

948
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,690
我是个私生女
I was born out of wedlock

949
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,040
这给我的家族蒙了羞
and that brought shame upon my family.

950
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,210
生活总能提醒我
And life always manages to remind me

951
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,570
我不配在这世上存在
that I don't deserve a place in this world.

952
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:48,060
这留下了起立鼓掌永远无法填补的空虚
And that leaves a hole that no ovation can ever fill.

953
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,020
-菲尼斯先生  -大伙儿们
- Mr. Phineas! - Guys...

954
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,700
-天呐  那女士真能唱  -是啊
- Lord, that lady can sing. - I know.

955
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,560
你觉得她会喜欢穿制服的男人吗
Thinks she likes a man in uniform?

956
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,550
她肯定喜欢
I'm sure she does.

957
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,030
你们干什么呢  你们一小时后还要上台呢
Okay, what are you doing here? You got a show in an hour, OK?

958
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,300
那我们至少也有时间喝三杯了
That's enough time for us to have at least three drinks, right?

959
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:05,880
来吧
Come on, let's go.

960
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,680
-不行  莱蒂  -怎么了
- No no. Lettie. - What?

961
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,410
这里已经很挤了  你们不能进去交际
It's very crowded in here, okay? And I can't have you mingling.

962
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,960
各位  如果你们就这么抛头露面
Guys, who's gonna pay admission

963
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,300
谁还会花钱买门票啊
if you're out there for all the world to see.

964
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,720
-表演顺利  -等等
- Okay? Have a great show. - Wait...

965
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,360
女士们先生们  请举杯
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.

966
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,810
珍妮  美国现在还不知道
Jenny, America may not know it yet,

967
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,290
但他们会爱上你的
but they are going to love you.

968
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,420
敬林德小姐
To Miss Lind.

969
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,610
我对黑暗并不陌生
I am not a stranger to the dark

970
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,360
人们都说  躲起来吧
Hide away, they say

971
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,230
我们并不想看到你残破的样子
'Cause we don't want your broken parts

972
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:47,410
我的缺陷都成了羞耻的标记
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars

973
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,270
人们都说  快跑掉吧
Run away, they say

974
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:53,230
没人会喜欢你真实的模样
No one'll love you as you are

975
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,650
但我不会允许他们把我碾压成尘
But I won't let them break me down to dust

976
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,080
我知道这世界有我们容身的地方
I know that there's a place for us

977
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,530
因为我们是如此绚丽
For we are glorious

978
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,710
当尖刻的话语像刀枪要将我击垮
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down

979
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:14,810
我要释放滚滚洪流淹没他们的叫嚣
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out

980
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,490
我勇敢  我有伤
I am brave, I am bruised

981
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,320
我是本就灿烂的我  我就是这样
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me

982
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,220
小心点  我要来了
Look out 'cause here I come

983
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:29,940
我和着自己敲响的鼓点大步向前
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum

984
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,410
我不怕被人看到
I'm not scared to be seen

985
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:36,330
也不为自己道歉  我就是这样
I make no apologies, this is me

986
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,890
他们怎么跑到这儿来了
What are they doing here?

987
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:54,250
又一轮讥讽的子弹打在我身上
Another round of bullets hits my skin

988
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,530
你们开火吧  今天  我不会再被羞耻压垮
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in

989
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,540
我们要冲破重重阻碍
We are bursting through the barricades

990
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,260
往太阳的方向前进
And reaching for the sun

991
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,380
我们是勇士
We are warriors

992
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,960
没错  这就是如今的我们
Yeah, that's what we've become

993
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,810
我不会允许他们把我碾压成尘
I won't let them break me down to dust

994
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,440
我知道这世界有我们容身的地方
I know that there's a place for us

995
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,740
滚回家
Go home.

996
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,620
因为我们是如此绚丽
For we are glorious

997
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:24,410
当尖刻的话语像刀枪要将我击垮
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down

998
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,410
我要释放滚滚洪流淹没他们的叫嚣
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out

999
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,600
我勇敢  我有伤
I am brave, I am bruised

1000
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,190
我是本就灿烂的我  我就是这样
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me

1001
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,730
小心点  我要来了
Look out 'cause here I come

1002
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:44,400
我和着自己敲响的鼓点大步向前
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum

1003
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,510
我不怕被人看到
I'm not scared to be seen

1004
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:51,320
也不为自己道歉  我就是这样
I make no apologies, this is me

1005
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,190
我就是这样
...This is me

1006
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:13,210
我清楚我值得被爱
And I know that I deserve your love

1007
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:18,890
我没什么配不上的
There's nothing I'm not worthy of

1008
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,350
当尖刻的话语像刀枪要将我击垮
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down

1009
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:29,620
我要释放滚滚洪流淹没他们的叫嚣
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out

1010
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,680
这是勇敢  是受过伤
This is brave, this is bruised

1011
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,470
这是注定灿烂的我  我就是这样
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

1012
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:41,930
小心点  我要来了
Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come)

1013
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,590
我和着自己敲响的鼓点大步向前
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum

1014
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,590
-大步向前  -和着自己敲响的鼓点
- Marchin' on, marchin', marchin' on - To the beat I drum

1015
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,760
我不怕被人看到
I'm not scared to be seen

1016
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,330
也不为自己道歉  我就是这样
I make no apologies, this is me

1017
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,750
当尖刻的话语像刀枪要将我击垮
Whenever the words wanna cut me down

1018
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,320
我要释放滚滚洪流淹没他们的叫嚣
I'll send the flood to drown 'em out

1019
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,880
我要释放滚滚洪流
I'm gonna send a flood

1020
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,320
淹没他们的叫嚣
Gonna drown them out

1021
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,650
我就是这样
This is me

1022
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,830
怎么就不能在纽约多办几场表演
Why can't you just put more shows in New York?

1023
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,040
何必非要全国巡演
Why do you need to tour the country?

1024
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,970
拿破仑为什么要进攻俄国
Why did Napoleon march on Russia?

1025
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,750
拿破仑被打败了啊
Napoleon was defeated.

1026
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,110
拿破仑没有60人管弦乐队
Napoleon didn't have a 60 piece orchestra.

1027
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,630
60人管弦乐队
A 60 piece orchestra.

1028
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:26,120
请最便宜的乐师  这个交给你
Just get the cheapest musicians you can, and watch that.

1029
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,990
我们还得包食宿
We'll still have to board them.

1030
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,590
请夫妻  让他们睡一个铺
We'll get married ones. They can share a bunk.

1031
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,430
奥马利  那是卡罗琳的储蓄罐
O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank.

1032
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,320
-定制布景  -嗯
- Custom sets? - Yeah.

1033
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,430
焰火  在剧院内放吗
Fireworks? Inside theaters?

1034
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,960
好点子
That's genius.

1035
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,540
不  PT  这都是国内最负盛名的剧院
No. P.T. these are the most famous theaters in the country.

1036
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,510
他们会要你提前包下门票
They make you buy the seats in advance

1037
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,990
-才能订场地  -是啊  我贷了款
- just to book them. - Yeah, yeah. I took out a loan.

1038
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,260
我们还要给珍妮报酬
And we have to pay Jenny

1039
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,240
-而且是预付  -贷了挺大一笔
- in advance? - It was a large loan. Okay?

1040
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,140
你在第40场表演之前都无法盈利
You're not gonna see a penny of profit until your 40th show.

1041
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,520
其实是41场
41st actually.

1042
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,100
你赌上了你建立的一切
You're risking everything you've built here.

1043
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,420
你以为这一切怎么建起来的
How do you think I built it?

1044
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,430
这之后就能有足够利润了
We'll have plenty of profits to go around after this.

1045
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:55,500
-PT  -怎么了
- P.T? - What?

1046
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,790
你的注意力已经被分散太久了
Your attention has been divided long enough.

1047
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,250
我们上座率下降了  每天都有更多人来抗议
Our gate is down, we have more protesters every day.

1048
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,770
你需要拢住回头客
You just need to get people to come back.

1049
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,760
如果你最近没去过巴纳姆博物馆
"If you haven't been to the Barnum museum lately,

1050
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,200
就肯定不知道里面什么样
You haven't been at the Barnum Museum."

1051
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,480
他们是来看你的
They come to see you.

1052
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,240
你的疯狂点子  你的新表演  不寻常的景象
Your crazy ideas, your new acts, the unusual.

1053
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,780
那你给他们笑一个好了  那多不寻常
Then how about you show them a smile. That'd be unusual.

1054
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,160
继续彩排  让他们清楚我要求他们
Keep rehearsing. Just make it very clear I expect them

1055
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,090
对你表现出应有的尊重
to afford you all the deference you deserve...

1056
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,860
而且他们本来也该对你客客气气的
And that they should be nice to you anyway.

1057
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,170
真让人看了就开心啊
Ain't that a sight for sore eyes?

1058
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,890
-都不说声你好  -或是再见
- He couldn't even say hello. - Or goodbye.

1059
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,070
他要去巡演了  抱歉  各位
He is going on tour. Sorry guys.

1060
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:31,700
别垂头丧气的  卡莱尔  你不是还要赴约吗
Pull yourself together, Carlyle. Don't you have somewhere to be?

1061
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,590
安·维勒
Anne Wheeler.

1062
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,000
巴纳姆先生说他给我留了票
Mr. Barnum said he left a ticket for me.

1063
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1064
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,240
应该是只有一张的
I believe there's only supposed to be one.

1065
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,820
不  就是两张
No, there's meant to be two.

1066
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,160
我怕我直接约你不会答应
I wasn't sure you'd come if I asked.

1067
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,450
五分钟后开场
Five minutes to curtains.

1068
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,570
我一直想进剧院
I've always wanted to go to the theater.

1069
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,650
菲利普  是你吗
Phillip, is that you?

1070
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,370
妈妈  爸爸
Mother. Father.

1071
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,760
这位是安·维勒
This is Anne Wheeler.

1072
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,450
菲利普  你不知耻吗
Phillip, have you no shame?

1073
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:31,950
跟巴纳姆的生意扯上关系还是一码事
Associating yourself with that Barnum business is one thing...

1074
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,720
居然还带着女佣出来招摇过市
but parading around with the help.

1075
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:37,940
安
Anne.

1076
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,030
安
Anne.

1077
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,330
安
Anne.

1078
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,120
你怎么敢那么对她说话
How dare you speak to her like that?

1079
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,840
-你忘记自己的身份了  菲利普  -我的身份
- You forget your place, Phillip. - My place?

1080
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,460
妈妈  如果我的身份就这样
Mother, if this is my place,

1081
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,310
那我一点也不想要
then I don't want any part of it.

1082
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:10,370
安
Anne.

1083
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,980
他们是狭隘的人
They're small minded people.

1084
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,850
-你何必在意他们说什么  -不止是他们
- Why do you care what they think? - It's not just them.

1085
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,250
你从没感受过
You've never had somebody look at you

1086
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,920
你父母投给我的那种眼光
the way your parents looked at me.

1087
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,800
所有人都会对我们投来那样的眼光
The way everyone would look at us.

1088
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,710
你知道我渴望你
You know I want you

1089
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,990
这并非秘密  我不想隐瞒
It's not a secret I try to hide

1090
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,570
我知道你渴望我
I know you want me

1091
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:55,570
别说什么我们无能为力
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied

1092
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,140
你说你没有这命
You claim it's not in the cards

1093
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,060
命运将你拉到天涯海角
And fate is pulling you miles away

1094
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,890
让我无法触及
And out of reach from me

1095
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,630
可你就在我心中
But you're here in my heart

1096
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,720
那么谁又能阻止我认定
So who can stop me if I decide

1097
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,210
你就是我的命中注定
That you're my destiny?

1098
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:17,760
或许我们可以改写星运
What if we rewrite the stars?

1099
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,600
让你成为我的注定
Say you were made to be mine

1100
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,580
没什么能将我们拆散
Nothing could keep us apart

1101
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:29,350
而你是我最终的归宿
You'd be the one I was meant to find

1102
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,070
这由你决定
It's up to you

1103
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:32,870
也由我决定
And it's up to me

1104
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,950
没人能决定我们非要如何
No one can say what we get to be

1105
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,810
那我们何不改写星运
So why don't we rewrite the stars?

1106
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:45,250
或许世界也可以由我们掌握
Maybe the world could be ours

1107
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,410
哪怕只此一夜
Tonight

1108
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,790
你以为这不让我痛苦
You think it's easy

1109
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,400
你以为我不想冲到你身边吗
You think I don't want to run to you

1110
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,120
但我们之间的阻隔犹如大山
But there are mountains

1111
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,880
或是无论如何都跨不过的门槛
And there are doors that we can't walk through

1112
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,070
我知道你并不信服
I know you're wonderin' why

1113
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,930
因为我们可以
Because we're able to be

1114
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:16,040
只做自己
Just you and me

1115
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,990
但那是在这个小世界里
Within these walls

1116
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,790
一旦我们出去
But when we go outside

1117
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:28,070
你便会清醒地认识到  这根本毫无希望
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

1118
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,760
没人能改写星运
No one can rewrite the stars

1119
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,670
你怎么能说你会属于我
How can you say you'll be mine

1120
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:41,480
一切都在拆散我们
Ev'rything keeps us apart

1121
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,340
我也并非你最终的归宿
And I'm not the one you were meant to find

1122
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,030
你决定不了
It's not up to you

1123
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,990
我决定不了
It's not up to me

1124
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:52,950
每个人都认定了我们应当如何
When everyone tells us what we can be

1125
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,750
我们怎么能改写星运
How can we rewrite the stars?

1126
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:01,000
傻傻认为世界可以由我们掌握
Say that the world can be ours

1127
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,310
哪怕只此一夜
Tonight

1128
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,000
我只想与你一起翱翔
All I want is to fly with you

1129
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,030
我只想与你一起坠落
All I want is to fall with you

1130
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:14,630
所以把你的一切交给我
So just give me all of you

1131
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,620
这似乎全无可能
It feels impossible

1132
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,540
这并非全无可能
It's not impossible

1133
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,330
这是否全无可能
Is it impossible?

1134
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:22,000
告诉我这仍有可能
Say that it's possible

1135
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,640
我们要如何改写星运
How do we rewrite the stars?

1136
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,490
让你成为我的注定
Say you were made to be mine?

1137
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:33,110
没什么能将我们拆散
Nothing can keep us apart

1138
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:37,260
因为你是我最终的归宿
Cause you are the one I was meant to find

1139
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,960
这由你决定
It's up to you

1140
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,890
也由我决定
And it's up to me

1141
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:44,850
没人能决定我们非要如何
No one can say what we get to be

1142
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:48,680
我们何不改写星运
Why don't we rewrite the stars?

1143
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,940
改变世界让它由我们掌握
Changin' the world to be ours

1144
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,750
你知道我渴望你
You know I want you

1145
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,610
这并非秘密  我不想隐瞒
It's not a secret I try to hide

1146
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,370
但我不能拥有你
But I can't have you

1147
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,530
我们注定要分离
We're bound to break and

1148
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,440
我也无能为力
My hands are tied

1149
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,860
先是在我父母家旁边买了房子
First it was buying a house on the same street as my parents.

1150
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,110
然后又是去见女王
Then meeting the Queen.

1151
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:40,040
然后请来了珍妮·林德
Then bringing Jenny Lind,

1152
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,540
那晚又跟我父亲针锋相对
then my father the other night.

1153
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,630
你什么时候才算满足啊
When will it ever be enough for you?

1154
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,210
我这么做是为了卡罗琳和海伦
I'm doing this for Caroline and Helen.

1155
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,470
抬眼看看啊  她们什么都不缺了
Look around you. They have everything.

1156
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:51,150
-你不懂  -我懂
- You don't understand. - I do understand.

1157
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,500
不  你不懂
No. You don't understand!

1158
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,020
你怎么能懂呢
How could you?

1159
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,390
我父亲被视如粪土
My father was treated like dirt.

1160
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,450
我也曾被视如粪土
I was treated like dirt.

1161
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,860
我的孩子绝不能再如此
And my children will not be.

1162
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,810
你不需要让每个人都爱你  菲尼
You don't need everyone to love you, Phin.

1163
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:12,130
就几个好人就够了
Just a few good people.

1164
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:15,580
我知道
I know that.

1165
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,100
先生
Sir.

1166
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,060
不  爸爸
No. Daddy.

1167
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,460
爸爸
Daddy.

1168
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,340
爸爸  别走  等等
Daddy, no. Wait.

1169
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
-爸爸  -走吧
- Daddy. - Go.

1170
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,590
等等  爸爸
Wait, Daddy.

1171
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:46,300
有的人渴望简单的生活  规划明确
Some people long for a life that is simple and planned

1172
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,060
像精致的束缚
Tied with a ribbon

1173
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:54,640
有的人不肯去海上出航  因为陆上更安稳
Some people won't sail the sea 'cause they're safer on land

1174
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,920
只遵从既定轨迹
To follow what's written

1175
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,530
但我追随你  步入无限未知
But I'd follow you to the great unknown

1176
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:14,700
前往属于我们自己的世界
Off to a world we call our own

1177
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:23,580
山岳峡谷星星点点  点缀在
Mountains and valleys, and all that will come in between

1178
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,900
沙漠和大海之间
Desert and ocean

1179
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:32,320
你拉上我  我们一起沉溺于梦中
You pull me in and together we're lost in a dream

1180
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:35,750
时刻变幻
Always in motion

1181
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:43,500
我赌上一切  只为与你同行
So I risk it all just to be with you

1182
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:52,740
我赌上一切  选择了我们的生活
And I risk it all for this life we choose

1183
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,330
手握着手
Hand in my hand

1184
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:59,610
你说好永远不放手
And you promised to never let go

1185
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,570
我们在走着钢丝
We're walkin' a tightrope

1186
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,260
云霄之上
High in the sky

1187
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:08,870
我们把脚下世界尽收眼底
We can see the whole world down below

1188
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:12,910
我们在走着钢丝
We're walkin' a tightrope

1189
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:20,720
无从知道  一旦坠落  你可会接住我
Never sure Will you catch me if I should fall

1190
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,070
这是一场冒险
Well, it's all an adventure

1191
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,600
而且一路上风景美不胜收
That comes with a breathtakin' view

1192
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,910
走着钢丝
Walkin' a tightrope

1193
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,300
与你一起
With you...

1194
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,340
与你一起
With you...

1195
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,740
与你一起
With you...

1196
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:16,140
与你一起
With you...

1197
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:26,930
与你一起
With you...

1198
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,940
与你一起
With you...

1199
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,410
就好像我们终于第一次知道
"It is as though we have learned for the first time...

1200
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,320
歌唱的真正意义
what singing really is."

1201
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:54,030
林德小姐理当得到我国最高的尊敬
Miss Lind deserves our nation's highest esteem

1202
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,710
和最热情的掌声
and most lavish ovations.

1203
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,870
-天呐  -世界拜倒在我们脚下了
- I mean... - The world at our feet.

1204
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,440
好了  巴纳姆先生
Well, Mr. Barnum.

1205
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:06,690
这杯酒
This...

1206
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,400
敬
is...

1207
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,310
实现梦想
to making dreams come true.

1208
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,280
谢谢  珍妮
Thank you, Jenny.

1209
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,180
还有两小时开场
It's two hours to curtains.

1210
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,770
我已经给了你全世界  是吧
I've given you the world, haven't I?

1211
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:41,430
我该走了
I, I should go.

1212
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,040
我让你分心了  对不起  珍妮
I've become a distraction. I'm sorry, Jenny.

1213
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,950
-不  -你自己完成巡演吧
- No. - You should finish the tour without me.

1214
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,720
什么  你要走了
What? You're leaving?

1215
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,520
-行程都规划好了  -就这样了
- Well, the itinerary's well in hand. - So that's it.

1216
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:51,520
什么意思
What do you mean?

1217
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,550
我只不过又是你的一个节目
I'm just another one of your little acts.

1218
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,680
-珍妮  -我不干了
- Jenny. - I'm done.

1219
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:01,050
珍妮  拜托
Jenny, Jenny, please.

1220
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,690
你必须完成巡演
You have to finish the tour.

1221
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,930
-是吗  -否则我就完了
- Must I? - It will ruin me.

1222
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,040
如果你待人不谨慎  巴纳姆先生
When you're careless with other people, Mr Barnum,

1223
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,790
就是自毁前程
you bring ruin upon yourself.

1224
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:15,320
-我赌上了一切  -我也是
- I have risked everything. - Well, so did I.

1225
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,470
看来我们都输了
And it seems we both lost.

1226
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:27,090
哪怕是我们从夜空中偷来的全部星光
All the stars we steal from the night sky

1227
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:31,250
也永远无法让我满足
Will never be enough

1228
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:35,310
无法让我满足
Never be enough

1229
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:40,200
黄金高塔也还是不够大
Towers of gold are still too little

1230
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:45,030
我能把世界握在手中  可那也
These hands could hold the world but it'll

1231
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:48,510
无法让我满足
Never be enough

1232
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:53,500
无法让我满足
Never be enough

1233
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,570
谢谢
Thank you.

1234
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:38,300
这是干什么
What was that?

1235
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:40,990
告别
That was goodbye.

1236
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,000
谢谢各位前来
Thank you very much for coming.

1237
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,780
-去告诉朋友街邻  -表演真精彩
- Tell your friends and neighbors. - What a wonderful show.

1238
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,230
谁看得开心  你吗
Who enjoyed themselves? You? You?

1239
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,250
告诉别人你们在马戏团看得多开心
Tell everyone how much fun you had at the circus.

1240
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,970
每晚都有新节目
New acts every night.

1241
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:59,140
马戏团长
Hey, ringmaster.

1242
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,310
先生们  我得请你们离开了
Gentlemen, gonna have to ask you to leave.

1243
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:06,940
这是我们的城市  小子
This is our town, son.

1244
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,110
你们才该走  你和你的怪物
We think you should leave, you and your freaks.

1245
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,680
你的黑鬼
And yours spooks.

1246
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:14,770
先生
Sir.

1247
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:18,210
我只再说一遍
I will only ask once more.

1248
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,520
然后怎样  小子
Then what, boy?

1249
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:22,980
住手
Stop!

1250
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,700
打他
Get him!

1251
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:29,430
冲啊
Charge.

1252
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,010
爸爸
Daddy.

1253
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,950
爸爸
Daddy.

1254
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,670
姑娘们
Girls. Girls. Girls.

1255
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:07,220
你们长得好快  不许再长了
You've grown so much. Stop it!

1256
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,650
你怎么决定提前回来了
What made you decide to come back early?

1257
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,580
我想你了
I missed you.

1258
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,750
-我想你了  -这听上去好像是唬人的话呢
- I missed you. - That sounds an awful lot like Humbug.

1259
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,730
着火了
Fire.

1260
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,580
-让路  -快走
- Move aside! - Come on!

1261
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,360
快  是马戏团那边着起来的
Hurry, it's coming from the circus.

1262
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,710
快走  着火了
Run! Let's go! Fire!

1263
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,680
姑娘们  跟上我  跟上  快来
Girls, stay with me, stay with me. Come. Quick, quick!

1264
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,530
大家都跟紧了
Everyone! Stay close.

1265
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,300
菲利普  大家都出来了吗
Phillip, is everyone out?

1266
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,060
-大家都没事吧  -嗯
- Is everyone okay? - Yeah.

1267
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:43,990
动物呢
The animals? The animals?

1268
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,980
放了  还能怎么办
We set them free. What else could we do?

1269
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:49,040
-WD  安呢  -安在哪
- W.D., where is Anne? - Where is Anne?

1270
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:51,020
别  菲利普  别去
No, Phillip. No.

1271
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,320
不  站住  你不能进去
No. Stop. You can not go inside.

1272
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,490
安
Anne.

1273
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:56,350
菲利普
Philip!

1274
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,050
继续泵水
Keep pumping.

1275
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,020
-WD  -她出来了
- W.D.. - There she is. There she is.

1276
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:05,820
菲利普
Phillip.

1277
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,700
-菲利普  -爸爸
- Phillip. - Daddy.

1278
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,550
-不要  爸爸  -爸爸
- No, Daddy! - Daddy!

1279
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,000
不要
No.

1280
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,610
别过去
Stay back, please.

1281
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,840
爸爸
Daddy.

1282
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,550
担架
Stretcher, stretcher.

1283
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:55,410
他吸了很多烟  他还有气  快
He's taken a lot of smoke. He's still breathing. Come on.

1284
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,690
把他抬上去
Come on, let's get him on!

1285
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,430
起
Up.

1286
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,530
或许我们可以改写星运
What if we rewrite the stars?

1287
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:48,010
让你成为我的注定
Say you were meant to be mine?

1288
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:55,120
没什么能让我们分离
Nothing can keep us apart

1289
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:07,380
而你是我最终的归宿
you are the one I was meant to find.

1290
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:13,320
走吧
Here we go, guys!

1291
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:15,900
往前走
Come on, straight ahead.

1292
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,340
如果你是来幸灾乐祸的  还是算了
If you had come to gloat I wouldn't.

1293
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,400
纵火的暴徒被抓到了
They caught the thugs who started the fire.

1294
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,740
我觉得你会想知道
I thought you'd like to know.

1295
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,290
我从不喜欢你的表演
I never liked your show.

1296
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,700
但我一直觉得观众很喜欢
But I always thought the people did.

1297
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,060
是啊  他们一直喜欢
They did. They do.

1298
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:14,660
不过  我可不会称之为艺术
Mind you, I wouldn't call it art.

1299
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,610
当然了
Of course not.

1300
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,240
但是
But...

1301
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,550
让各种各样的人跟你一起站在舞台上
Putting folks of all kinds on stage with you.

1302
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:27,970
不论他们有何肤色  体型
All colors, shapes, sizes.

1303
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,830
都将他们平等地呈现出来
Presenting them as equals.

1304
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:34,730
换了别的评论家甚至可能称之为
Why, another critic might have even called it

1305
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,050
"人性的颂歌"
'a celebration of humanity'.

1306
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,280
我喜欢这个
I would have liked that.

1307
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,830
希望你会重建
Well, I hope you'll rebuild.

1308
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,690
幸好还有珍妮的巡演  可以从利润里拿出钱来
I mean, thank God for Jenny's tour. We can borrow off the profits.

1309
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:52,560
我们没事的
We'll be fine.

1310
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:53,880
你不知道吗
You don't know?

1311
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:03,990
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

1312
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,440
夏瑞蒂
Charity?

1313
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,240
天呐  夏瑞蒂
Oh God, Charity.

1314
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,190
-我...  -我不想跟你说话
- I am... - I don't wanna talk to you.

1315
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,240
根本什么都没发生
Nothing happened.

1316
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,580
-这是无稽之谈  -什么都没发生
- This is ridiculous. - Oh, sure, nothing happened.

1317
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:24,140
纽约所有的报纸都登了
It's on the cover of every paper in New York.

1318
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,500
是她设计了那张照片  我并不爱她
Because she orchestrated the photo. I'm not in love with her.

1319
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,790
当然了
Of course you're not.

1320
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,580
不爱她  不爱我  不爱任何人
Not with her, not with me, not with anyone.

1321
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,220
只爱你和你的表演
Just you and your show.

1322
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,280
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1323
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,920
我要回家
I'm going home.

1324
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,710
这就是你的家
This is your home.

1325
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,910
银行
The bank..

1326
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,680
要驱逐我们了
They're evicting us.

1327
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,810
你怎么贷款前不问过我
Why didn't you ask me before?

1328
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,700
我本也会同意的
I would've said yes.

1329
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,980
我从不介意要冒险  但我们一向是共进退
I never minded the risk, but we always did it together.

1330
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,800
就猜到你会跑来这里  自怨自艾
Figured you'd end up here. Feeling sorry for yourself?

1331
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,780
各位  如果你们是来拿工资的
Folks if you've come to get paid,

1332
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,340
没钱了  一个子都没了
the money is gone. All of it.

1333
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,430
-没钱给你们了  -闭嘴吧  巴纳姆
- Nothing left to give you. - Shut up, Barnum.

1334
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,760
你还不懂吗
You just don't get it.

1335
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,270
我们的亲生母亲都嫌我们丢人
Our own mothers were ashamed of us.

1336
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,170
一直把我们藏着掖着
Hid us our whole lives.

1337
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:18,580
然后你把我们从阴影里拽出来
Then you pull us out of the shadows.

1338
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,400
现在你也要放弃我们了
And now you are giving upon us too.

1339
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:24,390
或许你真是个骗子
Maybe you are a fraud.

1340
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:27,320
或许真的只是为了赚钱
Maybe it was just about making a buck.

1341
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,770
但你给了我们一个真正的家庭
But you gave us a real family.

1342
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,930
马戏团
And the circus

1343
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:36,090
就是我们的家园
that was our home.

1344
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,490
我们想要回我们的家
We want our home back.

1345
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,780
看那熠熠日光渐暗
I saw the sun begin to dim

1346
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,460
感到瑟瑟冬风渐起
And felt that winter wind

1347
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,290
吹人冷
Blow cold

1348
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,400
患难才能见真情
A man learns who is there for him

1349
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,350
当浮华褪去  高墙崩塌
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold

1350
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,600
废墟瓦砾之中
'Cause from that rubble

1351
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,060
依然矗立
What remains

1352
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:17,230
必是至真至诚
Can only be what's true

1353
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,230
哪怕千金散尽
If all was lost

1354
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:23,980
也是塞翁失马
There's more I gained

1355
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,900
因为这让我找回了
Cause it led me back

1356
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,610
你
To you

1357
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,140
我曾与国王女王畅饮香槟
I drank champagne with kings and queens

1358
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:58,480
被政客溜须吹捧
The politicians praised my name

1359
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,990
但那是另一个人的梦想
But those were someone else's dreams

1360
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:09,690
是我因忘本而步入的陷阱
The pitfalls of the man I became

1361
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,680
年复一年
For years and years

1362
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,710
我寻求欢呼
I chased their cheers

1363
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,590
疯狂向前不停步  不满足
A crazy speed of always needing more

1364
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,500
但当我驻足
But when I stop

1365
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,510
看到你时
And see you here

1366
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:29,420
才记起这一切本是为了谁
I remember who all this was for

1367
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:32,620
从今后
And from now on

1368
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,520
我的双眼再不会为金光蒙蔽
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights

1369
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:41,500
从今后
From now on

1370
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,360
曾被我推迟的许诺将从今晚开始
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight

1371
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,030
从今晚开始
It starts tonight

1372
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:51,680
我就此许下承诺
And let this promise in me start

1373
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,270
宛如心中的圣歌
Like an anthem in my heart

1374
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:59,280
从今后
From now on

1375
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:05,210
从今后
From now on

1376
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,700
从今后
From now on

1377
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,840
我们还能回归家庭
And we will come back home

1378
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,410
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1379
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:15,300
重回家园
Home, again!

1380
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,730
我们还能回归家庭
And we will come back home

1381
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:20,670
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1382
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,130
重回家园
Home, again!

1383
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:26,620
我们还能回归家庭
And we will come back home

1384
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:29,520
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1385

重回家园
Home, again!

1392
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,830
重回家园
Home, again!

1393
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,320
我们还能回归家庭
And we will come back home

1394
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,410
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1395
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,290
没错
Yes!

1396
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:59,680
重回家园
Home, again!

1397
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:02,260
我们还能回归家庭
And we will come back home

1398
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:05,100
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1399
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,610
重回家园
Home, again!

1400
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,490
从今后
From now on

1401
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:14,400
我的双眼再不会为金光蒙蔽
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights

1402
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:19,440
从今后
From now on

1403
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,310
曾被我推迟的许诺将从今晚开始
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight

1404
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,300
从今晚开始
It starts tonight

1405
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:29,520
我就此许下承诺
Let this promise in me start

1406
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:34,190
宛如心中的圣歌
Like an anthem in my heart

1407
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:38,590
从今后
From now on

1408
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,120
从今后
From now on

1409
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,260
我们还能回归家庭

01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,210
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1411
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:48,630
重回家园
Home, again!

1412
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,190
我们还能回归家庭
And we will come back home

1413
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,980
我们还能找回初心
And we will come back home

1414
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,530
重回家园
Home, again!

1415
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:09,970
你在这儿
You're here.

1416
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,750

01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:15,390

01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,700
从今后
From now on

1420
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:26,400
从今后
From now on

1421
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:30,050
重回家园
Home, again!

1422
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,230
从今后
From now on

1423
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,950
从今后
From now on

1424
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:40,510
重回家园
Home, again!

1425
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:47,040
卡罗琳
Caroline.

1426
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,330
他来了
He's here.

1427
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,360
我想见我妻子
I would like to see my wife.

1428
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,960
她不在这里
She's not here.

1429
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,120
她去海滩了
She's at the beach.

1430
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,320
我给你  给我们的家庭带来了苦难
I have hardship on you and our family.

1431
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:33,310
你提醒过我
You warned me...

1432
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,700
但我没听
and I wouldn't listen.

1433
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,640
我只是
I just...

1434
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,050
我想成为更了不起的人
I wanted to be more than I was.

1435
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:54,450
我一直只想要我当初爱上的那个男人
I never wanted anything but the man I fell in love with.

1436
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,780
我就此许下承诺
Let this promise in me start

1437
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,160
宛如心中的圣歌
Like an anthem in my heart

1438
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:12,820
不管宏大  还是渺小
However big, however small

1439
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,230
从今后
From now on.

1440
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:20,950
从今后
From now on.

1441
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:55,950
银行拒绝了
Bank said no?

1442
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:58,490
断然拒绝  怎么说都没用
Emphatically. Repeatedly.

1443
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,770
我觉得美国不会再有哪家银行
I don't think there's a banker left in the country

1444
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:04,550
会听我哄骗借给我钱了  所以
I can fool into loaning me more money, so...

1445
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,570
很抱歉我让你们失望了
I'm really sorry to disappoint you all.

1446
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,500
别担心  巴纳姆  我们都习惯了
Don't worry, Barnum. We've gotten used to it by now.

1447
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,290
巴纳姆
You know, Barnum,

1448
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,060
我当初认识你时
when I first met you

1449
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,870
我有继承权  声誉
I had an inheritance, acclaim,

1450
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,020
城里所有的派对都愿请我去
an invitation to every party in town.

1451
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:24,870
现在  拜你所赐  那些都不复存在了
And now thanks to you. All that's gone.

1452
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,710
只剩下了友谊  爱情
All that's left is this friendship, love

1453
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,030
和我热爱的事业
and work that I adore.

1454
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:37,600
你为我的生活带来了欢乐
You brought joy into my life.

1455
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:40,110
-对我们所有人都是  -是啊
- Into all our lives. - Hear, hear.

1456
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,320
要是银行肯接受欢乐做抵押就好了
If only the bank would take joy as collateral.

1457
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:45,570
他们或许不接受
They may not...

1458
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:47,620
但我接受
But I will.

1459
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:51,210
我拥有10%的利润
I own 10% of the show.

1460
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:55,040
我清楚我老板的脾气
Knowing who I was working for,

1461
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,570
所以明智地每周去取钱
I had the good sense to take my cut weekly.

1462
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,410
菲利普  我不能允许你赌在我身上
Phillip, I can't let you gamble it on me...

1463
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:02,590
你当然能
Sure you can.

1464
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,550
别现在又理智起来了
Don't turn sensible on us now.

1465
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:07,330
合伙人
Partners.

1466
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,560
五五分成
Fifty fifty.

1467
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,360
合伙人
Partners.

1468
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:26,860
问题是
The only thing is...

1469
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,440
我不知道我们怎么能买得起大楼
I don't know how we're gonna afford a building.

1470
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:31,810
是啊
Right.

1471
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,710
我们不需要楼
Building. We don't need a building.

1472
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,770
在曼哈顿投资地产太不明智了
Real estate in Manhattan is a terrible investment.

1473
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:44,300
我可以花点小钱就在码头附近买到地皮
Why, I can get a land down by the docks for almost nothing.

1474
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,950
我们只需要一个帐篷
All we need is a tent.

1475
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,240
-这是最棒的表演  -快来
- Oh, this is the greatest show - Come on, come on!

1476
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:57,220
气势汹汹  我们这群场内的叛逆者
Colossal we come these renegades in the ring

1477
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:03,210
曾经迷失  如今加冕马戏之王
Where the lost get found and we crown 'em the circus kings

1478
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,480
别再抗拒  它犹如洪流般袭来
Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' atcha

1479
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,540
只在乎此刻  不管之后如何
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after

1480
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:12,580
这炫目的光  是你前所未见的明亮
It's blindin', outshinin' anything thatcha know

1481
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:16,100
投降吧  因为你想来  你向往那里
Just surrender 'cause you're comin' and you wanna go

1482
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:19,260
那被缤纷灯光笼罩的地方
Where it's covered in all the colored lights

1483
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,050
那由流浪儿称雄的地方
Where the runaways are runnin' the night

1484
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:25,120
那不可能变为可能的地方  它让你意乱情迷
Impossible comes true, intoxicatin' you

1485
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,010
这是最棒的表演
Oh, this is the greatest show

1486
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:31,500
我们点亮夜晚  不肯罢休
We light it up, we won't come down

1487
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,240
即使太阳升起也无法阻拦我们
And the sun can't stop us now

1488
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,240
看着梦境成为现实  它让你情不自禁
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you

1489
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,240
这是最棒的表演
Oh, this is the greatest show

1490
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,640
这里有你渴望的一切
It's ev'rythin' you ever want

1491
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,920
这里有你需要的一切
It's ev'rythin' you ever need

1492
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,420
全部摆在了你面前
And it's here right in front of you

1493
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:52,870
这里就是你向往的地方
This is where you wanna be (this is where you wanna be)

1494
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,980
这里有你渴望的一切
It's ev'rythin' you ever want

1495
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:58,910
这里有你需要的一切

1496
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:02,020
全部摆在了你面前

1498
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:07,950
这里就是你向往的地方
This is where you wanna be

1499
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:11,000
那被缤纷灯光笼罩的地方
Where it's covered in all the colored lights

1500
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,650
那由流浪儿称雄的地方
Where the runaways are runnin' the night

1501
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:14,890
那不可能变为可能的地方  它让你情不自禁
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you

1502
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:15,910
这个给你了
This is for you.

1503
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:19,720
这是最棒的表演
Oh, this is the greatest show

1504
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,710
-那你干什么去  -看我女儿长大
- What will you be doing? - Watching my girls grow up.

1505
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,080
演出还得继续
The show must go on.

1506
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,790
我们点亮夜晚  不肯罢休
We light it up, we won't come down

1507
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,540

And the sun can't stop us now

看着梦境成为现实  它让你情不自禁
Watching it come true, it's takin' over you

1509
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:39,840
这是最棒的表演
This is the greatest show

1510
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,780
那被缤纷灯光笼罩的地方
Where it's covered in all the colored lights

1511
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:45,530
那由流浪儿称雄的地方
Where the runaways are runnin' the night

1512
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:48,660
那不可能变为可能的地方  它让你情不自禁

We light it up, we won't come down

1515
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:57,860
高墙再也无法阻隔我们
And the walls can't stop us now

1516
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,970
看着梦境成为现实  它让你情不自禁
I'm watching it come true, it's takin' over you

1517
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:02,790
这是最棒的表演
Oh, this is the greatest show

1518
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:05,700
你渴望的一切尽在眼前
'Cause everything you want is right in front of you

1519
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,760
你看到不可能变为可能
And you see the impossible is coming true

1520
