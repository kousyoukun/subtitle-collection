1
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:18,103
Damn it.

2
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,254
Hello.

3
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,341
Billie, hi this is Rose
Goldstein from next door.

4
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:31,550
I hate to bother
you at this hour,

5
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,802
but I thought I
ought to tell you

6
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:35,078
somebody's stealing
the tires off your car.

7
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,306
What?

8
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:40,184
I said somebody's stealing
the tires off your car!

9
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:41,960
Do you want me to
call the police?

10
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:58,852
Hello Billie, hello?

11
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:08,987
Belinda?

12
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,906
What are you doing?

13
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,551
Turn on the light.

14
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:15,719
Grandpa please,
leave the lights off.

15
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,955
Someone is trying
to steal my wheels.

16
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,129
Okay guys, that's enough.

17
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,110
I said that's enough!

18
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,653
That's my car, just
leave everything

19
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,221
the way it is and get out.

20
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:39,869
Hey bitch, didn't your
daddy ever teach you nothing?

21
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,912
Never bother a man
when he's working.

22
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,540
Just leave now and
nobody will get hurt.

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,109
The only one who's gonna
get bumped here is you.

24
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,048
Hey!

25
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:15,512
Let's get the hell out.

26
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,475
Where have you jerks been?

27
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:48,086
- We had a problem.
- So, what else is new?

28
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:51,815
The problem started
the day you were born.

29
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:54,051
Hey man, we got shot at!

30
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:56,178
Did you get hit?

31
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:58,989
No.

32
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,741
So big deal.

33
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,660
Hey, do you guys mind?

34
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,247
Anyways, it was this old
guy with a gun and some broad.

35
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,791
You guys really can't manage

36
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,542
to take care of
yourselves, can ya?

37
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:11,919
Oh come on, Phil!

38
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,879
You got your asses
kicked by an old man

39
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,489
and a girl, right?

40
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,241
Phil, I gotta take a pee.

41
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,619
So go take a pee.

42
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,038
You bastard!

43
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,085
Who is she?

44
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,814
She's the new Miss
Blow Job of California.

45
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,650
They're holding
nationals next month.

46
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,985
I heard that!

47
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,887
Yeah, and you're lucky I'm
not gonna be one of the judges!

48
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,116
Okay guys, tell
me what happened.

49
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,659
We were ripping
off some tires.

50
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,202
Hey, like you
told us all right.

51
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,746
And then this old man
and some broad come out

52
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:49,540
and they start playing games.

53
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,749
She was in karate.

54
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,793
She was a real tiger.

55
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:53,735
Okay.

56
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:57,364
Since you pussies
can't handle it,

57
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:00,259
I'm gonna show you how.

58
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,928
Tonight we're gonna play
some games with them.

59
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,163
When I get done with that tiger,

60
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,167
she'll be nothing more
than an alley cat.

61
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,522
Tom, you go steal us a car.

62
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:16,859
Not just the tires,
the whole car.

63
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,385
You got it, babe.

64
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,741
And you got it too,
'cause I got the clap.

65
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,202
Hey man, you're late!

66
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:28,222
I don't like waiting!

67
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,765
I didn't see you waiting!

68
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,209
I've been out here honking
for a half an hour!

69
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,068
Drive, asshole!

70
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,316
This is some good
shit, man, it's laced.

71
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,110
You're gonna blow
the whole room, boy.

72
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,946
Hey man, put that shit away!

73
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:26,989
We got work to do!

74
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:27,948
I want your head
on straight 'cause

75
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,850
my ass could depend on it!

76
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,520
Drive, asshole!

77
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,859
We're coming
baby, we're coming.

78
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,296
Adios amigos!

79
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,033
Yeah, drive asshole.

80
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:55,434
That old man
is as good as dead.

81
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,003
The old fart's gonna
get his balls busted.

82
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:19,274
Stupid kids, we
should have kicked ass.

83
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,086
- They're in there.
- Are you sure?

84
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:24,755
I tell you
man, I saw them go in.

85
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:27,049
Wait here, I'll check it out.

86
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,143
Oh hey, I'm sorry.

87
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:39,830
Age before beauty.

88
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,398
Go ahead, please.

89
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:51,700
- How does it look?
- Piece of cake.

90
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,411
Drive, asshole!

91
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:02,185
We should get some wind
soon, maybe some rain.

92
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,254
Wash all this smog
and dirt away.

93
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,440
I like the fall.

94
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:09,676
There they are.

95
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:14,197
All right, old man.

96
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,782
Take it easy and
nobody's gonna get hurt.

97
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,701
Give me your wallet!

98
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,828
I like the watch!

99
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:21,038
Come on, come on!

100
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,873
All right, you got
your old broad's purse?

101
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:24,082
Give me the ring!

102
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:25,500
- That's my ring!
- Don't touch her!

103
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:32,824
Come on come on!

104
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,085
Dr. Swanson,

105
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:10,361
please pick up on line two.

106
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,247
Dr. Swanson, you're
wanted in emergency room.

107
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,893
I'm Belinda Clark.

108
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,270
My grandparents were
brought in here yesterday.

109
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,271
Could you tell-

110
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,064
I'll be with you in a minute.

111
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,340
Just be seated.

112
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:37,322
Of course, I was up
with him last night.

113
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:38,240
Excuse me.

114
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,950
His legs were all over me.

115
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,518
Excuse me.

116
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,704
May I help you?

117
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,580
I'm looking for Kate
and Charlie Clark.

118
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
What department
do they work in?

119
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,999
They don't work here,

120
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,376
they came in here last night.

121
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,002
They were in some
kind of accident.

122
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,380
Hon, I can't give
out that information.

123
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,715
Just be seated and the admitting

124
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,550
clerk will be with
you in a moment.

125
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,534
Right over there.

126
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,310
Oh I'm sorry.

127
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,395
No, no, no, it's okay.

128
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,312
Oh here, let me feel.

129
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:10,439
No, no, no, really, it's okay.

130
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,773
Would you let me-

131
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,066
No I'll just go
down to emergency

132
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,843
and get some ice
and cotton for it.

133
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,238
Look, I am really sorry.

134
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,074
But those assholes down there
were giving me a hard time.

135
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,285
The cop, the police came to

136
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:25,203
my apartment this
morning at three o'clock

137
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,455
and told me that my grandparents

138
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:27,706
had been rushed down here.

139
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:29,416
So I come down here and
nobody in this place

140
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,358
gives a damn.

141
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,045
You're Belinda Clark right?

142
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:36,339
How did you know?

143
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,841
Not balling, bowling.

144
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:39,050
And they went-

145
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,219
Paging Dr. Meldrum.

146
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:42,662
Pick up line 221.

147
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:46,475
Well come on, I'll
show you the way.

148
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:49,770
Calling Dr. Meldrum.

149
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,795
Gramps?

150
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,232
Oh thank God you're all right.

151
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,026
I was so worried.

152
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,360
All they would tell me is that

153
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,071
you were in some
kind of accident.

154
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:00,947
Gramps?

155
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,515
What's the matter?

156
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,809
Katie's hurt bad, baby.

157
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,372
They took her away as
soon as we got here.

158
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,478
Paging, Dr. Adler.

159
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,379
Emergency, Dr. Adler.

160
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh wow, look at your nose.

161
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,035
I'm really sorry.

162
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,372
It looks worse
than it really is.

163
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,457
Listen, I'd be happy
to pay for the damages.

164
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:54,376
Don't worry about this,
the city pays for it.

165
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:56,378
Besides, I told them that a bank

166
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:58,488
robber hit me in the
nose with a bag of loot.

167
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:02,050
How's your grandmother?

168
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,577
Oh, the doctor came
in just after you left.

169
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,081
And he said that
she's still in a coma.

170
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,127
Doesn't know when she's
gonna regain consciousness.

171
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:16,106
I don't know anything.

172
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,508
Can't even get a straight
answer in this place.

173
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:22,487
Hey I get off in an hour.

174
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:24,614
What if you buy me breakfast?

175
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,599
Make my nose feel
a whole lot better.

176
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,452
Thank you, but
I think I'm gonna

177
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,062
have to take a rain check.

178
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,248
I'm gonna let gramps
sleep for a while

179
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:36,167
and then try and
convince him to go home.

180
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,587
Okay, I'll give you a call.

181
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:40,655
You don't have my number.

182
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,740
Oh yes I do.

183
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:44,342
Bye.

184
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,511
You hungry, gramps?

185
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,639
No.

186
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,219
Here, gramps.

187
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,971
I want you to take this medicine

188
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:32,223
and then I want you
to go get some sleep.

189
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,391
I don't pop pills.

190
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,251
I never have and I never will.

191
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,605
Besides, it's only
four in the afternoon.

192
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,315
Gramps, this isn't dope.

193
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:41,608
These are sleeping pills.

194
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,485
If you don't get some sleep
you're gonna get sick.

195
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,928
I've never been
sick a day in my life.

196
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,533
Besides, I don't need a
pill to make me sleep.

197
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,768
Gramps.

198
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:57,940
I love you.

199
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,277
I love you, babe.

200
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,656
It's so good to have you back.

201
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:21,564
We only get 20
to 30% identification.

202
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:25,176
Most people are either
scared or they don't care.

203
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:28,488
God, half this city
must be criminals.

204
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,431
Sounds about right.

205
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:35,870
It's him!

206
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,122
That's him!

207
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:38,999
He's the one in the
store and by the alley.

208
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,917
He has a long record.

209
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:43,086
nineteen arrests,
three convictions,

210
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:47,240
auto theft, armed robbery, and
assault with a deadly weapon.

211
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,592
If I ever get my hands on him,

212
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,470
I'll kill him for what
he did to my Katie.

213
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,681
Don't get upset Charlie.

214
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,040
They'll get him.

215
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:00,103
Eat, eat your sandwich.

216
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,546
Don't let it go to waste.

217
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,858
If they do get him, I
wonder if they'll put him away

218
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,426
or just let him out again.

219
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,136
Yeehaw!

220
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,447
How does
a two bit rookie

221
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:12,657
afford a place like this?

222
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:13,641
Nothing to it.

223
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,535
I sell dope.

224
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,688
It really doesn't
cost that much.

225
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,459
Must be tough to be a cop.

226
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,044
It's a job.

227
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,420
I kinda like it.

228
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,590
Sure, a life filled
with nothing but crime.

229
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,550
Oh it's got it's good points.

230
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,826
Like what?

231
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:35,180
I got to meet you.

232
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,265
You sweet talking devil.

233
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,516
No, I'm serious.

234
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,251
A cop's life is a lonely life.

235
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,963
I mean you work
late, long hours.

236
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,524
You have to deal with
the dregs of society

237
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,259
and you get no thanks.

238
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:50,970
I get real lonely.

239
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,115
Oh my God.

240
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,661
Okay, would you believe horny?

241
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,646
Yes, that I believe.

242
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:07,403
What's the matter?

243
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:09,822
Nothing.

244
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,033
Come on, tell me.

245
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:15,762
I can't help thinking
about my grandmother.

246
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,473
How come people do
things like that?

247
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:19,457
Well,

248
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,376
now you know why I'm a cop.

249
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:26,231
So you think you can
do something about it?

250
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:27,565
What if I could?

251
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,609
Gramps identified one
of them this morning.

252
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,195
He recognized the
scar on his face.

253
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:33,179
Great!

254
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,491
I want those bastards in jail.

255
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:38,618
Look Billie, I'm with you.

256
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,621
But there's a lot of
garbage people out there.

257
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,231
Don't let that hate eat on you.

258
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,316
It'll burn ya out.

259
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,797
It's not safe
around here after dark.

260
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:51,714
He's right, you know.

261
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,508
Something happens every night.

262
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:54,717
I keep a diary.

263
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,011
We've had 20
muggings, three rapes,

264
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,596
five stolen cars-

265
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,807
Look, I've got my black
belt trials coming up

266
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,350
and I gotta keep in shape.

267
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,334
No.

268
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:05,645
Gramps.

269
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:06,629
I'm going.

270
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,881
I'm not a little kid anymore.

271
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,485
Now Rose will stay here
with you until I get back.

272
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:16,531
Okay, okay you can
go if you take a gun.

273
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:17,782
I don't need a gun.

274
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:20,184
If I need a sitter
you need a gun.

275
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,887
No!

276
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,450
No!

277
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,452
♪ Paying the way aunt Susie ♪

278
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:04,412
♪ Paying the way all clay ♪

279
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:06,331

280
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:09,859

281
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,903
Drop the knife.

282
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,280
Get over there.

283
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:06,975
Are you okay, kid?

284
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:08,125
Give her the shirt.

285
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,106
You got a dime, Caruso?

286
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,023
A what?

287
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:15,758
A dime, one tenth of a dollar.

288
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:19,095
Hand it over nice and slow.

289
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,073
There's a phone
over by the lake.

290
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:27,269
Go and call the cops.

291
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,225
Let's go, hands up in the air.

292
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:50,601
Come here.

293
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:52,103
Turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

294
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:53,980
Come on, put 'em down
here by your back.

295
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,922
I got it.

296
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,609
Come on,
come on, come on.

297
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,862
What the hell took you
cops so long to get here?

298
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:03,114
You know we've been
waiting almost two hours?

299
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:04,449
All right, enough of the bullshit.

300
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:06,034
Swinton, you take the
hooker over by the car

301
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:07,327
and you get her story

302
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,579
and I'll take care of
marathon mouth here.

303
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,997
Hey Pete, look I told
you I know this girl.

304
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,790
She's a friend of mine.

305
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,400
All the more reason, rookie.

306
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:16,502
Move it!

307
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,795
I don't believe this!

308
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,547
Put a lid on it, lady.

309
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:21,632
I'll ask the questions, you answer.

310
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:22,383
Get it?

311
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:23,634
Screw you.

312
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:25,762
All right, smart ass.

313
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:26,888
Who's gun is this?

314
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:28,122
Mine.

315
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:30,416
It's my grandfather's.

316
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:35,171
This gun's been
fired, tell me about it.

317
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,691
One came at me with a
knife and I stopped him.

318
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,026
You fired at him?

319
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,010
Got it.

320
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:44,847
Do you have a
permit to carry this weapon?

321
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:52,188
No, I don't have a permit.

322
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,148
Stand up.

323
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,417
Turn around.

324
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:58,961
What, are you shitting me?

325
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:01,047
Turn around
and spread your feet.

326
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,340
Put your hands on the table.

327
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,591
Hey what the hell
are you doing, Boyle?

328
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:04,926
Get your hands off
me, don't ever touch me.

329
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:05,718
Are you nuts?

330
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,952
You can't do this.

331
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,933
Go get me the extra set
of handcuffs in the car.

332
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,976
You're under arrest for
carrying a concealed weapon.

333
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,728
Hey, she just stopped a rape.

334
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,647
She may even have
saved that girl's life.

335
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:19,148
Shut it off, rookie.

336
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,650
Now get me those
handcuffs or I'm gonna

337
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,902
write a report on you
on insubordination.

338
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,029
Carrying a concealed weapon,

339
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:28,032
discharging a firearm
within the city limits,

340
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:31,077
and oh yes, trespassing.

341
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,037
This park closes at 10 o'clock.

342
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:35,498
Boyle, you can't do
this, this isn't right.

343
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,125
Look I'm gonna call the Captain.

344
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,127
You're not gonna
do anything, rookie.

345
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:40,711
You have no power.

346
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:43,113
She broke the law and
she's going to jail.

347
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,265
Pigs keep
a man in this joint.

348
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:14,228
Slip my last shoe
between your legs, Chuck.

349
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,579
All right, let's go.

350
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,881
Wait in here.

351
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,281
Hi Billie, I'm Rey.

352
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,783
Rey?

353
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:12,803
Rey who?

354
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:15,014
I'm your friendly bondsman.

355
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,058
Now you sign on the dotted line

356
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:18,417
and you're home.

357
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:21,062
Wait a minute.

358
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:22,504
What's the catch here?

359
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:25,633
How much is this gonna cost me?

360
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,862
Your friend took care of it.

361
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,782
It's nice to have a friend.

362
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:33,766
Friend?

363
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:36,101
What friend?

364
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:43,042
Lord, we
commend to your kingdom,

365
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:46,946
the soul of our beloved
sister Katherine Clark.

366
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:50,216
May she know this day,

367
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,009
the peace of your presence.

368
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:54,595
And may she know joy with you

369
00:25:54,695 --> 00:25:57,831
as she gave joy to those
she loved here on earth.

370
00:25:58,616 --> 00:25:59,809
Amen.

371
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:02,252
Gramps?

372
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:06,340
Come on, we're home, gramps.

373
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:21,163
Rose, do me a favor
and take him inside.

374
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:22,648
I'll be in in a minute, okay?

375
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:36,721
What do you do
at a time like this?

376
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:37,705
You wait.

377
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:40,916
You wait for the
pain to go away.

378
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:43,460
Wait for the memories to fade.

379
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,273
Do you want me
to stick around?

380
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,382
Maybe I could help?

381
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:58,075
Listen Johnny, I really
appreciate what you did.

382
00:26:58,175 --> 00:26:59,744
With the bail and all.

383
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:02,604
And for coming here today,
it was real sweet of you.

384
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,857
But I need to be alone now.

385
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,234
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:09,503
Goodbye, Johnny.

387
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:10,821
I'll see you in court.

388
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:27,647
- Hey, Phil.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

389
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,649
Awe come on man,
I've got a problem.

390
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,317
I expected that.

391
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,510
Look, can we talk alone?

392
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,780
When you're with her,

393
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,407
you're as alone as
you ever wanna be.

394
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:40,993
Yeah well, the other night,

395
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,953
me and Mickey, we
went into the park

396
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:44,497
and we climbed up on this bitch.

397
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,500
Boy you guys really
manage to stay busy,

398
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,543
don't you?
- Yeah.

399
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:50,878
And you couldn't
get it up right?

400
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:52,296
Yeah.

401
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:53,589
I mean, no.

402
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,175
Look man, we got busted.

403
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,409
Wait a minute.

404
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,620
Over there.

405
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,753
All right, what
the hell happened?

406
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:10,231
It was the same
broad that gave us

407
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:12,149
the rap with the
tires the other night.

408
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:13,734
Swear to God!

409
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,153
It's like she's
all over the place!

410
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:19,240
Anyways, Danny, he
got me out on bail.

411
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,557
But Mickey, he's still in.

412
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,911
We got a court date
day after tomorrow.

413
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:24,745
If that broad testifies-

414
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:26,163
What whore was it?

415
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,107
You know her I think, Karen.

416
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:31,902
Yeah I know her.

417
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,256
So anyways, if
that whore testiﬁes,

418
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:36,615
we go up for a hard pin.

419
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,577
No sweat.

420
00:28:41,362 --> 00:28:44,140
That fat ass bitch ain't
gonna show up in court.

421
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,874
I can assure you of that.

422
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,335
Okay, thanks man.

423
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,796
But you owe me, Tom.

424
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,566
You owe me big for this one.

425
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,401
Sure Phil, sure.

426
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:56,718
Anything you say.

427
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,282
Oh, that idiot at the store

428
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:05,286
acts like these boxes
are made out of gold!

429
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:07,371
He only wanted to give me two.

430
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:10,274
But I got four, but I had
to beg and then threaten.

431
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,797
Can you imagine the
nerve of that guy?

432
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:18,758
I know he has at
least 40 empty boxes

433
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,118
stacked up in that
back room of his!

434
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:25,080
I saw them.

435
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:28,625
Hey.

436
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:33,314
Hey, Billie, it's
gonna be all right.

437
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,924
Oh, it's gonna be all right.

438
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,385
It's not fair.

439
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,891
It's just not fair.

440
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,369
They're the sweetest
people in the world,

441
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:48,979
they wouldn't hurt a ﬂy.

442
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,067
Billie.

443
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:56,945
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

444
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,460
Hey, wait a minute!

445
00:30:12,786 --> 00:30:14,087
Hold on, wait up!

446
00:30:16,332 --> 00:30:17,900
What are you, stuck
up or something?

447
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,443
Just leave me alone.

448
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:21,845
Boy, sure sound stuck up.

449
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,826
Now look, why don't we

450
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,245
go have dinner or something?

451
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:30,996
I just wanna be left alone.

452
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,331
Okay?

453
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,251
Hey sweetheart, I'm not
talking marriage here.

454
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:37,527
Just talking
dinner, no big deal.

455
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,426
All right then a malted milk.

456
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,470
You look like the healthy type.

457
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,497
You stay the
hell away from me!

458
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:07,908
You know, you got great tits.

459
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,851
I can feel them
against my chest.

460
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:11,979
Please don't hurt me.

461
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,415
Do I look like the kind of guy

462
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:16,942
that would hurt a woman?

463
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:22,423
Look, I didn't
mean to insult you.

464
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,133
Just don't hurt me.

465
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:28,161
I'm a great big pussycat.

466
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,791
You ever had anyone bash
a fist into your face?

467
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,752
Break your nose,
bust your teeth?

468
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,357
It's up to you, babe.

469
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:42,884
First I'll get a look
at those big tits.

470
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:54,354
Get up!

471
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:06,258
You know something, pussycat,

472
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,593
you ought to stay
out of the park.

473
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,745
It's bad for your health.

474
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:21,190
Yeah, it's just like I
was telling you, rookie.

475
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,734
You're never gonna make
it through to probation.

476
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,636
You just don't have the right
attitude about your work.

477
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,490
You know, just because
your old man was a cop

478
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,824
you think you've got it made.

479
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,242
You can say all
you want about me

480
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:34,078
but just leave my father alone!

481
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,689
Hey, pull a U-turn.

482
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,692
I wanna talk to that
hooker right over there.

483
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,497
Hey listen, I'm gonna
check out a complaint

484
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,124
up here in this building.

485
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,876
You cruise around here
close, you understand?

486
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:24,586
Now if we get a call,
come on back here

487
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:25,713
and blow on the
siren a little bit.

488
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:26,797
Right here.

489
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:27,781
You got it?

490
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:30,867
Yeah,
I got it, Boyle.

491
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,765
Well, your honor, in
my considered opinion,

492
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,393
the defendant used the
weapon in self defense.

493
00:33:39,493 --> 00:33:41,103
May I point out, your
honor, that my client was

494
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,605
actually aiding the law by
making a citizens arrest

495
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:46,400
and halting the perpetration
of a crime in progress?

496
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,610
I am well aware of the
circumstances, counselor.

497
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,112
If I need any conclusions drawn,

498
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,864
I'll draw them myself.

499
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,491
Why is Officer Boyle not
present in court this morning?

500
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,744
He's off duty with
the flu your honor.

501
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:58,704
Your honor, you do
have Ofﬁcer Boyle's

502
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,039
written report in
your briefing file.

503
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,166
Now tell me, Officer Swinton,

504
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:04,043
why is it that your
version of the incident

505
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,669
differs so dramatically
from Officer Boyle's

506
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:07,296
written statement?

507
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:09,548
If Officer Boyle were here
he would ask for leniency.

508
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,592
Quite the contrary
Officer Swinton.

509
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,343
Officer Boyle's
notation under remarks

510
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:15,554
ask for full enforcement
to the statutes.

511
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,348
What do you have to say,
Mr. District Attorney?

512
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:22,019
Well your honor,

513
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,563
she, the defendant,

514
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:27,941
did in fact halt a
crime in progress.

515
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:32,237
But she did break the
law on several counts.

516
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:36,241
And the statutes
are very specific

517
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:40,120
on these offenses.

518
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,622
Thank you for your inspiring

519
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,665
and enlightening contribution.

520
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:44,833
Counselor, it is my
understanding that

521
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,460
your client wishes to wave jury

522
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,295
and throw herself on
the mercy of the court?

523
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,339
Yes, your honor,
that is correct.

524
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,466
Well you're in
luck, counselor.

525
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:55,302
Due to Officer Swinton's
favorable testimony,

526
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:56,970
the District Attorney's
lack of preparedness

527
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,765
and poor presentation,
and because I do feel

528
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,725
merciful today,
the court finds the

529
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:04,603
defendant guilty as
charged and poses

530
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,106
a $500 fine in lieu
of incarceration,

531
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,900
and places the defendant
on one year probation.

532
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,985
However, let me warn
you, young lady,

533
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,779
if you ever appear
before me again

534
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,531
for any violation,
you'll get the

535
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:17,783
maximum sentence allowed by law.

536
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:19,576
Next case.

537
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:20,744
That son of a bitch!

538
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:22,562
That lousy son of a bitch!

539
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,666
Look, this doesn't look
good kid, I'm in uniform.

540
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,376
Even if I am off duty.

541
00:35:27,476 --> 00:35:29,795
Listen, I'm gonna let you
in on a deep dark secret.

542
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,673
In my off duty hours
I'm learning karate.

543
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,383
How about if we go
down to the studio

544
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,826
and I'll show you how I
work out my aggressions?

545
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,304
Maybe
afterwards I'll show you

546
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,705
how I work out mine.

547
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,941
Come on, I wanna show
you some of my moves.

548
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:51,925
Tony.

549
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:26,376
Whenever you're ready.

550
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:55,238
I think I've been had.

551
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:39,115
Johnny?

552
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,743
Are you all right?

553
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:05,784
Okay, it's all yours.

554
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,727
You're still wet.

555
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,206
ls there a shower cap in here?

556
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:12,082
There used to be
a little plastic one

557
00:38:12,182 --> 00:38:13,000
in the cupboard there.

558
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,484
Brought it back from Vegas.

559
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:17,796
You're a gambler?

560
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,339
Nickel slots sometimes.

561
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,990
I went there for a wedding.

562
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:24,035
Ah, forget it.

563
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,128
Hey!

564
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:00,172
Where are the towels?

565
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:02,031
They're in
the cupboard in the hall.

566
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,801
Would you bring one in here?

567
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,136
You wouldn't want
me to get the carpet

568
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:08,121
any wetter than it is!

569
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:23,928
Thanks.

570
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:42,530
Champagne.

571
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:48,870
How nice.

572
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,039
Thank you.

573
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:23,083
Shh, be quiet!

574
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:24,233
Be very quiet.

575
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:36,179
I don't think you should
appear in court, do you?

576
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:37,180
Do you?

577
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:59,060
Now for being so good,

578
00:43:03,223 --> 00:43:06,359
I'm gonna give you
a little treat.

579
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,213
Take it out, bitch!

580
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:24,711
The people versus
Gouger and Vernon.

581
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:41,161
Randolf Gouger
and Thomas Vernon, you are

582
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:44,331
accused of rape, trespassing
and intoxication.

583
00:43:44,431 --> 00:43:45,540
How do you plead?

584
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,168
Your honor, I
would like to request

585
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:52,297
that these proceedings be
postponed until a later date.

586
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,423
Why do you
ask for a postponement

587
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:55,467
at this time, Mr. Strickland?

588
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,326
Well, um,

589
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:02,140
see, your honor, my key witness

590
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,709
has failed to appear.

591
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,728
Mr. Strickland
why is it you're

592
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:09,064
always a clay late
and a dollar short!

593
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:10,673
Now counsel, approach the bench.

594
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:14,486
Mr. Strickland, why is it you're

595
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:15,945
never prepared for court?

596
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:17,405
Well your honor I am prepared.

597
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:20,325
It's just that my
client has failed to-

598
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:22,202
Never mind, I really
don't wanna hear it.

599
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:23,411
Mr. Grossman, do you
have any objection

600
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:24,621
to setting a later date?

601
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:26,081
Yes sir, your honor, I do.

602
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:27,874
It has come to my
attention that the witness,

603
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:29,793
that the district
attorney's witness,

604
00:44:29,893 --> 00:44:31,795
has stated that she would
like to drop the charges

605
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:33,797
and that she has left town.

606
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:35,423
Mr. Strickland?

607
00:44:35,523 --> 00:44:37,842
Well, yeah I mean,

608
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,136
Ms. Stride did
call me and tell me

609
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,429
she was leaving town.

610
00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:42,371
But,

611
00:44:43,656 --> 00:44:46,184
well see, I kinda thought
she'd change her mind.

612
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,894
I do not understand,
Mr. Strickland, how it is

613
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:48,812
you're able to hold your job,

614
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:51,231
but I intend to find out.

615
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:53,441
Mr. Grossman, what are the
intentions of your clients?

616
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,360
To save the court
time your honor,

617
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,362
they will plead guilty
to the two lesser charges

618
00:44:57,462 --> 00:45:00,365
if the district attorney
will drop the rape charge.

619
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:01,574
What the hell?

620
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:03,284
The DA is in trouble
with the judge.

621
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:05,370
We'll ﬁnd out in a minute.

622
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,287
Yes, your honor.

623
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:09,082
Yes, that will be acceptable.

624
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:10,066
Thank you.

625
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,045
Postpone of these
procedures is denied.

626
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,339
The prosecution has
dropped the charge of rape.

627
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:19,134
The charges are now
trespassing and intoxication.

628
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:21,077
Randolf Gouger,
how do you plead?

629
00:45:22,362 --> 00:45:25,432
Guilty, to drunk
and trespassing, sir.

630
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:26,224
What the hell?

631
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,851
He made a deal.

632
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:29,185
Thomas Vernon,
how do you plead?

633
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:32,021
Guilty your honor
to intoxication

634
00:45:32,121 --> 00:45:33,398
and trespassing, sir.

635
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,150
What deal?

636
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,776
$250 fine for each
defendant in lieu

637
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:39,112
of 30 days incarceration.

638
00:45:39,212 --> 00:45:42,073
Court is recessed until two p.m.

639
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:43,992
What the hell
is going on here?

640
00:45:44,092 --> 00:45:45,744
What kind of justice if this?

641
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:49,664
I stop a rape I get a $500
fine and six months probation!

642
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:54,335
And these assholes rape a
girl and they get a $250 fine?

643
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:55,462
What Shit!

644
00:45:55,562 --> 00:45:57,321
Bailiff, restrain that woman!

645
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:01,217
Don't do it Billie, you're
already in enough trouble.

646
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:03,636
Bailiff, place that
woman under arrest

647
00:46:03,736 --> 00:46:05,221
on charges of contempt
and hold her in custody.

648
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:07,056
You're gonna do time
for this outrage!

649
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:08,875
Oh you can shove
it up your ass!

650
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,423
Hey, Johnny boy.

651
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,111
You know, she shouldn't
have done that.

652
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:29,871
You know Judge
Taylor's gonna give

653
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:33,666
her at least 30 days.

654
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:35,710
Leave me alone, Boyle.

655
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,653
Just leave me alone, Boyle.

656
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:45,303
You know, it's not my fault
your girlfriend's stupid!

657
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:46,930
She's got a big mouth!

658
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,123
You know you should
have shoved your-

659
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,464
You're gonna pay for this.

660
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:33,643
Here, enjoy this, rookie!

661
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:42,277
Enough!

662
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,108
All right, enough.

663
00:48:19,122 --> 00:48:21,608
You did that on
purpose, that's a foul!

664
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:24,944
No I didn't, she was on
the wrong side of the net.

665
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:26,362
It's our ball.

666
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:27,155
Bullshit!

667
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:28,531
Give me the ball!

668
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:30,199
Keep it down Sam, you're
gonna get the guards on us.

669
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:32,201
Forget about it, it's okay.

670
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:33,912
It all works out in the end.

671
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,455
Your ball.

672
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:36,397
Let's go.

673
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:47,634
Watch out!

674
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,383
Don't touch her,
she's my friend.

675
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:07,570
Turn it up, girls,

676
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,347
you've got five more minutes.

677
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:20,941
You handled yourself
real well with that lady.

678
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:24,737
You really know
that karate stuff?

679
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:28,824
I can take care of myself.

680
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:31,702
The bastard helped me anyway.

681
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,005
If you punch someone
don't get caught.

682
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:44,882
If you get caught,

683
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:48,969
you'll lose all your privileges.

684
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:53,224
And they put you in a
cell all by yourself.

685
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:59,730
And it gets damn lonely
in there by yourself.

686
00:50:05,061 --> 00:50:06,654
You got nice hair.

687
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:10,741
Here, use some of my shampoo.

688
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:21,085
Yup, sure got nice hair.

689
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:31,220
Belinda Clark,
you have a visitor.

690
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:51,466
- Hi.
- You shouldn't be seen here.

691
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:53,033
You might ruin your reputation.

692
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:56,888
How is it?

693
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:57,830
Are you okay?

694
00:50:58,573 --> 00:50:59,932
It's wonderful.

695
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:01,559
Couldn't be better.

696
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,063
Remember all those garbage
people you were talking about?

697
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,440
Between you and me, most
of them live in here.

698
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,424
Full-time.

699
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:12,361
Billie, I've got an angle
that may get you out early.

700
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:13,654
I'll let you know.

701
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:15,990
Listen pal, get me
out of this joint,

702
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,808
I'll give you my body.

703
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,062
That's bribery.

704
00:51:23,055 --> 00:51:26,025
Awe hell, I thought
it was prostitution.

705
00:51:28,811 --> 00:51:30,654
I just want you to be careful.

706
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:33,949
I feel very close to this now.

707
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:37,261
Seeing more and
more of these people

708
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:39,388
and liking it less and less.

709
00:51:39,488 --> 00:51:40,372
Marry me.

710
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,184
You know, I'm worried
about a lot of things.

711
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:45,419
About me if I get
pushed too far.

712
00:51:46,454 --> 00:51:48,756
About you if some dumb
ass takes a shot at you.

713
00:51:49,498 --> 00:51:50,566
Marry me.

714
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,193
I'm worried about
guys who wanna marry me

715
00:51:52,293 --> 00:51:55,071
without knowing what
they're getting into.

716
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:57,657
I think I have a
pretty good idea.

717
00:51:57,757 --> 00:51:59,158
I know your type.

718
00:51:59,258 --> 00:52:01,536
Every time you get laid
you wanna get married.

719
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:02,520
Not really.

720
00:52:03,763 --> 00:52:05,998
I've had over
3,000 conquests and

721
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:08,709
I've only proposed to half.

722
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,404
Listen, Johnny, I don't think
I can love anyone right now.

723
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:14,990
Not like I should.

724
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,867
It's okay.

725
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:19,745
I'll hang around.

726
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,123
Then again, maybe
I could learn.

727
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:56,716
Here, let me
help you with that.

728
00:52:56,816 --> 00:52:58,551
Oh, it's okay.

729
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:00,052
I can do it myself.

730
00:53:00,152 --> 00:53:02,722
It's okay, I used
to be a hairdresser.

731
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:03,914
I need the practice.

732
00:53:08,077 --> 00:53:09,295
You got a boyfriend?

733
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:11,714
Yes.

734
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,467
He asked me to marry him.

735
00:53:17,753 --> 00:53:18,846
Do you miss him?

736
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:24,143
I try not to think about it.

737
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:31,250
It gets lonesome
in here, babe.

738
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,651
Real lonesome.

739
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,298
God, you're tense.

740
00:53:37,398 --> 00:53:39,033
Here, let me give
you a back rub.

741
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,578
I used to be a masseuse too.

742
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:50,686
Thank you Sam, that
feels a lot better.

743
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:52,087
Relax, baby.

744
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:55,716
I'm not gonna hurt you.

745
00:53:56,751 --> 00:53:58,052
I love you.

746
00:54:00,087 --> 00:54:01,864
Stop it, Sam.

747
00:54:01,964 --> 00:54:02,990
That's enough.

748
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:03,974
Just let me go.

749
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:07,102
Just relax, baby.

750
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,065
Just relax and enjoy it.

751
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:17,946
That's enough!

752
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:19,757
No, baby.

753
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,242
What Sam wants, Sam gets.

754
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:26,080
And Sam wants you.

755
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,810
Don't do this, Sam.

756
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,044
You're making a mistake!

757
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:45,557
Don't you dare try that again.

758
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:49,620
Judge Taylor,
I'm John Swinton.

759
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,913
I've been trying to see you.

760
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:52,832
Oh yes Ofﬁcer Swinton,
I know who you are.

761
00:54:52,932 --> 00:54:54,583
You have to excuse
me, I'm in a hurry.

762
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:56,002
Judge please, just for
a moment of your time.

763
00:54:56,102 --> 00:54:57,837
I told you, I'm in a
hurry I don't have a moment.

764
00:54:57,937 --> 00:55:00,423
Judge Taylor, as a
voting tax paying citizen

765
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:01,924
who pays your wages
I'm asking you

766
00:55:02,024 --> 00:55:03,259
for one moment of your time!

767
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,552
All right, Mr. Swinton, a moment.

768
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:05,886
Please be brief
and to the point.

769
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:07,138
Thank you, judge.

770
00:55:07,238 --> 00:55:08,556
I have two entirely
separate matters

771
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,057
I would like to
discuss with you.

772
00:55:10,157 --> 00:55:11,767
The ﬁrst is about
Belinda Clark.

773
00:55:11,867 --> 00:55:14,437
The girl you sentenced
for contempt of court.

774
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:15,896
Her grandfather's very ill.

775
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:17,315
Probably dying.

776
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:18,858
Now I'd like to
ask you to use your

777
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,735
power and influence
to have her released.

778
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:22,403
You're wasting my
time and your energy

779
00:55:22,503 --> 00:55:23,654
on an incorrigible.

780
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:24,405
That girl cannot
stay out of trouble

781
00:55:24,505 --> 00:55:25,197
even when she's in jail.

782
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:26,181
Next subject!

783
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:29,618
Judge, please reconsider, it
may save the old man's life.

784
00:55:29,718 --> 00:55:30,786
You have my decision.

785
00:55:30,886 --> 00:55:32,371
The matter is not open
to further discussion.

786
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:33,873
I was warned I might
be wasting my time.

787
00:55:33,973 --> 00:55:35,333
All right.

788
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,250
Second subject.

789
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,626
Be brief.

790
00:55:37,726 --> 00:55:38,986
I intend to be brief.

791
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,005
I understand that
you're seeking another

792
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,757
term on the bench in
the upcoming election.

793
00:55:42,857 --> 00:55:43,741
Yes.

794
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:46,844
Well, I have here a
rather comprehensive dossier

795
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:50,139
on not only your questionable
decisions from the bench,

796
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:52,600
but also very
complete and detailed

797
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,311
profile on your rather
kinky personal life.

798
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:56,295
Blackmail?

799
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:59,857
Blackmail's a serious
business, Mr. Swinton.

800
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,609
This can hardly be termed
blackmail, Judge Taylor.

801
00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:03,444
I have not yet
offered to exchange

802
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:05,179
the material for money or favor.

803
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:08,574
Officer Swinton, John,

804
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:11,035
perhaps tempers have
been a bit short today.

805
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,578
I suggest that we meet tomorrow

806
00:56:12,678 --> 00:56:14,955
and discuss these matters.

807
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:16,374
Bribery?

808
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,609
Bribery's a serious
matter, Judge Taylor.

809
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:20,778
I'll see you in court.

810
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:22,696
Who knows?

811
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,283
I may even see you in jail.

812
00:56:28,402 --> 00:56:30,120
Have a good day, your honor.

813
00:56:35,743 --> 00:56:38,086
Okay Clark, you're
being released.

814
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:44,968
Yeah, come on.

815
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:48,030
So long, kid.

816
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,615
Still love your hair.

817
00:56:49,715 --> 00:56:50,908
Goodbye, Sam.

818
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,076
Good luck!

819
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:53,077
Don't forget to call my mom.

820
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:53,869
You got the number?

821
00:56:53,969 --> 00:56:55,204
I got it.

822
00:56:55,304 --> 00:56:58,958
Bye Billie,
it's gonna be a hot time!

823
00:56:59,058 --> 00:57:01,443
- Good luck!
- Goodbye, Billie.

824
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:03,821
Goodbye, suckers.

825
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:22,256
Marry me.

826
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:26,134
There you go again.

827
00:57:27,503 --> 00:57:30,097
Every time you get laid
you wanna get married.

828
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:32,182
Billie, I'm serious.

829
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:36,270
So am I.

830
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:39,106
I need time.

831
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:48,907
Move in with me then.

832
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:51,285
We'll live in sin.

833
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:54,079
Now you're cooking.

834
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:58,667
This sure as hell beats jail.

835
00:58:00,202 --> 00:58:02,688
I consider that a compliment.

836
00:58:02,788 --> 00:58:04,882
You sure as hell
beat my old cellmate.

837
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,944
I wouldn't touch that
with a 10 foot pole.

838
00:58:09,044 --> 00:58:10,696
Look, I gotta go.

839
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:11,680
What?

840
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:14,074
You told me you
wanted me to arrest

841
00:58:14,174 --> 00:58:16,118
the scum that murdered
your grandmother.

842
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:18,120
Johnny, what do you know?

843
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,705
I know I love you.

844
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,916
What do you know?

845
00:58:22,016 --> 00:58:22,983
Not much.

846
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:26,086
A few weeks ago I was
out with my ex-partner.

847
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:28,297
You know, Boyle the big bad ass?

848
00:58:28,397 --> 00:58:29,423
Well, he was involved
with a hooker

849
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:30,991
and I tried to set him up.

850
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,761
ls this gonna be a long story?

851
00:58:33,861 --> 00:58:34,745
No.

852
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:37,306
So I checked her out.

853
00:58:37,406 --> 00:58:39,934
Turns out she has
nothing to do with Boyle.

854
00:58:40,034 --> 00:58:41,185
But her ﬁle did
show that she was

855
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:44,313
once arrested with a guy
with a scar on his face.

856
00:58:44,413 --> 00:58:46,190
Prints and everything match up.

857
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,149
His name is Croug right?

858
00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:48,484
Right.

859
00:58:48,584 --> 00:58:49,652
So I thought I'd go
have a talk with her.

860
00:58:49,752 --> 00:58:50,736
Take me!

861
00:58:50,836 --> 00:58:52,112
No way.

862
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:53,781
This one is mine.

863
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,407
Miss Whore is
gonna show me where

864
00:58:55,507 --> 00:58:57,326
he and his buddies hang out.

865
00:58:57,426 --> 00:58:59,394
Okay, ﬁne.

866
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:01,705
Hey, why don't you
get some of your stuff

867
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:02,898
and come by tonight.

868
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:04,917
I work the late shift,

869
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:06,193
I'll be home around midnight.

870
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,006
We got a deal, right?

871
00:59:11,106 --> 00:59:12,240
You bet.

872
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:32,695
50 bucks, are you kidding me?

873
00:59:32,795 --> 00:59:33,679
20 bucks.

874
00:59:36,048 --> 00:59:37,074
25, babe.

875
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,017
That's only because you're cute.

876
00:59:57,069 --> 00:59:59,287
I like to screw to music.

877
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,793
There's a beer in the
ref ridge if you're thirsty.

878
01:00:05,786 --> 01:00:07,938
I usually save that
for my $50 customers,

879
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,966
but like I said, you're cute.

880
01:00:13,168 --> 01:00:15,512
You can put your
clothes on the couch.

881
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,436
You're shy?

882
01:00:25,347 --> 01:00:28,834
Want me to take your
clothes off for you?

883
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:29,776
Oh Shit.

884
01:00:33,188 --> 01:00:34,548
Hey, look you're
just a little kinky.

885
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:35,657
Sorry, lady.

886
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,483
Who put you on to me?

887
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:53,633
A narc, huh?

888
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,622
Leave it alone.

889
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:08,315
Don't make a sound.

890
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,356
Hey, I'm thirsty.

891
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:33,924
Can I have a beer?

892
01:02:04,905 --> 01:02:06,682
Well, well, well.

893
01:02:06,782 --> 01:02:09,101
You son of a bitch!

894
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:10,085
God.

895
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:16,341
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

896
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:19,094
You gonna bust me or not?

897
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:20,946
You a cop?

898
01:02:21,046 --> 01:02:22,197
Show me some ID if you're a cop.

899
01:02:22,297 --> 01:02:23,782
I'm not showing you anything!

900
01:02:23,882 --> 01:02:25,325
So why don't you
just shut your face

901
01:02:25,425 --> 01:02:27,686
and keep it shut, you got it!

902
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:33,817
Okay, baby.

903
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,735
Come on over here.

904
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:38,672
There's plenty of room

905
01:02:38,772 --> 01:02:41,449
and I don't like sleeping alone.

906
01:02:43,569 --> 01:02:44,578
Come on.

907
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,891
I'll make it good for you.

908
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:51,626
- Forget it, lady.
- Asshole.

909
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:13,957
Hey bear, would you
look at that shit?

910
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,375
Let's do it.

911
01:03:27,738 --> 01:03:29,306
Hey, honey.

912
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,308
How abouts some real exercise?

913
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:32,459
Oh screw off.

914
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,559
Come on.

915
01:04:00,145 --> 01:04:01,713
Hey, bitch!

916
01:04:01,813 --> 01:04:03,406
Where the hell are you?

917
01:04:11,698 --> 01:04:14,793
I thought you
boys wanted to play?

918
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:17,420
Come on!

919
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,126
Please, please,
give me a break.

920
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:01,256
I need a fix.

921
01:05:03,959 --> 01:05:04,968
Anything.

922
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:10,390
Please, don't make me wait.

923
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,534
All right.

924
01:05:12,634 --> 01:05:14,185
Now you and I can make a deal.

925
01:05:15,053 --> 01:05:16,663
I want some information
and you're just

926
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:18,690
the person who
can give it to me.

927
01:05:19,474 --> 01:05:21,359
That makes us a very good team.

928
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:24,087
So let's talk.

929
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:28,575
Mark!

930
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:36,016
Where you at, Mark?

931
01:05:36,116 --> 01:05:37,000
Mark!

932
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:45,067
Mark, Mark, where
the hell are ya?

933
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:46,634
He's busy bleeding.

934
01:05:47,627 --> 01:05:50,305
Okay tough guy, let's
see what you can do.

935
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:56,370
Come on, do it scumbag!

936
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,454
Who the hell are you?

937
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,747
Oh, I'm the girl
you and your buddy

938
01:05:58,847 --> 01:06:01,416
chased into the park, remember?

939
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:10,658
Mark, Mark, where
the hell are you?

940
01:06:16,323 --> 01:06:17,265
What the hell is this?

941
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:18,642
Beats me.

942
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:20,477
You and your buddy
jump out of your car

943
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:22,437
and chase me into
the park, right?

944
01:06:22,537 --> 01:06:24,064
Hey man, that was him.

945
01:06:24,164 --> 01:06:24,982
I didn't wanna do nothing.

946
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:26,716
What's the matter with you?

947
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:30,487
Didn't your mommy ever
tell you that isn't nice?

948
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:38,144
Don't mess with
girls in the park!

949
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:41,248
That's not nice!

950
01:06:44,476 --> 01:06:46,778
Shit, crazy bitch.

951
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:52,467
Hey, where were you?

952
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:53,969
I was out by the pool.

953
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:55,262
Oh I couldn't find you.

954
01:06:55,362 --> 01:06:57,139
Look, I gotta go, I
gotta get on duty.

955
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:58,432
Did you find out anything?

956
01:06:58,532 --> 01:06:59,349
You bet.

957
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,767
She talked her brains out.

958
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:02,394
This weekend you
and I we go down

959
01:07:02,494 --> 01:07:04,104
and stake out the place.

960
01:07:04,204 --> 01:07:05,647
If we find them,

961
01:07:05,747 --> 01:07:07,149
I call the department.

962
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:08,984
They get arrested.

963
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:11,570
And I make the
collar for the bust.

964
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,696
Well, then they make me captain

965
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,389
of the detective department.

966
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,659
So then we take all that
money that I've made

967
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:21,538
and we go and buy a
condo by the ocean.

968
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:22,689
And we get married.

969
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:25,542
Have a few kids.

970
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:28,820
And then, then
when I'm about 50,

971
01:07:29,437 --> 01:07:31,256
I retire.

972
01:07:31,356 --> 01:07:33,783
We buy a ranch and a horse.

973
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:37,554
The great American dream, yeah.

974
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:38,597
What a cop.

975
01:07:38,697 --> 01:07:40,724
Well thank you my darling.

976
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:41,708
Mmm.

977
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:46,521
Hey look, you stay
inside tonight.

978
01:07:46,621 --> 01:07:48,607
There's a lot of bad
people out there.

979
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:50,300
I'm gonna catch 'em all tonight.

980
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,736
Where do these guys hang out?

981
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,446
They have a
place at 6th and San Pedro.

982
01:07:54,546 --> 01:07:55,572
Right around the
corner from a place

983
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:56,698
called Charlies.

984
01:07:56,798 --> 01:07:58,158
I'll see you in the morning.

985
01:07:58,258 --> 01:08:00,035
Breakfast in bed, right?

986
01:08:00,135 --> 01:08:00,977
I love it.

987
01:08:45,263 --> 01:08:47,958
Aw, God damn it, shit!

988
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:49,234
Not her again!

989
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,713
Come on, come on.

990
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:56,591
Come on man we can
take care of her.

991
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:09,020
You're doing great,
you're doing great, yeah.

992
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,231
Come on get her.

993
01:10:23,278 --> 01:10:28,499
♪ Look at my position ♪

994
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:32,462
♪ You know I haven't seen ♪

995
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:43,990
Hi there.

996
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,960
Oh man, check this.

997
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:04,577
Oh Shit!

998
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:19,025
Out of the way!

999
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:22,112
Hey, hey lady, that's enough!

1000
01:11:37,143 --> 01:11:38,878
This guy had friends.

1001
01:11:38,978 --> 01:11:39,921
I need a doctor.

1002
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:41,006
Where are his friends?

1003
01:11:41,106 --> 01:11:42,590
Where do they live?

1004
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,550
Somebody help me!

1005
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,676
Oh I'll help you.

1006
01:11:44,776 --> 01:11:46,469
Where are his friends?

1007
01:11:49,614 --> 01:11:51,249
Okay, you got it.

1008
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,728
They're pushing coke down
by the old Troy Park.

1009
01:11:54,828 --> 01:11:57,171
Got an old car staked out
waiting for customers.

1010
01:11:58,873 --> 01:12:01,192
Man, you're gonna
get us into a jam.

1011
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:02,944
You're gonna get us busted.

1012
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:04,654
We're no where near where
we're supposed to be.

1013
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:05,572
Don't worry about it.

1014
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:07,449
I'll take the responsibility.

1015
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:08,825
Now stop complaining
and start looking.

1016
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:09,993
The sooner we find
her the sooner

1017
01:12:10,093 --> 01:12:11,310
we can get back to our beat.

1018
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,039
Oh man, we're
never gonna find her,

1019
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:15,790
she could be anywhere.

1020
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:01,961
It won't take a minute.

1021
01:13:02,061 --> 01:13:03,338
This is her grandparents' house.

1022
01:13:03,438 --> 01:13:04,631
All right, how long has it been

1023
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:05,840
since you last talked to her?

1024
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,883
This afternoon,
before I left for work.

1025
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:09,160
She's been crying
but she seemed okay.

1026
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:12,555
Billie, Billie
open up, it's John!

1027
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:13,890
Billie!

1028
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,933
What's the matter,
what's the problem?

1029
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:16,059
Oh she may be in trouble.

1030
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,310
Billie!

1031
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,770
I told her I'd
be home before dark

1032
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,814
but I had to work
overtime, I need the money.

1033
01:13:20,914 --> 01:13:22,107
John, come on,
we're not in our district.

1034
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:23,024
I looked
at all the windows.

1035
01:13:23,124 --> 01:13:25,235
I went home and tried calling!

1036
01:13:29,964 --> 01:13:31,074
Billie!

1037
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:32,951
Billie, where are you?

1038
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:34,185
Billie?

1039
01:13:38,056 --> 01:13:39,232
She's not here.

1040
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:46,256
It's like she's roaming
all over town, man,

1041
01:13:46,356 --> 01:13:47,406
looking for people.

1042
01:13:48,441 --> 01:13:49,450
She's crazy.

1043
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,036
This town's crazy.

1044
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,764
This town's getting dangerous.

1045
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,099
Shut up.

1046
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,267
Hey, I'm serious, man.

1047
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:59,252
So am I, shut up.

1048
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:05,466
Jack said he saw
her here last night.

1049
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:08,528
She's looking for
it man, you know?

1050
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:09,779
I know.

1051
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:11,030
She's gonna get it,

1052
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:13,015
'cause I'm getting
fed up with this shit.

1053
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,327
Man, would
you look at that?

1054
01:14:16,427 --> 01:14:18,604
These old broads
will never learn.

1055
01:14:19,597 --> 01:14:21,232
Yeah, hold on a second, Phil.

1056
01:14:22,016 --> 01:14:23,460
That's her, man.

1057
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,199
That's her.

1058
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:33,160
Well, buddy,

1059
01:14:34,195 --> 01:14:36,289
now you're gonna
get your chance.

1060
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,292
Let's do it.

1061
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:48,151
Here pussy,
Pussy, pussy.

1062
01:14:58,344 --> 01:15:00,229
Come on, alley cat!

1063
01:15:12,066 --> 01:15:14,285
Go around back!

1064
01:18:19,504 --> 01:18:23,432
I decided, you're
not a very nice person.

1065
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:15,168
Now you need to get this
checked in a couple of days.

1066
01:19:15,268 --> 01:19:16,210
Now you can come back here

1067
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,212
or you can go see
your own doctor.

1068
01:19:18,312 --> 01:19:19,488
Thanks a lot, doc.

1069
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:31,000
You can't go.

1070
01:19:32,285 --> 01:19:34,729
You have to wait for the
police to get their report

1071
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:36,814
before you can go.

1072
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:38,090
I beg your pardon?

1073
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:42,570
I said, you can't go.

1074
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,430
Well you just watch me, lady.

1075
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:57,026
Belinda Clark, right?
