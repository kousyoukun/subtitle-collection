字幕
Me, stop you from fightin'?

2
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:22,870
字幕
They'd take my old ass out in the back alley before that'd happen, right?

3
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,341
字幕
I don't know about that. I'd probably get my ass kicked.

4
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:32,814
字幕
Hey, nobody is ever a hundred percent goin' into a fight.

5
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,584
字幕
You're always gonna have a little somethin' that's really fucked up.

6
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,424
字幕
You just gotta fight through it, right?

7
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:44,359
字幕
Mhmm.

8
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:44,959
字幕
Okay.

9
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:49,931
字幕
Give it. Spread 'em.

10
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,219
字幕
Oh, ladies and

11
01:12:58,219 --> 01:13:01,909
字幕
gentlemen, it doesn't look good for Aisha. She's on the bottom.

12
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:08,916
字幕
Oh! No, no, she's turned it around, she's on the top! She's dominating!

13
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,587
字幕
They're back on their feet, they're back on their feet.

14
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:20,795
字幕
Alright, we're goin' in for some good Muay Thai exchanges here!

15
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,699
字幕
Good kick, good kick by Aisha!

16
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:33,441
字幕
Oh! And it is over! Aisha knocked her out!

17
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:49,457
字幕
Nora Felix and Chase Alexander? You two are next. Five minutes.

18
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,964
字幕
Kumite! Kumite!

19
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:01,169
字幕
Great.

20
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:02,003
字幕
One, two!

21
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:09,577
字幕
On to the next motherfuckin' around, Nora! When are you goin' up?

22
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:11,446
字幕
- Next. - Oh, okay.

23
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,714
字幕
Okay, well, good luck. Go get 'em. Go get 'em.

24
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:24,759
字幕
You're a fighter. That's why you're here.

25
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,529
字幕
That's why you're fightin' and why you can fight all those things you're

26
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:28,061
字幕
goin' through.

27
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:33,034
字幕
Something got you here!

28
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,856
字幕
Whether it was a reason or something-- something that you're going

29
01:14:35,856 --> 01:14:36,236
字幕
through--

30
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:40,665
字幕
that's what brought you here and it's bringin' that out of you. You've

31
01:14:40,665 --> 01:14:41,476
字幕
gotta let it.

32
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,486
字幕
Nora.

33
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:55,990
字幕
Mom?

34
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:03,564
字幕
Oh! Nice Superman punch by Chase!

35
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,773
字幕
Nora looks like she's in trouble!

36
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,942
字幕
Aw, man, it looks like Nora's in trouble. She's gotta do something. She's

37
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:21,516
字幕
gotta get up!

38
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,764
字幕
Oh, two good kicks to the ribs.

39
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:41,836
字幕
Nora's comin' back.

40
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,553
字幕
Aw, man! Oh, there we go!

41
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:12,300
字幕
Nora's got her up against the cage. Utilizing that clench!

42
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:16,149
字幕
Throwing really good knees. I think she's in trouble-- Chase might be in

43
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:16,571
字幕
trouble!

44
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:17,672
字幕
Ow!

45
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:28,783
字幕
Oh, we got an eye gauge by Chase!

46
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,809
字幕
Woah, woah! Hey, hey, hey! Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it

47
01:16:33,809 --> 01:16:33,921
字幕
up!

48
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,890
字幕
Come on!

49
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,858
字幕
We're here to win a contest, not hurt each other! Now let's go!

50
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,801
字幕
The hell we've been through, no one can hurt you.

51
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,955
字幕
Is Ms. Peters here yet?

52
01:16:50,956 --> 01:16:53,856
字幕
No, not yet. But she will be. Don't wait for her, honey. Just go! Go, go,

53
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:53,974
字幕
go!

54
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:55,743
字幕
Yeah, but I don't wanna leave you alone.

55
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:57,812
字幕
I'll be fine. Now give me a hug. Mmm.

56
01:16:57,814 --> 01:16:58,813
字幕
Okay.

57
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,966
字幕
I might lie down for a bit, anyway.

58
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:20,868
字幕
Are you feeling okay?

59
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,036
字幕
I'm fine!

60
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,772
字幕
You go kick ass!

61
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,141
字幕
I love you, kiddo.

62
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,776
字幕
I love you, too, Mom.

63
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:39,854
字幕
How'm I doing?

64
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,857
字幕
Fuckin' horrible. But you're winnin'.

65
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:45,410
字幕
Really?

66
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,962
字幕
It's hard to see while you're in a fight, but everyone else can see it.

67
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:50,197
字幕
Now get in there and kick her ass.

68
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,867
字幕
You keep those hands up, you keep movin'. Alright?

69
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:53,801
字幕
Spit it out.

70
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:59,040
字幕
There you go. Alright. Let's go. Own it! C'mon!

71
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:17,058
字幕
Nora, you can't fight your way through everything.

72
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:23,269
字幕
Yeah, well, it's not like I'm trying to fight, Mom. It's just the way my

73
01:18:23,269 --> 01:18:23,798
字幕
life works.

74
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,765
字幕
Nora.

75
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,233
字幕
Mom, I take care of you, don't I?

76
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:29,453
字幕
Yes.

77
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,771
字幕
And I make sure that you're not alone for too long.

78
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:36,325
字幕
And I make sure that I have food on the table every night when I get home.

79
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:36,811
字幕
For you.

80
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:38,979
字幕
And I make sure that I have your medicine.

81
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:41,048
字幕
And I make sure that you have your scotch.

82
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,918
字幕
And your crossword puzzles. Right?

83
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:47,588
字幕
So I don't understand. Why do you keep questioning me on what I'm trying

84
01:18:47,588 --> 01:18:47,822
字幕
to do?

85
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,290
字幕
And how I'm living my life?

86
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,727
字幕
You know, I'm trying my best!

87
01:18:53,463 --> 01:18:55,062
字幕
This is the best I can do.

88
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,199
字幕
No, one's giving me these things.

89
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:01,869
字幕
I love you! Is that not enough?

90
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:06,107
字幕
Aw, it's always been enough.

91
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:13,013
字幕
You fight and fight. You're good at it. Like I was.

92
01:19:14,484 --> 01:19:18,252
字幕
But, there are just certain things you're gonna need to accept.

93
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,326
字幕
- I can't talk to you. This is-- - Nora!

94
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:48,315
字幕
Came all this way. For what?

95
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:49,884
字幕
It's okay--

96
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:53,053
字幕
It's not okay. It's not okay, guys!

97
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:03,798
字幕
Alright, it's not too bad. You're in good shape for your next fight.

98
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:06,167
字幕
Wait, I won?

99
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,805
字幕
You keep talkin' like this and I will stop the next fight.

100
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:16,343
字幕
No, wait, Rosheen. I'm sorry. I'm-- Yeah, I'm, I'm good.

101
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:19,246
字幕
Alright. I'm kiddin'. You're there.

102
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:23,217
字幕
Here. Let's go. You got this, kid.

103
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,053
字幕
Breathe.

104
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,232
字幕
Hmm.

105
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,969
字幕
My little Nora.

106
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:45,005
字幕
All grown up.

107
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:52,413
字幕
But you still fit into my arms.

108
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:01,989
字幕
Do you remember sleeping like this when your father...

109
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:08,429
字幕
We were both just babies. All curled up into a little ball.

110
01:21:10,266 --> 01:21:11,999
字幕
Yeah, I remember.

111
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:16,470
字幕
Oh, you were so warm.

112
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:20,040
字幕
And your hair tickled my nose.

113
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:25,312
字幕
You were my little angel.

114
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,086
字幕
You saved my life back then.

115
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:35,055
字幕
I saved?

116
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,023
字幕
Mhm.

117
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:41,896
字幕
Eh, when your father couldn't hack it with my ornery ass anymore,

118
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:44,098
字幕
you were the only thing that kept me going.

119
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:49,370
字幕
You were the only reason I had to get up every morning and carry on.

120
01:21:51,274 --> 01:21:53,307
字幕
Because I had to take care of you.

121
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:56,043
字幕
So,

122
01:21:58,648 --> 01:22:02,249
字幕
I understand what you're doing for me right now. I really do.

123
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,221
字幕
Mom?

124
01:22:07,223 --> 01:22:08,188
字幕
Uh-huh?

125
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:13,928
字幕
Mom--

126
01:22:16,999 --> 01:22:18,098
字幕
Mom,

127
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:21,335
字幕
I'm not proud of what I had to do--

128
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,203
字幕
Your father used to say

129
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:27,508
字幕
"A woman sees the world the way the woman sees it."

130
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,478
字幕
And that way, I would know that he was drunk,

131
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,081
字幕
and I would punch him in the goddamn neck.

132
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:38,419
字幕
Yeah. Fun scene for a child to grow up in. I remember.

133
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:41,121
字幕
Well, certainly toughened you up.

134
01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:43,324
字幕
- It's a tough world. - Yeah.

135
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:44,358
字幕
It's a tough world.

136
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,036
字幕
I think there's still a dent in the wall in the kitchen from when you

137
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:48,562
字幕
threw him.

138
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:55,069
字幕
Well, I had to hurt him so that he didn't hurt me first.

139
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,072
字幕
And in the end, he still did.

140
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:04,979
字幕
Sometimes, I wish I could have stepped into his shoes back then.

141
01:23:05,715 --> 01:23:08,349
字幕
'Cause I would have seen how messed up he was,

142
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:12,186
字幕
and I would have walked out that door, holding you in my arms.

143
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:16,023
字幕
Life is a fight, maybe, Nora.

144
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:18,492
字幕
But you don't have to hurt everyone around you.

145
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,294
字幕
You can just walk away.

146
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,400
字幕
'Cause there, there are other ways to win.

147
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,339
字幕
You are a beautiful, strong woman.

148

One more fight.

Are you okay to go on?

There ain't an ounce of quit in you.

But you know damn good and well Aisha can knock people out.

178
01:25:45,207 --> 01:25:47,141

Or she can rip your arm out.

179
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,910
