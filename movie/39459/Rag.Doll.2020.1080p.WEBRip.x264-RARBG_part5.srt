字幕
You're pissed at me, huh?

2
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,478
字幕
I coulda called the law on you, you'd been in jail. You know that?

3
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:05,214
字幕
As it is, Jesus is probably gonna press charges.

4
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,249
字幕
Jesus is not gonna call the cops.

5
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:10,002
字幕
Yeah, maybe.

6
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:12,754
字幕
But you just can't beat the hell out of a coworker. It's never the answer.

7
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,656
字幕
Well, you don't know how far I was pushed.

字幕
I can guess. I can guess.

9
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,829
字幕
Hurting somebody just 'cause you think you're right?

10
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,065
字幕
That is a fast track to a criminal record, kid.

11
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,869
字幕
Yeah, well, that'd just be one more bullshit thing that I have to fight.

12
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:30,873
字幕
Why? Why does it always have to be a fight with you, Nora?

13
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,542
字幕
Because everything is a fight, Billy!

14
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:37,579
字幕
Yes, yes, you keep telling me. I question your definition of "fight"!

15
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,655
字幕
Rotate that hip. C'mon.

16
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,025

字幕
Eight hours at least, please.

27
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:31,317
字幕
Maybe more, if you can.

28
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,603
字幕
And then, maybe a light run in the morning, a nap, and then it's show time.

29
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:36,038
字幕
You girls got any questions?

30
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,807
字幕
- No, Coach. - Alright. Take it easy.

31
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,718
字幕
- Hey, Aisha? - Sup?

32
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:52,120

33
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:56,592
字幕
Nah, you're good. I was a little too hard on you.

34

字幕
Nah, it was good. You really showed me what it is I want.

35
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:04,066
字幕
And what's that, huh? Huh? Huh?

36
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,552
字幕
I wanna win this.

字幕
Oh, hey! Save the full contact for the tournament!

42
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:23,919
字幕
That was my bad, Coach. Apparently, I'm really bad at reading signals.

43
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:28,056
字幕
Yeah, well, bromancing her to death isn't working. Keep moving!

44
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:30,726
字幕
There you go.

45
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,165

50
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,842
字幕
That's what you need, alright?

51
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:50,779

字幕
Oh. Rosheen said that it was "taken care of?"

67
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:59,815
字幕
What do you think this is? A charity for some straggedy-ass white girl?

68
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:02,084
字幕
I'm sorry there must have been some misunderstanding.
