Why not?

151
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,797

Um, I'm not gonna have the money to pay for the next few days.

158
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,688

Would it be okay if I just paid you in full next week?

159
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:42,659

字幕
one-time thing.

162
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,766
字幕
The reason arrangements are made is so that all the parties involved

163
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,701
字幕
know what's expected of them.

164
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,939
字幕
I know, I just thought that may-- Jesus Christ, Mary!

165
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:59,309

00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,125
字幕
Again, not agreed to!

171
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:17,894
字幕
I know, but it's just a one-time thing.

172
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:21,064
字幕
Double.

173
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,335
字幕
Oh, jump in front of a fucking truck, Mary.

174
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,770
字幕
That's fine! Double, that's totally fine.

175

Thank you, Mrs. Peters. Thank you.

176
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,811

Oh, she is such a bitch!

177
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,914
字幕
Too much. Stop it with all that.

178
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:41,050
字幕
No! She is messing with my positive healing energy.

179
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:44,687
字幕
You know, if you're going to play cards with the terminally ill,

180
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,991
字幕
you should at least lose a few hands. It's only polite.

181
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:52,095
字幕
Just 'cause you suck at cards, mom, doesn't mean that she's a cheater.

182
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,631
字幕
She has no fucking class.

183
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:26,796
字幕
Aw, I used to be strong.

184
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,999
字幕
I used to have boobs.

185
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,870
字幕
This shit just eats everything.

186
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,176
字幕
Nora, tell me...

187
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:47,050
字幕
What are your odds in this thing?

188
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,968
字幕
'Cause, you know, it'll be weird

189
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:54,123
字幕
if you die before I do. That's all I'm sayin'.

190
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,162
字幕
Mom, I'm fighting for you.

191
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:01,964
字幕
You know, this is a lot of money.

192
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,767
字幕
Honey, don't fight for me.

193
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:06,803
字幕
Fight for you.

194
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:09,806
字幕
This is stage four.

195
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,842
字幕
Stage four of fucking four.

196
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,081
字幕
Yeah, well, you'll thank me when you overcome the odds.

197
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,983
字幕
Oh, I won't be here to thank anyone.

198
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,787
字幕
And then what are you gonna do? Hm?

199
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,423
字幕
Mom--
