字幕
Uh, no, that's my mother.

126
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,792
字幕
- You're not Catherine Poe? - No.

127
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,194
字幕
Hold on.

128
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,031
字幕
Hm.

129
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,551
字幕
She's in here, but...

130
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:51,302
字幕
There's an error in my system, says no refills.

131
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:57,041
字幕
I can give you another refill but just as a one-time courtesy. Okay?

132
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,943
字幕
Mhmm. Okay.

133
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,311
字幕

134
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,786
字幕
That will be seventy dollars.

135
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:13,525
字幕
Oh, no. Actually, my mom has Medicare so that shouldn't be any cost.

136
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:14,959
字幕
Okay.

137
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,197
字幕
So it says here the classification for this drug has changed.

138
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,802
字幕
Medicare only covers seventy-five percent. The rest is your copay.

139
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,005
字幕
So then the copay is the seventy dollars.

140
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,973
字幕
The co-pay is the seventy dollars.

141
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,343
字幕
Well, I don't have seventy dollars.

142
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,946
字幕
Do you have a credit card?

143
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,314
字幕
No.

144
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,149
字幕
- Debit card? - No, I don't have...

145
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,884
字幕
We don't take checks.

146
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,288
字幕
No, listen, you don't understand. I don't have seventy dollars.

147
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,190
字幕
This has always been free.

148
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,860
字幕
You know I was never called about this or anything,

149
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,997
字幕
so I wasn't prepared to pay today, so I don't have seventy dollars.

150
