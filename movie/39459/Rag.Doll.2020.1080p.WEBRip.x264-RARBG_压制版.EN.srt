00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,040
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no.

145
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,520
{\r原文字幕}Actually, my mom has Medicare so that shouldn't be any cost.

146
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,330
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

147
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,190
{\r原文字幕}So it says here the classification for this drug has changed.

148
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,800
{\r原文字幕}Medicare only covers seventy-five percent. The rest is your copay.

149
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,000
{\r原文字幕}So then the copay is the seventy dollars.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,970
{\r原文字幕}The co-pay is the seventy dollars.

151
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,340
{\r原文字幕}Well, I don't have seventy dollars.

152
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,940
{\r原文字幕}Do you have a credit card?

153
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,310
{\r原文字幕}No.

154
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,140
{\r原文字幕}- Debit card? - No, I don't have...

155
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,880
{\r原文字幕}We don't take checks.

156
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,280
{\r原文字幕}No, listen, you don't understand. I don't have seventy dollars.

157
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,190
{\r原文字幕}This has always been free.

158
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,860
{\r原文字幕}You know I was never called about this or anything,

159
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,990
{\r原文字幕}so I wasn't prepared to pay today, so I don't have seventy dollars.

160
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,560
{\r原文字幕}I don't know what you want me to do, um...

161
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,670
{\r原文字幕}I don't know what you want me to do.

162
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,760
{\r原文字幕}Look, the classification for the drug has changed.

163
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,180
{\r原文字幕}There's really nothing I can do.

164
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,050
{\r原文字幕}Do you know what that medication is?

165
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,240
{\r原文字幕}You know what the-- what that does? What I need it for?

166
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,180
{\r原文字幕}You're aware that my mom needs that medication, or she could die.

167
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,050
{\r原文字幕}Like you're aware of that, right?

168
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,190
{\r原文字幕}This has always been free. So I think there's just...

169
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,590
{\r原文字幕}I think you're doing something incorrect, and you need to fix it.

170
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,100
{\r原文字幕}Okay. I've never had to pay for this.

171
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,060
{\r原文字幕}You think I'm incorrect?

172
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,330
{\r原文字幕}Yes, I do. I think you should look into your computer

173
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,330
{\r原文字幕}and figure out a way to get my mother these drugs!

174
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,410
{\r原文字幕}The way to get your mom these drugs is to give me seventy dollars.

175
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,940
{\r原文字幕}This is fucking bullshit, can you go get somebody?

176
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,280
{\r原文字幕}Hey, hey doc. Hey doc, can I?

177
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,350
{\r原文字幕}Go get your manager. I gotta go to work.

178
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,150
{\r原文字幕}So I need to fucking get outta here

179
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,880
{\r原文字幕}Doc, can I?

180
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,150
{\r原文字幕}So please, can you give me my mom's medication.

181
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,190
{\r原文字幕}Pharmacist? Can I talk to you for a second?

182
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,260
{\r原文字幕}One second. Yeah, hold on.

183
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,640
{\r原文字幕}So I'll just take care of it if it's okay.

184
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,230
{\r原文字幕}What?

185
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,060
{\r原文字幕}I'll just take care of it if it's okay.

186
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,900
{\r原文字幕}We can just add it to my, to my stuff and we can handle it.

187
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,070
{\r原文字幕}What? This isn't a bar ,sir. What-- what are you saying?

188
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
{\r原文字幕}I'll just take care of her stuff.

189
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,170
{\r原文字幕}- Her stuff? - Yeah!

190
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,180
{\r原文字幕}You want to pay for this woman?

191
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,380
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

192
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,580
{\r原文字幕}No, it's no problem. Seriously, it's not a big deal.

193
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,250
{\r原文字幕}No, like really.

194
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,120
{\r原文字幕}- No, I... - Look, I don't have money to pay you back.

195
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
{\r原文字幕}Look it's up to you, I just...

196
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,660
{\r原文字幕}My sister had cancer, so I understand what you're going through...

197
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,500
{\r原文字幕}and uh, yeah, I mean, I got it--

198
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,170
{\r原文字幕}You're a nice man.

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,410

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,480
{\r原文字幕}With a "W". Wright.

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,340
{\r原文字幕}Yeah. Breast.

220
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,350
{\r原文字幕}Oh. What did you guys do?

221
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,640
{\r原文字幕}Did you guys just do like straight chemo?

222
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,020
{\r原文字幕}Did you try, like, the new drug trials, or...

223
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,120
{\r原文字幕}The doctors kept misdiagnosing her.

224
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,570
{\r原文字幕}I mean, like, when they found out what it actually was,

225
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,360
{\r原文字幕}it was too late.

226
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,430
{\r原文字幕}I'm...I'm so sorry.

227
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,300
{\r原文字幕}Oh yeah, no. I mean, death is... death.

228
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,340
{\r原文字幕}But you can't-- you can't go backwards, right?

229
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,210
{\r原文字幕}You can't go backwards.

230
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,380
{\r原文字幕}That's what all this--

231
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,800
{\r原文字幕}I mean, I guess what some of these

232
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,380

239
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,610
{\r原文字幕}Pat, she's my-- she's the group leader

240
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,340
{\r原文字幕}and she's a super cool chick.

{\r原文字幕}you don't wanna talk to the crazy guy, right?

249
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,470
{\r原文字幕}No!

250
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,800
{\r原文字幕}Like, my dad

{\r原文字幕}Oh! Cool!

253
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,480

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,820
{\r原文字幕}why're you gonna do that?

261
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,850
{\r原文字幕}Because it's the fastest way across town.

262
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,620
{\r原文字幕}Yo, why do guys always think that

263
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,550
{\r原文字幕}they know the fastest way around?

{\r原文字幕}They say it's good for you to talk to people

280
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,260
{\r原文字幕}'cause this stuff, uh--

{\r原文字幕}No. Just one more thing I have to fight.

440
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,660
{\r原文字幕}Be careful, Nora.

441
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,790
{\r原文字幕}C'mon! Move your feet, Nora!

{\r原文字幕}Nora, you good?

459
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,000
{\r原文字幕}Nah, it's all good. We were sparring, and I just got distracted.

460
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,070
{\r原文字幕}Damn! It's still bleeding?

461
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,040
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I think so. Yeah, it's not stopping.

462
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,040
{\r原文字幕}Here.

463
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,150
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no. Aisha, you don't have to do that.

464
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,310
{\r原文字幕}I know. But I am.

465
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,320
{\r原文字幕}Lean back. Lean back.

466
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,390
{\r原文字幕}Does that hurt?

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,020
{\r原文字幕}Ow!

468
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,230
{\r原文字幕}You're such a little bitch.

469
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,330
{\r原文字幕}Shut up! To you, maybe.

470
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,010
{\r原文字幕}Okay. I'm gonna try one more thing.

471
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,040
{\r原文字幕}I just want to make sure it's not broken.

472
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,140
{\r原文字幕}- Does that hurt? - No.

473
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,420

481
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,530
{\r原文字幕}Hey, look. I'm really sorry.

482
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,880
{\r原文字幕}I didn't mean to cross the line.

483
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,000
{\r原文字幕}Look, I want you to know I respect you, wholeheartedly,

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,030
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I'm training with you. That's it.

492
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,780
{\r原文字幕}I just misread things, that's all.

493
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,330
{\r原文字幕}So you just kiss people who are married?

{\r原文字幕}Get outta my face, Nora.

498
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,490
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, Aisha.

499
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,190
{\r原文字幕}What is a ten letter word for mayonnaise?

500
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,090
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I think it's fucking mayonnaise.

501
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,190
{\r原文字幕}What other-- what other word could that be?

502
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,710
{\r原文字幕}- I think it's a trick. - Hey, I'm going for my run.

503
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,530
{\r原文字幕}You gonna be okay?

504
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,130
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. You go for your run.

505
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,440
{\r原文字幕}I would go with you, except for this whole, shitty dying thing.

506
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,900
{\r原文字幕}You know, it's not funny, mom.

507
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,210
{\r原文字幕}I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.

508
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,510
{\r原文字幕}I get it. Who wants to sit around watching me fall apart anymore?

509
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,680
{\r原文字幕}So you run, it's fine.

510
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,120
{\r原文字幕}Look, you know that I'm training right now.

511
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,520
{\r原文字幕}For what? Wrestling?

512
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,330
{\r原文字幕}It's not just wrestling. I'm actually getting pretty good at this.

513
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,630
{\r原文字幕}Okay. So where's that lead?

514
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,530
{\r原文字幕}A career? I don't know.

515
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,200
{\r原文字幕}Some people actually make really good money at this.

516
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,270
{\r原文字幕}Okay, but really good people, right?

517
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,540
{\r原文字幕}I am good.

518
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,350
{\r原文字幕}Your face, Nora.

519
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,350
{\r原文字幕}Is that a sign that you're good?

520
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,890
{\r原文字幕}Well, actually, there are a few people at the gym who think

521
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,760
{\r原文字幕}that I should join the upcoming MMA tournament, so yeah.

522
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,660
{\r原文字幕}So I am.

523
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,700
{\r原文字幕}MMA. Is that mixed martial anaconda?

10524
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:26,340


525
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,340
{\r原文字幕}Masculine marshmallow Abercrombie?

526
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,340

528
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,720
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I will be. Will you?

10529
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,620


10530
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,620


10531
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,620


532
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,360
{\r原文字幕}Yo, yo, yo, Nora! One o'clock?

533

{\r原文字幕}Not today, man.

534
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,560
{\r原文字幕}Man, I told you that boxing shit is no good for business.

538
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,510
{\r原文字幕}Well, I gotta lay off anyways. I got a fight this weekend.

539
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,410
{\r原文字幕}No, no, no, no, no. This shit messes me up, man!

540
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,980
{\r原文字幕}- Look - What am I supposed to tell this guy?

541
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,550
{\r原文字幕}I don't know! Tell him I have a blistering STD or some shit.

542
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,660
{\r原文字幕}Fuck, man!

{\r原文字幕}Ten more a pop, and that's it.

560

{\r原文字幕}And I was like, "Nah, fuck that!" No, bitch.

{\r原文字幕}Would it be okay if I just paid you in full next week?

627
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,650
{\r原文字幕}That's not our arrangement.

628
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,530
{\r原文字幕}I know, um, I was kinda hopin' you'd help me out

629
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,760
{\r原文字幕}and it'd be like a one-time thing.

630
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,060
{\r原文字幕}The reason arrangements are made is so that

631
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,700
{\r原文字幕}all the parties involved know what's expected of them.

{\r原文字幕}- I know, I just thought that may - Jesus Christ, Mary!

633
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,020
{\r原文字幕}If she says she's gonna pay you next week,

{\r原文字幕}Again, not agreed to!

640
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,890
{\r原文字幕}I know, but it's just a one-time thing.

641
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,060
{\r原文字幕}Double.

642
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,330
{\r原文字幕}Oh, jump in front of a fucking truck, Mary.

643
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,770
{\r原文字幕}That's fine! Double, that's totally fine.

644

{\r原文字幕}Oh, she is such a bitch!

646
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,910
{\r原文字幕}Too much. Stop it with all that.

647
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,050
{\r原文字幕}No! She is messing with my positive healing energy.

648
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,680
{\r原文字幕}You know, if you're going to play cards with the terminally ill,

649
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,990
{\r原文字幕}you should at least lose a few hands. It's only polite.

650
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,410
{\r原文字幕}Just 'cause you suck at cards, mom,

651
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,090
{\r原文字幕}doesn't mean that she's a cheater.

652
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,630
{\r原文字幕}She has no fucking class.

653
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,790
{\r原文字幕}Aw, I used to be strong.

654
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,990
{\r原文字幕}I used to have boobs.

655
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,870
{\r原文字幕}This shit just eats everything.

656
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,170
{\r原文字幕}Nora, tell me...

657
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,050
{\r原文字幕}What are your odds in this thing?

658
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,960
{\r原文字幕}'Cause, you know, it'll be weird

659
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,120
{\r原文字幕}if you die before I do. That's all I'm sayin'.

660
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,160
{\r原文字幕}Mom, I'm fighting for you.

661
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,960
{\r原文字幕}You know, this is a lot of money.

662
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
{\r原文字幕}Honey, don't fight for me.

663
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,800
{\r原文字幕}Fight for you.

664
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,800
{\r原文字幕}This is stage four.

665
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,840
{\r原文字幕}Stage four of fucking four.

666
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,080
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, well, you'll thank me when you overcome the odds.

667
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,980
{\r原文字幕}Oh, I won't be here to thank anyone.

668
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,780
{\r原文字幕}And then what are you gonna do? Hm?

669
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,010
{\r原文字幕}Mom--

670
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,060
{\r原文字幕}Look, Nora, I'm gonna die

671
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,560
{\r原文字幕}and it'll probably be in the next two months.

672
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,890
{\r原文字幕}And you need a realistic plan.

673
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,190
{\r原文字幕}I'm not listening to this shit.

674
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,820
{\r原文字幕}You will lose this house without my disability

675
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,230
{\r原文字幕}then where are you gonna go?

676
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,100
{\r原文字幕}What are you gonna do?

677
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,900
{\r原文字幕}I have a plan.

678
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,870
{\r原文字幕}I'm gonna win this tournament, I'm gonna win the money,

679
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,580
{\r原文字幕}and I'm gonna get you the proper care that you need!

680
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,100
{\r原文字幕}Oh, honey, that's not real.

681
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,950
{\r原文字幕}That's just a dream.

682
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,620
{\r原文字幕}Well, it's my dream. Stop trying to take it away from me.

683
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,510
{\r原文字幕}Hey! Nora!

684

{\r原文字幕}No, not like that guy

699
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,800

704
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,110
{\r原文字幕}That doesn't mean I owe you anything.

{\r原文字幕}Spit it out.

865
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,200
{\r原文字幕}I got fired today.

866
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,240
{\r原文字幕}For what?

867
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,400
{\r原文字幕}For fighting.

868
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,130
{\r原文字幕}Fighting at work.

869
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,330
{\r原文字幕}It wasn't my fault.

870
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,420
{\r原文字幕}You know, I just was standing up for myself

871
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,750
{\r原文字幕}and it got a little physical,

872
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,380
{\r原文字幕}that's all.

873
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,760
{\r原文字幕}Well, that must have been a dandy of a brouhaha.

874
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,000
{\r原文字幕}Look, Mom.

875
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,930
{\r原文字幕}I don't know how I'm gonna pay for everything without this job.

876
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,610
{\r原文字幕}I don't even know how I'm gonna pay Mary back!

877
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,390
{\r原文字幕}Oh, fuck that cow.

878
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,400
{\r原文字幕}What is she gonna do to you, sue ya?

879
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,400
{\r原文字幕}For what? This shithole?

880
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,000
{\r原文字幕}No. You will find something else, Nora.

881
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,800
{\r原文字幕}I just want better for us.

882
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,440
{\r原文字幕}Well then,

883
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,500
{\r原文字幕}I guess there's only one thing you can do.

884
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,340
{\r原文字幕}Win that damn tournament.

885
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:12,180
{\r原文字幕}Win that whole goddamn MM-- Mountain Man Asshole thing.

886
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,390
{\r原文字幕}You go kick everybody's goddamn ass.

887
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,340
{\r原文字幕}Hey, Nora. I have your, uh, severance check here.

888
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:50,840
{\r原文字幕}Cool.

889
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,850
{\r原文字幕}You're pissed at me, huh?

890
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,600
{\r原文字幕}I coulda called the law on you,

891
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,260
{\r原文字幕}you'd been in jail. You know that?

892
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,000
{\r原文字幕}As it is, Jesus is probably gonna press charges.

893
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,030
{\r原文字幕}Jesus is not gonna call the cops.

894
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,380
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, maybe.

895
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,340
{\r原文字幕}But you just can't beat the hell out of a coworker.

896
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,540
{\r原文字幕}It's never the answer.

897
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,440
{\r原文字幕}Well, you don't know how far I was pushed.

898
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,990
{\r原文字幕}I can guess.

899
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,540
{\r原文字幕}I can guess.

900
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,610
{\r原文字幕}Hurting somebody just 'cause you think you're right?

901
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,850
{\r原文字幕}That is a fast track to a criminal record, kid.

902
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,600
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, well, that'd just be one more

903
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,210
{\r原文字幕}bullshit thing that I have to fight.

904
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,030
{\r原文字幕}Why?

905
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,660
{\r原文字幕}Why does it always have to be a fight with you, Nora?

906
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,320
{\r原文字幕}Because everything is a fight, Billy!

907
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,180
{\r原文字幕}Yes, yes, you keep telling me.

908
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,360
{\r原文字幕}I question your definition of "fight"!

909
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,440
{\r原文字幕}Rotate that hip. C'mon.

910
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,810
{\r原文字幕}Alright, good job girls. That's the day.

911
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,580
{\r原文字幕}- Thank you, Coach! - Yep.

912
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,750
{\r原文字幕}Aisha, Nora! You're up!

913
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,430
{\r原文字幕}Thanks.

914
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,730
{\r原文字幕}Alright ladies, it's game time.

915
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,110
{\r原文字幕}Two o'clock tomorrow evenin',

916
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,470
{\r原文字幕}I'll meet you both at the Civic Center and

917
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,670
{\r原文字幕}we'll see what we see.

918
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,950
{\r原文字幕}But for right now, however,

919
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,240
{\r原文字幕}I need you to really concentrate on

920
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,610
{\r原文字幕}your structure and your footwork.

921
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,380
{\r原文字幕}Tonight, get your rest.

922
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,810
{\r原文字幕}Eight hours at least, please.

923
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,960
{\r原文字幕}Maybe more, if you can.

924
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,040
{\r原文字幕}And then, maybe a light run in the morning,

925
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,390
{\r原文字幕}a nap, and then it's show time.

926
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,820
{\r原文字幕}You girls got any questions?

927
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,590
{\r原文字幕}- No, Coach. - Alright. Take it easy.

928
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,500
{\r原文字幕}- Hey, Aisha? - Sup?

929
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,900
{\r原文字幕}Just wanted to say I'm really sorry about yesterday.

930
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,370
{\r原文字幕}Nah, you're good. I was a little too hard on you.

931
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,030
{\r原文字幕}Nah, it was good.

932
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,840
{\r原文字幕}You really showed me what it is I want.

933
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,850
{\r原文字幕}And what's that, huh? Huh? Huh?

934
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,450
{\r原文字幕}I wanna win this.

935
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,370
{\r原文字幕}You know you're gonna have to get through me, right?

936
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,820
{\r原文字幕}I'm not your damn sidekick, boo!

937
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:10,750
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I know.

938
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,560
{\r原文字幕}Maybe it's you who's gonna have to get through me!

939
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,960
{\r原文字幕}Alright, honey.

940
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,460
{\r原文字幕}Oh, hey! Save the full contact for the tournament!

941
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:22,620
{\r原文字幕}That was my bad, Coach.

942
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,700
{\r原文字幕}Apparently, I'm really bad at reading signals.

943
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,960
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, well, bromancing her to death isn't working.

944
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,840
{\r原文字幕}Keep moving!

945
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,510
{\r原文字幕}There you go.

946
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,950
{\r原文字幕}Nora! Where you at?

947
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,750
{\r原文字幕}Over here, Coach!

948
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,790
{\r原文字幕}Hey, good job today, kid.

949
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,170
{\r原文字幕}Thanks.

950
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,690
{\r原文字幕}I feel like your headspace is finally getting dialed in.

951
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,620
{\r原文字幕}That's what you need, alright?

952
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,560
{\r原文字幕}Now, I want you to go home tonight, get plenty of rest,

953
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,930
{\r原文字幕}load up on carbs, and get a lot of sleep. Alright?

954
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:58,500
{\r原文字幕}And please get that damn hair braided.

955
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,800
{\r原文字幕}I was just gonna like, put it in like a bun or something.

956
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:04,040
{\r原文字幕}No you're not. I got you covered, they're expecting you.

957
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,440
{\r原文字幕}- Tonight? - Yep.

958
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,620
{\r原文字幕}Rosheen, I don't have money to pay for this.

959
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,460
{\r原文字幕}I got ya. It's taken care of, don't worry about it.

960
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,450
{\r原文字幕}Really?

961
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,170
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

962
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:20,060
{\r原文字幕}Alright. My little rag doll won't be so raggy!

963
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,890
{\r原文字幕}Go get 'em, girl!

964
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,320
{\r原文字幕}Hi. Can I help you?

965
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,700
{\r原文字幕}Um, Rosheen sent me to get my hair done for my fight.

966
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,820
{\r原文字幕}Like, braids or something?

967
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,490
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, yeah. I know. I can get you for two hundred dollars.

968
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,020
{\r原文字幕}Oh. Rosheen said that it was "taken care of?"

969
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,550
{\r原文字幕}What do you think this is?

970
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,220
{\r原文字幕}A charity for some straggedy-ass white girl?

971
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,630
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry there must have been some misunderstanding.

972
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,890
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry.

973
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,300
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no, no, no, no, come back, come back!

974
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,870
{\r原文字幕}I'm just teasing you! Come on, I'm playing!

975
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,640
{\r原文字幕}Come on in. Now, damn!

976
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,680
{\r原文字幕}Don't take everything so damn personal! Come on!

977
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,010
{\r原文字幕}It's like every other word was "oh, sorry!"

978
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,320
{\r原文字幕}Like a ticking time bomb.

979
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,920
{\r原文字幕}She was gonna come back and shoot this whole place up.

980
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,620
{\r原文字幕}Y'all, stop! Okay, look.

981

{\r原文字幕}You know, I'mma make you look like a champion!

984
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:43,540
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, yeah! Girls fight like, way harder than guys! - What?

985
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,610
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, like, guys can go in, and they'll shake hands afterwards,

986
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,840
{\r原文字幕}and they're all cool but girls, sometimes,

987
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,610
{\r原文字幕}they hold a grudge. It's pretty nasty.

988
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,650
{\r原文字幕}Mhm. I know that's right.

989
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,650
{\r原文字幕}Well, Miss Champion. Viola!

{\r原文字幕}You like it?

992
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,360
{\r原文字幕}Sorry I'm late.

993
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,670
{\r原文字幕}I had to cover a shift for this bitch that got fired.

994
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:13,800
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no worries, it's fine. Look like it's getting late anyway.

995
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:17,310
{\r原文字幕}Nobody here but the usual suspects.

996
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,940
{\r原文字幕}Oh, and the "female Rocky" over here!

997

999
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,060

{\r原文字幕}What's going on?

1003
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,900
{\r原文字幕}That's that crazy ass bitch with the mother.

1004
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,900
{\r原文字幕}- Oh! - Yeah!

{\r原文字幕}Bitch, you heard what I said, okay?

01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,800
{\r原文字幕}Nora.

1151
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,460
{\r原文字幕}Mom?

1152
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,790
{\r原文字幕}Nice Superman punch by Chase!

1153
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,770
{\r原文字幕}Nora looks like she's in trouble!

1154
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,560
{\r原文字幕}Oh, man, it looks like Nora's in trouble.

1155
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,770
{\r原文字幕}She's gotta do something. She's gotta get up!

1156
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,070
{\r原文字幕}Two good kicks to the ribs.

1157
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,170
{\r原文字幕}Nora's comin' back.

1158
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,640
{\r原文字幕}Oh, man! There we go!

1159
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,780
{\r原文字幕}Nora's got her up against the cage. Utilizing that clench!

1160
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,150
{\r原文字幕}Throwing really good knees. I think she's in trouble--

1161
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:16,570
{\r原文字幕}Chase might be in trouble!

1162
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,330
{\r原文字幕}We got an eye gauge by Chase!

1163
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,260
{\r原文字幕}Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up!

1164
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,800
{\r原文字幕}- Come on! - We're here to win a contest,

1165
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,960
{\r原文字幕}not hurt each other! Now let's go!

1166
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,100
{\r原文字幕}The hell we've been through, no one can hurt you.

1167
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,270
{\r原文字幕}- Is Ms. Peters here yet? - No, not yet.

1168
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:52,900
{\r原文字幕}But she will be. Don't wait for her, honey.

1169
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,650
{\r原文字幕}Just go! Go, go, go!

1170
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:55,900
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, but I don't wanna leave you alone.

1171
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,810
{\r原文字幕}I'll be fine. Now give me a hug.

1172
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:58,810
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1173
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,150
{\r原文字幕}I might lie down for a bit, anyway.

1174
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,300
{\r原文字幕}Are you feeling okay?

1175
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,460
{\r原文字幕}I'm fine!

1176
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,770
{\r原文字幕}You go kick ass!

1177
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,780
{\r原文字幕}I love you, kiddo.

1178
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,770
{\r原文字幕}I love you, too, Mom.

1179
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:39,990
{\r原文字幕}How'm I doing?

1180
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,850
{\r原文字幕}Fuckin' horrible. But you're winnin'.

1181
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:44,330
{\r原文字幕}Really?

1182
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,120
{\r原文字幕}It's hard to see while you're in a fight,

1183
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,200
{\r原文字幕}but everyone else can see it.

1184
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,710
{\r原文字幕}Now get in there and kick her ass.

1185
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:52,670
{\r原文字幕}You keep those hands up, you keep movin'.

1186
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,960
{\r原文字幕}Alright? Spit it out.

1187
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,380
{\r原文字幕}There you go. Alright. Let's go. Own it! C'mon!

1188
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,480
{\r原文字幕}Nora, you can't fight your way through everything.

1189
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,440
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, well, it's not like I'm trying to fight, Mom.

1190
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,900
{\r原文字幕}It's just the way my life works.

1191
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,040
{\r原文字幕}Nora.

1192
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,700
{\r原文字幕}Mom, I take care of you, don't I?

1193
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,500
{\r原文字幕}Yes.

1194
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:32,040
{\r原文字幕}And I make sure that you're not alone for too long.

1195
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,290
{\r原文字幕}And I make sure that I have food on the table every night

1196
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,240
{\r原文字幕}when I get home. For you.

1197
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,340
{\r原文字幕}And I make sure that I have your medicine.

1198
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,440
{\r原文字幕}And I make sure that you have your scotch.

1199
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,240
{\r原文字幕}And your crossword puzzles. Right?

1200
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,010
{\r原文字幕}So I don't understand. Why do you keep questioning me

1201
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:48,260
{\r原文字幕}on what I'm trying to do?

1202
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,720
{\r原文字幕}And how I'm living my life?

1203
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,900
{\r原文字幕}You know, I'm trying my best!

1204
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,560
{\r原文字幕}This is the best I can do.

1205
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,620
{\r原文字幕}No, one's giving me these things.

1206
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,120
{\r原文字幕}I love you! Is that not enough?

1207
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,460
{\r原文字幕}It's always been enough.

1208
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,920
{\r原文字幕}You fight and fight.

1209
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,330
{\r原文字幕}You're good at it. Like I was.

1210
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:18,420
{\r原文字幕}But, there are just certain things you're gonna need to accept.

1211
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,850
{\r原文字幕}- I can't talk to you. This is-- - Nora!

1212
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:48,180
{\r原文字幕}Came all this way. For what?

1213
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:49,880
{\r原文字幕}It's okay--

1214
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,050
{\r原文字幕}It's not okay. It's not okay, guys!

1215
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:02,080
{\r原文字幕}Alright, it's not too bad.

1216
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,120
{\r原文字幕}You're in good shape for your next fight.

1217
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,430
{\r原文字幕}Wait, I won?

1218
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,270
{\r原文字幕}You keep talkin' like this and I will stop the next fight.

1219
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,920
{\r原文字幕}No, wait, Rosheen. I'm sorry.

1220
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,770
{\r原文字幕}I'm-- Yeah, I'm, I'm good.

1221
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,420
{\r原文字幕}Alright. I'm kiddin'. You're there.

1222
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,380
{\r原文字幕}Here. Let's go. You got this, kid.

1223
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,520
{\r原文字幕}Breathe.

1224
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,380
{\r原文字幕}My little Nora.

1225
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,350
{\r原文字幕}All grown up.

1226
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,840
{\r原文字幕}But you still fit into my arms.

1227
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,410
{\r原文字幕}Do you remember sleeping like this when your father...

1228
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,580
{\r原文字幕}We were both just babies. All curled up into a little ball.

1229
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,490
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I remember.

1230
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,250
{\r原文字幕}You were so warm.

1231
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,180
{\r原文字幕}And your hair tickled my nose.

1232
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,760
{\r原文字幕}You were my little angel.

1233
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,430
{\r原文字幕}You saved my life back then.

1234
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,390
{\r原文字幕}I saved?

1235
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,960
{\r原文字幕}When your father couldn't hack it with my ornery ass anymore,

1236
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,440
{\r原文字幕}you were the only thing that kept me going.

1237
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,860
{\r原文字幕}You were the only reason I had

1238
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,820
{\r原文字幕}to get up every morning and carry on.

1239
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,760
{\r原文字幕}Because I had to take care of you.

1240
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,390
{\r原文字幕}So,

1241
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,580
{\r原文字幕}I understand what you're doing for me right now. I really do.

1242
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,640
{\r原文字幕}Mom?

1243
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,250
{\r原文字幕}Mom--

1244
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,290
{\r原文字幕}Mom,

1245
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,560
{\r原文字幕}I'm not proud of what I had to do--

1246
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,610
{\r原文字幕}Your father used to say

1247
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:27,940
{\r原文字幕}"A woman sees the world the way the woman sees it."

1248
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,020
{\r原文字幕}And that way, I would know that he was drunk,

1249
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,240
{\r原文字幕}and I would punch him in the goddamn neck.

1250
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,240
{\r原文字幕}Yeah. Fun scene for a child

1251
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,760
{\r原文字幕}to grow up in. I remember.

1252
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,400
{\r原文字幕}Well, certainly toughened you up.

1253
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,660
{\r原文字幕}- It's a tough world. - Yeah.

1254
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,920
{\r原文字幕}It's a tough world.

1255
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,840
{\r原文字幕}I think there's still a dent in the wall in the kitchen

1256
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,420
{\r原文字幕}from when you threw him.

1257
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,350
{\r原文字幕}Well, I had to hurt him so that he didn't hurt me first.

1258
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,370
{\r原文字幕}And in the end, he still did.

1259
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,310
{\r原文字幕}Sometimes, I wish I could have stepped

1260
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,200
{\r原文字幕}into his shoes back then.

1261
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,730
{\r原文字幕}'Cause I would have seen how messed up he was,

1262
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:10,700
{\r原文字幕}and I would have walked out that door,

1263
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,360
{\r原文字幕}holding you in my arms.

1264
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,410
{\r原文字幕}Life is a fight, maybe, Nora.

1265
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,790
{\r原文字幕}But you don't have to hurt everyone around you.

1266
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,410
{\r原文字幕}You can just walk away.

1267
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:27,160
{\r原文字幕}'Cause there, there are other ways to win.

1268
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,700
{\r原文字幕}You are a beautiful, strong woman.

1269
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,760
{\r原文字幕}And I am so proud of you.

1270
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,270
{\r原文字幕}And I'm gonna miss you so goddamn much when I go.

1271
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,960
{\r原文字幕}How the hell'd the judges not see me

1272
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,580
{\r原文字幕}whoop your ass for three rounds?

1273
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,050
{\r原文字幕}I had your ass, bitch!

1274
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,380
{\r原文字幕}And you know it! This was my fight!

1275
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,240
{\r原文字幕}- You fuckin' rigged somethin' around here - Hey!

1276
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,250
{\r原文字幕}Jane, get the hell out of here! It's over!

1277
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,900
{\r原文字幕}Get outta here!

1278
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,950
{\r原文字幕}We won again?

1279
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,260
{\r原文字幕}You're in one hell of a zone.

1280
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:38,910
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1281
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:40,490
{\r原文字幕}But you took a few good shots.

1282
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,640
{\r原文字幕}Here, lemme close some of those cuts up.

1283
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,280
{\r原文字幕}Here, put your head back.

1284
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,460
{\r原文字幕}Hold on.

1285
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,630
{\r原文字幕}Alright, hold it still.

1286
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,410
{\r原文字幕}Lemme get this; I don't want it to split back open.

1287
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,470
{\r原文字幕}One more fight.

1288
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,500
{\r原文字幕}One more fight.

1289
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,650
{\r原文字幕}We good, Rosheen.

1290
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,220
{\r原文字幕}Always got my girl's corner, anyway.

1291
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,100
{\r原文字幕}Is that right?

1292
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,030
{\r原文字幕}Rosheen, we good. She doesn't have anybody, anyway.

1293
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,870
{\r原文字幕}- Damn right. - Babe. Be nice, man.

1294
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,830
{\r原文字幕}If I was gonna lose to anybody,

1295
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,110
{\r原文字幕}it'd be you, Aisha.

1296
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:28,340
{\r原文字幕}Aisha, she's trying to get into your head.

1297
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,270
{\r原文字幕}Don't listen to her.

1298
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,170
{\r原文字幕}Are you okay to go on?

1299
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:38,300
{\r原文字幕}Rosheen, I told you, I cannot quit. I gotta--

1300
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,430
{\r原文字幕}I'm messin' with you!

1301
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,300
{\r原文字幕}There ain't an ounce of quit in you.

1302
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,600
{\r原文字幕}But you know damn good and well Aisha can knock people out.

1303
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,520
{\r原文字幕}Or she can rip your arm out.

1304
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,230
{\r原文字幕}I need you to focus and stay focused,

1305
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,610
{\r原文字幕}'cause I don't know where the hell your head's at today.

1306
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,560
{\r原文字幕}It's been a weird day.

1307
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,710
{\r原文字幕}The hell we've been through, no one can hurt you.

1308
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,400
{\r原文字幕}- Is Ms. Peters here yet? - No, not yet.

1309
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,020
{\r原文字幕}But don't wait for her, honey. Just, just go!

1310
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,840
{\r原文字幕}Go, go, go!

1311
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,720
{\r原文字幕}Mom, I don't wanna leave you alone.

1312
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,470
{\r原文字幕}I will be fine. Now you give me a hug and a kiss.

1313
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,660
{\r原文字幕}I may lay down for a bit.

1314
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,290
{\r原文字幕}Are you okay?

1315
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:51,440
{\r原文字幕}Yep! Just a proud mama!

1316
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,200
{\r原文字幕}You go kick ass!

1317
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,710
{\r原文字幕}I love you, kiddo.

1318
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,080
{\r原文字幕}I love you, too, Ma.

1319
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,890
{\r原文字幕}Alright, the two are at center.

1320
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,390
{\r原文字幕}You can see the tension in their--

1321
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,220
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - Between their coaches.

1322
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,180
{\r原文字幕}Aisha looks ready to go. She looks ready to pounce.

1323
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,060
{\r原文字幕}- Nora looks-- Relaxed. - Yeah.

1324
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,280
{\r原文字幕}- Alright, touch gloves. - Gettin' ready to break,

1325
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,060
{\r原文字幕}touchin' gloves, and here we go!

1326
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,530
{\r原文字幕}Wait, guys! No, wait, something's happening!

1327
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:59,500
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, it is! A fight! Now, get out there and fight!

1328
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:07,280
{\r原文字幕}C'mon, Nora! Get your hands up! C'mon!

1329
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,900
{\r原文字幕}Oh shit.

11330
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:36,410


1331
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:35,040
{\r原文字幕}Nora could be tappin' out any second. She's kind of...

1332
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,410
{\r原文字幕}She's gonna tap!

1333
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,320
{\r原文字幕}C'mon, Nora, get out of her! Roll out!

1334
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:00,660
{\r原文字幕}- She's kind of... - She's gonna tap, she's gonna tap!

1335
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:07,740
{\r原文字幕}C'mon, Nora! Roll out of it! Roll out of it!

1336
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,640
{\r原文字幕}What a reversal!

1337
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,610
{\r原文字幕}There you go! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1338
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,480
{\r原文字幕}She's got her back turned again!

1339
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:23,690
{\r原文字幕}What are you doing? Get out there!

1340
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:24,820
{\r原文字幕}Come on now!

1341
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,490
{\r原文字幕}Turn around!

1342
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:30,760
{\r原文字幕}Nora, don't!

1343
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,460
{\r原文字幕}Get out there! Go get her! Go get her!

1344
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,430
{\r原文字幕}- There it is. - That's what's happening right now.

1345
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:39,770
{\r原文字幕}Protect yourself! Get your arms up!

1346
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:46,510
{\r原文字幕}No, come on! Come on, Nora, you gotta fight!

1347
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:01,420
{\r原文字幕}This what you want? This what you really want?

1348
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,450
{\r原文字幕}Come on! Watch your shoulder! No!

1349
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:16,670
{\r原文字幕}Come on! Come on!

1350
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,740
{\r原文字幕}Nora, get outta that!

1351
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,940
{\r原文字幕}Nora, tap!

1352
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,230
{\r原文字幕}She's gotta do something.

1353
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,650
{\r原文字幕}If she doesn't do anything, this fight is over.

1354
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:47,670
{\r原文字幕}Come on!

1355
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:49,400
{\r原文字幕}- Her shoulder. It's about ready to go. - That right arm.

1356
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:51,320
{\r原文字幕}That right arm. Is she gonna tap?

1357
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:02,450
{\r原文字幕}Oh my God! The arm snapped!

1358
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:08,520
{\r原文字幕}Aw, shit!

11359
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:20,640


1360
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:20,640
{\r原文字幕}Are the refs gonna do anything? Her arm!

1361
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:28,810
{\r原文字幕}She's still in the fight! Is the ref gonna stop this?

1362
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:31,210
{\r原文字幕}- He should. - I don't know if he's going to.

1363
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,900
{\r原文字幕}Why didn't you stop it?

1364
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,280
{\r原文字幕}She didn't tap.

1365
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,520
{\r原文字幕}Ref, she didn't tap out! She didn't tap out!

1366
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:40,370
{\r原文字幕}- She didn't tap. - Stop it! Stop it!

1367
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:45,490
{\r原文字幕}You good? Fight! Let's go.

1368
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:54,640
{\r原文字幕}Aight, baby, c'mon! Finish this off! Right now!

1369
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,220
{\r原文字幕}What do I do?

1370
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:58,970
{\r原文字幕}Finish it off, finish her off!

1371
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,350
{\r原文字幕}She's there for the taking, baby! C'mon, go get her!

1372
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,580
{\r原文字幕}Ref, stop it! What are you doing?

1373
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:04,750
{\r原文字幕}What are you doing?

1374
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,750
{\r原文字幕}Nora, you better stop.

1375
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,150
{\r原文字幕}Get outta here, Nora.

1376
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:11,320
{\r原文字幕}Nora, get the fuck out of here.

1377
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:26,100
{\r原文字幕}I think the ref should stop this fight.

1378
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,050
{\r原文字幕}She's not even playing, not defense.

1379
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:30,840
{\r原文字幕}Arm, again.

1380
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,800
{\r原文字幕}There is the other...

1381
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:32,910
{\r原文字幕}Is she gonna tap?

1382
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:39,850
{\r原文字幕}Keep breathing, keep breathing, kid! Keep breathing!

1383
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,960
{\r原文字幕}C'mon Nora! Roll out of it, roll out of it!

1384
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:58,830
{\r原文字幕}Atta girl, atta girl! Woo! Yes!

1385
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,450
{\r原文字幕}Get on top! Get her knee, take her knees!

1386
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:06,310
{\r原文字幕}Take her knee, Nora!

1387
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:10,880
{\r原文字幕}Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

1388
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,010
{\r原文字幕}Okay, alright. Oh my God, the tables have turned here!

1389
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:17,890
{\r原文字幕}So now, Nora has Aisha in a really tight knee lock.

1390
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:20,420
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah, Aisha's in trouble, now. This is... - Yes!

1391
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,760
{\r原文字幕}Is this gonna take the fight?

1392
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,960
{\r原文字幕}I couldn't believe she's still going.

1393
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,660
{\r原文字幕}I have not seen a fight like this in years!

1394
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,410
{\r原文字幕}C'mon, baby! C'mon! Get out, get out!

1395
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:29,730
{\r原文字幕}Get out, roll over!

1396
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,570
{\r原文字幕}Come on. This is incredible!

1397
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:33,980
{\r原文字幕}Nora's still got her. There's...

1398
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,350
{\r原文字幕}Saved by the bell.

1399
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:47,720
{\r原文字幕}That was an incredible first round. Unbelievable.

1400
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,130
{\r原文字幕}It looked like Nora was done from the get-go.

1401
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,290
{\r原文字幕}Like completely out of it,

1402
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:52,920
{\r原文字幕}turning to her corner, turning her back.

1403
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:56,210
{\r原文字幕}- A massive amount of heart on both girls, here. - Yeah.

1404
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:57,830
{\r原文字幕}What a fight!

1405
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:59,930
{\r原文字幕}But lack of D, on both, I would say.

1406
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:01,430
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I would say so.

1407
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:02,930
{\r原文字幕}- There's a lot of offense, not a lot of defense. - Yeah.

1408
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:04,020
{\r原文字幕}Almost a couple submissions.

1409
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,430
{\r原文字幕}Work on the defense a bit.

1410
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,310
{\r原文字幕}Way to survive that round, kid.

1411
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,730
{\r原文字幕}Now, he's gonna have to pop it in now, okay?

1412
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,910
{\r原文字幕}Alright. Take a deep breath.

1413
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,710
{\r原文字幕}You got it. Look at me. C'mon.

1414
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:19,240
{\r原文字幕}Relax, relax. Breathe, breathe, breathe!

1415
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,820
{\r原文字幕}Okay, right here.

1416
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,080
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, shit! - You're good!

1417
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,990
{\r原文字幕}- Is it in? - Okay, okay.

1418
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:30,420
{\r原文字幕}I can't keep doing this. I can't keep going.

1419
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:33,630
{\r原文字幕}That's okay, Nora. It's okay. It's not a problem.

1420
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:35,000
{\r原文字幕}That was a hell of a fight!

1421
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:36,900
{\r原文字幕}No, no, you don't understand.

1422
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,970
{\r原文字幕}I think my mom, she's gonna commit suicide.

1423
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:44,640
{\r原文字幕}Nora, you... your mom's gone.

1424
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:48,560
{\r原文字幕}How did you know? When did you find out? Wha...?

1425
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:53,950
{\r原文字幕}Honey, she passed away two months ago.

1426
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,500
{\r原文字幕}No! No, that's not... No! No, no, no, no!

1427
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,860
{\r原文字幕}That's not, that's not possible!

1428
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:06,430
{\r原文字幕}Hey, hey, hey. I was at the funeral, remember?

1429
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:11,870
{\r原文字幕}And... Yeah, and it took like, over a month for your...

1430
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:16,000
{\r原文字幕}for your feet to heal from the glass cuts, you remember?

1431
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,970
{\r原文字幕}No! No, this can't be right!

1432
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,020
{\r原文字幕}Take a deep breath!

1433
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,810
