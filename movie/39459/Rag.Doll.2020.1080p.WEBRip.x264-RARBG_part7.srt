字幕
She's gonna tap!

16
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:30,764
字幕
Nora, don't!

17
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:33,467
字幕
Get out there! Go get her! Go get her!

01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:47,675
字幕
Come on!

27
01:30:47,676 --> 01:30:49,176
字幕
Her shoulder. It's about ready to go.

28
01:30:49,178 --> 01:30:50,977
字幕
That right arm. Is she gonna tap?

29
01:30:58,187 --> 01:31:02,456
字幕
Oh my God! The arm snapped!

30
01:31:06,862 --> 01:31:08,528
字幕
Aw, shit!

31
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:20,640

Are the refs gonna do anything? Her arm!

32
01:31:26,215 --> 01:31:28,815
字幕
She's still in the fight! Is the ref gonna stop this?

33
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:31,218
字幕
He should. I don't know if he's going to.

34
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,619
字幕
Why didn't you stop it?

35
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:34,571
字幕
She didn't tap.

36
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,522
字幕
Ref, she didn't tap out! She didn't tap out!

37
01:31:36,525 --> 01:31:39,960
字幕
She didn't tap. Stop it! Stop it!

Get outta here, Nora.

46
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:11,057
字幕
Nora, get the fuck out of here.

47
01:32:24,072 --> 01:32:26,106
字幕
I think the ref should stop this fight.

48
01:32:26,975 --> 01:32:30,844
字幕
She's not even playing, not defense. Arm, again.

49
01:32:30,846 --> 01:32:31,778
字幕
There is the other--

50
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,913

51
01:32:36,818 --> 01:32:39,853
字幕
Keep breathing, keep breathing, kid! Keep breathing!

52
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:51,965
字幕
C'mon Nora! Roll out of it, roll out of it!

53
01:32:53,869 --> 01:32:58,838
字幕
Atta girl, atta girl! Woo! Yes!

54
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:06,313
字幕
Get on top! Get her knee, take her knees! Take her knee, Nora!

55
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:10,884
字幕
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

56
01:33:10,886 --> 01:33:13,787
字幕
Okay, alright. Oh my God, the tables have turned here!

57
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:17,891
字幕
So now, Nora has Aisha in a really tight knee lock.

58
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:20,427
字幕
Yeah, Aisha's in trouble, now. This is-- Yes!

59
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,962
字幕
Is this gonna take the fight? I couldn't believe she's still going.

60
01:33:22,965 --> 01:33:25,665
字幕
I have not seen a fight like this in years!

61
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:29,736
字幕
C'mon, baby! C'mon! Get out, get out! Get out, roll over!

62
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:33,907
字幕
Come on. This is incredible! Nora's still got her. There's--

63
01:33:42,351 --> 01:33:44,351
字幕
Saved by the bell.

64
01:33:44,353 --> 01:33:47,721
字幕
That was an incredible first round. Unbelievable.

65
01:33:47,723 --> 01:33:49,956
字幕
It looked like Nora was done from the get-go.

66
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,826
字幕
Like completely out of it, turning to her corner, turning her back.

67
01:33:52,828 --> 01:33:56,062
字幕
A massive amount of heart on both girls, here.

68
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:57,831
字幕
What a fight!

69
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:59,933
字幕
But lack of D, on both, I would say.

70
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:01,435
字幕
Yeah, I would say so.

71
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:02,936
字幕
There's a lot of offense, not a lot of defense.

72
01:34:02,938 --> 01:34:05,105
字幕
- Almost a couple submissions. - Work on the defense a bit.

73
01:34:05,107 --> 01:34:07,107
字幕
Way to survive that round, kid.

74
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:10,243
字幕
Now, he's gonna have to pop it in now, okay?

75
01:34:12,047 --> 01:34:13,913
字幕
Alright. Take a deep breath.

76

01:34:25,127 --> 01:34:27,994
字幕
Is it in? Okay, okay.

81
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,163
字幕
I can't keep doing this. I can't keep going.

82
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:34,624
字幕
That's okay, Nora. It's okay. It's not a problem. That was a hell of a

83
01:34:34,624 --> 01:34:35,001
字幕
fight!

84
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:38,705
字幕
No, no, you don't understand. I think my mom, she's gonna commit suicide.

85
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:44,277
字幕
Nora, you-- your mom's gone.

86
01:34:46,048 --> 01:34:48,248
字幕
How did you know? When did you find out? Wha--?

87
01:34:50,152 --> 01:34:53,953
字幕
Honey, she passed away two months ago.

88
01:34:56,892 --> 01:35:01,828
字幕
No! No, that's not-- No! No, no, no, no! That's not, that's not possible!

89
01:35:02,431 --> 01:35:06,433
字幕
Hey, hey, hey. I was at the funeral, remember?

90
01:35:06,435 --> 01:35:11,871
字幕
And-- Yeah, and it took like, over a month for your--

91
01:35:12,774 --> 01:35:16,009
字幕

92
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,979
字幕
No! No, this can't be right!

93
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:28,021
字幕
Take a deep breath!

94
01:35:28,023 --> 01:35:29,255
字幕

95
01:35:35,864 --> 01:35:37,030

01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:04,224
字幕
I'm not proud of what I had to do.

104
01:36:10,832 --> 01:36:13,299
字幕
You're gonna kick my ass, but I'm gonna stop this.

105
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:17,203
字幕
No, no, no, please! Don't do that! Please! I can do this!

106
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,973
字幕
Look, I know you're right!

107
01:36:19,975 --> 01:36:22,242
