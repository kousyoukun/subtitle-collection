159
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,809
为什么?
Why's that?

160
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,683
贝克先生，法官不会根据传闻重新审理此案。
Mr. Baker, a judge will not reopen this case based on hearsay.

161
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,381
这不可能。
This is not possible.

162
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,731
好吧。
Okay.

163
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:26,343
我们已经用尽了所有可能的法律手段。
We have exhausted every possible legal action.

164
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:30,782
这封信告诉我，你女儿还没有接受她的判决。
This letter tells me that your daughter has not accepted her sentence.

165
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,871
她必须。
And she must.

166
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,698
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,961

如你所愿。

——谢谢。-贝克先生，有时需要希望，有时需要接受。

173
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,717
你最不想给你女儿的就是虚假的希望。
The last thing you want to give your daughter is false hope.

174
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,937
这可能会让她的处境非常糟糕。

175

你明白吗?

谢谢你昨天帮了我女儿玛雅。

我回来晚了一点。
I was a little bit late coming back.

181
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:41,592
你知道的，我们现在住在两套公寓之间，而且我们的新家没有电。
It's, uh, you know, we're between apartments, and we don't have electricity at our new place.

182
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:46,336
对不起,我……我不会说英语。
So... Sorry, I... I don't speak English.

183
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,470
哦,是的。
Oh, yes.

184
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,602
阳台上。是的。

185
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,954
我的英语能力恢复了。
Um, well, my-my English came back to me.

186
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,434
很抱歉声音太大了。
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry for the loud noise.

187
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,045
那是因为我的女朋友奈杰玛。
It's because of my girlfriend Nedjma.

188
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,960
她对我有不好的影响。
She's a bad influence on me.

189
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,658
我,呃,小薇吉妮。
I'm, uh, Virginie.

190
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,789
我是比尔。

191
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,400
你好,比尔。

00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,491
去看我女儿。

194
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:11,666
它很酷。
It's cool.

195
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:17,802
希望我们只在这里多待一两天，但如果你有什么需要，我们就在隔壁。
Well, hopefully we're only here for one or two more days, but if you need anything, you know, we're next door.

196
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,500
谢谢你,女士。
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,589
谢谢你！再见,比尔。

我能帮你什么吗?

219
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,942
我想见Leparq夫人谈谈案子的事。

我们得听听他想说什么。
We need to hear what he has to say.

贝克先生，Maitre Leparq昨天跟你说得很清楚了。
Mr. Baker, Maitre Leparq was very clear with you yesterday.

她不能继续追查这个案子。

227

但如果你想做进一步的调查，我们可以建议你这么做。
But if you wish to pursue a further investigation, we can recommend this.

228

We have worked with the people on this list, and they're all very capable.

I don't care how capable they are. I don't want... - I'm circling the names that you can... - Stop circling that.

232

Let you out a bit late today. They shouldn't do that.

243

你知道他们会准时给你打电话的。
You know they're gonna call you back in on time.

-我帮你洗衣服了。——谢谢。

246
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,691
你把我的信给勒帕克了吗?

247
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,780
是的,当然。
Yeah, of course.

248
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,305
她怎么说?
And what'd she say?

249
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:27,704
她跟我说了你写的关于阿基姆和派对上那个女孩的事。-她怎么说?
Well, uh, she told me what you wrote about Akim - and the girl at the party. - And what'd she say?

250
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:33,971
她说，你知道，她处理过很多这样的案子……爸爸。
Well, she said, you know, she works on a lot of these cases... Dad.

251
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,061
她到底要不要调查?
Is she gonna investigate it or not?

252
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,107
告诉我。
Just tell me.

253
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,589
是的，她会调查的。
Yeah, she's gonna look into it.

254
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,243
真的吗?
Really?

255
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,246
她说的?
She said that?

256
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,073
她说她会调查的?
She said she's gonna look into it?

257
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,988
这是正确的。
That's right.

258
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,164
我告诉她你有多强烈。
I told her how strongly you felt about it.

259
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,602
她需要我做什么吗?
Does she need me to do anything?

260
00:20:55,645 --> 00:21:03,262
不。她说她只是需要点时间，还有…她确实说过，她不想做任何承诺。
No. She said she just needs some time, and, uh... She did say, uh, she didn't want to make any promises.

261
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:07,831
她不想给你任何虚假的希望或类似的东西。-不不不不
She-she didn't want to give you any false hope - or nothing like that. - No, no, no, no, no.

262
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,833
但这仍然很棒。
But that's-that's still great.

263
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,835
Akim存在。
Akim exists.

264
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,402
他杀了莉娜。

265
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,795
我知道。

我知道。

267
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:20,191
你不知道那封信我写了多少遍又重写了多少遍。
You have no idea how many times I-I wrote and then rewrote that letter.

268
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,410
哦,我的上帝。

对不起,女士。

275
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,222
比尔贝克。我打电话问名单的事。
Bill Baker. Called about a list.

276
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,181
请等一下。
One moment please.

277
00:21:53,224 --> 00:22:00,188
我不知道你对这个案子记得多少，但艾莉森来这里上大学，她就是在那里认识了莉娜。
I don't know how much you remember about the case, but Allison came here for college, and that's where she met this girl, Lina.

278
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:06,803
艾莉森和莉娜在一起，有天晚上他们大吵了一架，艾莉森去了一家酒吧。
Allison and Lina were... together, and one night they got in a big fight, and Allison went to a bar.

279
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,371
她就是在那里认识了那个叫阿基姆的。
That's where she met this Akim guy.

280
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,851
他们喝了些饮料。
And they had some drinks.

281
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:17,248
他偷了她的钱包，艾莉森回家后，发现莉娜死了，就报了警。
He stole her purse, and... when Allison got home, she found Lina dead and called the police.

282
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,207
他们一直没能找到这个阿基姆。
And they never could find this Akim.

283
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,775
是他杀了莉娜
He's the one who killed Lina.

284
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,865
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

285
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,434
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

286
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,350
你会说英语，对吧?
You speak English, right?

287
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,743
英语吗?
English?

288
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,702
是的。我是。
Yes. I am.

289
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,052
他妈的。
Fuck.

290
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,316
把信还给我。
Give me back the letter.

291
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,074
贝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

292
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,251
请。
Please.

293
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,166
我的办公室。
My office.

294
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:09,083
这个案子发生的时候我还在服役。
I was in service at the time of this case.

295
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,172
在警察局。
In the police.

296
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,479
你跟这个Okonedo谈过了吗?
Have you talked to this Okonedo?

297
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,046
——教授。——不,先生。
- The professor. - No, sir.

298
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,877
我知道你的律师为什么不想帮忙了。
I see why your lawyer doesn't want to help.

299
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:24,185
某个孩子在派对上听到了谋杀的流言。
Some kid at a party hears gossip about a murder.

300
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,405
也许她还记得这个著名的案子。
Maybe she remembers this famous case.

301
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,233
为什么是现在?那是五年前的事了。
Why now? It was five years ago.

302
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:33,020
我儿子在监狱里待了这么久，五年。
That's... that's how long my kid's been in jail, five years.

303
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,458
她知道我们要见面吗?
Does she know we are meeting?

304
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,894
你的孩子。
Your kid.

305
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,374
不,先生。
No, sir.

306
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,426
你有钱吗，贝克先生?
Are you rich, Mr. Baker?

307
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,819
没有,先生。
No, sir.

308
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,474
这是一个DNA案件。
This is a DNA case.

309
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,302
它意味着两个步骤。
It means two steps.

310
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:57,218
首先，我要找那个年轻人。
First, I look for the young man.

311
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,002
这并不容易。
That will not be easy.

312
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,223
人们会说话。他会试图消失。
People will talk. He will try to disappear.

313
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:13,321
如果我找到这个阿基姆，我就得拿到他的DNA样本然后利用我在警局的关系把它和犯罪现场的DNA做对比。
Then, if I find this Akim, I have to get a sample of his DNA and use my connections in the police to test it against the DNA from the crime scene.

314
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,237
多少钱?
How much?

315
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,899
12000美元?
$12,000?

316
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,814
欧元。
Euros.

317
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,296
谢谢你抽出时间。
Thank you for your time.

318
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,299
贝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

319
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,172
你相信你女儿是无辜的吗?
Do you believe your daughter is innocent?

320
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,174
我知道她是。
I know she is.

321
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:45,048
那也许看到她重获自由就不算什么了。
Then maybe it's not so much to see her go free.

322
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,574
-打扰一下，女士。——是吗?
- Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes?

323
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,185
-能问你个问题吗?-当然可以。
- Ask you a question, please? - Yes, of course.

324
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,319
我只是太蠢了，一个人搞不懂。
I'm just too much of a dumbass to figure this out on my own.

325
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,581
我不会说法语。
I don't speak French.

326
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,975
我能帮你什么吗?
Uh, how can I help you?

327
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:45,413
我在找一个在这里工作的人。
I'm looking for a guy, uh, who works here.

328
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,605
——是吗?-对不起打断一下。
- Oui? - Sorry to interrupt.

329
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:06,434
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

330
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,482
我会。
I do.

331
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,441
找帕特里克·奥科内多。
Looking for Patrick Okonedo.

332
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,358
请坐。
Have a seat please.

333
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,707
没关系。我就在外面等着。
That's all right. I'll wait outside.

334
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,623
不,不,谢谢。加入派对。
No, no, please. Join the party.

335
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,640
这是令人印象深刻的,是吧?
It's impressive, huh?

336
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:44,080
这是一间有博士学位的办公室。
It's the kind of office a PhD will get you.

337
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,952
薄荷茶。
Mint tea.

338
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:51,261
我想和你在派对上跟艾莉森说的那个女孩谈谈。
I want to talk to the girl you told Allison about from the party.

339
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,524
是的。我也这么认为。
Yes. I assumed as much.

340
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,267
说实话，我一直对发生的事感到内疚。
To be honest, I've always felt guilty about what happened.

341
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,269
我应该提醒艾莉森的。
I should've warned Allison.

342
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,184
警告她?关于什么?
Warned her? About what?

343
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:06,537
我知道艾莉森和莉娜睡在一起，但我不知道莉娜搬去和她住了。
Well, I knew Allison and Lina were sleeping together, but I had no idea Lina had moved in with her.

344
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:14,589
我尽量不去怀疑这种类型的关系。贫民区的穷女孩，有钱的美国学生…但我却为自己的天真而感到内疚。
I try to not be cynical about these type of relationships... poor girl from the ghetto, rich American student... but then I end up being guilty of naivete.

345
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,112
艾利森出身贫寒。
Allison grew up poor.

346
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,418
她并不富有。
She isn't rich.

347
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,594
有教养的。
Educated.

348
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,466
人们对文化精英有很多不满。
There is a lot of resentments towards the cultural elite.

349
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,251
但我相信你已经意识到了。
But I'm sure you're aware of that.

350
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,515
派对上那个女孩呢?
What about the girl from the party?

351
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:28,777
——我的学生吗?-是的。
- My student? - Yeah.

352
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,692
她的名字叫Souad。
Her name is Souad.

353
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:35,305
她是外展项目的，莉娜和艾莉森刚认识的时候也参加了这个项目。
She's from the outreach program, the same one Lina and Allison were involved with when they met.

354
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,656
她听到有人在说莉娜的谋杀案吗?
And she heard some guy talking about Lina's murder?

355
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,441
这是她告诉我的。
This is what she told me.

356
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,312
我能和她说话吗?
Could I talk to her?

357
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,010
她会跟你谈的，是的。
She'll talk to you, yes.

358
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,490
我把她的电话号码给你。
I'll give you her phone number.

359
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,669
苏德英语说得不好。
Souad doesn't speak English very well.

360
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,322
你需要有人来翻译。
You will need someone to translate.

361
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:55,108
你能帮我吗?
Oh, could you do that for me?

362
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,676
不，我不愿意。
No, I'd rather not.

363
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,201
我还在负责外展项目。
I'm still running the outreach program.

364
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,681
我不能和你在一起。
I cannot be associated with you.

365
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,684
或者你女儿，在发生了那些事之后。
Or your daughter, after what happened.

366
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,555
不管我个人的看法是什么。
Whatever my personal opinion may be.

367
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,297
我的女儿是无辜的。
My daughter's innocent.

368
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,478
祝你好运。
I wish you good luck.

369
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:31,100
帕特丽夏，恐怕我又需要帮助了。
Hey, Patricia, afraid I need some help again.

370
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:35,757
我明天要参加一个很特别的生日聚会，我把地址弄丢了。
I'm supposed to attend a very special birthday tomorrow, and I lost the address.

371
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,559
你好吗?
Bonjour?

372
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,822
嗨。比尔•贝克。
Hi. It's Bill Baker.

373
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,780
能再重复一遍吗?
Pardon?

374
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,783
-比尔，从酒店来的——啊,比尔。
- Bill, from the hotel. - Ah, Bill.

375
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:06,788
是的，我顺路过来。对不起……-最后一层。——好的。
Yeah, I was stopping by. Sorry to... - Uh, last floor. - All right.

376
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,619
嗨,比尔。
Hi, Bill.

377
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,795
嘿,玛雅。
Hey, Maya.

378
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,579
我有东西给你。
I got something for you.

00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,581
这是一个机器人。
It's a robot.

380
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,721
-嗨。-嗨。对不起,打扰了。

00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,462
不,没关系。进来吧。

哦。
Oh.

00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:34,773
你怎么找到我们的?
How did you find us?

385
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:41,823
前台的女士给了我你的地址，因为我要给一个女孩打电话，但她不会说英语，这是私事。
Oh, the lady at reception gave me your address 'cause there's this girl I need to call, but she don't speak English, and it's kind of personal.

386
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,825
你想让我帮你打个电话。是这样吗?
Ah, you want me to make the call for you. Is that right?

387
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,261
好的，女士，不过我下次再来。
Yes, ma'am, but I'll come back another time.

388
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,133
不,它很好。刚进来。
No, it's fine. Uh, just come in.

389
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,830
让我拿一下手机。

390
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,484
来了。

391
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,793
嘿。
Hey.

392

比尔，这是马赛剧院的creme de la crme。
Bill, this is, uh, the creme de la crme of the Marseille theater scene.

393
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,715
是啊。
Ouais.

394
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,632
我们在做一个，面具练习。
Uh, we're doing this, uh, mask exercise.

395
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:09,808
——好的。-是的。

396
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,593
屋子很乱,请原谅。
Excuse the mess.

397
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,334
这将是我的办公室，但我们还是要搬进去。
This is going to be my office, but we're still moving in.

398
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,205
请坐。
Have a seat.

399
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,554
我要打给谁?
So, who am I calling?

400
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:21,254
嗯…信上的那个女孩。
Um... the girl from the letter.

401
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,865
-是关于案子的吗?——是的,女士。
- Ah, it's about the case? - Yes, ma'am.

402
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,606
我想见见她。
I want to meet with her.

403
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,869
律师没有帮你吗?
Is the lawyer not helping you?

404
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,872
呃，现在我自己来。
Uh, doing it myself for now.

405
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,874
哦。哇。

406
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,354
好吧。嗯…
Okay. Um...

407
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,185
——是的。——嗯…
- Oui. - Um...

408
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,456
多划算啊，我通过我的一个朋友买下了这个地方。
What a great deal, I got this place through this friend of mine.

409
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,286
我很喜欢这里的景色，但有一些缺点。
I fell in love with this view, but, uh, has a few defects.

410
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,810
可能只是一个断路器。
Probably just a circuit breaker.

411
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,420
如果你想的话，我可以帮你看看。
I could look at it if you want.

412
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,945
-是的。你知道怎么做吗?——是的,女士。
- Yeah. You know how to do that? - Yes, ma'am.

413
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,338
那太好了。
Well, that would be great.

414
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,471
Souad?Souad?
Souad? Souad?

415
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,212
是的,你好。Souad?
Oui, bonjour. Souad?

416
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,213
你好。

00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,522
．..比尔贝克。

418
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:16,222
比尔•贝克……哦,不。
Bill Baker... Oh, non.

419
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,705
让我看看。让我看看。
Let me see. Let me see.

420
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,537
-♪你好♪-酷。
- ♪ Hey ♪ - Cool.

421
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,626
♪性感的夫人……♪
♪ Sexy lady... ♪

422
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,892
我不知道它会这样。
I didn't know it did that.

423
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:44,554
这很容易。等一等。那就这样吧。
That-that goes on easy. Hold on. There you go.

424
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,947
看起来不错。
Looks good.

425
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,907
非常感谢。
Merci beaucoup.

426
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,039
再见。
Au revoir.

427
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,608
好吧。她同意明天6点见你。
Okay. She agrees to see you tomorrow at 6:00.

428
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:56,566
好吧。
All right.

429
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,394
她人很好。
Um, she was nice.

430
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,266
有点害羞。
Bit shy.

431
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,268
如果你不讲法语，你要怎么跟她说话?
So how are you gonna talk to her if you don't speak French?

432
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:04,923
这个问题问得很好。
Well, that's a fair question.

433
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,968
我会想办法的。
I'll figure it out.

434
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,578
好吧。
Okay.

435
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,580
如果你需要，我可以过来翻译。
Well, I could come and translate if you need.

436
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,452
你确定吗?
You sure?

437
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,584
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.

438
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:19,502
玛雅有美术课，如果你五点半来，我们就开我的车。
Yeah, Maya has art class, so if you come here at 5:30, then we take my car.

439
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,852
谢谢。
Appreciate it.

440
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:24,507
你告诉我保险丝盒在哪里，我帮你修理断路器。
Uh, you show me where that fuse box is, I'll work on that breaker for you.

441
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,292
不,这是好的。
No, it's okay.

442
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,684
你没必要这么做。
You don't have to do that.

443
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,382
哦,不,不。
Oh, non, non.

444
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,776
把那该死的东西给我。我…来吧。
Just give me that damn thing. I... Come on.

445
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,478
比尔!
Bill!

446
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,351
再见,比尔!
Bye, Bill!

447
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,485
再见。
Bye.

448
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:59,673
我得承认，我上网看了艾莉森的案子。
I have to confess, uh, I went online and I read about Allison's case.

449
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,805
这在当时是个大新闻。
It was a big story at the time.

450
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,895
我是说，媒体很凶，不是吗?
I mean, the-the press was ferocious, no?

451
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,942
你说“f-ferocious”?
Y-You say "f-ferocious"?

452
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,727
-是的，女士，我们是这么说的——是吗?
- Yes, ma'am, we say that. - Yeah?

453
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:13,382
莆田市。
Putain.

454
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,993
笨蛋。
Dumbass.

455
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:18,083
是的,…这里的人都不知道怎么开车。
Yeah, people... they don't know how to drive in this fucking town.

456
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,346
马赛是个疯狂的地方。
It's a crazy place, Marseille.

457
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,130
但比起巴黎，我还是更喜欢巴黎。
But I still prefer it to Paris.

458
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,394
你知道吗，这里的人会互相交谈。
You know, people actually talk to each other here.

459
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,483
而且，它更便宜。
And plus, it's cheaper.

460
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,096
艾利森为什么来这里上学?
And why did Allison come here for school?

461
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,575
我很好奇。
I'm curious.

462
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,969
——不知道。——不是吗?
- Don't know. - No?

463
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,015
是的，她要去俄克拉荷马州立大学。
Yeah, she was going to Oklahoma State.

464
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:41,019
有一天她打电话给我，说"我要去法国"去这里。
She just called me up one day, said, "I'm going to France," to here.

465
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,760
她是独立的。
She's independent.

466
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,502
是的,女士。总是。
Yes, ma'am. Always been.

467
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:47,721
你关闭吗?
Are you close?

468
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,637
你读了她的信。
Well, you read her letter.

469
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,857
她妈妈在哪儿?
And where is her mother?

470
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,685
她通过了。
She passed.

471
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,035
她自杀了。
Killed herself.

472
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,605
艾莉森主要是由她奶奶养大的。
Allison was raised by her grandmother mostly.

473
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,042
我不常在你身边。
I wasn't around much.

474
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,521
你在哪里?
Where were you?

475
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:10,831
在石油钻塔上工作，当我不是的时候却一团糟。
Working oil rigs and... being a fuckup when I wasn't.

476
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,791
做一个单亲妈妈并不容易。
It's not easy being a single parent.

477
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,446
我经常在晚上工作，而玛雅，她很沮丧。
I often work at night, and Maya, she gets really upset.

478
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,709
-你是做什么的?-我是个演员。
- What do you do? - I'm an actress.

479
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,798
-在电视上?——没有。
- Oh, on TV? - No.

480
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,887
剧院。
Theater.

481
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,541
你去剧院吗?
Do you go to theater?

482
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,717
不,女士。
No, ma'am.

483
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,893
——从来没有?——不,女士。
- Never? - No, ma'am.

484
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,419
好吧。
Okay.

485
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,774
谢谢你们跟我聊天。
Uh, thank y'all for talking to me.

486
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:48,651
她在派对上认识的那个人，阿基姆关于他，她有什么线索吗?
So, this guy that she met at the party, Akim... uh, anything she could tell us about him?

487
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,139
她说他很安静，人也很好。
She said he was quiet and nice.

488
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,619
好吗?
Nice?

489
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:08,932
然后他告诉她的朋友他刺伤了一个女孩警察一直没抓到他。
And then he told her friend he'd stabbed a girl and that the police never caught him.

490
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,760
——所以……——好的。
- So... - Okay.

491
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,458
她知道他住哪儿吗?
Does she know where he lives?

492
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,161
她知道他住哪儿吗?
Does she know where he lives?

493
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,645
——Kalliste。——Kalliste ?
- a Kalliste. - Kalliste?

494
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,821
她说他住在另一个项目里。
She says he lives in a different project.

495
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,605
它叫做Kalliste。
It's called Kalliste.

496
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,141
-她在说什么?——没有什么帮助。
- What's she saying? - Nothing helpful.

497
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,623
我,嗯…父亲。

498
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,060
哦,埃里森。

499
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,975
那是我的小女儿。
That's my little girl.

500
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,021
艾利森是我的妈妈。
Allison is my... ma fille.

501
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,110
你明白吗?
You understand?

502
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,902
她不想帮忙。
She doesn't want to help.

503
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:07,904
她能告诉我什么吗?
Can she tell me anything?

504
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,602
这家伙长什么样子?
Wh-What does this guy look like?

505
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,872
-他们要去哪里?——他们要离开。
- Where they going? - They're leaving.

506
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,787
不，不，不。等一下，等一下，等一下。
Uh, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

507
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,181
等等,不,不。等一等。只是等待。不,不。
Wait, no, no. Hold on. Just wait. No, no.

Souad. Hey, Souad! Souad!

比尔，比尔，让他们走，好吗?她的害怕。
Bill, Bill, let them go, okay? She's afraid.

511
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,231
害怕什么?我在跟她说话。
Afraid of what? I'm talking to her.

512
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,928
是啊，但这里不是这样的。
Yeah, but that's not how it works here.

513
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:34,888
那你告诉我是怎么回事，因为这里没人帮我。
Well, you tell me how it works then, 'cause nobody here's doing shit for me.

514
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,977
我什么都为你做，好吗?
I do shit for you, okay?

515
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,154
我们应该去。现在。

516
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200

00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,854
-好吧——好吧?
- Yeah, all right. - All right?

518
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,083
就是这样。Kalliste。
That's it. Kalliste.

519
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,085
她说阿基姆住在那里。
That's where she says Akim lives.

520
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,913
我们可以四处看看吗?
Well, can we go look around?

521
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,610
不。现在不行。
No. Not at this time.

522
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,222
对我们来说不安全。
It's not safe for us.

523
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,832
因为我们是白色?
'Cause we're white?

524
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,010
因为我们不是那里的人。
'Cause we're not from there.

525
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:12,230
有很多交易。
And there's a lot of dealing.

526
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,057
我得做点什么。
Well, I got to do something.

527
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,234
没人会跟你说话的，相信我。
No one will talk to you, trust me.

528
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:20,890
比尔，如果没有阿基姆呢?
Bill, what if there's no Akim?

529
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,892
有。
There is.

530
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:26,766
好吧，但他们在调查过程中没找到这个人。
Okay, but they never found this person during the investigation.

531
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,289
我女儿不是骗子。
My daughter's not a liar.

532
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,899
不，我没说她是。
No, I didn't say she was.

533
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:33,599
只是我读到的所有关于这个案子的资料…你现在算是专家了吗?
It's just that everything I read about the case... So you're some kind of expert now?

534
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,037
不,我不是。
No, I'm not.

535
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,609
新闻界反对我们。
The press was against us.

536
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:49,136
他们只关心艾莉森和某个阿拉伯女孩上床。
All they cared about was Allison was sleeping with some Arab girl.

537
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,662
一群假新闻的人渣。
Bunch of... fake news scumbags.

538
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,187
所以你才打了那个英国记者?
That's why you punched that English reporter?

539
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:02,062
我当时正在喝酒。
I was drinking then.

540
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,117
你告诉奶奶莱帕克的事了吗?
Hey, did you tell Gram about Leparq?

541
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,989
不。
No.

542
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,297
不，我不想在我们了解更多之前让她抱太大希望。
No, I didn't want to get her hopes up until we know more.

543
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,299
你奶奶，她上年纪了。
She's getting on, your grandmother.

544
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,303
我昨天和法官见了面。
Oh, I had a meeting with the judge yesterday.

545
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,306
噢,是吗?关于什么?
Oh, yeah? About what?

546
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,874
我三个月后就要假释审查了。
Well, I have my parole review coming up in about three months.

547
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:35,051
这就是我一个月有一天能离开这里的原因。
And, uh, it's the thing where I get out of here one day a month.

548
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,444
是的,好的。
Yeah, okay.

549
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,099
-他怎么说?——她。她说。
- So what'd he say? - She. She said.

550
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:44,452
你知道，只要我表现良好，就不会有问题。
Uh, you know, as long as my behavior remained good, shouldn't be a problem.

551
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,760
我想说，去他的假释。
I felt like saying, "Fuck parole.

552
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,805
我的律师正在想办法让我永远离开这里"
My lawyer's working on getting me out of here for good."

553
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,416
不，我们还不知道，艾丽。
No, we don't know that yet, Ally.

554
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,809
-你得继续…-我知道，我知道，爸爸。
- You got to keep... - I know, I know, I know, Dad.

555
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,986
我没那么说。但我想这么做。
I-I didn't say that. But I wanted to.

556
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,033
Leparq办公室的人也在那里。
And... somebody from Leparq's office was there.

557
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,470
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

558
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:07,301
是的。我没见过她，但我问她调查进展如何。
Yeah. I never met her, but I asked her how the investigation was going.

559
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,825
她跟你说什么了?
What'd she tell you?

560
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:14,047
她说她什么都不知道，但她还说她刚开始在那里工作。
She said she didn't know anything about it, but she also said she just started working there.

561
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,876
勒帕克可能会自己处理。
Leparq's probably taking care of it herself.

562
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,356
这是个大案子。
It's a big case.

563
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,835
是的。
Yeah.

564
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,837
我告诉她我想和莱帕克谈谈。
I told her I wanted to talk to Leparq.

565
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,361
她应该随时通知我们。
She should be keeping us informed.

566
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,319
-你懂我的意思吗?-我会跟她说的
- You know what I mean? - I'll talk to her.

567
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:32,718
好吧。嗯…过几天见。
Okay. Well... I'll see you in a couple days.

568
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:36,199
爸，你能不能在马赛多待一会儿?
Uh, Dad, do you think that you could stay in Marseille a little longer?

569
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,940
以防万一。
Just in case something comes up.

570
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,160
是的，我可以。
Yeah, I could do that.

571
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:43,206
我去检查一下工作情况。
I'll check in on work and stuff.

572
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,819
如果你需要的话，我可以让奶奶给你电汇钱。
I-I can have Gram wire you some money if you need.

573
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,777
不，不，别这样。我会想办法的。
No, no, don't do that. I-I'll figure it out.

574
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,257
谢谢,爸爸。
Thanks, Dad.

575
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,912
再见。
Bye.

576
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:08,231
嗯,马克斯。
Uh, Max.

577
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,842
你好。
Salut.

578
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,906
——协议。——嗯。
- D'accord. - Ay.

579
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:20,347
现在，一旦石油公司有了租约…给我，M。
Now, once the oil company has a lease... Give it here, M.

580
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,479
来吧。
Come on.

581
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:27,180
一旦石油公司拿到租约，他们就会雇佣一家钻井公司。
Once that oil company has that lease, they hire a drilling company.

582
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:28,964
我就是为他工作的
That's who I work for.

583
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:32,402
然后我们到了那里，把所有的东西组装起来。
And then we get there, we rig up and we put all that shit together.

584
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:37,190
一旦装备好了，我们就开始挖洞。
Once we have that rig up, we start making hole.

585
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,974
这就是钻工的工作。
That's what a roughneck does.

586
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,106
我们打洞。
We make hole.

587
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,500
好吧，测试一下。
All right, test it.

588
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,328
继续冲吧
Go on, flush it.

589
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,026
得到它。
Get it.

590
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,244
——冲洗。——啊,冲洗。
- Flush. - Ah, flush.

591
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,420
-是的。——是吧。
- Yeah. - D'accord.

592
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,248
冲洗。
Flush.

593
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,555
- Ca va ?-当然了，ca va!
- Ca va? - Hell yeah, ca va!

594
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,344
比尔,来了。
Bill, come.

595
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,520
到这里来。
Come here.

596
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,913
过来看看这个。
Come and see this.

597
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,567
Nedjma是一个技术天才。
Nedjma is a technical genius.

598
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,569
我不是天才。我只是年轻。
I'm not a genius. I'm just younger.

599
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,443
-好吧…-这些是网上的吗?
- Okay... - These are online or some shit?

600
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:17,491
这些都是Souad和她那个贱朋友的Instagram账号。
These are all from Instagram accounts of Souad and her bitchy friend.

601
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,102
这些照片都是派对上拍的。
And these photos are all from the party.

602
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,408
你们怎么拿到的?
How'd y'all get them?

603
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:29,895
我注册了一个虚假的Instagram账号，跟踪了苏德和她可爱的朋友萨米拉，然后定位了苏德看到这家伙时参加的派对。
I set up a false Instagram account, followed Souad and her lovely friend whose name is Samira, and then geotagged the party Souad was at when she saw this guy.

604
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:33,246
所以阿基姆有可能在其中一张照片里。
So there's a chance Akim is in one of these photos.

605
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,253
．..阿拉伯人，皮肤白皙。
...Arab and light skin.

606
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,037
是啊，肤色浅，个子高。
Yeah, uh, light skin, yeah, and tall.

607
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:52,047
我们要把它们打印出来，然后你可以拿给艾莉森看。
So we're going to print them up, and then you can show them to Allison.

608
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,355
-不，我不会那么做的。——为什么?
- No, I'm not gonna do that. - Why?

609
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,400
如果阿基姆在那里，她会知道的。
If Akim is there, she'll know.

610
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,141
我也不在乎
I don't care.

611
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,274
我不会那么做的。我不会这么对她的。
I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna do it to her.

612
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,928
我得保护她。
I got to protect her.

613
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,407
我不明白你的意思。
I don't understand.

614
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,410
你为什么对艾莉森这么固执?
Wh-why you're being so stubborn about Allison?

615
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,936
我们现在要做的是回到苏阿德我们拿到了那些照片。
What we should do is go back to Souad now we got those pictures.

616
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:15,505
我们从Instagram上偷了这些照片，所以我不确定这是不是个好主意。
Well, we stole these photos from Instagram, so I'm not sure this is a good idea.

617
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,335
——嗯…-我能说句话吗?
- Well... - Can I say something?

618
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:20,989
是啊,说吧。
Ouais, vas-y.

619
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:25,254
马赛有其他人见过阿基姆还是只有艾莉森?
Did anyone else in Marseille see this Akim guy or just Allison?

620
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,039
酒吧老板。
Bar owner.

621
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,257
他们相遇的地方。
Where they met.

622
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:29,737
他在审判现场。
He was at the trial.

623
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,565
-他什么都没做，但是…——好的。
- He didn't do shit, but... - Okay.

624
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,089
那个酒吧叫什么来着?的叫什么名字?
Uh, what's it called, the bar? What's the name?

625
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,961
我不记得名字了。
I don't remember the name of it.

626
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:38,616
-就在她公寓附近-是的。好吧。
- It was near her apartment. - Yeah. Okay.

627
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:39,704
-嗯-嗯
- Mm. - Mm.

628
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,332
好吧。
Okay.

629
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,508
比尔，你投票给特朗普了吗?
Bill, did you vote for Trump?

630
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,989
不。
No.

631
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,469
啊。瞧。
Ah. Voila.

632
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,733
-我没有投票。——什么?
- I didn't vote. - What?

633
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,605
-你为什么不投票?-有案底。
- Why didn't you vote? - Got a record.

634
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,129
我被逮捕。
I was arrested.

635
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,218
这种情况下他们不让你投票。
They don't let you vote when that happens.

636
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,586
就在那儿，就在那个角落。
It's there, around that corner.

637
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:44,682
你的朋友，奈杰玛…她因为你帮了我而生气吗?
Your friend, uh, Nedjma... she mad at you for helping me?

638
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,772
不要担心Nedjma;她通常怀有敌意。
Don't worry about Nedjma; she's generally hostile.

639
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:51,689
她对我保护欲很强，但她是我的好朋友。
You know, she's very protective with me, but she's a good friend.

640
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,169
她帮我照顾玛雅。
She helps me with Maya.

641
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,781
玛雅的父亲在哪儿?
Where's Maya's father?

642
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:00,088
科西嘉岛，在海滩上开夜总会。
Corsica, running a nightclub on the beach.

643
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,612
他是个放荡的人。
He was a... a fling.

644
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,527
-你是这么说的?——扔,是的。
- That's how you say? - Fling, yeah.

645
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,225
是的。
Yeah.

646
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,748
他访问吗?

647
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:10,055
他以前喜欢，但他不喜欢的时候更好。
He used to, but it's better when he doesn't.

648
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,189
什么?
What?

649
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,192
那是艾莉森住的地方。
That's where Allison lived.

650
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:20,805
21岁。
Twenty-one.

651
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,765
就是在那里发生的吗?
That's where it happened?

652
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,375
是的。
Yeah.

653
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,602
-你好。-你好。
- Bonjour. - Bonjour.

654
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:49,790
他是新老板。
He's the new owner.

655
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,401
案发时他不在现场。
He wasn't there when the crime happened.

656
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,447
他知道我们在哪能找到原来的主人吗?
Does he know where we could find the old owner?

657
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,579
是的,我知道。
Yes, I know.

658
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:57,755

喝我的利润。

660
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,382
Euhm……

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,303
他承认任何人吗?
He recognize anybody?

662
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:41,799
他说了什么?
What's he saying?

663
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,296
莆田市。
Putain.

664
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,646
好吧。生活就是好。我们走吧。
Okay. C'est bon. Let's go.

665
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,778
他说什么?
What'd he say?

666
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,345
什么都没有。他是无用的。
Nothing. He's useless.

667
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,915
嘿。
Hey.

668
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:16,311
嘿!
Hey!

669

嘿!发生了什么事?

00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,881
我很抱歉。我只是…我不能再和那家伙说话了。
I'm sorry. I just, uh... I can't talk to that guy anymore.

671
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,275
他只是说了一些可怕的事情。
He was just saying some horrible things.

672
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:24,885
像什么?
Like what?

673
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,931
就好像他只是想把一个阿拉伯小孩送进监狱?
Like he just wants to put an Arab kid in jail, you know?

674
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,758
他不在乎哪一个。
He doesn't care which one.

675
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,804
就这些吗?
That's it?

676
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,502
就这些吗?你说"就这样"是什么意思?
That's it? What do you mean, "That's it"?

677
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:34,677
他是一个种族主义者。
He's a racist.

678
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,375
好吧，他是个种族主义者。
Okay, he's a racist.

679
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:37,680
我们还是得和他谈谈。
We still got to talk to him.

680
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,682
不。我不跟他说话，不
No. I don't talk to him, no.

681
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,554
他可能知道些什么。

1197

But... it's more money, but it's also more hours, so that means I'll have to pay for a babysitter and I'll be away more from Maya.

我也可以帮玛雅的忙。

想它会。

01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:17,488
昨天已经逝去，♪
♪ Yesterday is dead and gone ♪

1248
01:32:20,056 --> 01:32:22,580
♪明天已经走远…♪

1249
01:32:24,321 --> 01:32:26,149
-嗨。——嗯?
- Hey. - Huh?

1250
01:32:26,192 --> 01:32:28,978
-我有事要问你。——什么?
- I need to ask you something. - What?

1251
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:31,067
你真的有枪吗?
Do you really own a gun?

1252
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,549
哦。
Oh.

1253
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:36,986
两枪。
Two guns.

1254
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:13,196
——嘿,玛雅。——嗯?
- Hey, Maya. - Hmm?

1255
01:33:13,239 --> 01:33:15,285
把我的头盔递给我?
Want to hand me my casque?

1256
01:33:16,503 --> 01:33:18,593
我的盔。我的头盔。我的安全帽。
My casque. My helmet. My hard hat.

1257
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:20,507
——哦。-你能帮我拿过来吗?
- Oh. - Will you get it for me?

1258
01:33:31,214 --> 01:33:33,085
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

1259
01:33:33,129 --> 01:33:35,653
是啊!
Ouais!

1260
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:06,684
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

1261
01:34:06,728 --> 01:34:07,990
哇!
Whoa!

1262
01:34:22,569 --> 01:34:23,527
哦。
Oh.

1263
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,008
哇。
Wow.

1264
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,687
该死，这地方越来越热了。
Damn, the place is heating up.

1265
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:55,124
——什么?-很多粉丝。

1266
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:56,560
坚果。
Going nuts.

1267
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:00,738
应该有人告诉他们，他们赢了。
Someone should tell them they're winning.

1268
01:35:51,267 --> 01:35:53,748
好了，我们走吧。
All right, let's go.

1269
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,782
原谅,原谅,原谅。
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

1270
01:36:53,372 --> 01:36:54,591
比尔。
Bill.

1271
01:36:56,723 --> 01:36:59,204
我好像看到一个工作上的朋友。
Oh, I think I see a friend from work.

1272
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:00,510
想看看是不是他。
Want to see if it's him.

1273
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,852
好了，我们去开货车。

1274
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:40,419
-是你朋友吗?-不，那不是他
- Is it your friend? - No, that wasn't him.

1275
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,510
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hey. - Hey.

1276
01:37:44,554 --> 01:37:46,599
-最近怎么样?——呃,好的。比赛刚刚结束。

很快回家。
Be home soon.

1278
01:37:48,253 --> 01:37:49,776
-好吧，慢慢来。——这是妈妈吗?
- Okay, take your time. - C'est maman?

1279
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,691
-今晚属于你——好的。
- It's your night. - Okay.

1280
01:37:51,735 --> 01:37:53,780
呃，一会儿见。
Uh, see you in a bit.

1281
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,291
Wouah !
Wouah!

1282
01:39:25,437 --> 01:39:26,786
回去睡觉吧。
Go back to sleep.

1283
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,963
继续。
Go on.

1284
01:39:29,006 --> 01:39:30,660
我们要回家了。
We're going home.

1285
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:49,722
Ca。
Ca va.

1286
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,031
贝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

1287
01:39:54,075 --> 01:39:55,902
很高兴再次见到你。
Nice to see you again.

1288
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:56,991
你迟到了。
You're late.

1289
01:39:57,034 --> 01:39:58,949
哦。
Oh.

1290
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,342
Excusez-moi。
Excusez-moi.

1291
01:40:02,866 --> 01:40:04,694
我能为你做什么，贝克先生?
What can I do for you, Mr. Baker?

1292
01:40:06,522 --> 01:40:08,828
我们说过的那个DNA测试我想尽快完成。
That DNA test we talked about... I want to get it done.

1293
01:40:08,872 --> 01:40:12,354
首先，我需要DNA样本。
First I will need, uh, the DNA sample.

1294
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:27,891
我能问问你是怎么弄到这个的吗?
Can I ask you how you got this?

1295
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:29,893
你到底能不能做到?
Can you do it or not?

1296
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:32,722
是的,我能。
Yes, I can.

1297
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:42,601
但我以前是警察，所以我告诉你，为了证明你女儿的清白而犯罪将是一个严重的错误。
But I am an ex-cop, so let me tell you, it will be a serious mistake to commit a crime to prove your daughter innocent.

1298
01:40:42,645 --> 01:40:44,864
这也救不了她。
It will not get her out of jail.

1299
01:40:44,908 --> 01:40:46,475
它会把你送进去。
And it will send you in.

1300
01:40:46,518 --> 01:40:48,868
-你明白吗?-你能多快?
- Do you understand? - How fast can you do it?

1301
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,655
这很难说。
It's hard to say.

1302
01:40:52,698 --> 01:40:56,093
至少一个星期，但要花你不少钱。
A week at least, but it will cost you.

1303
01:40:56,137 --> 01:40:57,877
这是3000年了。
Here's 3,000 now.

1304
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:01,403
你完成后我会再给你三千块，但肯定比一周快。
I'll give you another 3,000 when you get it done, but it's got to be quicker than a week.

1305
01:41:01,446 --> 01:41:04,058
就算匹配，我也得找到这个人。
Even if it matches, I still have to find this guy.

1306
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:05,755
不,你没有。
No, you don't.

1307
01:41:05,798 --> 01:41:07,539
你知道他在哪吗?
You know where he is?

1308
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:13,980
他还是有可能在结果出来之前消失。
He could still disappear before the results come back.

1309
01:41:14,024 --> 01:41:16,809
他不会。搞定后给我打电话。
He won't. Call me when you get it done.

1310
01:41:31,215 --> 01:41:32,912
来吧。
Come on.

1311
01:41:37,874 --> 01:41:39,441
玛雅?
Maya?

1312
01:41:42,618 --> 01:41:44,010
玛雅?
Maya?

1313
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,582
嘿,玛雅?
Hey, Maya?

1314
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:56,066
嘿。
Hey.

1315
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,633
嘿。
Hey.

1316
01:41:57,676 --> 01:41:59,069
-这真是一种问候。-你看到玛雅了吗?
- This is quite a greeting. - You seen Maya?

1317
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,505
-我在洗澡。-是的。
- I was in the shower. - Yeah.

1318
01:42:00,549 --> 01:42:02,116
她正在院子里踢足球。
She's playing soccer in the courtyard.

1319
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,944
对不起，我迟到了。
I'm sorry I'm late.

1320
01:42:04,988 --> 01:42:09,514
-哦，没关系。——……你不想问我第一天上班的情况吗?
- Oh, that's all right. - It... Don't you want to ask me about my first day at work?

1321
01:42:09,558 --> 01:42:11,125
嗯,是的,是的。怎么去了?
Uh, yeah, yeah. How'd it go?

1322
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:31,188
——比尔?——嗯?
- Bill? - Hmm?

1323
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:33,495
山洞里的那个人是谁?
Who is the man in the cave?

1324
01:42:36,628 --> 01:42:37,847
在山洞里吗?
In the cave?

1325
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:40,719
用的工具。
With the tools.

1326
01:42:40,763 --> 01:42:42,808
我看见他。
I saw him.

1327
01:42:48,684 --> 01:42:51,730
我需要你的帮助。
Um, I'm gonna need your help.

1328
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:53,819
好吧?
Okay?

1329
01:42:53,863 --> 01:42:56,822
因为这是个秘密。
'Cause it's a secret.

1330
01:42:56,866 --> 01:42:59,564
你不能告诉任何人。
You can't tell anyone.

1331
01:42:59,608 --> 01:43:01,000
甚至你的妈妈。
Even your mom.

1332
01:43:01,044 --> 01:43:02,611
好吧?
Okay?

1333
01:43:04,265 --> 01:43:06,180
他是个坏人。
He's a bad man.

1334
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:08,747
他马上就走了。
He'll be gone soon.

1335
01:43:09,879 --> 01:43:11,837
这是我们之间的秘密。
It's gonna be our secret.

1336
01:43:11,881 --> 01:43:13,578
好吧?
Okay?

1337
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:19,541
这是我的女孩。
That's my girl.

1338
01:45:20,836 --> 01:45:22,185
大便。
Shit.

1339
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:55,349
事实上，我学到了一些新东西。
I learned something new actually.

1340
01:45:56,393 --> 01:45:58,830
这对我帮助很大。
It's helped me a lot.

1341
01:45:58,874 --> 01:46:01,442
这东西叫"浴缸"
It's something called the "Mektub."

1342
01:46:01,485 --> 01:46:04,488
一个护士告诉我的。
A nurse told me about it.

1343
01:46:04,532 --> 01:46:06,011
它是关于接受。
It's about acceptance.

1344
01:46:06,055 --> 01:46:08,362
接受什么?
Acceptance of what?

1345
01:46:09,406 --> 01:46:10,973
你的命运。
Your fate.

1346
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:15,107
它帮我停止挣扎。
It's helping me to stop struggling so much.

1347
01:46:15,151 --> 01:46:17,414
停止质疑一切。
Stop questioning everything.

1348
01:46:19,111 --> 01:46:24,378
你只要拥抱你的命运，学会平静地生活。
You just embrace your fate and learn to live in peace with it.

1349
01:46:26,075 --> 01:46:28,425
这是穆斯林的想法。
It's a Muslim idea.

1350
01:46:28,469 --> 01:46:48,184
它是关于放弃所有的羞愧和内疚，这些让你沮丧，让你感到无助。
It's about... letting go of all of that...shame...and guilt that pushes you down and keeps you down and makes you feel so powerless.

1351
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:51,970
在很长一段时间里，我都是这种感觉。
And that's how I felt for a really long time.

1352
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:57,106
无能为力和遗忘。
Powerless and forgotten.

1353
01:46:59,325 --> 01:47:04,243
这让生活变得非常艰难。
And... that makes living really hard.

1354
01:47:05,244 --> 01:47:07,290
你懂我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

1355
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:13,122
但是你是无辜的。
But you're innocent.

1356
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,865
所以我们要继续战斗。
So we got to keep fighting.

1357
01:47:16,908 --> 01:47:19,955
我是无辜的并不重要，爸爸。
It doesn't matter that I'm innocent, Dad.

1358
01:47:21,217 --> 01:47:23,262
这与正义无关。
It's not about justice.

1359
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:28,050
这是关于寻找平静。
It's about finding peace.

1360
01:48:06,088 --> 01:48:09,918
我不知道你在说什么，但你是在白费口舌。
I don't know what you're saying, but you're wasting your breath.

1361
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:14,531
等DNA出来了，我们就知道了。
We're gonna wait for that DNA, and then we'll know.

1362
01:48:14,575 --> 01:48:17,926
她问我。她付给我。
She ask me. She pay me.

1363
01:48:17,969 --> 01:48:19,362
你还要水吗?
You want more water?

1364
01:48:19,405 --> 01:48:22,496
艾莉森，她说，去吧。你把莉娜弄晕了。”
Allison, she say, "Go. You put Lina out."

1365
01:48:22,539 --> 01:48:23,497
-够了，现在。-“给你钱。”
- That's enough, now. - "Money for you."

1366
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:25,368
这就够了,现在。
That's enough, now.

1367
01:48:25,411 --> 01:48:27,588
她让我拿着。
She tell me take it.

1368
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:29,154
她给了我科利尔。
She gave me collier.

1369
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:30,286
“你把它。
"You take it.

1370
01:48:30,329 --> 01:48:31,983
——钱。”——在这里。
- Money after." - Here.

1371
01:48:32,027 --> 01:48:33,507
喝。
Drink that.

1372
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:34,899
继续。
Go on.

1373
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:38,250
联合国科利尔。“你自己拿去吧。”
Un collier. "You take it for you."

1374
01:48:38,294 --> 01:48:40,426
科利尔。黄金。
Collier. Gold.

1375
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,212
像这样。像这样。
Like this. Like this.

1376
01:48:43,255 --> 01:48:45,519
这条项链吗?我不想那样。
The necklace? I-I don't want that.

1377
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:47,477
不!
No!

1378
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:48,870
她给了我。
She gave me.

1379
01:48:48,913 --> 01:48:51,350
她说,“走吧。你把莉娜弄晕了。
She say, "Go. You put Lina out.

1380
01:48:51,394 --> 01:48:54,310
现在的项链。钱后。”
Necklace now. Money after."

1381
01:48:54,353 --> 01:48:56,007
你根本说不通。
You're not even making sense.

1382
01:48:56,051 --> 01:48:57,574
是时候闭嘴了。
Time to shut the fuck up.

1383
01:48:57,618 --> 01:48:59,489
S-Stillwater !
S-Stillwater!

1384
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:04,973
你想说什么?
What'd you say?

1385
01:49:05,016 --> 01:49:07,105
科利尔。
The collier.

1386
01:49:07,149 --> 01:49:09,020
他说“静”。
He say "Stillwater."

1387
01:49:10,021 --> 01:49:11,893
黄金。
Gold.

1388
01:49:11,936 --> 01:49:18,290
她说……“这样做。让她走了。
She say... "Do it. Make her go.

1389
01:49:18,334 --> 01:49:20,292
让她出去。”
Make her go out."

1390
01:49:39,616 --> 01:49:40,617
嘿。
Hey.

1391
01:49:40,661 --> 01:49:42,140
-嗨。-你去哪儿了?
- Hey. - Where were you?

1392
01:49:42,184 --> 01:49:44,534
我从波梅特家走回来的。
I walked back from the, uh, Baumettes.

1393
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,536
我们得去见伊莎贝尔。
We have to go and see Isabelle.

1394
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,016
如果我们现在不走，就会迟到。
We'll be late if we don't leave now.

1395
01:49:48,059 --> 01:49:51,367
做的,嗯…我一定要走吗?
Do, uh... do I have to go?

1396
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:53,064
是的,当然。
Yes, of course.

1397
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:54,718
我告诉她你要来。
I told her you were coming.

1398
01:49:54,762 --> 01:49:57,242
请快点。玛雅……
Hurry up, please. Maya...

1399
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,638
是的,妈妈。
Oui, maman.

1400
01:50:01,682 --> 01:50:06,991
伊莎贝尔就像是我们的教母。
So, Isabelle is a sort of like godmother for us.

1401
01:50:07,035 --> 01:50:08,689
玛雅真的很爱她。

好吧,你会看到。
Well, you'll see.

1403
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:13,432
这真是马赛的另一边。
This is really the other side of Marseille.

1404
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:20,222
Marraine !
Marraine!

1405
01:50:20,265 --> 01:50:21,615
啊。
Ah.

1406
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:51,645
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

1407
01:50:51,688 --> 01:50:54,386
她离开那天我送她的金项链。
The gold necklace I gave her the day she left.

1408
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:56,214
上面写着"静水"
Said "Stillwater" on it.

1409
01:50:56,258 --> 01:50:58,129
是的，我记得。什么呢?
Yeah, I remember it. What about it?

1410
01:50:58,173 --> 01:51:00,305
你还记得吗，她在庭审时戴着它吗?
D-Do you remember, was she wearing it at the trial?

1411
01:51:00,349 --> 01:51:02,351
她还戴着吗?
Did she still have it on?

1412
01:51:02,394 --> 01:51:04,135
你在搞什么，比尔?
What are you getting into, Bill?

1413
01:51:04,179 --> 01:51:07,182
我们去拿她的东西的时候，你看到了吗?
Wh-When we went to get her stuff, did you see it?

1414
01:51:07,225 --> 01:51:08,444
哦，我不知道。
Oh, I don't know.

1415
01:51:08,487 --> 01:51:10,359
我不记得了。为什么?
I don't remember. Why?

1416
01:51:10,402 --> 01:51:12,317
我晚点再打给你，莎伦。再见。
I'll talk to you later, Sharon. Bye.

1417
01:51:14,406 --> 01:51:16,321

1421
01:51:23,372 --> 01:51:24,503
是吗?
Are you?

1422
01:51:24,547 --> 01:51:26,505
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

1423
01:51:26,549 --> 01:51:29,291
你看起来心不在焉。
You just seem distrait.

好的,来了。
Okay, come.

1434
01:52:15,816 --> 01:52:18,862
迪罗莎先生，我是比尔·贝克。

呃，有点紧急。

1437
01:53:03,254 --> 01:53:05,126
您好,夫人。
Bonjour, madame.

1438
01:53:05,169 --> 01:53:06,301
你好。

01:53:51,215 --> 01:53:52,608
再见。
Au revoir.

1441
01:54:15,587 --> 01:54:19,809
你知道吗，我小时候在学校也经常打架。
You know, I used to fight a lot at school when I was a kid, too.

1442
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:22,856
但这并不好。战斗?不。
But that's not good. Fight? No.

1443
01:54:26,381 --> 01:54:28,426
你确定不要吗?
You sure you don't want this?

1444
01:54:29,906 --> 01:54:33,214
山洞里的那个人，你要杀了吗?
The man in the cave, you will kill?

1445
01:54:33,257 --> 01:54:35,216
什么?不。
What? No.

1446
01:54:35,259 --> 01:54:36,826
当然不是。
Of course not.

1447
01:54:42,832 --> 01:54:45,879
我永远不会做任何伤害你和你母亲的事。
I would never, ever do anything to hurt you or your mother.

1448
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:46,880
从来没有。
Never.

1449
01:54:50,405 --> 01:54:52,276
因为我爱你们两个。
Because I love both of you.

1450
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,887
这么多。
So much.

1451
01:54:54,931 --> 01:54:56,498
我做的事。
I do.

1452
01:54:59,544 --> 01:55:01,677
你只要相信我就行了
You just have to trust me.

1453
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,896
好吧?
Okay?

1454
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,248
好吧。
Okay.

1455
01:55:29,879 --> 01:55:32,534
贝克先生，有话跟你说。
Mr. Baker, a word please.

1456
01:55:32,577 --> 01:55:34,318
警察。
Police.

1457
01:55:34,362 --> 01:55:37,278
我能看一下您的身份证吗?
Can I see your I.D. please?

1458
01:55:37,321 --> 01:55:39,367
你的身份证，贝克先生。
Your I.D., Mr. Baker.

1459
01:55:44,589 --> 01:55:45,982
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1460
01:55:46,026 --> 01:55:47,941
摘下你的帽子。
Take off your cap.

1461
01:55:52,336 --> 01:55:54,556
好吧。谢谢你！
Okay. Thank you.

1462
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:59,604
贝克先生，我的同事们要把这个小女孩带进去。
So, Mr. Baker, my colleagues are gonna take the little girl inside.

1463
01:55:59,648 --> 01:56:01,302
好吧?
Okay?

1464
01:56:01,345 --> 01:56:02,781
——不,比尔。-好吧，好吧，好吧。
- No, Bill. - Okay, all right, all right, all right.

1465
01:56:02,825 --> 01:56:04,522
没关系。没关系。
It's okay. It's all right.

1466
01:56:04,566 --> 01:56:05,741
-你跟她去——没有。
- You go with her. - No.

1467
01:56:05,784 --> 01:56:07,438
万事快调。万事快调。
Tout va bien. Tout va bien.

1468
01:56:07,482 --> 01:56:08,526
没关系。
It's all right.

1469
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:12,791
你都是对的。
You're all right.

1470
01:56:12,835 --> 01:56:14,837
贝克先生，看着我。
So, Mr. Baker, look at me.

1471
01:56:16,491 --> 01:56:18,841
你们这里有地下室吗?
Do you have a basement here?

1472
01:56:20,843 --> 01:56:22,410
是或否?
Yes or no?

1473
01:56:23,889 --> 01:56:25,021
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1474
01:56:25,065 --> 01:56:27,632
好吧。请把钥匙给我。
Okay. Give me the keys please.

1475
01:56:49,959 --> 01:56:51,004
请。
Please.

1476
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:08,412
停。
Stop.

1477
01:57:27,605 --> 01:57:29,085
停。
Stop.

1478
01:57:45,667 --> 01:57:46,929
你有钥匙吗?
Do you have the key?

1479
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:50,063
贝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

1480
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:51,760
他有它。
He's got it.

1481
01:58:16,045 --> 01:58:18,743
让我们上楼。
Let's go upstairs.

1482
01:58:24,749 --> 01:58:26,534
坐下。
Sit.

1483
01:58:58,914 --> 01:59:00,089
来吧。
Viens.

1484
01:59:03,527 --> 01:59:04,833
去吧，亲爱的
Vas-y, cherie.

1485
01:59:19,848 --> 01:59:20,849
是的。
Oui.

1486
01:59:24,287 --> 01:59:25,984
——是的。——啊。
- Oui. - Ah.

1487
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,517
是的。
Oui.

1488
01:59:45,047 --> 01:59:46,222
啊。
Ah.

1489
02:00:16,861 --> 02:00:18,036
——非?——不。
- Non? - Non.

1490
02:00:19,647 --> 02:00:21,214
——是的。

1491
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:13,918
好吧。
Okay.

1492
02:01:40,336 --> 02:01:43,383
Virginie，我不是故意的…你怎么找到他的?
Virginie, I didn't mean to... How did you find him?

1493
02:01:45,254 --> 02:01:47,169
纯粹的机会。
Pure chance.

1494
02:01:47,212 --> 02:01:48,866
足球比赛。
The soccer game.

1495
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:52,000
玛雅?
With Maya?

1496
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:01,314
你让她撒谎了吗?
Did you ask her to lie?

1497
02:02:02,967 --> 02:02:04,665
是吗?
Did you?

1498
02:02:05,796 --> 02:02:08,321
我从没想过把你和玛雅牵扯进来。
I never meant to involve you or Maya.

1499
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:14,022
——我知道…——你……
- I know... - You...

1500
02:02:16,024 --> 02:02:17,721
你现在得走了。
You have to leave now.

1501
02:02:21,246 --> 02:02:24,424
好吧。你收拾东西走人。
Okay. You pack your things, you leave.

1502
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,352
我可以进来吗?
May I come in?

1503
02:02:45,227 --> 02:02:46,794
玛雅?
Maya?

1504
02:02:52,234 --> 02:02:54,236
你不想跟我说话吗?
You don't want to talk to me?

1505
02:02:55,542 --> 02:02:57,326
好吧。
All right.

1506
02:03:00,068 --> 02:03:01,765
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1507
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,945
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1508
02:03:14,256 --> 02:03:15,431
我爱你。
I love you.

1509
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:49,509
比尔。
Bill.

1510
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,772
非。
Non.

1511
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:49,960
贝克先生，我带来了一个特别的消息。
Mr. Baker, I've come with some extraordinary news.

1512
02:04:50,004 --> 02:04:52,354
你女儿案子的法官今早给我打电话了。
The judge in your daughter's case called me this morning.

1513
02:04:52,397 --> 02:04:54,095
新的证据已经浮出水面。
New evidence has surfaced.

1514
02:04:54,138 --> 02:04:59,317
显然，一个退休警察找到了与未知样本匹配的DNA。
Apparently, a retired cop came up with a DNA match on the unknown sample.

1515
02:04:59,361 --> 02:05:06,194
它也与四年前警方在一桩入室盗窃案中收集的样本相符。
It also matched a sample the police collected on a burglary case four years ago, after the trial.

1516
02:05:06,237 --> 02:05:07,543
他们抓到他了吗?
Did they catch him?

1517
02:05:07,587 --> 02:05:10,024
不,还没有。
No, not yet.

1518
02:05:10,067 --> 02:05:13,462
但我们需要证明的只是足够的怀疑。
But all we need to prove is sufficient doubt.

1519
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:18,336
所以即使他们找不到嫌疑人，他们也很有可能会释放艾莉森。
So even if they can't find the suspect, there's a real chance they will release Allison.

1520
02:05:19,337 --> 02:05:26,214
事实上，法官已经同意重新调查，这几乎是闻所未闻的。
In fact, the judge has already agreed to reopen the investigation, which is almost unheard of.

1521
02:05:27,258 --> 02:05:29,565
我认为这只会发生在马赛。
I think this could only happen in Marseille.

1522
02:05:36,703 --> 02:05:39,227
谢谢你来告诉我，夫人。
Thank you for coming to tell me, ma'am.

1523
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:44,537
贝克先生，这对你的家庭来说可能是最好的结果。
Mr. Baker, this is the best possible outcome for your family.

1524
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:46,060
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

1525
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:48,018
我做的事。
I do.

1526
02:05:49,063 --> 02:05:50,543
谢谢你,女士。
Thank you, ma'am.

1527
02:06:16,090 --> 02:06:17,613
去,会!
Go, Pokes!

1528
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:27,188
我告诉过你我们会把女儿带回家的，我们确实这么做了。
I told you we were gonna bring our girl home, and that's exactly what we did.

欢迎回家,埃里森。

1532

你是反社会?

1533
02:07:36,605 --> 02:07:38,215
你对吧?
You all right?

1534
02:07:44,744 --> 02:08:00,629
你去马赛那天，莎伦和我开车送你去机场，到了机场后，我觉得很尴尬，因为我没有礼物，所以我去了礼品店。
The day you left for Marseille, Sharon and I drove you to the airport, and... when we got there, I was embarrassed I didn't have a present or nothing, so I went to the gift shop.

我想给你买本书或者钥匙链什么的。
I thought I'd get you a book or a key chain or something.

然后我看到了这条项链。

1539
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:19,561
上面写着"静水"

1540
02:08:33,662 --> 02:08:36,578
我不希望发生这种事。
I didn't want it to happen.

1541
02:08:40,277 --> 02:08:44,760
他说他会帮我把她弄出公寓，仅此而已。
He told me that he would just help me get her out of the apartment, that's all.

1542
02:08:46,588 --> 02:08:49,156
我不想让她死。

我爱她。

你觉得我是个怪物?

1546
02:09:01,646 --> 02:09:02,778
你是我的女儿。
You're my daughter.

1547
02:09:02,822 --> 02:09:05,781
我…我从来没有那样想过。
I... I could never think that.

1548
02:09:08,697 --> 02:09:11,178
爸爸，我们怎么了?
Dad, what is wrong with us?

1549
02:09:14,442 --> 02:09:17,140
我不知道，宝贝。
I don't know, baby girl.

1550
02:09:17,184 --> 02:09:19,142
我不知道。

我也是。
Me, too.

睡不着。

去散步，最后来到了这里。

我很高兴你这么做了。

1564

你想念他们吗?

1565
02:11:17,434 --> 02:11:18,958
我做的事。
I do.

1566
02:11:20,568 --> 02:11:21,917
你能回去吗?

生活是残酷的。

1572
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:03,437
这里的一切看起来都一样。

1573

什么都没有改变。

不，艾丽，我没有。
