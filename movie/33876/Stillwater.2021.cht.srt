貝克先生?——是的,女士。

我只是想佔用你幾分鐘時間。

158
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:12,416
很抱歉，貝克先生，但我不能滿足您女兒的要求。
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker, but I cannot honor your daughter's request.

159
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,809
為什麼?
Why's that?

160
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,683
貝克先生，法官不會根據傳聞重新審理此案。
Mr. Baker, a judge will not reopen this case based on hearsay.

161
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,381
這不可能。
This is not possible.

162
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,731
好吧。
Okay.

163
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:26,343
我們已經用盡了所有可能的法律手段。
We have exhausted every possible legal action.

164
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:30,782
這封信告訴我，你女兒還沒有接受她的判決。
This letter tells me that your daughter has not accepted her sentence.

165
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,871
她必須。
And she must.

166
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,698
你明白嗎?
Do you understand?

167
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,961
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

我能拿回那封信嗎?

171
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,882
如你所願。

172
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:48,539
——謝謝。-貝克先生，有時需要希望，有時需要接受。
- Thank you. - Mr. Baker, there's a time for hope and there's a time for acceptance.

173
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,717
你最不想給你女兒的就是虛假的希望。
The last thing you want to give your daughter is false hope.

174
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,937
這可能會讓她的處境非常糟糕。
That could make her situation very dire.

175
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,026
你明白嗎?
Do you understand?

176
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,593
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:27,927
你好。
Hello.

178
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,581

謝謝你昨天幫了我女兒瑪雅。
Uh, thank you for helping my daughter Maya yesterday.

180
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,283
我回來晚了一點。
I was a little bit late coming back.

181
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:41,592
你知道的，我們現在住在兩套公寓之間，而且我們的新家沒有電。
It's, uh, you know, we're between apartments, and we don't have electricity at our new place.

182
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:46,336
對不起,我……我不會說英語。
So... Sorry, I... I don't speak English.

183
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,470
哦,是的。
Oh, yes.

184
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,602
陽台上。是的。
The balcony. Yeah.

185
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,954
我的英語能力恢復了。
Um, well, my-my English came back to me.

186
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,434
很抱歉聲音太大了。
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry for the loud noise.

187
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,045
那是因為我的女朋友奈傑瑪。
It's because of my girlfriend Nedjma.

188
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,960
她對我有不好的影響。
She's a bad influence on me.

189
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,658
我,呃,小薇吉妮。
I'm, uh, Virginie.

190
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,789
我是比爾。
I'm Bill.

191
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,400
你好,比爾。
Hello, Bill.

192
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,445
你來馬賽度假?
You're in Marseille for vacation?

193
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,491
去看我女兒。
Uh, visiting my daughter.

194
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:11,666
它很酷。
It's cool.

195
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:17,802
希望我們只在這裏多待一兩天，但如果你有什麼需要，我們就在隔壁。
Well, hopefully we're only here for one or two more days, but if you need anything, you know, we're next door.

196
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,500
謝謝你,女士。
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,589
謝謝你！再見,比爾。
Thank you. Bye, Bill.

198
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:42,610

我能幫你什麼嗎?
So, how can I help you?

219
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,942
我想見Leparq夫人談談案子的事。

我們得聽聽他想說什麼。
We need to hear what he has to say.

225

貝克先生，Maître Leparq昨天跟你說得很清楚了。
Mr. Baker, Maître Leparq was very clear with you yesterday.

她不能繼續追查這個案子。
She cannot pursue this case.

227
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:07,624
但如果你想做進一步的調查，我們可以建議你這麼做。
But if you wish to pursue a further investigation, we can recommend this.

No, I don't want, I don't want a detective.

We have worked with the people on this list, and they're all very capable.

231
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:19,636
我不在乎他們有多能幹。我不希望…-我在圈名字，你可以…-別兜圈子了。
I don't care how capable they are. I don't want... - I'm circling the names that you can... - Stop circling that.

232
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,986
我女兒在監獄裏。
My daughter's in fucking jail.

233

Let you out a bit late today. They shouldn't do that.

你知道他們會準時給你打電話的。

-我幫你洗衣服了。——謝謝。
- I did your laundry. - Thanks.

246
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,691
你把我的信給勒帕克了嗎?

247
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,780
是的,當然。
Yeah, of course.

248
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,305
她怎麼說?
And what'd she say?

249
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:27,704
她跟我說了你寫的關於阿基姆和派對上那個女孩的事。-她怎麼說?
Well, uh, she told me what you wrote about Akim - and the girl at the party. - And what'd she say?

250
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:33,971
她說，你知道，她處理過很多這樣的案子……爸爸。
Well, she said, you know, she works on a lot of these cases... Dad.

251
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,061
她到底要不要調查?
Is she gonna investigate it or not?

252
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,107
告訴我。
Just tell me.

253
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,589
是的，她會調查的。
Yeah, she's gonna look into it.

254
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,243
真的嗎?
Really?

255
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,246
她說的?
She said that?

256
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,073
她說她會調查的?
She said she's gonna look into it?

257
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,988
這是正確的。
That's right.

258
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,164
我告訴她你有多強烈。
I told her how strongly you felt about it.

259
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,602
她需要我做什麼嗎?
Does she need me to do anything?

260
00:20:55,645 --> 00:21:03,262
不。她說她只是需要點時間，還有…她確實說過，她不想做任何承諾。
No. She said she just needs some time, and, uh... She did say, uh, she didn't want to make any promises.

261
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:07,831
她不想給你任何虛假的希望或類似的東西。-不不不不
She-she didn't want to give you any false hope - or nothing like that. - No, no, no, no, no.

262
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,833
但這仍然很棒。
But that's-that's still great.

263
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,835
Akim存在。
Akim exists.

264
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,402
他殺了莉娜。

265
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,795
我知道。
I know.

266
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,753
我知道。
I know that.

267
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:20,191
你不知道那封信我寫了多少遍又重寫了多少遍。
You have no idea how many times I-I wrote and then rewrote that letter.

268
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,410
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

269
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,107
嗯，它起作用了。
Well, it worked.

270
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,892
是的。
Yeah.

271
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,981
也許上帝回應了我們的祈禱。
Maybe God answered our prayers.

272
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,852
謝謝你,爸爸。
Thank you, Dad.

273
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,159
非常感謝。
Thank you so much.

274
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,350
對不起,女士。
Excuse me, ma'am.

275
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,222
比爾貝克。我打電話問名單的事。
Bill Baker. Called about a list.

276
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,181
請等一下。
One moment please.

277
00:21:53,224 --> 00:22:00,188
我不知道你對這個案子記得多少，但艾莉森來這裏上大學，她就是在那裏認識了莉娜。
I don't know how much you remember about the case, but Allison came here for college, and that's where she met this girl, Lina.

278
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:06,803
艾莉森和莉娜在一起，有天晚上他們大吵了一架，艾莉森去了一家酒吧。
Allison and Lina were... together, and one night they got in a big fight, and Allison went to a bar.

279
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,371
她就是在那裏認識了那個叫阿基姆的。
That's where she met this Akim guy.

280
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,851
他們喝了些飲料。
And they had some drinks.

281
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:17,248
他偷了她的錢包，艾莉森回家後，發現莉娜死了，就報了警。
He stole her purse, and... when Allison got home, she found Lina dead and called the police.

282
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,207
他們一直沒能找到這個阿基姆。
And they never could find this Akim.

283
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,775
是他殺了莉娜
He's the one who killed Lina.

284
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,865
你覺得呢?
What do you think?

285
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,434
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

286
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,350
你會說英語，對吧?
You speak English, right?

287
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,743
英語嗎?
English?

288
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,702
是的。我是。
Yes. I am.

289
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,052
他媽的。
Fuck.

290
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,316
把信還給我。
Give me back the letter.

291
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,074
貝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

292
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,251
請。
Please.

293
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,166
我的辦公室。
My office.

294
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:09,083
這個案子發生的時候我還在服役。
I was in service at the time of this case.

295
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,172
在警察局。
In the police.

296
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,479
你跟這個Okonedo談過了嗎?
Have you talked to this Okonedo?

297
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,046
——教授。——不,先生。
- The professor. - No, sir.

298
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,877
我知道你的律師為什麼不想幫忙了。
I see why your lawyer doesn't want to help.

299
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:24,185
某個孩子在派對上聽到了謀殺的流言。
Some kid at a party hears gossip about a murder.

300
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,405
也許她還記得這個著名的案子。
Maybe she remembers this famous case.

301
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,233
為什麼是現在?那是五年前的事了。
Why now? It was five years ago.

302
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:33,020
我兒子在監獄裏待了這麼久，五年。
That's... that's how long my kid's been in jail, five years.

303
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,458
她知道我們要見面嗎?
Does she know we are meeting?

304
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,894
你的孩子。
Your kid.

305
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,374
不,先生。
No, sir.

306
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,426
你有錢嗎，貝克先生?
Are you rich, Mr. Baker?

307
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,819
沒有,先生。
No, sir.

308
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,474
這是一個DNA案件。
This is a DNA case.

309
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,302
它意味著兩個步驟。
It means two steps.

310
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:57,218
首先，我要找那個年輕人。
First, I look for the young man.

311
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,002
這並不容易。
That will not be easy.

312
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,223
人們會說話。他會試圖消失。
People will talk. He will try to disappear.

313
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:13,321
如果我找到這個阿基姆，我就得拿到他的DNA樣本然後利用我在警局的關係把它和犯罪現場的DNA做對比。
Then, if I find this Akim, I have to get a sample of his DNA and use my connections in the police to test it against the DNA from the crime scene.

314
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,237
多少錢?
How much?

315
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,899
12000美元?
$12,000?

316
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,814
歐元。
Euros.

317
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,296
謝謝你抽出時間。
Thank you for your time.

318
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,299
貝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

319
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,172
你相信你女兒是無辜的嗎?
Do you believe your daughter is innocent?

320
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,174
我知道她是。
I know she is.

321
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:45,048
那也許看到她重獲自由就不算什麼了。
Then maybe it's not so much to see her go free.

322
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,574
-打擾一下，女士。——是嗎?
- Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes?

323
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,185
-能問你個問題嗎?-當然可以。
- Ask you a question, please? - Yes, of course.

324
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,319
我只是太蠢了，一個人搞不懂。
I'm just too much of a dumbass to figure this out on my own.

325
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,581
我不會說法語。
I don't speak French.

326
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,975
我能幫你什麼嗎?
Uh, how can I help you?

327
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:45,413
我在找一個在這裏工作的人。
I'm looking for a guy, uh, who works here.

328
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,605
——是嗎?-對不起打斷一下。
- Oui? - Sorry to interrupt.

329
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:06,434
你會說英語嗎?
Do you speak English?

330
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,482
我會。
I do.

331
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,441
找帕特裏克·奧科內多。
Looking for Patrick Okonedo.

332
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,358
請坐。
Have a seat please.

333
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,707
沒關係。我就在外面等著。
That's all right. I'll wait outside.

334
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,623
不,不,謝謝。加入派對。
No, no, please. Join the party.

335
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,640
這是令人印象深刻的,是吧?
It's impressive, huh?

336
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:44,080
這是一間有博士學位的辦公室。
It's the kind of office a PhD will get you.

337
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,952
薄荷茶。
Mint tea.

338
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:51,261
我想和你在派對上跟艾莉森說的那個女孩談談。
I want to talk to the girl you told Allison about from the party.

339
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,524
是的。我也這麼認為。
Yes. I assumed as much.

340
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,267
說實話，我一直對發生的事感到內疚。
To be honest, I've always felt guilty about what happened.

341
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,269
我應該提醒艾莉森的。
I should've warned Allison.

342
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,184
警告她?關於什麼?
Warned her? About what?

343
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:06,537
我知道艾莉森和莉娜睡在一起，但我不知道莉娜搬去和她住了。
Well, I knew Allison and Lina were sleeping together, but I had no idea Lina had moved in with her.

344
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:14,589
我盡量不去懷疑這種類型的關係。貧民區的窮女孩，有錢的美國學生…但我卻為自己的天真而感到內疚。
I try to not be cynical about these type of relationships... poor girl from the ghetto, rich American student... but then I end up being guilty of naivete.

345
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,112
艾利森出身貧寒。
Allison grew up poor.

346
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,418
她並不富有。
She isn't rich.

347
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,594
有教養的。
Educated.

348
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,466
人們對文化精英有很多不滿。
There is a lot of resentments towards the cultural elite.

349
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,251
但我相信你已經意識到了。
But I'm sure you're aware of that.

350
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,515
派對上那個女孩呢?
What about the girl from the party?

351
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:28,777
——我的學生嗎?-是的。
- My student? - Yeah.

352
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,692
她的名字叫Souad。
Her name is Souad.

353
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:35,305
她是外展項目的，莉娜和艾莉森剛認識的時候也參加了這個項目。
She's from the outreach program, the same one Lina and Allison were involved with when they met.

354
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,656
她聽到有人在說莉娜的謀殺案嗎?
And she heard some guy talking about Lina's murder?

355
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,441
這是她告訴我的。
This is what she told me.

356
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,312
我能和她說話嗎?
Could I talk to her?

357
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,010
她會跟你談的，是的。
She'll talk to you, yes.

358
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,490
我把她的電話號碼給你。
I'll give you her phone number.

359
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,669
蘇德英語說得不好。
Souad doesn't speak English very well.

360
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,322
你需要有人來翻譯。
You will need someone to translate.

361
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:55,108
你能幫我嗎?
Oh, could you do that for me?

362
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,676
不，我不願意。
No, I'd rather not.

363
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,201
我還在負責外展項目。
I'm still running the outreach program.

364
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,681
我不能和你在一起。
I cannot be associated with you.

365
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,684
或者你女兒，在發生了那些事之後。
Or your daughter, after what happened.

366
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,555
不管我個人的看法是什麼。
Whatever my personal opinion may be.

367
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,297
我的女兒是無辜的。
My daughter's innocent.

368
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,478
祝你好運。
I wish you good luck.

369
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:31,100
帕特麗夏，恐怕我又需要幫助了。
Hey, Patricia, afraid I need some help again.

370
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:35,757
我明天要參加一個很特別的生日聚會，我把地址弄丟了。
I'm supposed to attend a very special birthday tomorrow, and I lost the address.

371
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,559
你好嗎?
Bonjour?

372
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,822
嗨。比爾•貝克。
Hi. It's Bill Baker.

373
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,780
能再重複一遍嗎?
Pardon?

374
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,783
-比爾，從酒店來的——啊,比爾。
- Bill, from the hotel. - Ah, Bill.

375
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:06,788
是的，我順路過來。對不起……-最後一層。——好的。
Yeah, I was stopping by. Sorry to... - Uh, last floor. - All right.

376
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,619
嗨,比爾。
Hi, Bill.

377
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,795
嘿,瑪雅。
Hey, Maya.

378
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,579
我有東西給你。
I got something for you.

379
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,581
這是一個機器人。
It's a robot.

380
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,721
-嗨。-嗨。對不起,打擾了。

381
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,462
不,沒關係。進來吧。
No, it's okay. Come in.

382
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,552
我有幾個朋友過來。

383
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,249
哦。
Oh.

384
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:34,773
你怎麼找到我們的?
How did you find us?

385
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:41,823
前台的女士給了我你的地址，因為我要給一個女孩打電話，但她不會說英語，這是私事。
Oh, the lady at reception gave me your address 'cause there's this girl I need to call, but she don't speak English, and it's kind of personal.

386
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,825
你想讓我幫你打個電話。是這樣嗎?
Ah, you want me to make the call for you. Is that right?

387
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,261
好的，女士，不過我下次再來。
Yes, ma'am, but I'll come back another time.

388
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,133
不,它很好。剛進來。
No, it's fine. Uh, just come in.

389
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,830
讓我拿一下手機。
Just let me grab my phone.

390
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,484
來了。
Come.

391
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,793
嘿。
Hey.

392
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:59,406
比爾，這是馬賽劇院的creme de la crme。
Bill, this is, uh, the creme de la crme of the Marseille theater scene.

393
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,715
是啊。
Ouais.

394
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,632
我們在做一個，面具練習。
Uh, we're doing this, uh, mask exercise.

395
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:09,808

396
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,593
屋子很亂,請原諒。
Excuse the mess.

397
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,334
這將是我的辦公室，但我們還是要搬進去。
This is going to be my office, but we're still moving in.

398
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,205
請坐。
Have a seat.

399
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,554
我要打給誰?
So, who am I calling?

400
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:21,254
嗯…信上的那個女孩。
Um... the girl from the letter.

401
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,865
-是關於案子的嗎?——是的,女士。
- Ah, it's about the case? - Yes, ma'am.

402
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,606
我想見見她。
I want to meet with her.

403
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,869
律師沒有幫你嗎?
Is the lawyer not helping you?

404
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,872
呃，現在我自己來。
Uh, doing it myself for now.

405
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,874
哦。哇。
Oh. Wow.

406
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,354
好吧。嗯…
Okay. Um...

407
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,185
——是的。——嗯…
- Oui. - Um...

408
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,456
多划算啊，我通過我的一個朋友買下了這個地方。
What a great deal, I got this place through this friend of mine.

409
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,286
我很喜歡這裏的景色，但有一些缺點。
I fell in love with this view, but, uh, has a few defects.

410
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,810
可能只是一個斷路器。
Probably just a circuit breaker.

411
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,420
如果你想的話，我可以幫你看看。
I could look at it if you want.

412
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,945
-是的。你知道怎麼做嗎?——是的,女士。
- Yeah. You know how to do that? - Yes, ma'am.

413
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,338
那太好了。
Well, that would be great.

414
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,471
Souad?Souad?
Souad? Souad?

415
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,212
是的,你好。Souad?
Oui, bonjour. Souad?

416
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,213
你好。
Bonjour.

417
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,522
．..比爾貝克。
...Bill Baker.

418
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:16,222
比爾•貝克……哦,不。
Bill Baker... Oh, non.

419
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,705
讓我看看。讓我看看。
Let me see. Let me see.

420
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,537
-♪你好♪-酷。
- ♪ Hey ♪ - Cool.

421
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,626
♪性感的夫人……♪
♪ Sexy lady... ♪

422
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,892
我不知道它會這樣。
I didn't know it did that.

423
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:44,554
這很容易。等一等。那就這樣吧。
That-that goes on easy. Hold on. There you go.

424
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,947
看起來不錯。
Looks good.

425
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,907
非常感謝。
Merci beaucoup.

426
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,039
再見。
Au revoir.

427
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,608
好吧。她同意明天6點見你。
Okay. She agrees to see you tomorrow at 6:00.

428
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:56,566
好吧。
All right.

429
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,394
她人很好。
Um, she was nice.

430
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,266
有點害羞。
Bit shy.

431
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,268
如果你不講法語，你要怎麼跟她說話?
So how are you gonna talk to her if you don't speak French?

432
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:04,923
這個問題問得很好。
Well, that's a fair question.

433
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,968
我會想辦法的。
I'll figure it out.

434
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,578
好吧。
Okay.

435
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,580
如果你需要，我可以過來翻譯。
Well, I could come and translate if you need.

436
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,452
你確定嗎?
You sure?

437
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,584
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.

438
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:19,502
瑪雅有美術課，如果你五點半來，我們就開我的車。
Yeah, Maya has art class, so if you come here at 5:30, then we take my car.

439
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,852
謝謝。
Appreciate it.

440
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:24,507
你告訴我保險絲盒在哪裏，我幫你修理斷路器。
Uh, you show me where that fuse box is, I'll work on that breaker for you.

441
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,292
不,這是好的。
No, it's okay.

442
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,684
你沒必要這麼做。
You don't have to do that.

443
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,382
哦,不,不。
Oh, non, non.

444
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,776
把那該死的東西給我。我…來吧。
Just give me that damn thing. I... Come on.

445
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,478
比爾!
Bill!

446
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,351
再見,比爾!
Bye, Bill!

447
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,485
再見。
Bye.

448
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:59,673
我得承認，我上網看了艾莉森的案子。
I have to confess, uh, I went online and I read about Allison's case.

449
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,805
這在當時是個大新聞。
It was a big story at the time.

450
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,895
我是說，媒體很兇，不是嗎?
I mean, the-the press was ferocious, no?

451
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,942
你說「f-ferocious」?
Y-You say "f-ferocious"?

452
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,727
-是的，女士，我們是這麼說的——是嗎?
- Yes, ma'am, we say that. - Yeah?

453
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:13,382
莆田市。
Putain.

454
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,993
笨蛋。
Dumbass.

455
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:18,083
是的,…這裏的人都不知道怎麼開車。
Yeah, people... they don't know how to drive in this fucking town.

456
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,346
馬賽是個瘋狂的地方。
It's a crazy place, Marseille.

457
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,130
但比起巴黎，我還是更喜歡巴黎。
But I still prefer it to Paris.

458
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,394
你知道嗎，這裏的人會互相交談。
You know, people actually talk to each other here.

459
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,483
而且，它更便宜。
And plus, it's cheaper.

460
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,096
艾利森為什麼來這裏上學?
And why did Allison come here for school?

461
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,575
我很好奇。
I'm curious.

462
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,969
——不知道。——不是嗎?
- Don't know. - No?

463
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,015
是的，她要去俄克拉荷馬州立大學。
Yeah, she was going to Oklahoma State.

464
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:41,019
有一天她打電話給我，說"我要去法國"去這裏。
She just called me up one day, said, "I'm going to France," to here.

465
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,760
她是獨立的。
She's independent.

466
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,502
是的,女士。總是。
Yes, ma'am. Always been.

467
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:47,721
你關閉嗎?
Are you close?

468
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,637
你讀了她的信。
Well, you read her letter.

469
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,857
她媽媽在哪兒?
And where is her mother?

470
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,685
她通過了。
She passed.

471
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,035
她自殺了。
Killed herself.

472
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,605
艾莉森主要是由她奶奶養大的。
Allison was raised by her grandmother mostly.

473
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,042
我不常在你身邊。
I wasn't around much.

474
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,521
你在哪裏?
Where were you?

475
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:10,831
在石油鑽塔上工作，當我不是的時候卻一團糟。
Working oil rigs and... being a fuckup when I wasn't.

476
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,791
做一個單親媽媽並不容易。
It's not easy being a single parent.

477
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,446
我經常在晚上工作，而瑪雅，她很沮喪。
I often work at night, and Maya, she gets really upset.

478
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,709
-你是做什麼的?-我是個演員。
- What do you do? - I'm an actress.

479
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,798
-在電視上?——沒有。
- Oh, on TV? - No.

480
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,887
劇院。
Theater.

481
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,541
你去劇院嗎?
Do you go to theater?

482
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,717
不,女士。
No, ma'am.

483
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,893
——從來沒有?——不,女士。
- Never? - No, ma'am.

484
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,419
好吧。
Okay.

485
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,774
謝謝你們跟我聊天。
Uh, thank y'all for talking to me.

486
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:48,651
她在派對上認識的那個人，阿基姆關於他，她有什麼線索嗎?
So, this guy that she met at the party, Akim... uh, anything she could tell us about him?

487
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,139
她說他很安靜，人也很好。
She said he was quiet and nice.

488
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,619
好嗎?
Nice?

489
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:08,932
然後他告訴她的朋友他刺傷了一個女孩警察一直沒抓到他。
And then he told her friend he'd stabbed a girl and that the police never caught him.

490
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,760
——所以……——好的。
- So... - Okay.

491
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,458
她知道他住哪兒嗎?
Does she know where he lives?

492
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,161
她知道他住哪兒嗎?
Does she know where he lives?

493
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,645
——Kalliste。——Kalliste ?
- a Kalliste. - Kalliste?

494
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,821
她說他住在另一個項目裏。
She says he lives in a different project.

495
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,605
它叫做Kalliste。
It's called Kalliste.

496
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,141
-她在說什麼?——沒有什麼幫助。
- What's she saying? - Nothing helpful.

497
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,623
我,嗯…父親。
I-I'm, uh... le pere.

498
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,060
哦,埃裏森。
Uh, Allison.

499
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,975
那是我的小女兒。
That's my little girl.

500
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,021
艾利森是我的媽媽。
Allison is my... ma fille.

501
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,110
你明白嗎?
You understand?

502
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,902
她不想幫忙。
She doesn't want to help.

503
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:07,904
她能告訴我什麼嗎?
Can she tell me anything?

504
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,602
這傢伙長什麼樣子?
Wh-What does this guy look like?

505
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,872
-他們要去哪裏?——他們要離開。
- Where they going? - They're leaving.

506
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,787
不，不，不。等一下，等一下，等一下。
Uh, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

507
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,181
等等,不,不。等一等。只是等待。不,不。
Wait, no, no. Hold on. Just wait. No, no.

508
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,312
-好吧，好吧-哇，哇，哇!Wouah !
- All right, all right. - Wouah, wouah, wouah! Wouah!

509
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,923
Souad。嘿,Souad !Souad !
Souad. Hey, Souad! Souad!

510
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,795
比爾，比爾，讓他們走，好嗎?她的害怕。
Bill, Bill, let them go, okay? She's afraid.

511
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,231
害怕什麼?我在跟她說話。
Afraid of what? I'm talking to her.

512
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,928
是啊，但這裏不是這樣的。
Yeah, but that's not how it works here.

513
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:34,888
那你告訴我是怎麼回事，因為這裏沒人幫我。
Well, you tell me how it works then, 'cause nobody here's doing shit for me.

514
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,977
我什麼都為你做，好嗎?
I do shit for you, okay?

515
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,154
我們應該去。現在。
We should go. Now.

516
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200
好吧?
Okay?

517
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,854
-好吧——好吧?
- Yeah, all right. - All right?

518
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,083
就是這樣。Kalliste。
That's it. Kalliste.

519
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,085
她說阿基姆住在那裏。
That's where she says Akim lives.

520
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,913
我們可以四處看看嗎?
Well, can we go look around?

521
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,610
不。現在不行。
No. Not at this time.

522
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,222
對我們來說不安全。
It's not safe for us.

523
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,832
因為我們是白色?
'Cause we're white?

524
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,010
因為我們不是那裏的人。
'Cause we're not from there.

525
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:12,230
有很多交易。
And there's a lot of dealing.

526
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,057
我得做點什麼。
Well, I got to do something.

527
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,234
沒人會跟你說話的，相信我。
No one will talk to you, trust me.

528
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:20,890
比爾，如果沒有阿基姆呢?
Bill, what if there's no Akim?

529
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,892
有。
There is.

530
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:26,766
好吧，但他們在調查過程中沒找到這個人。
Okay, but they never found this person during the investigation.

531
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,289
我女兒不是騙子。
My daughter's not a liar.

532
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,899
不，我沒說她是。
No, I didn't say she was.

533
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:33,599
只是我讀到的所有關於這個案子的資料…你現在算是專家了嗎?
It's just that everything I read about the case... So you're some kind of expert now?

534
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,037
不,我不是。
No, I'm not.

535
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,609
新聞界反對我們。
The press was against us.

536
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:49,136
他們只關心艾莉森和某個阿拉伯女孩上床。
All they cared about was Allison was sleeping with some Arab girl.

537
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,662
一群假新聞的人渣。
Bunch of... fake news scumbags.

538
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,187
所以你才打了那個英國記者?
That's why you punched that English reporter?

539
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:02,062
我當時正在喝酒。
I was drinking then.

540
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,117
你告訴奶奶萊帕克的事了嗎?
Hey, did you tell Gram about Leparq?

541
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,989
不。
No.

542
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,297
不，我不想在我們瞭解更多之前讓她抱太大希望。
No, I didn't want to get her hopes up until we know more.

543
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,299
你奶奶，她上年紀了。
She's getting on, your grandmother.

544
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,303
我昨天和法官見了面。
Oh, I had a meeting with the judge yesterday.

545
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,306
噢,是嗎?關於什麼?
Oh, yeah? About what?

546
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,874
我三個月後就要假釋審查了。
Well, I have my parole review coming up in about three months.

547
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:35,051
這就是我一個月有一天能離開這裏的原因。
And, uh, it's the thing where I get out of here one day a month.

548
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,444
是的,好的。
Yeah, okay.

549
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,099
-他怎麼說?——她。她說。
- So what'd he say? - She. She said.

550
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:44,452
你知道，只要我表現良好，就不會有問題。
Uh, you know, as long as my behavior remained good, shouldn't be a problem.

551
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,760
我想說，去他的假釋。
I felt like saying, "Fuck parole.

552
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,805
我的律師正在想辦法讓我永遠離開這裏"
My lawyer's working on getting me out of here for good."

553
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,416
不，我們還不知道，艾麗。
No, we don't know that yet, Ally.

554
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,809
-你得繼續…-我知道，我知道，爸爸。
- You got to keep... - I know, I know, I know, Dad.

555
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,986
我沒那麼說。但我想這麼做。
I-I didn't say that. But I wanted to.

556
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,033
Leparq辦公室的人也在那裏。
And... somebody from Leparq's office was there.

557
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,470
噢,是嗎?
Oh, yeah?

558
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:07,301
是的。我沒見過她，但我問她調查進展如何。
Yeah. I never met her, but I asked her how the investigation was going.

559
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,825
她跟你說什麼了?
What'd she tell you?

560
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:14,047
她說她什麼都不知道，但她還說她剛開始在那裏工作。
She said she didn't know anything about it, but she also said she just started working there.

561
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,876
勒帕克可能會自己處理。
Leparq's probably taking care of it herself.

562
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,356
這是個大案子。
It's a big case.

563
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,835
是的。
Yeah.

564
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,837
我告訴她我想和萊帕克談談。
I told her I wanted to talk to Leparq.

565
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,361
她應該隨時通知我們。
She should be keeping us informed.

566
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,319
-你懂我的意思嗎?-我會跟她說的
- You know what I mean? - I'll talk to her.

567
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:32,718
好吧。嗯…過幾天見。
Okay. Well... I'll see you in a couple days.

568
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:36,199
爸，你能不能在馬賽多待一會兒?
Uh, Dad, do you think that you could stay in Marseille a little longer?

569
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,940
以防萬一。
Just in case something comes up.

570
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,160
是的，我可以。
Yeah, I could do that.

571
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:43,206
我去檢查一下工作情況。
I'll check in on work and stuff.

572
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,819
如果你需要的話，我可以讓奶奶給你電匯錢。
I-I can have Gram wire you some money if you need.

573
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,777
不，不，別這樣。我會想辦法的。
No, no, don't do that. I-I'll figure it out.

574
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,257
謝謝,爸爸。
Thanks, Dad.

575
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,912
再見。
Bye.

576
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:08,231
嗯,馬克斯。
Uh, Max.

577
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,842
你好。
Salut.

578
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,906
——協議。——嗯。
- D'accord. - Ay.

579
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:20,347
現在，一旦石油公司有了租約…給我，M。
Now, once the oil company has a lease... Give it here, M.

580
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,479
來吧。
Come on.

581
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:27,180
一旦石油公司拿到租約，他們就會僱傭一家鑽井公司。
Once that oil company has that lease, they hire a drilling company.

582
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:28,964
我就是為他工作的
That's who I work for.

583
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:32,402
然後我們到了那裏，把所有的東西組裝起來。
And then we get there, we rig up and we put all that shit together.

584
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:37,190
一旦裝備好了，我們就開始挖洞。
Once we have that rig up, we start making hole.

585
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,974
這就是鑽工的工作。
That's what a roughneck does.

586
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,106
我們打洞。
We make hole.

587
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,500
好吧，測試一下。
All right, test it.

588
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,328
繼續沖吧
Go on, flush it.

589
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,026
得到它。
Get it.

590
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,244
——沖洗。——啊,沖洗。
- Flush. - Ah, flush.

591
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,420
-是的。——是吧。
- Yeah. - D'accord.

592
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,248
沖洗。
Flush.

593
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,555
- Ca va ?-當然了，ça va!
- Ça va? - Hell yeah, ça va!

594
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,344
比爾,來了。
Bill, come.

595
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,520
到這裏來。
Come here.

596
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,913
過來看看這個。
Come and see this.

597
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,567
Nedjma是一個技術天才。
Nedjma is a technical genius.

598
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,569
我不是天才。我只是年輕。
I'm not a genius. I'm just younger.

599
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,443
-好吧…-這些是網上的嗎?
- Okay... - These are online or some shit?

600
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:17,491
這些都是Souad和她那個賤朋友的Instagram賬號。
These are all from Instagram accounts of Souad and her bitchy friend.

601
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,102
這些照片都是派對上拍的。
And these photos are all from the party.

602
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,408
你們怎麼拿到的?
How'd y'all get them?

603
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:29,895
我註冊了一個虛假的Instagram賬號，跟蹤了蘇德和她可愛的朋友薩米拉，然後定位了蘇德看到這傢伙時參加的派對。
I set up a false Instagram account, followed Souad and her lovely friend whose name is Samira, and then geotagged the party Souad was at when she saw this guy.

604
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:33,246
所以阿基姆有可能在其中一張照片裏。
So there's a chance Akim is in one of these photos.

605
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,253
．..阿拉伯人，皮膚白皙。
...Arab and light skin.

606
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,037
是啊，膚色淺，個子高。
Yeah, uh, light skin, yeah, and tall.

607
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:52,047
我們要把它們打印出來，然後你可以拿給艾莉森看。
So we're going to print them up, and then you can show them to Allison.

608
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,355
-不，我不會那麼做的。——為什麼?
- No, I'm not gonna do that. - Why?

609
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,400
如果阿基姆在那裏，她會知道的。
If Akim is there, she'll know.

610
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,141
我也不在乎
I don't care.

611
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,274
我不會那麼做的。我不會這麼對她的。
I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna do it to her.

612
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,928
我得保護她。
I got to protect her.

613
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,407
我不明白你的意思。
I don't understand.

614
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,410
你為什麼對艾莉森這麼固執?
Wh-why you're being so stubborn about Allison?

615
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,936
我們現在要做的是回到蘇阿德我們拿到了那些照片。
What we should do is go back to Souad now we got those pictures.

616
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:15,505
我們從Instagram上偷了這些照片，所以我不確定這是不是個好主意。
Well, we stole these photos from Instagram, so I'm not sure this is a good idea.

617
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,335
——嗯…-我能說句話嗎?
- Well... - Can I say something?

618
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:20,989
是啊,說吧。
Ouais, vas-y.

619
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:25,254
馬賽有其他人見過阿基姆還是只有艾莉森?
Did anyone else in Marseille see this Akim guy or just Allison?

620
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,039
酒吧老闆。
Bar owner.

621
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,257
他們相遇的地方。
Where they met.

622
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:29,737
他在審判現場。
He was at the trial.

623
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,565
-他什麼都沒做，但是…——好的。
- He didn't do shit, but... - Okay.

624
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,089
那個酒吧叫什麼來著?的叫什麼名字?
Uh, what's it called, the bar? What's the name?

625
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,961
我不記得名字了。
I don't remember the name of it.

626
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:38,616
-就在她公寓附近-是的。好吧。
- It was near her apartment. - Yeah. Okay.

627
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:39,704
-嗯-嗯
- Mm. - Mm.

628
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,332
好吧。
Okay.

629
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,508
比爾，你投票給特朗普了嗎?
Bill, did you vote for Trump?

630
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,989
不。
No.

631
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,469
啊。瞧。
Ah. Voila.

632
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,733
-我沒有投票。——什麼?
- I didn't vote. - What?

633
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,605
-你為什麼不投票?-有案底。
- Why didn't you vote? - Got a record.

634
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,129
我被逮捕。
I was arrested.

635
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,218
這種情況下他們不讓你投票。
They don't let you vote when that happens.

636
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,586
就在那兒，就在那個角落。
It's there, around that corner.

637
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:44,682
你的朋友，奈傑瑪…她因為你幫了我而生氣嗎?
Your friend, uh, Nedjma... she mad at you for helping me?

638
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,772
不要擔心Nedjma;她通常懷有敵意。
Don't worry about Nedjma; she's generally hostile.

639
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:51,689
她對我保護欲很強，但她是我的好朋友。
You know, she's very protective with me, but she's a good friend.

640
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,169
她幫我照顧瑪雅。
She helps me with Maya.

641
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,781
瑪雅的父親在哪兒?
Where's Maya's father?

642
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:00,088
科西嘉島，在海灘上開夜總會。

643
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,612
他是個放蕩的人。
He was a... a fling.

644
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,527
-你是這麼說的?——扔,是的。
- That's how you say? - Fling, yeah.

645
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,225
是的。
Yeah.

646
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,748
他訪問嗎?
Does he visit?

647
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:10,055
他以前喜歡，但他不喜歡的時候更好。
He used to, but it's better when he doesn't.

648
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,189
什麼?
What?

649
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,192
那是艾莉森住的地方。
That's where Allison lived.

650
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:20,805
21歲。
Twenty-one.

651
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,765
就是在那裏發生的嗎?
That's where it happened?

652
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,375
是的。
Yeah.

653
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,602
-你好。-你好。
- Bonjour. - Bonjour.

654
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:49,790
他是新老闆。
He's the new owner.

655
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,401
案發時他不在現場。
He wasn't there when the crime happened.

656
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,447
他知道我們在哪能找到原來的主人嗎?
Does he know where we could find the old owner?

657
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,579
是的,我知道。
Yes, I know.

658
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:57,755

喝我的利潤。

660
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,382

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,303
他承認任何人嗎?
He recognize anybody?

662
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:41,799
他說了什麼?
What's he saying?

663
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,296
莆田市。
Putain.

664
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,646
好吧。生活就是好。我們走吧。
Okay. Ç'est bon. Let's go.

665
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,778
他說什麼?
What'd he say?

666
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,345
什麼都沒有。他是無用的。
Nothing. He's useless.

667
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,915
嘿。
Hey.

00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:16,311
嘿!
Hey!

669

嘿!發生了什麼事?

670
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,881
我很抱歉。我只是…我不能再和那傢伙說話了。
I'm sorry. I just, uh... I can't talk to that guy anymore.

671
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,275
他只是說了一些可怕的事情。
He was just saying some horrible things.

672
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:24,885
像什麼?
Like what?

673
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,931
就好像他只是想把一個阿拉伯小孩送進監獄?
Like he just wants to put an Arab kid in jail, you know?

674
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,758
他不在乎哪一個。
He doesn't care which one.

675
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,804
就這些嗎?
That's it?

676
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,502
就這些嗎?你說"就這樣"是什麼意思?
That's it? What do you mean, "That's it"?

677
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:34,677
他是一個種族主義者。
He's a racist.

678
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,375
好吧，他是個種族主義者。
Okay, he's a racist.

679
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:37,680
我們還是得和他談談。
We still got to talk to him.

680
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,682
不。我不跟他說話，不
No. I don't talk to him, no.

681

他可能知道些什麼。
Well, he might know something.

682
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,208
不，他什麼都不知道!
No, he doesn't know something!

683
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,471
比爾，我們不能把一個無辜的孩子送進監獄。
Bill, we're not gonna send an innocent boy to jail.

684
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:47,386
我女兒是無辜的。
My daughter is innocent.

685
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:50,215
什麼?哦,莆田市。真不敢相信這段對話。
Quoi? Oh, putain. Can't believe this conversation.

686
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:55,394
那你就活在幻想的世界裏了，親愛的，因為我總是和那種人一起工作。
Well, then y-you live in some fancy-ass world, honey, 'cause I work with guys like that all the time.

00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:57,352
不，但沒關係，好嗎?它是不正確的。
No, but it doesn't matter, okay? It's not right.

688
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:59,877
我不是說這是…我想把我的女兒從監獄裏救出來。
I'm not saying it's ri... I'm trying to get my little girl out of jail.

689
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,356
我他媽只在乎這個。
That's all I give a fuck about.

690
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,011
你現在聽起來很像美國人。
And you sound very American right now.

691
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,231
好。我是。
Good. I am.

692
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:07,623
是啊，你也是個陌生人。
Yeah, and you're also a stranger here.

693
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,234
你什麼都不懂。你知道嗎?
You don't understand shit. You know what?

694
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:36,609
貝克先生，請稍等。

She said you need more money because Leparq reopened the case?

697

我正在處理，莎倫。
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

698
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:46,836
-處理什麼?——什麼都沒有。
- Dealing with what? - Nothing.

699
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,491
艾莉森讓我給她一封信。
I mean, Allison told me to give her a letter.

700
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:52,016
是的，現在勒帕克正在調查。
I did, and now Leparq's looking into it.

701
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:54,583
她又在找阿基姆了嗎?
Well, i-is she looking for Akim again?

702
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:57,282
我——我……我說了我會處理的，莎倫。
I'm-I'm... I told you I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

703
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,024
-誰來買單?-沒人在談錢。
- Who is gonna pay for this? - Nobody's talking about money.

704
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,373
好吧?
Okay?

705
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,375
比爾，你喝酒了嗎?
Bill, have you been drinking?

706
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:04,724
不。
No.

707
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,030
聽著，莎倫，我是她父親。
Listen, Sharon, I'm her father.

708
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,857
天啊，比爾。
Oh, my God, Bill.

709
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:09,772
你應該來拜訪然後回家。
You're supposed to visit and come home.

710
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:11,339
別搞砸了。

711
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,950
這事你得相信我。

00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,909
我要打電話給Leparq。
I'm gonna call Leparq.

714
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,563
不，別這樣，莎倫。
No, don't do that, Sharon.

715
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:18,781
沙龍!

716
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,753
爸爸，怎麼了?
Dad, what is going on?

717

我跟奶奶談過了，她說你表現得很奇怪。
I talked to Gram, she said that you're acting really weird.

718

舞台上寫什麼?

921
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,596
是的，女士，我有。
Yes, ma'am, I do.

922

法官需要一個監護人，一個願意為她擔保的人。
The judge requires a chaperone, someone who is going to vouch for her.

923
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,649

人們應該能夠攜帶槍支。

今晚就到此為止吧，各位。

-我有事要問你。——什麼?
- I need to ask you something. - What?

1251
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:31,067
你真的有槍嗎?
Do you really own a gun?

1252
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,549
哦。
Oh.

1253
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:36,986
兩槍。

——嘿,瑪雅。——嗯?

1255
01:33:13,239 --> 01:33:15,285
把我的頭盔遞給我?
Want to hand me my casque?

1256
01:33:16,503 --> 01:33:18,593
我的盔。我的頭盔。我的安全帽。
My casque. My helmet. My hard hat.

1257
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:20,507
——哦。-你能幫我拿過來嗎?
- Oh. - Will you get it for me?

1258
01:33:31,214 --> 01:33:33,085
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

1259
01:33:33,129 --> 01:33:35,653
是啊!
Ouais!

1260
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:06,684
我們開始吧。
Here we go.

1261
01:34:06,728 --> 01:34:07,990
哇!
Whoa!

1262
01:34:22,569 --> 01:34:23,527
哦。
Oh.

1263
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,008
哇。

1264
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,687
該死，這地方越來越熱了。
Damn, the place is heating up.

1265
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:55,124
——什麼?-很多粉絲。
- Quoi? - A lot of fans.

1266
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:56,560
堅果。
Going nuts.

1267
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:00,738
應該有人告訴他們，他們贏了。
Someone should tell them they're winning.

1268
01:35:51,267 --> 01:35:53,748
好了，我們走吧。
All right, let's go.

1269
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,782
原諒,原諒,原諒。
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

1270
01:36:53,372 --> 01:36:54,591
比爾。
Bill.

1271
01:36:56,723 --> 01:36:59,204
我好像看到一個工作上的朋友。
Oh, I think I see a friend from work.

1272
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:00,510
想看看是不是他。
Want to see if it's him.

1273
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,852
好了，我們去開貨車。
Okay, let's go get the van.

1274
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:40,419
-是你朋友嗎?-不，那不是他
- Is it your friend? - No, that wasn't him.

1275
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,510
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hey. - Hey.

1276
01:37:44,554 --> 01:37:46,599
-最近怎麼樣?——呃,好的。比賽剛剛結束。
- How's it going? - Uh, good. Game just ended.

1277
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:48,210
很快回家。
Be home soon.

1278
01:37:48,253 --> 01:37:49,776
-好吧，慢慢來。——這是媽媽嗎?
- Okay, take your time. - Ç'est maman?

1279
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,691
-今晚屬於你——好的。
- It's your night. - Okay.

1280
01:37:51,735 --> 01:37:53,780
呃，一會兒見。
Uh, see you in a bit.

1281
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,291
Wouah !
Wouah!

1282
01:39:25,437 --> 01:39:26,786
回去睡覺吧。
Go back to sleep.

1283
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,963
繼續。
Go on.

1284
01:39:29,006 --> 01:39:30,660
我們要回家了。
We're going home.

1285
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:49,722
Ca。
Ça va.

1286
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,031
貝克先生。
Mr. Baker.

1287
01:39:54,075 --> 01:39:55,902
很高興再次見到你。
Nice to see you again.

1288
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:56,991
你遲到了。
You're late.

1289
01:39:57,034 --> 01:39:58,949
哦。
Oh.

1290
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,342
Excusez-moi。
Excusez-moi.

1291
01:40:02,866 --> 01:40:04,694
我能為你做什麼，貝克先生?
What can I do for you, Mr. Baker?

1292
01:40:06,522 --> 01:40:08,828
我們說過的那個DNA測試我想盡快完成。
That DNA test we talked about... I want to get it done.

1293
01:40:08,872 --> 01:40:12,354
首先，我需要DNA樣本。
First I will need, uh, the DNA sample.

1294
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:27,891
我能問問你是怎麼弄到這個的嗎?
Can I ask you how you got this?

1295
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:29,893
你到底能不能做到?
Can you do it or not?

1296
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:32,722
是的,我能。
Yes, I can.

1297
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:42,601
但我以前是警察，所以我告訴你，為了證明你女兒的清白而犯罪將是一個嚴重的錯誤。
But I am an ex-cop, so let me tell you, it will be a serious mistake to commit a crime to prove your daughter innocent.

1298
01:40:42,645 --> 01:40:44,864
這也救不了她。
It will not get her out of jail.

1299
01:40:44,908 --> 01:40:46,475
它會把你送進去。
And it will send you in.

1300
01:40:46,518 --> 01:40:48,868
-你明白嗎?-你能多快?
- Do you understand? - How fast can you do it?

1301
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,655
這很難說。
It's hard to say.

1302
01:40:52,698 --> 01:40:56,093
至少一個星期，但要花你不少錢。
A week at least, but it will cost you.

1303
01:40:56,137 --> 01:40:57,877
這是3000年了。
Here's 3,000 now.

1304
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:01,403
你完成後我會再給你三千塊，但肯定比一周快。
I'll give you another 3,000 when you get it done, but it's got to be quicker than a week.

1305
01:41:01,446 --> 01:41:04,058
就算匹配，我也得找到這個人。
Even if it matches, I still have to find this guy.

1306
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:05,755
不,你沒有。
No, you don't.

1307
01:41:05,798 --> 01:41:07,539
你知道他在哪嗎?
You know where he is?

1308
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:13,980
他還是有可能在結果出來之前消失。
He could still disappear before the results come back.

1309
01:41:14,024 --> 01:41:16,809
他不會。搞定後給我打電話。
He won't. Call me when you get it done.

1310
01:41:31,215 --> 01:41:32,912
來吧。
Come on.

1311
01:41:37,874 --> 01:41:39,441
瑪雅?
Maya?

1312
01:41:42,618 --> 01:41:44,010
瑪雅?
Maya?

1313
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,582
嘿,瑪雅?
Hey, Maya?

1314
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:56,066
嘿。
Hey.

1315
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,633
嘿。
Hey.

1316
01:41:57,676 --> 01:41:59,069
-這真是一種問候。-你看到瑪雅了嗎?
- This is quite a greeting. - You seen Maya?

1317
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,505
-我在洗澡。-是的。
- I was in the shower. - Yeah.

1318
01:42:00,549 --> 01:42:02,116
她正在院子裏踢足球。
She's playing soccer in the courtyard.

1319
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,944
對不起，我遲到了。
I'm sorry I'm late.

1320
01:42:04,988 --> 01:42:09,514
-哦，沒關係。——……你不想問我第一天上班的情況嗎?
- Oh, that's all right. - It... Don't you want to ask me about my first day at work?

1321
01:42:09,558 --> 01:42:11,125
嗯,是的,是的。怎麼去了?
Uh, yeah, yeah. How'd it go?

1322
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:31,188
——比爾?——嗯?
- Bill? - Hmm?

1323
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:33,495
山洞裏的那個人是誰?
Who is the man in the cave?

1324
01:42:36,628 --> 01:42:37,847
在山洞裏嗎?
In the cave?

1325
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:40,719
用的工具。
With the tools.

1326
01:42:40,763 --> 01:42:42,808
我看見他。
I saw him.

1327
01:42:48,684 --> 01:42:51,730
我需要你的幫助。
Um, I'm gonna need your help.

1328
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:53,819
好吧?
Okay?

1329
01:42:53,863 --> 01:42:56,822
因為這是個秘密。
'Cause it's a secret.

1330
01:42:56,866 --> 01:42:59,564
你不能告訴任何人。
You can't tell anyone.

1331
01:42:59,608 --> 01:43:01,000
甚至你的媽媽。
Even your mom.

1332
01:43:01,044 --> 01:43:02,611
好吧?
Okay?

1333
01:43:04,265 --> 01:43:06,180
他是個壞人。
He's a bad man.

1334
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:08,747
他馬上就走了。
He'll be gone soon.

1335
01:43:09,879 --> 01:43:11,837
這是我們之間的秘密。
It's gonna be our secret.

1336
01:43:11,881 --> 01:43:13,578
好吧?
Okay?

1337
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:19,541
這是我的女孩。
That's my girl.

1338
01:45:20,836 --> 01:45:22,185
大便。
Shit.

1339
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:55,349
事實上，我學到了一些新東西。
I learned something new actually.

1340
01:45:56,393 --> 01:45:58,830
這對我幫助很大。
It's helped me a lot.

1341
01:45:58,874 --> 01:46:01,442
這東西叫"浴缸"
It's something called the "Mektub."

1342
01:46:01,485 --> 01:46:04,488
一個護士告訴我的。
A nurse told me about it.

1343
01:46:04,532 --> 01:46:06,011
它是關於接受。
It's about acceptance.

1344
01:46:06,055 --> 01:46:08,362
接受什麼?
Acceptance of what?

1345
01:46:09,406 --> 01:46:10,973
你的命運。
Your fate.

1346
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:15,107
它幫我停止掙扎。
It's helping me to stop struggling so much.

1347
01:46:15,151 --> 01:46:17,414
停止質疑一切。
Stop questioning everything.

1348
01:46:19,111 --> 01:46:24,378
你只要擁抱你的命運，學會平靜地生活。
You just embrace your fate and learn to live in peace with it.

1349
01:46:26,075 --> 01:46:28,425
這是穆斯林的想法。
It's a Muslim idea.

1350
01:46:28,469 --> 01:46:48,184
它是關於放棄所有的羞愧和內疚，這些讓你沮喪，讓你感到無助。
It's about... letting go of all of that...shame...and guilt that pushes you down and keeps you down and makes you feel so powerless.

1351
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:51,970
在很長一段時間裏，我都是這種感覺。
And that's how I felt for a really long time.

1352
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:57,106
無能為力和遺忘。
Powerless and forgotten.

1353
01:46:59,325 --> 01:47:04,243
這讓生活變得非常艱難。
And... that makes living really hard.

1354
01:47:05,244 --> 01:47:07,290
你懂我的意思嗎?
You know what I mean?

1355
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:13,122
但是你是無辜的。
But you're innocent.

1356
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,865
所以我們要繼續戰鬥。
So we got to keep fighting.

1357
01:47:16,908 --> 01:47:19,955
我是無辜的並不重要，爸爸。
It doesn't matter that I'm innocent, Dad.

1358
01:47:21,217 --> 01:47:23,262
這與正義無關。
It's not about justice.

1359
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:28,050
這是關於尋找平靜。
It's about finding peace.

1360
01:48:06,088 --> 01:48:09,918
我不知道你在說什麼，但你是在白費口舌。
I don't know what you're saying, but you're wasting your breath.

1361
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:14,531
等DNA出來了，我們就知道了。
We're gonna wait for that DNA, and then we'll know.

1362
01:48:14,575 --> 01:48:17,926
她問我。她付給我。
She ask me. She pay me.

1363
01:48:17,969 --> 01:48:19,362
你還要水嗎?
You want more water?

1364
01:48:19,405 --> 01:48:22,496
艾莉森，她說，去吧。你把莉娜弄暈了。」
Allison, she say, "Go. You put Lina out."

1365
01:48:22,539 --> 01:48:23,497
-夠了，現在。-「給你錢。」
- That's enough, now. - "Money for you."

1366
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:25,368
這就夠了,現在。
That's enough, now.

1367
01:48:25,411 --> 01:48:27,588
她讓我拿著。
She tell me take it.

1368
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:29,154
她給了我科利爾。
She gave me collier.

1369
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:30,286
「你把它。
"You take it.

1370
01:48:30,329 --> 01:48:31,983
——錢。」——在這裏。
- Money after." - Here.

1371
01:48:32,027 --> 01:48:33,507
喝。
Drink that.

1372
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:34,899
繼續。
Go on.

1373
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:38,250
聯合國科利爾。「你自己拿去吧。」
Un collier. "You take it for you."

1374
01:48:38,294 --> 01:48:40,426
科利爾。黃金。
Collier. Gold.

1375
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,212
像這樣。像這樣。
Like this. Like this.

1376
01:48:43,255 --> 01:48:45,519
這條項鏈嗎?我不想那樣。
The necklace? I-I don't want that.

1377
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:47,477
不!
No!

1378
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:48,870
她給了我。

01:48:48,913 --> 01:48:51,350
她說,「走吧。你把莉娜弄暈了。

1380
01:48:51,394 --> 01:48:54,310
現在的項鏈。錢後。」

1381
01:48:54,353 --> 01:48:56,007
你根本說不通。
You're not even making sense.

1382
01:48:56,051 --> 01:48:57,574
是時候閉嘴了。
Time to shut the fuck up.

1383
01:48:57,618 --> 01:48:59,489
S-Stillwater !

1384
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:04,973
你想說什麼?
What'd you say?

1385
01:49:05,016 --> 01:49:07,105

黃金。

01:49:11,936 --> 01:49:18,290
她說……「這樣做。讓她走了。
She say... "Do it. Make her go.

1389
01:49:18,334 --> 01:49:20,292
讓她出去。」

1391
01:49:40,661 --> 01:49:42,140
-嗨。-你去哪兒了?

我從波梅特家走回來的。

1393

如果我們現在不走，就會遲到。

我告訴她你要來。

我不知道你在說什麼。
I don't know what you're talking about.

1407
01:50:51,688 --> 01:50:54,386
她離開那天我送她的金項鏈。

她還戴著嗎?
Did she still have it on?

1412
01:51:02,394 --> 01:51:04,135
你在搞什麼，比爾?

我們去拿她的東西的時候，你看到了嗎?

我不記得了。為什麼?

1494
02:01:47,212 --> 02:01:48,866
足球比賽。
The soccer game.

02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:52,000
瑪雅?
With Maya?

1496
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:01,314
你讓她撒謊了嗎?
Did you ask her to lie?

1497
02:02:02,967 --> 02:02:04,665
是嗎?
Did you?

1498
02:02:05,796 --> 02:02:08,321
我從沒想過把你和瑪雅牽扯進來。

1499
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:14,022

你現在得走了。

好吧。你收拾東西走人。

1502
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,352
我可以進來嗎?

1503
02:02:45,227 --> 02:02:46,794
瑪雅?
Maya?

1504
02:02:52,234 --> 02:02:54,236
你不想跟我說話嗎?
You don't want to talk to me?

1505
02:02:55,542 --> 02:02:57,326
好吧。

02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:49,509

1510
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,772

1511
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:49,960
貝克先生，我帶來了一個特別的消息。
Mr. Baker, I've come with some extraordinary news.

1512
02:04:50,004 --> 02:04:52,354
你女兒案子的法官今早給我打電話了。
The judge in your daughter's case called me this morning.

1513
02:04:52,397 --> 02:04:54,095
新的證據已經浮出水面。
New evidence has surfaced.

1514
02:04:54,138 --> 02:04:59,317
顯然，一個退休警察找到了與未知樣本匹配的DNA。
Apparently, a retired cop came up with a DNA match on the unknown sample.

1515
02:04:59,361 --> 02:05:06,194
它也與四年前警方在一樁入室盜竊案中收集的樣本相符。
It also matched a sample the police collected on a burglary case four years ago, after the trial.

1516
02:05:06,237 --> 02:05:07,543
他們抓到他了嗎?
Did they catch him?

1517
02:05:07,587 --> 02:05:10,024
不,還沒有。
No, not yet.

1518
02:05:10,067 --> 02:05:13,462
但我們需要證明的只是足夠的懷疑。
But all we need to prove is sufficient doubt.

1519
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:18,336
所以即使他們找不到嫌疑人，他們也很有可能會釋放艾莉森。
So even if they can't find the suspect, there's a real chance they will release Allison.

1520
02:05:19,337 --> 02:05:26,214
事實上，法官已經同意重新調查，這幾乎是聞所未聞的。
In fact, the judge has already agreed to reopen the investigation, which is almost unheard of.

1521
02:05:27,258 --> 02:05:29,565
我認為這只會發生在馬賽。
I think this could only happen in Marseille.

1522
02:05:36,703 --> 02:05:39,227
謝謝你來告訴我，夫人。
Thank you for coming to tell me, ma'am.

1523
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:44,537
貝克先生，這對你的家庭來說可能是最好的結果。
Mr. Baker, this is the best possible outcome for your family.

1524
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:46,060
你明白嗎?
Do you understand?

1525
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:48,018
我做的事。
I do.

1526
02:05:49,063 --> 02:05:50,543
謝謝你,女士。
Thank you, ma'am.

1527
02:06:16,090 --> 02:06:17,613
去,會!
Go, Pokes!

1528
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:27,188
我告訴過你我們會把女兒帶回家的，我們確實這麼做了。
I told you we were gonna bring our girl home, and that's exactly what we did.

1529
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:33,455
歡迎回家,埃裏森。
Welcome home, Allison.

1530
02:06:34,717 --> 02:06:36,371
歡迎回到俄克拉荷馬州。
Welcome back to Oklahoma.

1531
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:39,417
歡迎回到美國!
Welcome back to America!

1532
02:07:29,424 --> 02:07:31,165
你是反社會?
You're being antisocial?

1533
02:07:36,605 --> 02:07:38,215
你對吧?
You all right?

1534
02:07:44,744 --> 02:08:00,629
你去馬賽那天，莎倫和我開車送你去機場，到了機場後，我覺得很尷尬，因為我沒有禮物，所以我去了禮品店。
The day you left for Marseille, Sharon and I drove you to the airport, and... when we got there, I was embarrassed I didn't have a present or nothing, so I went to the gift shop.

1535
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:05,286
我想給你買本書或者鑰匙鏈什麼的。
I thought I'd get you a book or a key chain or something.

1536
02:08:06,374 --> 02:08:08,419
然後我看到了這條項鏈。
Then I saw this necklace.

1537
02:08:10,334 --> 02:08:14,208
我以為你會把它當成一個小小的家。
I thought it'd be like a little piece of home to take with you.

1538
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,646
這是黃金。
It was gold.

1539
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:19,561
上面寫著"靜水"
Said "Stillwater" on it.

1540
02:08:33,662 --> 02:08:36,578
我不希望發生這種事。
I didn't want it to happen.

1541
02:08:40,277 --> 02:08:44,760
他說他會幫我把她弄出公寓，僅此而已。
He told me that he would just help me get her out of the apartment, that's all.

1542
02:08:46,588 --> 02:08:49,156
我不想讓她死。
I didn't want her to die.

1543
02:08:50,766 --> 02:08:52,725
我愛她。
I loved her.

1544
02:08:54,248 --> 02:08:56,380
我知道。
I know you did.

1545
02:08:58,252 --> 02:09:00,254
你覺得我是個怪物?
You think I'm a monster?

1546
02:09:01,646 --> 02:09:02,778
你是我的女兒。
You're my daughter.

1547
02:09:02,822 --> 02:09:05,781
我…我從來沒有那樣想過。
I... I could never think that.

1548
02:09:08,697 --> 02:09:11,178
爸爸，我們怎麼了?
Dad, what is wrong with us?

1549
02:09:14,442 --> 02:09:17,140
我不知道，寶貝。
I don't know, baby girl.

1550
02:09:17,184 --> 02:09:19,142
我不知道。
I don't know.

1551
02:09:19,186 --> 02:09:21,492
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1552
02:09:21,536 --> 02:09:23,103
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1553
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:27,150
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1554
02:09:31,328 --> 02:09:32,852
我也是。
Me, too.

1555
02:10:17,897 --> 02:10:21,204
♬把我頭髮上的緞帶拿開♬
♪ Take the ribbon from my hair ♪

1556
02:10:23,772 --> 02:10:28,342
♪鬆開它，讓它掉下來♪
♪ Shake it loose and let it fall ♪

1557
02:10:30,344 --> 02:10:33,869
♬把它輕輕地放在你的皮膚上

1558
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:39,875
♪就像牆上的影子……♪
♪ Like the shadows on the wall... ♪

1559
02:10:46,926 --> 02:10:48,753
早....
Morning.

1560
02:10:48,797 --> 02:10:50,364
嘿。
Hey.

1561
02:10:53,019 --> 02:10:55,586
睡不著。
Couldn't sleep.

1562
02:10:56,761 --> 02:11:01,592
去散步，最後來到了這裏。
Went for a walk, and... ended up here.

1563
02:11:04,291 --> 02:11:05,858
我很高興你這麼做了。
I'm glad you did.

1564
02:11:11,602 --> 02:11:13,343
你想念他們嗎?
You miss them?

1565
02:11:17,434 --> 02:11:18,958
我做的事。
I do.

1566
02:11:20,568 --> 02:11:21,917
你能回去嗎?
Can you go back?

1567
02:11:23,963 --> 02:11:25,747
不,我不能。
No, I can't.

1568
02:11:28,576 --> 02:11:30,491
但這很好。
But it was good.

1569
02:11:30,534 --> 02:11:32,406
不改變。
That don't change.

1570
02:11:37,324 --> 02:11:38,891
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1571
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:43,765
生活是殘酷的。
Life is brutal.

1572
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:03,437
這裏的一切看起來都一樣。
Everything looks the same here.

1573
02:12:05,787 --> 02:12:07,658
什麼都沒有改變。
Nothing's changed.

1574
02:12:09,747 --> 02:12:11,314
你不覺得嗎?
Don't you think?

1575
02:12:15,318 --> 02:12:17,364
不，艾麗，我沒有。
No, Ally, I don't.

1576
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:21,890
在我看來，一切都不一樣了。
It all looks different to me.

1577
02:12:23,805 --> 02:12:26,329
我都認不出來了。
I don't hardly recognize it anymore.
