00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:20,414
THE WEEK OF THE KILLER

2
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,825
- The minister secretary general
of the movement

3
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,620
and vice president of the council,
Mr. Fernandez Miranda--

4
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,582
- Ernie says, in this weather,
it's much better to have consommeÃ©.

5
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,209
But this soup will fill you up good, huh.

6
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,422
It's real chicken and no preservatives.

7
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,592
Not like they use where
you work at, Marcos.

8
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,555
- Listen, Rosa, the soups we make
in the factory aren't that bad.

9
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,392
- "Soup from Flory
has all the right ingredients."

10
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,643
Yes.

11
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,605
It tastes like mother used to make.

12
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,774
- But it's nowhere near
as good as yours, Rosa.

13
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,945
It's really getting hot.

14
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,906
- What spree do you have prepared for later?

15
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,658
- Well, the same as every Sunday.

16
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,662
I'll take the girl to the movies,
we'll have a spin,

17
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,955
and then, you know.

18
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,124
- When are you going to look for
a woman to marry?

19
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,334
It's about time.

20
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,753
- Come on Rosa, don't get caught up.
There is much to do.

21
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,421
Can't you hear me or what?

22
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,380
- I'm going, I'm going.

23
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,883
And then he says
to be nice to customers.

24
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,804
- I always give my family
the best food that I can find.

25
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,640
That's why I give them Flory Soup,

26
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,851
because Flory soups have...

27
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,521
Mmm... the flavor of good, rich meat.

28
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,278
- Hello.

29
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,780
- It's about time, right?

30
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,156
- We finished eating very late.

31
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,992
- If I went looking for you at your house,
I wouldn't have to wait like a fool.

32
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,371
- I've told you a thousand times,
they think I go out with guys my age,

33
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,666
you don't know how he'd get if he knew
that I was dating a man like you.

34
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,414
- Come on, speak, what do you think?

35
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,625
If you're getting bored,
say so, but speak up.

36
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,254
- Sometimes I think that
we will never get married.

37
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,340
Men your age
date a younger girl

38
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,717
to get married right away,

39
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,510
but you don't talk about that,

40
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,054
you only talk about the factory, your work,

41
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,557
not about earning more
so that we can get married.

42
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,352
- If you want to break up, say so.

43
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,360
Paula, I--

44
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,321
- But I love you, Marcos.

45
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,323
- We will get married.

46
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,867
They will give me a better
position in the factory,

47
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,868
trust me.

48
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,370
- Yes, Marcos, yes.

49
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,469
- We're very far from the metro,
what should we do? It's very late.

50
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,928
- Don't worry, we'll take a taxi.

51
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,018
Look, here comes one.

52
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,815
Taxi, taxi.

53
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,525
- Taxi.

54
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:54,826
- Hello.

55
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:56,787
- Good evening.

56
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,464
- Pinchado is in, scoring
the third goal for his team.

57
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,299
He got the ball in from the right side--

58
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,884
- Madrid's third goal. They are crazy.

59
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,261
- Nicho was defending the goal
when he threw himself

60
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,721
to the left to stop it.

61
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,932
This almost always happens--

62
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,809
- Well, look at that, very good.

63
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,107
- Three to zero, Real Madrid wins.

64
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,945
And now we see how Miguel Munoz
will deliver for his team, for the fans,

65
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,365
because it seems Merengue is
going to let Fleitas in,

66
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,494
a beloved player and expected by all
the followers of the Merengue team.

67
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,830
Mr. Santana tells him to retire,

68
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,043
we'll see. Fleitas, however,
says he is going to indicate--

69
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,672
- This is as far as we go.

70
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,716
- What's going on?

71
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,300
- What do you mean, what's going on?

72
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,969
What do you think my taxi is?

73
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,679
You have the whole field to do that.

74
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,180
- Hey, nobody messed with you.

75
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,100
- It would be good for
you to mess with me.

76
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,227
- Have you never had a girlfriend or what?

77
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,229
What did you do back then?
Play Parcheesi? Okay.

78
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,481
- And why do you care?

79
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,734
- What we do is none
of your business either.

80
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,361
- It so happens that you are in my taxi.

81
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,405
- Please, Marcos, let's go, don't argue.

82
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,908
- Yes, leave, you can still seize the night.

83
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,952
If you were my daughter,
I would give you a--

84
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,413
If at least you were with a boy your age.

85
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,456
- Okay, that's enough.
Okay?

86
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,625
Come on, and shove your taxi
up your you know what.

87
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:28,879
- Just a moment,

88
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,382
don't run, the meter here shows 23 pesetas.

89
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,010
Surely, you don't expect me
to give you the ride for free, right?

90
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,012
- Well, you should have
taken us where we said.

91
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,808
- Hey, sir, or you... I don't
even know how to treat you.

92
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,352
What are you saying? That you won't pay me?

93
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,437
- Not a penny.

94
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,732
And treat me as a sir, sir,
we don't know each other well yet.

95
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,484
- Pay him, Marcos, don't look for trouble.

96
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,067
- Come on.

97
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,652
- It's good advice, you know?

98
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,946
This night could turn into
a bad memory for you.

99
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,282
- Your father will pay you,
understand? Your father.

100
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:00,827
- You beast.

101
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,579
- Now you'll see, I'm
going to give you the

102
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,247
slap your father didn't
give you on time.

103
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,666
- Marcos.

104
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,421
Marcos.

105
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,515
- Let's go, quickly.

106
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,101
- You think so?

107
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,187
- Sure, that was
a minor blow.

108
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,689
- Don't walk with me anymore,
someone from my family could see us.

109
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:30,899
- Relax.

110
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,277
People are only killed
that easily in movies.

111
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,404
- Is there anything on my face?

112
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,113
- No.

113
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,574
- They're going to be so
angry at me for being late.

114
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,952
- I'll pick you up at the
supermarket tomorrow.

115
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,495
- No, wait for me at the bus stop.

116
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,372
- Okay, I'll wait for you at the stop.

117
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,374
- I won't be able to sleep.
I'm so nervous.

118
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,667
- Don't be silly.

119
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,378
- Goodbye.

120
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:02,848
- Come on.

121
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,686
- Hello.

122
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,021
Hey, walking the dog?

123
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,648
- Yes, like every night.

124
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,483
- I didn't think you'd be here.

125
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,944
Yesterday, your girl told me
you were going on vacation.

126
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,864
- Yes, my parents have left.
Tosca and I stayed by ourselves.

127
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,283
- Why did you stay here in this heat?

128
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,828
- I didn't feel like going.
Hey, you always address me formally, why?

129
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,372
- I'm just used to it.

130
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,500
- We've seen each other every time
I walk my dog, I don't know,

131
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,294
you can almost say that we're friends.

132
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,879
Do you smoke?

133
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:34,921
- Thank you.

134
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,680
- You seem pretty tired. Are you?

135
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,726
- No. I'm a little bit nervous.

136
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,438
I'm going to sleep, good night.

137
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,439
- See you tomorrow.

138
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,349
- Marcos, leave that wheelbarrow,
the chief of staff wants to speak with you.

139
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,851
- With me? What for?

140
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,228
- I don't know.
Go upstairs and find out.

141
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,610
TAXI DRIVER FOUND DEAD

142
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,127
- Marcos, what's up? Was there
something in the news about it?

143
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,962
- No, nothing.

144
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,131
- Don't lie to me.
- Yes, there was something about it.

145
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:42,924
I've killed him,

146
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,385
you were going to find out anyway.

147
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,931
Had he hit me with his knee,
maybe I would be the one dead.

148
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,727
Plus, when I saw him hitting you,
I couldn't contain myself.

149
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,734
Come on, don't cry.

150
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,861
Come on, let's go.

151
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:08,992
- Where are you taking me?

152
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,201
- To my house,

153
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,079
the only place
where we can talk quietly.

154
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,663
- And your brother?

155
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:14,622
Out with the truck.

156
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,249
He won't be back until
the day after tomorrow.

157
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,465
We have come to talk,

158
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,258
stop spinning that pack.

159
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,301
What is that?

160
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,806
- Plastic bags for the garbage can.

161
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,975
My mother asked me to get them.

162
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,102
- Okay.

163
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,731
- I'm scared, Marcos.

164
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,733
- Scared of what?

165
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,277
Nobody knows we took that taxi,

166
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:45,695
nobody saw us.

167
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,782
- They will find out.

168
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,532
- Not from me,

169
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,119
but if you keep making that face,
the whole world will find out.

170
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,292
Don't be silly,

171
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,004
trust me.

172
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,424
- Are you sure that
nothing will happen to us?

173
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,426
- Nothing.

174
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,707
- Do you want to smoke?

175
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,046
Are you still thinking about that?

176
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,173
Are you crying for that?

177
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,677
Are you crying for this?

178
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,183
See, you're just a little girl.

179
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,003
- Why don't we tell the police everything?

180
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,424
About what? What we just did?

181
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,468
- Don't try to be funny.

182
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,264
Really, Marcos, let's
go to the police station.

183
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,268
- We agreed that you were
going to let me handle everything.

184
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,482
- Yes, but after doing what we did,
we must do everything together.

185
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,277
- No one's going to the police.

186
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,238
- We can tell them how it happened,

187
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,407
that he hit us both.

188
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,908
- They won't believe anything.

189
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,410
And your family?

190
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,121
They don't even know you go out
with a man my age.

191
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,039
- We have to tell them,

192
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,835
because you want to marry me, right?

193
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,713
- Of course, silly.

194
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,215
- Let's go to the police.

195
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:34,841
- Don't be a moron.

196
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,638
If we go to the police,
we're going to spoil everything.

197
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,515
Do you know what time it is?

198
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,059
Around 10:00 PM,
it's getting pretty late.

199
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,238
You'll see, you'll think
differently tomorrow.

200
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,406
- I'll keep thinking the same.

201
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,701
- Me too, I don't want to be locked up.

202
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,578
- If you don't want to go, I'll go alone.

203
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,664
- Why would you go?
You behave more like a child every day.

204
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,126
- You just got me to
stop behaving like a child.

205
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,755
- Look, Paula, even if it's very late,
let's go back home,

206
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,465
we have to keep talking, come on.

207
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,136
- We can talk all you want,
but you won't get me to change my mind.

208
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,679
- At least listen to me, all right?

209
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,859
I'm not a kid your age, do you understand?

210
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,819
And when I say no, it's no.

211
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,697
- That's the bad thing,
if you were younger, you'd be braver.

212
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,283
- Well, you should have chosen better,
there are plenty of kids out there.

213
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,534
- You're hurting me, stop.

214
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,494
- Don't you see, Paula?

215
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,663
If we go to the police station,
if they take me to jail,

216
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,290
I'll be an old man when they let me out.

217
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,959
- How afraid are you of going to jail?

218
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,214
- You seem like you're
looking forward to it.

219
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,508
- No, but I don't want to
waste my life being afraid.

220
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,801
- You don't have to be afraid,

221
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,844
trust me.

222
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:06,432
- Trust you?
Sure, the mature, strong man, sure.

223
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,476
Do you know what you are?

224
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,603
A loser full of fear.

225
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,731
I don't know why you're so afraid of jail.

226
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,275
After all, you just want
to live in this shack

227
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,944
and continue being
a worker all your life.

228
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,696
- Is that what you think?

229
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:21,781
- Yes.

230
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,368
- Then go to the police or
wherever you want.

231
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,788
- Marcos.

232
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,999
- No, don't start with that now,
that you love me despite everything.

233
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,167
It wouldn't be true.

234
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:44,984
- Hello, Esteban.

235
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,528
- Hi, Marcos.

236
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,117
They have screwed me well, bro.

237
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,996
In the end, the trip to Burgos got ruined,

238
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,581
that's why I came a day earlier.

239
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,041
- Have you eaten yet?

240
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,126
- No, is there anything cold to drink?

241
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,836
- Nothing left, not even wine.

242
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,630
- Let's go to Rosa's tavern.

243
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,465
I've been in the truck
for six hours straight.

244
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,218
And as she persisted
in having a goodbye gift,

245
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,305
I bought her a wristwatch
that cost me 2,000 calas.

246
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,308
So, between that and the wedding expenses,

247
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,310
I haven't been able to afford much.

248
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,355
- Sure, from now on
the revelry is over.

249
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,608
- You must say that because of
all the fun you have being single.

250
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,569
From the factory to the house,
and from the house to the factory.

251
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,739
- Man, one takes what one can get.

252
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,699
- Hush, you're a weird guy.

253
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,826
It's unbelievable that I'm your brother.

254
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,912
- Here, a six for you to fold.

255
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,955
- Wow, there it goes. I fold.

256
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,708
- Come on, I thought I was winning this one.

257
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,752
- Have you been here long, Esteban?
- A few days.

258
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,130
I'm getting married next week.
I'll have to go to Levante for her.

259
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,257
- It's true, Carmen told
me something about that.

260
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,469
Treat her well, she's a good girl.

261
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:54,804
Don't scare her.

262
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,180
- She's not scared of anything.

263
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,517
- Wow. Let's see if you're
the one getting scared.

264
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,687
- Hey, could I leave the truck in the shed?

265
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,562
- Aren't you taking it?

266
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,440
- Yes, sure, to spend
the wedding night in the cabin?

267
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,360
Well, look, that way,
Carmen wouldn't take off running.

268
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,079
- Hey, Rosa, what do you give my brother
for him to be so dull?

269
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,456
- What do I give him? Nothing.

270
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,542
- I mean to eat, of course.

271
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,127
- Okay.

272
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:34,927
- Is something the matter?

273
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,221
- Yes.

274
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,556
- Come on.

275
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,475
Let it out, man. We're brothers, right?

276
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,686
- It's about my girlfriend.

277
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,396
- Girlfriend?

278
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,107
You're too old to be so stupid.

279
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,066
- No, it's not that.

280
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,569
It's somewhat more complicated.

281
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,029
- Come on, man. Tell me.

282
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,490
- Let's go home.
We can talk better there.

283
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,122
- Hey, Rosa.

284
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,165
- Coming.

285
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:05,916
- I'll come back later.

286
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,253
Is Agustin dealing tonight?

287
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,506
- Agustin starts snoring
as soon as the food is served.

288
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,967
Come if you want.

289
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,594
We can play, you and 1.

290
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,637
- To the Mus or the goose?

291
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,973
And I'll deal, because it's my turn.

292
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,189
- Are you crazy?

293
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,357
What happened? Did
she not allow you or what?

294
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,401
You could have put up with it.

295
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,404
- No, it's not that. It wasn't like that.

296
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,407
- Yeah, you wanted to scare her,
and it got out of hand.

297
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,910
If you had chosen Rosa,

298
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,245
nothing would have happened,

299
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,664
and you would have
eaten for free all your life.

300
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,000
- I'll tell you everything later,
but something has to be done.

301
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,126
You have to help me.

302
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,546
- We'll go to the police together.

303
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,882
We'll make something up.

304
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,009
- No. I don't want to go to the police.

305
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,221
We can put her in the truck and then--

306
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,931
- Don't act funny, we'll do none of that.

307
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,433
I don't want to see the
grays hanging around here.

308
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,394
What do you think?
That they won't look for the girl?

309
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,523
- But you don't want me to go to jail.

310
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,524
You--

311
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,027
- Yes. And you don't even care
that I've thrown away my money

312
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,321
on the flat I've already paid for,
the wedding and everything else.

313
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,075
- But Esteban, if you
don't help me, who will?

314
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,494
- Marcos,

315
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,998
you're entangled in a big mess,
and, in these cases,

316
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,042
there's no choice but to turn yourself in.

317
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,257
- I won't go.

318
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,807
- Look, it has never crossed my mind

319
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,517
to lay a finger on you,

320
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,479
but I'll take you to the police station,
even if I have to drag you by force.

321
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,070
- If you want me to go, I'll go.

322
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,366
No need for us to fight.

323
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,284
- Come on, Marcos.

324
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,121
The longer we wait, the worse.

325
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,447
- They're Paula's,

326
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,492
they got caught up here
when I carried her corpse.

327
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,119
- Don't think about that anymore,

328
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,955
what matters is that you confess
everything as soon as possible.

329
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,667
Yes.

330
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,929
- Look Marcos, it would be silly
of you to start crying now.

331
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,028
- Are you done working for the day?

332
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,738
- Yes, I'm leaving the factory now.

333
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,864
- He must be smelling a bitch,

334
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,283
do you know anyone
with a female boxer?

335
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,911
- No, all there is around here
is stray dogs.

336
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,996
- They're useless,
it must be another boxer.

337
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,207
- This one is not very handsome.

338
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,250
- You're right.

339
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,378
I think that tonight I'm going to let
him loose, so he can do what he can.

340
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,255
- Be careful, he could get eaten.

341
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,882
The dogs around here
are starving.

342
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,136
- I'm not afraid of that, a
well-fed animal is always stronger.

343
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,223
- You never know, nothing gives
you more strength than hunger.

344
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,142
- Don't be a demagogue.

345
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,894
- Don't be a what?

346
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,524
- Nothing man, nothing.
Don't get angry, it's not an insult.

347
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,025
So long, bye.

348
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,828
- I've been sitting here for an hour.
Where's your brother?

349
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,497
- He hasn't returned yet.

350
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,332
- Returned from where?

351
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,502
Yesterday he phoned me saying
that he was about to arrive.

352
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,715
- He's back from the trip already,
but he went out to run errands.

353
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,718
- This is the last straw.
He hasn't called me all day.

354
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,304
The wedding is in less than a week,

355
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,306
and we still have
to make many arrangements.

356
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,016
- Come on, Carmen, don't get nervous.

357
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,021
Do you want to come in?

358
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,106
- If you prefer, I'll wait here.

359
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:27,983
I suppose he'll be here soon.

360
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:39,953
It's almost 10:00 PM.

361
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,247
Where has this idiot gone?

362
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm not leaving until he gets back
and listens to me.

363
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,215
Hey, your house is super filthy.

364
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,635
It smells awful.

365
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,558
The thing is my father
is waiting for me to have dinner.

366
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,979
- He should get used to dining alone,
as soon as you get married--

367
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,232
- You don't know him well.

368
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,817
He still hasn't warmed up to the idea
that I'm going to get married,

369
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,778
he doesn't want to give me up.

370
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,863
Of course, he'll be so alone.

371
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,698
- If you're running late, go home.

372
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,576
As soon as Esteban
arrives, I'll tell him to call you.

373
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,535
- That hooligan.

374
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,039
What a bachelor party
he must be having.

375
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,001
The truth is, if I weren't so in love--

376
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,379
At least I'll get some jewelry.

377
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,843
Hey, Marcos, do you know if he brought
the gift he promised me?

378
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,473
- No, what was it?

379
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,225
- A wristwatch.

380
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,394
I'm sure he has it in his room, I'll check.

381
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,062
- No, don't go into the room.

382
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,483
- Man, what's up with you?

383
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,613
Well, he wants to surprise me.

384
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,784
He's so stupid, even when
he seems to be such a brute.

385
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,245
Come on, let me see.

386
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,830
- I told you not to go in.

387
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,584
- Okay, don't be like that.

388
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,005
You're so faithful
to your little brother and his secrets.

389
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,090
- I'm sorry, Carmen, but you see,

390
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,510
he told me he wants to surprise you.

391
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,554
Why would we spoil the surprise?

392
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,893
- Okay, okay, okay.

393
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,607
I'm starting to get a headache.

394
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,068
Do you have any aspirin lying around?

395
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,780
- I don't know,
maybe there's some in the kitchen.

396
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,283
- Go on, Marcos, be nice,

397
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,952
bring me a glass of water
and see if you can find an aspirin. Huh?

398
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,179
- Do you really want
me to go get an aspirin?

399
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,473
- Yes, my head hurts a lot.

400
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,517
- As you wish.

401
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,305
- Here's the glass of water.

402
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,727
I'm sorry, Carmen,
but I couldn't find an aspirin.

403
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,398
I'm really sorry.

404
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,025
Take the water.

405
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,674
- What's up? Getting some fresh air?

406
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,636
- Yes.

407
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,846
Did you finish with that girl yet?

408
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,183
Come on kid,

409
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,353
I saw that a girl was waiting for you
while you were coming home,

410
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:39,771
and she looked pretty good,

411
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:41,648
you could introduce her to me.

412
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,360
- No, it's not what you think,

413
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,321
plus, she just left.

414
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,824
- Is that why you're so tired?

415
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,584
- Yes, it must be, I don't know, the heat.

416
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,169
- Yes. It's a horrible night.

417
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,423
You know what? I've released the dog,

418
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,550
I'm going to let it walk
around for two hours.

419
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,553
Do you want to go for a spin?

420
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,015
- No, it's very late.

421
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,642
- Come on, man,

422
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,770
don't make me wait for
Trosqui to come back.

423
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,038
- It's curious,

424
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,582
we've seen each other
every night for a long time,

425
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,584
and I don't even know your name.

426
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,795
My name is Nestor.
And you are?

427
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:46,838
- Marcos.

428
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,882
- We know each other a little more now.

429
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,093
- What interest can you have
in knowing someone like me?

430
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,889
You must have friends your age,
important people.

431
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,016
- Important people are very boring,

432
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,018
they always have a solution for everything.

433
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,229
- That must be great,
to have solutions for everything.

434
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,357
- You know what?

435
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,654
You'll think that I'm a fool,
but in the middle of so much darkness

436
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:11,613
I'm starting to get scared.

437
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,907
- Scared?

438
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,618
Why?

439
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:19,496
- I don't know, it's easy to
be afraid, especially at night.

440
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,167
I told you, you'll think that I'm a fool.

441
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:27,671
Look, there's a refreshment stand
behind the esplanade.

442
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,131
Let's go there, my mouth is dry.

443
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,560
I'm thinking we're two weird guys.

444
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,105
- Yes? Why?

445
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:47,691
- It's obvious.

446
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,612
I should be, like you said,
with people my age,

447
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,031
dancing at a discotheque,

448
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,575
spending the summer in Torremolinos,

449
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,704
and racing down the highways
at 140 per hour,

450
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,250
and you should be married

451
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,045
to a woman beginning to get plump,
have a couple of kids,

452
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,589
with a washing machine bill pending

453
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,010
and the illusion that one day
you can buy a 600.

454
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:34,988
- It's curious.

455
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,116
Without knowing why, suddenly,

456
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,870
I get the impression
that all my worries,

457
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,288
I don't know,

458
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,834
that they've disappeared, like--
when you wake up from a dream

459
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,590
and you're happy because
all that horrible stuff is a lie

460
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:58,553
and nothing has happened. And
then you eat your breakfast very calmly.

461
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,765
You're right,

462
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,310
we're two pretty weird guys.

463
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,148
- I have a friend with a long beard
and very thick glasses,

464
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,359
who would say that you
and I are two outcasts.

465
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,029
- What? Two what?

466
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,950
- Nothing, intellectual quarrels.

467
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,885
- Police. Documentation, please.

468
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,971
- Yes, yes, right away.

469
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,753
- You, where's your ID?

470
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,673
- Sorry, I don't have it with me.

471
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,299
- No identification?

472
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:19,717
- I left it at the house.

473
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:21,845
- What are you doing
here at this time of night?

474
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,306
- Passing the time, and having a drink.

475
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,643
Don't you know it's the law that you
have to carry some kind of identity card?

476
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,020
- I'm sorry.

477
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,025
Excuse me, Inspector, I know the young man,

478
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,986
he lives in this new building over there.

479
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:44,117
- Oh, he lives over there, in
one of those high-rise apartments.

480
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,121
Well, in that case, just don't forget

481
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,499
you should always carry
your identity card with you.

482
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,712
We have to be careful. You never
know what we might find out here.

483
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:57,463
Good evening.

484
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,049
- So long, Inspector.
Always good to see you.

485
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,763
- I like your house.
There are few like that left.

486
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,099
- I don't.

487
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,226
- Why do you live there?

488
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,730
I've been told that almost everyone
who lived in these houses

489
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,190
have gone to those colonies
that they've built back there.

490
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,402
- Someday they'll build them here too,
and I'll have to go.

491
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,362
- It's a pity.

492
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,908
By the way, you have to show me
the inside of your home.

493
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:32,290
- There's very little to see, old junk,
damp and dirty walls.

494
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:37,003
If I don't leave, it's
because it's full of memories.

495
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,504
- Bury them.

496
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,839
- How?

497
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:42,759
- Bury the memories.

498
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,221
Here he comes.

499
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:52,435
Hello, Trosqui. Did you have fun?

500
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,773
- I'm going, it's very late.

501
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,275
- Trosqui and I are leaving
too. See you tomorrow.

502
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,028
- Goodbye.

503
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,905
- Hey, thanks for the company.

504
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,281
- You're welcome, man, you too.

505
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,078
- How? You at this hour, Mr. Ambrosio?

506
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,246
- Where's your brother?

507
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,290
- You know, he's with the truck.
He hasn't come back yet.

508
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,501
- Yesterday, Carmen came to see him.

509
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,294
She told me he was here already.

510
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,171
- Want some?
- No.

511
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,297
- That's weird.

512
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,883
Carmen must have been confused.

513
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,928
- Look, let's see if we
understand each other.

514
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,764
Yesterday my daughter left home at 5:00 PM,

515
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,642
it's 6:00 AM and she hasn't come back yet.

516
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,272
- How could you think
they're here?

517
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,152
Listen, Mr. Ambrosio.

518
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:32,910
- Get away from the door, let me in.

519
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,370
- No.

520
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,840
- Carmen knows that when she gets married,
I'm going to be lonely.

521
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,342
But she doesn't seem to care much

522
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,928
when she couldn't even stay
for the remaining days, that--

523
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,680
- Man, it's not so bad.

524
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,476
- If my deceased wife was here--

525
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,190
If I was 10 years younger,

526
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,776
you would not prevent me
from entering that room.

527
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:09,113
You and Esteban would know who I am.

528
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,577
But be careful,
this isn't going to stay like this.

529
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,621
- Mr. Ambrosio.
- What?

530
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,416
- Okay.

531
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,169
Go into the room, if you want.

532
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:27,924
Let's see if that calms you down.

533
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,708
- What?

534
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,794
Are you ashamed to look me in the face?

535
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:10,109
- We start our program in the morning with
joy, good vibes, and upbeat music.

536
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,690
- There's not much today, people
have chosen not to eat meat this week.

537
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,026
- It's not like the dog eats like a tiger.

538
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,403
- Good morning. A coffee with milk.

539
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,738
- I'm going, Marcos.

540
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,781
- What? To work?

541
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,578
- You're right. Hey, I didn't know you
got up so early, too.

542
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,456
- No, I'm not getting up
early. I'm staying up late.

543
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,916
I haven't gone to bed yet.

544
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,169
- Partying?

545
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:23,047
- No, I've been writing all night.

546
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,050
- To whom? To your parents?

547
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:30,763
- No, I write scripts for movies.
It's fun.

548
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:32,973
- Do you make movies?

549
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,519
- Well, maybe someday I'll make one.

550
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,313
I don't know.
Maybe when I get my inheritance.

551
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,814
- I have to go.

552
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,441
Rosa, here you go.

553
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:43,442
- Okay.

554
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,611
You should come around more often.

555
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:50,741
- Do you play sports?

556
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,868
- Yes, I go to the gym.

557
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,246
- It weighs a lot, doesn't it?

558
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,289
Do you dedicate yourself to lifting stones?

559
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:01,335
- No, it's just that I've
put my work stuff in.

560
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,003
See you later.

561
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,799
- I can come with you to play sports any day.
That hardens the bones.

562
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,638
Trosqui, don't get bothersome.

563
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,516
- I'm leaving, I'm late.

564
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,101
- We'll see you later, right?

565
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,520
- Maybe. See you later.

566
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:09,737
- Thank you.

567
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,989
And, you?

568
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,367
- I want something to make
my house smell good.

569
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:16,994
What they spray in movie theaters.

570
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,787
- An environment purifier.

571
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,331
- That. Give me six.

572
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,167
- They come in different kinds and sizes,

573
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:27,838
but we have this at a very discounted
price, and it smells of pine. Glorious.

574
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,805
Anything else?

575
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,599
- Cologne.
- What kind?

576
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,227
- One with a strong scent.

577
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,772
- There are many types of cologne.

578
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:49,485
But I have one that's very fresh, very
perfumed and with a strong graduation.

579
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:50,444
- I'll take 10.

580
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,529
- What? 107

581
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,491
Jesus, how much cologne can one need?

582
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:04,208
No, not like that.

583
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,507
Smell it, do you like it?

584
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,053
It's called Aromas of the Harem. Okay?

585
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,554
- Yes.

586
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,390
- Anything else?

587
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:20,974
- No, nothing else.

588
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,936
- Your wife will be very happy

589
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,272
because she'll have cologne
for a long time.

590
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,899
- I'm not married.

591
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,359
- Oh, you're not?

592
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,152
You do very well.

593
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:37,282
Also, I warn you that this cologne
can also be used by a gentleman

594
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,784
without the slightest qualm.

595
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,371
- What do I owe you?
- 500 pesetas.

596
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,965
Thank you.

597
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,801
Don't you want to take the coupons?

598
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,769
- Come on. Get out. Out of here.

599
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:11,734
Come on, out, out. Out of here.

600
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,396
- Do you want dinner?

601
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,692
- Yes, but I'll have a snack somewhere.

602
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,445
- Wait, I haven't had dinner either.

603
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,365
Come on.

604
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:50,123
Are you okay?

605
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,378
- Yes. And Agustin?

606
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,338
- Snoring like always.

607
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,424
Your brother, where is he?

608
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,971
- He went to town, had to get
some papers for the wedding.

609
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,390
- I was very surprised not to see him,

610
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,185
and it's funny, it's been a while since
I've seen Carmen and her father.

611
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:14,189
- Of course. You know,
Carmen and her father live alone,

612
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,733
they have to do it all by themselves.

613
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,153
- Do you want anything else to eat?

614
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,239
- No, I'm not hungry anymore.

615
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,616
- I'll make you a glass of milk
with a couple of yolks.

616
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,493
- Really, don't. I'm not hungry.

617
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,953
- You won't even feel it in your stomach.

618
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,211
Come on, take it.

619
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,760
Finish it off, you look really sad
these days.

620
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,804
God knows what you're up to.

621
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,933
Wow, sorry, man.
We'll fix it right away.

622
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,311
- It's okay,
these are my work clothes.

623
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,009
- Done. As soon as they dry,
you'll be ready.

624
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,512
- Thank you for serving me even
though it's closed. What do I owe you?

625
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,514
- Nothing, it's on the house.

626
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,099
- Rosa--

627
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,894
- Don't be silly.
I told you it's on me, and that's it.

628
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,356
- Thank you, Rosa.

629
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,702
- Hi, did I scare you?

630
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,039
- Honestly, you did.
- Sorry, it was a joke.

631
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,290
What are you doing here?

632
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,668
- I just had dinner and was going home.

633
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,211
- Would you like to go for a swim?

634
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:01,964
- A swim? Where?

635
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:05,133
- I know a pool that's open
until dawn, are you coming?

636
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:38,120
- Come on, we're here.

637
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,998
- I fell asleep completely.

638
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:43,959
- It's common, you get up very early.

639
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:46,378
- I think it's weird.

640
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,297
I should be wide awake,

641
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:51,800
and I've slept like a child.

642
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,719
- If I were a curious person,
I'd ask what's going on with you,

643
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:57,305
but I'm not a curious person.

644
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,599
- I'm going.

645
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,018
I really liked that site.

646
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,395
- Have a nice rest.

647
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,397
Take advantage of the
hours of sleep you have left.

648
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:06,648
- See you tomorrow.

649
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,515
- Look, here he comes.

650
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:44,811
Do you play sports now, bro?
- Yes, boxing.

651
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:45,770
- Look at him, Hurtain,

652
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,732
he's smashing the bag.
Are you wearing gloves?

653
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:51,067
Shut up, what a sight
the veteran has become.

654
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,819
- We're not going to spoil it.

655
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,780
Come on, take off the gloves
and warm up a little, man.

656
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,826
- Stop joking, it's time.
Don't be kids.

657
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,952
- Pass it to me.

658
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,037
- There it goes. Come on.

659
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:02,996
- Get it.

660
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,707
- Here, here. Manolo, here.

661
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,584
- Here, come on.

662
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,961
- Me, me, me. Mine.

663
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,338
- Me, me, me.

664
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:13,465
- It's so heavy. Come on, it weighs a lot.

665
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:14,674
Here.

666
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,010
- Hey, man, what's going on here?

667
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,220
- Don't you see how much this weighs?

668
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,348
It smells like cologne and rotten stuff.

669
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,768
Take the bag, rich man, and put it away,
make sure they don't take it away from you.

670
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,895
This veteran gets on your nerves

671
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:29,940
since they made him a
specialized worker. Go now.

672
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:18,196
All objects not used at work

673
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,573
must be left in the locker room.

674
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:23,136
- Marcos,

675
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,847
the soup is on the table.

676
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,823
- Don't let it cool, this soup
isn't like the others.

677
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,661
As soon as it cools down, it gets thick
and no one wants to eat it.

678
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,711
You don't like it very much, do you?

679
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,463
- What's wrong with this one?

680
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,051
It's not as bad as it seems, man.

681
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,720
- What happened?
Are you feeling okay?

682
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:07,347
- I'm going.

683
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm going to work.

684
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,558
- Take some of the battered cow brains

685
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,395
that we have as a second course,
even the ill eat that.

686
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:15,397
- Tomorrow I'll feel better.

687
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:18,108
- Come on, go home and lie down.

688
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,028
- Is something wrong, Marcos?

689
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,490
- Something I ate, I feel bad.

690
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,742
- Can I get you something? An aspirin?

691
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,745
- No, thanks, I'm okay.

692
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,623
I'll be all right.

693
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,501
- As you wish.

694
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:27,886
- See you later.

695
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,638
- Where are you going?
- Don't you hear? To mass.

696
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:34,601
- To mass? But you haven't gone to church
since Faustino died.

697
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:35,935
- Look, I'm going today, Corcho.

698
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,939
My mother died eight years ago
today. Goodbye.

699
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,317
- Hey, what about the veil?

700
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,321
- Oh, come on. No one wears a veil anymore.

701
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,781
- As soon as the blessing is done, return,

702
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,576
because I'm not going to paint
the labels and cook tapas alone, be--

703
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,047
- Who is it?
- Open up, Marcos. It's me, Rosa.

704
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:12,013
Marcos, how are you feeling?

705
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,351
- Good, I'm better now.
- I'm glad.

706
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:18,603
I was just passing by,
I thought that if you were worse,

707
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,230
someone would have to bring you food.

708
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:22,232
- No, I'm fine now.

709
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,735
- I'm glad, man. Won't you invite me in?

710
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,366
- If you want to.

711
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,958
- I have to see how the house of
a man living alone is kept.

712
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,085
Have you had breakfast?

713
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:46,297
- No, I just woke up.

714
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,175
- Man, come on, lie down again
while I make you breakfast.

715
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:50,969
I brought you an ensaimada.

716
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,763
Hey, what does it smell like in here?

717
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,141
- Smells? Yes, of course it smells.

718
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,185
A pipe has burst.

719
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:00,562
- Do you have milk at home?

720
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:02,897
- There must be some around there.

721
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:04,732
- Go lay down at once.

722
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,859
- No need, I feel better now.

723
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,612
- Don't be silly. 1
prepare more than 100

724
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,614
breakfasts every day,
one more is no bother.

725
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:15,368
The smell is coming from there.

726
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:20,582
Who knows how much crap
you have in that room.

727
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,776
Your breakfast is ready.

728
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,696
- Thank you, Rosa.
You're very kind.

729
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:57,577
- No. Don't get up, it's better to lay down.

730
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,254
You aren't eating the ensaimada.

731
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,965
- Later, I don't feel like it now.

732
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:33,423
- Now, you'll let me come from
time to time to fix all this mess for you.

733
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,843
A woman is needed in a house.

734
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:39,846
Right now, I'm going
to fix that room for you.

735
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:42,056
A foul smell is coming from inside.

736
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,307
- No, no. Don't do anything,

737
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,643
it's just that we don't use it much,
and it doesn't have good ventilation.

738
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,478
Also, I already told you
that the smell is from a pipe.

739
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,981
- No, no. It's not the smell
of a broken pipe.

740
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,149
You'll see.

741
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,943
Right now, I'll fix your room,
clean it, and let the air in.

742
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,903
Otherwise, you'll catch an infection.

743
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,742
- Don't you understand?

744
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,327
I don't want you to go in there.

745
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:07,290
- Well, sweetie, really?

746
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,920
- Sorry, Rosa, but I wouldn't
want you to suspect--

747
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,046
- Suspect?

748
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,301
Suspect what?

749
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:40,323
Sorry, Marcos, but I have to go.

750
01:17:41,783 --> 01:17:43,242
Gee, I've been here over an hour.

751
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,162
I don't know what I'm
going to tell Agustin.

752
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,834
Because today we have a lot
of work at the bar, it's Sunday.

753
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:54,921
Of course you know that already.

754
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,589
- Don't leave me alone, Rosa.

755
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,884
Yes, I know it doesn't smell good in here.

756
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:04,472
But look, we'll remove the bad smell.

757
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:08,476
Only you can clean that room for me.
Do you understand?

758
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,855
I've been so happy since you
brought that ensaimada for me.

759
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,525
I never eat breakfast at home, you know.

760
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:20,279
I was so happy when you said that you
were going to help me clean everything.

761
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,281
- Tomorrow.

762
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:27,662
Yes, tomorrow I'll come
and fix the whole house.

763
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:31,707
It's just that I'm wearing my Sunday
clothes and I might stain them.

764
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,876
I'll be back tomorrow.

765
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:39,674
- You see? There, it no longer smells.

766
01:18:40,508 --> 01:18:42,009
Well, it still smells
a bit, but very little.

767
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,012
Tomorrow I'll buy more jars.

768
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,347
They're very cheap, you know?

769
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,515
And they smell like pine.

770
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:49,642
Don't you smell pine?

771
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,147
The other smell still remains,

772
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,359
very little, but still, right?

773
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:02,905
It's very weird, you know?

774
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:05,867
Sometimes, I don't
notice that it smells bad.

775
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,120
It's like when you work a lot and sweat.

776
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:13,457
Sweat smells, but you don't notice it
because you're the one who smells,

777
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:14,792
you know?

778
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:19,505
The same happens with
this, suddenly it smells.

779
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:26,095
- Yes, I understand.
So long, Marcos.

780
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,723
You'll come to eat, right?

781
01:19:28,723 --> 01:19:31,100
Today we have a delicious paella.

782
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:35,438
- Why did you have to
come this morning, Rosa?

783
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:37,398
- Marcos.

784
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,192
Marcos.

785
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:57,788
- What happened?

786
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,998
- His paw is broken.

787
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,340
- I could tell someone.

788
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,471
- Yes, it's best to call a vet, right?

789
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,807
- You'll see, they won't want to come.

790
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,837
- Come on, get out of here. Come on.

791
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:30,858
- What are you doing?

792
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:37,656
- I don't know.

793
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:39,867
- I see you're very lonely.

794
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:42,995
- I almost always am.

795
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:45,331
- Today more than ever.

796
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,833
Why don't you go into your house?

797
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:50,586
- I don't feel like going in.

798
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:53,923
- Then come to mine.

799
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,759
- To yours?

800
01:24:58,219 --> 01:24:59,178
- Why not?

801
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:05,017
We can have a drink, chat,
be bored together.

802
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,424
I locked the dog out so we could talk.

803
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,302
Sometimes it's too much,
you know what I mean?

804
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,513
We need ice,

805
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:44,473
come with me to the kitchen.

806
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:50,771
My mother didn't want
to leave me alone here.

807
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,316
She was afraid I'd have parties
and get into trouble,

808
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:56,318
but she doesn't know.

809
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:58,988
- What happened?

810
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,199
- I cut myself, it's not the first time
with these damn things.

811
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:06,287
- Don't do it that way.
It's better with cold water.

812
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,455
It'll soon be okay.

813
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:14,211
- I know a lot of people who get ill
when they see blood.

814
01:26:15,004 --> 01:26:16,505
You're not the same way about blood.

815
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:20,301
- No, it doesn't bother me in the least.

816
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:24,013
- I've locked up the dog,
So we can be more relaxed.

817
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:25,973
Do you want sparkling water?

818
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:27,933
- Okay.

819
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:52,708
- Do you like soccer?

820
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:55,252
- A bit.

821
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:12,436
- A nice view, you know?

822
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:23,739
They're good binoculars,
they have a lot of magnification.

823
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,999
Look. Now I'm looking at your house,

824
01:27:35,376 --> 01:27:37,419
the small window with flower curtains,

825
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:41,048
the window of the
living room, the skylight.

826
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:45,344
By the way, you've left the light on.

827
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:46,887
Look.

828
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,814
Turn the little wheel sideways
SO you can see it well.

829
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,634
- Have you noticed? You
can see everything clearly.

830
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,218
- Do you look much through these binoculars?

831
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:09,511
- Yes.

832
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,018
It is very exciting.

833
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:42,377
Bury them.

834
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,297
Bury them.

835
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:51,553
Is something wrong with you, Marcos?

836
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:55,807
What are you doing?

837
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:13,385
- Take this,

838
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:17,723
you need it.

839
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:23,770
Don't break it.

840
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:39,870
- Have I scared you much?

841
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:44,458
- Man, they don't try to
cut my throat open every day.

842
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:57,387
- You weren't afraid.

843
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,140
Fear shows,

844
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:06,271
it feels like something thick,

845
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:10,984
and you were not afraid.

846
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:14,154
- Yes, it's funny.

847
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:15,656
I wasn't afraid.

848
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:18,659
Maybe, I told you, it's
because I'm a strange guy.

849
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,828
Or, maybe because I
think you're not a murderer.

850
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,957
Although most likely,
it's that I don't mind dying.

851
01:32:51,108 --> 01:32:52,150
- This whiskey is good.

852
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:56,947
Not that I know much
about it, but I like it.

853
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:02,452
What have you seen
through those binoculars?

854
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,000
What do you know about me?

855
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,168
- Not much.

856
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:12,003
You're alone,

857
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:15,132
you're sad, you need help,

858
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:16,800
and I want to help you.

859
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:19,845
- Why?

860
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,179
I don't know.

861
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,931
Does there have to be a reason?

862
01:33:24,391 --> 01:33:25,350
- There always is.

863
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,770
No one has ever helped me for free.

864
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,355
- Never?
- Never.

865
01:33:30,897 --> 01:33:32,190
- I would like to help you

866
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,484
for free.

867
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:37,362
You don't believe me?

868
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,170
- Yes,

869
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:55,505
I believe you.

870
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:05,140
I'm leaving.

871
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:06,641
- Why are you leaving?

872
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:08,435
- Yes, Nestor, I'm leaving.

873
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:11,188
You don't have to walk me
to the door,

874
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:13,023
I remember the way.

875
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,115
Thanks for the whiskey,

876
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,659
and thank you

877
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,579
for everything.

878
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:39,526
Police,

879
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,364
I've killed six people.

880
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,536
I'm waiting for you outside my home.

881
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:55,166
Write down

882
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:56,668
my address.
