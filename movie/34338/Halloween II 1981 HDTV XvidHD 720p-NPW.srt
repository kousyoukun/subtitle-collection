1
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,398
I want you to listen to me. I want you
to go out of the house...

2
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,099
...and down the street
to the MacKenzies' house.

3
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,808
I want you to knock on their door.

4
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,061
I want you to tell them to call the police
and send'em over here.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,437
All right?

6
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,356
Laurie. - Do as I say.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,401
Go.

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,757
Get help!

9
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:31,925
Come on!

10
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,385
Come on!

11
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,791
Oh, no.

12
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,802
Help!

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,795
It was the boogeyman.

14
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,718
As a matter of fact...

15
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,136
it was.

16
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,569
What's going on out here?

17
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,695
Call the police!

18
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,447
Tell the sheriff I shot him!

19
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,172
Who?

20
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,659
Tell him he's still on the loose!
- Is this some kind of joke?

21
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,245
I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight!

22
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,581
You don't know what death is!

23
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,751
Trick or treat.

24
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,360
I shot him six times!

25
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,488
What?
- I shot him six times!

26
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,574
I... I shot him in the heart and...

27
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,369
He cannot get a very far, come on.
- I shot him six times!

28
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,746
This guy...

29
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,582
he's not human!

30
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,441
Harold, you want mayonnaise
on your sandwich?

31
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,782
How about mustard?

32
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,039
Up next some more spine melting madness
"Night of the Living Dead"

33
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Are you asleep again?

34
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,469
This is a WWAR special bulletin...

35
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,959
Police in Haddonfield have just made the
grisly discovery of three bodies...

36
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,560
...in the upstairs bedrooms of this house.

37
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:22,062
It appears that the murders took
place some time early this evening.

38
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,732
Authorities have confirmed
that all three of the victims are teenagers.

39
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,526
Two girls and a boy.

40
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,491
Police are searching the entire area for
a middle patient, who escaped last night

41
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:34,492
...from the Smith's Grow
Warren county sanitorium.

42
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,327
He is now believed to be
at large in Haddonfield.

43
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,371
This is Robert Mundy... live.

44
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,214
They're coming to get you Barbara.

45
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,926
- You're ignorant.
- They're coming for you, Barbara.

46
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,096
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

47
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,723
They're coming for you.

48
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:58,740
Look...

49
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,601
There comes one of them now.

50
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,936
She'll hear you.
Here he comes now.

51
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,646
I'm gettitng out of here.

52
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,669
Mrs. Elrod?!

53
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,506
Mr. Elrod?

54
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,384
Are you ok?

55
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,565
Hi.

56
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,401
There was someone screaming next door.

57
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,029
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

58
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,573
His wife's always picking on him.

59
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,910
He probably got angry and
decided to start beating her.

60
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,164
Ok, deal.

61
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,707
Are your folks home?

62
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,751
They are gone.

63
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:12,756
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Harden
County and my mother's decided to go along.

64
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,174
Didn't you hear?

65
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,592
Hear about what?

66
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,886
Some girl got killed in Haddonfield.

67
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,596
It's on the radio.

68
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,139
Hold on.

69
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,811
...and the police have
curtain off the entire area

70
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:26,645
to repeat...

71
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,491
Three teenagers have been
found murdered...

72
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,086
in the house in the Northwest
section of Haddonfield.

73
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,487
The names of the teenagers
have not been released...

74
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:34,588
I can't believe it.

75
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,445
I know.

76
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,739
- You know we probably knew her.
- Where did it happen?

77
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,366
Down on Orange Grove.

78
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,870
- That's right down the street.
- I know.

79
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,957
Police confirmed the girl
was rescued that she...

80
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,358
Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.

81
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,126
They said the guy got away.

82
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,170
- Do they know who it was?
- No.

83
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,131
Oh, god.

84
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,383
Alice?

85
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,759
Alice...

86
00:11:59,094 --> 00:11:59,970

00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,388

00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,561

90
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,466
- Who is it? - Chief to the Haddonfield

91
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:13,067
He believe that suspect
will be apprehended...

92
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,735
...within a matter of hours.

93
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,366
Neighboor say they heard scream
during the early evening,

94
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,367
...but activity a noise
it's for usual haloween.

95
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,933
I came out on the lawn.
I asked him what was going on.

96
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,726
- He said...
- Inside you guys.

97
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,645
He said he'd shot somebody.

98
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,510
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

99
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:48,704
Laurie?

100
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,164
Can you hear me?
- Don't let them put me to sleep.

101
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,944
It's all right, take it easy.
We're gonna go to clinic, all right?

102
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,045
- Don't let them put me to sleep.
- It's ok.

103
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,387
Hey...

104
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,221
you know this chick?

105
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,766
Yeh, her name's Laurie Strode.

106
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,685
She goes to school with
my little brother Ziggy.

107
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,521
- Her old man... eh Strode Realty?
- Yeah.

108
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,731

00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,959
Ok, just get out easy.

110
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,252
It's gonna be ok.

111
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,338
Just walk real slow, ok?

112
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,382
Are you all right?
Are you all right, hon?

113
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,011
Oh, god.

114
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,134

00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,747
Well, we should see
the doctor right away.

118
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,499
He's with a patient.
Would you please wait in room "A"?

119
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,543
Come on honey. Thank you.

120
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,380
Where's Doc. Mixter?

121
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,424
He's been at the country club.
I think he's drunk.

122
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,758
Oh, great.

123
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:07,926
What've we got?

124
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,725
Stub wound, left anterior chest,
possibly penetrating. Multiple...

125
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,726

... fractured right ankle.

126
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,060
Janet, get me some more coffee.

127
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,687
Get that out of here.

128
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,025
Oh, Laurie.

129
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,610
Hi there.

130
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,863
Well let's see what we have here.

131
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,281
Ah yes...

132
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,366
you lost a lot of blood.

133
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,785
We'll need to a type it.

134
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,876
When was the last time
you had a tetatus shot?

135
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,628
I don't know.

136
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,010
Get me some...

137
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,638

- Cutting needle?

138
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:53,805
- Yes.
- Right away.

139
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,974
We're going to have to put her out.
- No!

140
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,727
No, don't put me to sleep.
- Ok, relax.

141
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,187
Nylon's not gonna hurt you.

142
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,438
No.

143
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,526
Please don't put me to sleep.

144
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,196
Take it easy.

145
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,661
Try to relax, Laurie.

146
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,374
Doctor Mixter have you
stitched up in no time.

147
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,626
Take it easy, Laurie.

148
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,797
Circle the block again.

149
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,508
How long now?

150
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,635
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there.

151
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,387
There, by those trees.

152
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,430
There is nothing.

153
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,140
Well, keep going.

154
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,143
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

155
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,103
What?

156
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,064
The point where I stop
taking orders from you.

157
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,234
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

158
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,862
The primary concern is that we stop him.

159
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,613
You let him out.

160
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,366
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

161
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,368
I didn't let him out.

162
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,328
Hey Brackett come in please...

163
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,455
Hey Brackett come in please...

164
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:01,373
Who is it?

165
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,125
Geez, this is amsey.

166
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,543
Say again, what is it?

167
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:05,711
This is Ramsey.

168
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,129
Where are you?

169
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,842
I'm out by the bakery moving
north on the Scottsville road.

170
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,843
Get the hell back in the town.

171
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,803
Go up 17th street,
meet me by the bypass.

172
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,722
10 - 4 Ramsey clear.

173
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,224
Will you put that thing away!

174
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,520
You couldn't have shot him six times!

175
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,773
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

176
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,277
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

177
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,073
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

178
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,077
Is that him?

179
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,412
I don't know.

180
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,598
Get back!

181
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,250
Run! Come on, run!

182
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,293
Loomis!

183
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,419
Get back!

184
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,297
Get back you kids!
- Loomis!

185
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,174
- Stop!... Get out!
- Loomis!

186
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,759
Loomis!

187
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,885
Stop!

188
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,305
Stop!

189
00:18:58,889 --> 00:18:59,806
Don't shoot!

190
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,518
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

191
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,989
Oh, sheriff Brackett.

192
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,326
He came out of nowhere.

193
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,827
I couldn't stop.

194
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:21,954
Is it him?!

195
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,794
Is it him or not!?

196
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:36,844
Leigh...

197
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,430
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

198
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,724
Across the street from the Doyle house.

199
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,309
Three kids...

200
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,812
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

201
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:47,980
What?

202
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,367
Does it hurt a lot?

203
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,452
What?

204
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,950
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you.
Look, it'll be ok.

205
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,251
We'll play some games tonight and...

206
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,586
Repeating for those of you
who just tuned in.

207
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,588
Three people are dead tonight...

208
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,924
as a resolve an attack by
an escaped mental patient.

209
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,719
I understand we're going
to stay on the air now?

210
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,305
Repeating for those of
you who just tuned in.

211
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,307
Three people are dead tonight...

212
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,643
as a resolve an attack by
an escaped mental patient.

213
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:30,731
Any further details will be report coming
as soon as we get them.

214
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,774
This is Robert Munday...

215
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,526
reporting you live.

216
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,434
Hi...

217
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,603
Hi.

218
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:12,397
Jimmy...

219
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,901
Oh, how are you feeling?

220
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,403
Sore.

221
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,823
What happened?

222
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,158
Cracked the bone.

223
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,077
Lucky it wasn't a break.

224
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:29,164
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait
untill tomorrow, before he put cast on.

225
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,874
You have to get some rest.

226
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:33,961
Come on, Jimmy.

227
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,264
Can I get you something
to drink or anything?

228
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,558
How about a coke?

229
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,184
Ok.

230
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,894
Thanks.

231
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,004
Ok.

232
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:52,829
Come on!

233
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,399
- Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another
call came in. - Ok.

234
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,109
I'll get you that coke later.

235
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,861
Out.

236
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:05,868
Moments ago police reported that Michael
Myers, formerly of Haddonfield,

237
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,939
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren
county Sanitarium last night

238
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,040
...was believed to have burned to death.

239
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,827
Meanwhile,
three bodies were discovered

240
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:15,628
...in the upstairs bedroom of
the house directly behind me.

241
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,298
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families...

242
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:22,092
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

243
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,012
Talk to some kids. See if
anybody saw anything.

244
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,467
You need the parent's permission
to use a statement.

245
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:30,268
If you can't find the parents,
get a statement anyway.

246
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,562
Not now...

247
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,944
Give us a minute, fellas.

248
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:12,935
I... uh

249
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:19,775
have to... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

250
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,529
Go on home, Leigh.

251
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:26,031
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

252
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,112
- Damn you!
- I'm sorrry.

253
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,513
- What have you done?
- I haven't done anything.

254
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,014
YOU LET HIM OUT!

255
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,457
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

256
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,294
Now is there anything else,
that we can do for you?

257
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,465
If that wasn't Michael Myers
burning up in that car...

258
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,135
- then lot of other kids are gonna be
slaugtered tonight. - He's dead.

259
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,388
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

260
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:52,052
- It was him. - I wanna believe
you, but I gotta be sure.

261
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:54,853
I can't stop,
untill I'm certain it's dead.

262
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,524
- You talk about him like he's some
kind of animal. - He was my...

263
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:00,625
- Would you keep it back?
- He was my patient for fifteen years...

264
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,689
He became an obsession with me, until I
realized, that there was nothing within.

265
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:09,575
Neither consciance nor reason that was...
even remotely human.

266
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,038
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots
into him and he just got up and walked away.

267
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:19,793
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

268
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,462
Where'd they take the body?

269
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,006
The Coroner's office.

270
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,717
Get a dentist to meet me
there in half an hour.

271
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:43,233
Despite the fact that the man, who rescued
Laurie Strode, claims to have shot him
six times at close range.

272
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,778
Haddonfield police have no explanation
for the suspect's disappearance...

273
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,567
But say they're confident,
he will be captured soon.

274
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,868
- I cannot believe it. - Paramedics are now
removing the last of the bodies.

275
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:55,871
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for
apples. Actually bobbing for water. No less.

276
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,736
Well you gotta use water
to see if you don't...

277
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,837
I am never going to another halloween
party as long as I live.

278
00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:02,338
Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.

279
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,046
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

280
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,048
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

281
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,842
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

282
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,012
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

283
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:13,931
He's in Russelville.

284
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,661
It's five minutes to your house another
five minutes back to the hospital.

285
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,562
Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

286
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,064
You promised me.

287
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,443
I know I did.

288
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,343
One survivor...

289
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:55,190
17-year old Laurie Strode was found
directly across the street from the home

290
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:56,891
...where the murders took place.

291
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,654
The teenager was taken across town to
Haddonfield Memorial Clinic.

292
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:03,055
Paramedics on the scene...

293
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:25,591
In of aftermath of the killings
the streets between Chestnut

294
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:29,192
and tenth third jamed
with people and... cars.

295
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:30,817
Repeating...

296
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:36,031
that a... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
there are just jamed with both people...

297
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,408
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

298
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,579
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers...

299
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,666
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

300
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,505
The names of young victims
are not yet released, but...

301
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:51,506
people would probably recognized,
that is neighbourhood teenagers.

302
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,882
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

303
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,012
Now...

304
00:27:59,137 --> 00:27:59,930
back...

305
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,682
to Dementia...

306
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,880
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

307
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,138
Julie saw him you know.

308
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,348
Who?

309
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,434
Michael Myers.

310
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,727
Come on.

311
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,979
I swear. Yesterday, when
she was coming to work.

312
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,606
Where did she see him?

313
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,734
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

314
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,944
Well, she stopped at the light...

315
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,406
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

316
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:04,244
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

317
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,455
He didn't escape until last night.

318
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,501
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

319
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,794
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

320
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:16,173
Every other word you say
is either hell or shit or damn.

321
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:18,467
I'm sorry.

322
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,094
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

323
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:34,358
Hi.

324
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:38,362
Hey, you're here.

325
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:39,271
Hi.

326
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,030
You're late.

327
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,699
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward.

328
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:44,159
Hi. Jimmy.

329
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,161
Oh, hi. Karen.

330
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,334
Come on.

331
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,503
See you later.

332
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,462
Great.

333
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,969
Amazing grace...

334
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,847
come sit on my face

335
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,683
Don't make me cry...

336
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,685
I need your pie

337
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,770
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

338
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,856
What do you all worked up about?

339
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,190
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

340
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,693
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there.

341
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,611
All right, so what do you want me to do?

342
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,380
Look Jimmy...

343
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,199
Rule number one: never
get involved with a patient.

344
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:25,742
Nurses...

345
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,494
that's another story.

346
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,247
But patients is no good. It never works out.

347
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,458
Where you going college boy?

348
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,878
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

349
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,824
You were late again tonight.

350
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,662
Just fifteen minutes.

351
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:55,040
That could be the difference between
life and death for one of those kids.

352
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,837
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

353
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,713
You're a good nurse Karen.

354
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,714
I'd hate to loose you.

355
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,675
But you've got to learn to be on time.

356
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,385
Now. Let's get over this list.

357
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,429
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

358
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,115
Carr...

359
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,309
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

360
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,477
God, they should have...

361
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,604
They should have handled him more carefully.

362
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,523
Who?

363
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,526
Michael Myers.

364
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:26,154
Michael Myers?

365
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:28,298
Yea, he...

366
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,658
He was that guy, that was after you.

367
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,247
You mean the Myers house?

368
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,420
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

369
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,967
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

370
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,886
He escaped last night.

371
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,262
How do you know?

372
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,306
It's all over the radio.

373
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,600
Television too. It's on right now.

374
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:01,815
Why me?

375
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,986
I mean, why me?

376
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,115
Times up Jimmy.

377
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,117
Let's go.

378
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,285
OK. ok.

379
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:19,791
No you won't!

380
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,002
Visiting hours are definitely over.

381
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,592
Men... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

382
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,136
How's that shoulder feel?

383
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,180
A little better.

384
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,431
Good.

385
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,226
We've been trying to get
ahold of your parents.

386
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,239
Dr. Mixter told me, they were
at the same party he was...

387
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,440
but they're not there now
and they're not at home.

388
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,816
Do you have any idea of
where else they might be?

389
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:47,152
No.

390
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,905
I'll just keep trying.

391
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,750
Oh, this is just...

392
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,503
Janet?

393
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,007
Yes Mrs. Alves.

394
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,385
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having
trouble with the phones.

395
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,719
Right now.

396
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,514
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

397
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,100
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

398
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,604
What's wrong with the phones?

399
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,483
Nothing for you to worry about.

400
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,861
Just get some rest right now.

401
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,697
I'll let you know as soon as
we get ahold of your parents.

402
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,186
I'm gonna go check the phone.

403
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,897
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

404
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:08,901
- It'll take me five minutes. - But I don't
even know, how to use this thing!

405
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:12,709
I think somebody broke into the store room.
The lock was off.

406
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,465
Mr. Garrett?

407
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:20,968
I can't hear you.

408
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,306
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

409
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,606
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

410
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:35,774
Janet!

411
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,179
Mr. Garrett.

412
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,822
Mr. Garrett?

413
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,287
Mr. Garrett...
I gotta get back on the floor.

414
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,708
Hello?

415
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,268
It's difficult.

416
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,687
Even the gums are charred but...

417
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,021
...look here.

418
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:40,858
See here?

419
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,651
No fillings.

420
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:46,196
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

421
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,240
Michael Myers is 21.

422
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:51,869
Positive ID means
we check x-rays and dental records.

423
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,412
That'll take hours!

424
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,874
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

425
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,586
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

426
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,800
Everybody goes back out.

427
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,093
But we just closed it up.

428
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:11,346
I want to sweep from
Chestnut South to the bypass.

429
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,556
I want every street...

430
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,932
every house...

431
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,268
every backyard.

432
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:17,895
Ok.

433
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,438
You've got it.

434
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:25,194
Thank you.

435
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:36,743
All right, that's enough. That's enough!

436
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:41,544
Now come on, get out of here. You guys,
go home. Michael Myers not here.

437
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:55,974
- This is Hunt in another vehicle. The old
Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

438
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:59,394
One of their number was butchered,
this is a wake.

439
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,237
Heightens my sense of security.

440
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,502
All right. Knock it off!

441
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,839
Come on folks, go home.

442
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:29,341
Knock it off!

443
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:33,428
Empty.

444
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:36,515
Plus we've covered the whole
east end of town. There's nothing.

445
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,641
Check it again.

446
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,309
He just isn't here.

447
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:40,811
CHECK IT again!

448
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:43,772
You know.

449
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,067
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet
town before tonight.

450
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:48,277
The only a...

451
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,362
gunshot you ever heard

452
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:53,073
were start tracking for
the local highschool.

453
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:56,493
Yet one night
in 1963 Michael Myers...

454
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,330
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large...

455
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:01,874
butcher knife.

456
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,625
I remember.

457
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,628
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.

458
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,298
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

459
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,758
He came back.

460
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,219
After fifteen years?

461
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,264
He waited with extraordinary patience,

462
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,600
There was a...

463
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:22,561
force inside him biding its time.

464
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:27,691
The stuff grew accustomed
to his immobility and silence.

465
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:32,279
In many ways he was the ideal patient.
He didn't talked he didn't...

466
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,073
cry. He didn't even move.

467
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:36,909
He just waited.

468
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:40,078
The staff was unprepared they didn't...

469
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:42,664
know, what he was.

470
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,499
Did you know?

471
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,752
Yea I knew.

472
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:47,878
Excuse me.

473
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:49,421
Mr. Hunt?

474
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,601
- Yea. What is it Craig?
- Yea. I'm worried about Bennet Tramer.

475
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,802
- He isn't home yet.
- Yea. And he left the party at ten.

476
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,637
It's only a little after...

477
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:57,846
eleven boys.

478
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:59,389
He was real drunk.

479
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,599
How old is he?

480
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,017
Seventeen.

481
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,186
He had this stupid mask on.

482
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:05,812
All right boys.

483
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:07,564
Seventeen...

484
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,399
...and wearing a mask.

485
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:13,779
Oh god.
- We should check his dental records.

486
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,576
Old reservoir road. They had break-in
the elementary school.

487
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:19,577
- They're pretty sure it's him.
- Come on!

488
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,635
Oh, stop.

489
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:21,054
Aw, shit!

490
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:24,224
Shit. - Oh, you idiot!

491
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:25,934
You could've broken it.

492
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,520
I wish I had!

493
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,108
I also could have used these on you.

494
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,111
What an asshole.

495
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,487
Happy Halloween.

496
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:40,157
Budd...

497
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,618
you are the biggest jerk...

498
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,286
I've ever met.

499
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,124
But you love me.

500
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,502
Yeah...

501
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:53,962
I'm an idiot.

502
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,474
Let's go down to the therapy room.

503
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,936
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

504
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:12,189
I can't leave the kids right now.

505
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:14,316
Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?

506
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,485
All this Michael Myers crap.

507
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:18,737
I just...

508
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,366
I just want...

509
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:43,554
The therapy room's three doors down.

510
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:51,781
I suppose if we left the door open,
we could hear if somebody is coming...

511
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:53,982
or if the kids started to cry...

512
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,693
No. I... I got to check it out first.

513
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,486
Fifteen minutes.

514
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:03,657
If everything's ok.

515
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,201
You're wasting time.

516
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,631
Why don't you tell me?

517
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,801
Why don't you ever tell me anything?

518
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:24,678
I told you...

519
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,139
I'm NOT your mother.

520
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:03,777
It's hot.

521
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,390
It's hot in here.

522
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:36,476
It's just me.

523
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:52,618
I'm not kidding.

524
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,954
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

525
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:57,539
Why don't you go check?

526
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,001
It's cold out there.

527
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,796
It can get cold in here.

528
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,800
Gotcha.

529
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:25,794
Forget it, Budd.

530
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:27,462
I have to go back to work.

531
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,847
You wanna go for breakfast later?

532
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:41,602
No...

533
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,025
I'm sorry.

534
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:52,946
I just have to get back. That's all.

535
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,242
Now. Budd, don't be that way.

536
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,449
He got in here.

537
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,285
And look over here.

538
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:50,754
And here...

539
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,347
Sister.

540
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,475
Is that it?

541
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:04,643
No.

542
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,353
Here.

543
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:14,570
What's this?

544
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:16,488
It's gibberish.

545
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:17,489
No.

546
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,533
It's a celtic word.

547
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:21,535
Samhain...

548
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:24,663
It means the Lord of the dead.

549
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:26,915
The end of summer.

550
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,585
The festival...

551
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,336
of samhain.

552
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:33,714
October 31st.

553
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:36,925
Dr. Loomis?

554
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,926
Yes?

555
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:41,096
I have to talk to you.

556
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,600
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

557
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,269
What are you doing here?

558
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:48,979
Privately.

559
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,699
Thanks.

560
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:03,368
Dr. Loomis...

561
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,038
You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.

562
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:07,497
Ordered?

563
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,542
- He can't order me.
- No, no...

564
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,419
but the governor can.

565
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,797
- He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally
a few hours ago. - The Governor...

566
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:17,716
well, well...

567
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:20,761
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.

568
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:26,850
Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.
You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.

569
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:29,186
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

570
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,313
I know. I'm sorry.

571
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:36,401
Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could
jeapordize our whole rehabilitation program.

572
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:40,015
He doesn't want anyone from the mental
health department anywhere near Haddonfield.

573
00:54:40,016 --> 00:54:42,116
Why did he send you down here then?

574
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,702
In case you already found him.

575
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,121
- ... alive.
- Tell Dr. Rogers...

576
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:52,251
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him
anything. I can't leave Haddonfield now.

577
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,711
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

578
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:59,091
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

579
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:16,817
Laurie...

580
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:22,698
listen...

581
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,659
I know that...

582
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,661
you don't know me very well.

583
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,747
But I just wanna let you to know that...

584
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,543
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

585
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:35,919
Ok?

586
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:37,796
Promise.

587
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:44,595
Laurie.

588
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:54,146
Shit!

589
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,039
Dr. Mixter?!

590
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,668
Dr. Mixter.

591
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:23,383
Dr. Mixter!

592
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,735
Dr. Mixter?

593
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:47,574
Dr. Mixter...

594
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,243
It's an emergency!

595
00:56:57,668 --> 00:57:00,170
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

596
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,381
She's had a reaction to the medication.

597
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:04,466
You better come quick.

598
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,056
Dr. Mixter.

599
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,350
This is ridiculous.
I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

600
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,236
Mrs. Alves?

601
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:11,904
Laurie?

602
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,322
You ok?

603
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,094
We will find him.

604
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:43,180
Where're you gonna look?

605
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:45,098
I don't know.

606
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:47,768
Neither do I.

607
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,007
Mr. Garrett?

608
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:45,951
Mr. Garrett!?

609
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:13,896
Mr. Garrett?

610
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,066
Mr. Garrett?

611
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,028
Sorry.

612
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:22,863
Listen...

613
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,699
I can't find anybody.

614
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:27,618
Budd's gone...
Mrs. Alves is gone.

615
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,914
We gotta find Laurie.

616
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:33,415
All right, listen.

617
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,002
Why don't you check the East wing again?

618
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:38,212
All right?

619
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:40,717
And if you don't find anyone,
I want you to get into your car...

620
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:43,718
...and drive out to the sheriff's station.
Get somebody out of here.

621
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:45,844
All right?

622
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:48,847
Ok.

623
01:04:49,164 --> 01:04:50,006
Ok.

624
01:04:50,032 --> 01:04:51,099
I'll keep looking.

625
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:12,579
Hello?

626
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:47,114
Jesus.

627
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:33,697
Laurie!

628
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:38,702
Laurie.

629
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,370
Laurie wait!

630
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:45,209
Wait Laurie...

631
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:29,034
He didn't believe me and now they're dead.

632
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:31,537
I'm sorry.

633
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:33,163
Don't feel sorry for me.

634
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:35,791
Feel sorry for that little town back there.

635
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,168
It'll be years before they forget this.

636
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:43,131
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else
you should know.

637
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:46,593
You see the blackboard
back there in the Elementary school?

638
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,011
Yea?

639
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:50,264
In order to appease the gods,

640
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:54,351
the druid priests... held...
fire... rituals.

641
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:57,479
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane...

642
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:58,897
animals...

643
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:00,107
were...

644
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:02,526
burned alive

645
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,236
in baskets.

646
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:09,408
By observing the way they died, the druids
believed, they could see omens of the future.

647
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:14,246
2000 years later we've come no further.

648
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:17,291
Samhain isn't...

649
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:19,084
evil spirits.

650
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,838
It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.

651
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:26,884
it's the unconscious mind.

652
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:31,722
We're all afraid of the
dark inside ourselves.

653
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,143
Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.

654
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:38,730
There's a file on Michael Myers,
that nobody knew about.

655
01:14:38,731 --> 01:14:40,231
- I've seen everything.
- No.

656
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:44,568
No. It was hidden. Sealed by the court
after his parents were killed.

657
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:50,616
Now after the Governor heard what happened
tonight, he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

658
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:52,034
What file?

659
01:14:53,452 --> 01:14:54,745
It isn't fair.

660
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,372
They should've allowed you
to examine everything.

661
01:14:58,749 --> 01:14:59,791
That girl...

662
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:03,545
that Strode girl, that's
Michael Myers sister.

663
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,173
She was born...

664
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:08,091
2 years before he was commited.

665
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:12,054
Two years after... his parents died
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

666
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:16,252
They requested, that the records be sealed
in order to protect the family.

667
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:18,353
Jeez, don't you see,
what he's doing here in Haddonfield?

668
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:21,730
He killed one sister fifteen years ago.
Now he's trying to kill the other!

669
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,609
Tonight after I shot him,
where did they take her?

670
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:27,110
The clinic.

671
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:29,655
Clinic where? Do you know this area well?

672
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:30,864
A little bit.

673
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:34,409
- Where's the hospital located? - Dr. Loomis
we're under orders from the Governor!

674
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:36,620
It's back around Seventeen
about three miles.

675
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,413
Turn this car around now!

676
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,457
I can't do that. I've got orders.

677
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:43,502
Those orders have changed!
- Dr. Loomis!

678
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:45,838
Doctor, you're getting yourself
into a lot of trouble.

679
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:49,299
What is your fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

680
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:24,710
Jimmy?

681
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:35,262
It's all right.

682
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:37,431
We're...

683
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,850
Ok, we're gonna get out of here.

684
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:52,446
I think, I think...

685
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:52,130
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel, but I
have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.

686
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:53,382
Can I trust you?

687
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:55,717
What have I got to loose...

688
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,261
except my job?

689
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,180
I need help...

690
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:04,226
Help...

691
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:06,895
Help... me.

692
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,024
HELP ME!

693
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:21,118
Go and check all the rooms down there.

694
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:22,202
Go on!

695
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:24,580
Dr. Loomis.
- You stay with me and shut up.

696
01:18:58,197 --> 01:18:59,406
HELP!

697
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:03,118
HELP!

698
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:06,705
HELP!

699
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:08,957
HELP!

700
01:19:15,589 --> 01:19:16,715
HELP!

701
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,053
PLEASE!

702
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:22,888
PLEASE!

703
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:25,432
PLEASE!

704
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:30,020
Come on, get in!

705
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:05,639
Stop!

706
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:06,640
He is dead!

707
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:07,891
No, he's not. Look at him!

708
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:09,142
He's still breathing.

709
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:12,229
Ok.

710
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:17,359
There's a two way radio over in the
marshall's car. I want you to go outside.

711
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,403
Get on that radio and get help!

712
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:21,446
Now wait a minute.

713
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,907
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

714
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:24,950
Move!

715
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:30,539
I'm sorry I left you.

716
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:32,124
Are you all right?

717
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,379
Why won't he die?

718
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:41,633
Get away from him!

719
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:43,260
But he's stopped breathing!

720
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:44,303
No!

Michael STOP!

01:25:20,913 --> 01:25:23,248
Get out. get out. Go on.

Get out NOW!

It's time...
Michael.

734
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:57,759
What's the count?

735
01:26:57,926 --> 01:26:58,844
Ten.

736
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:00,762
So far.

737
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:12,326
- Do you have any firsthand information...
- Just leave me alone.

738
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:14,527
- about what happened inside the hospital?
- Excuse us.

739
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:18,238
Can't I ride in front?

740
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:20,157
No Laurie.
I'm sorry, I have to put you in back.

741
01:27:20,182 --> 01:27:20,966
Are you ready?

742
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:22,409
Watch out for your feet.

743
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:25,787
- She's now being assisted out of the
wheelchair... - Drop your feet carefull.

744
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:27,873
...and into the ambulance.

745
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,167
Big step.

746
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:31,543
Big step...

747
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:33,587
Ok.

748
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:36,548
Keep the leg up.
We'll have you out of here in a second.

749
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:41,053
Ok.
