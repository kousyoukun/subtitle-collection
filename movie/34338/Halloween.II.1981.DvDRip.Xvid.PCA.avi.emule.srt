1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to listen to me. I want you
to go out of the house...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
...and down the street
to the MacKenzies' house.

3
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,686
I want you to knock on their door.

4
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:04,939
I want you to tell them to call the police
and send'em over here.

5
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:06,315
All right?

6
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,234
Laurie. - Do as I say.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:11,279
Go.

8
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:34,635
Get help!

9
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:35,803
Come on!

10
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,263
Come on!

11
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:08,669
Oh, no.

12
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:19,680
Help!

13
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,673
It was the boogeyman.

14
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:00,596
As a matter of fact...

15
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:02,014
it was.

16
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:59,447
What's going on out here?

17
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:00,573
Call the police!

18
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,325
Tell the sheriff I shot him!

19
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,050
Who?

20
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:06,537
Tell him he's still on the loose!
- Is this some kind of joke?

21
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:09,123
I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight!

22
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,459
You don't know what death is!

23
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,629
Trick or treat.

24
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,238
I shot him six times!

25
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,366
What?
- I shot him six times!

26
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,452
I... I shot him in the heart and...

27
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:18,247
He cannot get a very far, come on.
- I shot him six times!

28
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,624
This guy...

29
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,460
he's not human!

30
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:48,319
Harold, you want mayonnaise
on your sandwich?

31
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,660
How about mustard?

32
00:07:56,702 --> 00:08:00,917
Up next some more spine melting madness
"Night of the Living Dead"

33
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,918
Are you asleep again?

34
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:16,347
This is a WWAR special bulletin...

35
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,837
Police in Haddonfield have just made the
grisly discovery of three bodies...

36
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,438
...in the upstairs bedrooms of this house.

37
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,940
It appears that the murders took
place some time early this evening.

38
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,610
Authorities have confirmed
that all three of the victims are teenagers.

39
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,404
Two girls and a boy.

40
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:35,369
Police are searching the entire area for
a middle patient, who escaped last night

41
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,370
...from the Smith's Grow
Warren county sanitorium.

42
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:41,205
He is now believed to be
at large in Haddonfield.

43
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,249
This is Robert Mundy... live.

44
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:53,092
They're coming to get you Barbara.

45
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:56,804
- You're ignorant.
- They're coming for you, Barbara.

46
00:08:57,305 --> 00:08:59,974
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

47
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,601
They're coming for you.

48
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:02,618
Look...

49
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,479
There comes one of them now.

50
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,814
She'll hear you.
Here he comes now.

51
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,524
I'm gettitng out of here.

52
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,547
Mrs. Elrod?!

53
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:34,384
Mr. Elrod?

54
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,262
Are you ok?

55
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:52,443
Hi.

56
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,279
There was someone screaming next door.

57
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:57,907
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

58
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,451
His wife's always picking on him.

59
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,788
He probably got angry and
decided to start beating her.

60
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,042
Ok, deal.

61
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,585
Are your folks home?

62
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:11,629
They are gone.

63
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:16,634
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Harden
County and my mother's decided to go along.

64
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,052
Didn't you hear?

65
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,470
Hear about what?

66
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:21,764
Some girl got killed in Haddonfield.

67
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,474
It's on the radio.

68
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,017
Hold on.

69
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:29,689
...and the police have
curtain off the entire area

70
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:30,523
to repeat...

71
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,369
Three teenagers have been
found murdered...

72
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,964
in the house in the Northwest
section of Haddonfield.

73
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:37,365
The names of the teenagers
have not been released...

74
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:38,466
I can't believe it.

75
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:39,323
I know.

76
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:41,617
- You know we probably knew her.
- Where did it happen?

77
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,244
Down on Orange Grove.

78
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:46,748
- That's right down the street.
- I know.

79
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:48,835
Police confirmed the girl
was rescued that she...

80
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:51,236
Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.

81
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,004
They said the guy got away.

82
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:55,048
- Do they know who it was?
- No.

83
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,009
Oh, god.

84
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,261
Alice?

85
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,637
Alice...

86
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:03,848
Talk...

87
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:05,266
- Haddonfield police is...
- Alice?

88
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:08,102
- ... all point bulets within description...
- Who is it?

89
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:11,439
- Alice? Where are you?
- ... the main streets in town.

90
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:14,344
- Who is it? - Chief to the Haddonfield
police department says...

91
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:16,945
He believe that suspect
will be apprehended...

92
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,613
...within a matter of hours.

93
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:21,244
Neighboor say they heard scream
during the early evening,

94
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:24,245
...but activity a noise
it's for usual haloween.

95
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,811
I came out on the lawn.
I asked him what was going on.

96
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,604
- He said...
- Inside you guys.

97
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,523
He said he'd shot somebody.

98
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:25,388
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

99
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:52,582
Laurie?

100
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:55,042
Can you hear me?
- Don't let them put me to sleep.

101
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:56,822
It's all right, take it easy.
We're gonna go to clinic, all right?

102
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,923
- Don't let them put me to sleep.
- It's ok.

103
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,265
Hey...

104
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,099
you know this chick?

105
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:13,644
Yeh, her name's Laurie Strode.

106
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,563
She goes to school with
my little brother Ziggy.

107
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:18,399
- Her old man... eh Strode Realty?
- Yeah.

108
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,609
Ook.

109
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,837
Ok, just get out easy.

110
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,130
It's gonna be ok.

111
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,216
Just walk real slow, ok?

112
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,260
Are you all right?
Are you all right, hon?

113
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:49,889
Oh, god.

114
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:53,012
Here. Just... just put it
up there real gently.

115
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:55,813
You ok? Let's go. Just walk
real slow. Come on.

116
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:57,024
Fill out this form.
Someone will be with you in a moment.

117
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:58,625
Well, we should see
the doctor right away.

118
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,377
He's with a patient.
Would you please wait in room "A"?

119
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:03,421
Come on honey. Thank you.

120
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:07,258
Where's Doc. Mixter?

121
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,302
He's been at the country club.
I think he's drunk.

122
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:10,636
Oh, great.

123
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:11,804
What've we got?

124
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:15,603
Stub wound, left anterior chest,
possibly penetrating. Multiple...

125
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,604
- It's Laurie Strode. - Come on, let's go
... fractured right ankle.

126
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,938
Janet, get me some more coffee.

127
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,565
Get that out of here.

128
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,903
Oh, Laurie.

129
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,488
Hi there.

130
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,741
Well let's see what we have here.

131
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,159
Ah yes...

132
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,244
you lost a lot of blood.

133
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:37,663
We'll need to a type it.

134
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,754
When was the last time
you had a tetatus shot?

135
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,506
I don't know.

136
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:53,888
Get me some...

137
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:56,516
- 3.0 nylon on...
- Cutting needle?

138
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,683
- Yes.
- Right away.

139
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:59,852
We're going to have to put her out.
- No!

140
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,605
No, don't put me to sleep.
- Ok, relax.

141
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,065
Nylon's not gonna hurt you.

142
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,316
No.

143
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,404
Please don't put me to sleep.

144
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:13,074
Take it easy.

145
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:19,539
Try to relax, Laurie.

146
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,252
Doctor Mixter have you
stitched up in no time.

147
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:26,504
Take it easy, Laurie.

148
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,675
Circle the block again.

149
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,386
How long now?

150
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,513
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there.

151
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,265
There, by those trees.

152
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,308
There is nothing.

153
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,018
Well, keep going.

154
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:44,021
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

155
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:44,981
What?

156
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,942
The point where I stop
taking orders from you.

157
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:51,112
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

158
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:53,740
The primary concern is that we stop him.

159
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,491
You let him out.

160
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,244
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

161
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,246
I didn't let him out.

162
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,206
Hey Brackett come in please...

163
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,333
Hey Brackett come in please...

164
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,251
Who is it?

165
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:07,003
Geez, this is amsey.

166
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,421
Say again, what is it?

167
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:09,589
This is Ramsey.

168
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,007
Where are you?

169
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm out by the bakery moving
north on the Scottsville road.

170
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:15,721
Get the hell back in the town.

171
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:18,681
Go up 17th street,
meet me by the bypass.

172
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,600
10 - 4 Ramsey clear.

173
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:23,102
Will you put that thing away!

174
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,398
You couldn't have shot him six times!

175
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:30,651
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

176
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:34,155
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

177
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:38,951
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

178
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:42,955
Is that him?

179
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,290
I don't know.

180
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:47,476
Get back!

181
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:49,128
Run! Come on, run!

182
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:50,171
Loomis!

183
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,297
Get back!

184
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,175
Get back you kids!
- Loomis!

185
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,052
- Stop!... Get out!
- Loomis!

186
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:57,637
Loomis!

187
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:58,763
Stop!

188
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:02,183
Stop!

189
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:03,684
Don't shoot!

190
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,396
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

191
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,867
Oh, sheriff Brackett.

192
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,204
He came out of nowhere.

193
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,705
I couldn't stop.

194
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:25,832
Is it him?!

195
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,672
Is it him or not!?

196
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:40,722
Leigh...

197
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,308
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

198
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,602
Across the street from the Doyle house.

199
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,187
Three kids...

200
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,690
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

201
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:51,858
What?

202
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,245
Does it hurt a lot?

203
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:06,330
What?

204
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:09,828
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you.
Look, it'll be ok.

205
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:12,129
We'll play some games tonight and...

206
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,464
Repeating for those of you
who just tuned in.

207
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,466
Three people are dead tonight...

208
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:19,802
as a resolve an attack by
an escaped mental patient.

209
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:22,597
I understand we're going
to stay on the air now?

210
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:25,183
Repeating for those of
you who just tuned in.

211
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,185
Three people are dead tonight...

212
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,521
as a resolve an attack by
an escaped mental patient.

213
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:34,609
Any further details will be report coming
as soon as we get them.

214
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:36,652
This is Robert Munday...

215
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,404
reporting you live.

216
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:11,312
Hi...

217
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,481
Hi.

218
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,275
Jimmy...

219
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:19,779
Oh, how are you feeling?

220
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:22,281
Sore.

221
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,701
What happened?

222
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,036
Cracked the bone.

223
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:28,955
Lucky it wasn't a break.

224
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,042
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait
untill tomorrow, before he put cast on.

225
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:34,752
You have to get some rest.

226
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:37,839
Come on, Jimmy.

227
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,142
Can I get you something
to drink or anything?

228
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:51,436
How about a coke?

229
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,062
Ok.

230
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:54,772
Thanks.

231
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:55,882
Ok.

232
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:56,707
Come on!

233
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,277
- Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another
call came in. - Ok.

234
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:00,987
I'll get you that coke later.

235
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:02,739
Out.

236
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:09,746
Moments ago police reported that Michael
Myers, formerly of Haddonfield,

237
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,817
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren
county Sanitarium last night

238
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,918
...was believed to have burned to death.

239
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:16,705
Meanwhile,
three bodies were discovered

240
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:19,506
...in the upstairs bedroom of
the house directly behind me.

241
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,176
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families...

242
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,970
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

243
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:28,890
Talk to some kids. See if
anybody saw anything.

244
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:31,345
You need the parent's permission
to use a statement.

245
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:34,146
If you can't find the parents,
get a statement anyway.

246
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:37,440
Not now...

247
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:44,822
Give us a minute, fellas.

248
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:16,813
I... uh

249
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:23,653
have to... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

250
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:27,407
Go on home, Leigh.

251
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:29,909
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

252
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:31,990
- Damn you!
- I'm sorrry.

253
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:34,391
- What have you done?
- I haven't done anything.

254
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:35,892
YOU LET HIM OUT!

255
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:39,335
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

256
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:43,172
Now is there anything else,
that we can do for you?

257
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:47,343
If that wasn't Michael Myers
burning up in that car...

258
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:51,013
- then lot of other kids are gonna be
slaugtered tonight. - He's dead.

259
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,266
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

260
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,930
- It was him. - I wanna believe
you, but I gotta be sure.

261
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,731
I can't stop,
untill I'm certain it's dead.

262
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:01,402
- You talk about him like he's some
kind of animal. - He was my...

263
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:04,503
- Would you keep it back?
- He was my patient for fifteen years...

264
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:08,567
He became an obsession with me, until I
realized, that there was nothing within.

265
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:13,453
Neither consciance nor reason that was...
even remotely human.

266
00:23:13,578 --> 00:23:18,916
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots
into him and he just got up and walked away.

267
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:23,671
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

268
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,340
Where'd they take the body?

269
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,884
The Coroner's office.

270
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,595
Get a dentist to meet me
there in half an hour.

271
00:23:41,814 --> 00:23:47,111
Despite the fact that the man, who rescued
Laurie Strode, claims to have shot him
six times at close range.

272
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:50,656
Haddonfield police have no explanation
for the suspect's disappearance...

273
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:53,445
But say they're confident,
he will be captured soon.

274
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,746
- I cannot believe it. - Paramedics are now
removing the last of the bodies.

275
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,749
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for
apples. Actually bobbing for water. No less.

276
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,614
Well you gotta use water
to see if you don't...

277
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:03,715
I am never going to another halloween
party as long as I live.

278
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:06,216
Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.

279
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:07,924
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

280
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,926
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

281
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,720
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

282
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:15,890
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

283
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:17,809
He's in Russelville.

284
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:21,539
It's five minutes to your house another
five minutes back to the hospital.

285
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,440
Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

286
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:25,942
You promised me.

287
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:30,321
I know I did.

288
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,221
One survivor...

289
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:59,068
17-year old Laurie Strode was found
directly across the street from the home

290
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,769
...where the murders took place.

291
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:04,532
The teenager was taken across town to
Haddonfield Memorial Clinic.

292
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,933
Paramedics on the scene...

293
00:26:26,104 --> 00:26:29,469
In of aftermath of the killings
the streets between Chestnut

294
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,070
and tenth third jamed
with people and... cars.

295
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:34,695
Repeating...

296
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:39,909
that a... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
there are just jamed with both people...

297
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,286
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

298
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:46,457
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers...

299
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,544
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

300
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:52,383
The names of young victims
are not yet released, but...

301
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:55,384
people would probably recognized,
that is neighbourhood teenagers.

302
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:57,760
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

303
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:02,890
Now...

304
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:03,808
back...

305
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,560
to Dementia...

306
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:36,758
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

307
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,016
Julie saw him you know.

308
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:47,226
Who?

309
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:49,312
Michael Myers.

310
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:50,605
Come on.

311
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:52,857
I swear. Yesterday, when
she was coming to work.

312
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,484
Where did she see him?

313
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:57,612
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

314
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:59,822
Well, she stopped at the light...

315
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:03,284
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

316
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:08,122
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

317
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:10,333
He didn't escape until last night.

318
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:14,379
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

319
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:16,672
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

320
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:20,051
Every other word you say
is either hell or shit or damn.

321
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,345
I'm sorry.

322
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,972
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

323
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:38,236
Hi.

324
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,240
Hey, you're here.

325
00:28:42,265 --> 00:28:43,149
Hi.

326
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:43,908
You're late.

327
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,577
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward.

328
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:48,037
Hi. Jimmy.

329
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,039
Oh, hi. Karen.

330
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:56,212
Come on.

331
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,381
See you later.

332
00:28:58,589 --> 00:28:59,340
Great.

333
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:05,847
Amazing grace...

334
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:08,725
come sit on my face

335
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,561
Don't make me cry...

336
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,563
I need your pie

337
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,648
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

338
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,734
What do you all worked up about?

339
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,068
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

340
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:21,571
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there.

341
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,489
All right, so what do you want me to do?

342
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,258
Look Jimmy...

343
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:28,077
Rule number one: never
get involved with a patient.

344
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:29,620
Nurses...

345
00:29:29,912 --> 00:29:31,372
that's another story.

346
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,125
But patients is no good. It never works out.

347
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:37,336
Where you going college boy?

348
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,756
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

349
00:30:49,992 --> 00:30:51,702
You were late again tonight.

350
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:55,540
Just fifteen minutes.

351
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:58,918
That could be the difference between
life and death for one of those kids.

352
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:03,715
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

353
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,591
You're a good nurse Karen.

354
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:06,592
I'd hate to loose you.

355
00:31:06,718 --> 00:31:08,553
But you've got to learn to be on time.

356
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:10,263
Now. Let's get over this list.

357
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:13,307
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

358
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:15,993
Carr...

359
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:18,187
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

360
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:19,355
God, they should have...

361
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,482
They should have handled him more carefully.

362
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:23,401
Who?

363
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:26,404
Michael Myers.

364
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:30,032
Michael Myers?

365
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:32,176
Yea, he...

366
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:33,536
He was that guy, that was after you.

367
00:31:37,498 --> 00:31:39,125
You mean the Myers house?

368
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:45,298
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

369
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,845
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

370
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,764
He escaped last night.

371
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,140
How do you know?

372
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:56,184
It's all over the radio.

373
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,478
Television too. It's on right now.

374
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:05,693
Why me?

375
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:09,864
I mean, why me?

376
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:13,993
Times up Jimmy.

377
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:15,995
Let's go.

378
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,163
OK. ok.

379
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:23,669
No you won't!

380
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,880
Visiting hours are definitely over.

381
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:32,470
Men... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

382
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:35,014
How's that shoulder feel?

383
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,058
A little better.

384
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:38,309
Good.

385
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,104
We've been trying to get
ahold of your parents.

386
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:44,117
Dr. Mixter told me, they were
at the same party he was...

387
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:46,318
but they're not there now
and they're not at home.

388
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:48,694
Do you have any idea of
where else they might be?

389
00:32:50,154 --> 00:32:51,030
No.

390
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,783
I'll just keep trying.

391
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:05,628
Oh, this is just...

392
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:08,381
Janet?

393
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:12,885
Yes Mrs. Alves.

394
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,263
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having
trouble with the phones.

395
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,597
Right now.

396
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:19,392
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

397
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:21,978
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

398
00:33:24,897 --> 00:33:26,482
What's wrong with the phones?

399
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,361
Nothing for you to worry about.

400
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,739
Just get some rest right now.

401
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,575
I'll let you know as soon as
we get ahold of your parents.

402
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:06,064
I'm gonna go check the phone.

403
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:08,775
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

404
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,779
- It'll take me five minutes. - But I don't
even know, how to use this thing!

405
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:16,587
I think somebody broke into the store room.
The lock was off.

406
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:22,343
Mr. Garrett?

407
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,846
I can't hear you.

408
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:30,184
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

409
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:38,484
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

410
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:39,652
Janet!

411
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:09,057
Mr. Garrett.

412
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,700
Mr. Garrett?

413
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:16,165
Mr. Garrett...
I gotta get back on the floor.

414
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:20,586
Hello?

415
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,146
It's difficult.

416
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:40,565
Even the gums are charred but...

417
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:41,899
...look here.

418
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:44,736
See here?

419
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,529
No fillings.

420
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,074
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

421
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:52,118
Michael Myers is 21.

422
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:55,747
Positive ID means
we check x-rays and dental records.

423
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,290
That'll take hours!

424
00:39:57,415 --> 00:40:00,752
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

425
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:04,464
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

426
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:10,678
Everybody goes back out.

427
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:11,971
But we just closed it up.

428
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:15,224
I want to sweep from
Chestnut South to the bypass.

429
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:16,434
I want every street...

430
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,810
every house...

431
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:20,146
every backyard.

432
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,773
Ok.

433
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:23,316
You've got it.

434
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:29,072
Thank you.

435
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:40,621
All right, that's enough. That's enough!

436
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:45,422
Now come on, get out of here. You guys,
go home. Michael Myers not here.

437
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,852
- This is Hunt in another vehicle. The old
Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

438
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,272
One of their number was butchered,
this is a wake.

439
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:12,115
Heightens my sense of security.

440
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,380
All right. Knock it off!

441
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:30,717
Come on folks, go home.

442
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:33,219
Knock it off!

443
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:37,306
Empty.

444
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:40,393
Plus we've covered the whole
east end of town. There's nothing.

445
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:41,519
Check it again.

446
00:41:41,644 --> 00:41:43,187
He just isn't here.

447
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:44,689
CHECK IT again!

448
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:47,650
You know.

449
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:50,945
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet
town before tonight.

450
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:52,155
The only a...

451
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,240
gunshot you ever heard

452
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,951
were start tracking for
the local highschool.

453
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,371
Yet one night
in 1963 Michael Myers...

454
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,208
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large...

455
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,752
butcher knife.

456
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:07,503
I remember.

457
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:10,506
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.

458
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:13,176
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

459
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:15,636
He came back.

460
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,097
After fifteen years?

461
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:21,142
He waited with extraordinary patience,

462
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:23,478
There was a...

463
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:26,439
force inside him biding its time.

464
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:31,569
The stuff grew accustomed
to his immobility and silence.

465
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,157
In many ways he was the ideal patient.
He didn't talked he didn't...

466
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:38,951
cry. He didn't even move.

467
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:40,787
He just waited.

468
00:42:41,412 --> 00:42:43,956
The staff was unprepared they didn't...

469
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,542
know, what he was.

470
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:48,377
Did you know?

471
00:42:49,337 --> 00:42:50,630
Yea I knew.

472
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:51,756
Excuse me.

473
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:53,299
Mr. Hunt?

474
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,479
- Yea. What is it Craig?
- Yea. I'm worried about Bennet Tramer.

475
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,680
- He isn't home yet.
- Yea. And he left the party at ten.

476
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:00,515
It's only a little after...

477
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,724
eleven boys.

478
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,267
He was real drunk.

479
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:04,477
How old is he?

480
00:43:04,602 --> 00:43:05,895
Seventeen.

481
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,064
He had this stupid mask on.

482
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,690
All right boys.

483
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:11,442
Seventeen...

484
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,277
...and wearing a mask.

485
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:17,657
Oh god.
- We should check his dental records.

486
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:21,454
Old reservoir road. They had break-in
the elementary school.

487
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:23,455
- They're pretty sure it's him.
- Come on!

488
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:22,513
Oh, stop.

489
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:24,932
Aw, shit!

490
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:28,102
Shit. - Oh, you idiot!

491
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:29,812
You could've broken it.

492
00:44:30,605 --> 00:44:32,398
I wish I had!

493
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:36,986
I also could have used these on you.

494
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:39,989
What an asshole.

495
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:41,365
Happy Halloween.

496
00:44:43,076 --> 00:44:44,035
Budd...

497
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:46,496
you are the biggest jerk...

498
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,164
I've ever met.

499
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,002
But you love me.

500
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:55,380
Yeah...

501
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:57,840
I'm an idiot.

502
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:09,352
Let's go down to the therapy room.

503
00:45:10,478 --> 00:45:12,814
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

504
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,067
I can't leave the kids right now.

505
00:45:16,192 --> 00:45:18,194
Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?

506
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:20,363
All this Michael Myers crap.

507
00:45:21,656 --> 00:45:22,615
I just...

508
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,244
I just want...

509
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:47,432
The therapy room's three doors down.

510
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:55,659
I suppose if we left the door open,
we could hear if somebody is coming...

511
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,860
or if the kids started to cry...

512
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:01,571
No. I... I got to check it out first.

513
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:03,364
Fifteen minutes.

514
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,535
If everything's ok.

515
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:10,079
You're wasting time.

516
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:23,509
Why don't you tell me?

517
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:26,679
Why don't you ever tell me anything?

518
00:46:27,263 --> 00:46:28,556
I told you...

519
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,017
I'm NOT your mother.

520
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:07,655
It's hot.

521
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:37,268
It's hot in here.

522
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,354
It's just me.

523
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:56,496
I'm not kidding.

524
00:48:57,872 --> 00:48:59,832
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

525
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:01,417
Why don't you go check?

526
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:04,879
It's cold out there.

527
00:49:06,506 --> 00:49:08,674
It can get cold in here.

528
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:12,678
Gotcha.

529
00:50:28,212 --> 00:50:29,672
Forget it, Budd.

530
00:50:29,922 --> 00:50:31,340
I have to go back to work.

531
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,725
You wanna go for breakfast later?

532
00:50:44,312 --> 00:50:45,480
No...

533
00:50:50,735 --> 00:50:51,903
I'm sorry.

534
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:56,824
I just have to get back. That's all.

535
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:01,120
Now. Budd, don't be that way.

536
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:41,327
He got in here.

537
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,163
And look over here.

538
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:54,632
And here...

539
00:52:03,057 --> 00:52:04,225
Sister.

540
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,353
Is that it?

541
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:08,521
No.

542
00:52:09,397 --> 00:52:10,231
Here.

543
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:18,448
What's this?

544
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:20,366
It's gibberish.

545
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:21,367
No.

546
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:23,411
It's a celtic word.

547
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,413
Samhain...

548
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,541
It means the Lord of the dead.

549
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,793
The end of summer.

550
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:33,463
The festival...

551
00:52:33,588 --> 00:52:35,214
of samhain.

552
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:37,592
October 31st.

553
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,803
Dr. Loomis?

554
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:41,804
Yes?

555
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,974
I have to talk to you.

556
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:48,478
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

557
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:51,147
What are you doing here?

558
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:52,857
Privately.

559
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:04,577
Thanks.

560
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,246
Dr. Loomis...

561
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:09,916
You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.

562
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,375
Ordered?

563
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14,420
- He can't order me.
- No, no...

564
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:16,297
but the governor can.

565
00:53:16,422 --> 00:53:19,675
- He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally
a few hours ago. - The Governor...

566
00:53:20,385 --> 00:53:21,594
well, well...

567
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:24,639
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.

568
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:30,728
Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.
You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.

569
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:33,064
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

570
00:53:33,398 --> 00:53:35,191
I know. I'm sorry.

571
00:53:36,317 --> 00:53:40,279
Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could
jeapordize our whole rehabilitation program.

572
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:43,893
He doesn't want anyone from the mental
health department anywhere near Haddonfield.

573
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:45,994
Why did he send you down here then?

574
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:49,580
In case you already found him.

575
00:53:49,914 --> 00:53:51,999
- ... alive.
- Tell Dr. Rogers...

576
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:56,129
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him
anything. I can't leave Haddonfield now.

577
00:53:56,546 --> 00:53:58,589
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

578
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:02,969
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

579
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:20,695
Laurie...

580
00:54:25,491 --> 00:54:26,576
listen...

581
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:29,537
I know that...

582
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:31,539
you don't know me very well.

583
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:34,625
But I just wanna let you to know that...

584
00:54:35,918 --> 00:54:38,421
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

585
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:39,797
Ok?

586
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:41,674
Promise.

587
00:54:47,346 --> 00:54:48,473
Laurie.

588
00:54:56,814 --> 00:54:58,024
Shit!

589
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:15,917
Dr. Mixter?!

590
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:20,546
Dr. Mixter.

591
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,261
Dr. Mixter!

592
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:45,613
Dr. Mixter?

593
00:55:50,243 --> 00:55:51,452
Dr. Mixter...

594
00:55:51,577 --> 00:55:53,121
It's an emergency!

595
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:04,048
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

596
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,259
She's had a reaction to the medication.

597
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:08,344
You better come quick.

598
00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:14,934
Dr. Mixter.

599
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:59,228
This is ridiculous.
I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

600
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:10,114
Mrs. Alves?

601
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:15,782
Laurie?

602
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,200
You ok?

603
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:44,972
We will find him.

604
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:47,058
Where're you gonna look?

605
01:01:47,683 --> 01:01:48,976
I don't know.

606
01:01:50,436 --> 01:01:51,646
Neither do I.

607
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,885
Mr. Garrett?

608
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:49,829
Mr. Garrett!?

609
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,774
Mr. Garrett?

610
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:21,944
Mr. Garrett?

611
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:24,906
Sorry.

612
01:03:25,948 --> 01:03:26,741
Listen...

613
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,577
I can't find anybody.

614
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:31,496
Budd's gone...
Mrs. Alves is gone.

615
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:35,792
We gotta find Laurie.

616
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:37,293
All right, listen.

617
01:03:38,878 --> 01:03:40,880
Why don't you check the East wing again?

618
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,090
All right?

619
01:03:42,507 --> 01:03:44,595
And if you don't find anyone,
I want you to get into your car...

620
01:03:44,596 --> 01:03:47,596
...and drive out to the sheriff's station.
Get somebody out of here.

621
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,722
All right?

622
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:52,725
Ok.

623
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:53,884
Ok.

624
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,977
I'll keep looking.

625
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,457
Hello?

626
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:50,992
Jesus.

627
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:37,575
Laurie!

628
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:42,580
Laurie.

629
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,248
Laurie wait!

630
01:07:47,752 --> 01:07:49,087
Wait Laurie...

631
01:12:31,035 --> 01:12:32,912
He didn't believe me and now they're dead.

632
01:12:33,996 --> 01:12:35,415
I'm sorry.

633
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:37,041
Don't feel sorry for me.

634
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,669
Feel sorry for that little town back there.

635
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:42,046
It'll be years before they forget this.

636
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:47,009
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else
you should know.

637
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:50,471
You see the blackboard
back there in the Elementary school?

638
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:51,889
Yea?

639
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:54,142
In order to appease the gods,

640
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:58,229
the druid priests... held...
fire... rituals.

641
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,357
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane...

642
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:02,775
animals...

643
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:03,985
were...

644
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:06,404
burned alive

645
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:08,114
in baskets.

646
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:13,286
By observing the way they died, the druids
believed, they could see omens of the future.

647
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:18,124
2000 years later we've come no further.

648
01:13:19,751 --> 01:13:21,169
Samhain isn't...

649
01:13:21,294 --> 01:13:22,962
evil spirits.

650
01:13:24,088 --> 01:13:26,716
It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.

651
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,762
it's the unconscious mind.

652
01:13:32,138 --> 01:13:35,600
We're all afraid of the
dark inside ourselves.

653
01:13:37,727 --> 01:13:40,021
Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.

654
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:42,608
There's a file on Michael Myers,
that nobody knew about.

655
01:13:42,609 --> 01:13:44,109
- I've seen everything.
- No.

656
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:48,446
No. It was hidden. Sealed by the court
after his parents were killed.

657
01:13:49,197 --> 01:13:54,494
Now after the Governor heard what happened
tonight, he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

658
01:13:54,619 --> 01:13:55,912
What file?

659
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:58,623
It isn't fair.

660
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:01,250
They should've allowed you
to examine everything.

661
01:14:02,627 --> 01:14:03,669
That girl...

662
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:07,423
that Strode girl, that's
Michael Myers sister.

663
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,051
She was born...

664
01:14:10,176 --> 01:14:11,969
2 years before he was commited.

665
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,932
Two years after... his parents died
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

666
01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:20,130
They requested, that the records be sealed
in order to protect the family.

667
01:14:20,131 --> 01:14:22,231
Jeez, don't you see,
what he's doing here in Haddonfield?

668
01:14:22,355 --> 01:14:25,608
He killed one sister fifteen years ago.
Now he's trying to kill the other!

669
01:14:26,818 --> 01:14:29,487
Tonight after I shot him,
where did they take her?

670
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:30,988
The clinic.

671
01:14:31,197 --> 01:14:33,533
Clinic where? Do you know this area well?

672
01:14:33,866 --> 01:14:34,742
A little bit.

673
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:38,287
- Where's the hospital located? - Dr. Loomis
we're under orders from the Governor!

674
01:14:38,413 --> 01:14:40,498
It's back around Seventeen
about three miles.

675
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:42,291
Turn this car around now!

676
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:44,335
I can't do that. I've got orders.

677
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,380
Those orders have changed!
- Dr. Loomis!

678
01:14:47,505 --> 01:14:49,716
Doctor, you're getting yourself
into a lot of trouble.

679
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:53,177
What is your fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

680
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:28,588
Jimmy?

681
01:15:38,222 --> 01:15:39,140
It's all right.

682
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:41,309
We're...

683
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:43,728
Ok, we're gonna get out of here.

684
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:56,324
I think, I think...

685
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:56,008
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel, but I
have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.

686
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:57,260
Can I trust you?

687
01:16:58,302 --> 01:16:59,595
What have I got to loose...

688
01:16:59,721 --> 01:17:01,139
except my job?

689
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:04,058
I need help...

690
01:17:06,936 --> 01:17:08,104
Help...

691
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,773
Help... me.

692
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:14,902
HELP ME!

693
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,996
Go and check all the rooms down there.

694
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:26,080
Go on!

695
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:28,458
Dr. Loomis.
- You stay with me and shut up.

696
01:18:02,075 --> 01:18:03,284
HELP!

697
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,996
HELP!

698
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:10,583
HELP!

699
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:12,835
HELP!

700
01:18:19,467 --> 01:18:20,593
HELP!

701
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:24,931
PLEASE!

702
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:26,766
PLEASE!

703
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:29,310
PLEASE!

704
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:33,898
Come on, get in!

705
01:19:08,599 --> 01:19:09,517
Stop!

706
01:19:09,809 --> 01:19:10,518
He is dead!

707
01:19:10,643 --> 01:19:11,769
No, he's not. Look at him!

708
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:13,020
He's still breathing.

709
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:16,107
Ok.

710
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:21,237
There's a two way radio over in the
marshall's car. I want you to go outside.

711
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:23,281
Get on that radio and get help!

712
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:25,324
Now wait a minute.

713
01:19:25,658 --> 01:19:27,785
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

714
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:28,828
Move!

715
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,417
I'm sorry I left you.

716
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:36,002
Are you all right?

717
01:19:40,048 --> 01:19:41,257
Why won't he die?

718
01:19:44,135 --> 01:19:45,511
Get away from him!

719
01:19:45,636 --> 01:19:47,138
But he's stopped breathing!

720
01:19:47,263 --> 01:19:48,181
No!

721
01:20:54,872 --> 01:20:56,499
Unit calling. Identify.

722
01:20:56,624 --> 01:21:00,294
Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis
at the clinic. He's here.

723
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,172
10-4. Unit calling. Indentify suspect.

724
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:06,509
Michael Myers! Just get your ass over here!

725
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:38,666
Take that gun. Come on!
- No.

726
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:39,959
Take it.

727
01:21:40,793 --> 01:21:41,794
Take it!

728
01:22:34,097 --> 01:22:35,223
Michael?!

729
01:22:51,823 --> 01:22:53,074
Michael STOP!

730
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:27,126
Get out. get out. Go on.

731
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:28,836
Go on. Get out.

732
01:24:30,338 --> 01:24:31,464
Get out NOW!

733
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,557
It's time...
Michael.

734
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:01,637
What's the count?

735
01:26:01,804 --> 01:26:02,722
Ten.

736
01:26:03,431 --> 01:26:04,640
So far.

737
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,204
- Do you have any firsthand information...
- Just leave me alone.

738
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:18,405
- about what happened inside the hospital?
- Excuse us.

739
01:26:21,115 --> 01:26:22,116
Can't I ride in front?

740
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:24,035
No Laurie.
I'm sorry, I have to put you in back.

741
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:24,844
Are you ready?

742
01:26:24,869 --> 01:26:26,287
Watch out for your feet.

743
01:26:26,871 --> 01:26:29,665
- She's now being assisted out of the
wheelchair... - Drop your feet carefull.

744
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:31,751
...and into the ambulance.

745
01:26:32,794 --> 01:26:34,045
Big step.

746
01:26:34,545 --> 01:26:35,421
Big step...

747
01:26:36,547 --> 01:26:37,465
Ok.

748
01:26:38,424 --> 01:26:40,426
Keep the leg up.
We'll have you out of here in a second.

749
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:44,931
Ok.
