{31792}{31913}who fled the Smith's Grove Warren county Sanitarium|last night was believed to have burned to death.
{31917}{32023}Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered|in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.
{32026}{32111}Identification of the victims is being witheld.|Pending notification of their families ...
{32114}{32178}Forget that. forget that.|I wanna concentrate on that house.
{32181}{32248}Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.
{32252}{32374}You need the parent's permission to use a statement.|If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.
{32426}{32453}Not now ...
{32601}{32630}Give us a minute, fellas.
{33374}{33397}I .. uh
{33428}{33561}have to ... go and tell my wife,|before somebody else does.
{33611}{33651}Go on home, Leigh.
{33654}{33711}Go on home, I'll take care of everything.
{33718}{33852}Damn you! - I'm sorrry. -What have you done?|- I haven't done anything. - YOU LET HIM OUT!
{33855}{33937}I didn't let him out.|I gave orders for him to be restrained.
{33962}{34029}Now is there anything else, that we can do for you?
{34035}{34129}If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car ...
{34132}{34217}then lot of other kids are gonna be slaugtered tonight.|- He's dead. 
{34220}{34271}I saw him.|- You saw man at the mask.
{34274}{34402}It was him. - I wanna believe you,|but I gotta be sure.|I can't stop, untill I'm certain it's dead.
{34406}{34550}You talk about him like he's some kind of animal.|- He was my ... - Would you keep it back?!|He was my patient for fifteen years ...
{34553}{34693}He became an obsession with me, until I realized,|that there was nothing within.|Neither consciance nor reason that was ...
{34696}{34755}even remotely human.
{34758}{34886}An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him|and he just got up and walked away.
{34889}{35000}I am talking about the real possibility,|that he is STILL OUT THERE!
{35030}{35064}Where'd they take the body?
{35070}{35101}The Coroner's office.
{35104}{35166}Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.
{35435}{35562}{y:i}Despite the fact that the man, who rescued Laurie Strode,|{y:i}claims to have shot him six times at close range.
{35565}{35647}{y:i}Haddonfield police have no explanation|{y:i}for the suspect's disappearance ...
{35650}{35769}{y:i}But say they're confident, he will be captured soon.|- I cannot believe it.|{y:i}Paramedics are now removing the last of the bodies.
{35772}{35865}Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for apples.|Actually bobbing for water. No less.
{35868}{36020}Well you gotta use water to see if you don't ...|- I am never going to another halloween party|as long as I live. Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.
{36023}{36061}And of course now I'm gonna be late.
{36064}{36109}Oh, you gotta drive me home first.
{36114}{36176}Oh Darcy, I don't have time.|- You've got to.
{36207}{36252}Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?
{36257}{36298}He's in Russelville.
{36319}{36433}It's five minutes to your house another five minutes|back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.
{36464}{36493}You promised me.
{36554}{36598}I know I did.
{37157}{37195}{y:i}One survivor ...
{37198}{37328}{y:i}17- year  old Laurie Strode was found directly across|{y:i}the street from the home, where the murders took place.
{37331}{37459}{y:i}The teenager was taken across town to|{y:i}Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Paramedics on the scene ...
{39374}{39541}{y:i}In of aftermath of the killings the streets between|{y:i}Chestnut and tenth third jamed with people and ... cars.
{39560}{39580}{y:i}Repeating ... 
{39583}{39705}{y:i}that a ... These streets a Chestnut and tenth|{y:i}there are just jamed with both people ...
{39708}{39762}Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.
{39783}{39862}Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers ...
{39893}{39936}But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.
{39950}{40076}{y:i}The names of young victims are not yet released,|{y:i}but people would probably recognized,|{y:i}that is neighbourhood teenagers.
{40079}{40133}Looks like a goddamn homecoming.
{40237}{40256}{y:i}Now ...
{40259}{40278}{y:i}back ...
{40281}{40320}{y:i}to Dementia ...

{41329}{41369}Michael Myers.
{41372}{41400}Come on.
{41404}{41454}I swear. Yesterday, when she was coming to work.
{41461}{41493}Where did she see him?
{41519}{41568}Near the shop and bag out by the mall.
{41586}{41621}Well, she stopped at the light ... 
{41625}{41704}and saw him walk in that field|behind the Lost River Dive in.
{41743}{41820}Julie said he was so creepy.|- Julie's full of shit.
{41827}{41873}He didn't escape until last night.
{41933}{41970}Well you don't have to swear, Budd.
{41973}{42025}She's a goddamn moron anyway.
{42033}{42106}Every other word you say is either hell or shit or damn.
{42135}{42161}I'm sorry. 
{42176}{42224}I guess I just fuck up all the time.
{42522}{42542}Hi.

{43457}{43489}What do you all worked up about?
{43492}{43521}Look it could be Ziggy, you know?
{43524}{43581}It could've been your brother Mark,|we pulled out of there. 
{43584}{43627}All right, so what do you want me to do?
{43651}{43667}Look Jimmy ...
{43670}{43737}Rule number one: never get involved with a patient.
{43752}{43774}Nurses ...
{43781}{43816}that's another story.
{43819}{43882}But patients is no good. It never works out.

{43968}{44017}I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.
{45701}{45742}You were late again tonight.
{45798}{45834}Just fifteen minutes.
{45837}{45915}That could be the difference|between life and death for one of those kids.
{45952}{46030}You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.|- I don't wanna hear any excuses.
{46036}{46075}You're a good nurse Karen.
{46079}{46099}I'd hate to loose you.
{46102}{46146}But you've got to learn to be on time.
{46152}{46187}Now. Let's get over this list.
{46196}{46260}I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.|- Ok..
{46310}{46322}Carr ... 
{46325}{46377}Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.
{46380}{46405}God, they should have ...
{46408}{46456}They should have handled him more carefully.
{46482}{46502}Who?
{46541}{46574}Michael Myers.
{46627}{46661}Michael Myers?
{46696}{46710}Yea, he ... 
{46713}{46745}He was that guy, that was after you.
{46840}{46879}You mean the Myers house?
{46960}{47027}That little kid who killed his sister?|- Yea.
{47116}{47160}But he's in a hospital somewhere.
{47163}{47206}He escaped last night.
{47213}{47239}How do you know?
{47253}{47288}It's all over the radio.
{47291}{47343}Television too. It's on right now.
{47486}{47516}Why me?
{47576}{47616}I mean, why me?
{47680}{47715}Times up Jimmy.
{47735}{47763}Let's go.
{47767}{47791}OK. ok.
{47915}{47947}No you won't!
{47950}{48000}Visiting hours are definitely over.
{48091}{48158}Men ... you can't live with'em,|you can't live without'em.
{48178}{48219}How's that shoulder feel?
{48242}{48268}A little better.
{48274}{48298}Good.
{48312}{48365}We've been trying to get ahold of your parents.
{48384}{48490}Dr. Mixter told me, they were at the same party he was,|but they're not there now and they're not at home.
{48498}{48547}Do you have any idea of where else they might be?
{48582}{48603}No.
{48632}{48669}I'll just keep trying.
{48927}{48953}Oh, this is just ...
{48993}{49019}Janet?
{49099}{49127}Yes Mrs. Alves.
{49130}{49184}Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having trouble with the phones.
{49187}{49216}Right now.
{49231}{49283}He's at the other end of the hall.|- Janet.
{49309}{49345}Yes, Mrs. Alves.
{49415}{49453}What's wrong with the phones?
{49501}{49546}Nothing for you to worry about.
{49561}{49603}Just get some rest right now.
{49610}{49671}I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.
{50366}{50402}I'm gonna go check the phone.
{50405}{50467}You wait here and I'll call you.|- I have to get back on the floor!
{50470}{50563}It'll take me five minutes.|- But I don't even know, how to use this thing!
{54873}{54970}I think somebody broke into the store room.|{y:i}The lock was off.
{55078}{55108}Mr. Garrett?
{55131}{55168}I can't hear you.
{55214}{55296}One of you had better drive down|to the sherif's station right away.
{55437}{55495}Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?
{55498}{55523}Janet!
{56193}{56228}Mr. Garrett.
{57652}{57682}Mr. Garrett?
{57765}{57837}Mr. Garrett ... I gotta get back on the floor.
{57918}{57943}Hello?
{58332}{58364}It's difficult.
{58369}{58422}Even the gums are charred but ... 
{58429}{58454}... look here.
{58496}{58522}See here?
{58532}{58565}No fillings.
{58571}{58650}He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.
{58657}{58699}Michael Myers is 21.
{58714}{58786}Positive ID means we check x-rays and dental records.
{58789}{58823}That'll take hours!
{58826}{58906}No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.|- We haven't got hours.
{58909}{58995}Listen to me. We've got to assume,|that Michael Myers is still alive.
{59109}{59144}Everybody goes back out.
{59147}{59175}But we just closed it up.
{59178}{59253}I want to sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass.
{59256}{59282}I want every street ...
{59285}{59315}every house ...
{59331}{59371}every backyard.
{59385}{59410}Ok.
{59418}{59447}You've got it.
{59563}{59585}Thank you.
{59814}{59977}All right, that's enough. That's enough!|Now come on, get out of here. You guys, go home.|Michael Myers not here.
{60199}{60323}This is Hunt in another vehicle.|The old Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.
{60336}{60405}One of their number was butchered, this is a wake.
{60560}{60617}Heightens my sense of security.
{60940}{60983}All right. Knock it off!
{61010}{61063}Come on folks, go home.
{61092}{61123}Knock it off!!!
{61200}{61221}Empty.
{61224}{61295}Plus we've covered the whole east end of town.|There's nothing.
{61298}{61322}Check it again.
{61325}{61362}He just isn't here. 
{61365}{61398}CHECK IT again!
{61449}{61469}You know.
{61485}{61548}Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.
{61554}{61577}The only a ...
{61580}{61627}gunshot you ever heard 
{61639}{61692}were start tracking for the local highschool.
{61698}{61774}Yet one night in 1963 Michael Myers ... 
{61785}{61866}did murder his sister|in that upstairs bedroom with a large ... 
{61870}{61903}butcher knife.
{61917}{61945}I remember.
{61951}{62017}On halloween.|- I was sixteen years old.
{62029}{62081}It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.
{62110}{62140}He came back.
{62154}{62199}After fifteen years?
{62206}{62272}He waited with extraordinary patience,
{62305}{62328}There was a ... 
{62331}{62399}force inside him biding its time. 
{62420}{62522}The stuff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence.
{62540}{62632}In many ways he was the ideal patient.|He didn't talked he didn't ... 
{62641}{62699}cry. He didn't even move.
{62707}{62743}He just waited. 
{62758}{62819}The staff was unprepared they didn't ... 
{62831}{62881}know, what he was.
{62895}{62925}Did you know?
{62948}{62979}Yea I knew.
{62982}{63006}Excuse me.
{63021}{63043}Mr. Hunt?
{63064}{63172}Yea. What is it Craig? - Yea. I'm worried about|Bennet Tramer. - He isn't home yet.|- Yea. And he left the party at ten.
{63175}{63216}It's only a little after ... 
{63219}{63245}eleven boys.
{63248}{63282}He was real drunk.
{63288}{63311}How old is he?
{63314}{63345}Seventeen.
{63348}{63397}He had this stupid mask on.
{63407}{63436}All right boys.
{63456}{63478}Seventeen ...
{63481}{63522}... and wearing a mask.
{63555}{63627}Oh god.|- We should check his dental records.
{63665}{63766}Old reservoir road. They had break-in the|elementary school. They're pretty sure it's him. - Come on!
{65154}{65182}Oh, stop.
{65198}{65240}Aw, shit!
{65254}{65316}Shit. - Oh, you idiot!
{65324}{65357}You could've broken it.
{65376}{65419}I wish I had!
{65466}{65529}I also could have used these on you.
{65569}{65601}What an asshole.
{65604}{65634}Happy Halloween.
{65675}{65698}Budd ...
{65705}{65757}you are the biggest jerk ... 
{65760}{65797}I've ever met.
{65883}{65913}But you love me.
{65940}{65970}Yeah ...
{65995}{66029}I'm an idiot.
{66244}{66305}Let's go down to the therapy room.
{66332}{66388}Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.
{66415}{66466}I can't leave the kids right now.
{66469}{66517}Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?
{66522}{66569}All this Michael Myers crap.
{66600}{66623}I just ...
{66684}{66710}I just want ...
{67172}{67218}The therapy room's three doors down.
{67328}{67468}I suppose if we left the door open, we could hear if|somebody is coming ... or if the kids started to cry ...
{67489}{67557}No. I ... I got to check it out first.
{67573}{67600}Fifteen minutes.
{67656}{67700}If everything's ok.
{67728}{67761}You're wasting time.
{68045}{68083}{y:i}Why don't you tell me?
{68104}{68159}{y:i}Why don't you ever tell me anything?
{68173}{68204}I told you ...
{68222}{68263}I'm NOT your mother.
{70560}{70580}It's hot.
{71255}{71290}It's hot in here.
{71338}{71364}It's just me.
{71716}{71751}I'm not kidding. 
{71784}{71831}It's too hot in here now, Budd.
{71838}{71869}Why don't you go check?
{71921}{71952}It's cold out there.
{71991}{72043}It can get cold in here.
{72117}{72139}Gotcha.
{73950}{73985}Forget it, Budd.
{73991}{74025}I have to go back to work.
{74200}{74250}You wanna go for breakfast later?
{74336}{74364}No ...
{74490}{74518}I'm sorry.
{74586}{74636}I just have to get back. That's all.
{74687}{74739}Now. Budd, don't be that way.
{75669}{75703}He got in here.
{75740}{75771}And look over here.
{75987}{76022}And here ...
{76224}{76252}Sister.
{76302}{76327}Is that it?
{76334}{76355}No.
{76376}{76396}Here.
{76566}{76593}What's this?
{76602}{76639}It's gibberish.
{76642}{76663}No.
{76675}{76712}It's a celtic word.
{76735}{76760}Samhain ...
{76788}{76835}It means the Lord of the dead.
{76858}{76889}The end of summer.
{76923}{76953}The festival ...
{76956}{76995}of samhain.
{77013}{77052}October 31st.
{77098}{77129}Dr. Loomis?
{77132}{77153}Yes?
{77180}{77229}I have to talk to you.
{77273}{77313}Oh, I didn't recognize you. 
{77342}{77377}What are you doing here?
{77387}{77418}Privately.
{77676}{77699}Thanks.
{77736}{77763}Dr. Loomis ...
{77770}{77827}You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.
{77837}{77862}Ordered?
{77872}{77935}He can't order me.|- No, no ...
{77943}{77980}but the governor can.
{77983}{78061}He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.|- The Governor ...
{78078}{78107}well, well ...
{78110}{78180}Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.
{78191}{78326}Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.|You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.
{78329}{78382}Someone should have listened to me earlier.
{78390}{78433}I know. I'm sorry.
{78460}{78555}Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could jeapordize|our whole rehabilitation program.
{78558}{78692}He doesn't want anyone from the mental|health department anywhere near Haddonfield.|- Why did he send you down here then?
{78734}{78778}In case you already found him.
{78786}{78836}... alive.|- Tell Dr. Rogers ...
{78839}{78935}Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.|I can't leave Haddonfield now.
{78945}{78994}I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
{79027}{79099}There's a marshal waiting for you outside.
{79497}{79524}Laurie ...
{79639}{79665}listen ...
{79706}{79736}I know that ... 
{79742}{79784}you don't know me very well.

{81703}{81740}It's an emergency!
{81942}{82002}Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.
{82009}{82055}She's had a reaction to the medication.
{82067}{82105}You better come quick.
{82229}{82263}Dr. Mixter.
{83270}{83325}This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.
{83552}{83586}Mrs. Alves?
{86576}{86599}Laurie?
{86604}{86633}You ok?
{90146}{90176}We will find him.
{90193}{90226}Where're you gonna look?
{90241}{90272}I don't know.
{90307}{90336}Neither do I.
{91050}{91085}Mr. Garrett?
{91681}{91731}Mr. Garrett!?
{92364}{92401}Mr. Garrett?
{92462}{92501}Mr. Garrett?
{92550}{92572}Sorry.
{92597}{92616}Listen ...
{92645}{92684}I can't find anybody.
{92701}{92730}Budd's gone ...|Mrs. Alves is gone.
{92796}{92833}We gotta find Laurie.
{92843}{92869}All right, listen.
{92907}{92955}Why don't you check the East wing again?
{92961}{92984}All right?
{92994}{93116}And if you don't find anyone, I want you to|get into your car and drive out to the sheriff's station.|Get somebody out of here.
{93148}{93167}All right?
{93218}{93239}Ok.
{93249}{93262}Ok.
{93265}{93293}I'll keep looking.
{93786}{93808}Hello?
{94609}{94636}Jesus.
{98605}{98630}Laurie!
{98729}{98750}Laurie.
{98761}{98790}Laurie wait!
{98874}{98906}Wait Laurie ...
{105666}{105711}He didn't believe me and now they're dead.
{105737}{105771}I'm sorry.
{105777}{105810}Don't feel sorry for me.
{105823}{105873}Feel sorry for that little town back there.
{105885}{105930}It'll be years before they forget this.
{105982}{106049}Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else|you should know.
{106065}{106132}You see the blackboard|back there in the Elementary school?
{106139}{106166}Yea?
{106181}{106220}In order to appease the gods,
{106223}{106318}the druid priests ... held ... fire ... rituals.
{106324}{106393}Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane ...
{106396}{106427}animals ...
{106433}{106456}were ...
{106482}{106514}burned alive
{106517}{106555}in baskets.
{106568}{106679}By observing the way they died, the druids believed,|they could see omens of the future.
{106722}{106795}2000 years later we've come no further.
{106834}{106868}Samhain isn't ... 
{106871}{106911}evil spirits.
{106938}{107001}It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.
{107037}{107098}it's the unconscious mind.
{107131}{107214}We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.
{107265}{107320}Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.
{107323}{107418}There's a file on Michael Myers, that nobody knew about.|- I've seen everything. - No.
{107421}{107522}No. It was hidden.|Sealed by the court after his parents were killed.
{107540}{107667}Now after the Governor heard what happened tonight,|he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.
{107670}{107701}What file?
{107735}{107766}It isn't fair.
{107769}{107829}They should've allowed you to examine everything.
{107862}{107887}That girl ... 
{107890}{107977}that Strode girl, that's Michael Myers sister.
{108010}{108040}She was born ... 
{108043}{108086}2 years before he was commited.
{108089}{108181}Two years after ... his parents died|and she was adopted by the Strodes.
{108184}{108332}They requested, that the records be sealed|in order to protect the family. - Jeez, don't you see,|what he's doing here in Haddonfield?
{108335}{108413}He killed one sister fifteen years ago.|Now he's trying to kill the other!
{108442}{108506}Tonight after I shot him, where did they take her?
{108517}{108542}The clinic.
{108547}{108603}Clinic where? Do you know this area well?
{108611}{108632}A little bit.
{108635}{108717}Where's the hospital located?|- Dr. Loomis we're under orders from the Governor!
{108720}{108770}It's back around Seventeen about three miles.
{108773}{108813}Turn this car around now!
{108816}{108862}I can't do that. I've got orders.
{108865}{108935}Those orders have changed!|- Dr. Loomis!
{108938}{108991}Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.
{108994}{109074}What is your fellows usually do?|Fire a warning shot, right?
{109904}{109923}Jimmy?
{110154}{110176}It's all right.
{110203}{110228}We're ...
{110242}{110286}Ok, we're gonna get out of here.
{110559}{110588}I think, I think ... 
{111928}{112019}I ought to handcuff you to the wheel,|but I have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.
{112022}{112049}Can I trust you?
{112074}{112105}What have I got to loose ... 
{112108}{112142}except my job?
