1
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,760
I want you to listen to me.

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,554
I want you to go out of the house

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,056
and down the street to the MacKenzies' house?

4
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,891
I want you to knock on their door,

5
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,601
I want you to tell them to call the police

6
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:03,437
and send them over here. All right?

7
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:05,147
- What - Now do as I say!

8
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,649
Yeah.

9
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,442
Go!

10
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:31,757
Come on! Get help!

11
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,925
Come on!

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,970
Come on! Come on!

13
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,795
Was that the boogie man?

14
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,427
As a matter of fact, it was.

15
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,652
What's going on out here?

16
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:57,862
Call the police.

17
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,156
- Tell the sheriff I shot him. - Who?

18
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,283
Tell him he's still on the loose!

19
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,911
Is this some kind of joke? I've been trick or treated to death tonight.

20
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,330
You don't know what death is.

21
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,501
Trick or treat!

22
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,152
- I shot him six times! - What?

23
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:11,615
I said I shot him six times! I shot him in the heart and...

24
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,075
He can't have gotten very far. Come on.

25
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,119
- I shot him six times. - Yeah, I know.

26
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:19,540
This guy, this man... He's not human!

27
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,857
Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich?

28
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,281
How about mustard?

29
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,284
- Oh, Harold... - Up next...

30
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,120
<i>a morsel of mind-melting madness, Night of the Living Dead.</i>

31
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,205
Are you asleep again?

32
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,260
<i>This is a WWAR special bulletin.</i>

33
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,472
<i>Police in Haddonfield have just made the grisly discovery</i>

34
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,058
<i>of three bodies in the upstairs bedrooms of this house.</i>

35
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,811
<i>It appears that the murders took place sometime early this evening.</i>

36
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,690
<i>Authorities have confirmed that all three of the victims are teenagers,</i>

37
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,778
<i>two girls and a boy. Police are searching the entire area</i>

38
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,946
for a mental patient who escaped last night

39
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,157
from the Smith's Grove-Warren County Sanitarium.

40
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:38,077
He is now believed to be at large in Haddonfield.

41
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,037
<i>This is Robert Mundy live.</i>

42
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,003
They're coming to get you, Barbara!

43
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,131
<i>Stop it! You're ignorant!</i>

44
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,717
<i>They're coming for you, Barbara!</i>

45
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,804
<i>Stop It! You're acting like a child!</i>

46
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,972
<i>They're coming for you!</i>

47
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,767
<i>Look, there comes one of them now!</i>

48
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,810
<i>He'll hear you!</i>

49
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,186
<i>Here he comes now!</i>

50
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,813
<i>I'm getting out of here!</i>

51
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,669
Mrs. EIrod?

52
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,963
Mr. Elrod?

53
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,092
Are you okay?

54
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,025
Hi. There was someone screaming next door.

55
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,194
Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. EIrod.

56
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,447
His wife's always picking on him.

57
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,200
He probably got angry and decided to start beating her.

58
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,830
Oh, big deal.

59
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>Are your folks home?</i>

60
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,709
They are gone.

61
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,295
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Hardin County

62
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,755
and my mother decided to go along.

63
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,424
<i>Didn't you hear?</i>

64
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,758
Hear about what?

65
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:20,095
Some <i>girl got killed in Haddonfield. It's on the radio.</i>

66
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,222
Hold on.

67
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:26,602
...so the police have cordoned off the entire area.

68
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,147
To repeat: Three teenagers have been found murdered in a house

69
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,940
in the northwest section of Haddonfield.

70
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,276
The names of the teenagers have not been released.

71
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,444
I can't believe it.

72
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,738
<i>I know. You know, we probably knew her.</i>

73
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,739
Where did it happen?

74
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:39,948
<i>Down on Orange Grove.</i>

75
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,618
That's right down the street.

76
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,994
<i>I know.</i>

77
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,913
<i>Police confirmed the girl was rescued as she fought...</i>

78
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,415
Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.

79
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,125
<i>They said the guy got away.</i>

80
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,461
- Do they know who It was? <i>- No.</i>

81
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,630
Oh, God.

82
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,299
<i>Allco?</i>

83
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:00,302
<i>Alice? What's wrong?</i>

84
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:02,804
<i>Alice?</i>

85
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,349
Who is it?

86
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,100
<i>Alice? Where are you?</i>

87
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,770
Who is it?

88
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,272
<i>Gary Hunt of the Haddonfield Police Department says he believes</i>

89
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:15,359
<i>the suspect will be apprehended within a matter of hours.</i>

90
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,487
<i>Neighbors said they heard screams during the early evening</i>

91
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,530
<i>but attributed the noise to the usual Halloween...</i>

92
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,682
I'm asking, what's going on? He said he shot somebody.

93
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,642
Inside, guys, will you?

94
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,894
<i>So he shot somebody.</i>

95
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,801
<i>All right, folks, give them room, will you, please?</i>

96
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,203
Laurie, can you hear me?

97
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,538
Don't let them put me to sleep.

98
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,873
It's all right, take it easy.

99
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,082
We're gonna go to the clinic, all right?

100
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:55,208
Don't let them put me to sleep.

101
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,543
It's okay.

102
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,471
Hey, you know this chick?

103
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,182
Yeah, her name's Laurie Strode.

104
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,519
Her old man Strode Realty?

105
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:16,563
- Yeah. - Okay.

106
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,833
Okay, just get out easy.

107
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,045
It's gonna be okay. Walk real slow, okay?

108
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,423
Are you all right? You all right, hon?

109
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,302
Oh, God! Oh!

110
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:51,056
Here, just put it up there real gently. You okay? Let's go.

111
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,474
Just walk real slow. Come on.

112
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,035
Fill out this form. Someone will be with you in a moment.

113
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,787
Well, we should see a doctor right away.

114
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,373
He's with a patient. Would you please wait in Room A?

115
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,584
Oh, come on, honey. Thank you.

116
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,337
<i>Where's Dr. Miner?</i>

117
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,589
He's been at the Country Club.

118
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,382
I think he's drunk. Oh, great.

119
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,092
What have you got?

120
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,510
Stab wound left anterior chest.

121
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,346
Possibly penetrating. Multiple contusions. It's Laurie Strode.

122
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,389
Yeah, yeah, come on, let's go.

123
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,599
Possibly fractured right ankle.

124
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:17,684
Janet, get me some more coffee.

125
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,102
Get that out of here.

126
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,025
Oh, Laurie, hi, there!

127
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,445
Well, let's see what we have here.

128
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:32,032
Ah, yes. You've lost a lot of blood.

129
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,201
We'll need to type it.

130
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,536
Yeah.

131
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,041
<i>When was the last time you had a tetanus shot?</i>

132
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,543
I don't know.

133
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,761
Get me some 3-0 nylon on a...

134
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,054
Cutting needle? Yes.

135
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,096
Right away.

136
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:56,223
We're going to have to put her out.

137
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,642
No! No, don't put me to sleep!

138
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:01,228
Okay, relax. Relax, we're not gonna hurt you.

139
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,979
No! No!

140
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,274
Please, don't put me to sleep.

141
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,819
Take it easy.

142
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,326
<i>Try to relax, Laurie.</i>

143
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,748
<i>Dr. Mixter will have you stitched up in no time.</i>

144
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,750
<i>Take it easy, Laurie.</i>

145
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,837
Circle the block again.

146
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,715
How long now?

147
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,634
It's about 30 minutes. Put the light down there.

148
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,760
There, by those trees.

149
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,471
Well, there's nothing.

150
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,056
Well, keep going!

151
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,976
You know, Doctor, I'm just about there.

152
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,060
What?

153
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,938
The point where I stop taking orders from you.

154
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,108
All right, Sheriff, whatever you want.

155
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,944
The primary concern is that we stop him!

156
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,696
You let him out.

157
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,365
I didn't. His own goddamn doctor!

158
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,117
I didn't let him out.

159
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,160
<i>Chief Brackett, come in, please.</i>

160
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,787
<i>Chief Brackett, come in, please.</i>

161
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,622
Who is it?

162
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,915
<i>Chief, this is...</i>

163
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,625
Say again, what is it?

164
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,751
<i>This is Ramsey.</i>

165
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,128
Where are you?

166
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,047
<i>I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville Road.</i>

167
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,966
Get the hell back into town.

168
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,302
Go up 17th Street and meet me by the Bypass.

169
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>10-4, Ramsey clear.</i>

170
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,307
Will you put that thing away?

171
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,436
You couldn't have shot him six times.

172
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,146
You think I'm lying, Sheriff?

173
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,149
I think you missed him. No man could take six slugs.

174
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,151
I'm telling you, this isn't a man!

175
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,653
Look out, slow down!

176
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,822
Over there! Look, look, look! Why?

177
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,202
Is that him? I don't know.

178
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,000
Get back! Run! Go on, run! Dr. Loomis!

179
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,753
Get back! Get back, you kids!

180
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,172
- Run! Stop! Get out... - Dr. Loomis!

181
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,923
- Loomis!

182
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,216
Loomis!

183
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,134
Stop!

184
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,179
Stop!

185
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,847
Don't shoot!

186
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,433
Stop! Don't...

187
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,655
Get him. Sheriff Brackett.

188
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,368
He came out of nowhere. I couldn't stop.

189
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,827
Is it him?

190
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,080
I don't know.

191
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:28,958
Is it him or not?

192
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,177
Leigh,

193
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,012
- Leigh, they found three bodies. - Where?

194
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,890
Across the street from the Doyle house.

195
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,225
Three kids.

196
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,686
Leigh, one of them was Annie!

197
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,062
What?

198
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,032
Does it hurt a lot?

199
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,618
What?

200
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,122
Oh, sweetie, I can't understand you! Look, it'll be okay.

201
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,374
We'll play some games tonight, and...

202
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,543
Repeating for those of you who just tuned in,

203
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,169
three people are dead tonight

204
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,381
<i>as the result of an attack by an escaped mental patient.</i>

205
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>I understand we're going to stay on the air now.</i>

206
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,886
<i>Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.</i>

207
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,973
<i>Three people are dead tonight as the result</i>

208
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,142
<i>of an attack by an escaped mental patient.</i>

209
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,104
<i>Any further details will be forthcoming as soon as we get them.</i>

210
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,191
<i>This is Robert Mundy reporting to you live.</i>

211
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,183
Hi.

212
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:10,477
Hi.

213
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,355
Jimmy, leave her alone.

214
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,150
Well, how are you feeling?

215
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,152
Sore.

216
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,655
What happened?

217
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,407
Cracked a bone.

218
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,075
You're lucky it wasn't a break.

219
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,829
<i>Dr. Mixter felt that he should wait until tomorrow before he put a cast on.</i>

220
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,457
You have to get some rest.

221
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,709
Come on, Jimmy.

222
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,637
Can I get you something to drink or anything?

223
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,348
How about a Coke?

224
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,392
Okay. Thanks.

225
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,311
Okay.

226
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,522
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta roll. Another call come in.

227
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,856
Okay. Okay. Come on.

228
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,107
Get you that Coke later.

229
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,026
Out!

230
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,781
Moments ago, police reported that

231
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,908
Michael Myers, formerly of Haddonfield,

232
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:09,953
who fled the Smith's Grove-Warren County Sanitarium last night,

233
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,538
was believed to have burned to death.

234
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,748
Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered

235
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,543
in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.

236
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,546
Identification of the victims is being withheld pending notification...

237
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,173
Forget that. Forget that. I wanna concentrate on the house.

238
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,802
Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.

239
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,388
All right, you need their parents' permission to use a statement.

240
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,890
If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.

241
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,435
Not now.

242
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,484
Just a minute, fellas.

243
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,727
I have to

244
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,439
go and tell my wife before somebody else does.

245
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:24,527
Go on home, Leigh.

246
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,321
Go on home. I'll take care of everything.

247
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,656
Damn you!

248
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,033
- I'm sorry. - What have you done?

249
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,326
I haven't done anything.

250
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,911
You let him out!

251
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,497
I didn't let him out, I gave orders for him to be restrained.

252
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,792
Now is there anything else that we can do for you'?

253
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,130
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car,

254
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,758
then a lot of other kids are gonna be slaughtered tonight.

255
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,843
He's dead! I saw him!

256
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:49,886
You saw a man in a mask.

257
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,179
It was him.

258
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,181
I wanna believe you, but I got to be sure.

259
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,350
I can't stop until I'm certain that he's dead.

260
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,186
You're talking about him like he's some kind of animal.

261
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,771
He was my... Would you keep it back?

262
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,023
He was my patient for 15 years.

263
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,858
He became an obsession with me until

264
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:05,944
I realized that there was nothing within him,

265
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,615
neither conscience nor reason, that was even remotely human.

266
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,202
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him.

267
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,037
He just got up and walked away.

268
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:20,249
I am talking about the real possibility that he is still out there!

269
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,670
Where'd they take the body?

270
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,963
Coroner's office.

271
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,340
Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.

272
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,937
<i>In spite of the fact that the man who rescued Laurie Strode</i>

273
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,107
<i>claims to have shot him six times at close range,</i>

274
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,067
<i>Haddonfield police have no explanation</i>

275
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,152
<i>for the suspect's disappearance,</i>

276
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:49,529
<i>but say they're confident he will</i>

277
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,614
<i>be captured soon. Paramedics are now</i>

278
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,865
<i>removing the last of the three bodies - I cannot believe it.</i>

279
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,867
Pin the Tail on the Donkey and bobbing for apples.

280
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,078
Actually bobbing in water, no less.

281
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,997
Well, you gotta use water. See, if you don't use water...

282
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,124
I'm never going to another Halloween party as long as I live,

283
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,376
especially not at Stevie Mathis' house.

284
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,086
And, of course, now I'm gonna be late.

285
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,088
Well, you gotta drive me home first.

286
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,339
Oh, Darcy, I don't have time.

287
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,841
Well, you've got to.

288
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,885
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

289
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,679
He's in Russellville.

290
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:15,680
Oh.

291
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:17,140
It's five minutes to your house,

292
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,766
another five minutes back to the hospital.

293
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,727
Mrs. Alves is gonna kill me.

294
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,229
You promised me.

295
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,983
I know I did.

296
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,550
There is one survivor.

297
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,010
Seventeen-year-old Laurie Strode

298
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,762
was found directly across the street

299
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,764
from the home where the murders took place.

300
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,640
The teenager was taken across town

301
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,267
to Haddonfield Memorial Clinic.

302
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,017
In the aftermath of the killings,

303
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:27,395
the streets between Chestnut and 10th

304
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,689
are jammed with people and cars.

305
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:34,902
Repeating that these streets are Chestnut and 10th.

306
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:37,071
They're just jammed with both people and cars.

307
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,657
Boy, I sure could go for a pizza now.

308
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,536
A nice big one with sausage, onions, peppers.

309
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,038
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

310
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,792
<i>The names of the young victims have not yet been released,</i>

311
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:52,503
<i>but the people in the crowd have recognized them as neighborhood teenagers.</i>

312
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,547
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

313
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,889
<i>Now back to Dementia!</i>

314
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,544
Thanks, Mr. Garrett.

315
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,761
Julie saw him, you know.

316
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,430
Who?

317
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,098
Michael Myers.

318
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,475
Come on.

319
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,769
I swear! Yesterday, when she was coming to work!

320
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:51,604
Where did she see him?

321
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,607
You know the Shop n Bag out by the mall?

322
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,026
Well, she stopped at a light

323
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,486
and saw him walking in that field

324
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,946
behind the Lost River drive-in.

325
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,324
Julie said he was so creepy.

326
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,117
Julie's full of shit!

327
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:07,078
He didn't escape until last night.

328
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,791
Well, you don't have to swear, Budd.

329
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,001
Wall, she's a goddamn moron, anyway.

330
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:16,504
Every other word you say is either "hell" or "shit" or "damn"!

331
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,966
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,467
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

333
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,861
Hi. You're late.

334
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,656
Yeah, I know. I've gotta get on the ward.

335
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,658
Hi, Jimmy.

336
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:47,326
Oh, hi, Karen.

337
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,626
See you later.

338
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:56,752
Right.

339
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:02,466
Amazing grace

340
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:05,136
Come sit on my face

341
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,139
Don't make me cry

342
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:10,182
I need your pie...

343
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,685
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

344
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,729
What are you all revved up about?

345
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,230
Look, it could have been Ziggy, you know.

346
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,441
And it could have been your brother Mark we pulled out of there.

347
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,401
All right, so what do you want me to do?

348
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:24,530
Look, Jimmy, rule number one, never get involved with a patient.

349
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,867
Nurses, that's another story,

350
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,578
but patients, it's no good. It never works out.

351
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,749
Where you going, college boy?

352
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,625
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

353
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,073
You were late again tonight.

354
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,576
Just 15 minutes.

355
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,120
That could be the difference between

356
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,663
life and death for one of those kids.

357
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,417
You're right, I'm sorry, Mrs. Alves. It's just that I...

358
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,001
I don't wanna hear any excuses.

359
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,462
You're a good nurse, Karen, I'd hate to lose you,

360
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:05,673
but you've got to learn to be on time.

361
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,883
Now let's go over this list.

362
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,677
It'll be fine, really, I promise. I'm very sorry.

363
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,433
Carr, Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tomorrow morning.

364
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,477
God, they should have... They should have handled him more carefully.

365
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:20,646
Who?

366
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,607
Michael Myers.

367
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,278
Michael Myers?

368
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,739
Yeah, he was the guy that was after you.

369
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,495
You mean, the Myers house?

370
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,292
That little kid who killed his sister?

371
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,334
Yeah.

372
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,048
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

373
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:49,884
He escaped last night.

374
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,719
How do you know?

375
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,848
It's all over the radio. Television, too. It's on right now.

376
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,564
Why me?

377
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,650
I mean, why me?

378
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,239
Time's up, Jimmy. Let's go.

379
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,450
Okay, okay.

380
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,748
- I'll be back - No, you won't!

381
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,833
Visiting hours are definitely over!

382
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,131
Men, you can't live with them, you can't live without them.

383
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,301
How's that shoulder feel?

384
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,178
Better.

385
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,387
Good.

386
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,265
We've been trying to get a hold of your parents.

387
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,101
Dr. Mixter told me they were at the same party he was,

388
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,229
but they're not there now and they're not at home.

389
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,356
Do you have any idea where else they might be?

390
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,192
No.

391
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:51,237
I'll just keep trying then.

392
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,498
Oh, this is just...

393
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,376
Janet?

394
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,089
Yes, Mrs. Alves?

395
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,383
Go tell Mr. Garrett we're having trouble with the phones.

396
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,717
Right now.

397
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,428
But he's at the other end of the hall. Janet.

398
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,139
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

399
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,102
What's wrong with the phones?

400
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:27,481
Nothing for you to worry about.

401
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,692
Just get some rest right now.

402
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,695
I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.

403
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,225
I'm gonna go check the pole.

404
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,435
You wait here and I'll call you.

405
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,853
I have to get back on the floor.

406
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,563
It'll take me five minutes.

407
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,481
But I don't even know how to use this thing.

408
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,872
I think somebody broke into the storeroom.

409
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,499
The lock was off.

410
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:21,131
Mr. Garrett? I can't hear you.

411
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,260
One of you had better drive down

412
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,678
to the sheriff's station right away.

413
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,062
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

414
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:36,688
Janet?

415
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:05,759
Mr. Garrett?

416
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:06,945
Mr. Garrett?

417
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:12,618
Mr. Garrett, I gotta get back on the floor!

418
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,706
Hello?

419
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:34,806
It's difficult,

420
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,518
even the gums are charred, but look here.

421
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,148
See here? No fillings.

422
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,610
He's young, maybe 17, maybe 18.

423
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,779
Michael Myers is 21.

424
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,699
Positive I.D. means we check X-rays and dental records.

425
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:54,159
That'll take hours.

426
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,161
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.

427
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,663
We haven't got hours.

428
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,206
Listen to me. We've got to assume

429
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,999
that Michael Myers is still alive.

430
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:07,547
Everybody goes back out.

431
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,216
But we just closed it up.

432
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,010
I want a sweep from Chestnut South to the Bypass.

433
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,598
I want every street, every house, every backyard...

434
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,726
Okay. You got it.

435
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:26,441
Thank you.

436
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:38,245
All right, that's enough! That's enough!

437
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,247
Come on, get out of here, you guys. Go home.

438
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,874
You guys get out of here. Go on.

439
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,427
This is Hunt. Send another vehicle.

440
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,429
The old Myers house, 45 Lampkin Lane.

441
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:59,975
The tribe. One of their number was butchered. This is the wake.

442
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,400
Heightens my sense of security.

443
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,458
All right, knock it off!

444
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,461
Come on, folks, go home!

445
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,712
Somebody get rid of it!

446
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,796
Knock it off!

447
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:37,179
Empty. Plus we covered the whole east end of town. Nothing.

448
00:42:37,512 --> 00:42:38,680
Check it again.

449
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,265
He just isn't there!

450
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:41,767
Check it again!

451
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:44,770
You know,

452
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,606
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.

453
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,734
The only gunshots you ever heard

454
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,445
were to start the track meet at the local high school.

455
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:59,159
Yet one night in 1963, Michael Myers did murder his sister

456
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,037
in that upstairs bedroom with a large butcher knife.

457
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:04,456
I remember.

458
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,874
On Halloween.

459
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,250
I was 16 years old.

460
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,961
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

461
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:12,839
He came back.

462
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,966
After 15 years?

463
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,969
He waited with extraordinary patience.

464
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,058
There was a force inside him biding its time.

465
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:28,105
The staff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence.

466
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,525
In many ways, he was the ideal patient.

467
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:35,570
He didn't talk, he didn't cry, he didn't even move.

468
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,489
He just waited.

469
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:43,078
The staff was unprepared. They didn't know what he was.

470
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:45,497
Did you know?

471
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:47,707
Yeah, I knew.

472
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:50,168
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

473
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,212
Yeah, what is it, Craig?

474
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,380
Yeah, I'm worried about Bennett Tramer.

475
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,506
He isn't home yet.

476
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,882
Yeah, and he left the party at 10:00.

477
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:58,468
It's only a little after 11:00, boys.

478
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,387
He was real drunk.

479
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,596
How old is he?

480
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:02,931
Seventeen.

481
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,016
He had this stupid mask on.

482
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,018
All right, boys.

483
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,688
Seventeen? And wearing a mask.

484
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,234
Oh, God! Maybe we should check his dental records.

485
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,864
Old Reservoir Road. They had a break-in at the elementary school.

486
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,365
They're pretty sure it's him. Come on.

487
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,175
Stop!

488
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,426
OW! Shit!

489
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,429
Shit! Oh, you idiot!

490
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:26,556
You could've broken it.

491
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,017
I wish I had!

492
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,813
I also could have used these on you!

493
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:36,983
What an asshole!

494
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:38,151
Happy Halloween!

495
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:44,616
Budd, you are the biggest jerk I've ever met!

496
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:50,247
But you love me.

497
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,290
Yeah,

498
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:54,626
and I'm an idiot.

499
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,096
Let's go down to the therapy room.

500
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,849
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

501
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,477
I can't leave the kids right now.

502
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:16,731
But every/body's all weirded out tonight. All this Michael Myers crap.

503
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,609
I just...

504
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:23,655
I just want...

505
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,592
The therapy room is three doors down.

506
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,682
I suppose if we left the door open,

507
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,350
we could hear if somebody was coming,

508
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:54,602
or if one of the kids started to cry.

509
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,231
No, I've gotta check it out first.

510
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:00,608
Fifteen minutes.

511
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,404
If everything's okay.

512
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:07,365
You're wasting time.

513
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,004
<i>Why won't you tell me?</i>

514
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:23,089
<i>Why won't you ever tell me anything?</i>

515
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,552
I told you, I'm not your mother.

516
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,606
Ow!

517
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,983
It's hot.

518
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:31,259
Whew!

519
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:34,888
It's hot in here.

520
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,390
It's just me.

521
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,490
I'm not kidding.

522
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,035
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

523
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,037
Why don't you go check it?

524
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:02,040
It's cold out there.

525
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,335
It can get cold in here.

526
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,756
Gotcha.

527
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:28,293
Forget it, Budd. I have to go back to work.

528
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:38,136
Do you wanna go for breakfast later?

529
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,730
I'm sorry.

530
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,277
I just have to get back, that's all.

531
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,322
Now, Budd, don't be that way.

532
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,699
No!

533
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,412
Oh, God!

534
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,404
He got in here.

535
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,741
And look over here.

536
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,376
And here.

537
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,844
Sister.

538
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,472
Is that it?

539
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,640
No.

540
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,392
Here.

541
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:15,566
What's this?

542
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,068
It's gibberish.

543
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,196
No. It's a Celtic word.

544
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:25,910
It means, "The Lord of the Dead.??

545
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,870
"The end of summer."

546
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,999
The festival of Samhain,

547
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,419
October 31st.

548
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,588
Dr. Loomis?

549
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,923
Yes?

550
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,509
I have to talk to you.

551
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,847
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

552
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,640
What are you doing here?

553
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,017
Privately.

554
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:01,821
Thanks.

555
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:06,492
Dr. Loomis, you've been ordered back to Smiths-Grove.

556
00:54:07,326 --> 00:54:09,829
Ordered? They can't order me.

557
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,915
No, no, but the Governor can.

558
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:15,501
He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.

559
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:18,337
The Governor? Well, well.

560
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:21,632
Dr. Loomis, this thing is all over the state.

561
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,428
Your patient escapes once, murders three teenagers,

562
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,805
you shoot him with a gun, he escapes again!

563
00:54:27,805 --> 00:54:30,433
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

564
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,059
I know, I'm sorry.

565
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,521
Dr. Rogers is just afraid this could jeopardize

566
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:37,482
our whole rehabilitation program.

567
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,692
He doesn't want anyone from the Mental Health Department

568
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:41,027
anywhere near Haddonfield.

569
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,488
Why did he send you down here then?

570
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:47,533
In case you'd already found him alive.

571
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:49,160
Tell Dr. Rogers...

572
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,204
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.

573
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,498
I can't leave Haddonfield now.

574
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,042
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

575
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,337
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

576
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:17,688
<i>Laurie?</i>

577
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:23,653
Listen,

578
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,032
I know that you don't know me very well,

579
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:31,869
but I just wanna let you know that

580
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,914
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

581
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,958
Okay?

582
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,085
Promise.

583
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,716
<i>Laurie?</i>

584
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:54,934
Shit!

585
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,952
<i>Dr. Miner?</i>

586
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,665
<i>Dr. Miner?</i>

587
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,588
Dr. Mixter!

588
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,356
<i>Dr. Miner?</i>

589
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,614
Dr. Mixter? It's an emergency.

590
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,750
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

591
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,753
She's had a reaction to the medication.

592
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,588
You better come quick!

593
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,094
Dr. Mixter.

594
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,972
This is ridiculous! I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

595
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,108
Mrs. Alves?

596
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,901
Laurie? You okay?

597
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,299
We'll find him.

598
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:44,468
Where you gonna look?

599
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:46,136
I don't know.

600
01:02:47,471 --> 01:02:48,889
Neither do I.

601
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:19,670
Mr. Garrett?

602
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,905
<i>Mr. Garrett?</i>

603
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,558
Mr. Garrett?

604
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,812
Mr. Garrett?

605
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:21,690
Sorry.

606
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:26,070
Listen, I can't find anybody.

607
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,615
Budd's gone, Mrs. Alves is gone.

608
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,451
We gotta find Laurie.

609
01:04:33,243 --> 01:04:35,204
All right, listen...

610
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,707
I want you to check the East Wing again, all right?

611
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,752
And if you don't find anybody, I want you to get into your oar

612
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,213
and drive out to the sheriff's station and get someone out here,

613
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,216
all right?

614
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,386
Okay.

615
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:51,762
Okay. I'll keep looking.

616
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:13,826
Hello?

617
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:48,360
Jesus!

618
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:34,693
Laurie!

619
01:08:38,905 --> 01:08:41,366
Laurie! Laurie, wait!

620
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:45,704
Wait, Laurie!

621
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:43,215
Come on!

622
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,905
You didn't believe me. Nobody did.

623
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:32,282
I'm sorry.

624
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:36,119
Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry for that little town back there.

625
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,122
It'll be years before they forget this.

626
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,960
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else you should know.

627
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:47,213
Did you see the blackboard back there at the elementary school?

628
01:13:47,797 --> 01:13:48,882
Yeah.

629
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:54,763
In order to appease the gods, the Druid priests held fire rituals.

630
01:13:55,513 --> 01:14:01,144
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane, animals were

631
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:04,648
burned alive in baskets.

632
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,108
By observing the way they died,

633
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:10,153
the Druids believed they could see omens of the future.

634
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:14,950
Two thousand years later we've come no further.

635
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,537
Samhain isn't the evil spirit.

636
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:23,333
It isn't goblins and ghosts or witches,

637
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,504
it's the unconscious mind.

638
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:32,175
We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.

639
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,721
Dr. Loomis, please, listen to me.

640
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:39,808
There's a file on Michael Myers that nobody knew about.

641
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:40,934
I've seen everything.

642
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,394
No! No, it was hidden,

643
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:45,188
sealed by the court after his parents were killed.

644
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,775
Now, after the Governor heard what happened tonight,

645
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,277
he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

646
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:52,862
What file?

647
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,740
It isn't fair.

648
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,826
They should have allowed you to examine everything.

649
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,122
That girl, that Strode girl,

650
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,332
that's Michael Myers' sister!

651
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,753
She was born two years before he was committed.

652
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,172
Two years after, his parents died,

653
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:13,008
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

654
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,593
They requested that the records be sealed

655
01:15:15,593 --> 01:15:17,178
in order to protect the family.

656
01:15:17,178 --> 01:15:19,431
Jesus, don't you see what he's doing here in Haddonfield?

657
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:20,890
He killed one sister 15 years ago,

658
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,225
now he's trying to kill the other!

659
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:26,146
Tonight, after I shot him, where did they take her?

660
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,148
The clinic.

661
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:30,233
The clinic? Where... Do you know this area well?

662
01:15:30,942 --> 01:15:32,110
A little bit.

663
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,278
Where is the hospital located?

664
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:35,447
Dr. Loomis, we're under orders from the Governor.

665
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,657
It's back on Route 17, about three miles.

666
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:39,617
Turn this car around, now!

667
01:15:39,617 --> 01:15:41,411
I can't do that. I've got orders!

668
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,038
Those orders just changed!

669
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,414
Dr. Loomis!

670
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,458
Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.

671
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:49,586
What is it you fellows usually do? Fire a warning shot, right?

672
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:25,497
Jimmy?

673
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:38,051
It's all right. We're...

674
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:40,887
We're gonna get out of here.

675
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,233
I think...

676
01:17:49,455 --> 01:17:50,999
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel,

677
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,876
but I have a feeling I'm going to need you in there.

678
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,419
Can I trust you?

679
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:57,922
What have I got to lose except my job?

680
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,843
Help me.

681
01:18:03,928 --> 01:18:05,221
Help!

682
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:07,307
Help!

683
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,436
Help me!

684
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:22,947
Go and check all the rooms down there. Go on!

685
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,241
Dr. Loomis! You stay with me and shut up!

686
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,068
Help!

687
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,113
Help!

688
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,075
Help!

689
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:09,661
Help!

690
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:14,958
Help! Help!

691
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:17,418
Help!

692
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:19,045
Help!

693
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,297
Please!

694
01:19:22,006 --> 01:19:23,132
Please!

695
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,928
Please! Help!

696
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:29,681
Help me!

697
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,349
Come on, get in!

698
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,510
Stop! He's dead.

699
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,679
No, he's not! Look at him! He's still breathing!

700
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,474
Okay.

701
01:20:15,518 --> 01:20:17,186
There's a two-way radio in the marshal's car.

702
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:20,023
I want you to go outside, get on that radio and get Hunt!

703
01:20:21,065 --> 01:20:22,692
Now, wait a minute!

704
01:20:22,692 --> 01:20:24,527
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

705
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:25,903
Move!

706
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:32,994
I'm sorry I left you. Are you all right?

707
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,249
Why won't he die?

708
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:42,378
Get away from him!

709
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,255
But he stopped breathing!

710
01:20:44,255 --> 01:20:45,465
No!

711
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:53,491
Unit calling, identify.

712
01:21:53,741 --> 01:21:56,285
Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis at the clinic.

713
01:21:56,285 --> 01:21:57,370
He's here.

714
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,081
10-4. Unit calling, identify suspect.

715
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,541
Michael Myers!

716
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,126
Just get your ass over here!

717
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,616
Come on, come on, come on. No!

718
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:36,909
Take it. No!

719
01:22:37,785 --> 01:22:38,870
Take it!

720
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:31,881
Michael?

721
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,107
Michael, stop!

722
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:23,451
He's an animal! He's an animal!

723
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:25,411
Go on, get out.

724
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:28,831
Get out, now!

725
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,341
It's time, Michael.

726
01:26:57,461 --> 01:26:58,921
What's the count?

727
01:26:58,921 --> 01:27:01,298
Ten, so far.

728
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:11,308
If I could just get a word or two.

729
01:27:11,308 --> 01:27:13,686
- Do you have any first-hand information... - Just leave her alone.

730
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:15,271
About what happened inside the hospital?

731
01:27:18,065 --> 01:27:19,150
Can't I ride in front?

732
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,360
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I have to put you in back.

733
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,779
You ready? Watch out for your feet.

734
01:27:24,071 --> 01:27:25,823
She's now being assisted out of the wheelchair...

735
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:26,991
Up we go. Careful. And foot.

736
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,325
And into the ambulance.

737
01:27:29,618 --> 01:27:32,788
Big step. Big step.

738
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,415
Okay.

739
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,585
Keep the leg up, we'll have you out of here in a second.

740
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:42,131
Okay.
