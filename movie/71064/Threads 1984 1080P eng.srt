00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:14,765
- In an urban society,
everything connects.

2
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:19,270
Each person's needs are fed
by the skills of many others.

3
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,773
Our lives are woven together in a fabric,

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,861
but the connections
that make society strong

5
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,946
also make it vulnerable.

6
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,335
- Peaceful up here, isn't it?

7
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,050
Oh, I'd love to live out in the country.

8
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,927
Wouldn't you, Jimmy?

9
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:33,886
- Would I, heck!

10
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:34,804
- Why not?

11
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,181
- It's dead.

12
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,016
Nowt to do.

13
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,853
Just imagine living down there.

14
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,688
Take you an hour to get
to the nearest boozer.

15
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,609
- Oh, I know, but the air's lovely.

16
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,531
Do you know, I love it this time of year

17
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,449
with spring coming on.

18
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,785
Look, see the leaves just coming out

19
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,870

- I'm trying to make
out where our house is.

23
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,926
Wish I had a pair of binoculars.

24
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,512
You can see the floodlights
at United, look.

25
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,429
- With the news...

26
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,264
- Oh, what time is it?

27
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,807
- There's
been further fighting in Iran...

28
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,725
- The half-time scores
will be on in a minute.

29
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,519
- This is the Civil War...

30
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,854
- Oh, honestly!

31
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,231
We come out here for a drive,

32
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,566
we're surrounded by all this countryside

33
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:32,111
and all you can think about is football?

34
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,237
- It's not all I can think about.

35
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,488
- Oh, stop it.

36
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,952
Honestly, you've got no
consideration at all, sometimes.

37
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,955
You think you can do what you like.

38
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:45,749
- Where are you going?

39
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,210

one, Manchester United nil.

40
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,545

Division, two, Barnsley,
one, Derby County, nil...

43
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,635
- There you are, it's a peace offering.

44
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,929
Not much smell to it, though.

45
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,139
- It's lovely.

46
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,519
- Heather's supposed to
bring good luck, innit?

47
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,938
- It's what they say.

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,608
- Wonder if it'll bring me any.

49
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,459

50
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,337
by a West German

shows one of the Soviet convoys

52
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,674
on the move in northern Iran.

53
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,259
The convoys were first spotted

54
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,803
by United States satellites on Monday

55
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,388

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,808
passes leading from the Soviet Union.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,435
The Soviet foreign minister

58
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,145
has defended the incursions

59
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,605
and has accused the United States

60
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:50,940
of deliberately prompting

61
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,442
last week's coup in Iran.

62
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,319
Speaking on his arrival in Vienna,

63
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,738
Mr. Gromyko claims the Soviet vehicles

64
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,491
were responding to an
appeal, from an official...

65
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:01,742
- Are you serious?

66
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:02,952
- Of course I'm being serious.

67
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,037
I've never been more serious in my life.

68
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,248
- Covert activities in Iran.

69
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,042
- What are we going to do, Jimmy.

70
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:10,960
Jimmy.

71
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,921
- Are you sure?

72
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,798
- Well not definitely.

73
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,344
I'm normally as regular as clockwork.

74
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,929
Anyway, what if I am?

75
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,431
It's not the end of the world, is it?

you want your bloody head seeing to.

87
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,329

something else seeing to as well.

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,998
- Don't blame me, it's not my fault.

89
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,042
- Whose fault is
it, you daft bugger?

90
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,877
- Don't go blaming it all on Ruth, Jimmy.

91
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,295
That's not fair.

92
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,217
It's irrelevant who's to blame now.

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,260
There you are.
- Ta.

94
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,639
- The point is, what are
you going to do about it?

95
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,892
- We're gonna get married.

96
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,729
- What for?

97
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,857
- Because we want to, what do you think?

98
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,817
- You don't have to, you know, Jimmy.

99
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,528
I wouldn't want you thinking
we were pushing you into it.

100
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,239
- Nobody's pushing us into owt.

101
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,283
It's what we want, we've decided.

102
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,084
- I suppose you've
talked about an abortion?

103
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:19,421
- Course we have, but
neither of us want that.

104
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,548
Wanna get married and have the baby.

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,674

106
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,884
Abortion.
- Michael!

107

- Never mind what it means,
you get on with your game.

108
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,889
It's nothing to do with you.

109

- We were thinking of
getting engaged anyway.

110
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,108
So it don't make much difference, really,

111
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,487
it's just brought it
forward a bit, that's all.

112
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,407
- I hope you know what
you're doing, Jimmy.

113
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,908
It's a hell of a time
to be starting a family,

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,160
in the middle of a recession.

115
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:52,746

116

- I might be, why?

120
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,507
- Well, it's a bit sudden, innit?

121
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,259
You're not even engaged.

or in a registry office?

126
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,393

127

- Oh, so that's it.

I haven't done anything yet.

00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,762
A Pentagon spokesman

181
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,807
has refused to be drawn one
way or the other on the crisis

182
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,727
carrying all reporters' questions...

183
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,978
- Oh.
- Hello.

184
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,147
- Do come in, do come in.

185
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,317
- Mum, Mrs. Kemp, Mr. Kemp.

186
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,610
- Pleased to meet you.

187
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,777
- How do you do?

188
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,112
- How do you do?

189
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,072
- Jimmy, my
dad, Mr. and Mrs. Kemp.

190
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,490
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

191
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,325
- How do you do?

192
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,659
- How do you do, Mrs. Kemp?

193
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,704
- Oh, do go through.
- Thank you very much.

194
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,788
- Thank you.

195
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,300
BBC news at 8:00.

196
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,260
The Soviet Union has protested strongly

197
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,137
to the United States about what it calls

198
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,640
dangerous provocations
by American war ships

199
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,643
in the Gulf of Oman yesterday.

200
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,686
This follows an incident
in which serious damage

201
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,314
was caused to the Soviet cruiser Kirov

202
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,568
when she was in collision with
the U.S. destroyer Callaghan.

203
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,364
- It's in a bit of a state,

204
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,491
but it's got possibilities.

205
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:58,700
- I'd have that door stripped down,

206
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,536
all this paper off and the walls white.

207
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,747
- There's about 16 layers on here.

208
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,956
- Ah, my mother and dad'll help us,

209
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm sure they will.

210
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,753
- My dad'll give us a hand as well.

211
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,090
He'll be glad of summat to do.

212
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,886
- What you laughing at?

213
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,346
Just thinking of his
face when my mother said

214
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,098
we could borrow his redundancy money.

215
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,391
- Oh don't.

216
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,017
- He were fancying a
trip to Bermuda on it.

217
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,312
- Looks like being Blackpool again.

218
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,313
- Oh, dear.

219
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,400
I like the gardens.

220
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,405
I think it's lovely for children
to have somewhere to play.

221
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,866
- I wonder if they'll let me
build an aviary down there.

222
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,035
- Oh, you and your birds.

223
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,873
- Makes you feel funny, though, don't it?

224
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,917
- What do you mean?

225
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,421
- Us owning a home, being
married, having children.

226
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,172
Enough to put years on you, isn't it?

227
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,341
- Don't be silly.

228
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,759
It'll be lovely.

229
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,513
I just know it will.

230
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,283
- Here, love.

231
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,200
- Ta.

232
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,414
- American and Israeli
search and rescue vessels

233
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,667
in the area, today came
across debris and oil slicks

234
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,754
that could only have come
from the missing submarine.

235
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,131
It's still being said in
Washington that the Los Angeles

236
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,175
was on a routine reconnaissance mission

237
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,969
off the coast of Iran,
when she sank last Tuesday

238
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,305
with a loss of all hands.

239
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,100
After paying tribute to
her 127 officers and men,

240
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,978
the President said he
held the Soviet Union

241
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,022
solely responsible for their deaths

242
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,566
and for the vessel's disappearance.

243
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,650
- The unprovoked attack

244
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,737
on our submarine and the move into Iran

245
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,365
are the actions of a
reckless and warlike power.

246
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,203
I have to warn the Soviets in
the clearest possible terms

247
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,829
that they risk taking us to the brink

248
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,915
of an armed confrontation

249
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,877
with incalculable
consequences for all mankind.

250
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,758
- Britain has
emergency plans for war.

251
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,052
If central government should ever fail,

252
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,595
power can be transferred instead

253
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,555
to a system of local officials

254
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,642
dispersed across the country.

255
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,727
In an urban district like Sheffield,

256
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,064
there is already a designated
wartime controller.

257
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,442
He's the city's peacetime chief executive.

258
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,528
If it should suddenly become necessary,

259
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,198
he can be given full powers
of internal government.

260
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,119
When, or if, this happens
depends on the crisis itself.

261
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,921
- The United States government

262
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,882
has been forced,
reluctantly, to take action

263
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,467
to safeguard what it believes

264
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,221
are legitimate Western
interests in the Middle East.

265
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,348
This administration has therefore resolved

266
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,059
to send units of its
rapid deployment force,

267
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,021
the U.S. Central Command,
into western Iran.

268
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,107
We are confident that the Soviet Union

269
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,276
will take note of our resolve

270
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:23,530
and will desist from its present
perilous course of action.

271
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,187
- Now on to football,

272
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,273
there's an important score
coming in from the Hawthorns,

273
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,941
where West Brom have taken the lead

274
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,485
over First Division
leaders, Manchester United.

275
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,155
It's West Brom one, Manchester United nil,

276
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,990
McKenzie getting that all-important goal.

277
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,794
- Thank you very much, sir.

278
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,047
- Thank you.

279
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,551
- So, if you want to
tighten up the thigh muscles,

280
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,054
these are very simple
but very good exercises.

281
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,889
Now the only piece of equipment you want

282
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,891
is a chair with legs.

283
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,810
Right, I'll just let you
listen to the lovely.

284
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,526
- Hello.

285
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,112
- Mary, I want you to
contact the following people

286
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,822
and have them in my
office in 10 minutes time.

287
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:48,698
I don't care what they're doing,

288
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,991
they're to drop it and
get here right away.

289
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,076
Is that clear?

290
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,036
Right, you got a pencil?

291
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:53,954
OK.

292
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,707
Alan Boulton, George Cox,

293
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,126
Roger Fisher, Susan Russell.

294
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,088
Yes, Administration.

295
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,299
Tony Barnes, Roy Chamberlain...

296
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,938
- It's busy for a Wednesday, isn't it?

297
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,314
You'd think it were Christmas.

298
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,781
- Best of the
weather again tomorrow,

299
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,074
it looks as if northern.

300
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,242
- And what about the food situation?

301
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,743
What have we got?

302
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,621
And what about flour?

303
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,667
What else is there?

304
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,751
Corned beef.

305
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,880
I hope it's not from Argentina.

306
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,592
OK, what about supplies
to the first-aid post?

307
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:50,927
Is that all?

308
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,014
Well, that's not going to
get us very far, is it?

309
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:54,931
What?

310
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,394
Well, I'm sure I don't know if I'm honest.

311
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,647
We've heard nothing about
emergency powers as yet.

312
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,399
Anyway, don't make a
song and dance about it.

313
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,026
Just get on with it.

314
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,528
And don't tell anybody
you don't have to, eh?

315
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,904
OK.

316
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,345
- The remaining units

317
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,598
of the United States
Tenth Airborne Division,

318
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,184
which parachuted into
western Iran yesterday,

319
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,853
have taken up defensive
positions near Isfahan,

320
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,772
designed, according to the spokesman,

321
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,523
to block any possible move towards

322
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,651
the oilfields in the Persian Gulf.

323
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,945
Squadrons of American B-52 bombers

324
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,073
have been arriving at
U.S. bases in Turkey...

325
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,033
- All right then?
- All right lad.

326
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,869
- Together with three
AWACS early-warning aircraft.

327
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,246
It's believed they'll be
used in a supporting role

328
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,040
to the Middle East task force.

329
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,083
- All right, John?

330
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,126
- The 84th Airborne
Division has also been placed

331
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,171
on a state of combat readiness...

332
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,464
- Come to give me a hand, then?

333
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,550
- No chance, I've done enough
for one day, I'm knackered.

334
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,095
- Not too knackered to be
going out though, I see.

335
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,138
- It's different, innit?

336
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,972
Anyway I need a break.

337
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,725
I've been down at the house
every night this week.

338
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,602
- How's it coming on?

339
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,229
- Not too bad.

340
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,939
Trying to get the living
room and bedroom finished

341
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:26,981
before we move in.

342
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,365
Ruth says will you take some flowers down

343
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,200
when you've finished?

344
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,620
- Third since teatime.
- Aye.

345
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,124
- Where they going to?

346
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,167
- Finningley, I suppose.

347
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,961
- Why don't you pop down to
WH Smith's and buy yourself

348
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,879
an aircraft spotter's book?

349
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,298
You can start a new hobby,
make a change from gardening.

350
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,051
- You can laugh but there's
summat going on, I'm telling ya.

351
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,762
- There'll be summat going
on tonight after a few pints.

352
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:58,888
- Don't be going mad.

353
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,932
You haven't only got yourself
to think about now, you know.

354
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,392
- Why not?

355
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,353
Might as well enjoy
myself while I'm single.

356
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,064
Not long to go now, you know.

357
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,400
- You could be right there.

358
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,395
- Come on, hit it off.

359
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,479
- I'll have a half.

360
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,314
- Half?

361
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,148
What's up with you?

362
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,068
Getting into training
for when you're married?

363
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,034
Two bitters, please.

364
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:01,951
Cheers.

365
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,755
- In a statement issued a
short time ago by the Pentagon

366
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,132
in Washington, the
United States has accused

367
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,135
the Soviet Union of
moving nuclear warheads

368
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,805
into their new base at
Mashad in northern Iran.

369
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,768
According to the American spokesman...

370
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,978
- Hey, I were watching that.

371
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,522
- Turn it back again.

372
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,566
- Aboard two giant Antonov transport

373
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,818
planes late yesterday afternoon,

374
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,445
and were immediately moved under cover

375
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,529
into temporary hangars.

376
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,364
- See that?

377
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,365
I were watching that
thing about the Far East

378
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,783
and he turns it over.

379
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:42,617
- Far East?

380
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:43,993
What's going on there?

381
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:44,827
- Iran.

382
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,913
The Americans have just...
- Iran?

383
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,414
That's not the Far East, you pillock,

384
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,666
that's the Middle East.

385
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,168
China, Hong Kong, that's the Far East.

386
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,169
- So what?

387
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,338
It's far enough, innit?

388
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,714
- Sooner go to the Near East myself.

389
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,508
Scarborough and Skegness.

390
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,968
- Skeggy?

391
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,637
I'd rather watch my
toenails grow than go there.

392
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,347
- Never mind that rubbish.

393
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,809
What about these two birds
at eight of this then?

394
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:08,810
- NATO's position

395
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,437
on the United States' action in sending...

396
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,773
- You're dead right, you
know, it's getting serious.

397
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,067
- There's naught we can
do about it, is there?

398
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,236
Might as well enjoy
ourselves whilst we can.

399
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,405
- Don't it scare you,
what it might lead to?

400
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,281
- Yeah, it bloody scares me

401
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,533
but there's nowt we can
do about it, is there?

402
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,743
Tell ya one thing, if the bomb
does drop, I wanna be pissed

403
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:30,665
out of my mind and strapped
underneath it when it happens.

404
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,167
- Arriving here in
Brussels a short time ago,

405
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,211
the NATO Secretary General...

406
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,046
- Come on, you miserable bugger.

407
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,465
It's all these family responsibilities.

408
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,676
You're acting like a married man already.

409
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:42,802
- It'll not be long now, you know.

410
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,137
- You might as well make the best of it

411
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,597
whilst you can, haven't ya?

412
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,350
What about chatting
these two birds up, then?

413
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,394
- Divisions within NATO
is something we shall know

414
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,979
in a few hours' time.

415
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,522
- I can't do that.

416
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,899
- Come on, it might be the
last chance you'll get.

417
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,110
Anyway, if we are gonna cop it,

418
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,071
might as well go out with a
bang that's what I would say.

419
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,615
- Can't be many better
ways of going, I suppose.

420
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,367
Blown up on the job.

421
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,704
- And we've just heard
that the Prime Minister

422
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,081
has issued a message of support

423
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,750
for the United States government.

424
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
The statement just released
from Downing Street

425
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,505
condemns what it calls,
reckless Soviet actions

426
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,676
which can only worsen an
already grave situation.

427
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,225
- To the Director of Technical Services.

428
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,061
Please let me know what fuel stocks

429
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,228
are currently held in each depot.

430
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,147
Please ensure tanks are kept topped up

431
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:40,401
and that no fuel is used except
for essential works only.

432
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:30,785
- There's been no response

433
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,078
from the Soviet government as yet

434
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,913
to the United States' ultimatum

435
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,499
delivered to Moscow last night.

436
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,543
The American note calls
for joint withdrawal

437
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,920
of all US and Soviet forces from Iran

438
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,880
by noon on Sunday.

439
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,882
However, NATO observers in West Germany

440
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,592
have reported increasing build-ups

441
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,469
of Warsaw Pact troops and vehicles

442
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,306
at points along the central
frontier this morning.

443
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,308
The Ministry of Defense
has announced it's sending

444
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,893
more troops to Europe to reinforce

445
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,104
the British commitment to NATO.

446
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:02,233
The first contingents left
RAF Brize Norton this morning.

447
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,110
- Jobs not bombs!

448
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,945
Jobs not bombs!

449
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,780
Jobs not bombs!

450
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,449
Jobs not bombs!

451
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,409
Jobs not bombs!

452
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,411
Jobs not bombs!

453
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,288
Jobs not bombs!

454
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,622
Jobs not bombs!

455
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,176
- The day has
been marred by a number of

456
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,261
demonstrations up and down the country,

457
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,555
reflecting support for and
against the government's

458
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,391
decision to reinforce Europe.

459
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,810
Although most of these
passed off without incident,

460
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,438
police made a number of
arrests for disorderly conduct

461
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,107
at rallies in the North and Midlands.

462
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,525
- The government has taken control

463
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,612
of British Airways and
all cross channel ferries.

464
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,905
They say it's a temporary step

465
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,991
to help move troops to Europe.

466
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,786
Thousands are stranded
at Heathrow and Gatwick.

467
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,207
And the Royal Navy is to
guard the North Sea oil rigs.

468
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:03,461
The MOD says it's a prudent
precautionary measure.

469
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,094
- This time they are
playing with, at best,

470
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,764
the destruction of life as we know it,

471
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,600
and at worst, total annihilation.

472
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,520
You cannot win a nuclear war.

473
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,779
Now, just suppose the
Russians win this war.

474
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,324
What exactly would they be winning?

475
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,618
What would they have conquered?

476
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,537
Well, I'll tell you.

477
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,414
All major centers of population

478
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,792
and industry will have been destroyed.

479
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:43,626
- Industry?

480
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:44,544
What industry?

481
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,754
We ain't got no industry in Sheffield.

482
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,214
- Yes, and if the money hadn't...

483
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,512
If the money hadn't been
spent on nuclear weapons,

484
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:55,888
you'd have industry.

485
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,517
- Get back to bloody
Russia where you belong!

486
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,354
- Where's your red flag?

487
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,189
- We'd have put money into welfare,

488
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,568
we would have found
alternative sources of energy.

489
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,443
Industry...

490
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,156
Industry will have been destroyed,

491
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,742
oil refineries will have been destroyed,

492
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,494
all our water will have been polluted,

493
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,454
the soil will have been irradiated,

494
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,333
farm stock will be
dead, diseased or dying.

495
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,421
The Russians would have
conquered a corpse of a country.

496
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,423
- Let us pray.

497
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,849
- Our Father who art in heaven,

498
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,851
hallowed be thy name.

499
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,519
Thy kingdom come...

500
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,530
- Since the expiry
of the American ultimatum

501
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,367
to the Soviet Union at noon yesterday,

502
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,660
there have been intense diplomatic efforts

503
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,329
to mediate between the two countries.

504
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,290
There is still no
information from Iran itself.

505
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,125
No news teams have been allowed in or out

506
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,753
out of the country since
phone and telex links were cut

507
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,838
on Friday evening.

508
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,423
Questioned in the House this morning

509
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,466
the Foreign Secretary said

510
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,510
he had no definite news to report

511
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,428
and that it would be
unhelpful to speculate

512
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,641
in the absence of any hard
information from the area.

513
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,072
There's been a run on tinned food,

514
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,491
sugar and other storable items,

515
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,744
which is causing shortages in some areas.

516
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,413
A spokesman for the main supermarket chain

517
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,582
said that panic buying is unnecessary.

518
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,377
Fuel shortages are hindering
resupply in some areas,

519
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,296
but overall there is
no shortage of stocks.

520
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,383
They urge the public to calm down...

521
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,968
- 40p?

522
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,844
That's scandalous!

523
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,304
They were only 26p last week.

524
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,265
- You could always shop
somewhere else, you know,

525
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,182
if you're not satisfied.

526
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,809
- Honestly, there's a
national emergency going on

527
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,853
and all you can think about
is lining your pockets.

528
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,187
- Nobody's forcing you to buy 'em.

529
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,981
Put 'em back on the shelves,
if you don't want them.

530
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:52,815
- Yes, I will.

531
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,316
I'd sooner starve first.

532
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,735
Excuse me, love.

533
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,863
- They've started fighting, Mum.

534
00:28:59,155 --> 00:28:59,864
- Who has?

535
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,532
- The Americans and the Russians.

536
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,033
It's just been on the news.

537
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,203
My dad says you've got to come home now.

538
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,124
- Hey, you haven't
paid for them things.

539
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:15,880
- In response to today's news

540
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,965
of the outbreak of
hostilities between vessels

541
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,426
of the United States and Soviet navies,

542
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:21,802
a special session of Parliament

543
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,139
has this evening passed
an emergency powers act.

544
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,474
There will be a special announcement

545
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,184
at the end of this bulletin

546
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:32,104
and details will be given
then of how this affects you.

547
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,272
The Prime Minister is expected

548
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,483
to address the nation on
the international crisis

549
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,485
later this evening.

550
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,570
A statement issued earlier
from Downing Street

551
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,489
said the government is optimistic

552
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,158
that a peaceful negotiated
settlement to the conflict

553
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,159
is at hand.

554
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,744
In the meantime the public is urged

555
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,663
to remain calm and to continue normally.

556
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:50,748
- All right?

557
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,753
- Are you all right, love?

558
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:38,921
- It's noisy.

559
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,261
- It must be the pubs turning out.

560
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,819
- Nevertheless people are allowed

561
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,445
to think there is a lack of advice

562
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,614
or information from the government.

563
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,199
- The policy of the government is

564
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,742
quite clear on the matter.

565
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,828
We are urging people to keep calm.

566
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,454
- Doing a moonlight flit, then?

567
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,833
- No, we're going to our
Jack's in Lincolnshire

568
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,168
while things get sorted out.

569
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,087
I reckon we should be safer over there.

570
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,463
- Carol, will you stop messing about there

571
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,883
and come inside the house
and do something to help.

572
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:24,758
- Yeah.

573
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,219
- We'll not be safe
anywhere, as far as I see.

574
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,304
- I don't know.

575
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:29,972
We've a better chance of
surviving in the country,

576
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,849
really haven't we?

577
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:32,892
I mean where our Jack lives

578
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:36,145
there's only a row of houses and a pub.

579
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,063
I don't think they're gonna bomb that.

580
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,065
- I think that's about it, Ron.

581
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,317
- Mum!

582
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,234
- Carol!

583
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,569
- Have you turned that gas off?

584
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,112
- I hope so, we don't want
the whole street blowing up

585
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,155
while you're away.

586
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,573
- Come on, Carol.

587
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:48,407
- Spot!

588
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,408
I'm coming.

589
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,244
I can't find our Spot.

590
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,787
- Well he was here a
minute ago, wasn't he?

591
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,331
Have you looked inside the house?

592
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,291
- I've looked upstairs, along the street,

593
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,376
next door neighbor's garden, all over!

594
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,294
- It's ridiculous, all this.

595
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,211
Spot?

596
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:03,589
- Spot?

597
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,091
- He was here
a minute ago, honestly.

598
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:06,926
- Come on.

599
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,344
- He'll be here in a minute.

600
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:09,386
I know he will be.

601
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,013
Spot!

602
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,264
Come on!

603
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,059
- Come on, love.
- Spot!

604
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:18,354
- We're going without him.
- Oh, Mum, tell him.

605
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,647
Mum!

606
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:20,481
- Spot!

607
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,066
- You're being a right fool.

608
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,067
Nothing'll happen.

609
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,944
- Come on, we're not
standing about here all day

610
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:25,778
waiting for a bloody dog.

611
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,612
Get in.

612
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:27,446
- Don't be so cruel.

613
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,989
We can't leave him.

614
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,908
- Spot!
- Carol, get in.

615
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,742
Get in!

616
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,035
- Spot!

617
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:33,911
Spot!

618
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,788
Come on, Spot!

619
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,998
- Come on, get in there, bloody thing.

620
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,375
- The Russians
have cut the road links

621
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,835
into and out of West Berlin.

622
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,754
- See you, then, Bill.

623
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,006
- Let's hope so.

624
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,216
- Details are still coming in

625
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:50,511
but it seems an American army
convoy bound for West Berlin

626
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,388
has been turned back at Helmstedt

627
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,847
on the East German border.

628
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,308
Unconfirmed reports say
the Russians have offered

629
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,935
a safe passage out of the city

630
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,646
to the US, British and French garrisons.

631
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,356
It's not clear if this news is connected

632
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,608
with yesterday's riots in East Germany.

633
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,443
We'll bring you more details on the story

634
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,904
as soon as we have them.

635
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,380
- Sutton here.

636
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,056
Yes, I understand.

637
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,725
Do I have to go right away?

638
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:38,642
No?

639
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:39,560
When?

640
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,146
Yes, I see.

641
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,279
- Local authorities
have been given the power

642
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,573
to suspend certain peacetime functions

643
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,450
and to requisition premises

644
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,036
and materials for civil defense purposes.

645
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,370
A government spokesman said that

646
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,914
this was a precautionary move only.

647
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,417
It was not a cause for alarm.

648
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,700
- All right, love.

649
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,162
- Take your time.

650
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,916
- The AA and RAC have
reported heavy congestion

651
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,959
on roads up and down the country,

652
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,795
particularly those leading to Wales

653
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,546
and the West Country.

654
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,590
Police are urging motorists not to travel

655
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,760
unless absolutely necessary
and, if it is essential,

656
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,386
to use only minor roads

657
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,847
and leave motorways and
intercity trunk routes

658
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,225
clear for official traffic.

659
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,560
A full list of designated
essential service routes

660
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,772
is posted outside your local
authority headquarters.

661
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:10,025
It includes the M1, M18, A63 and A629.

662
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,766
- This is an
essential service route.

663
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,018
This is an essential service route.

664
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,188
Unless you have official
or essential business...

665
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,398
- We're trying to get
across to our relatives

666
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,483
in Lincolnshire.
- Not this way you're not.

667
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,277
Essential services only this road.

668
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,237
You'll have to find
another route I'm afraid.

669
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,363
- That's bloody ridiculous.

670
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,532
You can't stop people like that.

671
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,576
- Excuse me, where are you going?

672
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,703
Sorry, love, you can't...

673
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,997
- You just can't stop people.
- Tell you what.

674
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:07,332
Try Junction 35/36 of the M1.

675
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,292
They've opened up the hard shoulder

676
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,377
for single line traffic only.

677
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,171
It'll be chock-a-block.

678
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,047
If I were you I'd go home and sit tight.

679
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,551
That's what they're advising people to do.

680
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:21,722
- This route is for
essential traffic only.

681
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,602
- There's growing evidence
overnight from scientists

682
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,562
and observers in many countries

683
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,731
that there have been
two nuclear explosions

684
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,065
in the Middle East.

685
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,734
There's no official confirmation of what

686
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,069
has happened and the
Foreign Office in London--

687
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,363
- I've put half a dozen in.

688
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,199
I can fetch some more if you like.

689
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,284
- No, that'll be plenty.

690
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,663
Well, tell him to improvise, then.

691
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:47,581
Right.

692
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,669
- Clive, you don't think anything's really

693
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:53,879
going to happen, do you?

694
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:57,633
- No, it's just a precaution that's all.

695
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,552
- Have you had a shave this morning?

696
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,471
You should never have said you'd do it.

697
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,473
You don't have to.

698
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,017
You won't get the sack if you refuse.

699
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,438
- Look, Marjorie, it's difficult
for me as well, you know.

700
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,816
I don't want to go and
leave you and the children.

701
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,444
- Well, then, why are you going?

702
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,738
- Somebody's got to
pick up the pieces if...

703
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,616
Why didn't you say something before

704
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,035
if you were worried about it?

705
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:29,498
You never said anything when
I went on those courses.

706
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,582
Sutton here.

707
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,542
- Unconfirmed reports...

708
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,128
- Yes, in half an hour's time.

709
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,380
I should be going off now, if I were you.

710
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,007
The roads will be getting busy.

711
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,469
Well, use your common sense, man.

712
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,429
How should I know?

713
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,223
Marjorie, leave that.

714
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,184
I'll ring you later.

715
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:51,770
What?

716
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,316
Yes.

717
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:58,568
Yes.

718
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:04,574
- It is imperative, while
there is still time left,

719
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,577
that the TUC call a general strike

720
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,915
in protest against this
disaster which faces us all.

721
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,505
- That's what'll destroy this country!

722
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,717
- There is still time to avert disaster

723
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,386
if we act resolutely and show

724
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,681
both the Russians and the Americans

725
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:32,144
that we will have no truck
with their warmongering.

726
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,521
- What about the Falklands?

727
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,814
- What about the Falklands?

728
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,191
Listen mate, there's nobody
more patriotic than I am.

729
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,943
I've been trying to get us
out of the Common Market

730
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,194
for bloody years!

731
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:44,531
But first...

732
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,333
Please do not play into their hands.

733
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,711
This is a peaceful demonstration.

734
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:01,965
We are exercising our
right of free speech.

735
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:06,636
The police have no right
to stop this demonstration.

736
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,598
Do not play into their hands.

737
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,724
You have no...

738
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,858
- Tin openers!

739
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,485
£1.50 a go.

740
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,195
Come on, all of you.

741
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,239
£1.50 could save your life!

742
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:00,524
- Morning, Clive.
- Morning, Alan.

743
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:01,858
What's it like in there?

744
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,818
- It's a bit primitive.

745
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,735
Take a look.

746
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,904
- We'll get it organized.

747
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:08,281
Where the hell is everyone?

748
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,366
There's only half of them here.

749
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,159
- You know Steve, the Information Officer?

750
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,702
- Where the hell is everybody?

751
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,788
- Jeff just rang and says
his car's broken down.

752
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,622
- That's no good, is it?

753
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,416
How many missing?
- About 10.

754
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,250
- Get on the phone.

755
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,043
Tell them I want 'em here immediately.

756
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,046
Which is my desk?
- Straight through.

757
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,923
- Mind your head.

758
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,175
- I don't see any sign of the
Emergency Committee, do you?

759
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,262
- You know what those
bloody councilors are like.

760
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,972
- They're not getting paid
for this, aren't they?

761
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,433
- This is it, this is the best I could do.

762
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,518
- Dr. Talbot, Regional Health Authority.

763
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,394
- How are things going?

764
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,187
- We're doing our best.

765
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,439
- In the last few days,

766
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,107
emergency headquarters like this

767
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,651
have been hastily improvised
up and down the country

768
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,238
in the basements of town
halls and civic centers.

769
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,788
- The time has now
come to make everything ready

770
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,834
for you and your family in
case an air attack happens.

771
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,420
This does not mean that
war is bound to come,

772
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:04,921
but there is a risk of this

773
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,048
and we must all be prepared for it.

774
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,724
When you hear the attack warning,

775
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:20,145
you and your family
must take cover at once.

776
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,314
Do not stay out of doors.

777
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:27,903
If you are caught in the open, lie down.

778
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,784
- Can you pass us that...

779
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,329
- If you leave your home,

780
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:41,917
your local authority may take
it over for homeless families,

781
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:45,003
and if you move, the
authorities in the new place

782
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,838
will not help you with food,

783
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,758
accommodation or other essentials.

784
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,346
You are better off in your own home.

785
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,932
Stay there.

786
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:57,158
- If anyone dies while you are kept

787
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,244
in your fall-out room,

788
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:03,039
move the body to another
room in the house,

789
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,126
label the body with name and address

790
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,877
and cover it as tightly as possible

791
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,298
in polythene, paper, sheets or blankets.

792
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,343
If, however, you have had a body

793
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,555
in the house for more than five days

794
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:21,808
and if it is safe to go outside,

795
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,145
then you should bury the body
for the time being in a trench

796
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,816
or cover it with earth and
mark the spot of the burial.

797
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:52,922
Here are some ideas for
making your inner refuge.

798
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:57,594
One: make a lean-to with
sloping doors or strong boards

799
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:59,846
rested against an inner wall.

800
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,765
- You all right, love?

801
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,560
- I've just been sick again.

802
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,648
Oh, I feel awful.

803
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,108
I think I'll go back to bed.

804
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,068
- Don't worry about it, love.

805
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,528
It'll only last for a week or two.

806
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,446
- No.

807
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,323
- Partly close the two open ends

808
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:22,369
with boxes of earth or
sand or heavy furniture.

809
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,413
- I'll ring work for you and
tell them you're not coming in.

810
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:26,956
- If anybody's there.

811
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,709
There were only one or two in yesterday.

812
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:30,835
- It's worse than before.

813
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,004
I can't get anything now.

814
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:35,757
The line's dead.

815
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,472
- I think we ought
to be getting the rest

816
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,558
of the things out of the cellar now.

817
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,563
- The time has now come to make

818
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,524
everything ready for you and your family

819
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,318
in case an air attack happens.

820
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,821
This does not mean that
war is bound to come,

821
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,280
but there is a risk of this

822
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,951
and we must all be prepared for it.

823
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,036
When you hear the attack warning,

824
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,457
you and your family
must take cover at once.

825
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,626
Do not stay out of doors.

826
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:13,461
- Hello, County.

827
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,879
This is Sheffield District.

828
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,716
Testing, one, two, three, four.

829
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,467
Please report my signal.

830
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:20,552
Over.

831
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:21,803
- Whose bloody responsibility is it then?

832
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,805
We've all got families.

833
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,850
Look, just get down here.

834
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,101
There's nine other people.

835
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,854
- I've got a serious public order problem.

836
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:34,441
I need at least an extra six PSUs.

837
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:35,775
Yeah, but when?

838
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:40,697
Look, I'm using traffic wardens already.

839
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:41,614
- Many of these officers

840
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,867
have had no training at all.

841
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,702
Some have learned of their emergency role

842
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:48,413
only in the last few days and almost all

843
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,249
are unsure of their exact duties.

844
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,921
- I suppose I ought to
take this one off as well.

845
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:57,756
- You what?

846
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:58,757
It'll get scratched to pieces.

847
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,467
It's only just been painted, Bill.

848
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,510
- Better than getting
blown to pieces, innit?

849
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:03,470
- Shall I go to school then, Mum?

850
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:04,637
I'm gonna be late.

851
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:05,472
- I don't know.

852
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:06,806
What did it say on the telly?

853
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,892
I can't remember whether it
said schools were closed or no.

854
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,310
- Oh yeah, closed.

855
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:11,227
It said so on the news.

856
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,520
We're ought to stay at home.

857
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,522
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

858
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,316
They said they're sending notes out.

859
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,151
- Is there time?
- Great.

860
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,278
I had a history test this morning.

861
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,988
- Alison, go down to Kirby's

862
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,615
and see if they've got any food left.

863
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,366
- Like what?
- Anything.

864
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,702
Bread, tinned stuff, bring what you can.

865
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:28,620
And take my purse.

866
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,789
- Dad, you gonna build
one of these in here?

867
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,123
- Over my dead body.

868
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,792
I want to know something
more definite, Bill,

869
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,795
before we ripping this place to pieces.

870
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,463
- Can I help you?
- Here, hold that.

871
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:39,964
- It'll be great.

872
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,758
We'll be able to sleep in it.

873
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,135
It'll be like going camping.

874
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:48,139
- The most widespread
danger is fall-out.

875
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,142
Fall-out is dust that is sucked up

876
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,978
from the ground by the explosion.

877
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,481
Fall-out can kill.

878
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,361
It's 8:30am.

879
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,822
3:30 in the morning in Washington.

880
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,698
Over the past four days
neither the President

881
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,242
nor his senior staff will have had

882
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,452
more than a few hours' rest.

883
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,454
This is when they may be asleep

884
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:15,375
this is when Western
response will be slowest.

885
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,176
- As we expected nearly
all the supermarket shelves

886
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,720
are empty, but we've managed
to get the warehouses

887
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,014
controlled by the police.

888
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,975
As yet we haven't located all the

889
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:34,602
root vegetable clumps on local farms,

890
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,856
but stocks of sugar,
wheat, flour and rice...

891
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,150
- Attack warning red.

892
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,027
- Attack warning.
- Is it for real?

893
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,196
- Attack warning, it's for bloody real.

894
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,198
- Get to your stations.

895
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,118
Get that generator going!

896
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,452
Lock the doors.

897
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,455
- As soon as you can, every single scrap

898
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,499
of information you've got on casualties.

899
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,917
I must have those.

900
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:01,713
- Get your heads down.

901
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,464
- Look, we can't sell you any timber.

902
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,174
You'll have to see the boss about it.

903
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,719
It's a bloody joinery, not a timber yard.

904
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,512
You can't just have a piece of that.

905
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,019
Come on, quick.

906
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:16,936
Get down.

907
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,441
- These have gone.

908
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,026
Everything's dead.
- What about the tellies?

909
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,111
- Why didn't you pull
the bloody aerial out?

910
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,656
- Get the standbys working.

911
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:10,490
Come on.

912
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,427
- Bloody hell.

913
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,513
- Hold on, Gordon.

914
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:34,973
You're going too fast.

915
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:07,880
- Come on!

916
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,883
That might just be the start of it.

917
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,643
- Jesus Christ, they've done it.

918
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,441
They've done it.

919
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:29,777
Where are you going?

920
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,070
- I'm driving to Ruth's.

921
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,072
See if she's all right.

922
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:36,826
Oh, shit.

923
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,921
- Come on, move it inside.

924
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,339
- What about all these?

925
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,216
- That's all right.
- That's wrong.

926
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:53,051
Come on, get it off.

927
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:54,510
We gotta get the mattress on the bottom.

928
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,511
- That's right.

929
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,305
- OK, roll it, put it down there.

930
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,098
- Where's our Alison?

931
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,058
- Build it up.

932
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,268
- This one's on Finningley.

933
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,439
- A brown burst.
- Four-three.

934
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,900
- What was the other power station?

935
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:09,734
- Hang on.

936
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:13,279
There's something on the airport, I think.

937
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,417
- Shine the torch further down.

938
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:31,589
Ruth, come down here and give us a hand.

939
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,634
Ruth, come and help your grandma!

940
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,844
- Ruth, please!

941
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,228
It'll be all right, it's falling out.

942
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,479
Come on.

943
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,438
All this stuff on.

944
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,273
Come on, put that on.

945
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,692
Come on, then.

946
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:55,279
Ruth!

947
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,867
Come on.

948
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:18,261
- Michael!

949
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,178
Michael!

950
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,397
- Take it easy, don't hurry.

951
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,778
Ah, that's the girl, well done.

952
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,613
It won't be long now.

953
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,701
Well done, Gordon.

954
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,744
How long can you keep that going?

955
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,162
- Two weeks if we're careful.

956
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,540
- First-aid kit, quickly.

957
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,376
We've lost County again, I think.

958
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:56,836
Aerials must have blown.

959
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,005
They were on the roof.

960
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,257
Switch the lights off when you get there.

961
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,092
Can we raise any districts?

962
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,510
What about the radio amps?

963
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,678
Can we improvise an aerial?

964
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:06,512
- We'll try.

965
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,848
- Let's do something quick.

966
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,392
- Where the hell's the first-aid kit?

967
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,894
- It's on this shelf at the back.

968
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:14,895
- I've looked out here.

969
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,814
I can't shift a thing.

970
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:19,775
- How is he?

971
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,527
- I can't find the first-aid kit.

972
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:22,445
- Forget the first-aid kit.

973
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,865
Bring me something to cover him up with.

974
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,050
- There.
- No!

975
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:45,843
Leave me.

976
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,558
- Please.

977
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,143
- Help!
- Somebody!

978
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:09,867
- Everybody all right?

979
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,203
Mother?

980
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,161
- Let me out of here in this dark!

981
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,705
- Jesus Christ, another one.

982
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,125
- This could go on for ever.

983
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,882
It's Stocksbridge police.

984
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,467
What about rescue?

985
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,387
Is there anything you can do?

986
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,555
Over.

987
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,014
- Give me another bin liner.

988
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,936
- What is your RADIAC reading?

989
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,729
- What about the depot?

990
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,691
- I repeat, what
is your RADIAC reading?

991
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:24,608
Over.

992
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:26,986
- 100.
- 100.

993
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:29,738
It's too high.

994
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,283
You've got to get your men under cover.

995
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,828
Can you get us through

996
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:39,415
to the County Central Headquarters?

997
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:40,332
Over.

998
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:42,626
Can you patch us through?

999
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:43,544
Over.

1000
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,006
Stocksbridge, are you receiving me?

1001
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,340
Over.

1002
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,425
- Green, I think.

1003
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,135
- Have you heard anything from them?

1004
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,219
- Never mind about that.

1005
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,679
Ask if they've got casualties.

1006
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,767
- They've lost them.

1007
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,855
- What about Hillsborough
and Stocksbridge?

1008
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,190
- Nothing from Hillsborough,

1009
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,900
but Stocksbridge not too bad.

1010
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:09,278
Windows blown in and structural
damage but not too bad.

1011
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,696
- Wind has blown in that far out?

1012
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,364
Jesus Christ!

1013
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,325
- Ask him where the last one was.

1014
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:17,828
- Switch that thing off, will you Gordon.

1015
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,125
- The first fall-out
dust settles on Sheffield.

1016
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,253
It's an hour and 25
minutes after the attack.

1017
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,172
An explosion on the ground at Crewe

1018
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:31,634
has sucked up this debris
and made it radioactive.

1019
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:34,261
The wind has blown it here.

1020
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,554
This level of attack has broken

1021
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,932
most of the windows in Britain.

1022
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,142
Many roofs are open to the sky.

1023
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,895
Some of the lethal dust gets in.

1024
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,776
In these early stages, the
symptoms of radiation sickness

1025
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:52,196
and the symptoms of panic are identical.

1026
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,218
- You all right, Ruth?

1027
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:16,929
Ruth?

1028
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,890
- I couldn't help it.

1029
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,308
It just came on.

1030
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,228
- Don't worry about it, love.

1031
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,437
It's not your fault.

1032
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,564
We've all got it.

1033
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,066
- I know, but I'm so ashamed.

1034
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:33,195
Messing the bed at my age.
- It's the shock, isn't it?

1035
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,447
- It's like being a little baby again.

1036
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,448
- Lie down.

1037
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:40,369
Come and help me clean Grandma.

1038
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:41,912
Ruth, be careful with that, love.

1039
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,039
You don't know long it's
gonna have to last us.

1040
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:48,294
- Ruth, don't just sit
there, do something for once.

1041
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:54,842
- Oh!

1042
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:55,759
Urgh!

1043
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,893
- Michael.

1044
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,272
Michael, I've got to find him, Bill.

1045
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:12,526
- You stop here
and I'll go and look for him.

1046
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,487
You stop here.

1047
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,198
I'll only be out a few minutes.

1048
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,035
Stop here, love.
- No, I've got to come.

1049
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:21,952
No.

1050
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,788
- Help me.
- All right.

1051
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:29,585
Oh, my God.

1052
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,966
Michael?

1053
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,426
Michael?

1054
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,758
- We haven't heard
from County HQ for two days.

1055
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,428
- Who the hell else have you tried?

1056
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,055
- All of
them, but nothing back yet.

1057
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,099
- Send another motorcycle.

1058
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:27,351
- There are no roads left.

1059
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:28,894
- All the people here
will be dead already.

1060
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,854
It's completely flattened.

1061
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,856
Round here 50% would still be alive

1062
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,235
but here they're as good as dead already.

1063
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:40,155
They've probably received a lethal dose.

1064
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,657
- What about here?

1065
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:42,908
- It'll be pretty heavy there.

1066
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,328
If the wind's still blowing
out from the west, southwest

1067
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,997
it's in direct line from Crewe.

1068
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,377
800 rads, 1,000, difficult to say.

1069
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,547
Depends what sort of cover
they've built of course.

1070
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:00,801
If they've got a decent cellar
we'll get it on the radio.

1071
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,851
- There's no way of getting anything out.

1072
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:10,144
I'm calling--

1073
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:11,145
Listen.

1074
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,146
- Yeah.

1075
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,857
Yes, I'll pass the message on.

1076
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,316
- What am I expected to do?

1077
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:22,239
- I can't get anything out, can I?

1078
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:23,157
- Listen.

1079
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,033
Hey!

1080
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,036
I've got a message from
Rivelin Valley police.

1081
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,415
They've managed to get
through to BGIF works depot.

1082
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,417
They've got some vehicles on the road

1083
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,544
but they're nearly out of fuel.

1084
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:37,963
- What the hell have they
been doing with it all?

1085
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,214
They didn't tell me.

1086
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,048
They just said,

1087
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,885
they want to know where
they can get some more.

1088
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:46,096
And they've got no food.
- Oh, God.

1089
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,600
- I've got--
- Let me get on with it, OK?

1090
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,591
- Here you are, Mother.

1091
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,760
Something to eat for you.

1092
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,890
Better leave her, the rest'll do her good.

1093
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,309
- At least it won't go cold.

1094
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:36,104
- Ruth.

1095
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,192
Ruth, love.

1096
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:40,984
Come on, love.

1097
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,695
You'll have to eat something.

1098
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,780
But you'll have to, love.

1099
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,698
It's not just you now, you know.

1100
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,284
The baby needs some food as well.

1101
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,118
Come on.

1102
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,579
- I don't care about this baby any more.

1103
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,164
- Oh, Ruth.
- I wish it was dead.

1104
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,874
- Don't say things like that.

1105
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,294
- There's no point with Jimmy dead.

1106
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,088
- But you don't know.
- He is.

1107
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,465
He is, I know he is.

1108
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,467
- You can't be certain.

1109
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:10,013
- We're breathing in all
this radiation all the time.

1110
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:10,931
My baby.

1111
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,936
It will be ugly and deformed.

1112
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:28,115
- Oh, Michael.

1113
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:29,616
Alison and Jimmy.

1114
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,869
All of them gone.

1115
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:36,498
Alison...

1116
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,042
Michael...

1117
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,212
All dead.

1118
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,046
- No.

1119
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,715
We don't know that.

1120
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,218
They might be safe somewhere.

1121
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,555
- I wish I were dead.

1122
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:53,932
I wish it were me.

1123
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:05,444
- I wish I could swap places with him.

1124
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,325
- Right, let's get in.

1125
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,410
Watch that bloody water.

1126
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,707
How far does this go back?

1127
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:20,542
- It's bloody four floors
have come down on this,

1128
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,712
it could go back for yards and yards.

1129
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,509
- Try it again, Gordon.

1130
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,137
Still nothing coming through.

1131
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,932
It must be blocked further up.

1132
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,309
- How much stuff do you
think's on top of us?

1133
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,937
- Most of the
town hall, I should think.

1134
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:41,897
- When will you be able to get to us?

1135
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:43,690
- I can't get
the lifting gear through.

1136
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,692
- What about the army?
- There's no way through.

1137
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,361
The roads are all blocked.

1138
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:48,737
- We've not heard from County.

1139
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,072
- If we don't hear from some soon,

1140
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,282
we'll never get things under control.

1141
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,493
- You try getting through to them.

1142
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:55,535
It's bloody useless.

1143
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,537
- I've got starving mobs
in Shallow, Echofield--

1144
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,582
- Look, it's not our decision anyway.

1145
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,250
It's up to Zone to authorize

1146
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,460
the release of buffer stocks

1147
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:04,836
and then it becomes a County decision.

1148
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,296
- We can't get through to County.

1149
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:07,381
- What are we going to do?

1150
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:08,548
Let them starve?

1151
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,133
- Look, even if we did
have the authority--

1152
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:10,968
- We're on our own.

1153
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:11,802
You've got the authority.

1154
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:13,637
It's about bloody time
you did something with it.

1155
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,097
- Look, what's the point of wasting food

1156
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,140
on people who are going to die anyway?

1157
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,475
- I agree with Clive.

1158
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,268
The food stocks are not gonna last long.

1159
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,312
A lot of people just didn't stock up.

1160
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,146
- How could they?

1161
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,314
The bloody shops were empty.

1162
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,983
- Now they're coming out of the shelters.

1163
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,276
I know it sounds callous but
I think we should hang on

1164
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:29,486
to the little food we've got.

1165
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:32,948
- I need that food to
force people to work.

1166
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,743
- There's about 2,000
outside Roxburgh fire station.

1167
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,453
- Make us a cup of tea, Sharon.

1168
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,287
- Come with we, you suffering.

1169
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,748
I'm not your bloody wife.

1170
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,458
- Anybody got a fag?

1171
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,549
- Bad for your health, innit?

1172
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,676
- They're
pulling the place apart.

1173
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:55,303
- Look, I don't care how
much trouble they're causing.

1174
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,139
We're not sending our men
in there with radiation

1175
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:58,890
as high as that.

1176
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,309
Look, I know that but what's the point?

1177
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,979
They're all gonna die
on that patch anyway.

1178
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,398
- Bill, just get me a drink.

1179
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,735
Please, a drink.

1180
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,654
- I'll see if I can find anything.

1181
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:19,870
I won't be long.

1182
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,296
- Just a minute.

1183
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,547
Just a minute.

1184
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:26,520
For God's sake.
- Just a minute, love.

1185
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:27,437
That's it.

1186
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:30,315
- Oh, God.

1187
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:32,609
Look at it.
- Just a minute.

1188
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,069
Just a minute.

1189
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,320
Just a minute.

1190
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,203
- Can you run this?

1191
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:44,079
That's it.

1192
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:46,414
- All right, put her down here, mate.

1193
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,542
Put her down here.

1194
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,961
Give us one of the blankets.

1195
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:54,840
Come on.

1196
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:56,716
Oh, my God.

1197
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,098
- Ruth?

1198
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,100
- Ruth!

1199
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,102
- Ruth!

1200
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:18,780
Come on, down you go.

1201
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,158
Careful.

1202
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,066
- Radiation levels
are still dangerous.

1203
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,277
Residents of Release Band A,

1204
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:00,530
that is Woodspring, North
Pathway and Abbey Dale,

1205
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,324
should not go from their shelters

1206
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,534
for more than two hours per day.

1207
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,536
Residents of Release Band B,

1208
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,581
that is Neveredge and Broomhill,

1209
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,292
no longer than one hour per day.

1210
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,590
- Mandy!

1211
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,508
Mandy!

1212
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,303
Have you see our Mandy?

1213
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,055
Mandy!

1214
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,849
Mandy!

1215
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:10,767
- Mum!

1216
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:12,894
Mum!

1217
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:14,813
Mum!

1218
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:16,898
Mum!

1219
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,441
Mum!

1220
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:19,359
Mum!

1221
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,338
- What time is it?

1222
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:06,633
- Half past two.

1223
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:11,012
- Night or day?

1224
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,473
- Night, I think.

1225
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:15,809
I'm not sure.

1226
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,310
I'm losing track.

1227
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:22,774
I'm not sure whether it's
night or day any more.

1228
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:00,812
- Hanging in the
atmosphere, the clouds of debris

1229
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:04,023
shut out the sun's heat and light.

1230
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:06,484
Across large areas of
the Northern Hemisphere

1231
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:10,321
it starts to get dark,
it starts to get cold.

1232
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:13,324
In the centers of large land masses

1233
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:14,951
like America or Russia,

1234
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,120
the temperature drop may be severe,

1235
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:20,415
as much as 25 degrees centigrade.

1236
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,959
Even in Britain, within days of the attack

1237
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:27,213
it could fall to freezing or
below for long, dark periods.

1238
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,305
- Go back to your homes.

1239
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:20,642
Allocation of foodstuffs
will begin shortly.

1240
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:23,978
The distribution points will be announced.

1241
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,563
I repeat, go home.

1242
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,942
There is nothing we can do.

1243
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:31,528
We have no authority to distribute food.

1244
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,571
- Who are you saving it for?

1245
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,615
- This is a warning.

1246
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:37,158
Any attempt to appropriate provisions

1247
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,954
from these premises will be met by force.

1248
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:45,583
I advise you to disperse
and go back to your homes.

1249
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:51,965
Prepare to fire gas.

1250
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,684
One round CS gas, straight at gates.

1251
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,817
One round at that man.

1252
01:16:54,444 --> 01:16:55,987
- The entire peacetime resources of

1253
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,865
the British Health Service,
even if they survived,

1254
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,450
would be unable to cope with the effects

1255
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:04,287
of even the single bomb
that's hit Sheffield.

1256
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,357
- Rosie!

1257
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:33,274
Rosie!

1258
01:17:34,484 --> 01:17:35,234
Diane!

1259
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,144
- Listen...

1260
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:52,145
- By this time, without
drugs, water or bandages,

1261
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:55,273
without electricity or
medical support facilities,

1262
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:59,193
there is virtually no way a
doctor can exercise his skill.

1263
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,154
As a source of help or comfort,

1264
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:05,408
he is little better equipped
than the nearest survivor.

1265
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,417
- Ma!

1266
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:15,334
Da!

1267
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,570
- We've no
choice, as far as I see.

1268
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,572
- Can't we get
any food from outside?

1269
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:45,907
- Where from?

1270
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,575
We've told County and
everybody's in the same boat,

1271
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,202
aren't they?
- What about the broilers?

1272
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:51,078
- Trouble is we can't contact
Rockley or Haresbrook,

1273
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,914
God knows what's happened there.

1274
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:54,999
- Probably been raided.

1275
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,376
- What do you think, Doctor?

1276
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,128
- We'll have to cut their rations.

1277
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,047
I've worked it out.

1278
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:05,092
1,000 calories for manual
workers and 500 for the rest.

1279
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,385
- 500?

1280
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:07,303
500?

1281
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,515
That wouldn't keep a flea alive.

1282
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,308
- Should we be bothering
to keep anybody alive

1283
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,518
if they can't work?

1284
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:17,104
- A lot of people are gonna die anyway.

1285
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:20,274
Back to survival of
the fittest, I suppose.

1286
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:24,570
- What is that in terms of
food, then, 500 calories?

1287
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,239
- I don't know.

1288
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:29,075
A few slices of bread, some soup.

1289
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,578
A lamb chop, a treacle tart,

1290
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,374
a few pints of beer.

1291
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:41,587
Bastards!

1292
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:46,092
- Look, you must have an empty factory

1293
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,302
somewhere to put them.
- No, you look.

1294
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,054
I've got thousands of
homeless bloody people

1295
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,264
up there walking around.

1296
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:52,723
I've got enough on with them

1297
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,642
without worrying about bloody criminals.

1298
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,978
- You're gonna have to find
somewhere to put 'em, aren't ya?

1299
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,521
- Well, I don't know.

1300
01:20:58,813 --> 01:20:59,689
Look, shoot the buggers.

1301
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:00,857
I don't care.

1302
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,569
- Can we get a
water tank to Broomhill?

1303
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:06,654
The standpipe's run dry.

1304
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,700
- Oh, Christ, Steve.

1305
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:13,119
This should have been sorted out days ago.

1306
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:13,953
- What about the rest centers?

1307
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:15,663
Can we not tell them to
make their way there?

1308
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,290
- No, no, there'll be no point.

1309
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:19,542
They'll be overrun anyway.

1310
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,045
- What about tents?

1311
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:25,298
Got any tents we could use?

1312
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,340
- Tents?

1313
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,718
How the hell should I know?

1314
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,011
Look, if you want to know about tents,

1315
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:32,638
go and phone the bloody Boy Scouts.

1316
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,056
- Piss off, will you?

1317
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,600
You're not the only one under pressure.

1318
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:36,809
- I bloody know!

1319
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,060
- You sort it!

1320
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:41,272
- And what the hell are you
doing about digging us out?

1321
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:42,815
That's what I'd like to know.

1322
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,397
- Bloody hell, what a stink.

1323
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:24,565
Let's get out of here.

1324
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,567
- I'm gonna puke.

1325
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,707
- Halt or I'll fire.

1326
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:45,711
Number three, a round
for that man over there.

1327
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:50,591
Number one, go and search the house.

1328
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:51,676
Up against the wall.

1329
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:52,885
- We weren't doing anything.

1330
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,887
- Did you even know the
penalty for looting?

1331
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,138
- We aren't looting.
- Quiet!

1332
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,307
- Searching empty houses.
- Shut up!

1333
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,309
- What choice have we got?
- We were hungry.

1334
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:01,602
- What else can we do, eh?

1335
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,813
We're starving!
- Two bodies in the cellar.

1336
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:04,855
A man and a woman.

1337
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,732
Not been dead long, the
man's head's battered in.

1338
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:07,984
- It were like that when we went in.

1339
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:09,610
- It weren't us, it were him.

1340
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:10,403
- Out.

1341
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:11,862
- We ain't done nothing.

1342
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:15,199
- Number two, pick up the stolen goods.

1343
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,376
- We were only after a bit of food.

1344
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:28,587
- Check the house and search the body.

1345
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:36,095
- Bag of crisps.
- What flavor are they?

1346
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:37,596
- Prawn cocktail.

1347
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:38,514
- They fucking would be.

1348
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:39,598
I hate them.

1349
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:40,516
Come on.

1350
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,073
- All able-bodied citizens,

1351
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:57,533
men, women and children,

1352
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,577
should report for reconstruction duties

1353
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,955
commencing 0800 hours tomorrow morning.

1354
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,416
The inhabitants of Release Band F,

1355
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,043
that is Dore and Totley,

1356
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,836
Abbeydale and Woodseats,

1357
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:11,464
should rendezvous in Abbeydale Park.

1358
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:13,674
Release Band B, that is...

1359
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,677
- Money has had no
meaning since the attack.

1360
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,096
The only viable currency is food,

1361
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:23,476
given as reward for work
or withheld as punishment.

1362
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:25,603
In the grim economics of the aftermath,

1363
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:28,022
there are two harsh realities.

1364
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:29,315
A survivor who can work

1365
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:31,400
gets more food than one who can't

1366
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:35,654
and the more who die, the more
food is left for the rest.

1367
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:51,170
- I could murder a fag now.

1368
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:54,090
I used to love a fag after a meal.

1369
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:58,052
- Have you got owt to swap?

1370
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,680
- I've got some Scotch.

1371
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:13,400
- Ohh.

1372
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,485
Bloody hell.

1373
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,671
- Detention camps are improvised

1374
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,757
to cope with looters.

1375
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:01,467
Their numbers are growing.

1376
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,639
- Let me out!

1377
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:08,057
- Bastard!

1378
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:11,018
- Let him out!

1379
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:14,313
Fucking full of yourself
like a traffic warden!

1380
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:15,314
Let us out!

1381
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:24,365
- Come on.

1382
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:27,826
Watch yourselves here, lads.
- Right.

1383
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,371
- Get that light down here quick.

1384
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:31,538
- Watch the girder.

1385
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:32,456
Come on.

1386
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,975
- Over here.
- Another one here.

1387
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:53,018
- Another one over there.

1388
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,895
- How many altogether?

1389
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,773
- About four, five, six.

1390
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,618
- A growing exodus from
cities in search of food.

1391
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:33,535
It's July.

1392
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:36,497
The countryside is cold
and full of unknown

1393
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:38,082
radiation hazards.

1394
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,919
By now, five to six
weeks after the attack,

1395
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,796
deaths from the effects of fall-out

1396
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:46,256
are approaching their peak.

1397
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:40,769
- Return to your homes.

1398
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,105
Return to your homes.

1399
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,111
Return to your homes.

1400
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:51,238
Turn back.

1401
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,073
Turn back.

1402
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,296
- Right, down there.

1403
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:16,388
Come on.

1404
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:29,443
- George Langley?

1405
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:30,277
- Yes, what do you want?

1406
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:31,987
- You've been designated
four temporary residents.

1407
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:34,615
- I'm having no strangers
coming to live here.

1408
01:31:34,907 --> 01:31:35,741
- You've no choice in the matter.

1409
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:36,909
It's law under the new emergency--

1410
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:38,494
- I don't care what it is.

1411
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:41,079
This is my house and I'm
having no strangers in it.

1412
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:43,332
- According to my records
you've got four spare rooms...

1413
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,251
- Aye, and they're stopping spare and all.

1414
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,129
They can't just walk into people's houses.

1415
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:50,088
It's not right.

1416
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:50,923
- Look we're not here to argue

1417
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:52,716
the rights and wrongs of the matter.

1418
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:53,550
Right, you four.
- Beside.

1419
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:55,093
- It's bloody dangerous.

1420
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:58,388
They might bring all sorts
of diseases with them.

1421
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,016
- Come on, in you go.
- They might be contaminated.

1422
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:02,392
- Well, look at him.

1423
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,268
Look at him.

1424
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,271
Oi look at him.
- Go on, in you go.

1425
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:11,610
- Right, Number 19.

1426
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,575
- Get out, will you?

1427
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:21,328
The whole lot of you. Go on!

1428
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,413
- You've no right just to throw--

1429
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,672
- Get out, the whole lot of you!

1430
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:32,965
- Where are we supposed to go?

1431
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:36,552
- Yeah, where are we supposed to go?

1432
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:47,980
- This is a final warning.

1433
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:50,190
Residents and non-residents
must register...

1434
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:51,358
- Ruth?

1435
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:54,486
It is Ruth, isn't it?

1436
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,072
I'm Bob.

1437
01:32:58,282 --> 01:32:59,283
Jimmy's mate.

1438
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:04,288
We met once or twice, remember?

1439
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:09,293
You came to our last Christmas do at work.

1440
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:15,465
Where is he?

1441
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:18,802
Is he with you?

1442
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:21,138
Have you seen him?

1443
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,764
- No provisions will be issued

1444
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,891
to anyone without them.

1445
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,961
- Is it safe to eat?
- I don't know.

1446
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:54,463
How can you tell?

1447
01:33:57,591 --> 01:33:58,383
It's got a thick coat.

1448
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,427
That should have protected it.

1449
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,180
- You breathe it in, though, don't you?

1450
01:34:03,472 --> 01:34:05,349
- It should be all right.

1451
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:09,227
- Sheep don't die of cold.

1452
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,063
It must be radiation.

1453
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:15,817
- You'd be able to taste
it if it were contaminated.

1454
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:17,694
- Oh, I don't know.

1455
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,071
- We've no choice, have we,

1456
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:21,990
unless we want to starve to death?

1457
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:25,202
- Oh.

1458
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:42,886
- I'll take some with me.

1459
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:43,804
- Where?

1460
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:47,641
- City.

1461
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,230
- There's nothing there.

1462
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:00,654
- North.

1463
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:02,906
Dales.

1464
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:09,996
Doesn't really matter, does it?

1465
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:13,417
It's all the same.

1466
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,007
I'll try and skin it.

1467
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:23,802
Keep me warm.

1468
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:34,915
- If we are to survive
these difficult early months

1469
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,583
and establish a firm base

1470
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,502
for the redevelopment of our country,

1471
01:36:38,794 --> 01:36:40,587
then we must concentrate all our energies

1472
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:42,923
on agricultural production.

1473
01:36:57,479 --> 01:36:59,523
- Collecting this
diminished first harvest

1474
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:02,526
is now literally a
matter of life and death.

1475
01:37:57,998 --> 01:37:59,374
Chronic fuel shortages mean that

1476
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:01,126
this could be one of the last times

1477
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:05,380
tractors and combine
harvesters are used in Britain.

1478
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:54,150
- The first winter.

1479
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,988
The stresses of hypothermia,
epidemic and radiation

1480
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,117
fall heavily on the
very young and the old.

1481
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:05,370
Their protective layers
of flesh are thinner.

1482
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:06,704
In the first few winters,

1483
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:10,875
many of the young and old
disappear from Britain.

1484
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:26,975
- Halt.

1485
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:30,186
If you do not halt, we will open fire.

1486
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:32,313
Halt at once.

1487
01:42:44,409 --> 01:42:45,160
- No!

1488
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:30,116
- Look up nice and slow.

1489
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:02,273
- Ruth.

1490
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:06,527
Ruth.

1491
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:09,072
Work.

1492
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:10,990
Work.

1493
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:13,868
Work.

1494
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:16,120
Up.

1495
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:27,024
- Words

1496
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:31,404
and

1497
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:35,616
pictures.

1498
01:47:41,289 --> 01:47:42,790
Words and pictures.

1499
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,127
Skeletons and skulls

1500
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:51,007
of different creatures.

1501
01:47:51,299 --> 01:47:53,843
We borrowed them from the museum.

1502
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:59,432
Did you recognize what some
of those skeletons were?

1503
01:48:00,433 --> 01:48:02,435
There was the skeleton of

1504
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:05,438
a cat.

1505
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:09,567
A cat's skeleton.

1506
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:13,237
The skeleton of

1507
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:15,948
a chicken.

1508
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,827
A chicken's skeleton.

1509
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:25,666
The skeleton of a bird.

1510
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:30,296
A bird's skeleton.

1511
01:50:13,816 --> 01:50:14,567
- Oi!

1512
01:50:16,694 --> 01:50:17,612
What that be?

1513
01:50:17,903 --> 01:50:19,030
- Seed and coney.

1514
01:50:19,322 --> 01:50:19,864
- Give us 'em.

1515
01:50:20,156 --> 01:50:21,157
Give us 'em.

1516
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:22,491
- Better, else us'll pry 'em.

1517
01:50:22,783 --> 01:50:25,786
- Best stand off, else that'll get it.

1518
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:30,291
- Give us 'em.

1519
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:35,129
- Where you stopped at?

1520
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,131
Come with us?

1521
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:39,967
- Where?
- Come on.

1522
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:41,510
- Us place.

1523
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:42,762
Gaz and Spike.

1524
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:45,640
- Share the coney, then.

1525
01:50:45,931 --> 01:50:46,807
Come on.

1526
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:47,933
Come and share the coney.

1527
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:49,268
Give us them, come on.

1528
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,855
Give us them, come on.
- Us place, come on.

1529
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:04,075
- Come back here with that!

1530
01:51:04,367 --> 01:51:04,992
Hey, you!

1531
01:51:06,035 --> 01:51:06,786
Come back!

1532
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,460
Come back!

1533
01:51:28,724 --> 01:51:29,850
Come on, then.

1534
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:32,353
Give us it, come on.

1535
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:35,773
Give us it, come on.

1536
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:39,151
Give us it.

1537
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,525
♪ Deep down in Louisiana
close to New Orleans ♪

1538
01:53:01,817 --> 01:53:05,738
♪ Way back up in the woods
among the evergreens ♪

1539
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,875
- Halt.

1540
01:53:18,167 --> 01:53:18,751
Halt!

1541
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:39,939
- What's wrong,
have you been hurt?

1542
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:41,065
- Baby.

1543
01:53:41,357 --> 01:53:41,941
Coming.

1544
01:53:42,233 --> 01:53:44,193
- No time for babies here.

1545
01:53:44,485 --> 01:53:45,027
- Coming.

1546
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:45,861
Baby.

1547
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:47,112
Coming.
- No time for babies here.

1548
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:47,947
You have to go home.

1549
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:49,990
Use your common sense.

1550
01:53:50,282 --> 01:53:50,908
Coming!

1551
01:53:52,284 --> 01:53:53,911
They're coming!

1552
01:54:28,487 --> 01:54:30,197
- There you are.
