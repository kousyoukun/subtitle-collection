SIX MORAL TALES

2
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,313
THE BAKERY GIRL OF MONCEAU

3
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,503
<i>Paris,</i>
<i>the Villiers intersection.</i>

4
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,071
<i>To the east,</i>
<i>Boulevard des Batignolles.</i>

5
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,135
<i>To the north,</i>
<i>Rue de Lévis and its market.</i>

6
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,842
<i>The Dôme de Villiers café.</i>

7
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,517
<i>To the left,</i>
<i>Avenue de Villiers.</i>

8
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,889
<i>The Villiers metro station.</i>

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,695
<i>To the west,</i>
<i>Boulevard de Courcelles,</i>

10
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,094
<i>which leads</i>
<i>to the Park Monceau</i>

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,497
<i>and a demolition zone on the site</i>
<i>of the former City Club,</i>

12
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,136
<i>a student residence.</i>

13
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>I ate there every night</i>
<i>while in law school.</i>

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,970
<i>Sylvie, who worked in a gallery</i>
<i>on the Rue de Monceau,</i>

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,671
<i>walked home across the park</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

16
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,618
<i>I knew her only by sight.</i>
<i>We passed each other often</i>

17
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,256
<i>between the intersection</i>
<i>and the club.</i>

18
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,858
<i>We'd exchanged furtive looks</i>

19
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,550
<i>but nothing more.</i>

20
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,595
- Don't look back.
- She's a bit tall for me.

21
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,460
<i>Schmidt, my friend,</i>
<i>urged me to act.</i>

22
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,568
<i>But I was scared.</i>

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,295
- Take a chance.
- What, pick her up?

24
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,475
- Why not? One never knows.
- Well, one should.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,104
<i>No, it wasn't her style</i>
<i>to get picked up on the street,</i>

26
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,750
<i>and it was even less</i>
<i>my style to try.</i>

27
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,055
<i>Yet I felt she was ready</i>

28
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,055
<i>to make an exception</i>
<i>to her rule, as I was to mine.</i>

29
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,921
<i>But it was risky,</i>

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,360
<i>and I didn't want to botch it</i>
<i>by not being myself.</i>

31
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,564
Really?

32
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,235
Very long?
- Longer than usual.

33
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,701
Listen,
I feel like following her.

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,141
No, don't.
Go right up to her.

35
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,071
Go right up to her?

36
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,470
<i>I could see</i>
<i>how strongly I felt about her.</i>

37
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,480
<i>It was May,</i>
<i>near the end of the school year.</i>

38
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,657
<i>She had to live nearby.</i>

39
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,688
<i>We'd seen her a few times</i>

40
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,830
<i>carrying a basket,</i>
<i>doing her shopping.</i>

41
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,759
- See?
- Not so loud.

42
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:48,831
What'd I say?

43
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,526
She may live around here.

44
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,428
- Wait.
- Be careful.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,198
Relax.

46
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,979
She went into a shop.

47
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,755
She's ignoring us too intently
to not be aware of us.

48
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,993
Hell, I'm following her.

49
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,381
<i>Even if I'd managed to trail her unseen,</i>
<i>what good would that have done?</i>

50
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,418
I'll catch up.

51
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:50,922
<i>I'd decided to take matters in hand</i>
<i>when fortune at last smiled on me.</i>

52
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,471
Over there!

53
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,442
- What?
- There!

54
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,914
What?

55
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,114
- No harm done.
- Really?

56
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,790
- We didn't really bump.
- Thank goodness.

57
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,118
What a day. I almost broke
my neck on those things earlier.

58
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,163
- I wish I'd seen that.
- I said almost.

59
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,995
I wasn't hurt.
These cars are so loud!

60
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,296
- I go this way.
- I go that way.

61
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,804
Let me make amends.
Meet me for coffee in an hour?

62
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,069
I'm busy tonight. Another time.
We cross paths often.

63
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,015
<i>Throughout our short talk,</i>
<i>I'd had but one thought:</i>

64
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,782
<i>Keep her there.</i>
<i>Say anything.</i>

65
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,950
<i>Forget the assuredly</i>
<i>poor impression I was making.</i>

66
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,130
<i>But my victory was clear.</i>

67
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,664
<i>I must admit, bumping into her</i>
<i>wasn't entirely accidental.</i>

68
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,596
<i>She didn't seem offended.</i>

69
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,704
<i>On the contrary,</i>
<i>she seemed to respond.</i>

70
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,897
<i>Her refusal to meet</i>
<i>meant nothing,</i>

71
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:14,341
<i>since now I could speak to her when</i>
<i>we met again, which would be soon.</i>

72
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,717
<i>Then, what I least expected</i>
<i>happened.</i>

73
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,180
<i>My good luck</i>
<i>was followed by equally bad luck.</i>

74
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,824
<i>Three days passed,</i>
<i>then a week.</i>

75
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,823
<i>No sign of her.</i>

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,522
<i>With exams coming up,</i>
<i>Schmidt went back to his family.</i>

77
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,465
<i>In love though I was,</i>

78
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,729
<i>the idea of giving up study time</i>
<i>to look for Sylvie</i>

79
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,100
<i>never even occurred to me.</i>

80
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,170
<i>My only free time was meal time,</i>

81
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,107
<i>so I did without dinner.</i>

82
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,315
<i>Dinner took 30 minutes,</i>
<i>and my walk three,</i>

83
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,957
<i>so my chances of seeing her</i>
<i>were multiplied by 10.</i>

84
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,493
<i>But the boulevard seemed</i>
<i>a poor vantage point.</i>

85
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:10,034
<i>She might easily</i>
<i>take another route.</i>

86
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>She might even take</i>
<i>the subway or bus.</i>

87
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,840
<i>However, she still had</i>
<i>to go shopping,</i>

88
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,879
<i>so I decided to extend the area</i>
<i>of my search to the Rue de Lévis.</i>

89
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,110
<i>Besides, I must say,</i>

90
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,587
<i>these late-afternoon patrols</i>
<i>were hot, dull and tiring.</i>

91
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,423
<i>The market offered</i>
<i>variety, coolness,</i>

92
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,097
<i>and the compelling</i>
<i>argument of food.</i>

93
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,697
<i>My stomach tempted me.</i>

94
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,769
<i>Weary of cafeterias,</i>
<i>and anticipating vacation,</i>

95
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,703
<i>it craved the gastronomic interlude</i>
<i>that cherry season offered.</i>

96
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,403
<i>The smells and sounds</i>
<i>of the market,</i>

97
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,878
<i>after so many hours</i>
<i>of books and lecture notes,</i>

98
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,247
<i>were more relaxing than the club</i>
<i>and its mess-hall odors.</i>

99
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,327
<i>But my search was still in vain.</i>
<i>Thousands lived in that neighborhood...</i>

100
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,139
<i>possibly one of</i>
<i>the most crowded in Paris.</i>

101
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,874
<i>Should I stay put?</i>

102
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,841
<i>Or walk around?</i>

103
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,313
<i>I was young</i>
<i>and perhaps foolishly hoping</i>

104
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,580
<i>to see her suddenly</i>
<i>appear in a window</i>

105
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,948
<i>or emerge from a shop</i>

106
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,819
<i>and once again find herself</i>
<i>face-to-face with me.</i>

107
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,455
<i>So I decided to stroll around.</i>

108
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,366
<i>That's how I found,</i>
<i>on the Rue Lebouteux,</i>

109
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,640
<i>a little bakery</i>

110
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,782
<i>where I got in the habit</i>
<i>of buying the cookies and pastries</i>

111
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,180
<i>that became</i>
<i>the mainstay of my meals.</i>

112
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,880
<i>Go on, Jackie.</i>
<i>Get going, understand?</i>

113
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,619
<i>Let me work.</i>

114
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,729
<i>Oh, that guy!</i>

115
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,557
<i>Girls are useless.</i>

116
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,430
You should talk.
Go back where you came from.

117
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,296
I'll be back.

118
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,138
What an idiot!

119
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,144
A cookie.

120
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,077
He gets on my nerves.

121
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,780
Which one?
- That one.

122
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,579
To go?

123
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,585
That's right.

124
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,188
Forty centimes.

125
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,284
<i>The cookies were the same</i>
<i>as at any bakery.</i>

126
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,481
<i>They're factory-made.</i>
<i>You find them everywhere.</i>

127
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,681
<i>But here I could eat</i>
<i>without being seen by Sylvie,</i>

128
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,022
<i>who, in the crowded market,</i>
<i>might appear unexpectedly.</i>

129
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:30,263
<i>Besides, buying my pastry</i>
<i>had become a ritual</i>

130
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,165
<i>between me</i>
<i>and the girl at the bakery.</i>

131
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,507
<i>At my age, you hate nothing</i>
<i>more than shopping.</i>

132
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,476
<i>I like to enter a shop</i>

133
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,053
<i>with the air of someone</i>
<i>going in for the first time.</i>

134
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:54,823
<i>Yet I'm pleased when the salesgirl</i>
<i>guesses my game and plays along.</i>

135
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,725
Hello, miss.
A cookie.

136
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,503
Forty centimes?

137
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,958
<i>And still no sign of Sylvie.</i>

138
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,656
<i>Was she avoiding me?</i>
<i>Why, for God's sake?</i>

139
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,629
<i>Was she in the country?</i>

140
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,169
<i>Sick? Dead? Married?</i>

141
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,598
<i>Anything was possible.</i>

142
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,641
<i>By the end of the week,</i>
<i>my vigil was a mere formality.</i>

143
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,671
<i>I would hurry to my bakery,</i>

144
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,443
<i>taking more care each day</i>
<i>with my entrances,</i>

145
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,347
<i>my lingering,</i>
<i>my bizarre conduct.</i>

146
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,896
Two cookies?

147
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,004
Darn!

148
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,975
Don't worry.
Oh, and wrap them separately.

149
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,043
There.

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,760
Wait. I think
I've got the change.

151
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,663
<i>It didn't take long to see</i>
<i>the pretty bakery girl liked me.</i>

152
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,132
<i>Call it vanity if you will,</i>

153
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,170
<i>but the fact that a girl liked me</i>
<i>seemed natural.</i>

154
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,170
<i>And since she wasn't</i>
<i>really my type,</i>

155
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,344
<i>and Sylvie alone,</i>

156
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,376
<i>so superior,</i>
<i>held my thoughts --</i>

157
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,106
<i>Yes, it was because</i>
<i>I was thinking of Sylvie</i>

158
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,013
<i>that I accepted the advances,</i>
<i>which is what they were,</i>

159
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,585
<i>of the bakery girl.</i>

160
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,724
<i>in a much better spirit</i>
<i>than if I had not loved another.</i>

161
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,798
Yes, a cookie.

162
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,472
And a roll.

163
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,939
And, let's see,
give me that one.

164
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,213
Wait.

165
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,078
What's that called?

166
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,913
A <i>gâteau lorrain.</i>

167
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,117
Anything else?

168
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,485
That's all.

169
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,634
Separately?

170
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,339
Yes. But not the cookie.

171
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,443
Wait.

172
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,809
Give me an apricot tart.

173
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,997
<i>I got more involved</i>
<i>in this by the day,</i>

174
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,759
<i>sure that it couldn't go very far.</i>

175
00:13:55,968 --> 00:14:00,166
<i>And it was as good a way as any</i>
<i>both to pass the time</i>

176
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,863
<i>and to get even with Sylvie</i>
<i>for her absence.</i>

177
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,678
<i>And yet this revenge</i>
<i>seemed unworthy of me,</i>

178
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,755
<i>and I ended up taking out</i>
<i>my irritation on the bakery girl.</i>

179
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,291
<i>What upset me</i>
<i>was not that she liked me,</i>

180
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,724
<i>but that she'd think</i>
<i>there was any way</i>

181
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,830
<i>I would like her.</i>

182
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,193
<i>As if to justify myself</i>
<i>in my own eyes,</i>

183
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,801
<i>I told myself it was her fault,</i>

184
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,132
<i>that she must be punished</i>
<i>for playing with fire.</i>

185
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:42,937
<i>My courtship became a daily routine</i>
<i>carried out with such a relaxed air</i>

186
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:47,417
<i>that her initial coyness</i>
<i>didn't put me off at all.</i>

187
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,885
Delicious.
I could eat nothing but pastries.

188
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,615
Me too.

189
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,457
I'll buy you one.

190
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,828
No, thank you.

191
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,401
Come on.

192
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,631
Isn't the boss here?

193
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,172
She's making dinner.

194
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,241
So what are you afraid of?

195
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,823
I'd think you'd hate pastries
after staring at them all day.

196
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,630
I've only been here a month.

197
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,368
I won't be here long,
you know.

198
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,298
In September I start
at one of the big department stores.

199
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,272
You're here all day long?

200
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,576
Until 8:00.

201
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,847
What do you do evenings?

202
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,415
Would you like
to go out some evening?

203
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,559
I'm only 18.

204
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,675
So? Don't your parents
let you go out?

205
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,216
It was an apricot tart
and a baba,

206
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,219
and add an apple tart.

207
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,793
<i>My exams were almost over.</i>
<i>I'd be going on vacation.</i>

208
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,097
- Want any help?
- Heavens, no.

209
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,460
Am I bothering you?
Afraid we'll be seen?

210
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,432
No. Anyway,
I'm leaving in a month.

211
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,366
- Mind if I walk with you a bit?
- I guess not.

212
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,271
Come in here.
I want to tell you something.

213
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,073
Have I done something wrong?

214
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,582
No. I told you,
it's not that.

215
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,783
Let's go out.

216
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,855
Tomorrow.

217
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,492
Leave me alone.

218
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,683
Why?

219
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,487
I don't know you.

220
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,726
We'll get acquainted.

221
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,695
Do I seem so bad?

222
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,068
No strings attached.

223
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,567
We'll go to a movie
on the Champs-Elysées.

224
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,709
You must go to the movies.
- Yes, on Saturday.

225
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,676
Let's go this Saturday.

226
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,312
I'm going with friends.

227
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,503
Boys?

228
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,445
Boys... girls.
They're all silly.

229
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,513
All the more reason.
Saturday then?

230
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,121
No, not Saturday.

231
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,416
Another day.
Do your parents keep you in?

232
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,093
I should hope not!

233
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,556
So tomorrow?

234
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,925
We'll have a nice dinner,
then go to the Champs-Elysées.

235
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,100
I'll meet you at 8:00 at the café.

236
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,235
The Dôme, all right?

237
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,201
Should I dress?

238
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,069
No, you're fine as you are.
All right?

239
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,609
Mother may not like it.

240
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,245
But you said --

241
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,178
Yes, in principle.

242
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,045
Say it's a girlfriend.

243
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,982
I don't know.
Maybe.

244
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,123
Do you like a little intrigue?

245
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,817
Intrigue.

246
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,961
I'll come by tomorrow at 7:30.

247
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,825
In case we can't talk in the bakery,
here's what we'll do.

248
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,092
I'll ask for a pastry.

249
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,203
If you give me two,
it's a go.

250
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,132
In that case we'll meet
at the café at 8:00. Got it?

251
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,712
Repeat it back
so there's no mistake.

252
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,506
If I give you two pastries,
it means yes.

253
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,115
Good. I'll leave now.

254
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,810
I'll go first.

255
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,586
What's your name?

256
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,348
Good-bye, Jacqueline.

257
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,085
<i>There.</i>

258
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,885
<i>I had what I wanted.</i>

259
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,496
<i>But things took a serious turn</i>
<i>I hadn't counted on.</i>

260
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,691
<i>This girl lacked</i>
<i>the easygoing quality</i>

261
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,166
<i>that would have eased</i>
<i>my conscience.</i>

262
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,066
<i>What had I gotten myself into?</i>

263
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,334
<i>Besides, I was leaving Paris.</i>
<i>Not much could happen before then.</i>

264
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,071
<i>I had other worries.</i>

265
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,274
<i>The next day, a Friday,</i>
<i>I took my oral exam and passed.</i>

266
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,854
<i>I almost didn't go to my date.</i>

267
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,181
<i>But none of my friends</i>
<i>were around,</i>

268
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,848
<i>and the thought of an evening</i>
<i>alone was unbearable.</i>

269
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,730
<i>A cookie.</i>

270
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,654
How are you?

271
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,455
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

272
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,289
A bad sprain
that's dragged on three weeks.

273
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,987
How annoying.

274
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,160
I wondered
why I hadn't seen you.

275
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,495
I saw you yesterday,
but you were lost in thought.

276
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,003
Really.

277
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,731
Let's move.

278
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,807
<i>In an instant</i>
<i>I'd made my decision.</i>

279
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,672
- Have you eaten?
- Not a bite.

280
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,381
- This heat makes me hungry.
- No need to explain.

281
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,107
Want to eat together?

282
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,481
Why not? I'll just be a minute.
I'm on the second floor.

283
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,619
I'll wait.

284
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,427
<i>That minute turned into 15,</i>

285
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,602
<i>giving me ample opportunity</i>
<i>to reflect on my rashness.</i>

286
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,566
<i>I could have put Sylvie off a day</i>
<i>and kept my date with my bakery girl.</i>

287
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,743
<i>But my choice had been,</i>
<i>above all, a moral one.</i>

288
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,844
<i>Having found Sylvie again,</i>

289
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,072
<i>seeing the bakery girl would be</i>
<i>a vice, an aberration.</i>

290
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,978
<i>One represented truth</i>
<i>and the other a mistake,</i>

291
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,952
<i>or so I told myself at the time.</i>

292
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,022
<i>To complicate things,</i>

293
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,718
<i>it began to rain,</i>

294
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,262
<i>but that's what</i>
<i>in fact saved me.</i>

295
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:20,908
<i>...it will be exactly 8:00...</i>

296
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,248
You can't walk.
I'll get a cab.

297
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,853
You won't find one in this rain.
I can walk.

298
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,216
Really?

299
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,121
<i>The street was deserted.</i>

300
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,821
<i>The bakery girl could see us</i>
<i>if she came outside.</i>

301
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,830
<i>Like a coward, I thought</i>

302
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,435
<i>she'd be too far away</i>
<i>to make a scene.</i>

303
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,470
<i>I didn't dare turn around,</i>
<i>and the walk seemed endless.</i>

304
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,735
<i>Did she see us, or was she</i>
<i>pining away for me at the café?</i>

305
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,844
<i>I'll never know.</i>

306
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,287
<i>As for winning Sylvie,</i>
<i>I already had.</i>

307
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,949
<i>I learned how that very evening.</i>

308
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,456
I managed
to keep myself entertained.

309
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,629
I can't stand people
who pace in front of my door.

310
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,990
Yes, you may not know it,

311
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,599
but my windows
open onto the street.

312
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,167
I saw everything.

313
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,298
<i>I trembled a moment,</i>
<i>but she went on.</i>

314
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,235
You're terrible.

315
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,669
You almost made me feel guilty.

316
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,811
But then, I couldn't exactly
call out to you.

317
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,506
After all, it's your right to destroy
your stomach with those awful cookies.

318
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,812
- They're good.
- I know. I've tried them.

319
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,956
In short,
I know all your vices.

320
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,650
What'll you have?

321
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,920
The chef's special pastry.

322
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,861
<i>We were married</i>
<i>six months later,</i>

323
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,265
<i>and lived for a while</i>
<i>on the Rue Lebouteux.</i>
