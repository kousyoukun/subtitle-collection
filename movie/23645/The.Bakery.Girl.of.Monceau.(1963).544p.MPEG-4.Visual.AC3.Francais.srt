00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:21,782
SIX MORAL TALES

2
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:25,953
THE BAKERY GIRL OF MONCEAU

3
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,142
<i>Paris,</i>
<i>the Villiers intersection.</i>

4
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:42,710
<i>To the east,</i>
<i>Boulevard des Batignolles.</i>

5
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:47,775
<i>To the north,</i>
<i>Rue de Lévis and its market.</i>

6
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:53,482
<i>The Dôme de Villiers café.</i>

7
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:57,157
<i>To the left,</i>
<i>Avenue de Villiers.</i>

8
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,528
<i>The Villiers metro station.</i>

9
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,335
<i>To the west,</i>
<i>Boulevard de Courcelles,</i>

10
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>which leads</i>
<i>to the Park Monceau</i>

11
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,137
<i>and a demolition zone on the site</i>
<i>of the former City Club,</i>

12
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:12,776
<i>a student residence.</i>

13
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:16,839
<i>l ate there every night</i>
<i>while in law school.</i>

14
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,610
<i>Sylvie, who worked in a gallery</i>
<i>on the Rue de Monceau,</i>

15
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,310
<i>walked home across the park</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

16
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,258
<i>l knew her only by sight.</i>
<i>We passed each other often</i>

17
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,895
<i>between the intersection</i>
<i>and the club.</i>

18
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:34,497
<i>We'd exchanged furtive looks</i>

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,190
<i>but nothing more.</i>

20
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:39,234
- Don't Iook back.
- She's a bit taII for me.

21
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,100
<i>Schmidt, my friend,</i>
<i>urged me to act.</i>

22
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:44,207
<i>But l was scared.</i>

23
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,934
- Take a chance.
- What, pick her up?

24
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,114
- Why not? One never knows.
- WeII, one shouId.

25
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:56,744
<i>No, it wasn't her style</i>
<i>to get picked up on the street,</i>

26
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,389
<i>and it was even less</i>
<i>my style to try.</i>

27
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:04,694
<i>Yet l felt she was ready</i>

28
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:07,695
<i>to make an exception</i>
<i>to her rule, as l was to mine.</i>

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,561
<i>But it was risky,</i>

30
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,999
<i>and l didn't want to botch it</i>
<i>by not being myself.</i>

31
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,204
ReaIIy?

32
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,875
Very Iong?
- Longer than usuaI.

33
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:20,340
Listen,
I feeI Iike foIIowing her.

34
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,780
No, don't.
Go right up to her.

35
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,710
Go right up to her?

36
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:29,110
<i>l could see</i>
<i>how strongly l felt about her.</i>

37
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:33,120
<i>lt was May,</i>
<i>near the end of the school year.</i>

38
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:40,297
<i>She had to live nearby.</i>

39
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,328
<i>We'd seen her a few times</i>

40
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:45,469
<i>carrying a basket,</i>
<i>doing her shopping.</i>

41
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,399
- See?
- Not so Ioud.

42
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:49,471
What'd I say?

43
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:52,166
She may Iive around here.

44
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,068
- Wait.
- Be carefuI.

45
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,837
ReIax.

46
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,618
She went into a shop.

47
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:19,395
She's ignoring us too intentIy
to not be aware of us.

48
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:25,633
HeII, I'm foIIowing her.

49
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,020
<i>Even if l'd managed to trail her unseen,</i>
<i>what good would that have done?</i>

50
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:45,058
I'II catch up.

51
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:51,562
<i>l'd decided to take matters in hand</i>
<i>when fortune at last smiled on me.</i>

52
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,110
Over there!

53
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,082
- What?
- There!

54
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:12,553
What?

55
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,754
- No harm done.
- ReaIIy?

56
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,430
- We didn't reaIIy bump.
- Thank goodness.

57
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,757
What a day. I aImost broke
my neck on those things earIier.

58
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,803
- I wish I'd seen that.
- I said aImost.

59
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,634
I wasn't hurt.
These cars are so Ioud!

60
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:32,935
- I go this way.
- I go that way.

61
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:36,444
Let me make amends.
Meet me for coffee in an hour?

62
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:39,708
I'm busy tonight. Another time.
We cross paths often.

63
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,654
<i>Throughout our short talk,</i>
<i>l'd had but one thought.</i>

64
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,421
<i>Keep her there.</i>
<i>Say anything.</i>

65
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:56,590
<i>Forget the assuredly</i>
<i>poor impression l was making.</i>

66
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,770
<i>But my victory was clear.</i>

67
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,303
<i>l must admit, bumping into her</i>
<i>wasn't entirely accidental.</i>

68
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,236
<i>She didn't seem offended.</i>

69
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,344
<i>On the contrary,</i>
<i>she seemed to respond.</i>

70
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,537
<i>Her refusal to meet</i>
<i>meant nothing,</i>

71
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:14,981
<i>since now l could speak to her when</i>
<i>we met again, which would be soon.</i>

72
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:20,357
<i>Then, what l least expected</i>
<i>happened.</i>

73
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:24,819
<i>My good luck</i>
<i>was followed by equally bad luck.</i>

74
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,464
<i>Three days passed,</i>
<i>then a week.</i>

75
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,463
<i>No sign of her.</i>

76
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:34,162
<i>With exams coming up,</i>
<i>Schmidt went back to his family.</i>

77
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:37,104
<i>ln love though l was,</i>

78
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:40,369
<i>the idea of giving up study time</i>
<i>to look for Sylvie</i>

79
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,740
<i>never even occurred to me.</i>

80
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:45,810
<i>My only free time was meal time,</i>

81
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,746
<i>so l did without dinner.</i>

82
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:55,955
<i>Dinner took 30 minutes,</i>
<i>and my walk three,</i>

83
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,597
<i>so my chances of seeing her</i>
<i>were multiplied by 10.</i>

84
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,132
<i>But the boulevard seemed</i>
<i>a poor vantage point.</i>

85
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:10,674
<i>She might easily</i>
<i>take another route.</i>

86
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,640
<i>She might even take</i>
<i>the subway or bus.</i>

87
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:19,479
<i>However, she still had</i>
<i>to go shopping,</i>

88
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:23,518
<i>so l decided to extend the area</i>
<i>of my search to the Rue de Lévis.</i>

89
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,749
<i>Besides, l must say,</i>

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>these late-afternoon patrols</i>
<i>were hot, dull and tiring.</i>

91
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:37,062
<i>The market offered</i>
<i>variety, coolness,</i>

92
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,737
<i>and the compelling</i>
<i>argument of food.</i>

93
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:42,337
<i>My stomach tempted me.</i>

94
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,409
<i>Weary of cafeterias,</i>
<i>and anticipating vacation,</i>

95
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:50,342
<i>it craved the gastronomic interlude</i>
<i>that cherry season offered.</i>

96
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:55,043
<i>The smells and sounds</i>
<i>of the market,</i>

97
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,517
<i>after so many hours</i>
<i>of books and lecture notes,</i>

98
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:01,886
<i>were more relaxing than the club</i>
<i>and its mess-hall odors.</i>

99
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:16,967
<i>But my search was still in vain.</i>
<i>Thousands lived in that neighborhood...</i>

100
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,779
<i>possibly one of</i>
<i>the most crowded in Paris.</i>

101
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:26,514
<i>Should l stay put?</i>

102
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,481
<i>Or walk around?</i>

103
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,953
<i>l was young</i>
<i>and perhaps foolishly hoping</i>

104
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,220
<i>to see her suddenly</i>
<i>appear in a window</i>

105
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:37,588
<i>or emerge from a shop</i>

106
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:41,459
<i>and once again find herself</i>
<i>face-to-face with me.</i>

107
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,094
<i>So l decided to stroll around.</i>

108
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:58,005
<i>That's how l found,</i>
<i>on the Rue Lebouteux,</i>

109
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:01,280
<i>a little bakery</i>

110
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:04,421
<i>where l got in the habit</i>
<i>of buying the cookies and pastries</i>

111
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:07,820
<i>that became</i>
<i>the mainstay of my meals.</i>

112
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,519
<i>Go on, Jackie.</i>
<i>Get going, understand?</i>

113
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,259
<i>Let me work.</i>

114
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,369
<i>Oh, that guy!</i>

115
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,197
<i>Girls are useless.</i>

116
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:23,069
You shouId taIk.
Go back where you came from.

117
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,936
I'II be back.

118
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:29,778
What an idiot!

119
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:32,783
A cookie.

120
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,716
He gets on my ne<i>rv</i>es.

121
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:39,419
Which one?
- That one.

122
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:43,219
To go?

123
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,225
That's right.

124
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,827
Forty centimes.

125
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,924
<i>The cookies were the same</i>
<i>as at any bakery.</i>

126
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:16,121
<i>They're factory-made.</i>
<i>You find them everywhere.</i>

127
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:20,321
<i>But here l could eat</i>
<i>without being seen by Sylvie,</i>

128
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:24,662
<i>who, in the crowded market,</i>
<i>might appear unexpectedly.</i>

129
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:30,903
<i>Besides, buying my pastry</i>
<i>had become a ritual</i>

130
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:33,805
<i>between me</i>
<i>and the girl at the bakery.</i>

131
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,147
<i>At my age, you hate nothing</i>
<i>more than shopping.</i>

132
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,115
<i>l like to enter a shop</i>

133
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:50,692
<i>with the air of someone</i>
<i>going in for the first time.</i>

134
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:55,463
<i>Yet l'm pleased when the salesgirl</i>
<i>guesses my game and plays along.</i>

135
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,365
HeIIo, miss.
A cookie.

136
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,142
Forty centimes?

137
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:33,598
<i>And still no sign of Sylvie.</i>

138
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:36,296
<i>Was she avoiding me?</i>
<i>Why, for God's sake?</i>

139
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:38,269
<i>Was she in the country?</i>

140
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:40,808
<i>Sick? Dead? Married?</i>

141
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,238
<i>Anything was possible.</i>

142
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:47,281
<i>By the end of the week,</i>
<i>my vigil was a mere formality.</i>

143
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,311
<i>l would hurry to my bakery,</i>

144
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:52,083
<i>taking more care each day</i>
<i>with my entrances,</i>

145
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,986
<i>my lingering,</i>
<i>my bizarre conduct.</i>

146
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:08,536
Two cookies?

147
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,644
Darn!

148
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:22,615
Don't worry.
Oh, and wrap them separateIy.

149
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:25,682
There.

150
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,399
Wait. I think
I've got the change.

151
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:16,302
<i>lt didn't take long to see</i>
<i>the pretty bakery girl liked me.</i>

152
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,772
<i>Call it vanity if you will,</i>

153
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,810
<i>but the fact that a girl liked me</i>
<i>seemed natural.</i>

154
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:24,809
<i>And since she wasn't</i>
<i>really my type,</i>

155
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,984
<i>and Sylvie alone,</i>

156
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:29,016
<i>so superior,</i>
<i>held my thoughts --</i>

157
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,745
<i>Yes, it was because</i>
<i>l was thinking of Sylvie</i>

158
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,652
<i>that l accepted the advances,</i>
<i>which is what they were,</i>

159
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:36,224
<i>of the bakery girl.</i>

160
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:40,363
<i>in a much better spirit</i>
<i>than if l had not loved another.</i>

161
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,438
Yes, a cookie.

162
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,112
And a roII.

163
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,578
And, Iet's see,
give me that one.

164
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:05,853
Wait.

165
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,718
What's that caIIed?

166
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:09,553
A <i>gâteau lorrain.</i>

167
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:13,757
Anything eIse?

168
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,125
That's aII.

169
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,274
SeparateIy?

170
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:31,978
Yes. But not the cookie.

171
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:36,083
Wait.

172
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,448
Give me an apricot tart.

173
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:53,636
<i>l got more involved</i>
<i>in this by the day,</i>

174
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:56,398
<i>sure that it couldn't go very far.</i>

175
00:13:56,608 --> 00:14:00,806
<i>And it was as good a way as any</i>
<i>both to pass the time</i>

176
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,503
<i>and to get even with Sylvie</i>
<i>for her absence.</i>

177
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,317
<i>And yet this revenge</i>
<i>seemed unworthy of me,</i>

178
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:19,394
<i>and l ended up taking out</i>
<i>my irritation on the bakery girl.</i>

179
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,930
<i>What upset me</i>
<i>was not that she liked me,</i>

180
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:25,364
<i>but that she'd think</i>
<i>there was any way</i>

181
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,470
<i>l would like her.</i>

182
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:29,833
<i>As if to justify myself</i>
<i>in my own eyes,</i>

183
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,441
<i>l told myself it was her fault,</i>

184
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:35,772
<i>that she must be punished</i>
<i>for playing with fire.</i>

185
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:43,577
<i>My courtship became a daily routine</i>
<i>carried out with such a relaxed air</i>

186
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:48,057
<i>that her initial coyness</i>
<i>didn't put me off at all.</i>

187
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:51,524
DeIicious.
I couId eat nothing but pastries.

188
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:53,254
Me too.

189
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,096
I'II buy you one.

190
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:04,468
No, thank you.

191
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,041
Come on.

192
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,271
Isn't the boss here?

193
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,811
She's making dinner.

194
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,880
So what are you afraid of?

195
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:32,463
I'd think you'd hate pastries
after staring at them aII day.

196
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:37,270
I've onIy been here a month.

197
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:40,008
I won't be here Iong,
you know.

198
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,938
In September I start
at one of the big department stores.

199
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:45,911
You're here aII day Iong?

200
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,216
UntiI 8:00.

201
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,486
What do you do evenings?

202
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,055
WouId you Iike
to go out some evening?

203
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,198
I'm onIy 18.

204
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:17,314
So? Don't your parents
Iet you go out?

205
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:30,855
It was an apricot tart
and a baba,

206
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:32,859
and add an appIe tart.

207
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:38,432
<i>My exams were almost over.</i>
<i>l'd be going on vacation.</i>

208
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,737
- Want any heIp?
- Heavens, no.

209
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:43,099
Am I bothering you?
Afraid we'II be seen?

210
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:46,071
No. Anyway,
I'm Ieaving in a month.

211
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:50,006
- Mind if I waIk with you a bit?
- I guess not.

212
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:52,910
Come in here.
I want to teII you something.

213
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,713
Have I done something wrong?

214
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,222
No. I toId you,
it's not that.

215
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:06,423
Let's go out.

216
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,495
Tomorrow.

217
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:09,131
Leave me aIone.

218
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,322
Why?

219
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,127
I don't know you.

220
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,365
We'II get acquainted.

221
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,335
Do I seem so bad?

222
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,708
No strings attached.

223
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:22,206
We'II go to a movie
on the Champs-EIysées.

224
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,348
You must go to the movies.
- Yes, on Saturday.

225
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,316
Let's go this Saturday.

226
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,951
I'm going with friends.

227
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:30,142
Boys?

228
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:33,084
Boys... girIs.
They're aII siIIy.

229
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,152
AII the more reason.
Saturday then?

230
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:38,761
No, not Saturday.

231
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,056
Another day.
Do your parents keep you in?

232
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,732
I shouId hope not!

233
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:44,196
So tomorrow?

234
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,565
We'II have a nice dinner,
then go to the Champs-EIysées.

235
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:49,740
I'II meet you at 8:00 at the café.

236
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,875
The Dôme, aII right?

237
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,841
ShouId I dress?

238
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,709
No, you're fine as you are.
AII right?

239
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:02,249
Mother may not Iike it.

240
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,885
But you said --

241
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:05,817
Yes, in principIe.

242
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,684
Say it's a girIfriend.

243
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,621
I don't know.
Maybe.

244
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,762
Do you Iike a IittIe intrigue?

245
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:14,457
Intrigue.

246
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,600
I'II come by tomorrow at 7:30.

247
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:21,465
In case we can't taIk in the bakery,
here's what we'II do.

248
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,731
I'II ask for a pastry.

249
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,842
If you give me two,
it's a go.

250
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:30,771
In that case we'II meet
at the café at 8:00. Got it?

251
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,352
Repeat it back
so there's no mistake.

252
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:39,146
If I give you two pastries,
it means yes.

253
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,754
Good. I'II Ieave now.

254
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,449
I'II go first.

255
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:45,226
What's your name?

256
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:46,987
Good-bye, JacqueIine.

257
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:48,725
<i>There.</i>

258
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,525
<i>l had what l wanted.</i>

259
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:54,136
<i>But things took a serious turn</i>
<i>l hadn't counted on.</i>

260
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,330
<i>This girl lacked</i>
<i>the easygoing quality</i>

261
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,806
<i>that would have eased</i>
<i>my conscience.</i>

262
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:01,706
<i>What had l gotten myself into?</i>

263
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:05,974
<i>Besides, l was leaving Paris.</i>
<i>Not much could happen before then.</i>

264
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:09,710
<i>l had other worries.</i>

265
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:13,914
<i>The next day, a Friday,</i>
<i>l took my oral exam and passed.</i>

266
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:16,493
<i>l almost didn't go to my date.</i>

267
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,821
<i>But none of my friends</i>
<i>were around,</i>

268
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,488
<i>and the thought of an evening</i>
<i>alone was unbearable.</i>

269
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,370
<i>A cookie.</i>

270
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:53,294
How are you?

271
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:56,094
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

272
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,928
A bad sprain
that's dragged on three weeks.

273
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,626
How annoying.

274
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:02,800
I wondered
why I hadn't seen you.

275
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:06,135
I saw you yesterday,
but you were Iost in thought.

276
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:08,642
ReaIIy.

277
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,370
Let's move.

278
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:12,446
<i>ln an instant</i>
<i>l'd made my decision.</i>

279
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,312
- Have you eaten?
- Not a bite.

280
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:18,020
- This heat makes me hungry.
- No need to expIain.

281
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:19,746
Want to eat together?

282
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:23,120
Why not? I'II just be a minute.
I'm on the second fIoor.

283
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,259
I'II wait.

284
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,067
<i>That minute turned into 15,</i>

285
00:20:35,272 --> 00:20:38,241
<i>giving me ample opportunity</i>
<i>to reflect on my rashness.</i>

286
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:43,205
<i>l could have put Sylvie off a day</i>
<i>and kept my date with my bakery girl.</i>

287
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:46,382
<i>But my choice had been,</i>
<i>above all, a moral one.</i>

288
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,484
<i>Having found Sylvie again,</i>

289
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:51,712
<i>seeing the bakery girl would be</i>
<i>a vice, an aberration.</i>

290
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,617
<i>One represented truth</i>
<i>and the other a mistake,</i>

291
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:57,592
<i>or so l told myself at the time.</i>

292
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,662
<i>To complicate things,</i>

293
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:05,358
<i>it began to rain,</i>

294
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:07,901
<i>but that's what</i>
<i>in fact saved me.</i>

295
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:21,548
<i>...it will be exactly 8.00...</i>

296
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,887
You can't waIk.
I'II get a cab.

297
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:31,493
You won't find one in this rain.
I can waIk.

298
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:32,856
ReaIIy?

299
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,760
<i>The street was deserted.</i>

300
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,460
<i>The bakery girl could see us</i>
<i>if she came outside.</i>

301
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:43,469
<i>Like a coward, l thought</i>

302
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:46,074
<i>she'd be too far away</i>
<i>to make a scene.</i>

303
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:50,109
<i>l didn't dare turn around,</i>
<i>and the walk seemed endless.</i>

304
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:53,374
<i>Did she see us, or was she</i>
<i>pining away for me at the café?</i>

305
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,484
<i>l'll never know.</i>

306
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:03,927
<i>As for winning Sylvie,</i>
<i>l already had.</i>

307
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:06,589
<i>l learned how that very evening.</i>

308
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:09,095
I managed
to keep myseIf entertained.

309
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,269
I can't stand peopIe
who pace in front of my door.

310
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,630
Yes, you may not know it,

311
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,239
but my windows
open onto the street.

312
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,806
I saw everything.

313
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:21,937
<i>l trembled a moment,</i>
<i>but she went on.</i>

314
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,875
You're terribIe.

315
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,309
You aImost made me feeI guiIty.

316
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:29,451
But then, I couIdn't exactIy
caII out to you.

317
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:33,145
After aII, it's your right to destroy
your stomach with those awfuI cookies.

318
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:36,451
- They're good.
- I know. I've tried them.

319
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,596
In short,
I know aII your vices.

320
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:42,289
What'II you have?

321
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,560
The chef's speciaI pastry.

322
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:49,501
<i>We were married</i>
<i>six months later,</i>

323
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:53,905
