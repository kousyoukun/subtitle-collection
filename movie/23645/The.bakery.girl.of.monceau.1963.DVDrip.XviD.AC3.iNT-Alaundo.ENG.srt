00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,367
SIX MORAL TALES

2
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,538
THE BAKERY GIRL OF MONCEAU

3
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,728
<i>Paris,</i>
<i>the Villiers intersection.</i>

4
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,296
<i>To the east,</i>
<i>Boulevard des Batignolles.</i>

5
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:47,360
<i>To the north,</i>
<i>Rue de Lévis and its market.</i>

6
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,067
<i>The Dôme de Villiers café.</i>

7
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,742
<i>To the left,</i>
<i>Avenue de Villiers.</i>

8
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:01,114
<i>The Villiers metro station.</i>

9
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,920
<i>To the west,</i>
<i>Boulevard de Courcelles,</i>

10
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,319
<i>which leads</i>
<i>to the Park Monceau</i>

11
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,722
<i>and a demolition zone on the site</i>
<i>of the former City Club,</i>

12
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,361
<i>a student residence.</i>

13
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,425
<i>I ate there every night</i>
<i>while in law school.</i>

14
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:20,195
<i>Sylvie, who worked in a gallery</i>
<i>on the Rue de Monceau,</i>

15
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:22,896
<i>walked home across the park</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

16
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:28,843
<i>I knew her only by sight.</i>
<i>We passed each other often</i>

17
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,481
<i>between the intersection</i>
<i>and the club.</i>

18
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,083
<i>We'd exchanged furtive looks</i>

19
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,775
<i>but nothing more.</i>

20
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:38,820
- Don't look back.
- She's a bit tall for me.

21
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,685
<i>Schmidt, my friend,</i>
<i>urged me to act.</i>

22
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,793
<i>But I was scared.</i>

23
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,520
- Take a chance.
- What, pick her up?

24
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,700
- Why not? One never knows.
- Well, one should.

25
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:56,329
<i>No, it wasn't her style</i>
<i>to get picked up on the street,</i>

26
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,975
<i>and it was even less</i>
<i>my style to try.</i>

27
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,280
<i>Yet I felt she was ready</i>

28
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:07,280
<i>to make an exception</i>
<i>to her rule, as I was to mine.</i>

29
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,146
<i>But it was risky,</i>

30
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:12,585
<i>and I didn't want to botch it</i>
<i>by not being myself.</i>

31
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,789
Really?

32
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:17,460
Very long?
- Longer than usual.

33
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:19,926
Listen,
I feel like following her.

34
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:22,366
No, don't.
Go right up to her.

35
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,296
Go right up to her?

36
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,695
<i>I could see</i>
<i>how strongly I felt about her.</i>

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,705
<i>It was May,</i>
<i>near the end of the school year.</i>

38
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,882
<i>She had to live nearby.</i>

39
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:41,913
<i>We'd seen her a few times</i>

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,055
<i>carrying a basket,</i>
<i>doing her shopping.</i>

41
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,984
- See?
- Not so loud.

42
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,056
What'd I say?

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,751
She may live around here.

44
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,653
- Wait.
- Be careful.

45
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:55,423
Relax.

46
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,204
She went into a shop.

47
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,980
She's ignoring us too intently
to not be aware of us.

48
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:25,218
Hell, I'm following her.

49
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:41,606
<i>Even if I'd managed to trail her unseen,</i>
<i>what good would that have done?</i>

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,643
I'll catch up.

51
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,147
<i>I'd decided to take matters in hand</i>
<i>when fortune at last smiled on me.</i>

52
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,696
Over there!

53
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:05,667
- What?
- There!

54
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:12,139
What?

55
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,339
- No harm done.
- Really?

56
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,015
- We didn't really bump.
- Thank goodness.

57
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,343
What a day. I almost broke
my neck on those things earlier.

58
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,388
- I wish I'd seen that.
- I said almost.

59
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:30,220
I wasn't hurt.
These cars are so loud!

60
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,521
- I go this way.
- I go that way.

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,029
Let me make amends.
Meet me for coffee in an hour?

62
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,294
I'm busy tonight. Another time.
We cross paths often.

63
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,240
<i>Throughout our short talk,</i>
<i>I'd had but one thought:</i>

64
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:52,007
<i>Keep her there.</i>
<i>Say anything.</i>

65
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:56,175
<i>Forget the assuredly</i>
<i>poor impression I was making.</i>

66
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,355
<i>But my victory was clear.</i>

67
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:01,889
<i>I must admit, bumping into her</i>
<i>wasn't entirely accidental.</i>

68
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,821
<i>She didn't seem offended.</i>

69
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,929
<i>On the contrary,</i>
<i>she seemed to respond.</i>

70
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,122
<i>Her refusal to meet</i>
<i>meant nothing,</i>

71
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:14,566
<i>since now I could speak to her when</i>
<i>we met again, which would be soon.</i>

72
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,942
<i>Then, what I least expected</i>
<i>happened.</i>

73
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:24,405
<i>My good luck</i>
<i>was followed by equally bad luck.</i>

74
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,049
<i>Three days passed,</i>
<i>then a week.</i>

75
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,048
<i>No sign of her.</i>

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,747
<i>With exams coming up,</i>
<i>Schmidt went back to his family.</i>

77
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:36,690
<i>In love though I was,</i>

78
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:39,954
<i>the idea of giving up study time</i>
<i>to look for Sylvie</i>

79
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,325
<i>never even occurred to me.</i>

80
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,395
<i>My only free time was meal time,</i>

81
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,332
<i>so I did without dinner.</i>

82
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:55,540
<i>Dinner took 30 minutes,</i>
<i>and my walk three,</i>

83
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:59,182
<i>so my chances of seeing her</i>
<i>were multiplied by 10.</i>

84
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,718
<i>But the boulevard seemed</i>
<i>a poor vantage point.</i>

85
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:10,259
<i>She might easily</i>
<i>take another route.</i>

86
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,225
<i>She might even take</i>
<i>the subway or bus.</i>

87
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:19,065
<i>However, she still had</i>
<i>to go shopping,</i>

88
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,104
<i>so I decided to extend the area</i>
<i>of my search to the Rue de Lévis.</i>

89
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,335
<i>Besides, I must say,</i>

90
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:32,812
<i>these late-afternoon patrols</i>
<i>were hot, dull and tiring.</i>

91
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,648
<i>The market offered</i>
<i>variety, coolness,</i>

92
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,322
<i>and the compelling</i>
<i>argument of food.</i>

93
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,922
<i>My stomach tempted me.</i>

94
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:45,994
<i>Weary of cafeterias,</i>
<i>and anticipating vacation,</i>

95
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,928
<i>it craved the gastronomic interlude</i>
<i>that cherry season offered.</i>

96
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:54,628
<i>The smells and sounds</i>
<i>of the market,</i>

97
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,103
<i>after so many hours</i>
<i>of books and lecture notes,</i>

98
00:06:57,308 --> 00:07:01,472
<i>were more relaxing than the club</i>
<i>and its mess-hall odors.</i>

99
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:16,552
<i>But my search was still in vain.</i>
<i>Thousands lived in that neighborhood...</i>

100
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:22,364
<i>possibly one of</i>
<i>the most crowded in Paris.</i>

101
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:26,099
<i>Should I stay put?</i>

102
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,066
<i>Or walk around?</i>

103
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:31,538
<i>I was young</i>
<i>and perhaps foolishly hoping</i>

104
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,805
<i>to see her suddenly</i>
<i>appear in a window</i>

105
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,173
<i>or emerge from a shop</i>

106
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:41,044
<i>and once again find herself</i>
<i>face-to-face with me.</i>

107
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,680
<i>So I decided to stroll around.</i>

108
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,591
<i>That's how I found,</i>
<i>on the Rue Lebouteux,</i>

109
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:00,865
<i>a little bakery</i>

110
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:04,007
<i>where I got in the habit</i>
<i>of buying the cookies and pastries</i>

111
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,405
<i>that became</i>
<i>the mainstay of my meals.</i>

112
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,105
<i>Go on, Jackie.</i>
<i>Get going, understand?</i>

113
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,844
<i>Let me work.</i>

114
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:17,954
<i>Oh, that guy!</i>

115
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:19,782
<i>Girls are useless.</i>

116
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,655
You should talk.
Go back where you came from.

117
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,521
I'll be back.

118
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:29,363
What an idiot!

119
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:32,369
A cookie.

120
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,302
He gets on my nerves.

121
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,005
Which one?
- That one.

122
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:42,804
To go?

123
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,810
That's right.

124
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:49,413
Forty centimes.

125
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,509
<i>The cookies were the same</i>
<i>as at any bakery.</i>

126
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,706
<i>They're factory-made.</i>
<i>You find them everywhere.</i>

127
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:19,906
<i>But here I could eat</i>
<i>without being seen by Sylvie,</i>

128
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:24,247
<i>who, in the crowded market,</i>
<i>might appear unexpectedly.</i>

129
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:30,488
<i>Besides, buying my pastry</i>
<i>had become a ritual</i>

130
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:33,390
<i>between me</i>
<i>and the girl at the bakery.</i>

131
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:43,732
<i>At my age, you hate nothing</i>
<i>more than shopping.</i>

132
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:46,701
<i>I like to enter a shop</i>

133
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:50,278
<i>with the air of someone</i>
<i>going in for the first time.</i>

134
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:55,048
<i>Yet I'm pleased when the salesgirl</i>
<i>guesses my game and plays along.</i>

135
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,950
Hello, miss.
A cookie.

136
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,728
Forty centimes?

137
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,183
<i>And still no sign of Sylvie.</i>

138
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,881
<i>Was she avoiding me?</i>
<i>Why, for God's sake?</i>

139
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,854
<i>Was she in the country?</i>

140
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:40,394
<i>Sick? Dead? Married?</i>

141
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:42,823
<i>Anything was possible.</i>

142
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,866
<i>By the end of the week,</i>
<i>my vigil was a mere formality.</i>

143
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,896
<i>I would hurry to my bakery,</i>

144
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:51,668
<i>taking more care each day</i>
<i>with my entrances,</i>

145
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,572
<i>my lingering,</i>
<i>my bizarre conduct.</i>

146
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,121
Two cookies?

147
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:19,229
Darn!

148
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:22,200
Don't worry.
Oh, and wrap them separately.

149
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,268
There.

150
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:36,985
Wait. I think
I've got the change.

151
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:15,888
<i>It didn't take long to see</i>
<i>the pretty bakery girl liked me.</i>

152
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:18,357
<i>Call it vanity if you will,</i>

153
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,395
<i>but the fact that a girl liked me</i>
<i>seemed natural.</i>

154
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,395
<i>And since she wasn't</i>
<i>really my type,</i>

155
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,569
<i>and Sylvie alone,</i>

156
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,601
<i>so superior,</i>
<i>held my thoughts —</i>

157
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,331
<i>Yes, it was because</i>
<i>I was thinking of Sylvie</i>

158
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,238
<i>that I accepted the advances,</i>
<i>which is what they were,</i>

159
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,810
<i>of the bakery girl.</i>

160
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:39,949
<i>In a much better spirit</i>
<i>than if I had not loved another.</i>

161
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,023
Yes, a cookie.

162
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,697
And a roll.

163
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,164
And, let's see,
give me that one.

164
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:05,438
Wait.

165
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,303
What's that called?

166
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,138
A <i>gâteau lorrain.</i>

167
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,342
Anything else?

168
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,710
That's all.

169
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,859
Separately?

170
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,564
Yes. But not the cookie.

171
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:35,668
Wait.

172
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,034
Give me an apricot tart.

173
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,222
<i>I got more involved</i>
<i>in this by the day,</i>

174
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,984
<i>sure that it couldn't go very far.</i>

175
00:13:56,193 --> 00:14:00,391
<i>And it was as good a way as any</i>
<i>both to pass the time</i>

176
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:03,088
<i>and to get even with Sylvie</i>
<i>for her absence.</i>

177
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,903
<i>And yet this revenge</i>
<i>seemed unworthy of me,</i>

178
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:18,980
<i>and I ended up taking out</i>
<i>my irritation on the bakery girl.</i>

179
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:22,516
<i>What upset me</i>
<i>was not that she liked me,</i>

180
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,949
<i>but that she'd think</i>
<i>there was any way</i>

181
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,055
<i>I would like her.</i>

182
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,418
<i>As if to justify myself</i>
<i>in my own eyes,</i>

183
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:32,026
<i>I told myself it was her fault,</i>

184
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:35,357
<i>that she must be punished</i>
<i>for playing with fire.</i>

185
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:43,162
<i>My courtship became a daily routine</i>
<i>carried out with such a relaxed air</i>

186
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,642
<i>that her initial coyness</i>
<i>didn't put me off at all.</i>

187
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,110
Delicious.
I could eat nothing but pastries.

188
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:52,840
Me too.

189
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,682
I'll buy you one.

190
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,053
No, thank you.

191
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:05,626
Come on.

192
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,856
Isn't the boss here?

193
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,397
She's making dinner.

194
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,466
So what are you afraid of?

195
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:32,048
I'd think you'd hate pastries
after staring at them all day.

196
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,855
I've only been here a month.

197
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,593
I won't be here long,
you know.

198
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:43,523
In September I start
at one of the big department stores.

199
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,497
You're here all day long?

200
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:47,801
Until 8:00.

201
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,072
What do you do evenings?

202
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:57,640
Would you like
to go out some evening?

203
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,784
I'm only 18.

204
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,900
So? Don't your parents
let you go out?

205
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:30,441
It was an apricot tart
and a baba,

206
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,444
and add an apple tart.

207
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:38,018
<i>My exams were almost over.</i>
<i>I'd be going on vacation.</i>

208
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,322
- Want any help?
- Heavens, no.

209
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,685
Am I bothering you?
Afraid we'll be seen?

210
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:45,657
No. Anyway,
I'm leaving in a month.

211
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,591
- Mind if I walk with you a bit?
- I guess not.

212
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,496
Come in here.
I want to tell you something.

213
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,298
Have I done something wrong?

214
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,807
No. I told you,
it's not that.

215
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:06,008
Let's go out.

216
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,080
Tomorrow.

217
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:08,717
Leave me alone.

218
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:09,908
Why?

219
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,712
I don't know you.

220
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,951
We'll get acquainted.

221
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,920
Do I seem so bad?

222
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:18,293
No strings attached.

223
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:21,792
We'll go to a movie
on the Champs-Elysées.

224
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,934
You must go to the movies.
- Yes, on Saturday.

225
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,901
Let's go this Saturday.

226
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,537
I'm going with friends.

227
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:29,728
Boys?

228
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,670
Boys... girls.
They're all silly.

229
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,738
All the more reason.
Saturday then?

230
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,346
No, not Saturday.

231
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:40,641
Another day.
Do your parents keep you in?

232
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,318
I should hope not!

233
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,781
So tomorrow?

234
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:47,150
We'll have a nice dinner,
then go to the Champs-Elysées.

235
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,325
I'll meet you at 8:00 at the café.

236
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,460
The Dôme, all right?

237
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,426
Should I dress?

238
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:58,294
No, you're fine as you are.
All right?

239
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,834
Mother may not like it.

240
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:03,470
But you said —

241
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,403
Yes, in principle.

242
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:07,270
Say it's a girlfriend.

243
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:10,207
I don't know.
Maybe.

244
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,348
Do you like a little intrigue?

245
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,042
Intrigue.

246
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:17,186
I'll come by tomorrow at 7:30.

247
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,050
In case we can't talk in the bakery,
here's what we'll do.

248
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:23,317
I'll ask for a pastry.

249
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:26,428
If you give me two,
it's a go.

250
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,357
In that case we'll meet
at the café at 8:00. Got it?

251
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,937
Repeat it back
so there's no mistake.

252
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:38,731
If I give you two pastries,
it means yes.

253
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,340
Good. I'll leave now.

254
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,035
I'll go first.

255
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,811
What's your name?

256
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,573
Good-bye, Jacqueline.

257
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,310
<i>There.</i>

258
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,110
<i>I had what I wanted.</i>

259
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,721
<i>But things took a serious turn</i>
<i>I hadn't counted on.</i>

260
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,916
<i>This girl lacked</i>
<i>the easygoing quality</i>

261
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,391
<i>that would have eased</i>
<i>my conscience.</i>

262
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,291
<i>What had I gotten myself into?</i>

263
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:05,559
<i>Besides, I was leaving Paris.</i>
<i>Not much could happen before then.</i>

264
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:09,296
<i>I had other worries.</i>

265
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:13,499
<i>The next day, a Friday,</i>
<i>I took my oral exam and passed.</i>

266
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,079
<i>I almost didn't go to my date.</i>

267
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,406
<i>But none of my friends</i>
<i>were around,</i>

268
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,073
<i>and the thought of an evening</i>
<i>alone was unbearable.</i>

269
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,955
<i>A cookie.</i>

270
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:52,879
How are you?

271
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,680
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

272
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,514
A bad sprain
that's dragged on three weeks.

273
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,212
How annoying.

274
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,385
I wondered
why I hadn't seen you.

275
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:05,720
I saw you yesterday,
but you were lost in thought.

276
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,228
Really.

277
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:09,956
Let's move.

278
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,032
<i>In an instant</i>
<i>I'd made my decision.</i>

279
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,897
- Have you eaten?
- Not a bite.

280
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,606
- This heat makes me hungry.
- No need to explain.

281
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:19,332
Want to eat together?

282
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:22,706
Why not? I'll just be a minute.
I'm on the second floor.

283
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,844
I'll wait.

284
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,652
<i>That minute turned into 15,</i>

285
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,827
<i>giving me ample opportunity</i>
<i>to reflect on my rashness.</i>

286
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,791
<i>I could have put Sylvie off a day</i>
<i>and kept my date with my bakery girl.</i>

287
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,968
<i>But my choice had been,</i>
<i>above all, a moral one.</i>

288
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,069
<i>Having found Sylvie again,</i>

289
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:51,297
<i>seeing the bakery girl would be</i>
<i>a vice, an aberration.</i>

290
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,203
<i>One represented truth</i>
<i>and the other a mistake,</i>

291
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,177
<i>or so I told myself at the time.</i>

292
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:03,247
<i>To complicate things,</i>

293
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:04,943
<i>it began to rain,</i>

294
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:07,487
<i>but that's what</i>
<i>in fact saved me.</i>

295
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:21,133
<i>... it will be exactly 8:00...</i>

296
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,473
You can't walk.
I'll get a cab.

297
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,078
You won't find one in this rain.
I can walk.

298
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,441
Really?

299
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,346
<i>The street was deserted.</i>

300
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:41,046
<i>The bakery girl could see us</i>
<i>if she came outside.</i>

301
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,055
<i>Like a coward, I thought</i>

302
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,660
<i>she'd be too far away</i>
<i>to make a scene.</i>

303
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,695
<i>I didn't dare turn around,</i>
<i>and the walk seemed endless.</i>

304
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,960
<i>Did she see us, or was she</i>
<i>pining away for me at the café?</i>

305
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,069
<i>I'll never know.</i>

306
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:03,512
<i>As for winning Sylvie,</i>
<i>I already had.</i>

307
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,174
<i>I learned how that very evening.</i>

308
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,681
I managed
to keep myself entertained.

309
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,854
I can't stand people
who pace in front of my door.

310
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,215
Yes, you may not know it,

311
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:16,824
but my windows
open onto the street.

312
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,392
I saw everything.

313
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,523
<i>I trembled a moment,</i>
<i>but she went on.</i>

314
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,460
You're terrible.

315
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,894
You almost made me feel guilty.

316
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,036
But then, I couldn't exactly
call out to you.

317
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,731
After all, it's your right to destroy
your stomach with those awful cookies.

318
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:36,037
- They're good.
- I know. I've tried them.

319
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:39,181
In short,
I know all your vices.

320
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,875
What'll you have?

321
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,145
The chef's special pastry.

322
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:49,086
<i>We were married</i>
<i>six months later,</i>

323
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:53,490
<i>and lived for a while</i>
<i>on the Rue Lebouteux.</i>
