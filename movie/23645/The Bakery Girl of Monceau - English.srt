1
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:21,760
SIX MORAL TALES

2
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:25,969
THE BAKERY GIRL OF MONCEAU

3
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,970
Paris,
the Villiers intersection.

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,538
To the east,
Boulevard des Batignolles.

5
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:47,604
To the north,
Rue de Lévis and its market.

6
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,311
The Dôme de Villiers café.

7
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:56,986
To the left,
Avenue de Villiers.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,358
The Villiers metro station.

9
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:04,165
To the west,
Boulevard de Courcelles,

10
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,564
which leads
to the Park Monceau

11
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,967
and a demolition zone on the site
of the former City Club,

12
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,607
a student residence.

13
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:16,670
I ate there every night
while in law school.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,440
Sylvie, who worked in a gallery
on the Rue de Monceau,

15
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,141
walked home across the park
at the same time.

16
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:29,090
l knew her only by sight.
We passed each other often

17
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,727
between the intersection
and the club.

18
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:34,328
We'd exchanged furtive looks

19
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,021
but nothing more.

20
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:39,066
- Don't look back.
- She's a bit tall for me.

21
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,933
Schmidt, my friend,
urged me to act.

22
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,039
But I was scared.

23
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,767
- Take a chance.
- What, pick her up?

24
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:49,947
- Why not? One never knows.
- Well, one should.

25
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:56,577
No, it wasn't her style
to get picked up on the street,

26
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:59,223
and it was even less
my style to try.

27
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:04,528
Yet I felt she was ready

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,529
to make an exception
to her rule, as I was to mine.

29
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,395
But it was risky,

30
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,833
and I didn't want to botch it
by not being myself.

31
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,038
Really?

32
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,710
Very long?
- Longer than usual.

33
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,175
Listen,
I feel like following her.

34
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,615
No, don't.
Go right up to her.

35
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:24,545
Go right up to her?

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,945
I could see
how strongly I felt about her.

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,955
It was May,
near the end of the school year.

38
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,133
She had to live nearby.

39
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:42,164
We'd seen her a few times

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,305
carrying a basket,
doing her shopping.

41
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,235
- See?
- Not so loud.

42
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,308
What'd I say?

43
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:52,002
She may live around here.

44
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:53,905
- Wait.
- Be careful.

45
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,674
Relax.

46
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,455
She went into a shop.

47
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:19,234
She's ignoring us too intently
to not be aware of us.

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,472
Hell, I'm following her.

49
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:41,860
Even if I’d managed to trail her unseen,
what good would that have done?

50
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,898
I'll catch up.

51
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:51,402
I’d decided to take matters in hand
when fortune at last smiled on me.

52
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:02,951
Over there!

53
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:05,924
- What?
- There!

54
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:12,395
What?

55
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,596
- No harm done.
- Really?

56
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:19,272
- We didn't really bump.
- Thank goodness.

57
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:24,600
What a day. I almost broke
my neck on those things earlier.

58
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,645
- I wish I'd seen that.
- I said almost.

59
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,477
I wasn't hurt.
These cars are so loud!

60
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:32,778
- I go this way.
- I go that way.

61
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:36,287
Let me make amends.
Meet me for coffee in an hour?

62
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:39,551
I'm busy tonight. Another time.
We cross paths often.

63
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:49,498
Throughout our short talk,
I'd had but one thought.

64
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:52,266
Keep her there.
Say anything.

65
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:56,434
Forget the assuredly
poor impression I was making.

66
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,615
But my victory was clear.

67
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:02,147
I must admit, bumping into her
wasn't entirely accidental.

68
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,081
She didn't seem offended.

69
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:07,189
On the contrary,
she seemed to respond.

70
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,383
Her refusal to meet
meant nothing,

71
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:14,827
since now I could speak to her when
we met again, which would be soon.

72
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:20,203
Then, what I least expected
happened.

73
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:24,666
My good luck
was followed by equally bad luck.

74
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,311
Three days passed,
then a week.

75
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:29,310
No sign of her.

76
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:34,009
With exams coming up,
Schmidt went back to his family.

77
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:36,951
In love though I was,

78
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:40,217
the idea of giving up study time
to look for Sylvie

79
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,588
never even occurred to me.

80
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,657
My only free time was meal time,

81
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,594
so I did without dinner.

82
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:55,803
Dinner took 30 minutes,
and my walk three,

83
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:59,445
so my chances of seeing her
were multiplied by 10.

84
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:04,981
But the boulevard seemed
a poor vantage point.

85
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,523
She might easily
take another route.

86
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,489
She might even take
the subway or bus.

87
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:19,328
However, she still had
to go shopping,

88
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:23,368
so I decided to extend the area
of my search to the Rue de Lévis.

89
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:28,599
Besides, I must say,

90
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:33,076
these late-afternoon patrols
were hot, dull and tiring.

91
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,912
The market offered
variety, coolness,

92
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,588
and the compelling
argument of food.

93
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:42,189
My stomach tempted me.

94
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:46,260
Weary of cafeterias,
and anticipating vacation,

95
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:50,193
it craved the gastronomic interlude
that cherry season offered.

96
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,895
The smells and sounds
of the market,

97
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,369
after so many hours
of books and lecture notes,

98
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:01,738
were more relaxing than the club
and its mess-hall odors.

99
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,821
But my search was still in vain.
Thousands lived in that neighborhood...

100
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:22,633
possibly one of
the most crowded in Paris.

101
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:26,368
Should I stay put?

102
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,336
Or walk around?

103
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,808
I was young
and perhaps foolishly hoping

104
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:35,075
to see her suddenly
appear in a window

105
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:37,443
or emerge from a shop

106
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:41,314
and once again find herself
face-to-face with me.

107
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:44,949
So I decided to stroll around.

108
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:57,861
That's how I found,
on the Rue Lebouteux,

109
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:01,136
a little bakery

110
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:04,278
where I got in the habit
of buying the cookies and pastries

111
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,677
that became
the mainstay of my meals.

112
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,376
Go on, Jackie.
Get going, understand?

113
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,116
Let me work.

114
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,227
Oh, that guy!

115
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,055
Girls are useless.

116
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:22,926
You should talk.
Go back where you came from.

117
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,794
I'll be back.

118
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:29,636
What an idiot!

119
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:32,641
A cookie.

120
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,574
He gets on my nerves.

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,278
Which one?
- That one.

122
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,078
To go?

123
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:45,084
That's right.

124
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,686
Forty centimes.

125
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,785
The cookies were the same
as at any bakery.

126
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,982
They're factory-made.
You find them everywhere.

127
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,182
But here I could eat
without being seen by Sylvie,

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,524
who, in the crowded market,
might appear unexpectedly.

129
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,765
Besides, buying my pastry
had become a ritual

130
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,668
between me
and the girl at the bakery.

131
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:44,010
At my age, you hate nothing
more than shopping.

132
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,978
I like to enter a shop

133
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,555
with the air of someone
going in for the first time.

134
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:55,327
Yet I’m pleased when the salesgirl
guesses my game and plays along.

135
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,228
Hello, miss.
A cookie.

136
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,006
Forty centimes?

137
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:33,463
And still no sign of Sylvie.

138
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:36,162
Was she avoiding me?
Why, for God's sake?

139
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,135
Was she in the country?

140
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:40,675
Sick? Dead? Married?

141
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,104
Anything was possible.

142
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:47,148
By the end of the week,
my vigil was a mere formality.

143
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:49,178
l would hurry to my bakery,

144
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:51,951
taking more care each day
with my entrances,

145
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,853
my lingering,
my bizarre conduct.

146
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:08,404
Two cookies?

147
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:19,512
Darn!

148
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,484
Don't worry.
Oh, and wrap them separately.

149
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,552
There.

150
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:37,269
Wait. I think
I've got the change.

151
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:16,174
It didn't take long to see
the pretty bakery girl liked me.

152
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,644
Call it vanity if you will,

153
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,683
but the fact that a girl liked me
seemed natural.

154
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,682
And since she wasn't
really my type,

155
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,858
and Sylvie alone,

156
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,890
so superior,
held my thoughts --

157
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,618
Yes, it was because
I was thinking of Sylvie

158
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,526
that I accepted the advances,
which is what they were,

159
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,098
of the bakery girl.

160
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,237
in a much better spirit
than if I had not loved another.

161
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:53,313
Yes, a cookie.

162
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,987
And a roll.

163
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,454
And, let's see,
give me that one.

164
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:05,728
Wait.

165
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,594
What's that called?

166
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,429
A Gâteau Lorrain.

167
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,633
Anything else?

168
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,001
That's all.

169
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,151
Separately?

170
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,855
Yes. But not the cookie.

171
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,961
Wait.

172
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,325
Give me an apricot tart.

173
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,515
I got more involved
in this by the day,

174
00:13:53,717 --> 00:13:56,277
sure that it couldn't go very far.

175
00:13:56,487 --> 00:14:00,685
And it was as good a way as any
both to pass the time

176
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:03,383
and to get even with Sylvie
for her absence.

177
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:15,197
And yet this revenge
seemed unworthy of me,

178
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:19,275
and I ended up taking out
my irritation on the bakery girl.

179
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:22,810
What upset me
was not that she liked me,

180
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:25,245
but that she'd think
there was any way

181
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,351
I would like her.

182
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,714
As if to justify myself
in my own eyes,

183
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:32,322
l told myself it was her fault,

184
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,653
that she must be punished
for playing with fire.

185
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:43,459
My courtship became a daily routine
carried out with such a relaxed air

186
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:47,940
that her initial coyness
didn't put me off at all.

187
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:51,407
Delicious.
I could eat nothing but pastries.

188
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,136
Me too.

189
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,979
I'll buy you one.

190
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:04,352
No, thank you.

191
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,924
Come on.

192
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,154
Isn't the boss here?

193
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:10,694
She's making dinner.

194
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,764
So what are you afraid of?

195
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,348
I'd think you'd hate pastries
after staring at them all day.

196
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,155
I've only been here a month.

197
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,893
I won't be here long,
you know.

198
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:43,823
In September I start
at one of the big department stores.

199
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,797
You're here all day long?

200
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,101
Until 8:00.

201
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,372
What do you do evenings?

202
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,941
Would you like
to go out some evening?

203
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,085
I'm only 18.

204
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:17,202
So? Don't your parents
Let you go out?

205
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:30,744
It was an apricot tart
and a baba,

206
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,748
and add an apple tart.

207
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:38,321
My exams were almost over.
I’d be going on vacation.

208
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,627
- Want any help?
- Heavens, no.

209
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,988
Am I bothering you?
Afraid we'll be seen?

210
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,961
No. Anyway,
I'm leaving in a month.

211
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:49,896
- Mind if I walk with you a bit?
- I guess not.

212
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,800
Come in here.
I want to tell you something.

213
00:16:57,612 --> 00:16:59,604
Have I done something wrong?

214
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:02,113
No. I told you,
it's not that.

215
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:06,314
Let's go out.

216
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:07,386
Tomorrow.

217
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,023
Leave me alone.

218
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:10,213
Why?

219
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,018
I don't know you.

220
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,256
We'll get acquainted.

221
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:16,227
Do I seem so bad?

222
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,600
No strings attached.

223
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:22,098
We'll go to a movie
on the Champs-Elysées.

224
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:25,240
You must go to the movies.
- Yes, on Saturday.

225
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,208
Let's go this Saturday.

226
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,843
I'm going with friends.

227
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:30,034
Boys?

228
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,977
Boys... girls.
They're all silly.

229
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,045
All the more reason.
Saturday then?

230
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,654
No, not Saturday.

231
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,949
Another day.
Do your parents keep you in?

232
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:42,625
I should hope not!

233
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:44,090
So tomorrow?

234
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:47,459
We'll have a nice dinner,
then go to the Champs-Elysées.

235
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,634
I'll meet you at 8:00 at the café.

236
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,769
The Dôme, all right?

237
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,735
Should I dress?

238
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,603
No, you're fine as you are.
All right?

239
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,143
Mother may not like it.

240
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,779
But you said --

241
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,711
Yes, in principle.

242
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,579
Say it's a girlfriend.

243
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,516
I don't know.
Maybe.

244
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,657
Do you like a little intrigue?

245
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,352
Intrigue.

246
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,496
I'll come by tomorrow at 7:30.

247
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,360
In case we can't talk in the bakery,
here's what we'll do.

248
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,627
I'll ask for a pastry.

249
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,738
If you give me two,
it's a go.

250
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,667
In that case we'll meet
at the café at 8:00. Got it?

251
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,249
Repeat it back
so there's no mistake.

252
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,042
If I give you two pastries,
it means yes.

253
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,651
Good. I'll leave now.

254
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:43,346
I'll go first.

255
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,123
What's your name?

256
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:46,885
Good-bye, Jacqueline.

257
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:48,623
There.

258
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,422
I had what I wanted.

259
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:54,033
But things took a serious turn
I hadn't counted on.

260
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:57,228
This girl lacked
the easygoing quality

261
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,705
that would have eased
my conscience.

262
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:01,604
What had I gotten myself into?

263
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,872
Besides, I was leaving Paris.
Not much could happen before then.

264
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,609
I had other worries.

265
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,813
The next day, a Friday,
I took my oral exam and passed.

266
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,392
I almost didn't go to my date.

267
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:18,720
But none of my friends
was around,

268
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,388
and the thought of an evening
alone was unbearable.

269
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,270
A cookie.

270
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:53,195
How are you?

271
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:55,996
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

272
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,830
A bad sprain
that's dragged on three weeks.

273
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,528
How annoying.

274
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,703
I wondered
why I hadn't seen you.

275
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,037
I saw you yesterday,
but you were lost in thought.

276
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,545
Really.

277
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:10,273
Let's move.

278
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:12,349
In an instant
I’d made my decision.

279
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:15,215
- Have you eaten?
- Not a bite.

280
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,923
- This heat makes me hungry.
- No need to explain.

281
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,650
Want to eat together?

282
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,024
Why not? I’ll just be a minute.
I'm on the second floor.

283
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,163
I'll wait.

284
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,971
That minute turned into 15,

285
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:38,145
giving me ample opportunity
to reflect on my rashness.

286
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:43,110
I could have put Sylvie off a day
and kept my date with my bakery girl.

287
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:46,287
But my choice had been,
above all, a moral one.

288
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,389
Having found Sylvie again,

289
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:51,617
seeing the bakery girl would be
a vice, an aberration.

290
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:53,522
One represented truth
and the other a mistake,

291
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:57,498
or so I told myself at the time.

292
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,568
To complicate things,

293
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:05,264
it began to rain,

294
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:07,807
but that's what
in fact saved me.

295
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:21,455
...it will be exactly 8.00...

296
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:28,795
You can't walk.
I'll get a cab.

297
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:31,400
You won't find one in this rain.
I can walk.

298
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:32,764
Really?

299
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,668
The street was deserted.

300
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:41,369
The bakery girl could see us
if she came outside.

301
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,378
Like a coward, I thought

302
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:45,982
she'd be too far away
to make a scene.

303
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:50,018
I didn't dare turn around,
and the walk seemed endless.

304
00:21:50,223 --> 00:21:53,284
Did she see us, or was she
pining away for me at the café?

305
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:55,393
I’ll never know.

306
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:03,837
As for winning Sylvie,
I already had.

307
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:06,499
I learned how that very evening.

308
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:09,005
I managed
to keep myself entertained.

309
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,179
I can't stand people
who pace in front of my door.

310
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,540
Yes, you may not know it,

311
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,150
but my windows
open onto the street.

312
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:18,717
I saw everything.

313
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,848
I trembled a moment,
but she went on.

314
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:23,786
You're terrible.

315
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,220
You almost made me feel guilty.

316
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:29,362
But then, I couldn't exactly
call out to you.

317
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,056
After all, it's your right to destroy
your stomach with those awful cookies.

318
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,363
- They're good.
- I know. I've tried them.

319
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,508
In short,
I know all your vices.

320
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,201
What'll you have?

321
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,473
The chef's special pastry.

322
