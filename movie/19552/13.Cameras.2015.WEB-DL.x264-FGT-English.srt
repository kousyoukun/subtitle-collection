wants to do before the baby
comes,

137
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,724
so, I come home,
and I paint rooms,

138
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,860
or look at furniture,

139
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,195
I watch those
house renovation shows

140
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,729
and she tells me
what she likes,

141

and I smile and nod,
and we don't fight.

It doesn't sound that bad.

143

and that's pretty much it.

not having sex?

[Chuckles]
take a wild guess.

146
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,478

you'll poke the baby.

Why is it always so much better
in the beginning?

have to keep pretending

Hold on,
let me catch her.

484
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,648
-What're you doing?
-She called me,

485
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,183
she asked me to come here.

486
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,418
Yeah, maybe you wanna
call me next time?

487
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,753
You were in Santa Barbara.

488
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,654
How could you be
so fucking reckless?

489
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,691
Look, it would have been weirder
if I didn't come here at all.

490
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,561
What're you trying to do?

491
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,330
Nothing.

492
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,168
All right.
We'll tomorrow.

493
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,404
She's pregnant.

494
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,509
Well, it's not like
it's a big fucking secret.

495
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,511
You've got to tell her.

496
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,079
Go home.

497
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,282
All right,
see you then.

498
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,654
All righty,
what are we eating?

499
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,457
-She's pretty.
-Think so?

500
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:24,294
-How was your day?
-Good. Busy.

501
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:27,297
I ran some errands,
and I got a few things
for the nursery.

502
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,166
The baby's getting
spoiled already.

503
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,835
He better be.

504
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,570
You said
she wasn't pretty.

505
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,472
Did I?

506
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,441
She's a good assistant.

507
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,676
She's sweet.

508
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,312
She's like
a baywatch model, though.

509
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,548
You've got nothing
to worry about, okay?

510
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,450
I'm not worried.

511
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:47,551
I'm just fat.

512
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,352
You're not fat.

513
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,456
You're pregnant.
Come here.

514
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,526
I love you.
Okay?

515
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,295
I love you, too.

Are you out of your mind?

00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,729
Oh, my god!
Woo.

523
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,400
Yeah, I'd like to block
a phone number, please.

524
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,303
From both phones
on the plan.

525
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:50,273
It's 323-555-5359.

526
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,876
That will go into effect
immediately?

527
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,878
How long does it take?

528
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,313
All right.

529
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,481
Okay, fine.

-What's wrong?
-Lots of work stuff.

531
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,820
I almost singed my eyebrows off
with this fucking thing.

532
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,488
Huh?

533
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,259
What's going on?

534
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:12,596
Nothing,
it's complicated.

536
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,000
I've been seeing someone.

What?

00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,440
[Sighs] my assistant.

539
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,612
What are you
fucking kidding me?
Since when?

540
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:32,482
Since I moved out here.

541
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,817
What are you thinking?

542
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,318
I don't know.

543
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,420
It just kind of happened.

544
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,923
I was out here on my own,
and things were bad with Claire,

545
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,992
-and it just happened.
-And kept happening?

It's getting out of control.

547
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,829
You've got to tell her.

What, are you
fucking crazy?

549
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:51,268
I'm trying to fix this,
not throw it away.

550
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,370
She came to the house
yesterday.

551
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:54,804
She called
Claire's phone.

552

What?

553
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,576
She's trying
to fuck up my marriage.
