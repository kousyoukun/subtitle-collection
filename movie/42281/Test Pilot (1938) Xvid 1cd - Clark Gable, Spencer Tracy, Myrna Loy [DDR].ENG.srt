1
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:26,767
There she is,
Mr. Drake.

2
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:30,300
You mean to tell me there's not
Even that much more to do to her?

3
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,334
Not a whisper.

4
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,033
All the years and all the
Wrecks and all the schemes,

5
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,801
And out of it grows
This sweet peach.

6
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, and she's going to
Crack that record by an hour.

7
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,200
You can go and hang it
On your wall right now.

8
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,667
And up high,
Gunner-

9
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,167
Up where the storms
Can't touch her-

10
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:52,801
Out of their reach.

11
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,767
Something more than
A record, eh, gunner?

12
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,434
She'll spit on
Those mountains.

13
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,267
Yes, she will.

14
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:02,434
If she wasn't such
A lady, she would.

15
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,901
How's Lane feeling?

16
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,467
He's been asleep
About 3 hours.

17
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,968
Uh-huh. 12:00. He's got
To take off at 1:00 sharp.

18
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,968
Yeah. I'll wake him
In about a half-hour.

19
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,234
Oh, yeah. Let him
Have all he can.

20
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,734
Lane
Still asleep?

22
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,300
We won't pay him the 750
Without his cross on this.

24
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,801
And you won't pay him if
You don't break the record.

25
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:20,634
Sure. The ad's no good if
He don't break the record.

26
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,934
We're selling gasoline.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,033
Get out. Give me air,
Will you?

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,300
Air? Is that what you're
Asking for, gunner?

29
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,801
Have a little on me.

30
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,267
Everything grounded
West of albuquerque.

31
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:28,934
Just what you've
Been waiting for.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,801
And look what's waiting
For him over colorado.

33
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,467
It's all right.
He won't be there long.

34
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:33,467
Let me know the minute
He wakes up, will you?

35
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:34,601
All right.
He'll be here.

36
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:35,634
He ain't going
Anywhere else.

37
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:36,801
I wouldn't
Put it past him.

38
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,467
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,567
Hey! Where's Lane?

40
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,434
Yeah, where? I had a
Date with him at 10:00.

41
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,934
You're telling me
Where.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,901
When'd you see him?

43
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:02,267
I'm telling you,
I haven't seen him!

44
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,267
How long you been here? Since 9:00.

45
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,734
When'd you
Fall asleep?

46
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,434
I don't know. What
Difference does it make?

47
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,601
Don't get so tough about it. I'll
Tell you what difference it makes.

48
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,934
He left for home here 3 hours ago.
I want to know if he's been here.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,467
What time is it?
12:00.

50
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:13,934
I was awake at 11:00, I know that.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,100
Then he hasn't
Been here.

52
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,567
Who are you? The guy
Called gunner?

53
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,567
Yeah, and I'm telling you, you
Can't let him out of your sight.

54
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,100
What are you
Telling me for?

55
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,934
I ain't ever seen
So much of him.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,434
You don't think
Anything happened to him?

57
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,601
An accident
Or something?

58
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:25,601
Quiet!

59
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,133
Yeah, an accident-
Another dame.

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,300
Oh, yeah. Hello,
Gunner, old boy.

61
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,300
Look what I rescued.
Dying of thirst, she said.

62
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,767
Hello, pal. Everything
All right with you?

63
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,767
What's your name?

64
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:36,968
Sarah.

65
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,634
Oh? Her name is mable.
Mable, this is sarah.

66
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,434
And this is the gunner. And this
Is all a very unexpected pleasure,

67
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,100
And I'm very glad
To know all of you.

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,501
Do you know
What time it is?

69
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:45,968
Yeah. Time to go to bed. You
Told me that two hours ago.

70
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,501
What do you want to keep
Repeating yourself for?

71
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,968
Come on, girls. Blow.
Get out of here.

72
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,567
I won't go out
With that.

73
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:51,901
Girls, girls.

74
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:53,767
Look, this guy's
Got to get some sleep.

75
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,601
Get out of here
Before I throw you out.

76
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,567
Come on. Remember, you girls
Were with me if anybody asks.

77
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,934
Girls are
Always quarreling.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,100
Girls don't get on good for some reason.

79
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,234
Girls, girls.

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,267
The dear old girls.

81
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:16,567
Jim.
Yeah?

82
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,801
Ok. Where are
My clothes? Oh.

83
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,901
I don't know
How you do it.

84
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,100
How'd she wind?

85
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,634
2,762.

86
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,934
Good. She ought to bust in my face
Before I get her off the ground.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,934
Yeah. Just like
Those dames of yours.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,100
What dames?

89
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,100
Oh, lord.

90
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,400
How's the weather?

91
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,167
You got a 62-mile tailwind
At 20,000 feet.

92
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,234
How's the weather?

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,234
You got a 78-mile tailwind
At 25,000 feet.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,033
Yeah? How's that storm over
Colorado? Who you trying to kid?

95
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,133
Ah, what's a little weather
To the Drake bullet?

96
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh, Drake's got a new
Name for her now.

97
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,767
Calls her
His sweet peach.

98
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,267
Yeah? Don't tell
Colorado that.

99
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,934
Don't you worry.
She'll hold.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,267
Yeah. I love you guys
That know all about it.

101
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:03,267
Sure. If you crack up,
You can blame me.

102
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,767
Mm-hmm. I get that
Out of it.

103
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,734
Every time I see a crash
Coming, I know it isn't my fault.

104
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,934
That makes it
All right, too.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,300
Sure, sure.

106
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,100
Thank you.
Thank you.

107
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,100
Well, once
Again, Jim.

108
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,267
Yep.

109
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:20,267
She's in shape.
Like a peach?

110
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:21,767
That's right.
That's right.

111
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,267
She may leave a little
Fuzz along the way,

112
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,767
But she'll keep that
Schoolgirl complexion.

113
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,968
This is more than
Just a record, Jim.

114
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,734
It means a whole lot
To aviation.

115
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,434
I never heard of it.
I'm doing it for you, pal.

116
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,467
Well, see you tomorrow. All right.

117
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:36,667
In you go.

118
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,801
Go on and break
The record!

119
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:50,133
Take it easy now. Remember, you got
4,200 pounds of gas in this crate.

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,133
Yeah. I'd have never
Thought of that.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,901
If I don't see you again,
It'll be too soon.

122
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:57,734
Yeah, and if I never see
That ugly map of yours again,

123
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,267
It'll be too soon.

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,968
Do I look like you?

125
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,467
Huh?

126
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:54,701
Well, they're both good.
I'll say that for them.

127
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:58,200
What are you going to do
For the next 5 or 6 hours?

128
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,067
Look like
You're looking.

129
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,567
Well, come on.
Let's look together.

130
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,634
Are you all right?

131
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,634
Are you all right?

132
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:00,934
I'm licked, see? I'm licked! I
Couldn't move this thing with a derrick.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Oh. That's too bad.

134
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,133
"that's too bad."
Is it really?

135
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,300
All I had was a coast to coast
Record, and it's too bad.

136
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,734
Don't you understand?
I had it licked to death.

137
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,234
Why, I had it right in my
Hand, just like that wrench.

138
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,467
And now you haven't
Even got the wrench.

139
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,300
Say, where are we?

140
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,767
We are in kansas.

141
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,275
That's great.
How near wichita?

142
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:22,267
About 20 miles.

143
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,801
I'll tell you what you can do
For me. Do you live around here?

144
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:24,767
Right there.

145
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,467
You got a phone?
Yes.

146
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,067
All right. Go call the union
Air terminal at burbank.

147
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,133
Ask for gunner morris. When you get
Him, just yell down, and I'll come.

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,167
Johnny morris?

149
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,534
Gunner! Gunner.

150
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:35,767
Just ask for gunner. Tell
Him I'm calling. I'm Jim Lane.

151
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,133
That's all
You have to do.

152
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,667
Why don't you
Call him yourself?

153
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,167
Hey, I got to get
These lines out of here.

154
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,334
You don't think I want to be stuck
In this dump all night, do you?

155
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,934
I don't care very much
One way or the other.

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,167
All right, all right!
I'll pay for it.

157
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,133
Don't worry about that.

158
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,501
Listen, swellhead, you're
On private property,

159
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,100
And very uninvited.

160
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,434
How'd you like to get
That junk over the fence

161
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,801
Before I sic
A bull on you?

162
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,133
Say, I'm just in the mood
For a bull, sister.

163
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,501
You go get him. I'm liable to pick him
Up and throw him right back in your lap.

164
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:11,834
I know you.
You're the prince-

165
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,167
A nice,
Charming prince,

166
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,968
Right out of
The sky-

167
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,334
A young girl's
Dream.

168
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,000
And I've been waiting
For you all my life.

169
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,334
That's why no other man ever
Touched the tip of my finger.

170
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,467
I have lived
For a prince.

171
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:34,334
What's the matter?
Too much for you?

172
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,667
You're a funny-looking gazabo.

173
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:41,667
Yeah.

174
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:44,167
Are you a famous
Flier, Mr. Lane?

175
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,801
Why, I'm Jim Lane.

176
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,634
Should I faint
On that one?

177
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,133
Say, where
Do you live?

178
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,834
I still live there. I haven't
Moved since I told you.

179
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,968
Can I use your phone?

180
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:02,634
It's all right with me if
It's all right with the phone.

181
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,667
What's your name?

182
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:08,567
Ann barton.

183
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:10,767
And we're near wichita, are we, ann?

184
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,601
And it's still
20 miles.

185
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,267
That's right. You told me
That before, too, didn't you?

186
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,601
What time is it?

187
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,801
About 6:00.

188
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:19,801
Didn't ask you that
Before, did I?

189
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:22,133
No. Don't
Startle me so.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,133
Do all the girls around
Here look like you

191
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,467
This early
In the morning?

192
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,801
Every girl I've ever seen this ear-

193
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:30,601
Yeah. Look at
All the hay.

194
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,133
That's wheat.

195
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,801
Oh.

196
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,434
The staff of life.

197
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,467
Is it?

198
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,834
It's nice here
At that, isn't it?

199
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,934
I'm so glad
You like it.

200
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:44,801
How many waffles
Can you eat, Mr. Lane?

201
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:45,834
How many
Have you got?

202
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,133
That's all
I want to know.

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Come along.
Keep following me.

204
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:54,267
Hey, where did you get such
A nice father and mother?

205
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,267
I took time
Picking them out.

206
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh.

207
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:01,601
Say, this is a pretty
Room. This your room?

208
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,067
No. This is
The spare room.

209
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,901
Oh. This is where I'd
Stay if I were a guest.

210
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:08,067
That's right...

211
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,934
If you were
Stuck here.

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,100
Hmm.

213
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:14,934
Oh.

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,934
What's the matter?

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,601
No towels.
I'm stuck.

216
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:18,801
Oh, dear.

217
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:21,000
You're not supposed
To say "oh, dear."

218
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,934
You should say,
"that's all right."

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,334
I've been around here too long
Now not to say what I mean.

220
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,634
Quite an imagination
For an aviator.

221
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:32,300
Can't match yours, pal.
You went to school.

222
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,968
I didn't
Learn it there.

223
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,467
Don't get lost.

224
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:38,634
No, no. I won't.

225
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,834
Ann keeps all those
Records in the books.

226
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,267
Ann went to school.

227
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,267
Smart. Ann graduated from the
State university, Mr. Lane,

228
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,601
With the highest
Honors.

229
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,601
Didn't you, ann?

230
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,067
Oh, you bet.

231
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,767
I broke all records.

232
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,067
Did you go
To college, Mr. Lane?

233
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,100
Ha ha ha!

234
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,767
Why, ann!
Why, mother!

235
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,300
She's crazy. I broke
All records, too.

236
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,434
I entered high school a
Sophomore and came out a freshman.

237
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,467
Have you been a test pilot ever since?

238
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,467
No. I was in the army for a
While, but we didn't agree.

239
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:27,734
Had to get up
Too early?

240
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,267
No. Had to
Go to bed.

241
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,734
That must be
Your call.

242
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:34,334
Yeah, thanks. No wisecracks
Now. I beat you to it.

243
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,300
He's
A charming man.

244
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:38,300
Uh-huh.

245
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:41,300
Yeah. Yeah?

246
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

247
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:49,501
The oil pump let go. He's
Down ok on a farm near wichita.

248
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,667
Well, that's
The way it goes.

249
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,033
Yeah.

250
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,467
And bring along a whole new
Assembly and the center line.

251
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,767
Yeah. Wait.
I'll find out.

252
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,801
Oh, ann?

253
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,334
Who's ann?

254
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,834
Yes?

255
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:07,434
Will anyone in wichita with a cab
Know how to get here all right?

256
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,767
Oh, sure. Due west of wichita
On the main highway.

257
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,934
Everybody knows
The barton farm.

258
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,400
Oh, sure. Due west of
Wichita on the main highway.

259
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,200
Everybody knows
The barton farm.

260
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,801
What's all this
"ann" stuff?

261
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,767
Listen, have you got all
That dope now, or haven't you?

262
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,767
What time will you
Get in wichita?

263
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,767
I'll hop the first trip east.
The weather's cleared.

264
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,467
Wichita? Wait a minute.

265
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,467
5:30 your time.

266
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,033
Why do you always have to
Land way out in the sticks?

267
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, this isn't
The sticks, lad.

268
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,300
This is the prettiest farm I ever saw.

269
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,434
Wait'll you see it. The
Wheat sways in the field

270
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,634
Like a silken sea.

271
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,834
How's that?

272
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,601
Sounds like a blond.

273
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,367
Listen, don't fool around
There all afternoon.

274
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:50,601
Get that old pump out of there, will you,
So I can put the new one in right away?

275
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,100
Maybe we can pull
Out of there tonight.

276
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,901
Oh, sure. Sure. I'll
Work on it all afternoon.

277
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,767
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

278
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,267
All afternoon.

279
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,434
Yeah. Ok. Good-bye.

280
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,734
All set. Have we
Got a car?

281
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,267
Yes. Why?

282
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,234
We got to go to wichita, haven't we?

283
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Oh.

284
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:11,901
We got to meet the gunner, haven't we?

285
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:15,100
Oh. And he arrives
There when?

286
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,934
Around 5:00
This afternoon.

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,934
And in the meanwhile?

288
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,901
I'll entertain you
There.

289
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:23,567
Oh. I thought you
Had to work here.

290
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,100
Oh, no, no.
That's hard work.

291
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,634
Come on.
Come on, pal.

292
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,434
We're wasting time.
Wichita is calling.

293
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:29,767
Here. Come on.

294
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,267
And wear that
Red dress, will you?

295
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:32,467
What?

296
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,434
How did you know
I had a red dress?

297
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,334
Oh, I got
In the wrong room.

298
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:44,734
Good-bye, father.
Good-bye, mother.

299
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,133
Bye. You all be back
For supper?

300
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,100
We will.

301
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,133
And, Mr. Lane?

302
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,300
Yes, mother?

303
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,801
I'll have a cot all
Fixed up for your friend.

304
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:52,367
All right, mother. And
The towels are in the hall.

305
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:53,367
What?

306
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:54,601
Shh! Shut up!

307
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:02,367
Horseshoe!
Horseshoe!

308
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:05,234
Beautiful!
Beautiful!

309
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,267
Oh!

310
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:09,601
You can see now why wichita's
Going to win this league.

311
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,734
What's that
You say, lady?

312
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:12,234
Wichita's going to
Win what?

313
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,901
It's in the bag, omaha,
And you're holding it.

314
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,067
Yeah. That was
A smart play, eh?

315
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,868
The smartest play you've
Seen today, mister.

316
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,868
Ask your pitcher what's
The last thing he expected,

317
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,534
And he'll tell you
A hit and run.

318
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,033
What a beauty!

319
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,767
Two outs,
A man on first,

320
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,868
And 3 and 1
On the batter. Yeah.

321
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,100
And that second baseman
Isn't surprised much.

322
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,167
Look at him! He can't
Get over it!

323
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,033
I think this guy is right.
It was horseshoed.

324
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,033
Why, sure. Listen. See, it's the
Luckiest ball club in the business.

325
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,934
It's kept them up there
All year.

326
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,767
What's the matter,
Second baseman?

327
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,534
Can't you get over
The surprise?

328
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:46,300
I see what you mean. You mean wichita's
Been getting breaks like this all year?

329
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,968
All year. I never seen
Anything like that.

330
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,601
Your girl
Is just prejudiced.

331
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:55,534
Women don't know anything
About baseball, anyway.

332
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,801
What's all this?

333
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,267
Watch the game, pal.
Watch the game.

334
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,133
There they are.

335
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,267
Yeah. We're
Just in time.

336
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,601
I love you.

337
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,267
"I love you, too."

338
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:20,267
I love you, too.

339
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:24,434
Shh!

340
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:36,634
Look, Jim. Look at that.
Look at that!

341
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,767
Could you do that?

342
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,601
Will you stop? Look at
All the space he's taking.

343
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,968
Well, there's
Plenty of it.

344
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:47,968
Come on.

345
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,000
Where?

346
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,167
Never mind.

347
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,701
How do you like it?

348
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,200
Oh, it's great!

349
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,334
Whoo!

350
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, that was
Wonderful!

351
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,834
Simply wonderful.

352
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:47,801
Oh!

353
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:48,834
Whoops!

354
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:50,133
Take it easy, pal. Take it easy.

355
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,667
You all right?

356
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:55,801
Oh, yes.
I'm all right.

357
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,300
But I'm all right now.

358
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,300
Oh!

359
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,434
Thanks, ray.
Whoa! Whoa.

360
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,667
Well!

361
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,701
Hello, darling.

362
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,701
I'm in no mood
For gags.

363
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,133
Shake hands
With ann instead.

364
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,968
Oh, you only got
One this time, huh?

365
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,100
Where's mable?

366
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,801
She must have seen
Your picture somewhere.

367
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,267
Hello, hello, hello.

368
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,133
Where did you
See each other?

369
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,133
I picked her off a cloud
And got dizzy. Come on.

370
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Thanks, pal.

371
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:27,634
Hey.

372
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:28,601
What?

373
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,334
Do you know what
I'm thinking about?

374
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,167
Am I in it?

375
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:35,667
It's a wish.

376
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:39,000
Ohh. What?

377
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,834
That it was
This morning again.

378
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,501
Could you do it all over again tomorrow?

379
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,000
Could you?

380
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:49,501
I never had a better
Time, ann. And you?

381
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,501
The best.

382
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,601
There's a new show
There tonight.

383
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,601
Where?

384
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,067
Wichita.

385
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,767
Oh. How about
Your friend?

386
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,100
You want him
To go with us?

387
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,467
No.

388
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,467
You're going to have
A nice sleep tonight, pal.

389
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,267
Yeah.

390
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,968
Did you get
That pump off? No.

391
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:16,968
No, I didn't.

392
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,300
That's fine.
That's fine.

393
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:19,801
I had to go to wichita, didn't I?

394
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:20,801
Oh, sure. Sure.

395
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:21,801
I had to meet you,
Didn't I?

396
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:22,801
Oh, yeah. Sure.

397
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:23,801
I didn't want you
To get lost, did I?

398
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:24,968
No, no, no, no.

399
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,133
Be a little
Grateful then.

400
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,634
Grate-for what?

401
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,133
Aren't you glad
To meet ann?

402
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,634
Sure, I'm glad
To meet ann.

403
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:31,601
Sure, I'm gl-

404
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:32,667
Ha ha!

405
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,334
Any chance of getting
Out of here tonight?

406
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,667
Nah. Not a chance. Wait'll
You see where she lives.

407
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:43,300
Oh, a little house sailing along
All by itself in a sea of wheat.

408
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,000
And a cute little cot
For you to sleep on.

409
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,334
Yeah. And wait'll you
Smell them honeysuckles.

410
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,267
Don't give me that banjo. What
Time can we get out tomorrow?

411
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,901
Well, I'm ready
Whenever you are.

412
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:58,300
That's all I wanted to know.
We're leaving early.

413
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:03,334
You usually at least bring
The ship home when you flop,

414
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,467
But maybe you ain't
Jim Lane after all.

415
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,167
Ok, chicago. Should've
Been with me this morning.

416
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:10,167
Had them colorado
Mountains melting.

417
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,467
And tomorrow morning, I'll
Have that ship in new york

418
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,434
Before you can
Pack up your tools.

419
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:20,934
Oh.

420
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,300
What?

421
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,767
Joe.

422
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,133
Oh.

423
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,133
My sweetheart.

424
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,467
Oh. This is new.
She's got a sweetheart.

425
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,801
Yeah.

426
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,267
And he's
Sweet, too.

427
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,300
I wonder what
He's doing here.

428
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,133
He's probably here
To see you.

429
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,133
Yes.

430
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,868
Tell him he'll
Do better tomorrow.

431
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,000
Hello!

432
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,200
Hello.

433
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:46,501
Hello, Mr. Lane. You look
Just the way you ought to.

434
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:47,467
Hi, Joe.

435
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:48,834
Joe, this
Is gunner.

436
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:49,834
Hello.

437
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,334
Hello, Joe.
Glad to see you.

438
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,734
Gee, you
Had me worried.

439
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,133
I thought you'd forgotten about tonight.

440
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,767
Oh. Is it tonight?

441
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,734
Yes. Did you
Forget?

442
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,667
We're having
A dance, Mr. Lane.

443
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,801
Wouldn't you both
Like to come?

444
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:05,367
No. I'm afraid
We can't get away.

445
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,434
I'll get you
Some nice girl.

446
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,601
I don't think
They'd like it.

447
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:12,434
Come on.
Wait for me, Joe.

448
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,300
Oh, thanks for
A lovely afternoon.

449
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,467
Yes, sir. Ain't noplace
Like the country.

450
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:26,634
Hear them sounds
And smell them smells.

451
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,300
Hmm. Honeysuckle.

452
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,834
Honeysuckle
And raspberries.

453
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,934
Hello.

454
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,968
Oh, hello, Mr. Lane.
Are you still up?

455
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,934
Hello.
How are you?

456
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,067
What have you
Been doing?

457
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:15,901
Sitting here
And thinking.

458
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,734
Oh.

459
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,234
It's nice here.

460
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,934
Yes, it is
Nice here.

461
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And she's decided to stay
At last, haven't you, ann?

462
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,767
Where was she going?

463
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,801
I was going
To the moon.

464
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,267
Mr. Lane will
Tell you about that.

465
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,300
He's been nearer
Than you have.

466
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,100
Uh, what is
The altitude record?

467
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,133
I don't know. It changes all the time.

468
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,234
What's all
The smiling about?

469
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,968
I've been trying to win ann
For a long time, Mr. Lane,

470
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:52,634
But she very frankly told
Me she wanted someone better,

471
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,267
And my understanding
Of that

472
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,300
Is probably why
I won her tonight.

473
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,200
I don't get you.

474
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,167
We're going to
Be married.

475
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,167
All right. All right.

476
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:08,067
The prince
Is puzzled.

477
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,434
What do you call him
The prince for?

478
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,267
Well, isn't he?

479
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,567
They used to ride white
Horses over some hill,

480
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:17,234
But nowadays they go so
Fast, they can't see straight.

481
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,934
Gee whiz, they go right
Around the world like that

482
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,934
Until they're right back over the hill

483
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Where they
Started.

484
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:25,434
Do you know
What she means?

485
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,467
No.

486
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:27,734
I don't either.

487
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:32,133
When she talks like this,
Mr. Lane, I just let her go.

488
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,634
Now, Joe, kiss me
Good night.

489
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:35,634
I'm tired.

490
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:36,767
Right.

491
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,801
Good night, Mr. Lane,
And good-bye.

492
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,100
Good night, Joe.
Good luck.

493
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,501
Thanks.

494
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,267
Good night, dear.

495
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:45,968
Good night.

496
00:26:56,801 --> 00:27:00,434
She must have heard that talk
About a horse, and she's sore.

497
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,234
Good night!

498
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,767
Good night.

499
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,434
He's a nice fellow.

500
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,434
Did anyone ever
Nickname you "nice"?

501
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,601
No. Why?

502
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,434
It seems to be
Your favorite word.

503
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,634
He's still
A nice fellow.

504
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,767
And you think I made
A nice choice.

505
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:32,400
This is the life.

506
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,267
Sitting out here tonight's
The first time

507
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:37,601
I've ever felt peace
Since I was born.

508
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,567
It's a nice life.

509
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:43,767
I mean, it's fine.
Hey, you're a flip, girl.

510
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,634
Ha ha ha!

511
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,400
You're charming.

512
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,234
Yeah.

513
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,567
You turn your head like
A big bear and just gaze.

514
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:57,901
It looks as if you
Were making up your mind

515
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,400
Whether you'd jump
At somebody or not,

516
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:04,267
And then you just
Decide not to.

517
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:07,467
It's very charming.

518
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:08,467
Mm-hmm.

519
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:10,167
You've got me
Watching for it

520
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:12,400
And thinking up things
To make you do it.

521
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,400
Look.

522
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,801
I'll show you.

523
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,434
I'm you.

524
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,434
And somebody
Says something,

525
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,167
And you go, "hmm?"

526
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, if that isn't going out of
Your way to get a laugh, I ask you.

527
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:34,934
Hey!

528
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,934
There. Ha ha! That's the way you do it.

529
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,167
Sure.

530
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:44,834
I'd go out of my way
Any day to get that.

531
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,801
What are you going to
Marry that guy for?

532
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,467
You don't love him.

533
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:51,934
What makes you
Suddenly say that?

534
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,234
Just the way
You're behaving now-

535
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,501
Like a little flirt.

536
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,033
I don't like you
For saying that.

537
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,367
That's tough. Look at the
Way you behaved all day.

538
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:04,234
One minute, you're going
To a show with me tonight.

539
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,400
The next, you get yourself
Engaged to him.

540
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,534
And then the minute he goes,
You're like this again.

541
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:12,434
Sure. That's right.

542
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,200
That's me.

543
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:16,868
Yeah.

544
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,267
And I rated you the
Best girl I ever saw.

545
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:22,968
It's rotten to be
Disappointed.

546
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,734
You'll be gone
In the morning.

547
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:27,267
It will soon
Be here.

548
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:29,601
I wish
I got out tonight.

549
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,267
I wish
I'd never landed.

550
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,467
I wish
I never saw you.

551
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,901
What do you think
I wish?

552
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:39,634
Do you think
I like this?

553
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:42,167
What are you
Trying to say now?

554
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:43,634
All my life,
I've waited

555
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:45,167
For this morning
To come

556
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:46,667
Because I thought
It had come.

557
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,467
I thought
It had brought

558
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,801
What I'd longed for
So long.

559
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:52,767
Well, I was wrong.

560
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,300
It was just
A day to you.

561
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,601
All right,
You don't love me.

562
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,334
What of it?

563
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,400
What did you get
Engaged to him for,

564
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,901
If that's the way
You feel?

565
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,901
Because I'm going to
Forget you-

566
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:07,400
Because he's fine-

567
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:10,534
Because I'm going to be a
Farmer's wife and a good one,

568
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,200
And don't kid yourself I'm not.

569
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,667
I'm grateful to you

570
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,701
For making me
Forget dreams,

571
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,334
For giving me peace.

572
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,801
Is that clear, or do you
Want me to blueprint it?

573
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:23,801
What do you want me
To do-say I love you?

574
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:26,667
No! Not in
A million years...

575
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,667
If your heart were
Tearing for me.

576
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:32,334
I'd like to see you
Get me now.

577
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,834
It's over-complete.

578
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:38,167
It was a thrill to see
You come out of the sky.

579
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:39,801
It will be
A greater one

580
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,534
To see you
Disappear in it.

581
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,734
You better
Get up early...

582
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,501
Because
It will be early.

583
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,033
Well...

584
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,033
Give my regards
To Joe.

585
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,033
What will I tell him?

586
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,968
You don't need anybody to talk for you.

587
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:19,467
Give my love
To the wichita team.

588
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:09,801
Well, he got away,
All right.

589
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:11,300
Yeah.

590
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:12,767
When do you go?

591
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:14,300
Right away.

592
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,300
Catch the first
Transport out.

593
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,801
Oh.

594
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:20,300
Then you'll want
Somebody to...

595
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:22,300
Drive you to wichita.

596
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,467
Never mind, pal.
Never mind.

597
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,801
You'll be glad
In the end.

598
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,767
Ann!

599
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,534
Ann!

600
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,367
All right, mother.

601
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,300
I- I forgot my hat!

602
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,834
Jim, you didn't.

603
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:52,300
What?

604
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,767
You didn't forget
Your hat.

605
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,234
What did I forget?

606
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,767
You forgot me.

607
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,267
What are you
Talking about?

608
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,634
You did.
You couldn't go.

609
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,434
You came back.
You couldn't go.

610
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,434
Well, then get in.
Don't ask any questions.

611
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,934
Let's get
Out of here.

612
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,267
Get in? How?

613
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:07,634
Here.

614
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,968
You'll be sorry
For this.

615
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:18,701
All right.

616
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,300
Not a word anywhere.
It's a crash.

617
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:22,801
Who have you
Sent out?

618
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:24,300
Oh, everybody.
Everybody!

619
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,801
He isn't worth it,
Either.

620
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,300
What are you
Talking about?

621
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,300
Oh, I don't know what I'm talking about.

622
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,834
Here he comes.

623
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,100
What is this?

624
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,467
I give up.

625
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,801
You know her?

626
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:40,968
Yes, sir.

627
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,267
Well, who is she?

628
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,801
The girl he left
This morning.

629
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,100
Oh, I give up.

630
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,467
Won't do any good.

631
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:47,901
Send him
Into my office.

632
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:49,701
That may do me
Some good.

633
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,234
That's all, frank.

634
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,267
This is my wife,
Gunner.

635
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:59,267
Oh, I've heard so much
About the gunner.

636
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,234
It's almost as if
I'd seen you before.

637
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,734
Now, wait a minute. I
Can't take any more today.

638
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,234
Just tell me about it
As it happened, will you?

639
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,767
I went back for her. We
Were married in indianapolis,

640
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,434
And now we're
With you again.

641
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:11,601
Married, huh?

642
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:12,901
Yeah. Where's Drake?

643
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:14,434
He's waiting
To congratulate you.

644
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:17,267
Hang on to her for me, will
You? I got to get some dough.

645
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:18,767
Gee, you must be
Surprised.

646
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:21,133
No, no, I'm not surprised.
I wouldn't be surprised

647
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,601
If he got married in indianapolis
And divorced in toledo.

648
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,334
I'm surprised
You didn't.

649
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,901
Now, listen to this.

650
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,400
You start out.

651
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,133
You're off on
A great adventure,

652
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,634
Carrying with you

653
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:35,334
The best we can give
You in work and hope.

654
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,968
You're due here
In 7 hours,

655
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,968
And aviation's supposed
To be advanced 7 years,

656
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:42,467
And what happens?

657
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:46,467
You arrive here 37 hours
Late and with a girl.

658
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:47,934
Now, I ask you!

659
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,934
Ha ha ha! Yeah,
But how she fits it-

660
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,234
You know,
One peach to another.

661
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,267
You're going to test that
Thompson racer on thursday.

662
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:58,767
Tomorrow's tuesday.

663
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,767
That will give you a couple
Of days for a honeymoon.

664
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:04,267
Well, the best of luck
To you. How's that?

665
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,734
Well, how about a couple
Of hundred in advance?

666
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:07,901
All right.

667
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:10,000
Right. I'll see you
A week from thursday.

668
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,033
No, no, no, no, no!
This thursday.

669
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,067
I heard you-
A week from thursday.

670
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,767
I'm sorry. The national air
Races won't wait for a honeymoon!

671
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,267
This thursday!

672
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:19,734
Right-a week
From thursday.

673
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:20,767
Lane!

674
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:21,767
Yeah?

675
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:23,234
Wait a minute.

676
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,267
Yes, sir.

677
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,801
If Jim Lane asks
For any money,

678
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:30,167
Tell him he's no longer on the payroll.

679
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:32,234
Yes, Mr. Drake.

680
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,901
You can still
Change your mind.

681
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:35,467
Who'll you get
In my place?

682
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,634
Benson!

683
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,634
Ha ha! You'll
Change yours.

684
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:41,300
Say, Jim, you've got
The idea in your head

685
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,968
You're the only aviator
In the world, haven't you?

686
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:47,300
No, but you have.
Ha ha ha!

687
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,200
There's
Lane's dough.

688
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:57,734
He's got all
The answers, too.

689
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,200
Tell barney
To study it

690
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,634
And then come in here
And see me.

691
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:05,300
Well, I got it.

692
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,501
How much?

693
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,901
The gate. Yeah, he's
Pulled a lot of beauties,

694
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:11,767
But this one he dressed up for the ball
- I'm fired.

695
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,734
Jim! Jim, fly for me.
Fly mine.

696
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,767
I've got the fastest ship
In the world.

697
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,234
Hello, stuart.
Oh, and get this-

698
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,734
Listen, Jim, I've given 3
Good years designing that ship.

699
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:22,267
If I win the thompson,
I'll have a factory in a year!

700
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:23,767
Hey, grant,
Hey, hey.

701
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,267
You know I'm broke, Jim.
I can't give you any dough,

702
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:28,767
But if you win,
The whole 10 grand is yours!

703
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,267
How can he fire you? We're
Testing the racing job on thursday.

704
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,267
I don't feel like
Testing it thursday.

705
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,267
Listen, Jim-

706
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,801
Hey, look, look,
Will you blow?

707
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:37,901
Come on, gunner. Don't
Be that way. Come see her!

708
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,467
Every day's like this,
So don't worry.

709
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:41,767
Charming.

710
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,267
I saw her
Before she started.

711
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:44,767
And you said
She was fast.

712
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,434
You ok'd all that dope.
Remember, gunner?

713
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:49,434
Yeah, yeah, and I told you
Ought to run her on dope, too.

714
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,968
Remember? She's fast,
And she's crazy.

715
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:55,701
Oh, he's kidding you.
It's a good boat.

716
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,234
No, no.
It's too fast.

717
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,968
You know, I like them slow
And steady. What do you say?

718
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:02,467
I got a wife and $10.
What more do you want?

719
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:03,934
Got me beat
Both ways.

720
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,467
And I know
What I've got.

721
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,868
I thought you were pretty crazy
Without thinking, darling,

722
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,734
But I didn't know
You were that crazy.

723
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,501
Jim! Jim,
If I buy a drink,

724
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:13,300
Will you take
A look at her?

725
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:15,734
No, but if you buy two
Drinks, we'll sit in her.

726
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:17,767
If I buy 3 drinks,
Will you race her?

727
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,234
No!

728
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,067
Glad to have met you.

729
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,267
You mean I'm
As crazy as that?

730
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,767
You're worse, honey.

731
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,767
Gunner, he buys
A ring for 600.

732
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,601
He marries a girl.
He has $10 in the world.

733
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:34,167
He loses his job,
And he comes out laughing.

734
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:35,767
Yeah, it's all
Very funny.

735
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:38,267
We're wasting time. How much
Dough have you really got?

736
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:40,467
I had 200 coming, but
That was this morning.

737
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:41,601
Well, who took it?

738
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:42,634
Indianapolis.

739
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,968
All right, I'll
Cut you in on the 10.

740
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
What will we do first?
We've got to get a house.

741
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:50,801
Don't you live anywhere,
Darling?

742
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,567
No. Gunner and I move around.
We've got our clothes in a room.

743
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:56,400
There's some apartments over on 81st
Street we'd like. Let's grab one.

744
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,067
Don't you have to pay
Anything in advance?

745
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,067
No.

746
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:00,234
How do you know?

747
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,400
I don't know. I just
Know that you don't.

748
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,868
How are you,
Gunner, old boy?

749
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:06,234
Oh, I'm great. I got the
Whole thing figured out.

750
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,567
I'm going to be associated
With two nuts instead of one.

751
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,234
Why, gunner.
Why, gunner.

752
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,567
What are you
Looking at?

753
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:13,934
I found a dime.

754
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:16,767
Ooh, it's nice.

755
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:17,934
We'll take it.

756
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,434
Darling, we've only seen
This room.

757
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,067
We'll look
At the rest of it.

758
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:23,100
I think that would be a very good idea.

759
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,434
The doors work good.

760
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:26,267
What do you think
Of this room, dear?

761
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,434
I think it's fine.

762
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:28,767
I'm glad you do.

763
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,734
Does he always take
Everything like this?

764
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,234
He's inclined to. He's very
Much of a hurry-up gentleman.

765
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,734
They're the very first to
Complain if anything goes wrong.

766
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:37,267
Does philosophy go
With the joint,

767
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,267
Or do we get that
On the side?

768
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,234
Come on, dear. Let's
Look at the kitchen.

769
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,767
Yeah, ok.
Oh. Ok!

770
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:45,767
I think we'd like
To have it very much.

771
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,300
The faucets
Are nice.

772
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:51,000
That will be one month in advance, please
- $150.

773
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,300
Ahem. It's your turn to turn
On the speed, isn't it, pal?

774
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,300
He's a crazy loon,
Isn't he?

775
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:58,801
He's a test pilot.

776
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:01,300
Oh, you try airplanes out before we do.

777
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:04,300
Mm-hmm, and they try
Themselves out before I do.

778
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,767
Can I see the kitchen
Again?

779
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:08,300
Surely. If you notice,
It's a brand-new stove.

780
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,267
I wouldn't miss this
For anything.

781
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:12,133
Look, that was
Just an excuse.

782
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,934
I wanted to speak
To you alone.

783
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,934
Oh.

784
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,601
What do you think
Of that girl?

785
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,467
Why, I should think
She's very nice.

786
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:19,801
We just got married.

787
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:21,167
Oh, did you?
Just today?

788
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:22,334
Just now.

789
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,834
Where were you married,
Mr. Lane?

790
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,100
Indianapolis.

791
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,834
Indi-maybe you think you're
Still in indianapolis.

792
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:29,334
Huh? Oh, no, dear.
I see what you mean.

793
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,167
No, no, we were
Married in indianapolis

794
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:33,501
A couple of hours ago.
Came here in a plane.

795
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,300
Oh, not as crazy
As that, pal, really.

796
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,200
Do I think this is
Indianapolis? Ha ha!

797
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,334
And look, get this.
She never was here.

798
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,100
First time
In new york, see?

799
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,501
Well, now, I got to show
Her around good, haven't I?

800
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,501
It takes a little dough,
Right? You said it.

801
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,467
Does this mean you
Can't pay me in advance?

802
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:49,334
No, no, no. Don't bother
About that, honey.

803
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,734
Look, I want to borrow
A hundred bucks from you.

804
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:53,133
Mr. Lane.

805
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,400
Well, next week I'll
Have plenty of dough.

806
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:57,200
In my business,
You make it that way.

807
00:40:57,267 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm always in the hole from 5 to 10
Grand, and then I pay it back in one sweep.

808
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,334
I don't owe
Anybody yet.

809
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,534
But, Mr. Lane-

810
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, listen.
She likes you.

811
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:06,801
I don't give out the blarney.
You know what I mean by that,

812
00:41:06,868 --> 00:41:08,901
But sometimes
- I want that dough very much.

813
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:11,801
If I didn't like you, I
Wouldn't ask you for a quarter,

814
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:14,801
But it's fun asking you for dough.
I'm enjoying this, aren't you?

815
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:16,501
Well, I don't know.

816
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:19,467
Of course, if it's going to leave you
Short, don't give it another thought.

817
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:21,734
Mr. Lane, I have
Exactly $9.00,

818
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,801
But you may have it
If it will help you any.

819
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:27,834
Darling, I got you
Beat by a buck.

820
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,634
You keep it. Ann!

821
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:31,667
Yes?

822
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:32,868
A lovely woman.

823
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:35,133
Yes, dear, and did you like
The new stove?

824
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,300
Mm-hmm. She was right.
It's a brand-new stove.

825
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,834
Well, the stove isn't the
Only new thing in this kitchen.

826
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:41,334
I understand
You just married him.

827
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,334
You didn't have no chance
Not to, did you?

828
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,834
Not any,
And neither did he.

829
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:49,300
Glad you're going to
Live here...

830
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:50,801
I guess.

831
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:52,467
Ha ha ha!

832
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,267
You've got
A new girl.

833
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:58,167
Yeah. I still got the
10, and that's all.

834
00:41:58,234 --> 00:42:00,701
I got to stick another
Zero on it somehow.

835
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,968
We don't need any more.
I'll try out the new stove.

836
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,400
Gunner!

837
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:12,767
You know, sometime when we might
Be starving to death or something-

838
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:14,300
But the 9 bucks got me.

839
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:17,300
The minute she pulled out the
Old pocketbook, I knew I was sunk.

840
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,300
I should have known better
Than to listen.

841
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,300
Here, here. Stick it
Away and stop beefing.

842
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:22,801
Save it
For a snowstorm.

843
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:25,801
How do you like that? I'll bet
You this 10 against that dime

844
00:42:25,868 --> 00:42:27,133
He's got this
Before morning.

845
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,801
Oh, what a lovely
Way to live!

846
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:31,801
Yeah, and if we ever get
Hungry, we can always cook this.

847
00:42:31,868 --> 00:42:33,267
Oh! Right
On the new stove?

848
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:35,801
Mm-hmm. We got a hundred
Bucks, a new house,

849
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:37,801
And a city. Where do we head first?

850
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:39,300
I'll fix this first.

851
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,767
All right. What do you
Think of it?

852
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,300
This works good.

853
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:44,801
Suits you ok, huh?

854
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:47,801
Sure. I'll come over and
Visit you from time to time.

855
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,133
Oh, yeah?

856
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,300
Now, this is your room,
Or we don't play.

857
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:53,767
Ok, sucker?

858
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:57,267
Say, uh, it's 6:00. The
Stores close at half past.

859
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,767
What stores?

860
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:01,234
Oh, ain't you going to
Buy her anything?

861
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,234
Tomorrow, everything. She
Doesn't need anything tonight.

862
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,767
What's the matter
With you?

863
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,767
She needs a nightgown,
Don't she?

864
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,300
Oh.

865
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,300
She's a lady,
You mug.

866
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:13,300
Yeah. Yeah, I guess she
Does at that, doesn't she?

867
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:15,267
Well,
Be just as well.

868
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:16,801
Yeah, yeah,
You're right.

869
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:19,000
Anything else
You can think of?

870
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:23,501
Oh, darling, it's
Going to be lovely here.

871
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,000
Wait until I've changed it all around.

872
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:29,133
What are you
So serious about?

873
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,767
Say, you've got to buy
Something before we have dinner.

874
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:33,100
Oh, what?

875
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,601
A nightgown.

876
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,601
Ha ha ha!
Why, darling.

877
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,267
What's the matter?

878
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:40,300
I'm so surprised.

879
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,534
Oh. Ha ha!

880
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,501
Will you buy it
For me?

881
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:48,000
Me?

882
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:49,501
Please.

883
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,200
Ha ha ha!

884
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:53,767
Where do you
Find them?

885
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,267
Just ask for
The lingerie department.

886
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,167
That's all
I'm going to tell you.

887
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,434
The lawnja what?

888
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:00,601
The lingerie department.
Why don't you ask him?

889
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:05,734
Uh, where's the, uh-

890
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:08,767
The lawnjer,
Uh, department?

891
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,234
The what, sir?

892
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,734
The lawnjer-

893
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:13,267
Nightgowns!

894
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:14,801
Oh, for yourself,
Sir?

895
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:16,300
No.

896
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:18,968
The ladies' department
On the third floor, sir.

897
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,801
Third floor.

898
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,667
Well, it ain't
My fault.

899
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:28,467
Here we are, darling.
Now, it's my present,

900
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:31,467
So I'm going to make
Believe I'm not with you.

901
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:32,968
Go right ahead.

902
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,634
Go on.

903
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:37,434
That's right.

904
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:38,767
Hey, come on.

905
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:41,634
Go on, go on. Come on,
Let's get out of here.

906
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:43,601
Go on, will you?
All right now.

907
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,300
Hey.

908
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:49,667
How do you do?

909
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:51,334
Uh, a nightgown
For a lady.

910
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,267
Yes, sir. What color
Does she fancy, sir?

911
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:54,701
Color?

912
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:59,534
Hey, what color you think
She likes?

913
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:01,534
You can't go wrong
With pink.

914
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:03,067
No? Let's see
The pinks.

915
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,534
Yes, sir.

916
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,067
She'll think you're
Buying flowers.

917
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:08,767
Here's the very latest
Thing from paris, sir.

918
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,767
This is very pretty
And very reasonable.

919
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,767
How tall is
The young lady?

920
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:15,267
About his size.

921
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:19,267
36, I'd say. You just feel
The texture of that, sir.

922
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:21,801
It feels all right.
Feel it.

923
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:23,801
It feels good.

924
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,467
Yeah, I should say
That's about the right size.

925
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,267
Hey, hey, hey.

926
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:33,300
Yeah, wrap it up.

927
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:34,934
Are you being
Waited on, lady?

928
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Brilliantly.

929
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,501
What's the damage?

930
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,033
$60, please,
Sir.

931
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,300
Well, the "please"
Goes with it, anyway.

932
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,634
Say, this is a good business,
Isn't it?

933
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:45,300
We do very well
Here, sir.

934
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,934
Yes, I see
What you mean.

935
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,467
Well, there it is.

936
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:49,968
Got a good start.

937
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,133
It was your idea.
I hope you're satisfied.

938
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,133
Yeah. I'd like to know
What I get out of it!

939
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,734
Thanks. Rural england, the netherlands,

940
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,567
France, italy,
Sweden-

941
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,801
Sweden!

942
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:04,767
Yeah, sweden's fine, and
Bulgaria and those burgs.

943
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:07,100
Sweden first. You better
Look up the hotels, gunner.

944
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,400
Don't you think we better
Look up a plane

945
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,767
To win the race
Before I hire the rooms?

946
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,267
I'm flying for Drake. He'll
Be looking all over town

947
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:15,901
For me by tomorrow,
And you know it.

948
00:46:15,968 --> 00:46:17,601
Yeah, and you can't
Lose the race.

949
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,767
I might as well switch the
10,000 to swedish dough.

950
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,434
Ann, those babies are
All broke over there.

951
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:24,234
Do you realize how much swedish
Dough you can get for 10 grand?

952
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,734
Darling, I happen to know. They'll
Elect you king of something.

953
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:29,634
They won't let us out of town.
We'll hire a castle on the nile.

954
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:30,934
The nile?
The nile?

955
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,300
Whatever their river is.
They've all got a river.

956
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,634
And so they have, precious.
Darling, I've got to kiss you.

957
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,133
The only thing
That bothers me-

958
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,100
Why do we go to cleveland at
All and waste all that time?

959
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,801
You don't think
I can lose, do you?

960
00:46:41,868 --> 00:46:42,968
The gunner doesn't,
Either.

961
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,100
I don't know.
He lost when he met you.

962
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:46,567
Gunner,
Look what he won.

963
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:49,133
Watch us, baby, and we'll show
You a little swedish massage.

964
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,234
Hey.

965
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,234
What?

966
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,234
Drake.

967
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,234
Where?

968
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,400
Guy with the hair.

969
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:01,601
Oh.

970
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:02,901
How's it going?

971
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:04,267
Hello, Jim.

972
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:06,767
Every day will be
Thursday, by and by.

973
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:13,434
He's going to pay
For that.

974
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,734
What, dear?

975
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,601
Didn't ask me
To come back, did he?

976
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,300
Trying to wait me out. All
Right, I've got another idea.

977
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,234
All right, I got
Nothing more to say.

978
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,234
Yes, I have. I've got one
Thing to say to you, ann.

979
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,467
Yes?

980
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:28,267
Don't let him fly grant's
Ship. It's dangerous.

981
00:47:28,334 --> 00:47:29,601
Is it, honey?

982
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,100
She's got your number. Don't
Pay any attention to him.

983
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:34,133
I've had to listen
To this for years.

984
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,634
"don't do this." "don't do
That." "don't do anything."

985
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,300
Well, I'm going to
Fly grant's ship,

986
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:40,801
And Drake will rue the day
For being so fresh.

987
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:42,968
How do you like that one-
"rue the day"?

988
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:45,834
I'm picking up words. She
Went to school. Here we are.

989
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,234
Oh, can you spare
A dollar, sweets?

990
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,734
Oh, yeah,
Sure, sure.

991
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:56,701
Here, take it all-
All of $3.00.

992
00:47:56,767 --> 00:47:59,567
Oh, no, just a dollar. I
Want to buy a toothbrush.

993
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:01,367
White teeth-
Don't you want them?

994
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,234
$2.20.

995
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,734
$2.20? Ahem.

996
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:07,434
He's got it.

997
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:12,200
Oh, wait a minute! Jim,
Don't forget my package!

998
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:13,400
What package?

999
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:14,434
My nightgown!

1000
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,868
Oh! Hey!

1001
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,267
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1002
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:21,133
We left a package!

1003
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:33,767
Ha ha ha!

1004
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:35,267
Well, see you
Later.

1005
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:36,767
Hey, where are you
Going?

1006
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,767
I'll go over and pick up our clothes

1007
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,133
Before somebody
Pinches them.

1008
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,801
I'll get everything together
And see you in the morning.

1009
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:45,300
Gunner, where do you wish
I were right now-

1010
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:47,300
Back in kansas
Sitting on a fence?

1011
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,801
Why do you
Say that?

1012
00:48:48,868 --> 00:48:50,300
How long has it been

1013
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,267
Since you've said good night
To him outside?

1014
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:53,734
Believe me, it's a relief. Somebody else

1015
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:56,734
Can put him to bed for a change.

1016
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,901
Gunner, help me
Make you like me.

1017
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:00,400
Sure, I do.

1018
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:03,400
Don't wish I were
Back on the fence.

1019
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:05,734
You were so dear
To me.

1020
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:08,234
Gee, was it really
Just this morning?

1021
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,734
Don't expect any day
To be any different.

1022
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:13,734
Just gather thy happiness
While thy mayest.

1023
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:17,267
Must have gone to school
Myself at one time or another.

1024
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:19,434
You big dumb-

1025
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,801
Oh, go to bed.

1026
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,934
Good afternoon,
Ladies and gentlemen.

1027
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,267
Welcome
To the cleveland airport

1028
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:38,234
For the final day
Of the national air races.

1029
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,234
This is the windup of the greatest series
Of events ever seen at any air race,

1030
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,267
And this afternoon the eyes not only
Of those of us here at the field,

1031
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:47,267
But of the whole world will be
Focused on the grand prix of aviation,

1032
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,167
The testing ground
Of both men and planes,

1033
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:51,300
The world's most grueling
Competitive speed race,

1034
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:52,801
The thompson
Trophy race.

1035
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:54,801
There's the army bombardment
Group taking off

1036
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:57,767
For an exhibition of practice
Maneuvers and of dive-bombing.

1037
00:49:57,834 --> 00:50:00,467
The squadron, upon reaching
Their rendezvous...

1038
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:02,734
Ok, Jim, everything is great.
Isn't it, gunner?

1039
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:05,801
Ok, you just go up there, boy.
You cannot lose!

1040
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:08,133
Can he, gunner?
Just go up there, boy.

1041
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,267
You cannot lose.
You got the finest-

1042
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:12,434
Up in the grandstand,
Up in the grandstand.

1043
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:15,801
Yeah, yeah. If you're not here
When I come back, I'll understand.

1044
00:50:15,868 --> 00:50:16,968
Ok, ok.

1045
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:18,467
Yeah, ok, ok.

1046
00:50:18,534 --> 00:50:20,801
Ha ha! Well,
Does she go?

1047
00:50:20,868 --> 00:50:23,334
She goes,
But don't ask me where.

1048
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,334
Well, this is a funny
Situation, isn't it, Jim?

1049
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,834
You miss me?

1050
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,334
Yeah. Is it mutual?

1051
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,834
Well, it doesn't
Seem natural.

1052
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:32,300
I'll give you
That much.

1053
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:33,767
Benson's all right.

1054
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,334
Oh, sure,
Benson's all right.

1055
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,834
He's a little bit
Worried.

1056
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:38,334
Oh?

1057
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,834
Yeah. He says the new ship is so fast

1058
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:43,334
He's afraid the judges won't
Be able to count the laps.

1059
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,334
Ha ha! He spent
The dough already.

1060
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,834
He's taking his family to italy.

1061
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:50,300
How's thursday
Feeling?

1062
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,834
Who?

1063
00:50:51,901 --> 00:50:53,234
Your pretty wife.

1064
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,601
Oh, yeah! Ha ha!

1065
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,133
Hey, where is
Thursday?

1066
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,467
She's in the grandstand.
Where's friday? In the bar.

1067
00:50:58,534 --> 00:50:59,601
No, Jim, no.

1068
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:01,501
Yeah. We just got
Time for one.

1069
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,501
Scotch and a coke.

1070
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:06,701
A coke and a coke.

1071
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:07,868
Hiya, hiya,
Hiya, pal.

1072
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:10,300
Well, hiya, pal. How
Are you? Glad to see you.

1073
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,934
Gunner, do you know
The mighty Benson?

1074
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,300
Oh, yeah-
The parachute jumper.

1075
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,934
You got good seats? Going to be
A nice race to watch.

1076
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,234
The battle for second place
Is going to be vicious.

1077
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,300
My wife's sitting pretty. You can
Buy a lot of seats for 10 grand.

1078
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:23,300
You're a piker.
My wife's here with the kids.

1079
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:25,634
What do you want to
Disappoint all of them for?

1080
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:26,968
I hear you're
Going to italy.

1081
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:28,167
Right from here, Jim.

1082
00:51:28,234 --> 00:51:29,734
We'll meet you
In sweden.

1083
00:51:29,801 --> 00:51:32,167
I'm not kidding. The missis has
Been harping about the mediterranean,

1084
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:35,200
But this is
The first real dough

1085
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:37,133
I've ever got ahold of.
Oh, oh, may!

1086
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,501
You know
Jim Lane.

1087
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:39,834
No. Ha ha!

1088
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:41,334
How do you do,
Mrs. Benson?

1089
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,334
And this is the gunner, his mechanic.

1090
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,534
How do you do?

1091
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,000
The boys are drowning their sorrows.

1092
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:47,467
What will you have,
Mrs. Benson?

1093
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:49,801
I understand we're celebrating
A trip to the mediterranean.

1094
00:51:49,868 --> 00:51:51,334
Oh, nothing,
Thanks.

1095
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,267
Oh. And I wish Fred would stop
Talking about the mediterranean.

1096
00:51:54,334 --> 00:51:55,934
He's got me
Half-believing it,

1097
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,767
And as for the children,
They might as well be there.

1098
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:00,267
Daddy!
Daddy!

1099
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:02,801
Look, daddy, all pictures about italy.

1100
00:52:02,868 --> 00:52:04,300
Have you ever
Been to italy?

1101
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:06,801
Mother says the sea
Is bluer than the sky.

1102
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:08,267
I want a drink!

1103
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,801
Ha ha! You want
A drink!

1104
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:11,300
His father's boy.

1105
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:13,300
Good-bye. I'm awfully glad
To have met you.

1106
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:14,801
Thank you.
Good-bye.

1107
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:17,634
Attention! Pilots
For the thompson trophy race

1108
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,267
On the lines now!

1109
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:22,567
Now, ladies
And gentlemen,

1110
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:24,267
The big event of the year
In aviation-

1111
00:52:24,334 --> 00:52:27,367
The thompson trophy race for
The 10 fastest planes in america.

1112
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:29,033
20 times around
This closed course

1113
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,734
In aviation's toughest
Competitive speed event.

1114
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,234
Why, it's annie.

1115
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,267
Yes! And to think
I left kansas for this.

1116
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:37,234
I wonder what
Joe's doing now.

1117
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,267
Is this giving me
The laugh?

1118
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:42,334
Mm-hmm. There's a sucker
Born every second, pal.

1119
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,968
Not anymore.
I broke the mold.

1120
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:48,501
All clear?

1121
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:49,834
Clear!

1122
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,801
Well, you can
Sing a song

1123
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:55,067
Of 10 grand, a pocketful of dough!

1124
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:56,901
I'll see you
At the bank!

1125
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:00,767
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

1126
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:02,434
I won't!

1127
00:53:04,334 --> 00:53:05,767
Oh, darling!

1128
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:06,767
Yeah!

1129
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:09,300
I got a telegram
From the landlady!

1130
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,300
Oh, yeah?
What did she say?

1131
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:12,801
She hopes you win!

1132
00:53:12,868 --> 00:53:14,868
Here comes
The first entry racer-

1133
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:16,834
Number 7,
Flown by Jim Lane.

1134
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:20,133
Lane, you remember, won the
Thompson last year in a Drake special

1135
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,601
And set a new record
Of 259.108 miles per hour.

1136
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,000
There's the starter
Holding up his flag.

1137
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:28,801
Benny strong will be
Flying his number 86.

1138
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:31,167
The timers and judges
Are ready.

1139
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:34,801
There it goes!
They're away!

1140
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,901
At the conclusion
Of the 16th lap,

1141
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,901
With only 40 miles
Left to go,

1142
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:35,400
Fred Benson
In his Drake special

1143
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:38,334
Is still leading the field
And is averaging 279 miles...

1144
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,467
Now he's pushing
Benson hard!

1145
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:33,801
7 is riding
Right over 12!

1146
00:55:33,868 --> 00:55:35,267
Now he's nosing down
For speed!

1147
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:36,801
Here they come
Down the stretch!

1148
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:38,300
Lane's pulling away
From Benson

1149
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,701
And going into an angled push.
There he goes!

1150
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:44,334
Lane comes over the grandstand
And pulls out into the lead.

1151
00:55:46,868 --> 00:55:48,801
Uh-oh. There's something
Wrong up there.

1152
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:50,133
Lane's on fire!

1153
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,267
The grant mystery special
Is on fire,

1154
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:54,234
With the motor
Of the grant racer burning up!

1155
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,300
Lane has the ship
Under perfect control...

1156
00:55:57,367 --> 00:55:59,501
Come down, Jim.
Come on, don't be a fool.

1157
00:56:05,467 --> 00:56:06,601
Oh, gunner.

1158
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,801
What's-
Why, he's going to continue!

1159
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:11,300
With only 15
More miles to go,

1160
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,434
Lane's going to gamble that
His ship will hold together!

1161
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:14,767
One more lap.

1162
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,100
He's on fire!

1163
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,934
Ah, don't be crazy.
That's nothing.

1164
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,234
It's nice to have
A little fire.

1165
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,267
You don't know how cold
It gets up there.

1166
00:56:23,334 --> 00:56:24,767
Jim! Jim!

1167
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,934
Besides, the guy
Is made of asbestos.

1168
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,467
How can you talk like
That? How dare you!

1169
00:56:29,534 --> 00:56:32,000
Why, you little fool,
Who are you talking to?

1170
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:34,968
What do you think this game is,
Anyway? It's death every time you move.

1171
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:37,033
It ain't safe to sit
In one of them!

1172
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,667
It ain't even safe
To look at one of them!

1173
00:56:39,734 --> 00:56:42,667
And you married him without giving it
A thought. I'll say you're a sucker.

1174
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:46,033
Let me tell you another thing! If you're
With that guy long enough, you'll...

1175
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:58,434
Bless you, gunner.

1176
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:01,567
He's got
A good chance.

1177
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:03,133
It's awful good
Up there.

1178
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,734
There he goes,
Diving into the pylon!

1179
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:07,200
And look! Look!
The fire's out!

1180
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:08,567
He dove the fire out!

1181
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,534
Come on, Jim!
Come on, boy!

1182
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,634
Here he comes-
The winner!

1183
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,400
He's across the line.
Ladies and gentlemen...

1184
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:25,167
Oh!

1185
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:27,534
The grant mystery racer
Wins the thompson trophy race.

1186
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:30,767
Here he comes in now.
Give him a big hand...

1187
00:57:35,868 --> 00:57:37,267
Why, it's a beauty!

1188
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:39,300
What were you doing,
Giving us an exhibition?

1189
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:42,801
Ha ha! Thursday!
Thursday! Sweet thursday!

1190
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:44,300
Aah!

1191
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:45,767
Jim! Jim, that was
Marvelous!

1192
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,300
You made it!
Ha ha!

1193
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:49,234
Hey, hey, hey!

1194
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,901
Oh, Benson's in trouble
- Benson in number 12!

1195
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,334
It looks like he's going to
Crash! Everybody off the field!

1196
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,934
Field guards,
To your stations immediately!

1197
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:15,868
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please stay behind the fence

1198
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:17,100
And off the field.

1199
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:18,601
There's nothing you
Can do there

1200
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:21,000
Save hinder those who are trying
Their best to help Fred Benson.

1201
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:27,701
How is he?

1202
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:29,234
He's all right now.

1203
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,701
Let me through.

1204
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:31,701
I can't.

1205
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:34,200
Please. I'm Mrs. Benson.
It's him.

1206
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:36,100
Will you
Watch the-

1207
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:39,100
Joe, you and kathleen,
You watch the baby.

1208
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:40,601
Now, don't move,
Please.

1209
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:41,801
Mother!

1210
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,968
Mama! Mama!

1211
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:10,634
Wait for me.

1212
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:17,234
She in there?

1213
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,734
Taking him home
On the midnight.

1214
00:59:19,801 --> 00:59:21,234
She alone?

1215
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,767
Children
Are in the hotel.

1216
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:28,000
Well, that's
The way it goes.

1217
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:29,834
Oh, Jim.

1218
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,634
Yeah?

1219
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,167
Benson should never have
Been in that new racer.

1220
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:38,167
There's only one man
In all the country

1221
00:59:38,234 --> 00:59:41,167
Should have been up
With her today, Jim.

1222
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:44,667
After this, let's you and
I stop this quarreling.

1223
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:46,667
Seems kind of silly.

1224
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,701
Yeah.

1225
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:50,868
Go ahead.

1226
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,367
I want to see
Mrs. Benson.

1227
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,901
Yes, sir.

1228
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,033
Oh.

1229
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,534
Congratulations,
Mr. Lane.

1230
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,701
It was very brave.

1231
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:22,901
I don't feel the way
I thought I would.

1232
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:26,834
I guess I was so sure
It would happen sometime.

1233
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:29,000
How's the dough
Situation?

1234
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:32,467
Oh, we'll be all right.

1235
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:35,467
You're lucky in one way, Mrs. Benson.

1236
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:37,000
I mean,
Lucky that I won.

1237
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,000
You see, Benson
And I were splitting

1238
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:40,501
If either of us
Came through,

1239
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,634
But I suppose
He told you.

1240
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:43,567
You what?

1241
01:00:43,634 --> 01:00:46,534
Yeah. Didn't he
Tell you?

1242
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,467
No.

1243
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:50,601
Well, we were,
So I got it cashed.

1244
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:52,167
There's 5 grand
In the envelope.

1245
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:53,167
Mr. Lane, please-

1246
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:54,834
You don't me
To welsh on a guy

1247
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,501
Because he's not here
To collect it, do you?

1248
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:57,534
But I-

1249
01:00:57,601 --> 01:00:59,200
But listen, keep it
Under your hat, see?

1250
01:00:59,267 --> 01:01:01,200
I don't want Drake
To know that I thought

1251
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:03,200
He ever had
A chance to win.

1252
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:05,167
You know how it is.
We don't get on.

1253
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:08,133
Mr. Lane,
You're lying to me.

1254
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,167
If you want
To put it that way-

1255
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:13,033
Of course, it's
So beautiful of you.

1256
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:18,100
I- I do need it
So terribly.

1257
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:21,934
I mean, the children.
I mean, they're so-

1258
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,200
It's all right, pal.

1259
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:29,133
And listen, he died
At his trade, see?

1260
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,667
He has to die
Sometime, hasn't he?

1261
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:35,734
He died in the air, and the
Air is Benson's business.

1262
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:40,133
Yes. Yes, I know.

1263
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,767
And he-he was so dear.

1264
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:48,801
He wanted to take us
All to italy so much.

1265
01:01:48,868 --> 01:01:51,534
I- I hope he's there.

1266
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:55,167
Ohh!

1267
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,501
Oh, god!

1268
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:07,868
If I had
The wings of an angel

1269
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:15,400
O'er these prison walls
I would fly

1270
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:22,701
And fly to the arms
Of my darling

1271
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:30,601
And there
I'd be willing to die

1272
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,634
Come on. Come on. Where is it?

1273
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:34,634
I'm right here, pal.
I'm right here.

1274
01:02:34,701 --> 01:02:36,667
Come on. The dough. The dough.

1275
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:38,601
Never mind the dough.
Waiter!

1276
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:39,834
Listen, ann,
That guy started

1277
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,000
With 10 grand,
All in cash,

1278
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:42,167
And he's
On a bender.

1279
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:43,601
Grab some of it,
Will you?

1280
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:45,601
I can't grab any.
It's too big.

1281
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,033
Attract
His attention.

1282
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,501
Gentlemen,
Your pleasure.

1283
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:49,534
Hi, dear!

1284
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:52,000
What kind of a drink
Is that-"hi, dear"?

1285
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:53,534
Oh, that's
A great drink.

1286
01:02:53,601 --> 01:02:57,534
"hi, dear"
Is a kansas drink.

1287
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:59,000
It originated
In wichita.

1288
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh! Well, then "hi,
Dear" is the best drink.

1289
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,501
Here.
Have a clean one.

1290
01:03:11,534 --> 01:03:13,701
Well, well! Great day,
Mr. Drake. Great day.

1291
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:15,200
The best race by far.

1292
01:03:15,267 --> 01:03:17,200
Not for me it wasn't, Mr. Brown.

1293
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:20,200
There's Lane and the boys.
I'm going to speak to them.

1294
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:22,200
I wouldn't bother. They're pretty drunk.

1295
01:03:22,267 --> 01:03:23,701
Let them alone.

1296
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:26,801
Glad to do it, Mr. Drake.
Glad to do it.

1297
01:03:29,033 --> 01:03:30,934
Boys! Boys! Boys!

1298
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,968
Boys! Boys! Let me
Introduce myself.

1299
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:35,467
We know you!

1300
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:36,968
He's the chamber
Of commerce!

1301
01:03:37,033 --> 01:03:38,467
He's the mayor!

1302
01:03:38,534 --> 01:03:40,467
No, boys, no,
I'm not the mayor,

1303
01:03:40,534 --> 01:03:43,501
But all the champagne
You can drink is on me.

1304
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:45,467
Waiter! Waiter!
Champagne for the boys!

1305
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:48,834
He's
Mr. Cleveland!

1306
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:52,934
No, no, but I know what these
Races mean to this fair city.

1307
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,467
Fair cleveland.

1308
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:00,834
Boys, boys!

1309
01:04:00,901 --> 01:04:03,667
I'm interrupting
This festive gathering

1310
01:04:03,734 --> 01:04:07,501
For two reasons, which
Consists of two toasts.

1311
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:10,367
The first, to Jim Lane,
Who won today,

1312
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:13,000
The greatest race
In aviation history.

1313
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,601
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

1314
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,133
How does it feel to be the star? Gosh!

1315
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,133
I'll pin it
On you, baby.

1316
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,634
The second toast, to the man who
Sacrificed his life in the same race,

1317
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:26,734
Your buddy Fred Benson!

1318
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:31,133
Who's Benson?

1319
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,634
Never heard
Of him.

1320
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:33,934
Get going.

1321
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,267
Come on. Scram!

1322
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,667
Get out of here!
Come on!

1323
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,634
Who is Benson?

1324
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:43,634
Any of you guys
Ever hear of him?

1325
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:46,634
Yeah. Sure, sure. He's
The guy that went to italy.

1326
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:49,667
What license
Did that guy ever have to fly?

1327
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:51,667
He didn't have any.
It's too tough, baby.

1328
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:53,133
The sky looks sweet
And wears

1329
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,167
A pretty blue dress,
Doesn't she? Yeah.

1330
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:56,834
Don't kid yourself.
She lives up there.

1331
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:58,267
She invites you
Up there,

1332
01:04:58,334 --> 01:05:00,000
And when she gets you
Up there,

1333
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,167
She knocks you down.
A nice guy like Benson.

1334
01:05:02,234 --> 01:05:03,767
Don't think, honey.

1335
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:05,801
I'm not thinking, honey.
I'm just telling you.

1336
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,334
Benson wasn't
Good enough for her.

1337
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,334
"come on. Get out of the
Sky. I don't like you."

1338
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,667
Sure. That's her. But
Don't let her fool you

1339
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:14,167
When she looks
Soft and sweet.

1340
01:05:14,234 --> 01:05:16,501
She sits in your lap
And purrs, doesn't she?

1341
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:19,834
Yeah. She don't fool me none,
Because wham! And there it is.

1342
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:21,234
Fire is still fire.

1343
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,667
Stuck her little tongue
Out at me, didn't she?

1344
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:25,834
All fiery red,
A kiss from cinderella.

1345
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:27,968
She didn't get away
With it, did she?

1346
01:05:28,033 --> 01:05:29,934
Did she, kansas?
She got kissed right back.

1347
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,934
Yeah, and when you take her by
The throat, you shake her silly,

1348
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,467
You slap her back, you put her in
Her place, and you give her the left.

1349
01:05:36,534 --> 01:05:37,968
That vicious,
Scheming, rotten-

1350
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:39,100
Darling-

1351
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:41,634
Waiter! Waiter! Waiter!

1352
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:43,133
Hey, what are you doing?

1353
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,133
I'm trying to get
Some of that dough.

1354
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,634
Is that any way to get
It? Gentlemen don't grab.

1355
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:49,634
If you're going to grab,
Grab a waiter.

1356
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:51,133
Waiter! Waiter! Waiter!

1357
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,634
Look, Jim,
You know you-

1358
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:55,334
I'll know you when you
Come back with a bottle.

1359
01:06:00,901 --> 01:06:02,367
Who are you?

1360
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:04,334
A girl.

1361
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,834
Yeah?
Who told you so?

1362
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:08,834
You did.

1363
01:06:08,901 --> 01:06:11,834
I don't even know
Your name.

1364
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,834
I know yours.

1365
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:15,801
I'm a famous guy.

1366
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:17,334
Yeah.

1367
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,300
I want
A blue dress.

1368
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:20,834
Blue?

1369
01:06:20,901 --> 01:06:23,334
She wears a blue dress up there.

1370
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,801
Who does?

1371
01:06:24,868 --> 01:06:27,734
Miss "up there."

1372
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:30,267
I look nice
In blue.

1373
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,801
What do I get
For it?

1374
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:35,300
I'll purr
In your lap.

1375
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,801
You wore
A red dress once.

1376
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,267
I've switched.

1377
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,000
You've what?

1378
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,100
What are you
Doing here anyway?

1379
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,467
What do you want?
Waiter! Waiter!

1380
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:48,300
Gunner, will you
Take me home?

1381
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:49,267
You sick?

1382
01:06:49,334 --> 01:06:50,601
No. I'm just
Tired.

1383
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:51,968
What's the matter?

1384
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:54,467
Come on now, Jim. It's time
For all of us to go home.

1385
01:06:54,534 --> 01:06:56,467
All right. You go right along.
I'll be right along after.

1386
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:57,934
Thanks for the party,
Darling.

1387
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,801
Going to be a lot
Of them, honey.

1388
01:06:59,868 --> 01:07:01,634
Take her along home,
Gunner. She's tired.

1389
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:03,000
Where'll you be?

1390
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:04,300
I'll be right here.

1391
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:05,834
Got any money
For a cab?

1392
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,334
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

1393
01:07:11,734 --> 01:07:13,167
Here. Here.
Take it all.

1394
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:15,834
Thanks. Won't leave you short, will it?

1395
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,467
Well, I met her,
Didn't I?

1396
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:22,000
Who?

1397
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:23,501
My rival.

1398
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:25,501
Sure, sure, you met her.

1399
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,934
Don't just "sure" me
Like that, gunner.

1400
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,434
I tell you,
I met my rival,

1401
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:34,434
And she rides with him
When he's alone up there.

1402
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:36,467
Oh.

1403
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:38,467
Yeah.

1404
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:41,133
And it's hard
To cut out a girl

1405
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,300
A man loves
When he's alone.

1406
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:46,467
He never looked at me the way he looked

1407
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:50,133
When he said he slapped
Her back in her place.

1408
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:54,801
Yeah.

1409
01:07:54,868 --> 01:07:56,968
I met her,
All right.

1410
01:08:09,467 --> 01:08:10,968
Don't worry. I'll stay right with him.

1411
01:08:11,033 --> 01:08:12,167
Gunner?

1412
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:13,334
Hmm?

1413
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,033
Tell him
I want to be slapped.

1414
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:24,200
Back to the same place,
And I ain't sightseeing.

1415
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:30,200
...in your eyes
So blue

1416
01:08:30,267 --> 01:08:36,033
Let me call you
Sweetheart...

1417
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:37,934
Next bar from here.

1418
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:07,467
Don't shake me.
I'm awake.

1419
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,334
I phoned long enough. You should be.

1420
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,167
Yeah. I heard you
The first time.

1421
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:12,701
Why didn't you
Answer it?

1422
01:09:12,767 --> 01:09:15,701
What would I answer it
For? I knew who it was.

1423
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:17,734
Do you know
What day it is?

1424
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:20,701
I know it's day and it
Isn't night. That's enough.

1425
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,901
You know
Where you are?

1426
01:09:22,968 --> 01:09:25,567
I know
I was in detroit.

1427
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:27,667
Yeah. Now you're
In chicago.

1428
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:29,167
Chicago?

1429
01:09:29,234 --> 01:09:31,200
Chicago.

1430
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:35,133
Chicago, chicago

1431
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,634
I don't feel
Like doing that.

1432
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:40,868
You've been in every
City but indianapolis.

1433
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:45,667
Where is she?

1434
01:09:45,734 --> 01:09:48,000
Last time I saw her,
She was in cleveland.

1435
01:09:48,067 --> 01:09:49,734
That was 4 days ago.

1436
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,701
Yeah. You don't have
To worry, though.

1437
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,367
I talked to her
On the phone,

1438
01:09:54,434 --> 01:09:56,033
And I had just
Enough dough left

1439
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,701
To wire her back
To new york.

1440
01:09:57,767 --> 01:09:58,667
Hmm.

1441
01:09:58,734 --> 01:10:00,200
Yeah, and speaking
Of dough,

1442
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:04,167
I suppose you got my share
Right here with you, huh?

1443
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:05,901
Look in my pants.

1444
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:15,534
Even the handkerchief
Is blown.

1445
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,367
In the vest.

1446
01:10:17,434 --> 01:10:19,167
There ain't no vest.

1447
01:10:19,234 --> 01:10:20,868
Where is it?

1448
01:10:20,934 --> 01:10:22,734
Ask the vest!

1449
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,834
Well, pal,
It was a great race.

1450
01:10:28,901 --> 01:10:30,534
I'm glad you won.

1451
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,167
Time to go home,
Isn't it?

1452
01:10:36,234 --> 01:10:38,167
I don't know.
Maybe it is.

1453
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,167
Anyway,
It's an idea.

1454
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,167
Yeah.

1455
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:44,834
And I've got to say
I'm sorry, I suppose.

1456
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:48,467
And yet if there's any
Fuss, I'm going to be sore.

1457
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:50,167
You know how it is.

1458
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:53,334
No, I don't, but let's
Go home and find out.

1459
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,534
And I hope she still likes
You because she's a good girl.

1460
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:59,868
She'd make a fine
Wife for somebody.

1461
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:12,200
We're all right
So far.

1462
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:31,501
Asleep.

1463
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:34,701
That's better than having
Them awake. You ought to know.

1464
01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:42,133
I
- I think I'll go in and see how she is.

1465
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,667
Yeah. I think
That'd be fine.

1466
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:47,167
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll go in.

1467
01:11:47,234 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah. Go right in.

1468
01:11:49,067 --> 01:11:50,801
I'm going.

1469
01:11:50,868 --> 01:11:52,534
Yeah.

1470
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,834
What are you
Going to do?

1471
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,834
Stay here, where
I can get out quick.

1472
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:02,334
Wise guy.

1473
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,367
You're the fella that
Always takes the chances.

1474
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:08,033
You ought to
Know that one.

1475
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,667
You want to come
With me?

1476
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:22,334
No. No, thank you.

1477
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,501
Oh.

1478
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:55,501
Hello.

1479
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:57,367
How are you, ann?

1480
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:02,834
I didn't think
I was asleep.

1481
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:05,834
How are you,
Bad boy?

1482
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:08,334
Pretty bad boy.

1483
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,334
Feeling low?

1484
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,834
I've been up higher.

1485
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:14,567
Sure.

1486
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:21,033
I'm glad
To see you, ann.

1487
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm glad.

1488
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:25,000
Is gunner
Out there?

1489
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,968
Yeah.

1490
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:29,634
I'll be out
In a minute.

1491
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:31,300
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1492
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:33,100
Come on out.

1493
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,634
Nothing to it.

1494
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:38,133
What'd she say?

1495
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,434
Nothing.

1496
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:42,767
Hello.

1497
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:44,367
Howdy.

1498
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:48,501
You're both
Looking fine.

1499
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:51,501
Well, you know, we've been out before.

1500
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:52,968
Experience helps.

1501
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:55,467
Say, what have you
Been doing?

1502
01:13:55,534 --> 01:14:00,000
Gee, that's just like him to
Say that like that, isn't it?

1503
01:14:00,067 --> 01:14:03,000
Well, dear, you've had
More fun than I have.

1504
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:06,000
Well, I've tried, if
You put it that way.

1505
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,000
And I've tried
For 5 days

1506
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:11,334
To think of some way
To be cross with you.

1507
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,734
Oh, Jim, if I could
Only hate you.

1508
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,334
What do you want to hate me for, baby?

1509
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,868
Gee, that would be fine.

1510
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:21,400
And don't sit there
And look so, dear.

1511
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:23,934
He's looking at me
Like he used to,

1512
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,734
Just looking.

1513
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,734
Look at gunner.

1514
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,133
Hey!

1515
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,801
There it is.

1516
01:14:33,868 --> 01:14:37,734
You see what I mean,
Gunner? When he just looks?

1517
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:43,801
That's why I married him,
So it must be some look.

1518
01:14:43,868 --> 01:14:47,167
It's so stern and so sweet
And so dumb.

1519
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:50,334
It's halfway between
An indian and a gazelle,

1520
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,367
And I can't do anything
Against it.

1521
01:14:53,434 --> 01:14:56,801
Oh, won't the landlady
Be glad to see you, too?

1522
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,334
Hmm?

1523
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,834
How she likes you.

1524
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:01,334
She likes me?

1525
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,467
Does she.
She kept asking me,

1526
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:06,667
"when in the world
Will Mr. Lane be home?"

1527
01:15:06,734 --> 01:15:08,167
She's
A fine woman.

1528
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:11,167
Say, how much do we owe her, darling?

1529
01:15:11,234 --> 01:15:12,667
About $200, darling.

1530
01:15:12,734 --> 01:15:15,167
Oh, well, that's nothing, is it?

1531
01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:20,634
No, but I'll bet you haven't got
All of that 10,000 left, have you?

1532
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:23,234
I'll bet-let's see.
5 days...

1533
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,267
Gee whiz,
The way you spend it,

1534
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:28,801
I'll bet you haven't
Got over-

1535
01:15:28,868 --> 01:15:32,100
Over 6,000 or 7,000 left,
Have you?

1536
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,367
Not over that,
Dear.

1537
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:38,701
Well, it's a lot more
Than $10, isn't it?

1538
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,501
Remember the night
We only had $10, darling?

1539
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:43,033
Boy!

1540
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,367
Uh, gunner tells me
You got home all right.

1541
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:48,868
Yes. Here I am.
I'm home.

1542
01:15:48,934 --> 01:15:51,901
Yeah.
That's right.

1543
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:54,400
Kind of a lonesome trip, though...

1544
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,167
Probably.

1545
01:15:58,067 --> 01:15:59,934
Better than
Mrs. Benson's.

1546
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:05,234
Yeah.

1547
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,467
I'm sorry, ann.
I'm broke.

1548
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:14,334
I'm asking for your
Hand. I want to shake it.

1549
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,501
I know you're broke.
I was only teasing.

1550
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:18,501
But I know Mrs. Benson
Isn't broke.

1551
01:16:18,567 --> 01:16:20,501
That was lovely
Of you, pal.

1552
01:16:20,567 --> 01:16:23,868
I'll bet you were funny when
You were giving it to her.

1553
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:26,801
I wish I'd been
Behind the screen.

1554
01:16:26,868 --> 01:16:28,300
Hey!

1555
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:29,300
What?

1556
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:30,834
You're some girl!

1557
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:31,801
Oh!

1558
01:16:31,868 --> 01:16:33,334
I see. I see now.

1559
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,834
You do? What?

1560
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:36,834
I see what you are.
You're all right.

1561
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:38,834
And listen, you know
What I'm going to do?

1562
01:16:38,901 --> 01:16:40,634
I'm going to do something
That'll surprise you.

1563
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:42,834
I'm going to show you
What I think of you.

1564
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:44,834
I'm going out and grab
Some wine and drink to you.

1565
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:46,334
What a surprise!

1566
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,334
Don't kid yourself. Any dame
That accepts things like that

1567
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,300
Isn't a dame.
She's something else.

1568
01:16:50,367 --> 01:16:53,334
Is that joint open on the corner?
Never mind. I'll break in if it isn't.

1569
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,701
I'll be back with the bacon.
I'm drinking to a woman.

1570
01:16:55,767 --> 01:16:58,634
I'm drinking to your mother,
I'm drinking to your father,

1571
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,400
And I'm drinking to the whole
Cornfed state of kansas.

1572
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:07,501
I've been around him
A long time.

1573
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:11,000
That's the first time I ever heard
Him praise anything but himself.

1574
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:12,501
I can't believe it.

1575
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:15,501
But you've got it coming.
It was fine.

1576
01:17:15,567 --> 01:17:20,000
Why? What else do you do
When there's nothing to do?

1577
01:17:20,067 --> 01:17:23,167
It's easy to be gallant
When you're doomed.

1578
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:26,634
What do you mean,
Doomed?

1579
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:29,267
You should
Ask me that.

1580
01:17:29,334 --> 01:17:32,033
Who said I was a sucker
When he was on fire?

1581
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,033
I've had 5 days
To think, haven't I?

1582
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,200
Don't you think I know
He has to get drunk?

1583
01:17:36,267 --> 01:17:38,400
Don't you think I can think with you?

1584
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:41,200
And don't you think, Mr.
Gunner, I've tried to walk out?

1585
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:43,167
I've got a ticket in
My pocketbook, even.

1586
01:17:43,234 --> 01:17:46,868
I've packed my bag so
Many times it's worn out,

1587
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:48,534
But I didn't go,

1588
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:50,734
And now I'm going
To be drunk to.

1589
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:53,634
But, ann, you shouldn't
Think like that,

1590
01:17:53,701 --> 01:17:56,901
Because
- because it's no way to think. It's crazy.

1591
01:17:56,968 --> 01:17:58,367
Well,
This is crazier.

1592
01:17:58,434 --> 01:18:02,300
3 roads face us, and there's
Doom at the end of each.

1593
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:03,767
Suppose
He didn't drink,

1594
01:18:03,834 --> 01:18:05,467
He slapped her
Back again,

1595
01:18:05,534 --> 01:18:08,534
And he sits around, his
Nerves screaming with triumph.

1596
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,033
He sits around

1597
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,167
Drinking sarsaparilla with ann-me.

1598
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:14,033
How he would
Love me.

1599
01:18:15,234 --> 01:18:17,667
The second road
Is worse than that.

1600
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:20,167
He's retired from flying
And works on the ground.

1601
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:22,634
Imagine a man with
His heart in the sky

1602
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:25,200
Living with a woman
On the ground.

1603
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,501
He wouldn't like
Himself very much,

1604
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:30,334
And I wouldn't like him, either, gunner.

1605
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,133
Oh, no. He's in love
With a woman with wings.

1606
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:38,067
She's got him. I've
No way to cut her out.

1607
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:39,434
But there's
Another road.

1608
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:42,234
Yes, there is,
And we're on it.

1609
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,100
We go on as if nothing had happened.

1610
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,767
He goes in the next race, another bat,

1611
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:50,567
Another race,
Another bat,

1612
01:18:50,634 --> 01:18:54,167
Until someday, when he's
Not quite so young and quick,

1613
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:56,200
She slaps him out,

1614
01:18:56,267 --> 01:19:00,133
And Mrs. Benson takes
Another man home on the train.

1615
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:03,634
How do you like it?

1616
01:19:03,701 --> 01:19:05,200
You know, don't you?

1617
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:09,167
No, no, I don't know. I've
Only had it for 10 years,

1618
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:11,868
And you hit it right
On the nose, too.

1619
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:14,234
You just sit
And wait for it.

1620
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:17,133
What do I do it for?

1621
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,467
Because there's nothing
Else to do. He gets you.

1622
01:19:20,534 --> 01:19:23,534
There's no fun being
With anybody else.

1623
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:28,501
What's fun about waiting
For somebody to die?

1624
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:31,167
Every ticktock
Of the clock-

1625
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:33,501
Still living,
Still living,

1626
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:36,167
Still living,
Still living.

1627
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:38,901
What for?
I won't do it.

1628
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:41,701
I won't love him
That much.

1629
01:19:41,767 --> 01:19:43,801
What do you think
I'm made of?

1630
01:19:43,868 --> 01:19:46,000
How can you expect
Me to do that?

1631
01:19:46,067 --> 01:19:47,934
You didn't say
I was a sucker.

1632
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,801
You said I was the champion of them.

1633
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,567
Well, I won't be.

1634
01:19:52,934 --> 01:19:55,868
Haven't I the right
To live my life

1635
01:19:55,934 --> 01:19:57,868
Without being tortured every second?

1636
01:19:57,934 --> 01:19:59,400
Haven't I?

1637
01:19:59,467 --> 01:20:01,234
Haven't I?!

1638
01:20:07,901 --> 01:20:09,701
What's the matter?

1639
01:20:09,767 --> 01:20:12,033
I'm leaving you, that's what
It is, on the next train.

1640
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,534
You'll never
See me again.

1641
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:15,000
Don't blow on me, ann.
Right now.

1642
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:17,634
Give me a chance to make
Up for this, will you? No.

1643
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:20,200
Come on. Give me a chance. I'm
Not used to being married yet.

1644
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:21,234
No.

1645
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,701
But I'll pick up.
I never asked anybody

1646
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:24,234
To do anything
For me before.

1647
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,701
That's a good start,
Isn't it, ann?

1648
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:27,200
I won't do it.

1649
01:20:27,267 --> 01:20:30,167
I've been looking forward to
Seeing you all day. Ask the gunner.

1650
01:20:30,234 --> 01:20:31,667
I don't care.

1651
01:20:31,734 --> 01:20:34,667
And listen, dear, I'm going to
Prove a lot of things to you.

1652
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:36,667
We started on that
Last party together.

1653
01:20:36,734 --> 01:20:38,801
I can see your face
Before me right now,

1654
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:40,801
Sitting there
Through all that smoke.

1655
01:20:40,868 --> 01:20:42,834
We were even flirting,
Weren't we? Sure we were.

1656
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:44,868
That party is going to
End up with you.

1657
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:46,868
You go in the kitchen
And make some sandwiches,

1658
01:20:46,934 --> 01:20:49,667
And we'll make believe there
Were no 5 days in between.

1659
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:51,701
Just you and I
On a little blowoff.

1660
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:53,400
See the idea of it, ann?

1661
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:54,901
Please see.

1662
01:20:54,968 --> 01:20:56,634
No.

1663
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:02,634
Take it easy, pal.

1664
01:21:07,434 --> 01:21:09,901
It's all right. You
Can't blame her, I guess.

1665
01:21:09,968 --> 01:21:11,901
All that talk of sweden
And all that.

1666
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:13,901
You know those things
Are disappointing.

1667
01:21:13,968 --> 01:21:16,400
And she tried hard
To forgive me, didn't she?

1668
01:21:16,467 --> 01:21:18,901
I wish she hadn't made me
Believe it, though.

1669
01:21:18,968 --> 01:21:22,400
She was kind of sweet the
Way she talked at first.

1670
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:23,901
Well, that's all right.

1671
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,901
A lot of angles
To it, boy.

1672
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:27,834
Yeah? There's just
One angle to it, boy-

1673
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:30,868
She doesn't love me as much
As I thought she did.

1674
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:33,234
That's the ticket when
You get right down to it,

1675
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,334
And there's nothing
You can do about that.

1676
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,367
Yeah, and that's
All right, too.

1677
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:38,868
Oh, I don't know.

1678
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:40,868
Yeah? Well,
She fooled me good.

1679
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:43,868
I thought I rated higher
Than a few days drunk.

1680
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,000
I'm sorry I asked her
To stay now,

1681
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:51,000
Because I did ask her. You
Were in the room. You heard me.

1682
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:53,000
I actually asked her
To stay.

1683
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,501
I did something I never
Did before in my life-

1684
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:57,968
I begged a girl
To be my girl. Hmm!

1685
01:21:58,033 --> 01:22:00,801
And I didn't beg her once.
I begged her twice.

1686
01:22:00,868 --> 01:22:03,601
Me! A little country girl
Off of a kansas farm,

1687
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:05,200
And I begged her.

1688
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:08,467
I ought to go in there
And tell her right now!

1689
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:13,400
I'm packed.

1690
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:16,000
See all my things?

1691
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:22,033
You just happened
To come back

1692
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,534
At the wrong
Moment, dear.

1693
01:22:23,601 --> 01:22:26,534
I was telling gunner how
Lonesome I was, that's all.

1694
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:28,000
After this,
I'll understand.

1695
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:31,467
Your life is yours, and the
Loudest applause you'll hear of all

1696
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:33,434
Will be me in the stands.

1697
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:36,834
So, do you still want me
To come to the party?

1698
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:39,367
I'll make a cheese sandwich if you do.

1699
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:41,334
I do that very well.

1700
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:45,234
Gee, I'm glad
To see you, crazy.

1701
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,601
Did you really see my
Face through the smoke?

1702
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:52,601
How's your sky girl? Have you
Slapped her since I've seen you?

1703
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,100
Yes, dear.

1704
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:57,567
I know you don't want me
To get out of here now.

1705
01:22:57,634 --> 01:22:58,968
There's that funny look coming over

1706
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:00,534
Your funny mug
Again.

1707
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,033
See it, gunner?

1708
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,567
I don't see why that's
Funnier than any other.

1709
01:23:05,634 --> 01:23:08,267
See? Gunner thinks
You're funny, too.

1710
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,534
You're a big clown,
Baby.

1711
01:23:11,601 --> 01:23:15,567
No other face ever made me
Laugh so much before.

1712
01:23:15,634 --> 01:23:18,567
And she calls me crazy. I ask you.

1713
01:23:18,634 --> 01:23:21,434
Listen, nuts, I'm going to
Do more than look at you.

1714
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:23,067
I'm going to
Settle down.

1715
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:26,033
Yeah. I'm going to surprise
You. I'm going to settle down.

1716
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,667
How, dear?
Settle how?

1717
01:23:27,734 --> 01:23:29,167
Just the way you want it. Jim.

1718
01:23:29,234 --> 01:23:30,834
I'm going to get
That dough back

1719
01:23:30,901 --> 01:23:32,667
So fast you won't know
What hit you.

1720
01:23:32,734 --> 01:23:34,701
Drake's got jobs that
No one wants any part of,

1721
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:36,367
All the way from pursuit
Jobs to seaplanes.

1722
01:23:36,434 --> 01:23:39,367
That-a boy. That's a cute
Little place to settle down.

1723
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:40,634
What do you
Mean, pal?

1724
01:23:40,701 --> 01:23:42,334
I mean, right in the middle
Of the atlantic ocean.

1725
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,868
Oh. Say, who do you love, kansas?

1726
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:47,334
You, so help me, the whole ocean full.

1727
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,868
I'm so crazy
About you.

1728
01:23:48,934 --> 01:23:50,868
Yes. I'm nuts.
I must be.

1729
01:23:50,934 --> 01:23:52,534
Ha ha ha!

1730
01:23:53,734 --> 01:23:55,100
I wish you could have
Seen Drake's face

1731
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:56,567
When I told him I was settling
Down. He thought I was drunk.

1732
01:23:56,634 --> 01:23:58,100
You're not fooling
Anybody.

1733
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,601
Wrap it tight, pal. I'm going to
Give it the works up there today,

1734
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:02,033
And I don't want it
To pop open.

1735
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,601
I'll wrap them.
You fly them.

1736
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:06,601
What's eating on you? You think
I'm going to get drunk tonight, too?

1737
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:07,601
You think so?

1738
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,601
I didn't say that.

1739
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:10,100
No. You didn't say
Anything.

1740
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:12,100
Listen, I meant every word
I told her last night.

1741
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:13,601
From now on, I'm going to
Attend to business.

1742
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:15,601
I used to take jobs
When I felt like it,

1743
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,934
But from now on, I'm going to
Take anything that comes along,

1744
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,634
And all the dough
- I'm going to put it right in her lap.

1745
01:24:20,701 --> 01:24:22,133
Will that
Please her! Baby!

1746
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,634
Do you really want
To please her?

1747
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:24,634
Just watch me.

1748
01:24:24,701 --> 01:24:26,567
Quit flying and go
Into a shoe store.

1749
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:27,801
Did she tell you that?

1750
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:29,033
I'm just
Saying that.

1751
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,067
Yeah, and you're just
Saying nothing, as usual.

1752
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:33,067
That just shows you
What you know about women.

1753
01:24:33,133 --> 01:24:35,567
A shoe store! I should give up
The trade I love for a woman.

1754
01:24:35,634 --> 01:24:37,434
She'd hate me.
You heard what she said-

1755
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:39,567
She'd be the loudest
Applause of all.

1756
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:41,534
Why don't you go
Drown yourself?

1757
01:24:41,601 --> 01:24:42,939
Is that
Tight enough?

1758
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,067
Yeah, but I'm not
Going to be tonight.

1759
01:24:45,133 --> 01:24:47,067
I'm going to take her
To a show instead.

1760
01:24:47,133 --> 01:24:48,534
And who do you love,
Honey?

1761
01:24:48,601 --> 01:24:50,100
I love you.

1762
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:51,601
Yeah,
And I love you, too.

1763
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,100
Come on.
Cut it out!

1764
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:54,601
Sweetheart,
You didn't kiss me.

1765
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:56,100
Come on. Let's go
And kiss the army.

1766
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:57,367
Yeah. All right.

1767
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,434
Well! He's
Getting even

1768
01:25:07,501 --> 01:25:08,968
To look like
A gentleman,

1769
01:25:09,033 --> 01:25:10,434
Isn't he,
Gunner?

1770
01:25:10,501 --> 01:25:12,467
He's got that settled-down look.

1771
01:25:12,534 --> 01:25:13,934
Do you play
Bridge, Jim?

1772
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,467
It's an idea.
I'll learn.

1773
01:25:15,534 --> 01:25:17,934
Ah, come to the house any evening.

1774
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,934
Glad to.

1775
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,467
Will you come
To dinner?

1776
01:25:20,534 --> 01:25:21,467
Fine.

1777
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:22,968
White tie?

1778
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:24,000
Right.

1779
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:25,667
White tie!

1780
01:25:28,334 --> 01:25:30,667
Ah, general!

1781
01:25:30,734 --> 01:25:33,667
Well, you knew I'd make it somehow, huh?

1782
01:25:33,734 --> 01:25:35,667
Well, I had the idea.

1783
01:25:35,734 --> 01:25:37,667
Well, well, well,
Well, well!

1784
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:39,167
Hello, general.

1785
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,133
I haven't seen you
Since you left the army.

1786
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,133
How are they doing?

1787
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,267
I might forget
A lot of things

1788
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:44,467
If you want
To come back.

1789
01:25:44,534 --> 01:25:45,634
I've still got
Insomnia.

1790
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:46,634
Ha ha ha!

1791
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:48,133
Oh, Lane.
Yeah?

1792
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,133
Drake has probably told
You everything but this-

1793
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,634
This test is more important to
The army than it is to Drake.

1794
01:25:53,701 --> 01:25:57,634
Drake will sell a lot of ships
If you win. That lets him out.

1795
01:25:57,701 --> 01:26:01,167
But the army needs a new pursuit
Speed. We've got to have it.

1796
01:26:01,234 --> 01:26:02,667
Who are you chasing,
General?

1797
01:26:02,734 --> 01:26:04,133
Wait'll you see
What we've got.

1798
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,167
It's a shame to bust up
A pretty bird like this,

1799
01:26:06,234 --> 01:26:07,667
But you've got to
Do it for us.

1800
01:26:07,734 --> 01:26:09,167
We must find out
What that speed is.

1801
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:10,667
She'll move,
General.

1802
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:14,167
I hope so. I saw billy hogan
Bringing the other one down.

1803
01:26:14,234 --> 01:26:15,740
She wasn't loafing,
Either,

1804
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:17,573
But hogan wasn't alive
To tell us.

1805
01:26:17,574 --> 01:26:19,667
I shouldn't be telling
You this, I suppose.

1806
01:26:19,734 --> 01:26:21,701
Why general, you're giving me
The jitters.

1807
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:23,834
What do you expect of
Those army aviators?

1808
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:26,501
Anyway, I'll kiss the
Wings good-bye at 3,000

1809
01:26:26,567 --> 01:26:29,100
And have all the dough
For you, ok, general?

1810
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,634
Come out alive, boy.

1811
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:32,801
Yeah. Sure.
You should see her.

1812
01:27:03,267 --> 01:27:04,367
Thank you.

1813
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:30,234
Thought you were
Going to stay home.

1814
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,100
That's worse.
I'd rather see it, even.

1815
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:35,067
Do they go that high
Always?

1816
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:38,801
That's the idea of it.
They got to get a start.

1817
01:27:40,534 --> 01:27:43,968
How bad is it?
As bad as I gathered?

1818
01:27:44,033 --> 01:27:45,968
Remember,
We don't act.

1819
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,934
I don't know, ann.

1820
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,667
That's right.
Don't kid me.

1821
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:06,267
Here he comes!

1822
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:10,100
I wish he were home. No, I
Don't, either. Come on, Jim!

1823
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:21,734
Wouldn't it be funny
If it rained?

1824
01:29:21,801 --> 01:29:24,701
If it rained now,
We'd all get wet,

1825
01:29:24,767 --> 01:29:27,334
And he's got
An umbrella.

1826
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:44,834
Thanks.

1827
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:46,167
You ok?

1828
01:29:46,234 --> 01:29:48,334
Yes, yes.
Go on home.

1829
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:52,200
You all right, Jim?

1830
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:54,167
Yeah, sure.

1831
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:56,200
Ok, read it
Yourself.

1832
01:29:56,267 --> 01:29:57,701
9.6.

1833
01:29:57,767 --> 01:30:01,033
Yeah. Wait till you see the
Whites of their eyes, gentlemen.

1834
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,701
Ha ha ha!

1835
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,667
Come on. Take
A little more.

1836
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,167
Good. That's fine.

1837
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:08,667
He's all right.

1838
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:10,200
You mean it?

1839
01:30:10,267 --> 01:30:11,367
Yeah, yeah.

1840
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:12,868
Don't tell him.

1841
01:30:12,934 --> 01:30:14,334
I won't, pal.

1842
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,367
Thanks.

1843
01:30:15,434 --> 01:30:16,667
I'll go find him.

1844
01:30:16,734 --> 01:30:18,200
All right, pal.

1845
01:30:21,767 --> 01:30:23,367
Well, well! What are you doing here?

1846
01:30:23,434 --> 01:30:25,067
I was a little
Thirsty, wasn't I?

1847
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:26,734
You should have
Seen her, Mr. Lane.

1848
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,667
He's seen me before. How
About joining me, Mr. Lane?

1849
01:30:28,734 --> 01:30:30,667
Don't tell me you're buying
A drink, Mrs. Lane. Scotch.

1850
01:30:30,734 --> 01:30:32,334
What do you do
For dough?

1851
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,167
Twice. My credit
Is far-reaching.

1852
01:30:34,234 --> 01:30:36,868
Yeah? Then how about
Reaching for that, pal?

1853
01:30:37,901 --> 01:30:38,968
Ooh. $4,000.

1854
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,133
How's that?

1855
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,300
Oh, well.

1856
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,000
Well, look again.
It isn't mine.

1857
01:30:43,067 --> 01:30:44,501
It's made out to me.

1858
01:30:44,567 --> 01:30:46,501
Yeah, and there's a lot more
Coming in that same parade.

1859
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:48,467
Didn't I tell you things
Were going to be different?

1860
01:30:48,534 --> 01:30:50,334
And you know what I'm
Going to do tonight?

1861
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,000
I'm going to take
You to a show,

1862
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:53,634
And then I'm going
Home like a gentleman-

1863
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:55,501
I mean, like a husband. What do I mean?

1864
01:30:55,567 --> 01:30:57,167
The whole idea's
Got me groggy.

1865
01:30:57,234 --> 01:30:59,701
Me, too, but I'm not going to
Be any more groggier about you.

1866
01:30:59,767 --> 01:31:01,534
I don't care
How sweet you are.huh?

1867
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:03,534
I'm stuck on you enough,
And that's enough, see?

1868
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:05,033
Stuck on me, huh?

1869
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,701
Yes, I'm stuck on you. And
Now I'm going to drink to you.

1870
01:31:07,767 --> 01:31:09,667
Here's to your mother,
Here's to your father,

1871
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:13,033
And here's to the best aviator
In the entire cockeyed world.

1872
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,734
Ha ha ha!

1873
01:31:54,234 --> 01:31:57,167
Still living...
Still living... Still living...

1874
01:31:57,234 --> 01:31:59,133
Still living...
Still living.

1875
01:32:16,767 --> 01:32:20,200
I hope you all know
Who you're riding with!

1876
01:32:20,267 --> 01:32:22,701
Woo! Ha ha!

1877
01:32:22,767 --> 01:32:24,834
I'm not kidding!

1878
01:32:26,767 --> 01:32:29,634
I want you to meet
The greatest test pilot

1879
01:32:29,701 --> 01:32:31,934
In the history
Of the world!

1880
01:32:33,534 --> 01:32:35,634
Trouble, brother?
You look mournful.

1881
01:32:35,701 --> 01:32:38,167
Afraid your friends
Will fall out?

1882
01:32:38,234 --> 01:32:40,467
It's another road
At that.

1883
01:32:40,534 --> 01:32:43,000
No, they won't be
That lucky.

1884
01:32:43,067 --> 01:32:45,000
Oh, look
At this one!

1885
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:50,167
Ah!

1886
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,968
Oh, boy!

1887
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:56,634
Yes, ma'am?

1888
01:32:56,701 --> 01:33:00,167
Please don't go so fast. Mr. Lane
Has a little trouble with his heart,

1889
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:03,167
And any speed... Well,
You know what I mean.

1890
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:05,167
Yes, ma'am. I'll take it nice and slow.

1891
01:33:05,234 --> 01:33:06,868
Ha ha ha!

1892
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,901
Oh, it's wonderful
To be silly, I guess.

1893
01:33:14,267 --> 01:33:16,200
Oh, I want
Some peanuts.

1894
01:33:16,267 --> 01:33:17,534
Peanuts? Yeah.

1895
01:33:17,601 --> 01:33:19,367
Oh, be careful,
Darling.

1896
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:20,701
You can't keep
This up.

1897
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:21,834
What's the matter?

1898
01:33:21,901 --> 01:33:23,200
I've never felt
Such pain.

1899
01:33:23,267 --> 01:33:24,701
It's like the sharp edge of a knife.

1900
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:26,200
I'll get used
To it, really.

1901
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:27,634
You'll be dead
Before he is.

1902
01:33:27,701 --> 01:33:28,968
That's
All right, too.

1903
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:30,300
All right.

1904
01:33:30,367 --> 01:33:33,133
I'm sorry. I'll get used
To it in time. Give me time.

1905
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,601
I don't mean that either. I'm grabbing
What I can. What do you want me to do?

1906
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:38,133
I don't know.

1907
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,100
Gunner, don't
Ever fall in love.

1908
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:41,901
Don't ever
Fall in love.

1909
01:33:41,968 --> 01:33:43,634
You know what goes
Good with peanuts?

1910
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,801
What, outside
Of you?

1911
01:33:44,868 --> 01:33:45,801
Champagne.

1912
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:47,334
Yeah? Try
And get it.

1913
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,334
That's easy. There's a good
Hotel right up here-the neptune.

1914
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,501
The neptune?

1915
01:33:50,567 --> 01:33:51,667
The neptune.

1916
01:33:51,734 --> 01:33:53,167
Yes, sir.

1917
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:54,834
Having a good
Time, darling?

1918
01:33:54,901 --> 01:33:56,000
Precious.

1919
01:33:56,067 --> 01:33:57,501
Enjoying yourself,
Gunner?

1920
01:33:57,567 --> 01:33:58,868
Adorable.

1921
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:02,167
Why don't you be gay for once
And give yourself a shock?

1922
01:34:02,234 --> 01:34:03,667
Too many roads.

1923
01:34:03,734 --> 01:34:04,834
What roads?

1924
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:05,801
3 roads.

1925
01:34:05,868 --> 01:34:06,801
Gunner-

1926
01:34:06,868 --> 01:34:08,300
Yeah, 3 roads.

1927
01:34:08,367 --> 01:34:09,834
3 roads.
3 roads.

1928
01:34:09,901 --> 01:34:11,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1929
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:12,467
This is driving
Me crazy.

1930
01:34:12,534 --> 01:34:14,167
The 3 roads? Yeah, the 3 roads,

1931
01:34:14,234 --> 01:34:15,834
And I don't know
What I'm doing.

1932
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,033
You're going
Crazy.

1933
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,534
Yeah, I guess
Maybe I am.

1934
01:34:20,734 --> 01:34:22,067
Gunner.

1935
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:25,667
I'm sorry to see you
Do that, pal.

1936
01:34:25,734 --> 01:34:28,133
You're going to be sorry
For a lot more than that,

1937
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,133
But you got company.
There's 3 of us,

1938
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,133
And we're all doomed.
That's a road apiece.

1939
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,133
And miss up there-
She lives on.

1940
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,100
What are you
Talking about?

1941
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:38,100
You're drunk already.

1942
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:40,601
I haven't said
A word.

1943
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:42,467
Here, have a drink.

1944
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:47,801
Where are we?

1945
01:34:47,868 --> 01:34:49,834
We're going through
Brooklyn, dear.

1946
01:34:51,234 --> 01:34:52,167
Jim.

1947
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:53,133
What?

1948
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,667
Going through
Brooklyn.

1949
01:34:54,734 --> 01:34:56,634
I can't help it.

1950
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:58,667
Brooklyn
Or anything else.

1951
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:00,701
You're helpless.

1952
01:35:01,534 --> 01:35:02,968
3 roads.

1953
01:35:03,033 --> 01:35:04,501
He's on them
Again.

1954
01:35:04,567 --> 01:35:05,667
What, dear?

1955
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:07,167
3 roads.

1956
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:08,667
Oh.

1957
01:35:08,734 --> 01:35:10,334
Make him
Take this.

1958
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,834
I'll take them,

1959
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:14,133
All 3 of them.

1960
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,167
3 blind roads.

1961
01:35:16,234 --> 01:35:18,167
See how they run.

1962
01:35:18,234 --> 01:35:19,634
Where are we?

1963
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:21,167
In brooklyn still?

1964
01:35:21,234 --> 01:35:23,133
You're on
The roads, boy.

1965
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,701
It won't be long.

1966
01:35:24,767 --> 01:35:27,634
Ann.

1967
01:35:27,701 --> 01:35:29,100
Oh, ann.

1968
01:35:29,167 --> 01:35:30,634
I'm right here,
Dear.

1969
01:35:30,701 --> 01:35:32,100
Where's Jim?

1970
01:35:32,167 --> 01:35:33,634
He's right here,
Too.

1971
01:35:33,701 --> 01:35:35,133
Two? You're crazy.

1972
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,968
There's 3.

1973
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:39,634
3 roads...

1974
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:41,501
3 blind roads.

1975
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,801
How much heavier
You figure

1976
01:36:36,868 --> 01:36:38,634
These new bombs are
Going to run, general?

1977
01:36:38,701 --> 01:36:40,133
3 or 4 tons.

1978
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,601
That's enough. Have you met Lane's wife?

1979
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:44,133
No.

1980
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,133
They don't come
Any sweeter.

1981
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,634
Thursday!
Hello!

1982
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:49,100
Oh, hello.

1983
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:51,133
Come over here.

1984
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,634
General ross, this is thursday Lane.

1985
01:36:53,701 --> 01:36:54,801
Hello, thursday.

1986
01:36:54,868 --> 01:36:55,968
Hello, general.

1987
01:36:56,033 --> 01:36:57,434
Get in there.

1988
01:36:57,501 --> 01:36:58,634
Thank you.

1989
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:00,133
Come here.
Well...

1990
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,100
What's the name
Of the hotel, general?

1991
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:04,601
Isn't she a buster?

1992
01:37:04,667 --> 01:37:07,667
This is going to be the
Biggest job Jim's ever done,

1993
01:37:07,734 --> 01:37:09,167
In every way,
Thursday.

1994
01:37:09,234 --> 01:37:11,634
You see all that loading
They're doing?

1995
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,667
That represents the weight
Of the bombs and the crew.

1996
01:37:14,734 --> 01:37:18,634
The height record for a war boat of
That size is just under 20,000 feet.

1997
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:21,634
We're after 30 with
A range of 5,000 miles.

1998
01:37:21,701 --> 01:37:23,167
30,000?

1999
01:37:23,234 --> 01:37:25,667
Ha ha! That's way up, thursday.

2000
01:37:25,734 --> 01:37:27,067
6 miles?

2001
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:28,400
Mm-hmm.

2002
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:29,767
Hi, darling!

2003
01:37:29,834 --> 01:37:32,267
I hear you're going to have
Lunch with a bunch of angels.

2004
01:37:32,334 --> 01:37:33,767
Are you jealous?

2005
01:37:33,834 --> 01:37:35,267
Speak for yourself.

2006
01:37:35,334 --> 01:37:37,067
She's going to have
Lunch with the general.

2007
01:37:37,133 --> 01:37:39,267
Where did you ever find
Anything like this, Lane?

2008
01:37:39,334 --> 01:37:41,601
I picked it off
A cloud, general.

2009
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:44,133
I haven't seen
A cloud for so long.

2010
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,634
Darling, I'd love to take
That high ride with you.

2011
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:51,634
I've never asked you before. Can I
Be a bomb? I'll be twice as quiet.

2012
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:54,434
You know what you'd be
With that dress on up there?

2013
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:55,968
What would I be?

2014
01:37:56,033 --> 01:37:57,434
A little icicle.

2015
01:37:57,501 --> 01:37:58,734
With you?

2016
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:00,467
When do you take off? Right away.

2017
01:38:00,534 --> 01:38:03,501
Give me 28,000, we'll call it a day.

2018
01:38:03,567 --> 01:38:04,501
Right, general?

2019
01:38:04,567 --> 01:38:05,901
Certainly.

2020
01:38:05,968 --> 01:38:07,968
But don't force her, man.
You've got a hotel on your hand.

2021
01:38:08,033 --> 01:38:10,801
What will you give me for everything
I get over 30? I feel in form.

2022
01:38:10,868 --> 01:38:13,667
You just get
30 and stop feeling.

2023
01:38:13,734 --> 01:38:15,934
Those are orders.
Right, general?

2024
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,934
Right.
She'll bust over 30.

2025
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,934
You stop fooling
And come home.

2026
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Yeah. Think of us waiting down here.

2027
01:38:22,067 --> 01:38:23,968
Yes. Think
Of your wife.

2028
01:38:24,033 --> 01:38:27,200
Yeah, yeah. I always think of thursday.

2029
01:38:29,567 --> 01:38:31,501
Come on. Get going. We
Want to get out of here.

2030
01:38:31,567 --> 01:38:33,167
Take your time,
Gunner. We're ready.

2031
01:38:33,234 --> 01:38:34,834
Yeah? You've been
Ready all day.

2032
01:38:34,901 --> 01:38:36,601
Listen, you do
The flying, and-

2033
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,667
Here, here. What's
The matter here?

2034
01:38:40,734 --> 01:38:42,167
Tell that guy-

2035
01:38:42,234 --> 01:38:43,868
I'll tell you.

2036
01:38:45,868 --> 01:38:49,000
What's the matter with you? You're not the
Guy I know anymore-drinking and fighting.

2037
01:38:49,067 --> 01:38:52,033
Yeah, and I'll tell you why, and
You're going to listen and like it.

2038
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,834
Then maybe you'll see...

2039
01:38:55,701 --> 01:38:57,701
What will I see?

2040
01:38:57,767 --> 01:39:00,701
You must be drunk.
I never heard such talk.

2041
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:03,667
Come on. We've got
To go to work.

2042
01:39:03,734 --> 01:39:05,934
Ok. I'm sober now.

2043
01:39:11,767 --> 01:39:13,200
Gunner, I...

2044
01:39:13,267 --> 01:39:15,501
Don't worry, ann.
I'll make up for that.

2045
01:39:15,567 --> 01:39:18,234
I won't let you
Down again.

2046
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,167
Ok, pal?

2047
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:23,167
Ok, pal.

2048
01:39:24,634 --> 01:39:26,834
3 roads.
We'll walk 'em good.

2049
01:39:35,734 --> 01:39:37,300
Ok.

2050
01:40:09,934 --> 01:40:11,868
For a nice fella, you've
Certainly turned into a crab.

2051
01:40:11,934 --> 01:40:13,868
I never saw
Anything like it.

2052
01:40:13,934 --> 01:40:15,367
She lifts nice.

2053
01:40:15,434 --> 01:40:18,367
She'd do better if she didn't
Have so much weight in her.

2054
01:40:18,434 --> 01:40:20,567
You're heavier
Than lead these days.

2055
01:40:34,734 --> 01:40:36,501
Calling w.s.r.
From Lane.

2056
01:40:36,567 --> 01:40:37,634
Yes.

2057
01:40:37,701 --> 01:40:39,634
Lane at 7,000 feet.

2058
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:41,667
Starting up
Through overcast.

2059
01:40:41,734 --> 01:40:43,167
Going on instruments.

2060
01:40:43,234 --> 01:40:44,868
On north bead.

2061
01:40:57,567 --> 01:40:59,033
There she is.

2062
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,501
We're coming, honey!

2063
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:02,033
There's the sky.

2064
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:04,234
Little alice
Blue gown.

2065
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:14,367
W.s.r. From Lane.

2066
01:41:14,434 --> 01:41:16,701
15,100.

2067
01:41:16,767 --> 01:41:19,701
On top first layer.

2068
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:21,701
Switching over
To high blower.

2069
01:41:21,767 --> 01:41:23,667
We'll call you in 20.

2070
01:41:23,734 --> 01:41:25,200
That's right.

2071
01:41:25,267 --> 01:41:27,133
Switching over
To oxygen-

2072
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,334
Hot air to you.

2073
01:41:38,267 --> 01:41:39,501
W.s.r., Lane.

2074
01:41:39,567 --> 01:41:41,167
New record
For weight-

2075
01:41:41,234 --> 01:41:42,801
20,200.

2076
01:41:42,868 --> 01:41:44,667
Full throttle.

2077
01:41:44,734 --> 01:41:48,000
Manifold pressure-
34.5.

2078
01:41:48,067 --> 01:41:50,634
Rate of climb-
600 feet.

2079
01:41:50,701 --> 01:41:53,167
Fuel flow-76.

2080
01:41:53,234 --> 01:41:55,667
R.p.m.-2,200.

2081
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,834
And it's 30 or bust.

2082
01:41:57,901 --> 01:41:59,667
Think nothing of it.

2083
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,701
Yeah. We're at 26.

2084
01:42:13,767 --> 01:42:16,200
Manifold pressure
Dropping.

2085
01:42:16,267 --> 01:42:18,067
We're about washed.

2086
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:22,534
Turn the heat full on.

2087
01:42:22,601 --> 01:42:24,234
It is full on.

2088
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:37,534
29,350.

2089
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:40,167
Get up there,
Baby girl! Get up!

2090
01:42:40,234 --> 01:42:41,634
Can't hear you.

2091
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:44,634
2-9-3-5-0.

2092
01:42:44,701 --> 01:42:48,834
29,350!

2093
01:42:48,901 --> 01:42:50,834
Never mind.

2094
01:42:50,901 --> 01:42:52,667
That washes that.

2095
01:42:59,767 --> 01:43:01,667
We're about through, too.
She's washed.

2096
01:43:01,734 --> 01:43:03,167
Oh, no, she's not.

2097
01:43:03,234 --> 01:43:05,133
She's choking
To death!

2098
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,334
30! 30, I tell you!

2099
01:43:11,767 --> 01:43:14,334
Isn't this high enough?
What more do you want?

2100
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,367
I want 30. I said 30!

2101
01:43:16,434 --> 01:43:19,234
I want 30, and that's
The end of it!

2102
01:43:24,934 --> 01:43:26,634
50 more.

2103
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:28,100
Squeeze!

2104
01:43:28,167 --> 01:43:31,000
Squeeze! Squeeze!

2105
01:43:40,701 --> 01:43:42,133
She's over!

2106
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,601
Yay!
Yay!

2107
01:43:43,667 --> 01:43:45,834
Don't let her
Fall off!

2108
01:43:49,901 --> 01:43:52,367
It's the stabilizer!

2109
01:43:54,667 --> 01:43:57,367
W.s.r. From Lane.
W.s.r. From Lane!

2110
01:44:01,767 --> 01:44:03,667
Let's see you get
A hotel out of a spin.

2111
01:44:03,734 --> 01:44:06,334
Wait till we get down. We'll let in
Some air. Feel all right, don't you?

2112
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,033
Oh, I feel charming.

2113
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:14,334
Why don't we ditch the sand?
She's got to be light.

2114
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,200
Plenty of time, pal.

2115
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:30,234
Uh!

2116
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,067
Go on! Beat it!

2117
01:44:44,467 --> 01:44:46,834
Can you move any? Give me
An inch on that wheel!

2118
01:44:46,901 --> 01:44:49,501
No. Go on! Get out!

2119
01:47:04,701 --> 01:47:06,100
Gunner?

2120
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:07,868
Gunner!

2121
01:47:10,701 --> 01:47:12,634
Jim.

2122
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:14,667
What?

2123
01:47:14,734 --> 01:47:17,133
Are you all right?

2124
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,167
Yeah. Sure.

2125
01:47:20,234 --> 01:47:22,667
Aw, he's tough.

2126
01:47:22,734 --> 01:47:24,734
Hey, can you move any?

2127
01:47:24,801 --> 01:47:28,567
Sure.
I'm just taking it easy.

2128
01:47:28,634 --> 01:47:31,267
Don't do anything
Dumb on me.

2129
01:47:32,667 --> 01:47:34,100
Jim?

2130
01:47:34,167 --> 01:47:36,601
What?

2131
01:47:36,667 --> 01:47:39,133
Just listen.

2132
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,133
I got so many words.

2133
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,167
Let me string 'em.

2134
01:47:44,868 --> 01:47:48,133
Don't take anyone
In my place.

2135
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,834
You're so dumb.

2136
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,701
You don't know
How good I was.

2137
01:47:53,767 --> 01:47:56,868
You just loved me.

2138
01:47:56,934 --> 01:47:59,667
And I was
Awful good, see?

2139
01:48:02,033 --> 01:48:04,234
Give ann a kiss.

2140
01:48:05,534 --> 01:48:06,868
Gunner.

2141
01:48:10,167 --> 01:48:12,868
Here's a break for me,
Though.

2142
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:19,334
I won't ever have to go home
And break the news to her.

2143
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,534
I leave the roads first.

2144
01:48:21,601 --> 01:48:23,167
Don't die...

2145
01:48:23,234 --> 01:48:25,167
For my sake.

2146
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:31,334
That's all
I'd come back for...

2147
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,033
If I could.

2148
01:49:05,601 --> 01:49:08,167
Oh, my dear boy.
I'm sorry.

2149
01:49:08,234 --> 01:49:09,901
Thanks.

2150
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,734
Why wasn't it you?

2151
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:28,934
It couldn't have been
You, could it?

2152
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,334
Oh, no. I've got more
Coming to me.

2153
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,167
I've got to get all
That's coming to me.

2154
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:36,667
Another year maybe,
Another year first.

2155
01:49:36,734 --> 01:49:39,501
I'll go crazy first!

2156
01:49:39,567 --> 01:49:43,167
Why don't you die
And leave me alone?

2157
01:49:51,767 --> 01:49:54,400
Got a kiss
For you, ann.

2158
01:49:56,267 --> 01:49:58,200
His last crack.

2159
01:49:58,267 --> 01:50:00,167
Go on. What else?

2160
01:50:00,234 --> 01:50:02,901
What are you
Going to say?

2161
01:50:04,267 --> 01:50:06,067
Your heart's
Bleeding.

2162
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,767
Aren't you going
To say that?

2163
01:50:10,934 --> 01:50:12,868
My heart isn't
Bleeding a drop.

2164
01:50:12,934 --> 01:50:14,801
My memory of the gunner
Is beautiful.

2165
01:50:14,868 --> 01:50:16,701
I believe you.

2166
01:50:16,767 --> 01:50:18,200
You have no heart.

2167
01:50:18,267 --> 01:50:20,701
You don't know
What pain is.

2168
01:50:20,767 --> 01:50:22,701
But you'll have
Company.

2169
01:50:22,767 --> 01:50:25,734
I love you with
My heart, Jim Lane,

2170
01:50:25,801 --> 01:50:28,167
But it won't last
Much longer.

2171
01:50:28,234 --> 01:50:30,667
Pain is
Eating it away.

2172
01:50:30,734 --> 01:50:33,133
He died at his trade, didn't
He? What more do you want?

2173
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,167
That's great. Go right
Back up in the sky...

2174
01:50:36,234 --> 01:50:38,200
That awful sky!

2175
01:50:39,567 --> 01:50:41,701
Go up there
And stay!

2176
01:50:48,567 --> 01:50:51,200
We have nothing
To talk about, ann.

2177
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:03,200
Howdy.
Hello.

2178
01:51:03,267 --> 01:51:04,868
We had a little
Hard luck.

2179
01:51:04,934 --> 01:51:07,200
I don't know if it was
My fault or not.

2180
01:51:07,267 --> 01:51:08,701
Oh, I guess not.

2181
01:51:08,767 --> 01:51:10,701
You guessed it good.
28,000-cinch.

2182
01:51:10,767 --> 01:51:12,701
29-maybe.
30-good night.

2183
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:14,701
Safe at 28, huh?
That's wonderful.

2184
01:51:14,767 --> 01:51:17,200
Who are you going
To give me now?

2185
01:51:17,267 --> 01:51:19,200
I don't know.
Who do you want?

2186
01:51:19,267 --> 01:51:20,701
Jerry carter's
All right.

2187
01:51:20,767 --> 01:51:22,200
Sure,
He's all right.

2188
01:51:22,267 --> 01:51:24,701
Ok with me. We'll take the
Sister ship up tomorrow.

2189
01:51:24,767 --> 01:51:26,701
Fine. How about a little layoff first?

2190
01:51:26,767 --> 01:51:28,634
I don't want any, see?
I'm a test pilot.

2191
01:51:28,701 --> 01:51:30,634
We live long enough
To build a floor up there

2192
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:33,334
So that someday the world can go to
Bed on it. That's the idea, isn't it?

2193
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,801
You're
A tough man.

2194
01:51:34,868 --> 01:51:37,334
How else do you figure it? And
Listen, I haven't started yet.

2195
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,000
I'll go back up there.

2196
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:41,667
I'm going back up there to pay the
Sky back for what she did to me today.

2197
01:51:41,734 --> 01:51:43,667
I'll pay her back.
I'll wring her neck!

2198
01:51:43,734 --> 01:51:45,667
And I'll show ann something she
Won't forget in a hurry either!

2199
01:51:45,734 --> 01:51:47,667
I'll show her! I'll go back
Up there, and I'll stay there!

2200
01:51:47,734 --> 01:51:49,634
I'll never come down!
I'll...

2201
01:51:49,701 --> 01:51:51,667
What-what am I
Talking about?

2202
01:51:51,734 --> 01:51:55,167
I can't talk-what did you
Let me talk like this for?

2203
01:51:55,234 --> 01:51:57,367
What's the matter
With me?

2204
01:51:59,734 --> 01:52:01,367
You went home,
Didn't you?

2205
01:52:01,434 --> 01:52:03,334
I don't know. I don't
Know what came off.

2206
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,300
She's going screwy,
I guess. I don't know.

2207
01:52:05,367 --> 01:52:07,167
Maybe she's
In love with you.

2208
01:52:07,234 --> 01:52:10,734
Hmm. You should have been there.
It sounded more like she hated me.

2209
01:52:10,801 --> 01:52:15,701
If she doesn't love you, she's got
A mighty funny way of showing it.

2210
01:52:15,767 --> 01:52:19,701
You should have been with us
This morning after you went up.

2211
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:22,200
When the general
Asked her for lunch,

2212
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:25,234
She said until you
Came down, she was dead.

2213
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:31,634
Did she say that?

2214
01:52:31,701 --> 01:52:34,334
Yes, sir. That's
Just what she said.

2215
01:52:35,968 --> 01:52:39,167
She's a nice girl. I always
Thought I got on with her all right.

2216
01:52:39,234 --> 01:52:42,667
I can see how another guy would
Hang around the house with her

2217
01:52:42,734 --> 01:52:46,167
And have a couple of babies and all
That applesauce, but that's not for me.

2218
01:52:46,234 --> 01:52:48,667
You know I'm right.
You know me.

2219
01:52:48,734 --> 01:52:50,667
Oh, sure, Jim.
I know.

2220
01:52:50,734 --> 01:52:53,667
It was in this very
Office I bawled you out

2221
01:52:53,734 --> 01:52:57,133
Because you brought a girl to
New york instead of a record.

2222
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:59,000
You remember that,
Don't you?

2223
01:52:59,067 --> 01:53:00,167
Yeah, sure.

2224
01:53:00,234 --> 01:53:02,000
Remember what
You called her?

2225
01:53:02,067 --> 01:53:03,834
You called her
Another peach.

2226
01:53:03,901 --> 01:53:05,167
Yeah?

2227
01:53:05,234 --> 01:53:09,133
Yeah, and while she never
Got much of a start with me,

2228
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,901
I have to admit
She's just that.

2229
01:53:11,968 --> 01:53:16,200
She's a nice girl, but we
Got no business being married.

2230
01:53:16,267 --> 01:53:19,200
You can say this
Much for it anyway-

2231
01:53:19,267 --> 01:53:22,501
It comes in handy
Tonight because...

2232
01:53:22,567 --> 01:53:24,167
Well, Jim...

2233
01:53:24,234 --> 01:53:27,767
I think if that oil
Hadn't spouted over kansas

2234
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:30,100
And she was
In kansas tonight

2235
01:53:30,167 --> 01:53:32,634
Instead of
In your home here,

2236
01:53:32,701 --> 01:53:34,634
It would be
Pretty tough.

2237
01:53:34,701 --> 01:53:36,334
Wouldn't it?

2238
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:40,133
Ah... Yeah.
I'll give her that.

2239
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,601
I kind of wish
She knew that.

2240
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:45,367
I think it
Would please her.

2241
01:53:46,734 --> 01:53:48,834
Do you think she'd
Like to hear that?

2242
01:53:48,901 --> 01:53:50,834
You know how it is.

2243
01:53:50,901 --> 01:53:53,167
You know how women take
Those little things.

2244
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:55,734
Always seems to please them
For some reason or other.

2245
01:53:57,734 --> 01:53:59,133
It does, huh?

2246
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,667
Yes.

2247
01:54:00,734 --> 01:54:02,133
Yeah?

2248
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,167
Oh, yes.

2249
01:54:04,234 --> 01:54:06,200
Well, then...

2250
01:54:07,934 --> 01:54:10,634
Do you really think it would please
Her if I went home and told her that?

2251
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:13,868
I think it would
Make her very happy.

2252
01:54:16,234 --> 01:54:19,701
Well... I don't mind
Doing that,

2253
01:54:19,767 --> 01:54:21,367
If you say so.

2254
01:54:21,434 --> 01:54:23,000
I'd say so, Jim.

2255
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,601
All right.

2256
01:54:27,667 --> 01:54:29,601
I guess I will.

2257
01:54:29,667 --> 01:54:31,400
Thanks for the advice.

2258
01:54:31,467 --> 01:54:33,334
That's
All right, Jim.

2259
01:54:49,067 --> 01:54:52,601
Thursday, this is Drake.
Say, listen, thursday,

2260
01:54:52,667 --> 01:54:55,701
Uh... I've just been
Talking to Jim.

2261
01:54:55,767 --> 01:54:58,167
Where is he?
Is he all right?

2262
01:54:58,234 --> 01:54:59,634
I said
Terrible things.

2263
01:54:59,701 --> 01:55:03,167
I know all about it. There's
Nothing to worry about at all.

2264
01:55:03,234 --> 01:55:05,267
He's on his way home.

2265
01:55:05,334 --> 01:55:10,234
Just listen, thursday, and I'm going to
Tell you something you're going to like.

2266
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:12,501
He's all through
Test piloting.

2267
01:55:12,567 --> 01:55:15,000
He's in love
With you, thursday.

2268
01:55:15,067 --> 01:55:16,501
Oh.

2269
01:55:16,567 --> 01:55:17,968
Yes, "oh."

2270
01:55:18,033 --> 01:55:21,367
He doesn't know this
Himself, but I'm telling you,

2271
01:55:21,434 --> 01:55:24,167
He'd rather be with you
Than in the sky,

2272
01:55:24,234 --> 01:55:27,601
And when a man's heart's down
Here, he's no more good up there.

2273
01:55:27,667 --> 01:55:29,100
Oh.

2274
01:55:29,167 --> 01:55:31,601
Don't ever let him know
Anything about it,

2275
01:55:31,667 --> 01:55:35,634
And pretty soon Mr. Jim Lane
Will be working on the ground,

2276
01:55:35,701 --> 01:55:38,567
And he'll never know
How he got there.

2277
01:55:38,634 --> 01:55:40,601
Oh, Mr. Drake,
Are you sure?

2278
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:43,601
I've only made one mistake
In my life, thursday,

2279
01:55:43,667 --> 01:55:47,601
And that's the first time
I saw you from a distance.

2280
01:55:47,667 --> 01:55:49,100
Good-bye, thursday.

2281
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:52,467
You're going to hear a lot
Of squawking from him,

2282
01:55:52,534 --> 01:55:54,968
But don't let that
Bother you.

2283
01:55:55,033 --> 01:55:58,634
Just smile up your sleeve
And let him squawk.

2284
01:55:58,701 --> 01:56:01,701
I won't mind
The squawking.

2285
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,868
I'll just...

2286
01:56:06,234 --> 01:56:07,868
What's that,
Thursday?

2287
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:15,868
I said, I hope he squawks
And squawks and squawks.

2288
01:56:18,567 --> 01:56:20,167
I've been talking for
30 minutes to you boys,

2289
01:56:20,234 --> 01:56:22,167
And you're probably looking
Wise and giving me the bird.

2290
01:56:22,234 --> 01:56:24,667
I don't know what I'm doing here
Talking to you in the first place.

2291
01:56:24,734 --> 01:56:27,467
I got out of the army once,
And I don't know how I got back.

2292
01:56:27,534 --> 01:56:30,968
And I'm not flying. I'm talking,
If you can beat that one.

2293
01:56:31,033 --> 01:56:32,534
Anybody got
Any questions?

2294
01:56:32,601 --> 01:56:36,133
All right. Uh...
Good luck and...

2295
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:39,767
And, uh... Well,
Go on and get in.

2296
01:57:39,367 --> 01:57:41,601
What's the idea? What are
You doing over here anyway?

2297
01:57:41,667 --> 01:57:43,634
You weren't here when I
Was handing out the baloney.

2298
01:57:43,701 --> 01:57:45,300
Yes, dear,
We were here.

2299
01:57:45,367 --> 01:57:46,467
We?

2300
01:57:46,534 --> 01:57:48,968
Hello, pal. How are you?
I didn't see you.

2301
01:57:49,033 --> 01:57:52,467
Haven't I told you not to bring
The kid around a place like this?

2302
01:57:52,534 --> 01:57:55,133
Do you know how many
Engines there are over there?

2303
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:58,367
Don't you realize that his ears
Are delicate? Might hurt him.

2304
01:58:00,467 --> 01:58:02,434
What's the matter with
Those guys, anyway?

2305
01:58:02,501 --> 01:58:04,901
Come on, barney. Get up
There. What's eating you?

2306
01:58:08,133 --> 01:58:09,901
I bet you
They don't make it.

2307
01:58:09,968 --> 01:58:11,934
I don't know why I'm not
Up there in front of them.

2308
01:58:12,033 --> 01:58:14,133
A man spends his whole
Life getting somewhere,

2309
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,167
And where
Does he end up?

2310
01:58:16,234 --> 01:58:18,033
Nowhere, just where
He started.
