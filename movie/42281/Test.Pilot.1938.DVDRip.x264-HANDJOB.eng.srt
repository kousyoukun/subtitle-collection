1
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,861
There she is,
Mr. Drake.

2
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:31,393
You mean to tell me there's not
Even that much more to do to her?

3
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:33,425
Not a whisper.

4
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:38,124
All the years and all the
Wrecks and all the schemes,

5
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,891
And out of it grows
This sweet peach.

6
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,089
Yeah, and she's going to
Crack that record by an hour.

7
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,289
You can go and hang it
On your wall right now.

8
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,755
And up high,
Gunner-

9
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:50,255
Up where the storms
Can't touch her-

10
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:53,888
Out of their reach.

11
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:56,853
Something more than
A record, eh, gunner?

12
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,520
She'll spit on
Those mountains.

13
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,352
Yes, she will.

14
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:03,518
If she wasn't such
A lady, she would.

15
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,985
How's Lane feeling?

16
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,550
He's been asleep
About 3 hours.

17
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,049
Uh-huh. 12:00. He's got
To take off at 1:00 sharp.

18
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,048
Yeah. I'll wake him
In about a half-hour.

19
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:13,315
Oh, yeah. Let him
Have all he can.

20
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:14,281
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,815
Lane
Still asleep?

22
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:17,081
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,380
We won't pay him the 750
Without his cross on this.

24
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,881
And you won't pay him if
You don't break the record.

25
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,713
Sure. The ad's no good if
He don't break the record.

26
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:23,012
We're selling gasoline.

27
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,112
Get out. Give me air,
Will you?

28
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:25,378
Air? Is that what you're
Asking for, gunner?

29
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:26,879
Have a little on me.

30
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,345
Everything grounded
West of albuquerque.

31
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:30,010
Just what you've
Been waiting for.

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,878
And look what's waiting
For him over colorado.

33
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,543
It's all right.
He won't be there long.

34
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:34,543
Let me know the minute
He wakes up, will you?

35
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:35,676
All right.
He'll be here.

36
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:36,709
He ain't going
Anywhere else.

37
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:37,876
I wouldn't
Put it past him.

38
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,776
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,637
Hey! Where's Lane?

40
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,503
Yeah, where? I had a
Date with him at 10:00.

41
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,002
You're telling me
Where.

42
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:01,970
When'd you see him?

43
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,335
I'm telling you,
I haven't seen him!

44
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,335
How long you been here? Since 9:00.

45
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,802
When'd you
Fall asleep?

46
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,501
I don't know. What
Difference does it make?

47
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,667
Don't get so tough about it. I'll
Tell you what difference it makes.

48
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,999
He left for home here 3 hours ago.
I want to know if he's been here.

49
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,533
What time is it?
12:00.

50
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:14,998
I was awake at 11:00, I know that.

51
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,165
Then he hasn't
Been here.

52
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,632
Who are you? The guy
Called gunner?

53
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:19,631
Yeah, and I'm telling you, you
Can't let him out of your sight.

54
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:21,164
What are you
Telling me for?

55
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:22,996
I ain't ever seen
So much of him.

56
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,497
You don't think
Anything happened to him?

57
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,662
An accident
Or something?

58
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:26,796
Quiet!

59
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:29,195
Yeah, an accident-
Another dame.

60
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,361
Oh, yeah. Hello,
Gunner, old boy.

61
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,360
Look what I rescued.
Dying of thirst, she said.

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,827
Hello, pal. Everything
All right with you?

63
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:36,826
What's your name?

64
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,025
Sarah.

65
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:39,693
Oh? Her name is mable.
Mable, this is sarah.

66
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,492
And this is the gunner. And this
Is all a very unexpected pleasure,

67
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,191
And I'm very glad
To know all of you.

68
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,557
Do you know
What time it is?

69
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,023
Yeah. Time to go to bed. You
Told me that two hours ago.

70
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,556
What do you want to keep
Repeating yourself for?

71
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,022
Come on, girls. Blow.
Get out of here.

72
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,623
I won't go out
With that.

73
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:52,956
Girls, girls.

74
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,822
Look, this guy's
Got to get some sleep.

75
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,654
Get out of here
Before I throw you out.

76
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:59,620
Come on. Remember, you girls
Were with me if anybody asks.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,986
Girls are
Always quarreling.

78
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:05,285
Girls don't get on good for some reason.

79
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,284
Girls, girls.

80
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,450
The dear old girls.

81
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,616
Jim.
Yeah?

82
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:19,982
Ok. Where are
My clothes? Oh.

83
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:24,948
I don't know
How you do it.

84
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:26,146
How'd she wind?

85
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:27,680
2,762.

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,978
Good. She ought to bust in my face
Before I get her off the ground.

87
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,978
Yeah. Just like
Those dames of yours.

88
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,144
What dames?

89
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:35,144
Oh, lord.

90
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:36,444
How's the weather?

91
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:39,210
You got a 62-mile tailwind
At 20,000 feet.

92
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,276
How's the weather?

93
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:43,275
You got a 78-mile tailwind
At 25,000 feet.

94
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:47,074
Yeah? How's that storm over
Colorado? Who you trying to kid?

95
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:51,173
Ah, what's a little weather
To the Drake bullet?

96
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:54,139
Oh, Drake's got a new
Name for her now.

97
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,806
Calls her
His sweet peach.

98
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:58,305
Yeah? Don't tell
Colorado that.

99
00:05:58,505 --> 00:05:59,970
Don't you worry.
She'll hold.

100
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,304
Yeah. I love you guys
That know all about it.

101
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,303
Sure. If you crack up,
You can blame me.

102
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:05,803
Mm-hmm. I get that
Out of it.

103
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,769
Every time I see a crash
Coming, I know it isn't my fault.

104
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:09,968
That makes it
All right, too.

105
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,467
Sure, sure.

106
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,266
Thank you.
Thank you.

107
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,133
Well, once
Again, Jim.

108
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,299
Yep.

109
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,299
She's in shape.
Like a peach?

110
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,798
That's right.
That's right.

111
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,298
She may leave a little
Fuzz along the way,

112
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,797
But she'll keep that
Schoolgirl complexion.

113
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:29,995
This is more than
Just a record, Jim.

114
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:31,763
It means a whole lot
To aviation.

115
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:34,462
I never heard of it.
I'm doing it for you, pal.

116
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,495
Well, see you tomorrow. All right.

117
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:37,827
In you go.

118
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,826
Go on and break
The record!

119
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:51,157
Take it easy now. Remember, you got
4,200 pounds of gas in this crate.

120
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,156
Yeah. I'd have never
Thought of that.

121
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,924
If I don't see you again,
It'll be too soon.

122
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,756
Yeah, and if I never see
That ugly map of yours again,

123
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:00,421
It'll be too soon.

124
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,974
Do I look like you?

125
00:07:51,174 --> 00:07:52,475
Huh?

126
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:55,707
Well, they're both good.
I'll say that for them.

127
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:59,206
What are you going to do
For the next 5 or 6 hours?

128
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,071
Look like
You're looking.

129
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,705
Well, come on.
Let's look together.

130
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,726
Are you all right?

131
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,592
Are you all right?

132
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,890
I'm licked, see? I'm licked! I
Couldn't move this thing with a derrick.

133
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,357
Oh. That's too bad.

134
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:05,089
"that's too bad."
Is it really?

135
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,256
All I had was a coast to coast
Record, and it's too bad.

136
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:09,689
Don't you understand?
I had it licked to death.

137
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:12,539
Why, I had it right in my
Hand, just like that wrench.

138
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,420
And now you haven't
Even got the wrench.

139
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,253
Say, where are we?

140
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:19,720
We are in kansas.

141
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,161
That's great.
How near wichita?

142
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:23,219
About 20 miles.

143
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,752
I'll tell you what you can do
For me. Do you live around here?

144
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:25,718
Right there.

145
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,418
You got a phone?
Yes.

146
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:29,016
All right. Go call the union
Air terminal at burbank.

147
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:32,082
Ask for gunner morris. When you get
Him, just yell down, and I'll come.

148
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:33,116
Johnny morris?

149
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,483
Gunner! Gunner.

150
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:36,715
Just ask for gunner. Tell
Him I'm calling. I'm Jim Lane.

151
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:38,081
That's all
You have to do.

152
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,614
Why don't you
Call him yourself?

153
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,114
Hey, I got to get
These lines out of here.

154
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,279
You don't think I want to be stuck
In this dump all night, do you?

155
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,879
I don't care very much
One way or the other.

156
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,112
All right, all right!
I'll pay for it.

157
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:50,078
Don't worry about that.

158
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,444
Listen, swellhead, you're
On private property,

159
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,043
And very uninvited.

160
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,377
How'd you like to get
That junk over the fence

161
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:59,876
Before I sic
A bull on you?

162
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,074
Say, I'm just in the mood
For a bull, sister.

163
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:07,574
You go get him. I'm liable to pick him
Up and throw him right back in your lap.

164
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,773
I know you.
You're the prince-

165
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:15,105
A nice,
Charming prince,

166
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,903
Right out of
The sky-

167
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,270
A young girl's
Dream.

168
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,936
And I've been waiting
For you all my life.

169
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:26,268
That's why no other man ever
Touched the tip of my finger.

170
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,534
I have lived
For a prince.

171
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:35,266
What's the matter?
Too much for you?

172
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,599
You're a funny-looking gazabo.

173
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,598
Yeah.

174
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:45,097
Are you a famous
Flier, Mr. Lane?

175
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,730
Why, I'm Jim Lane.

176
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,696
Should I faint
On that one?

177
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:54,061
Say, where
Do you live?

178
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,761
I still live there. I haven't
Moved since I told you.

179
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,892
Can I use your phone?

180
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,692
It's all right with me if
It's all right with the phone.

181
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:07,591
What's your name?

182
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,490
Ann barton.

183
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,690
And we're near wichita, are we, ann?

184
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,522
And it's still
20 miles.

185
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:16,189
That's right. You told me
That before, too, didn't you?

186
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,521
What time is it?

187
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:18,722
About 6:00.

188
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,721
Didn't ask you that
Before, did I?

189
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:23,053
No. Don't
Startle me so.

190
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,052
Do all the girls around
Here look like you

191
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,386
This early
In the morning?

192
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,719
Every girl I've ever seen this ear-

193
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,518
Yeah. Look at
All the hay.

194
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,050
That's wheat.

195
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,718
Oh.

196
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,350
The staff of life.

197
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,383
Is it?

198
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,749
It's nice here
At that, isn't it?

199
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,982
I'm so glad
You like it.

200
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:45,715
How many waffles
Can you eat, Mr. Lane?

201
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:46,748
How many
Have you got?

202
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:48,046
That's all
I want to know.

203
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,046
Come along.
Keep following me.

204
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:55,178
Hey, where did you get such
A nice father and mother?

205
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:57,178
I took time
Picking them out.

206
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,310
Oh.

207
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,509
Say, this is a pretty
Room. This your room?

208
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,975
No. This is
The spare room.

209
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:06,809
Oh. This is where I'd
Stay if I were a guest.

210
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,974
That's right...

211
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:10,840
If you were
Stuck here.

212
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,140
Hmm.

213
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:15,839
Oh.

214
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,839
What's the matter?

215
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,505
No towels.
I'm stuck.

216
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:19,706
Oh, dear.

217
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:21,904
You're not supposed
To say "oh, dear."

218
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:23,837
You should say,
"that's all right."

219
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:27,370
I've been around here too long
Now not to say what I mean.

220
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,536
Quite an imagination
For an aviator.

221
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,201
Can't match yours, pal.
You went to school.

222
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,867
I didn't
Learn it there.

223
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,367
Don't get lost.

224
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,667
No, no. I won't.

225
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:06,726
Ann keeps all those
Records in the books.

226
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:08,159
Ann went to school.

227
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,158
Smart. Ann graduated from the
State university, Mr. Lane,

228
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:11,491
With the highest
Honors.

229
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,491
Didn't you, ann?

230
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:13,956
Oh, you bet.

231
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,657
I broke all records.

232
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:16,956
Did you go
To college, Mr. Lane?

233
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:17,989
Ha ha ha!

234
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:19,656
Why, ann!
Why, mother!

235
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:21,189
She's crazy. I broke
All records, too.

236
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,322
I entered high school a
Sophomore and came out a freshman.

237
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,354
Have you been a test pilot ever since?

238
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,354
No. I was in the army for a
While, but we didn't agree.

239
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:28,621
Had to get up
Too early?

240
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:30,286
No. Had to
Go to bed.

241
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,619
That must be
Your call.

242
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,352
Yeah, thanks. No wisecracks
Now. I beat you to it.

243
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,184
He's
A charming man.

244
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:39,184
Uh-huh.

245
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:42,183
Yeah. Yeah?

246
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:44,015
Yeah.

247
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:50,515
The oil pump let go. He's
Down ok on a farm near wichita.

248
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:54,547
Well, that's
The way it goes.

249
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:55,912
Yeah.

250
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,478
And bring along a whole new
Assembly and the center line.

251
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,645
Yeah. Wait.
I'll find out.

252
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:02,678
Oh, ann?

253
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,210
Who's ann?

254
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,711
Yes?

255
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,310
Will anyone in wichita with a cab
Know how to get here all right?

256
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,642
Oh, sure. Due west of wichita
On the main highway.

257
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,808
Everybody knows
The barton farm.

258
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,274
Oh, sure. Due west of
Wichita on the main highway.

259
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,073
Everybody knows
The barton farm.

260
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,674
What's all this
"ann" stuff?

261
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:22,639
Listen, have you got all
That dope now, or haven't you?

262
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,639
What time will you
Get in wichita?

263
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,638
I'll hop the first trip east.
The weather's cleared.

264
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:28,471
Wichita? Wait a minute.

265
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,337
5:30 your time.

266
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,902
Why do you always have to
Land way out in the sticks?

267
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,868
Hey, this isn't
The sticks, lad.

268
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,168
This is the prettiest farm I ever saw.

269
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,301
Wait'll you see it. The
Wheat sways in the field

270
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,501
Like a silken sea.

271
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,700
How's that?

272
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,466
Sounds like a blond.

273
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,232
Listen, don't fool around
There all afternoon.

274
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:51,465
Get that old pump out of there, will you,
So I can put the new one in right away?

275
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:52,964
Maybe we can pull
Out of there tonight.

276
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:56,897
Oh, sure. Sure. I'll
Work on it all afternoon.

277
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,629
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

278
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,129
All afternoon.

279
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,295
Yeah. Ok. Good-bye.

280
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,595
All set. Have we
Got a car?

281
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,127
Yes. Why?

282
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,093
We got to go to wichita, haven't we?

283
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:11,159
Oh.

284
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,760
We got to meet the gunner, haven't we?

285
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,958
Oh. And he arrives
There when?

286
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:17,791
Around 5:00
This afternoon.

287
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:19,790
And in the meanwhile?

288
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,758
I'll entertain you
There.

289
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,423
Oh. I thought you
Had to work here.

290
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:25,955
Oh, no, no.
That's hard work.

291
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:27,489
Come on.
Come on, pal.

292
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,289
We're wasting time.
Wichita is calling.

293
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:30,621
Here. Come on.

294
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,121
And wear that
Red dress, will you?

295
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,453
What?

296
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,287
How did you know
I had a red dress?

297
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,319
Oh, I got
In the wrong room.

298
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:45,584
Good-bye, father.
Good-bye, mother.

299
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:46,983
Bye. You all be back
For supper?

300
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:47,950
We will.

301
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,982
And, Mr. Lane?

302
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,149
Yes, mother?

303
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:51,650
I'll have a cot all
Fixed up for your friend.

304
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,215
All right, mother. And
The towels are in the hall.

305
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:54,215
What?

306
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,582
Shh! Shut up!

307
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,213
Horseshoe!
Horseshoe!

308
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:06,078
Beautiful!
Beautiful!

309
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,111
Oh!

310
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,444
You can see now why wichita's
Going to win this league.

311
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:11,577
What's that
You say, lady?

312
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:13,076
Wichita's going to
Win what?

313
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,743
It's in the bag, omaha,
And you're holding it.

314
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,908
Yeah. That was
A smart play, eh?

315
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:19,708
The smartest play you've
Seen today, mister.

316
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:21,708
Ask your pitcher what's
The last thing he expected,

317
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:23,374
And he'll tell you
A hit and run.

318
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:24,873
What a beauty!

319
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,606
Two outs,
A man on first,

320
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,706
And 3 and 1
On the batter. Yeah.

321
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:30,938
And that second baseman
Isn't surprised much.

322
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:33,005
Look at him! He can't
Get over it!

323
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:34,870
I think this guy is right.
It was horseshoed.

324
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,869
Why, sure. Listen. See, it's the
Luckiest ball club in the business.

325
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:39,802
It's kept them up there
All year.

326
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:41,602
What's the matter,
Second baseman?

327
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:44,369
Can't you get over
The surprise?

328
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:47,134
I see what you mean. You mean wichita's
Been getting breaks like this all year?

329
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,799
All year. I never seen
Anything like that.

330
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,433
Your girl
Is just prejudiced.

331
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:56,365
Women don't know anything
About baseball, anyway.

332
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:57,632
What's all this?

333
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,230
Watch the game, pal.
Watch the game.

334
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:10,961
There they are.

335
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,227
Yeah. We're
Just in time.

336
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,426
I love you.

337
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,092
"I love you, too."

338
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,092
I love you, too.

339
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:25,391
Shh!

340
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:37,588
Look, Jim. Look at that.
Look at that!

341
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:41,586
Could you do that?

342
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:45,418
Will you stop? Look at
All the space he's taking.

343
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,784
Well, there's
Plenty of it.

344
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:48,783
Come on.

345
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:49,817
Where?

346
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:51,117
Never mind.

347
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,515
How do you like it?

348
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:59,148
Oh, it's great!

349
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:06,280
Whoo!

350
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,802
Oh, that was
Wonderful!

351
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,636
Simply wonderful.

352
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:48,603
Oh!

353
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:49,635
Whoops!

354
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:50,934
Take it easy, pal. Take it easy.

355
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:52,468
You all right?

356
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,600
Oh, yes.
I'm all right.

357
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,099
But I'm all right now.

358
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,099
Oh!

359
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,233
Thanks, ray.
Whoa! Whoa.

360
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,598
Well!

361
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:09,496
Hello, darling.

362
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:10,496
I'm in no mood
For gags.

363
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:11,928
Shake hands
With ann instead.

364
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:13,761
Oh, you only got
One this time, huh?

365
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:14,895
Where's mable?

366
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,595
She must have seen
Your picture somewhere.

367
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:18,061
Hello, hello, hello.

368
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:19,926
Where did you
See each other?

369
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,926
I picked her off a cloud
And got dizzy. Come on.

370
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,325
Thanks, pal.

371
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,425
Hey.

372
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,391
What?

373
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:32,123
Do you know what
I'm thinking about?

374
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,957
Am I in it?

375
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:36,456
It's a wish.

376
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:39,788
Ohh. What?

377
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:42,621
That it was
This morning again.

378
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:45,287
Could you do it all over again tomorrow?

379
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:46,786
Could you?

380
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:50,285
I never had a better
Time, ann. And you?

381
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,285
The best.

382
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,384
There's a new show
There tonight.

383
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:55,384
Where?

384
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,850
Wichita.

385
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,550
Oh. How about
Your friend?

386
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,882
You want him
To go with us?

387
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:03,382
No.

388
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:11,380
You're going to have
A nice sleep tonight, pal.

389
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:14,046
Yeah.

390
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,744
Did you get
That pump off? No.

391
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:17,744
No, I didn't.

392
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:19,078
That's fine.
That's fine.

393
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:20,578
I had to go to wichita, didn't I?

394
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:21,578
Oh, sure. Sure.

395
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:22,578
I had to meet you,
Didn't I?

396
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:23,577
Oh, yeah. Sure.

397
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:24,577
I didn't want you
To get lost, did I?

398
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:25,742
No, no, no, no.

399
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:26,909
Be a little
Grateful then.

400
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,409
Grate-for what?

401
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:29,908
Aren't you glad
To meet ann?

402
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:31,408
Sure, I'm glad
To meet ann.

403
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:32,374
Sure, I'm gl-

404
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:33,441
Ha ha!

405
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:36,106
Any chance of getting
Out of here tonight?

406
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:39,439
Nah. Not a chance. Wait'll
You see where she lives.

407
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:44,071
Oh, a little house sailing along
All by itself in a sea of wheat.

408
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:46,770
And a cute little cot
For you to sleep on.

409
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,103
Yeah. And wait'll you
Smell them honeysuckles.

410
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:54,035
Don't give me that banjo. What
Time can we get out tomorrow?

411
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:55,669
Well, I'm ready
Whenever you are.

412
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:59,200
That's all I wanted to know.
We're leaving early.

413
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:04,099
You usually at least bring
The ship home when you flop,

414
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,232
But maybe you ain't
Jim Lane after all.

415
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,931
Ok, chicago. Should've
Been with me this morning.

416
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,931
Had them colorado
Mountains melting.

417
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:13,230
And tomorrow morning, I'll
Have that ship in new york

418
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,330
Before you can
Pack up your tools.

419
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:21,694
Oh.

420
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:23,061
What?

421
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,527
Joe.

422
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,893
Oh.

423
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,892
My sweetheart.

424
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:30,226
Oh. This is new.
She's got a sweetheart.

425
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,559
Yeah.

426
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,025
And he's
Sweet, too.

427
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:36,057
I wonder what
He's doing here.

428
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,890
He's probably here
To see you.

429
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,889
Yes.

430
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,623
Tell him he'll
Do better tomorrow.

431
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:41,756
Hello!

432
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,088
Hello.

433
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:47,254
Hello, Mr. Lane. You look
Just the way you ought to.

434
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:48,221
Hi, Joe.

435
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:49,588
Joe, this
Is gunner.

436
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:50,587
Hello.

437
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:52,086
Hello, Joe.
Glad to see you.

438
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,487
Gee, you
Had me worried.

439
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:54,885
I thought you'd forgotten about tonight.

440
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,519
Oh. Is it tonight?

441
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,485
Yes. Did you
Forget?

442
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:00,418
We're having
A dance, Mr. Lane.

443
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,684
Wouldn't you both
Like to come?

444
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:06,116
No. I'm afraid
We can't get away.

445
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:08,183
I'll get you
Some nice girl.

446
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:10,348
I don't think
They'd like it.

447
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,181
Come on.
Wait for me, Joe.

448
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:17,179
Oh, thanks for
A lovely afternoon.

449
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,211
Yes, sir. Ain't no place
Like the country.

450
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,511
Hear them sounds
And smell them smells.

451
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,043
Hmm. Honeysuckle.

452
00:24:31,243 --> 00:24:33,709
Honeysuckle
And raspberries.

453
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,667
Hello.

454
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,699
Oh, hello, Mr. Lane.
Are you still up?

455
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:08,800
Hello.
How are you?

456
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,798
What have you
Been doing?

457
00:25:12,998 --> 00:25:16,631
Sitting here
And thinking.

458
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,464
Oh.

459
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:19,963
It's nice here.

460
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:22,662
Yes, it is
Nice here.

461
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:26,728
And she's decided to stay
At last, haven't you, ann?

462
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:29,494
Where was she going?

463
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,528
I was going
To the moon.

464
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:32,993
Mr. Lane will
Tell you about that.

465
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:35,026
He's been nearer
Than you have.

466
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:36,825
Uh, what is
The altitude record?

467
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:39,990
I don't know. It changes all the time.

468
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,956
What's all
The smiling about?

469
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:49,688
I've been trying to win ann
For a long time, Mr. Lane,

470
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:53,355
But she very frankly told
Me she wanted someone better,

471
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:54,987
And my understanding
Of that

472
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,020
Is probably why
I won her tonight.

473
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,919
I don't get you.

474
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:01,019
We're going to
Be married.

475
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:05,884
All right. All right.

476
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,783
The prince
Is puzzled.

477
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:11,150
What do you call him
The prince for?

478
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,983
Well, isn't he?

479
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,282
They used to ride white
Horses over some hill,

480
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:17,947
But nowadays they go so
Fast, they can't see straight.

481
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,646
Gee whiz, they go right
Around the world like that

482
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,646
Until they're right back over the hill

483
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:24,113
Where they
Started.

484
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:26,146
Do you know
What she means?

485
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:27,179
No.

486
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,445
I don't either.

487
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:32,843
When she talks like this,
Mr. Lane, I just let her go.

488
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:35,344
Now, Joe, kiss me
Good night.

489
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:36,343
I'm tired.

490
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:37,476
Right.

491
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:39,509
Good night, Mr. Lane,
And good-bye.

492
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:40,808
Good night, Joe.
Good luck.

493
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:42,342
Thanks.

494
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:44,974
Good night, dear.

495
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:46,808
Good night.

496
00:26:57,638 --> 00:27:01,270
She must have heard that talk
About a horse, and she's sore.

497
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:03,935
Good night!

498
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:05,602
Good night.

499
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:10,267
He's a nice fellow.

500
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,133
Did anyone ever
Nickname you "nice"?

501
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,298
No. Why?

502
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:20,132
It seems to be
Your favorite word.

503
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,464
He's still
A nice fellow.

504
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,596
And you think I made
A nice choice.

505
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:33,094
This is the life.

506
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:34,961
Sitting out here tonight's
The first time

507
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:38,293
I've ever felt peace
Since I was born.

508
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,392
It's a nice life.

509
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,458
I mean, it's fine.
Hey, you're a flip, girl.

510
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,458
Ha ha ha!

511
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:50,090
You're charming.

512
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,922
Yeah.

513
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:56,255
You turn your head like
A big bear and just gaze.

514
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:58,589
It looks as if you
Were making up your mind

515
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,087
Whether you'd jump
At somebody or not,

516
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:05,086
And then you just
Decide not to.

517
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,152
It's very charming.

518
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:09,152
Mm-hmm.

519
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:10,851
You've got me
Watching for it

520
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:13,084
And thinking up things
To make you do it.

521
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:14,083
Look.

522
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:15,484
I'll show you.

523
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,250
I'm you.

524
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:20,116
And somebody
Says something,

525
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:21,981
And you go, "hmm?"

526
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:28,813
Well, if that isn't going out of
Your way to get a laugh, I ask you.

527
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,611
Hey!

528
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:39,610
There. Ha ha! That's the way you do it.

529
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,976
Sure.

530
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,509
I'd go out of my way
Any day to get that.

531
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,475
What are you going to
Marry that guy for?

532
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,141
You don't love him.

533
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:52,606
What makes you
Suddenly say that?

534
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:54,906
Just the way
You're behaving now-

535
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,172
Like a little flirt.

536
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,705
I don't like you
For saying that.

537
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,038
That's tough. Look at the
Way you behaved all day.

538
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:04,903
One minute, you're going
To a show with me tonight.

539
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:07,069
The next, you get yourself
Engaged to him.

540
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,202
And then the minute he goes,
You're like this again.

541
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:13,235
Sure. That's right.

542
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:15,867
That's me.

543
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,668
Yeah.

544
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,932
And I rated you the
Best girl I ever saw.

545
00:29:22,132 --> 00:29:23,766
It's rotten to be
Disappointed.

546
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:26,398
You'll be gone
In the morning.

547
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,931
It will soon
Be here.

548
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:30,263
I wish
I got out tonight.

549
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:31,930
I wish
I'd never landed.

550
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,262
I wish
I never saw you.

551
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,562
What do you think
I wish?

552
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:40,295
Do you think
I like this?

553
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,827
What are you
Trying to say now?

554
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,293
All my life,
I've waited

555
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:45,826
For this morning
To come

556
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:47,326
Because I thought
It had come.

557
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:49,125
I thought
It had brought

558
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,459
What I'd longed for
So long.

559
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,424
Well, I was wrong.

560
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,956
It was just
A day to you.

561
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:58,256
All right,
You don't love me.

562
00:29:58,456 --> 00:30:00,122
What of it?

563
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:03,054
What did you get
Engaged to him for,

564
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:04,555
If that's the way
You feel?

565
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,555
Because I'm going to
Forget you-

566
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:08,053
Because he's fine-

567
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:11,186
Because I'm going to be a
Farmer's wife and a good one,

568
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:12,852
And don't kid yourself I'm not.

569
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:14,318
I'm grateful to you

570
00:30:14,518 --> 00:30:16,351
For making me
Forget dreams,

571
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:17,984
For giving me peace.

572
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,451
Is that clear, or do you
Want me to blueprint it?

573
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:24,450
What do you want me
To do-say I love you?

574
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,315
No! Not in
A million years...

575
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:30,314
If your heart were
Tearing for me.

576
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:32,980
I'd like to see you
Get me now.

577
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,480
It's over-complete.

578
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,812
It was a thrill to see
You come out of the sky.

579
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:40,446
It will be
A greater one

580
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:42,178
To see you
Disappear in it.

581
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:44,378
You better
Get up early...

582
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:46,277
Because
It will be early.

583
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:08,670
Well...

584
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,670
Give my regards
To Joe.

585
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,669
What will I tell him?

586
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:15,736
You don't need anybody to talk for you.

587
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,234
Give my love
To the wichita team.

588
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:10,422
Well, he got away,
All right.

589
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:11,920
Yeah.

590
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,421
When do you go?

591
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:14,919
Right away.

592
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,919
Catch the first
Transport out.

593
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,420
Oh.

594
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,918
Then you'll want
Somebody to...

595
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:23,050
Drive you to wichita.

596
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,215
Never mind, pal.
Never mind.

597
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,549
You'll be glad
In the end.

598
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,379
Ann!

599
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,278
Ann!

600
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,111
All right, mother.

601
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:49,894
I- I forgot my hat!

602
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,428
Jim, you didn't.

603
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,893
What?

604
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,360
You didn't forget
Your hat.

605
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,826
What did I forget?

606
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:57,359
You forgot me.

607
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,859
What are you
Talking about?

608
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,226
You did.
You couldn't go.

609
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:02,025
You came back.
You couldn't go.

610
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:04,025
Well, then get in.
Don't ask any questions.

611
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,523
Let's get
Out of here.

612
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:06,857
Get in? How?

613
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,356
Here.

614
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:14,689
You'll be sorry
For this.

615
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,286
All right.

616
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:21,886
Not a word anywhere.
It's a crash.

617
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:23,386
Who have you
Sent out?

618
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:24,885
Oh, everybody.
Everybody!

619
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:26,386
He isn't worth it,
Either.

620
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,884
What are you
Talking about?

621
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:29,884
Oh, I don't know what I'm talking about.

622
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:31,550
Here he comes.

623
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,682
What is this?

624
00:34:37,882 --> 00:34:39,048
I give up.

625
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:40,382
You know her?

626
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:41,547
Yes, sir.

627
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:42,847
Well, who is she?

628
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,381
The girl he left
This morning.

629
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:45,679
Oh, I give up.

630
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,046
Won't do any good.

631
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:48,480
Send him
Into my office.

632
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,412
That may do me
Some good.

633
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:54,810
That's all, frank.

634
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,844
This is my wife,
Gunner.

635
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:59,843
Oh, I've heard so much
About the gunner.

636
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:01,808
It's almost as if
I'd seen you before.

637
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,309
Now, wait a minute. I
Can't take any more today.

638
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,807
Just tell me about it
As it happened, will you?

639
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,340
I went back for her. We
Were married in indianapolis,

640
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,007
And now we're
With you again.

641
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:12,172
Married, huh?

642
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:13,473
Yeah. Where's Drake?

643
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:15,006
He's waiting
To congratulate you.

644
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,838
Hang on to her for me, will
You? I got to get some dough.

645
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:19,338
Gee, you must be
Surprised.

646
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:21,703
No, no, I'm not surprised.
I wouldn't be surprised

647
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:24,169
If he got married in indianapolis
And divorced in toledo.

648
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,036
I'm surprised
You didn't.

649
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:28,469
Now, listen to this.

650
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:29,968
You start out.

651
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,700
You're off on
A great adventure,

652
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,201
Carrying with you

653
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:35,899
The best we can give
You in work and hope.

654
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,531
You're due here
In 7 hours,

655
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,531
And aviation's supposed
To be advanced 7 years,

656
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,031
And what happens?

657
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:47,030
You arrive here 37 hours
Late and with a girl.

658
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,496
Now, I ask you!

659
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:51,495
Ha ha ha! Yeah,
But how she fits it-

660
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:53,794
You know,
One peach to another.

661
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:57,827
You're going to test that
Thompson racer on thursday.

662
00:35:58,027 --> 00:35:59,327
Tomorrow's tuesday.

663
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:02,326
That will give you a couple
Of days for a honeymoon.

664
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,825
Well, the best of luck
To you. How's that?

665
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:07,292
Well, how about a couple
Of hundred in advance?

666
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,459
All right.

667
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:10,557
Right. I'll see you
A week from thursday.

668
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,589
No, no, no, no, no!
This thursday.

669
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,622
I heard you-
A week from thursday.

670
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:17,322
I'm sorry. The national air
Races won't wait for a honeymoon!

671
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:18,822
This thursday!

672
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,288
Right-a week
From thursday.

673
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:21,321
Lane!

674
00:36:21,521 --> 00:36:22,321
Yeah?

675
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,786
Wait a minute.

676
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:25,820
Yes, sir.

677
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,353
If Jim Lane asks
For any money,

678
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,719
Tell him he's no longer on the payroll.

679
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,784
Yes, Mr. Drake.

680
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,452
You can still
Change your mind.

681
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,017
Who'll you get
In my place?

682
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:37,184
Benson!

683
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:39,183
Ha ha! You'll
Change yours.

684
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:41,849
Say, Jim, you've got
The idea in your head

685
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,514
You're the only aviator
In the world, haven't you?

686
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:47,980
No, but you have.
Ha ha ha!

687
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,745
There's
Lane's dough.

688
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:58,278
He's got all
The answers, too.

689
00:36:58,478 --> 00:36:59,777
Tell barney
To study it

690
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:02,310
And then come in here
And see me.

691
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:05,842
Well, I got it.

692
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,042
How much?

693
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:09,442
The gate. Yeah, he's
Pulled a lot of beauties,

694
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:12,308
But this one he dressed up for the ball
- I'm fired.

695
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:14,274
Jim! Jim, fly for me.
Fly mine.

696
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:16,306
I've got the fastest ship
In the world.

697
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:17,772
Hello, stuart.
Oh, and get this-

698
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:20,272
Listen, Jim, I've given 3
Good years designing that ship.

699
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,805
If I win the thompson,
I'll have a factory in a year!

700
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,304
Hey, grant,
Hey, hey.

701
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:26,804
You know I'm broke, Jim.
I can't give you any dough,

702
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,303
But if you win,
The whole 10 grand is yours!

703
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:31,802
How can he fire you? We're
Testing the racing job on thursday.

704
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,802
I don't feel like
Testing it thursday.

705
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:34,802
Listen, Jim-

706
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,335
Hey, look, look,
Will you blow?

707
00:37:36,535 --> 00:37:38,435
Come on, gunner. Don't
Be that way. Come see her!

708
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:41,000
Every day's like this,
So don't worry.

709
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,300
Charming.

710
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,799
I saw her
Before she started.

711
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:45,299
And you said
She was fast.

712
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:46,965
You ok'd all that dope.
Remember, gunner?

713
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,965
Yeah, yeah, and I told you
Ought to run her on dope, too.

714
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,496
Remember? She's fast,
And she's crazy.

715
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:56,229
Oh, he's kidding you.
It's a good boat.

716
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,761
No, no.
It's too fast.

717
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:00,494
You know, I like them slow
And steady. What do you say?

718
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,994
I got a wife and $10.
What more do you want?

719
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:04,460
Got me beat
Both ways.

720
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,993
And I know
What I've got.

721
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:08,393
I thought you were pretty crazy
Without thinking, darling,

722
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,259
But I didn't know
You were that crazy.

723
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,025
Jim! Jim,
If I buy a drink,

724
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:13,824
Will you take
A look at her?

725
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:16,258
No, but if you buy two
Drinks, we'll sit in her.

726
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,290
If I buy 3 drinks,
Will you race her?

727
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,756
No!

728
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,722
Glad to have met you.

729
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,788
You mean I'm
As crazy as that?

730
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:27,288
You're worse, honey.

731
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,287
Gunner, he buys
A ring for 600.

732
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:32,119
He marries a girl.
He has $10 in the world.

733
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:34,686
He loses his job,
And he comes out laughing.

734
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:36,285
Yeah, it's all
Very funny.

735
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,785
We're wasting time. How much
Dough have you really got?

736
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,984
I had 200 coming, but
That was this morning.

737
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,117
Well, who took it?

738
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,150
Indianapolis.

739
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,617
All right, I'll
Cut you in on the 10.

740
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:49,715
What will we do first?
We've got to get a house.

741
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:51,315
Don't you live anywhere,
Darling?

742
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:54,081
No. Gunner and I move around.
We've got our clothes in a room.

743
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,913
There's some apartments over on 81st
Street we'd like. Let's grab one.

744
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:58,578
Don't you have to pay
Anything in advance?

745
00:38:58,778 --> 00:38:59,578
No.

746
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:00,745
How do you know?

747
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:02,911
I don't know. I just
Know that you don't.

748
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:04,378
How are you,
Gunner, old boy?

749
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:06,743
Oh, I'm great. I got the
Whole thing figured out.

750
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:09,693
I'm going to be associated
With two nuts instead of one.

751
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:11,742
Why, gunner.
Why, gunner.

752
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,076
What are you
Looking at?

753
00:39:13,276 --> 00:39:14,575
I found a dime.

754
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:17,274
Ooh, it's nice.

755
00:39:17,474 --> 00:39:18,440
We'll take it.

756
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,941
Darling, we've only seen
This room.

757
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,572
We'll look
At the rest of it.

758
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:23,606
I think that would be a very good idea.

759
00:39:23,806 --> 00:39:24,939
The doors work good.

760
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,772
What do you think
Of this room, dear?

761
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:27,939
I think it's fine.

762
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,271
I'm glad you do.

763
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,238
Does he always take
Everything like this?

764
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,736
He's inclined to. He's very
Much of a hurry-up gentleman.

765
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,236
They're the very first to
Complain if anything goes wrong.

766
00:39:36,436 --> 00:39:37,769
Does philosophy go
With the joint,

767
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,768
Or do we get that
On the side?

768
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:41,734
Come on, dear. Let's
Look at the kitchen.

769
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:43,267
Yeah, ok.
Oh. Ok!

770
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,267
I think we'd like
To have it very much.

771
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,799
The faucets
Are nice.

772
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:51,631
That will be one month in advance, please
- $150.

773
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:55,797
Ahem. It's your turn to turn
On the speed, isn't it, pal?

774
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,797
He's a crazy loon,
Isn't he?

775
00:39:57,997 --> 00:39:59,297
He's a test pilot.

776
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,796
Oh, you try airplanes out before we do.

777
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:04,795
Mm-hmm, and they try
Themselves out before I do.

778
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,261
Can I see the kitchen
Again?

779
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,794
Surely. If you notice,
It's a brand-new stove.

780
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,760
I wouldn't miss this
For anything.

781
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,626
Look, that was
Just an excuse.

782
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:14,425
I wanted to speak
To you alone.

783
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,425
Oh.

784
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,092
What do you think
Of that girl?

785
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,958
Why, I should think
She's very nice.

786
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:20,292
We just got married.

787
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:21,657
Oh, did you?
Just today?

788
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:22,823
Just now.

789
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:24,324
Where were you married,
Mr. Lane?

790
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:25,589
Indianapolis.

791
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:27,323
Indi-maybe you think you're
Still in indianapolis.

792
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:29,821
Huh? Oh, no, dear.
I see what you mean.

793
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:31,655
No, no, we were
Married in indianapolis

794
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,987
A couple of hours ago.
Came here in a plane.

795
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:35,787
Oh, not as crazy
As that, pal, really.

796
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:37,686
Do I think this is
Indianapolis? Ha ha!

797
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:39,818
And look, get this.
She never was here.

798
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:41,585
First time
In new york, see?

799
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:43,984
Well, now, I got to show
Her around good, haven't I?

800
00:40:44,184 --> 00:40:45,984
It takes a little dough,
Right? You said it.

801
00:40:46,184 --> 00:40:47,950
Does this mean you
Can't pay me in advance?

802
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,816
No, no, no. Don't bother
About that, honey.

803
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:52,216
Look, I want to borrow
A hundred bucks from you.

804
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,615
Mr. Lane.

805
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:55,881
Well, next week I'll
Have plenty of dough.

806
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,681
In my business,
You make it that way.

807
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:00,480
I'm always in the hole from 5 to 10
Grand, and then I pay it back in one sweep.

808
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,813
I don't owe
Anybody yet.

809
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:03,013
But, Mr. Lane-

810
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,479
Yeah, listen.
She likes you.

811
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,279
I don't give out the blarney.
You know what I mean by that,

812
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,379
But sometimes
- I want that dough very much.

813
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:12,278
If I didn't like you, I
Wouldn't ask you for a quarter,

814
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:15,277
But it's fun asking you for dough.
I'm enjoying this, aren't you?

815
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:16,976
Well, I don't know.

816
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:19,942
Of course, if it's going to leave you
Short, don't give it another thought.

817
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,208
Mr. Lane, I have
Exactly $9.00,

818
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:25,274
But you may have it
If it will help you any.

819
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:28,307
Darling, I got you
Beat by a buck.

820
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,239
You keep it. Ann!

821
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:32,139
Yes?

822
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:33,338
A lovely woman.

823
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:35,604
Yes, dear, and did you like
The new stove?

824
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:37,803
Mm-hmm. She was right.
It's a brand-new stove.

825
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:40,303
Well, the stove isn't the
Only new thing in this kitchen.

826
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:41,802
I understand
You just married him.

827
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,801
You didn't have no chance
Not to, did you?

828
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:47,302
Not any,
And neither did he.

829
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:49,767
Glad you're going to
Live here...

830
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,268
I guess.

831
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,066
Ha ha ha!

832
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:55,732
You've got
A new girl.

833
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,632
Yeah. I still got the
10, and that's all.

834
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:01,164
I got to stick another
Zero on it somehow.

835
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:04,429
We don't need any more.
I'll try out the new stove.

836
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:05,996
Gunner!

837
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:13,228
You know, sometime when we might
Be starving to death or something-

838
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:14,760
But the 9 bucks got me.

839
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,759
The minute she pulled out the
Old pocketbook, I knew I was sunk.

840
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,759
I should have known better
Than to listen.

841
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,758
Here, here. Stick it
Away and stop beefing.

842
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,259
Save it
For a snowstorm.

843
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,258
How do you like that? I'll bet
You this 10 against that dime

844
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,590
He's got this
Before morning.

845
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,257
Oh, what a lovely
Way to live!

846
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:32,257
Yeah, and if we ever get
Hungry, we can always cook this.

847
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:33,722
Oh! Right
On the new stove?

848
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:36,256
Mm-hmm. We got a hundred
Bucks, a new house,

849
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:38,255
And a city. Where do we head first?

850
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,754
I'll fix this first.

851
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:42,220
All right. What do you
Think of it?

852
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,753
This works good.

853
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:45,253
Suits you ok, huh?

854
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:48,252
Sure. I'll come over and
Visit you from time to time.

855
00:42:48,452 --> 00:42:49,584
Oh, yeah?

856
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,750
Now, this is your room,
Or we don't play.

857
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,217
Ok, sucker?

858
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,716
Say, uh, it's 6:00. The
Stores close at half past.

859
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,215
What stores?

860
00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:01,681
Oh, ain't you going to
Buy her anything?

861
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:03,680
Tomorrow, everything. She
Doesn't need anything tonight.

862
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,214
What's the matter
With you?

863
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:07,213
She needs a nightgown,
Don't she?

864
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:08,746
Oh.

865
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:10,745
She's a lady,
You mug.

866
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:13,745
Yeah. Yeah, I guess she
Does at that, doesn't she?

867
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:15,711
Well,
Be just as well.

868
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:17,245
Yeah, yeah,
You're right.

869
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,576
Anything else
You can think of?

870
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,942
Oh, darling, it's
Going to be lovely here.

871
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:26,574
Wait until I've changed it all around.

872
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:29,573
What are you
So serious about?

873
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,207
Say, you've got to buy
Something before we have dinner.

874
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:33,539
Oh, what?

875
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,039
A nightgown.

876
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,038
Ha ha ha!
Why, darling.

877
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:38,705
What's the matter?

878
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:40,737
I'm so surprised.

879
00:43:40,937 --> 00:43:43,104
Oh. Ha ha!

880
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:46,936
Will you buy it
For me?

881
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:48,435
Me?

882
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:49,935
Please.

883
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:51,768
Ha ha ha!

884
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,201
Where do you
Find them?

885
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,733
Just ask for
The lingerie department.

886
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,600
That's all
I'm going to tell you.

887
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,867
The lawnja what?

888
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:01,367
The lingerie department.
Why don't you ask him?

889
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:06,165
Uh, where's the, uh-

890
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:09,197
The lawnjer,
Uh, department?

891
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,663
The what, sir?

892
00:44:10,863 --> 00:44:12,163
The lawnjer-

893
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:13,696
Nightgowns!

894
00:44:13,896 --> 00:44:15,229
Oh, for yourself,
Sir?

895
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:16,728
No.

896
00:44:16,928 --> 00:44:19,528
The ladies' department
On the third floor, sir.

897
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:22,227
Third floor.

898
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,226
Well, it ain't
My fault.

899
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,892
Here we are, darling.
Now, it's my present,

900
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:31,891
So I'm going to make
Believe I'm not with you.

901
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:33,390
Go right ahead.

902
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,190
Go on.

903
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:37,856
That's right.

904
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:39,189
Hey, come on.

905
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:42,055
Go on, go on. Come on,
Let's get out of here.

906
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:44,021
Go on, will you?
All right now.

907
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:45,853
Hey.

908
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:50,086
How do you do?

909
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:51,752
Uh, a nightgown
For a lady.

910
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:53,685
Yes, sir. What color
Does she fancy, sir?

911
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:55,252
Color?

912
00:44:57,683 --> 00:44:59,950
Hey, what color you think
She likes?

913
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,950
You can't go wrong
With pink.

914
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,482
No? Let's see
The pinks.

915
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:04,949
Yes, sir.

916
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:06,481
She'll think you're
Buying flowers.

917
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:09,181
Here's the very latest
Thing from paris, sir.

918
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:12,180
This is very pretty
And very reasonable.

919
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,180
How tall is
The young lady?

920
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,679
About his size.

921
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,678
36, I'd say. You just feel
The texture of that, sir.

922
00:45:19,878 --> 00:45:22,212
It feels all right.
Feel it.

923
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:24,211
It feels good.

924
00:45:24,411 --> 00:45:28,009
Yeah, I should say
That's about the right size.

925
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,675
Hey, hey, hey.

926
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,707
Yeah, wrap it up.

927
00:45:33,907 --> 00:45:35,340
Are you being
Waited on, lady?

928
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,407
Brilliantly.

929
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:37,906
What's the damage?

930
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:39,439
$60, please,
Sir.

931
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,705
Well, the "please"
Goes with it, anyway.

932
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,039
Say, this is a good business,
Isn't it?

933
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:45,704
We do very well
Here, sir.

934
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:47,337
Yes, I see
What you mean.

935
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,870
Well, there it is.

936
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,369
Got a good start.

937
00:45:50,569 --> 00:45:52,536
It was your idea.
I hope you're satisfied.

938
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:55,668
Yeah. I'd like to know
What I get out of it!

939
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:00,134
Thanks. Rural england, the netherlands,

940
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:01,967
France, italy,
Sweden-

941
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,201
Sweden!

942
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:05,166
Yeah, sweden's fine, and
Bulgaria and those burgs.

943
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,499
Sweden first. You better
Look up the hotels, gunner.

944
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:09,798
Don't you think we better
Look up a plane

945
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:12,164
To win the race
Before I hire the rooms?

946
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:14,664
I'm flying for Drake. He'll
Be looking all over town

947
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,297
For me by tomorrow,
And you know it.

948
00:46:16,497 --> 00:46:17,996
Yeah, and you can't
Lose the race.

949
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:20,162
I might as well switch the
10,000 to swedish dough.

950
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:21,829
Ann, those babies are
All broke over there.

951
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,627
Do you realize how much swedish
Dough you can get for 10 grand?

952
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:27,127
Darling, I happen to know. They'll
Elect you king of something.

953
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,027
They won't let us out of town.
We'll hire a castle on the nile.

954
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:31,325
The nile?
The nile?

955
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:33,692
Whatever their river is.
They've all got a river.

956
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:36,025
And so they have, precious.
Darling, I've got to kiss you.

957
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:37,524
The only thing
That bothers me-

958
00:46:37,724 --> 00:46:40,523
Why do we go to cleveland at
All and waste all that time?

959
00:46:40,723 --> 00:46:42,190
You don't think
I can lose, do you?

960
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,355
The gunner doesn't,
Either.

961
00:46:43,555 --> 00:46:45,488
I don't know.
He lost when he met you.

962
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:46,955
Gunner,
Look what he won.

963
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:50,105
Watch us, baby, and we'll show
You a little swedish massage.

964
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:56,618
Hey.

965
00:46:56,818 --> 00:46:57,618
What?

966
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:58,618
Drake.

967
00:46:58,818 --> 00:46:59,618
Where?

968
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:00,784
Guy with the hair.

969
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,984
Oh.

970
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:03,285
How's it going?

971
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:04,650
Hello, Jim.

972
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,283
Every day will be
Thursday, by and by.

973
00:47:12,315 --> 00:47:13,815
He's going to pay
For that.

974
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:15,115
What, dear?

975
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,980
Didn't ask me
To come back, did he?

976
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,930
Trying to wait me out. All
Right, I've got another idea.

977
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:22,612
All right, I got
Nothing more to say.

978
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:25,611
Yes, I have. I've got one
Thing to say to you, ann.

979
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:26,844
Yes?

980
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,644
Don't let him fly grant's
Ship. It's dangerous.

981
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:29,977
Is it, honey?

982
00:47:30,177 --> 00:47:32,476
She's got your number. Don't
Pay any attention to him.

983
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:34,508
I've had to listen
To this for years.

984
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,009
"don't do this." "don't do
That." "don't do anything."

985
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:38,674
Well, I'm going to
Fly grant's ship,

986
00:47:38,874 --> 00:47:41,175
And Drake will rue the day
For being so fresh.

987
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,339
How do you like that one-
"rue the day"?

988
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:46,339
I'm picking up words. She
Went to school. Here we are.

989
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,603
Oh, can you spare
A dollar, sweets?

990
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,104
Oh, yeah,
Sure, sure.

991
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:57,069
Here, take it all-
All of $3.00.

992
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:59,936
Oh, no, just a dollar. I
Want to buy a toothbrush.

993
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:01,868
White teeth-
Don't you want them?

994
00:48:03,302 --> 00:48:04,600
$2.20.

995
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,101
$2.20? Ahem.

996
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,934
He's got it.

997
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:12,565
Oh, wait a minute! Jim,
Don't forget my package!

998
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:13,765
What package?

999
00:48:13,965 --> 00:48:14,799
My nightgown!

1000
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:16,231
Oh! Hey!

1001
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:19,630
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1002
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,629
We left a package!

1003
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,127
Ha ha ha!

1004
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:35,626
Well, see you
Later.

1005
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:37,126
Hey, where are you
Going?

1006
00:48:37,326 --> 00:48:39,125
I'll go over and pick up our clothes

1007
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:40,491
Before somebody
Pinches them.

1008
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:43,158
I'll get everything together
And see you in the morning.

1009
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:45,657
Gunner, where do you wish
I were right now-

1010
00:48:45,857 --> 00:48:47,656
Back in kansas
Sitting on a fence?

1011
00:48:47,856 --> 00:48:49,157
Why do you
Say that?

1012
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:50,655
How long has it been

1013
00:48:50,855 --> 00:48:52,622
Since you've said good night
To him outside?

1014
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:54,088
Believe me, it's a relief. Somebody else

1015
00:48:54,288 --> 00:48:57,088
Can put him to bed for a change.

1016
00:48:57,288 --> 00:48:59,254
Gunner, help me
Make you like me.

1017
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:00,753
Sure, I do.

1018
00:49:00,953 --> 00:49:03,752
Don't wish I were
Back on the fence.

1019
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:06,085
You were so dear
To me.

1020
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:08,583
Gee, was it really
Just this morning?

1021
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:11,084
Don't expect any day
To be any different.

1022
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:14,083
Just gather thy happiness
While thy mayest.

1023
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:17,615
Must have gone to school
Myself at one time or another.

1024
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:19,782
You big dumb-

1025
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:22,281
Oh, go to bed.

1026
00:49:33,978 --> 00:49:35,276
Good afternoon,
Ladies and gentlemen.

1027
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:36,610
Welcome
To the cleveland airport

1028
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,576
For the final day
Of the national air races.

1029
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,575
This is the windup of the greatest series
Of events ever seen at any air race,

1030
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:44,608
And this afternoon the eyes not only
Of those of us here at the field,

1031
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:47,607
But of the whole world will be
Focused on the grand prix of aviation,

1032
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:49,507
The testing ground
Of both men and planes,

1033
00:49:49,707 --> 00:49:51,639
The world's most grueling
Competitive speed race,

1034
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,140
The thompson
Trophy race.

1035
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,139
There's the army bombardment
Group taking off

1036
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:58,104
For an exhibition of practice
Maneuvers and of dive-bombing.

1037
00:49:58,304 --> 00:50:00,804
The squadron, upon reaching
Their rendezvous...

1038
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:03,070
Ok, Jim, everything is great.
Isn't it, gunner?

1039
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,136
Ok, you just go up there, boy.
You cannot lose!

1040
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,468
Can he, gunner?
Just go up there, boy.

1041
00:50:08,668 --> 00:50:10,601
You cannot lose.
You got the finest-

1042
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:12,767
Up in the grandstand,
Up in the grandstand.

1043
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:16,134
Yeah, yeah. If you're not here
When I come back, I'll understand.

1044
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:17,298
Ok, ok.

1045
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:18,799
Yeah, ok, ok.

1046
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,132
Ha ha! Well,
Does she go?

1047
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:23,664
She goes,
But don't ask me where.

1048
00:50:23,864 --> 00:50:26,663
Well, this is a funny
Situation, isn't it, Jim?

1049
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:28,163
You miss me?

1050
00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:29,662
Yeah. Is it mutual?

1051
00:50:29,862 --> 00:50:31,163
Well, it doesn't
Seem natural.

1052
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:32,628
I'll give you
That much.

1053
00:50:32,828 --> 00:50:34,095
Benson's all right.

1054
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:35,660
Oh, sure,
Benson's all right.

1055
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,161
He's a little bit
Worried.

1056
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,660
Oh?

1057
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,160
Yeah. He says the new ship is so fast

1058
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,658
He's afraid the judges won't
Be able to count the laps.

1059
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:46,657
Ha ha! He spent
The dough already.

1060
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:49,158
He's taking his family to italy.

1061
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:50,623
How's thursday
Feeling?

1062
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:52,157
Who?

1063
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:53,556
Your pretty wife.

1064
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:54,922
Oh, yeah! Ha ha!

1065
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:56,455
Hey, where is
Thursday?

1066
00:50:56,655 --> 00:50:58,788
She's in the grandstand.
Where's friday? In the bar.

1067
00:50:58,988 --> 00:50:59,921
No, Jim, no.

1068
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:01,954
Yeah. We just got
Time for one.

1069
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,819
Scotch and a coke.

1070
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,019
A coke and a coke.

1071
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:08,186
Hiya, hiya,
Hiya, pal.

1072
00:51:08,386 --> 00:51:10,618
Well, hiya, pal. How
Are you? Glad to see you.

1073
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,251
Gunner, do you know
The mighty Benson?

1074
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:13,617
Oh, yeah-
The parachute jumper.

1075
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:16,250
You got good seats? Going to be
A nice race to watch.

1076
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,549
The battle for second place
Is going to be vicious.

1077
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:21,615
My wife's sitting pretty. You can
Buy a lot of seats for 10 grand.

1078
00:51:21,815 --> 00:51:23,615
You're a piker.
My wife's here with the kids.

1079
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:25,948
What do you want to
Disappoint all of them for?

1080
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:27,280
I hear you're
Going to italy.

1081
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Right from here, Jim.

1082
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,047
We'll meet you
In sweden.

1083
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:32,479
I'm not kidding. The missis has
Been harping about the mediterranean,

1084
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:35,511
But this is
The first real dough

1085
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,444
I've ever got ahold of.
Oh, oh, may!

1086
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:38,811
You know
Jim Lane.

1087
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:40,144
No. Ha ha!

1088
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:41,643
How do you do,
Mrs. Benson?

1089
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:43,642
And this is the gunner, his mechanic.

1090
00:51:43,842 --> 00:51:44,843
How do you do?

1091
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:46,309
The boys are drowning their sorrows.

1092
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:47,775
What will you have,
Mrs. Benson?

1093
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:50,109
I understand we're celebrating
A trip to the mediterranean.

1094
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:51,640
Oh, nothing,
Thanks.

1095
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,573
Oh. And I wish Fred would stop
Talking about the mediterranean.

1096
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:56,239
He's got me
Half-believing it,

1097
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:59,072
And as for the children,
They might as well be there.

1098
00:51:59,272 --> 00:52:00,572
Daddy!
Daddy!

1099
00:52:00,772 --> 00:52:03,105
Look, daddy, all pictures about italy.

1100
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:04,604
Have you ever
Been to italy?

1101
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:07,104
Mother says the sea
Is bluer than the sky.

1102
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:08,570
I want a drink!

1103
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,103
Ha ha! You want
A drink!

1104
00:52:10,303 --> 00:52:11,602
His father's boy.

1105
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:13,601
Good-bye. I'm awfully glad
To have met you.

1106
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:15,102
Thank you.
Good-bye.

1107
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:17,934
Attention! Pilots
For the thompson trophy race

1108
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,700
On the lines now!

1109
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:22,866
Now, ladies
And gentlemen,

1110
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:24,565
The big event of the year
In aviation-

1111
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:27,665
The thompson trophy race for
The 10 fastest planes in america.

1112
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:29,330
20 times around
This closed course

1113
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,031
In aviation's toughest
Competitive speed event.

1114
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,529
Why, it's annie.

1115
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,563
Yes! And to think
I left kansas for this.

1116
00:52:35,763 --> 00:52:37,528
I wonder what
Joe's doing now.

1117
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:39,561
Is this giving me
The laugh?

1118
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,627
Mm-hmm. There's a sucker
Born every second, pal.

1119
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:46,394
Not anymore.
I broke the mold.

1120
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:48,792
All clear?

1121
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:50,259
Clear!

1122
00:52:51,658 --> 00:52:53,092
Well, you can
Sing a song

1123
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:55,356
Of 10 grand, a pocketful of dough!

1124
00:52:55,556 --> 00:52:57,324
I'll see you
At the bank!

1125
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:01,056
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

1126
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:02,855
I won't!

1127
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:06,054
Oh, darling!

1128
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:07,054
Yeah!

1129
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:09,587
I got a telegram
From the landlady!

1130
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,586
Oh, yeah?
What did she say?

1131
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:13,087
She hopes you win!

1132
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:15,152
Here comes
The first entry racer-

1133
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:17,119
Number 7,
Flown by Jim Lane.

1134
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,417
Lane, you remember, won the
Thompson last year in a Drake special

1135
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:23,883
And set a new record
Of 259.108 miles per hour.

1136
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,282
There's the starter
Holding up his flag.

1137
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:29,082
Benny strong will be
Flying his number 86.

1138
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:31,581
The timers and judges
Are ready.

1139
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:35,214
There it goes!
They're away!

1140
00:54:30,232 --> 00:54:32,166
At the conclusion
Of the 16th lap,

1141
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:34,165
With only 40 miles
Left to go,

1142
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:35,664
Fred Benson
In his Drake special

1143
00:54:35,864 --> 00:54:38,730
Is still leading the field
And is averaging 279 miles...

1144
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:32,716
Now he's pushing
Benson hard!

1145
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,049
7 is riding
Right over 12!

1146
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:35,515
Now he's nosing down
For speed!

1147
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:37,048
Here they come
Down the stretch!

1148
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:38,547
Lane's pulling away
From Benson

1149
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:40,946
And going into an angled push.
There he goes!

1150
00:55:41,146 --> 00:55:44,712
Lane comes over the grandstand
And pulls out into the lead.

1151
00:55:47,246 --> 00:55:49,045
Uh-oh. There's something
Wrong up there.

1152
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,377
Lane's on fire!

1153
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:52,510
The grant mystery special
Is on fire,

1154
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,476
With the motor
Of the grant racer burning up!

1155
00:55:54,676 --> 00:55:57,542
Lane has the ship
Under perfect control...

1156
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:59,875
Come down, Jim.
Come on, don't be a fool.

1157
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,839
Oh, gunner.

1158
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,040
What's-
Why, he's going to continue!

1159
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,538
With only 15
More miles to go,

1160
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:13,672
Lane's going to gamble that
His ship will hold together!

1161
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:15,004
One more lap.

1162
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,337
He's on fire!

1163
00:56:16,537 --> 00:56:18,169
Ah, don't be crazy.
That's nothing.

1164
00:56:18,369 --> 00:56:20,469
It's nice to have
A little fire.

1165
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:23,502
You don't know how cold
It gets up there.

1166
00:56:23,702 --> 00:56:25,002
Jim! Jim!

1167
00:56:25,202 --> 00:56:27,167
Besides, the guy
Is made of asbestos.

1168
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,700
How can you talk like
That? How dare you!

1169
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,233
Why, you little fool,
Who are you talking to?

1170
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:35,198
What do you think this game is,
Anyway? It's death every time you move.

1171
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:37,264
It ain't safe to sit
In one of them!

1172
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:39,898
It ain't even safe
To look at one of them!

1173
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:42,897
And you married him without giving it
A thought. I'll say you're a sucker.

1174
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:46,897
Let me tell you another thing! If you're
With that guy long enough, you'll...

1175
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,793
Bless you, gunner.

1176
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,792
He's got
A good chance.

1177
00:57:01,992 --> 00:57:03,357
It's awful good
Up there.

1178
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:04,958
There he goes,
Diving into the pylon!

1179
00:57:05,158 --> 00:57:07,423
And look! Look!
The fire's out!

1180
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:08,790
He dove the fire out!

1181
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,889
Come on, Jim!
Come on, boy!

1182
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:18,854
Here he comes-
The winner!

1183
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:20,620
He's across the line.
Ladies and gentlemen...

1184
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,386
Oh!

1185
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:27,752
The grant mystery racer
Wins the thompson trophy race.

1186
00:57:27,952 --> 00:57:31,117
Here he comes in now.
Give him a big hand...

1187
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:37,482
Why, it's a beauty!

1188
00:57:37,682 --> 00:57:39,515
What were you doing,
Giving us an exhibition?

1189
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:43,015
Ha ha! Thursday!
Thursday! Sweet thursday!

1190
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:44,514
Aah!

1191
00:57:44,714 --> 00:57:45,980
Jim! Jim, that was
Marvelous!

1192
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,513
You made it!
Ha ha!

1193
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,445
Hey, hey, hey!

1194
00:57:49,645 --> 00:57:52,113
Oh, Benson's in trouble
- Benson in number 12!

1195
00:57:52,313 --> 00:57:54,544
It looks like he's going to
Crash! Everybody off the field!

1196
00:57:54,744 --> 00:57:56,844
Field guards,
To your stations immediately!

1197
00:58:14,606 --> 00:58:16,072
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please stay behind the fence

1198
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:17,305
And off the field.

1199
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:18,804
There's nothing you
Can do there

1200
00:58:19,004 --> 00:58:22,154
Save hinder those who are trying
Their best to help Fred Benson.

1201
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:27,902
How is he?

1202
00:58:28,102 --> 00:58:29,435
He's all right now.

1203
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:30,901
Let me through.

1204
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:31,901
I can't.

1205
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:34,400
Please. I'm Mrs. Benson.
It's him.

1206
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,300
Will you
Watch the-

1207
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,299
Joe, you and kathleen,
You watch the baby.

1208
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:40,799
Now, don't move,
Please.

1209
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:42,132
Mother!

1210
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,296
Mama! Mama!

1211
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:10,958
Wait for me.

1212
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:17,422
She in there?

1213
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:19,922
Taking him home
On the midnight.

1214
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:21,421
She alone?

1215
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:24,087
Children
Are in the hotel.

1216
00:59:25,954 --> 00:59:28,186
Well, that's
The way it goes.

1217
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:30,020
Oh, Jim.

1218
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,819
Yeah?

1219
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:35,351
Benson should never have
Been in that new racer.

1220
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,350
There's only one man
In all the country

1221
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,350
Should have been up
With her today, Jim.

1222
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,849
After this, let's you and
I stop this quarreling.

1223
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,848
Seems kind of silly.

1224
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:48,881
Yeah.

1225
00:59:49,081 --> 00:59:51,181
Go ahead.

1226
01:00:01,744 --> 01:00:03,544
I want to see
Mrs. Benson.

1227
01:00:03,744 --> 01:00:05,210
Yes, sir.

1228
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,207
Oh.

1229
01:00:13,407 --> 01:00:15,707
Congratulations,
Mr. Lane.

1230
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:18,007
It was very brave.

1231
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:23,072
I don't feel the way
I thought I would.

1232
01:00:23,272 --> 01:00:27,004
I guess I was so sure
It would happen sometime.

1233
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:29,170
How's the dough
Situation?

1234
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,769
Oh, we'll be all right.

1235
01:00:33,936 --> 01:00:35,635
You're lucky in one way, Mrs. Benson.

1236
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:37,168
I mean,
Lucky that I won.

1237
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:39,167
You see, Benson
And I were splitting

1238
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:40,667
If either of us
Came through,

1239
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:42,800
But I suppose
He told you.

1240
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,733
You what?

1241
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:46,699
Yeah. Didn't he
Tell you?

1242
01:00:46,899 --> 01:00:47,632
No.

1243
01:00:47,832 --> 01:00:50,764
Well, we were,
So I got it cashed.

1244
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,331
There's 5 grand
In the envelope.

1245
01:00:52,531 --> 01:00:53,330
Mr. Lane, please-

1246
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,997
You don't me
To welsh on a guy

1247
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:56,663
Because he's not here
To collect it, do you?

1248
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:57,696
But I-

1249
01:00:57,896 --> 01:00:59,362
But listen, keep it
Under your hat, see?

1250
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:01,361
I don't want Drake
To know that I thought

1251
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:03,361
He ever had
A chance to win.

1252
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:05,327
You know how it is.
We don't get on.

1253
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:08,292
Mr. Lane,
You're lying to me.

1254
01:01:08,492 --> 01:01:10,326
If you want
To put it that way-

1255
01:01:10,526 --> 01:01:13,324
Of course, it's
So beautiful of you.

1256
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:18,257
I- I do need it
So terribly.

1257
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:22,089
I mean, the children.
I mean, they're so-

1258
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:24,355
It's all right, pal.

1259
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:29,287
And listen, he died
At his trade, see?

1260
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:31,820
He has to die
Sometime, hasn't he?

1261
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,019
He died in the air, and the
Air is Benson's business.

1262
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,284
Yes. Yes, I know.

1263
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:43,917
And he-he was so dear.

1264
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:48,950
He wanted to take us
All to italy so much.

1265
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:51,815
I- I hope he's there.

1266
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,447
Ohh!

1267
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,780
Oh, god!

1268
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:08,011
If I had
The wings of an angel

1269
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:15,542
O'er these prison walls
I would fly

1270
01:02:15,742 --> 01:02:22,840
And fly to the arms
Of my darling

1271
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:30,738
And there
I'd be willing to die

1272
01:02:30,938 --> 01:02:32,771
Come on. Come on. Where is it?

1273
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:34,771
I'm right here, pal.
I'm right here.

1274
01:02:34,971 --> 01:02:36,803
Come on. The dough. The dough.

1275
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,735
Never mind the dough.
Waiter!

1276
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:39,969
Listen, ann,
That guy started

1277
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:41,135
With 10 grand,
All in cash,

1278
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:42,302
And he's
On a bender.

1279
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:43,734
Grab some of it,
Will you?

1280
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:45,734
I can't grab any.
It's too big.

1281
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:47,166
Attract
His attention.

1282
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:48,633
Gentlemen,
Your pleasure.

1283
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:49,667
Hi, dear!

1284
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:52,132
What kind of a drink
Is that-"hi, dear"?

1285
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:53,666
Oh, that's
A great drink.

1286
01:02:53,866 --> 01:02:57,664
"hi, dear"
Is a kansas drink.

1287
01:02:57,864 --> 01:02:59,130
It originated
In wichita.

1288
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:03,262
Oh! Well, then "hi,
Dear" is the best drink.

1289
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:09,761
Here.
Have a clean one.

1290
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:13,826
Well, well! Great day,
Mr. Drake. Great day.

1291
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:15,326
The best race by far.

1292
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:17,325
Not for me it wasn't, Mr. Brown.

1293
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:20,324
There's Lane and the boys.
I'm going to speak to them.

1294
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:22,324
I wouldn't bother. They're pretty drunk.

1295
01:03:22,524 --> 01:03:23,824
Let them alone.

1296
01:03:24,024 --> 01:03:27,057
Glad to do it, Mr. Drake.
Glad to do it.

1297
01:03:29,288 --> 01:03:31,055
Boys! Boys! Boys!

1298
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:34,087
Boys! Boys! Let me
Introduce myself.

1299
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:35,587
We know you!

1300
01:03:35,787 --> 01:03:37,086
He's the chamber
Of commerce!

1301
01:03:37,286 --> 01:03:38,587
He's the mayor!

1302
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:40,586
No, boys, no,
I'm not the mayor,

1303
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:43,618
But all the champagne
You can drink is on me.

1304
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:45,718
Waiter! Waiter!
Champagne for the boys!

1305
01:03:47,484 --> 01:03:48,951
He's
Mr. Cleveland!

1306
01:03:49,151 --> 01:03:53,049
No, no, but I know what these
Races mean to this fair city.

1307
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:54,715
Fair cleveland.

1308
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:00,948
Boys, boys!

1309
01:04:01,148 --> 01:04:03,780
I'm interrupting
This festive gathering

1310
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:07,612
For two reasons, which
Consists of two toasts.

1311
01:04:07,812 --> 01:04:10,478
The first, to Jim Lane,
Who won today,

1312
01:04:10,678 --> 01:04:13,110
The greatest race
In aviation history.

1313
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,710
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

1314
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,242
How does it feel to be the star? Gosh!

1315
01:04:17,442 --> 01:04:20,242
I'll pin it
On you, baby.

1316
01:04:20,442 --> 01:04:24,741
The second toast, to the man who
Sacrificed his life in the same race,

1317
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:26,974
Your buddy Fred Benson!

1318
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:31,239
Who's Benson?

1319
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:32,739
Never heard
Of him.

1320
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:34,038
Get going.

1321
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:35,372
Come on. Scram!

1322
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:37,904
Get out of here!
Come on!

1323
01:04:40,436 --> 01:04:41,737
Who is Benson?

1324
01:04:41,937 --> 01:04:43,736
Any of you guys
Ever hear of him?

1325
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:46,736
Yeah. Sure, sure. He's
The guy that went to italy.

1326
01:04:46,936 --> 01:04:49,768
What license
Did that guy ever have to fly?

1327
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:51,767
He didn't have any.
It's too tough, baby.

1328
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,233
The sky looks sweet
And wears

1329
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:55,266
A pretty blue dress,
Doesn't she? Yeah.

1330
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:56,933
Don't kid yourself.
She lives up there.

1331
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:58,365
She invites you
Up there,

1332
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:00,098
And when she gets you
Up there,

1333
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:02,264
She knocks you down.
A nice guy like Benson.

1334
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:03,864
Don't think, honey.

1335
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:05,897
I'm not thinking, honey.
I'm just telling you.

1336
01:05:06,097 --> 01:05:07,429
Benson wasn't
Good enough for her.

1337
01:05:07,629 --> 01:05:10,428
"come on. Get out of the
Sky. I don't like you."

1338
01:05:10,628 --> 01:05:12,762
Sure. That's her. But
Don't let her fool you

1339
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:14,261
When she looks
Soft and sweet.

1340
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:16,594
She sits in your lap
And purrs, doesn't she?

1341
01:05:16,794 --> 01:05:19,927
Yeah. She don't fool me none,
Because wham! And there it is.

1342
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,325
Fire is still fire.

1343
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:23,759
Stuck her little tongue
Out at me, didn't she?

1344
01:05:23,959 --> 01:05:25,925
All fiery red,
A kiss from cinderella.

1345
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:28,057
She didn't get away
With it, did she?

1346
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,023
Did she, kansas?
She got kissed right back.

1347
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:33,022
Yeah, and when you take her by
The throat, you shake her silly,

1348
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:36,555
You slap her back, you put her in
Her place, and you give her the left.

1349
01:05:36,755 --> 01:05:38,054
That vicious,
Scheming, rotten-

1350
01:05:38,254 --> 01:05:39,188
Darling-

1351
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:41,721
Waiter! Waiter! Waiter!

1352
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:43,220
Hey, what are you doing?

1353
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,219
I'm trying to get
Some of that dough.

1354
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,719
Is that any way to get
It? Gentlemen don't grab.

1355
01:05:47,919 --> 01:05:49,719
If you're going to grab,
Grab a waiter.

1356
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:51,217
Waiter! Waiter! Waiter!

1357
01:05:51,417 --> 01:05:52,718
Look, Jim,
You know you-

1358
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:55,550
I'll know you when you
Come back with a bottle.

1359
01:06:01,116 --> 01:06:02,448
Who are you?

1360
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:04,414
A girl.

1361
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:06,914
Yeah?
Who told you so?

1362
01:06:07,114 --> 01:06:08,914
You did.

1363
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:11,913
I don't even know
Your name.

1364
01:06:12,113 --> 01:06:13,912
I know yours.

1365
01:06:14,112 --> 01:06:15,879
I'm a famous guy.

1366
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,410
Yeah.

1367
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,377
I want
A blue dress.

1368
01:06:19,577 --> 01:06:20,911
Blue?

1369
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:23,409
She wears a blue dress up there.

1370
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:24,876
Who does?

1371
01:06:25,076 --> 01:06:27,809
Miss "up there."

1372
01:06:28,009 --> 01:06:30,341
I look nice
In blue.

1373
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:32,874
What do I get
For it?

1374
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:35,373
I'll purr
In your lap.

1375
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:37,873
You wore
A red dress once.

1376
01:06:38,073 --> 01:06:39,339
I've switched.

1377
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:41,204
You've what?

1378
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:44,170
What are you
Doing here anyway?

1379
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,537
What do you want?
Waiter! Waiter!

1380
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,369
Gunner, will you
Take me home?

1381
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:49,336
You sick?

1382
01:06:49,536 --> 01:06:50,669
No. I'm just
Tired.

1383
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:52,034
What's the matter?

1384
01:06:52,234 --> 01:06:54,535
Come on now, Jim. It's time
For all of us to go home.

1385
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:56,534
All right. You go right along.
I'll be right along after.

1386
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:58,000
Thanks for the party,
Darling.

1387
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,867
Going to be a lot
Of them, honey.

1388
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:01,700
Take her along home,
Gunner. She's tired.

1389
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,065
Where'll you be?

1390
01:07:03,265 --> 01:07:04,365
I'll be right here.

1391
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:05,899
Got any money
For a cab?

1392
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:07,531
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

1393
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,230
Here. Here.
Take it all.

1394
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:16,029
Thanks. Won't leave you short, will it?

1395
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:20,528
Well, I met her,
Didn't I?

1396
01:07:20,728 --> 01:07:22,060
Who?

1397
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,560
My rival.

1398
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,559
Sure, sure, you met her.

1399
01:07:25,759 --> 01:07:27,992
Don't just "sure" me
Like that, gunner.

1400
01:07:28,192 --> 01:07:30,492
I tell you,
I met my rival,

1401
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:34,491
And she rides with him
When he's alone up there.

1402
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:36,523
Oh.

1403
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:38,523
Yeah.

1404
01:07:38,723 --> 01:07:41,188
And it's hard
To cut out a girl

1405
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:43,355
A man loves
When he's alone.

1406
01:07:43,555 --> 01:07:46,521
He never looked at me the way he looked

1407
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:50,319
When he said he slapped
Her back in her place.

1408
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:54,853
Yeah.

1409
01:07:55,053 --> 01:07:57,152
I met her,
All right.

1410
01:08:09,648 --> 01:08:11,013
Don't worry. I'll stay right with him.

1411
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,214
Gunner?

1412
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:13,380
Hmm?

1413
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,212
Tell him
I want to be slapped.

1414
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:24,377
Back to the same place,
And I ain't sightseeing.

1415
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:30,242
...in your eyes
So blue

1416
01:08:30,442 --> 01:08:36,207
Let me call you
Sweetheart...

1417
01:08:37,206 --> 01:08:38,156
Next bar from here.

1418
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:07,499
Don't shake me.
I'm awake.

1419
01:09:07,699 --> 01:09:09,365
I phoned long enough. You should be.

1420
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:11,198
Yeah. I heard you
The first time.

1421
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:12,731
Why didn't you
Answer it?

1422
01:09:12,931 --> 01:09:15,730
What would I answer it
For? I knew who it was.

1423
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,764
Do you know
What day it is?

1424
01:09:17,964 --> 01:09:20,729
I know it's day and it
Isn't night. That's enough.

1425
01:09:20,929 --> 01:09:22,929
You know
Where you are?

1426
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:25,595
I know
I was in detroit.

1427
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:27,694
Yeah. Now you're
In chicago.

1428
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,194
Chicago?

1429
01:09:29,394 --> 01:09:31,226
Chicago.

1430
01:09:31,426 --> 01:09:35,158
Chicago, chicago

1431
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:37,658
I don't feel
Like doing that.

1432
01:09:37,858 --> 01:09:41,024
You've been in every
City but indianapolis.

1433
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,689
Where is she?

1434
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:48,022
Last time I saw her,
She was in cleveland.

1435
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:49,888
That was 4 days ago.

1436
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,720
Yeah. You don't have
To worry, though.

1437
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,387
I talked to her
On the phone,

1438
01:09:54,587 --> 01:09:56,052
And I had just
Enough dough left

1439
01:09:56,252 --> 01:09:57,719
To wire her back
To new york.

1440
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:58,686
Hmm.

1441
01:09:58,886 --> 01:10:00,218
Yeah, and speaking
Of dough,

1442
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:04,184
I suppose you got my share
Right here with you, huh?

1443
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:06,051
Look in my pants.

1444
01:10:13,415 --> 01:10:15,548
Even the handkerchief
Is blown.

1445
01:10:15,748 --> 01:10:17,381
In the vest.

1446
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,180
There ain't no vest.

1447
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,880
Where is it?

1448
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,879
Ask the vest!

1449
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:28,845
Well, pal,
It was a great race.

1450
01:10:29,045 --> 01:10:30,677
I'm glad you won.

1451
01:10:34,342 --> 01:10:36,176
Time to go home,
Isn't it?

1452
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:38,175
I don't know.
Maybe it is.

1453
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,175
Anyway,
It's an idea.

1454
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:42,174
Yeah.

1455
01:10:42,374 --> 01:10:44,840
And I've got to say
I'm sorry, I suppose.

1456
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,473
And yet if there's any
Fuss, I'm going to be sore.

1457
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:50,172
You know how it is.

1458
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:53,337
No, I don't, but let's
Go home and find out.

1459
01:10:53,537 --> 01:10:57,537
And I hope she still likes
You because she's a good girl.

1460
01:10:57,737 --> 01:11:00,004
She'd make a fine
Wife for somebody.

1461
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,332
We're all right
So far.

1462
01:11:29,695 --> 01:11:31,494
Asleep.

1463
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:34,827
That's better than having
Them awake. You ought to know.

1464
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:42,124
I
- I think I'll go in and see how she is.

1465
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:44,658
Yeah. I think
That'd be fine.

1466
01:11:44,858 --> 01:11:47,157
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll go in.

1467
01:11:47,357 --> 01:11:48,989
Yeah. Go right in.

1468
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:50,790
I'm going.

1469
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:52,656
Yeah.

1470
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,821
What are you
Going to do?

1471
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:00,820
Stay here, where
I can get out quick.

1472
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,319
Wise guy.

1473
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:05,352
You're the fella that
Always takes the chances.

1474
01:12:05,552 --> 01:12:08,150
You ought to
Know that one.

1475
01:12:18,382 --> 01:12:20,648
You want to come
With me?

1476
01:12:20,848 --> 01:12:22,448
No. No, thank you.

1477
01:12:51,673 --> 01:12:53,472
Oh.

1478
01:12:53,672 --> 01:12:55,472
Hello.

1479
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,471
How are you, ann?

1480
01:12:59,471 --> 01:13:02,804
I didn't think
I was asleep.

1481
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:05,803
How are you,
Bad boy?

1482
01:13:06,003 --> 01:13:08,301
Pretty bad boy.

1483
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:10,301
Feeling low?

1484
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:12,801
I've been up higher.

1485
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:14,667
Sure.

1486
01:13:18,533 --> 01:13:20,998
I'm glad
To see you, ann.

1487
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:22,965
I'm glad.

1488
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,964
Is gunner
Out there?

1489
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:26,929
Yeah.

1490
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:29,597
I'll be out
In a minute.

1491
01:13:29,797 --> 01:13:31,262
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1492
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:33,195
Come on out.

1493
01:13:35,294 --> 01:13:36,595
Nothing to it.

1494
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:38,094
What'd she say?

1495
01:13:38,294 --> 01:13:39,527
Nothing.

1496
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:42,726
Hello.

1497
01:13:42,926 --> 01:13:44,459
Howdy.

1498
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,458
You're both
Looking fine.

1499
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:51,457
Well, you know, we've been out before.

1500
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:52,923
Experience helps.

1501
01:13:53,123 --> 01:13:55,423
Say, what have you
Been doing?

1502
01:13:55,623 --> 01:13:59,955
Gee, that's just like him to
Say that like that, isn't it?

1503
01:14:00,155 --> 01:14:02,954
Well, dear, you've had
More fun than I have.

1504
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:05,953
Well, I've tried, if
You put it that way.

1505
01:14:06,153 --> 01:14:07,953
And I've tried
For 5 days

1506
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:11,285
To think of some way
To be cross with you.

1507
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:14,685
Oh, Jim, if I could
Only hate you.

1508
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:16,283
What do you want to hate me for, baby?

1509
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:18,817
Gee, that would be fine.

1510
01:14:19,017 --> 01:14:21,349
And don't sit there
And look so, dear.

1511
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:23,881
He's looking at me
Like he used to,

1512
01:14:24,081 --> 01:14:25,815
Just looking.

1513
01:14:27,181 --> 01:14:28,814
Look at gunner.

1514
01:14:30,547 --> 01:14:32,079
Hey!

1515
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:33,747
There it is.

1516
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:37,812
You see what I mean,
Gunner? When he just looks?

1517
01:14:39,411 --> 01:14:43,744
That's why I married him,
So it must be some look.

1518
01:14:43,944 --> 01:14:47,109
It's so stern and so sweet
And so dumb.

1519
01:14:47,309 --> 01:14:50,274
It's halfway between
An indian and a gazelle,

1520
01:14:50,474 --> 01:14:53,308
And I can't do anything
Against it.

1521
01:14:53,508 --> 01:14:56,741
Oh, won't the landlady
Be glad to see you, too?

1522
01:14:56,941 --> 01:14:58,272
Hmm?

1523
01:14:58,472 --> 01:14:59,773
How she likes you.

1524
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:01,271
She likes me?

1525
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:03,405
Does she.
She kept asking me,

1526
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:06,604
"when in the world
Will Mr. Lane be home?"

1527
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:08,104
She's
A fine woman.

1528
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:11,103
Say, how much do we owe her, darling?

1529
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:12,602
About $200, darling.

1530
01:15:12,802 --> 01:15:15,102
Oh, well, that's nothing, is it?

1531
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:20,567
No, but I'll bet you haven't got
All of that 10,000 left, have you?

1532
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:23,166
I'll bet-let's see.
5 days...

1533
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:26,199
Gee whiz,
The way you spend it,

1534
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:28,732
I'll bet you haven't
Got over-

1535
01:15:28,932 --> 01:15:32,163
Over 6,000 or 7,000 left,
Have you?

1536
01:15:33,463 --> 01:15:35,296
Not over that,
Dear.

1537
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:38,629
Well, it's a lot more
Than $10, isn't it?

1538
01:15:38,829 --> 01:15:41,428
Remember the night
We only had $10, darling?

1539
01:15:41,628 --> 01:15:42,960
Boy!

1540
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,293
Uh, gunner tells me
You got home all right.

1541
01:15:46,493 --> 01:15:48,793
Yes. Here I am.
I'm home.

1542
01:15:48,993 --> 01:15:51,826
Yeah.
That's right.

1543
01:15:52,026 --> 01:15:54,324
Kind of a lonesome trip, though...

1544
01:15:54,524 --> 01:15:56,224
Probably.

1545
01:15:58,123 --> 01:15:59,990
Better than
Mrs. Benson's.

1546
01:16:03,789 --> 01:16:05,288
Yeah.

1547
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,387
I'm sorry, ann.
I'm broke.

1548
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:14,252
I'm asking for your
Hand. I want to shake it.

1549
01:16:14,452 --> 01:16:16,418
I know you're broke.
I was only teasing.

1550
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:18,418
But I know Mrs. Benson
Isn't broke.

1551
01:16:18,618 --> 01:16:20,417
That was lovely
Of you, pal.

1552
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,784
I'll bet you were funny when
You were giving it to her.

1553
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:26,717
I wish I'd been
Behind the screen.

1554
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,215
Hey!

1555
01:16:28,415 --> 01:16:29,215
What?

1556
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:30,749
You're some girl!

1557
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:31,715
Oh!

1558
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:33,247
I see. I see now.

1559
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:34,748
You do? What?

1560
01:16:34,948 --> 01:16:36,747
I see what you are.
You're all right.

1561
01:16:36,947 --> 01:16:38,747
And listen, you know
What I'm going to do?

1562
01:16:38,947 --> 01:16:40,546
I'm going to do something
That'll surprise you.

1563
01:16:40,746 --> 01:16:42,745
I'm going to show you
What I think of you.

1564
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,745
I'm going out and grab
Some wine and drink to you.

1565
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:46,244
What a surprise!

1566
01:16:46,444 --> 01:16:48,243
Don't kid yourself. Any dame
That accepts things like that

1567
01:16:48,443 --> 01:16:50,210
Isn't a dame.
She's something else.

1568
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:53,242
Is that joint open on the corner?
Never mind. I'll break in if it isn't.

1569
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,608
I'll be back with the bacon.
I'm drinking to a woman.

1570
01:16:55,808 --> 01:16:58,541
I'm drinking to your mother,
I'm drinking to your father,

1571
01:16:58,741 --> 01:17:01,440
And I'm drinking to the whole
Cornfed state of kansas.

1572
01:17:05,772 --> 01:17:07,405
I've been around him
A long time.

1573
01:17:07,605 --> 01:17:10,904
That's the first time I ever heard
Him praise anything but himself.

1574
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:12,404
I can't believe it.

1575
01:17:12,604 --> 01:17:15,403
But you've got it coming.
It was fine.

1576
01:17:15,603 --> 01:17:19,902
Why? What else do you do
When there's nothing to do?

1577
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:23,201
It's easy to be gallant
When you're doomed.

1578
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,667
What do you mean,
Doomed?

1579
01:17:27,867 --> 01:17:29,166
You should
Ask me that.

1580
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:31,931
Who said I was a sucker
When he was on fire?

1581
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:33,931
I've had 5 days
To think, haven't I?

1582
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:36,097
Don't you think I know
He has to get drunk?

1583
01:17:36,297 --> 01:17:38,297
Don't you think I can think with you?

1584
01:17:38,497 --> 01:17:41,096
And don't you think, Mr.
Gunner, I've tried to walk out?

1585
01:17:41,296 --> 01:17:43,062
I've got a ticket in
My pocketbook, even.

1586
01:17:43,262 --> 01:17:46,762
I've packed my bag so
Many times it's worn out,

1587
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:48,428
But I didn't go,

1588
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:50,627
And now I'm going
To be drunk to.

1589
01:17:50,827 --> 01:17:53,527
But, ann, you shouldn't
Think like that,

1590
01:17:53,727 --> 01:17:56,793
Because
- because it's no way to think. It's crazy.

1591
01:17:56,993 --> 01:17:58,258
Well,
This is crazier.

1592
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:02,190
3 roads face us, and there's
Doom at the end of each.

1593
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,657
Suppose
He didn't drink,

1594
01:18:03,857 --> 01:18:05,357
He slapped her
Back again,

1595
01:18:05,557 --> 01:18:08,423
And he sits around, his
Nerves screaming with triumph.

1596
01:18:08,623 --> 01:18:09,921
He sits around

1597
01:18:10,121 --> 01:18:12,055
Drinking sarsaparilla with ann-me.

1598
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:14,053
How he would
Love me.

1599
01:18:15,254 --> 01:18:17,553
The second road
Is worse than that.

1600
01:18:17,753 --> 01:18:20,053
He's retired from flying
And works on the ground.

1601
01:18:20,253 --> 01:18:22,519
Imagine a man with
His heart in the sky

1602
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,084
Living with a woman
On the ground.

1603
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,384
He wouldn't like
Himself very much,

1604
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:30,216
And I wouldn't like him, either, gunner.

1605
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:34,015
Oh, no. He's in love
With a woman with wings.

1606
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:37,947
She's got him. I've
No way to cut her out.

1607
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:39,315
But there's
Another road.

1608
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:42,113
Yes, there is,
And we're on it.

1609
01:18:42,313 --> 01:18:44,979
We go on as if nothing had happened.

1610
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,645
He goes in the next race, another bat,

1611
01:18:47,845 --> 01:18:50,445
Another race,
Another bat,

1612
01:18:50,645 --> 01:18:54,044
Until someday, when he's
Not quite so young and quick,

1613
01:18:54,244 --> 01:18:56,076
She slaps him out,

1614
01:18:56,276 --> 01:19:00,141
And Mrs. Benson takes
Another man home on the train.

1615
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:03,508
How do you like it?

1616
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,074
You know, don't you?

1617
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:09,040
No, no, I don't know. I've
Only had it for 10 years,

1618
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,739
And you hit it right
On the nose, too.

1619
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:14,238
You just sit
And wait for it.

1620
01:19:15,438 --> 01:19:17,004
What do I do it for?

1621
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:20,337
Because there's nothing
Else to do. He gets you.

1622
01:19:20,537 --> 01:19:23,536
There's no fun being
With anybody else.

1623
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:28,368
What's fun about waiting
For somebody to die?

1624
01:19:28,568 --> 01:19:31,034
Every ticktock
Of the clock-

1625
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:33,366
Still living,
Still living,

1626
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:36,033
Still living,
Still living.

1627
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:38,766
What for?
I won't do it.

1628
01:19:38,966 --> 01:19:41,564
I won't love him
That much.

1629
01:19:41,764 --> 01:19:43,664
What do you think
I'm made of?

1630
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:45,863
How can you expect
Me to do that?

1631
01:19:46,063 --> 01:19:47,795
You didn't say
I was a sucker.

1632
01:19:47,995 --> 01:19:49,663
You said I was the champion of them.

1633
01:19:49,863 --> 01:19:51,561
Well, I won't be.

1634
01:19:52,928 --> 01:19:55,727
Haven't I the right
To live my life

1635
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:57,727
Without being tortured every second?

1636
01:19:57,927 --> 01:19:59,259
Haven't I?

1637
01:19:59,459 --> 01:20:01,226
Haven't I?!

1638
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,557
What's the matter?

1639
01:20:09,757 --> 01:20:11,889
I'm leaving you, that's what
It is, on the next train.

1640
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:13,390
You'll never
See me again.

1641
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,855
Don't blow on me, ann.
Right now.

1642
01:20:15,055 --> 01:20:17,489
Give me a chance to make
Up for this, will you? No.

1643
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:20,054
Come on. Give me a chance. I'm
Not used to being married yet.

1644
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:21,087
No.

1645
01:20:21,287 --> 01:20:22,553
But I'll pick up.
I never asked anybody

1646
01:20:22,753 --> 01:20:24,086
To do anything
For me before.

1647
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,552
That's a good start,
Isn't it, ann?

1648
01:20:25,752 --> 01:20:27,052
I won't do it.

1649
01:20:27,252 --> 01:20:30,018
I've been looking forward to
Seeing you all day. Ask the gunner.

1650
01:20:30,218 --> 01:20:31,518
I don't care.

1651
01:20:31,718 --> 01:20:34,517
And listen, dear, I'm going to
Prove a lot of things to you.

1652
01:20:34,717 --> 01:20:36,516
We started on that
Last party together.

1653
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:38,650
I can see your face
Before me right now,

1654
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,649
Sitting there
Through all that smoke.

1655
01:20:40,849 --> 01:20:42,682
We were even flirting,
Weren't we? Sure we were.

1656
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:44,714
That party is going to
End up with you.

1657
01:20:44,914 --> 01:20:46,714
You go in the kitchen
And make some sandwiches,

1658
01:20:46,914 --> 01:20:49,513
And we'll make believe there
Were no 5 days in between.

1659
01:20:49,713 --> 01:20:51,545
Just you and I
On a little blowoff.

1660
01:20:51,745 --> 01:20:53,245
See the idea of it, ann?

1661
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:54,746
Please see.

1662
01:20:54,946 --> 01:20:56,611
No.

1663
01:21:00,477 --> 01:21:02,610
Take it easy, pal.

1664
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:09,742
It's all right. You
Can't blame her, I guess.

1665
01:21:09,942 --> 01:21:11,741
All that talk of sweden
And all that.

1666
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:13,741
You know those things
Are disappointing.

1667
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,239
And she tried hard
To forgive me, didn't she?

1668
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,739
I wish she hadn't made me
Believe it, though.

1669
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:22,237
She was kind of sweet the
Way she talked at first.

1670
01:21:22,437 --> 01:21:23,738
Well, that's all right.

1671
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:25,737
A lot of angles
To it, boy.

1672
01:21:25,937 --> 01:21:27,670
Yeah? There's just
One angle to it, boy-

1673
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,702
She doesn't love me as much
As I thought she did.

1674
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:33,067
That's the ticket when
You get right down to it,

1675
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:35,167
And there's nothing
You can do about that.

1676
01:21:35,367 --> 01:21:37,200
Yeah, and that's
All right, too.

1677
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,700
Oh, I don't know.

1678
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,699
Yeah? Well,
She fooled me good.

1679
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:43,833
I thought I rated higher
Than a few days drunk.

1680
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:47,831
I'm sorry I asked her
To stay now,

1681
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:50,830
Because I did ask her. You
Were in the room. You heard me.

1682
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,829
I actually asked her
To stay.

1683
01:21:53,029 --> 01:21:55,329
I did something I never
Did before in my life-

1684
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:57,794
I begged a girl
To be my girl. Hmm!

1685
01:21:57,994 --> 01:22:00,628
And I didn't beg her once.
I begged her twice.

1686
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:03,426
Me! A little country girl
Off of a kansas farm,

1687
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:05,026
And I begged her.

1688
01:22:05,226 --> 01:22:08,425
I ought to go in there
And tell her right now!

1689
01:22:11,724 --> 01:22:13,224
I'm packed.

1690
01:22:13,424 --> 01:22:15,956
See all my things?

1691
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:21,855
You just happened
To come back

1692
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:23,355
At the wrong
Moment, dear.

1693
01:22:23,555 --> 01:22:26,354
I was telling gunner how
Lonesome I was, that's all.

1694
01:22:26,554 --> 01:22:27,820
After this,
I'll understand.

1695
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,286
Your life is yours, and the
Loudest applause you'll hear of all

1696
01:22:31,486 --> 01:22:33,252
Will be me in the stands.

1697
01:22:33,452 --> 01:22:36,652
So, do you still want me
To come to the party?

1698
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:39,184
I'll make a cheese sandwich if you do.

1699
01:22:39,384 --> 01:22:41,283
I do that very well.

1700
01:22:43,016 --> 01:22:45,048
Gee, I'm glad
To see you, crazy.

1701
01:22:45,248 --> 01:22:47,415
Did you really see my
Face through the smoke?

1702
01:22:47,615 --> 01:22:52,413
How's your sky girl? Have you
Slapped her since I've seen you?

1703
01:22:52,613 --> 01:22:53,913
Yes, dear.

1704
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:57,379
I know you don't want me
To get out of here now.

1705
01:22:57,579 --> 01:22:58,778
There's that funny look coming over

1706
01:22:58,978 --> 01:23:00,345
Your funny mug
Again.

1707
01:23:00,545 --> 01:23:01,844
See it, gunner?

1708
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:05,377
I don't see why that's
Funnier than any other.

1709
01:23:05,577 --> 01:23:08,209
See? Gunner thinks
You're funny, too.

1710
01:23:09,509 --> 01:23:11,342
You're a big clown,
Baby.

1711
01:23:11,542 --> 01:23:15,374
No other face ever made me
Laugh so much before.

1712
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,374
And she calls me crazy. I ask you.

1713
01:23:18,574 --> 01:23:21,240
Listen, nuts, I'm going to
Do more than look at you.

1714
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,871
I'm going to
Settle down.

1715
01:23:23,071 --> 01:23:25,838
Yeah. I'm going to surprise
You. I'm going to settle down.

1716
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:27,471
How, dear?
Settle how?

1717
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:28,971
Just the way you want it. Jim.

1718
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,637
I'm going to get
That dough back

1719
01:23:30,837 --> 01:23:32,470
So fast you won't know
What hit you.

1720
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,502
Drake's got jobs that
No one wants any part of,

1721
01:23:34,702 --> 01:23:36,169
All the way from pursuit
Jobs to seaplanes.

1722
01:23:36,369 --> 01:23:39,168
That-a boy. That's a cute
Little place to settle down.

1723
01:23:39,368 --> 01:23:40,435
What do you
Mean, pal?

1724
01:23:40,635 --> 01:23:42,133
I mean, right in the middle
Of the atlantic ocean.

1725
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,667
Oh. Say, who do you love, kansas?

1726
01:23:44,867 --> 01:23:47,132
You, so help me, the whole ocean full.

1727
01:23:47,332 --> 01:23:48,665
I'm so crazy
About you.

1728
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:50,665
Yes. I'm nuts.
I must be.

1729
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:52,465
Ha ha ha!

1730
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:54,897
I wish you could have
Seen Drake's face

1731
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:56,363
When I told him I was settling
Down. He thought I was drunk.

1732
01:23:56,563 --> 01:23:57,896
You're not fooling
Anybody.

1733
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:00,395
Wrap it tight, pal. I'm going to
Give it the works up there today,

1734
01:24:00,595 --> 01:24:01,828
And I don't want it
To pop open.

1735
01:24:02,028 --> 01:24:03,395
I'll wrap them.
You fly them.

1736
01:24:03,595 --> 01:24:06,394
What's eating on you? You think
I'm going to get drunk tonight, too?

1737
01:24:06,594 --> 01:24:07,393
You think so?

1738
01:24:07,593 --> 01:24:08,393
I didn't say that.

1739
01:24:08,593 --> 01:24:09,893
No. You didn't say
Anything.

1740
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:11,892
Listen, I meant every word
I told her last night.

1741
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:13,392
From now on, I'm going to
Attend to business.

1742
01:24:13,592 --> 01:24:15,391
I used to take jobs
When I felt like it,

1743
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:17,724
But from now on, I'm going to
Take anything that comes along,

1744
01:24:17,924 --> 01:24:20,424
And all the dough
- I'm going to put it right in her lap.

1745
01:24:20,624 --> 01:24:21,923
Will that
Please her! Baby!

1746
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,423
Do you really want
To please her?

1747
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:24,423
Just watch me.

1748
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:26,355
Quit flying and go
Into a shoe store.

1749
01:24:26,555 --> 01:24:27,589
Did she tell you that?

1750
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:28,821
I'm just
Saying that.

1751
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:30,853
Yeah, and you're just
Saying nothing, as usual.

1752
01:24:31,053 --> 01:24:32,853
That just shows you
What you know about women.

1753
01:24:33,053 --> 01:24:35,353
A shoe store! I should give up
The trade I love for a woman.

1754
01:24:35,553 --> 01:24:37,220
She'd hate me.
You heard what she said-

1755
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,352
She'd be the loudest
Applause of all.

1756
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,318
Why don't you go
Drown yourself?

1757
01:24:41,518 --> 01:24:42,657
Is that
Tight enough?

1758
01:24:42,857 --> 01:24:44,850
Yeah, but I'm not
Going to be tonight.

1759
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,849
I'm going to take her
To a show instead.

1760
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,317
And who do you love,
Honey?

1761
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:49,882
I love you.

1762
01:24:50,082 --> 01:24:51,382
Yeah,
And I love you, too.

1763
01:24:51,582 --> 01:24:52,881
Come on.
Cut it out!

1764
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:54,381
Sweetheart,
You didn't kiss me.

1765
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:55,881
Come on. Let's go
And kiss the army.

1766
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:57,280
Yeah. All right.

1767
01:25:05,978 --> 01:25:07,212
Well! He's
Getting even

1768
01:25:07,412 --> 01:25:08,743
To look like
A gentleman,

1769
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:10,211
Isn't he,
Gunner?

1770
01:25:10,411 --> 01:25:12,243
He's got that settled-down look.

1771
01:25:12,443 --> 01:25:13,709
Do you play
Bridge, Jim?

1772
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:15,242
It's an idea.
I'll learn.

1773
01:25:15,442 --> 01:25:17,708
Ah, come to the house any evening.

1774
01:25:17,908 --> 01:25:18,708
Glad to.

1775
01:25:18,908 --> 01:25:20,241
Will you come
To dinner?

1776
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:21,241
Fine.

1777
01:25:21,441 --> 01:25:22,773
White tie?

1778
01:25:22,973 --> 01:25:23,773
Right.

1779
01:25:23,973 --> 01:25:25,573
White tie!

1780
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,438
Ah, general!

1781
01:25:30,638 --> 01:25:33,438
Well, you knew I'd make it somehow, huh?

1782
01:25:33,638 --> 01:25:35,437
Well, I had the idea.

1783
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:37,437
Well, well, well,
Well, well!

1784
01:25:37,637 --> 01:25:38,936
Hello, general.

1785
01:25:39,136 --> 01:25:40,902
I haven't seen you
Since you left the army.

1786
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:41,901
How are they doing?

1787
01:25:42,101 --> 01:25:43,035
I might forget
A lot of things

1788
01:25:43,235 --> 01:25:44,235
If you want
To come back.

1789
01:25:44,435 --> 01:25:45,401
I've still got
Insomnia.

1790
01:25:45,601 --> 01:25:46,401
Ha ha ha!

1791
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:47,900
Oh, Lane.
Yeah?

1792
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,899
Drake has probably told
You everything but this-

1793
01:25:50,099 --> 01:25:53,399
This test is more important to
The army than it is to Drake.

1794
01:25:53,599 --> 01:25:57,398
Drake will sell a lot of ships
If you win. That lets him out.

1795
01:25:57,598 --> 01:26:00,930
But the army needs a new pursuit
Speed. We've got to have it.

1796
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:02,430
Who are you chasing,
General?

1797
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:03,896
Wait'll you see
What we've got.

1798
01:26:04,096 --> 01:26:05,929
It's a shame to bust up
A pretty bird like this,

1799
01:26:06,129 --> 01:26:07,429
But you've got to
Do it for us.

1800
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:08,928
We must find out
What that speed is.

1801
01:26:09,128 --> 01:26:10,428
She'll move,
General.

1802
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:13,927
I hope so. I saw billy hogan
Bringing the other one down.

1803
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,434
She wasn't loafing,
Either,

1804
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:17,266
But hogan wasn't alive
To tell us.

1805
01:26:17,466 --> 01:26:19,425
I shouldn't be telling
You this, I suppose.

1806
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,458
Why general, you're giving me
The jitters.

1807
01:26:21,658 --> 01:26:23,591
What do you expect of
Those army aviators?

1808
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:26,257
Anyway, I'll kiss the
Wings good-bye at 3,000

1809
01:26:26,457 --> 01:26:28,856
And have all the dough
For you, ok, general?

1810
01:26:29,056 --> 01:26:30,390
Come out alive, boy.

1811
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,689
Yeah. Sure.
You should see her.

1812
01:27:03,147 --> 01:27:04,247
Thank you.

1813
01:27:27,374 --> 01:27:29,973
Thought you were
Going to stay home.

1814
01:27:30,173 --> 01:27:32,839
That's worse.
I'd rather see it, even.

1815
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:34,804
Do they go that high
Always?

1816
01:27:35,004 --> 01:27:38,671
That's the idea of it.
They got to get a start.

1817
01:27:40,404 --> 01:27:43,702
How bad is it?
As bad as I gathered?

1818
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:45,702
Remember,
We don't act.

1819
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:47,668
I don't know, ann.

1820
01:27:47,868 --> 01:27:50,534
That's right.
Don't kid me.

1821
01:28:03,598 --> 01:28:05,997
Here he comes!

1822
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:09,962
I wish he were home. No, I
Don't, either. Come on, Jim!

1823
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:21,444
Wouldn't it be funny
If it rained?

1824
01:29:21,644 --> 01:29:24,409
If it rained now,
We'd all get wet,

1825
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:27,176
And he's got
An umbrella.

1826
01:29:43,738 --> 01:29:44,538
Thanks.

1827
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:45,871
You ok?

1828
01:29:46,071 --> 01:29:48,170
Yes, yes.
Go on home.

1829
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:51,902
You all right, Jim?

1830
01:29:52,102 --> 01:29:53,869
Yeah, sure.

1831
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:55,901
Ok, read it
Yourself.

1832
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:57,401
9.6.

1833
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:00,733
Yeah. Wait till you see the
Whites of their eyes, gentlemen.

1834
01:30:00,933 --> 01:30:02,533
Ha ha ha!

1835
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:05,366
Come on. Take
A little more.

1836
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:06,865
Good. That's fine.

1837
01:30:07,065 --> 01:30:08,365
He's all right.

1838
01:30:08,565 --> 01:30:09,897
You mean it?

1839
01:30:10,097 --> 01:30:11,064
Yeah, yeah.

1840
01:30:11,264 --> 01:30:12,564
Don't tell him.

1841
01:30:12,764 --> 01:30:14,029
I won't, pal.

1842
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:15,063
Thanks.

1843
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:16,363
I'll go find him.

1844
01:30:16,563 --> 01:30:18,028
All right, pal.

1845
01:30:21,594 --> 01:30:23,061
Well, well! What are you doing here?

1846
01:30:23,261 --> 01:30:24,759
I was a little
Thirsty, wasn't I?

1847
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:26,427
You should have
Seen her, Mr. Lane.

1848
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:28,359
He's seen me before. How
About joining me, Mr. Lane?

1849
01:30:28,559 --> 01:30:30,359
Don't tell me you're buying
A drink, Mrs. Lane. Scotch.

1850
01:30:30,559 --> 01:30:32,024
What do you do
For dough?

1851
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,858
Twice. My credit
Is far-reaching.

1852
01:30:34,058 --> 01:30:36,691
Yeah? Then how about
Reaching for that, pal?

1853
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:38,656
Ooh. $4,000.

1854
01:30:38,856 --> 01:30:39,822
How's that?

1855
01:30:40,022 --> 01:30:41,022
Oh, well.

1856
01:30:41,222 --> 01:30:42,689
Well, look again.
It isn't mine.

1857
01:30:42,889 --> 01:30:44,188
It's made out to me.

1858
01:30:44,388 --> 01:30:46,188
Yeah, and there's a lot more
Coming in that same parade.

1859
01:30:46,388 --> 01:30:48,154
Didn't I tell you things
Were going to be different?

1860
01:30:48,354 --> 01:30:50,020
And you know what I'm
Going to do tonight?

1861
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,686
I'm going to take
You to a show,

1862
01:30:51,886 --> 01:30:53,320
And then I'm going
Home like a gentleman-

1863
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,185
I mean, like a husband. What do I mean?

1864
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:56,852
The whole idea's
Got me groggy.

1865
01:30:57,052 --> 01:30:59,384
Me, too, but I'm not going to
Be any more groggier about you.

1866
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,218
I don't care
How sweet you are.huh?

1867
01:31:01,418 --> 01:31:03,217
I'm stuck on you enough,
And that's enough, see?

1868
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:04,716
Stuck on me, huh?

1869
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:07,382
Yes, I'm stuck on you. And
Now I'm going to drink to you.

1870
01:31:07,582 --> 01:31:09,349
Here's to your mother,
Here's to your father,

1871
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:12,714
And here's to the best aviator
In the entire cockeyed world.

1872
01:31:12,914 --> 01:31:14,547
Ha ha ha!

1873
01:31:54,037 --> 01:31:56,836
Still living...
Still living... Still living...

1874
01:31:57,036 --> 01:31:58,934
Still living...
Still living.

1875
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:19,863
I hope you all know
Who you're riding with!

1876
01:32:20,063 --> 01:32:22,362
Woo! Ha ha!

1877
01:32:22,562 --> 01:32:24,629
I'm not kidding!

1878
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:29,294
I want you to meet
The greatest test pilot

1879
01:32:29,494 --> 01:32:31,727
In the history
Of the world!

1880
01:32:33,326 --> 01:32:35,293
Trouble, brother?
You look mournful.

1881
01:32:35,493 --> 01:32:37,825
Afraid your friends
Will fall out?

1882
01:32:38,025 --> 01:32:40,124
It's another road
At that.

1883
01:32:40,324 --> 01:32:42,657
No, they won't be
That lucky.

1884
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:44,789
Oh, look
At this one!

1885
01:32:48,489 --> 01:32:49,955
Ah!

1886
01:32:53,521 --> 01:32:54,620
Oh, boy!

1887
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,287
Yes, ma'am?

1888
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:59,819
Please don't go so fast. Mr. Lane
Has a little trouble with his heart,

1889
01:33:00,019 --> 01:33:02,818
And any speed... Well,
You know what I mean.

1890
01:33:03,018 --> 01:33:04,818
Yes, ma'am. I'll take it nice and slow.

1891
01:33:05,018 --> 01:33:06,651
Ha ha ha!

1892
01:33:08,183 --> 01:33:11,683
Oh, it's wonderful
To be silly, I guess.

1893
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:15,848
Oh, I want
Some peanuts.

1894
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:17,182
Peanuts? Yeah.

1895
01:33:17,382 --> 01:33:19,014
Oh, be careful,
Darling.

1896
01:33:19,214 --> 01:33:20,347
You can't keep
This up.

1897
01:33:20,547 --> 01:33:21,480
What's the matter?

1898
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:22,846
I've never felt
Such pain.

1899
01:33:23,046 --> 01:33:24,346
It's like the sharp edge of a knife.

1900
01:33:24,546 --> 01:33:25,845
I'll get used
To it, really.

1901
01:33:26,045 --> 01:33:27,279
You'll be dead
Before he is.

1902
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:28,611
That's
All right, too.

1903
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:29,944
All right.

1904
01:33:30,144 --> 01:33:32,776
I'm sorry. I'll get used
To it in time. Give me time.

1905
01:33:32,976 --> 01:33:36,243
I don't mean that either. I'm grabbing
What I can. What do you want me to do?

1906
01:33:36,443 --> 01:33:37,775
I don't know.

1907
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:39,742
Gunner, don't
Ever fall in love.

1908
01:33:39,942 --> 01:33:41,542
Don't ever
Fall in love.

1909
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:43,275
You know what goes
Good with peanuts?

1910
01:33:43,475 --> 01:33:44,441
What, outside
Of you?

1911
01:33:44,641 --> 01:33:45,441
Champagne.

1912
01:33:45,641 --> 01:33:46,973
Yeah? Try
And get it.

1913
01:33:47,173 --> 01:33:48,972
That's easy. There's a good
Hotel right up here-the neptune.

1914
01:33:49,172 --> 01:33:50,139
The neptune?

1915
01:33:50,339 --> 01:33:51,306
The neptune.

1916
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:52,805
Yes, sir.

1917
01:33:53,005 --> 01:33:54,472
Having a good
Time, darling?

1918
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:55,637
Precious.

1919
01:33:55,837 --> 01:33:57,137
Enjoying yourself,
Gunner?

1920
01:33:57,337 --> 01:33:58,504
Adorable.

1921
01:33:58,704 --> 01:34:01,803
Why don't you be gay for once
And give yourself a shock?

1922
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,302
Too many roads.

1923
01:34:03,502 --> 01:34:04,469
What roads?

1924
01:34:04,669 --> 01:34:05,436
3 roads.

1925
01:34:05,636 --> 01:34:06,436
Gunner-

1926
01:34:06,636 --> 01:34:07,934
Yeah, 3 roads.

1927
01:34:08,134 --> 01:34:09,468
3 roads.
3 roads.

1928
01:34:09,668 --> 01:34:10,633
Yeah.
Yeah.

1929
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:12,100
This is driving
Me crazy.

1930
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,800
The 3 roads? Yeah, the 3 roads,

1931
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,466
And I don't know
What I'm doing.

1932
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:16,665
You're going
Crazy.

1933
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:18,298
Yeah, I guess
Maybe I am.

1934
01:34:20,498 --> 01:34:21,830
Gunner.

1935
01:34:23,364 --> 01:34:25,297
I'm sorry to see you
Do that, pal.

1936
01:34:25,497 --> 01:34:27,762
You're going to be sorry
For a lot more than that,

1937
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,761
But you got company.
There's 3 of us,

1938
01:34:29,961 --> 01:34:31,761
And we're all doomed.
That's a road apiece.

1939
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:33,760
And miss up there-
She lives on.

1940
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,727
What are you
Talking about?

1941
01:34:35,927 --> 01:34:37,726
You're drunk already.

1942
01:34:37,926 --> 01:34:40,226
I haven't said
A word.

1943
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:42,225
Here, have a drink.

1944
01:34:46,491 --> 01:34:47,425
Where are we?

1945
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:49,590
We're going through
Brooklyn, dear.

1946
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,789
Jim.

1947
01:34:51,989 --> 01:34:52,755
What?

1948
01:34:52,955 --> 01:34:54,289
Going through
Brooklyn.

1949
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:56,255
I can't help it.

1950
01:34:56,455 --> 01:34:58,288
Brooklyn
Or anything else.

1951
01:34:58,488 --> 01:35:00,454
You're helpless.

1952
01:35:01,287 --> 01:35:02,586
3 roads.

1953
01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:04,119
He's on them
Again.

1954
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:05,286
What, dear?

1955
01:35:05,486 --> 01:35:06,786
3 roads.

1956
01:35:06,986 --> 01:35:08,285
Oh.

1957
01:35:08,485 --> 01:35:09,951
Make him
Take this.

1958
01:35:10,151 --> 01:35:11,451
I'll take them,

1959
01:35:11,651 --> 01:35:13,750
All 3 of them.

1960
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,783
3 blind roads.

1961
01:35:15,983 --> 01:35:17,783
See how they run.

1962
01:35:17,983 --> 01:35:19,249
Where are we?

1963
01:35:19,449 --> 01:35:20,782
In brooklyn still?

1964
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:22,747
You're on
The roads, boy.

1965
01:35:22,947 --> 01:35:24,314
It won't be long.

1966
01:35:24,514 --> 01:35:27,247
Ann.

1967
01:35:27,447 --> 01:35:28,713
Oh, ann.

1968
01:35:28,913 --> 01:35:30,246
I'm right here,
Dear.

1969
01:35:30,446 --> 01:35:31,712
Where's Jim?

1970
01:35:31,912 --> 01:35:33,245
He's right here,
Too.

1971
01:35:33,445 --> 01:35:34,744
Two? You're crazy.

1972
01:35:34,944 --> 01:35:36,577
There's 3.

1973
01:35:36,777 --> 01:35:39,244
3 roads...

1974
01:35:39,444 --> 01:35:41,243
3 blind roads.

1975
01:36:34,928 --> 01:36:36,396
How much heavier
You figure

1976
01:36:36,596 --> 01:36:38,228
These new bombs are
Going to run, general?

1977
01:36:38,428 --> 01:36:39,727
3 or 4 tons.

1978
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:42,193
That's enough. Have you met Lane's wife?

1979
01:36:42,393 --> 01:36:43,726
No.

1980
01:36:43,926 --> 01:36:45,725
They don't come
Any sweeter.

1981
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,226
Thursday!
Hello!

1982
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:48,691
Oh, hello.

1983
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:50,724
Come over here.

1984
01:36:50,924 --> 01:36:53,224
General ross, this is thursday Lane.

1985
01:36:53,424 --> 01:36:54,391
Hello, thursday.

1986
01:36:54,591 --> 01:36:55,556
Hello, general.

1987
01:36:55,756 --> 01:36:57,023
Get in there.

1988
01:36:57,223 --> 01:36:58,223
Thank you.

1989
01:36:58,423 --> 01:36:59,722
Come here.
Well...

1990
01:36:59,922 --> 01:37:02,688
What's the name
Of the hotel, general?

1991
01:37:02,888 --> 01:37:04,187
Isn't she a buster?

1992
01:37:04,387 --> 01:37:07,254
This is going to be the
Biggest job Jim's ever done,

1993
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:08,753
In every way,
Thursday.

1994
01:37:08,953 --> 01:37:11,219
You see all that loading
They're doing?

1995
01:37:11,419 --> 01:37:14,252
That represents the weight
Of the bombs and the crew.

1996
01:37:14,452 --> 01:37:18,218
The height record for a war boat of
That size is just under 20,000 feet.

1997
01:37:18,418 --> 01:37:21,217
We're after 30 with
A range of 5,000 miles.

1998
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:22,749
30,000?

1999
01:37:22,949 --> 01:37:25,249
Ha ha! That's way up, thursday.

2000
01:37:25,449 --> 01:37:26,647
6 miles?

2001
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:27,981
Mm-hmm.

2002
01:37:28,181 --> 01:37:29,348
Hi, darling!

2003
01:37:29,548 --> 01:37:31,847
I hear you're going to have
Lunch with a bunch of angels.

2004
01:37:32,047 --> 01:37:33,347
Are you jealous?

2005
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:34,846
Speak for yourself.

2006
01:37:35,046 --> 01:37:36,645
She's going to have
Lunch with the general.

2007
01:37:36,845 --> 01:37:38,845
Where did you ever find
Anything like this, Lane?

2008
01:37:39,045 --> 01:37:41,178
I picked it off
A cloud, general.

2009
01:37:41,378 --> 01:37:43,710
I haven't seen
A cloud for so long.

2010
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:47,210
Darling, I'd love to take
That high ride with you.

2011
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:51,209
I've never asked you before. Can I
Be a bomb? I'll be twice as quiet.

2012
01:37:51,409 --> 01:37:54,008
You know what you'd be
With that dress on up there?

2013
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:55,540
What would I be?

2014
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,007
A little icicle.

2015
01:37:57,207 --> 01:37:58,307
With you?

2016
01:37:58,507 --> 01:38:00,040
When do you take off? Right away.

2017
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:03,072
Give me 28,000, we'll call it a day.

2018
01:38:03,272 --> 01:38:04,071
Right, general?

2019
01:38:04,271 --> 01:38:05,472
Certainly.

2020
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,537
But don't force her, man.
You've got a hotel on your hand.

2021
01:38:07,737 --> 01:38:10,371
What will you give me for everything
I get over 30? I feel in form.

2022
01:38:10,571 --> 01:38:13,236
You just get
30 and stop feeling.

2023
01:38:13,436 --> 01:38:15,501
Those are orders.
Right, general?

2024
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:17,501
Right.
She'll bust over 30.

2025
01:38:17,701 --> 01:38:19,500
You stop fooling
And come home.

2026
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,567
Yeah. Think of us waiting down here.

2027
01:38:21,767 --> 01:38:23,532
Yes. Think
Of your wife.

2028
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:26,898
Yeah, yeah. I always think of thursday.

2029
01:38:29,265 --> 01:38:31,064
Come on. Get going. We
Want to get out of here.

2030
01:38:31,264 --> 01:38:32,731
Take your time,
Gunner. We're ready.

2031
01:38:32,931 --> 01:38:34,397
Yeah? You've been
Ready all day.

2032
01:38:34,597 --> 01:38:36,297
Listen, you do
The flying, and-

2033
01:38:38,695 --> 01:38:40,229
Here, here. What's
The matter here?

2034
01:38:40,429 --> 01:38:41,728
Tell that guy-

2035
01:38:41,928 --> 01:38:43,562
I'll tell you.

2036
01:38:45,562 --> 01:38:48,560
What's the matter with you? You're not the
Guy I know anymore-drinking and fighting.

2037
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,592
Yeah, and I'll tell you why, and
You're going to listen and like it.

2038
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,525
Then maybe you'll see...

2039
01:38:55,392 --> 01:38:57,257
What will I see?

2040
01:38:57,457 --> 01:39:00,257
You must be drunk.
I never heard such talk.

2041
01:39:00,457 --> 01:39:03,223
Come on. We've got
To go to work.

2042
01:39:03,423 --> 01:39:05,622
Ok. I'm sober now.

2043
01:39:11,454 --> 01:39:12,753
Gunner, I...

2044
01:39:12,953 --> 01:39:15,053
Don't worry, ann.
I'll make up for that.

2045
01:39:15,253 --> 01:39:17,785
I won't let you
Down again.

2046
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:19,851
Ok, pal?

2047
01:39:21,485 --> 01:39:22,851
Ok, pal.

2048
01:39:24,317 --> 01:39:26,517
3 roads.
We'll walk 'em good.

2049
01:39:35,414 --> 01:39:36,980
Ok.

2050
01:40:09,605 --> 01:40:11,405
For a nice fella, you've
Certainly turned into a crab.

2051
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:13,404
I never saw
Anything like it.

2052
01:40:13,604 --> 01:40:14,904
She lifts nice.

2053
01:40:15,104 --> 01:40:17,903
She'd do better if she didn't
Have so much weight in her.

2054
01:40:18,103 --> 01:40:20,235
You're heavier
Than lead these days.

2055
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:36,031
Calling w.s.r.
From Lane.

2056
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:37,165
Yes.

2057
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:39,164
Lane at 7,000 feet.

2058
01:40:39,364 --> 01:40:41,197
Starting up
Through overcast.

2059
01:40:41,397 --> 01:40:42,696
Going on instruments.

2060
01:40:42,896 --> 01:40:44,530
On north bead.

2061
01:40:57,226 --> 01:40:58,558
There she is.

2062
01:40:58,758 --> 01:41:00,025
We're coming, honey!

2063
01:41:00,225 --> 01:41:01,557
There's the sky.

2064
01:41:01,757 --> 01:41:03,891
Little alice
Blue gown.

2065
01:41:12,555 --> 01:41:13,888
W.s.r. From Lane.

2066
01:41:14,088 --> 01:41:16,220
15,100.

2067
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:19,220
On top first layer.

2068
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:21,219
Switching over
To high blower.

2069
01:41:21,419 --> 01:41:23,186
We'll call you in 20.

2070
01:41:23,386 --> 01:41:24,718
That's right.

2071
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:26,651
Switching over
To oxygen-

2072
01:41:26,851 --> 01:41:28,984
Hot air to you.

2073
01:41:37,915 --> 01:41:39,014
W.s.r., Lane.

2074
01:41:39,214 --> 01:41:40,681
New record
For weight-

2075
01:41:40,881 --> 01:41:42,315
20,200.

2076
01:41:42,515 --> 01:41:44,180
Full throttle.

2077
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:47,512
Manifold pressure-
34.5.

2078
01:41:47,712 --> 01:41:50,145
Rate of climb-
600 feet.

2079
01:41:50,345 --> 01:41:52,678
Fuel flow-76.

2080
01:41:52,878 --> 01:41:55,177
R.p.m.-2,200.

2081
01:41:55,377 --> 01:41:57,344
And it's 30 or bust.

2082
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,309
Think nothing of it.

2083
01:42:10,739 --> 01:42:13,205
Yeah. We're at 26.

2084
01:42:13,405 --> 01:42:15,705
Manifold pressure
Dropping.

2085
01:42:15,905 --> 01:42:17,704
We're about washed.

2086
01:42:20,371 --> 01:42:22,037
Turn the heat full on.

2087
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:23,870
It is full on.

2088
01:42:35,334 --> 01:42:37,033
29,350.

2089
01:42:37,233 --> 01:42:39,665
Get up there,
Baby girl! Get up!

2090
01:42:39,865 --> 01:42:41,132
Can't hear you.

2091
01:42:41,332 --> 01:42:44,131
2-9-3-5-0.

2092
01:42:44,331 --> 01:42:48,330
29,350!

2093
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:50,329
Never mind.

2094
01:42:50,529 --> 01:42:52,295
That washes that.

2095
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:01,160
We're about through, too.
She's washed.

2096
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,659
Oh, no, she's not.

2097
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:04,625
She's choking
To death!

2098
01:43:04,825 --> 01:43:06,958
30! 30, I tell you!

2099
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,822
Isn't this high enough?
What more do you want?

2100
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:15,856
I want 30. I said 30!

2101
01:43:16,056 --> 01:43:18,855
I want 30, and that's
The end of it!

2102
01:43:24,553 --> 01:43:26,120
50 more.

2103
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,586
Squeeze!

2104
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:30,618
Squeeze! Squeeze!

2105
01:43:40,316 --> 01:43:41,615
She's over!

2106
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:43,081
Yay!
Yay!

2107
01:43:43,281 --> 01:43:45,448
Don't let her
Fall off!

2108
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:51,979
It's the stabilizer!

2109
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:56,978
W.s.r. From Lane.
W.s.r. From Lane!

2110
01:44:01,377 --> 01:44:03,143
Let's see you get
A hotel out of a spin.

2111
01:44:03,343 --> 01:44:05,808
Wait till we get down. We'll let in
Some air. Feel all right, don't you?

2112
01:44:06,008 --> 01:44:07,641
Oh, I feel charming.

2113
01:44:11,707 --> 01:44:13,806
Why don't we ditch the sand?
She's got to be light.

2114
01:44:14,006 --> 01:44:15,806
Plenty of time, pal.

2115
01:44:28,437 --> 01:44:29,836
Uh!

2116
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,667
Go on! Beat it!

2117
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:46,299
Can you move any? Give me
An inch on that wheel!

2118
01:44:46,499 --> 01:44:49,098
No. Go on! Get out!

2119
01:47:04,262 --> 01:47:05,528
Gunner?

2120
01:47:05,728 --> 01:47:07,428
Gunner!

2121
01:47:10,261 --> 01:47:12,060
Jim.

2122
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:14,093
What?

2123
01:47:14,293 --> 01:47:16,558
Are you all right?

2124
01:47:16,758 --> 01:47:19,591
Yeah. Sure.

2125
01:47:19,791 --> 01:47:22,090
Aw, he's tough.

2126
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:24,157
Hey, can you move any?

2127
01:47:24,357 --> 01:47:27,989
Sure.
I'm just taking it easy.

2128
01:47:28,189 --> 01:47:30,821
Don't do anything
Dumb on me.

2129
01:47:32,221 --> 01:47:33,520
Jim?

2130
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:36,020
What?

2131
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,552
Just listen.

2132
01:47:38,752 --> 01:47:40,551
I got so many words.

2133
01:47:40,751 --> 01:47:42,718
Let me string 'em.

2134
01:47:44,419 --> 01:47:47,550
Don't take anyone
In my place.

2135
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,383
You're so dumb.

2136
01:47:50,749 --> 01:47:53,115
You don't know
How good I was.

2137
01:47:53,315 --> 01:47:56,281
You just loved me.

2138
01:47:56,481 --> 01:47:59,214
And I was
Awful good, see?

2139
01:48:01,579 --> 01:48:03,779
Give ann a kiss.

2140
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:06,413
Gunner.

2141
01:48:09,711 --> 01:48:12,411
Here's a break for me,
Though.

2142
01:48:13,943 --> 01:48:18,741
I won't ever have to go home
And break the news to her.

2143
01:48:18,941 --> 01:48:20,942
I leave the roads first.

2144
01:48:21,142 --> 01:48:22,574
Don't die...

2145
01:48:22,774 --> 01:48:24,707
For my sake.

2146
01:48:27,739 --> 01:48:30,738
That's all
I'd come back for...

2147
01:48:30,938 --> 01:48:32,571
If I could.

2148
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:07,562
Oh, my dear boy.
I'm sorry.

2149
01:49:07,762 --> 01:49:09,429
Thanks.

2150
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,124
Why wasn't it you?

2151
01:49:26,324 --> 01:49:28,323
It couldn't have been
You, could it?

2152
01:49:28,523 --> 01:49:30,722
Oh, no. I've got more
Coming to me.

2153
01:49:30,922 --> 01:49:33,555
I've got to get all
That's coming to me.

2154
01:49:33,755 --> 01:49:36,055
Another year maybe,
Another year first.

2155
01:49:36,255 --> 01:49:38,887
I'll go crazy first!

2156
01:49:39,087 --> 01:49:42,686
Why don't you die
And leave me alone?

2157
01:49:51,284 --> 01:49:53,916
Got a kiss
For you, ann.

2158
01:49:55,783 --> 01:49:57,582
His last crack.

2159
01:49:57,782 --> 01:49:59,549
Go on. What else?

2160
01:49:59,749 --> 01:50:02,415
What are you
Going to say?

2161
01:50:03,781 --> 01:50:05,580
Your heart's
Bleeding.

2162
01:50:06,947 --> 01:50:09,279
Aren't you going
To say that?

2163
01:50:10,446 --> 01:50:12,245
My heart isn't
Bleeding a drop.

2164
01:50:12,445 --> 01:50:14,179
My memory of the gunner
Is beautiful.

2165
01:50:14,379 --> 01:50:16,077
I believe you.

2166
01:50:16,277 --> 01:50:17,577
You have no heart.

2167
01:50:17,777 --> 01:50:20,076
You don't know
What pain is.

2168
01:50:20,276 --> 01:50:22,076
But you'll have
Company.

2169
01:50:22,276 --> 01:50:25,109
I love you with
My heart, Jim Lane,

2170
01:50:25,309 --> 01:50:27,541
But it won't last
Much longer.

2171
01:50:27,741 --> 01:50:30,041
Pain is
Eating it away.

2172
01:50:30,241 --> 01:50:32,506
He died at his trade, didn't
He? What more do you want?

2173
01:50:32,706 --> 01:50:35,539
That's great. Go right
Back up in the sky...

2174
01:50:35,739 --> 01:50:37,705
That awful sky!

2175
01:50:39,071 --> 01:50:41,205
Go up there
And stay!

2176
01:50:48,069 --> 01:50:50,701
We have nothing
To talk about, ann.

2177
01:51:01,598 --> 01:51:02,565
Howdy.
Hello.

2178
01:51:02,765 --> 01:51:04,231
We had a little
Hard luck.

2179
01:51:04,431 --> 01:51:06,564
I don't know if it was
My fault or not.

2180
01:51:06,764 --> 01:51:08,063
Oh, I guess not.

2181
01:51:08,263 --> 01:51:10,063
You guessed it good.
28,000-cinch.

2182
01:51:10,263 --> 01:51:12,062
29-maybe.
30-good night.

2183
01:51:12,262 --> 01:51:14,062
Safe at 28, huh?
That's wonderful.

2184
01:51:14,262 --> 01:51:16,561
Who are you going
To give me now?

2185
01:51:16,761 --> 01:51:18,561
I don't know.
Who do you want?

2186
01:51:18,761 --> 01:51:20,060
Jerry carter's
All right.

2187
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:21,560
Sure,
He's all right.

2188
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,059
Ok with me. We'll take the
Sister ship up tomorrow.

2189
01:51:24,259 --> 01:51:26,059
Fine. How about a little layoff first?

2190
01:51:26,259 --> 01:51:27,992
I don't want any, see?
I'm a test pilot.

2191
01:51:28,192 --> 01:51:29,992
We live long enough
To build a floor up there

2192
01:51:30,192 --> 01:51:32,690
So that someday the world can go to
Bed on it. That's the idea, isn't it?

2193
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:34,157
You're
A tough man.

2194
01:51:34,357 --> 01:51:36,689
How else do you figure it? And
Listen, I haven't started yet.

2195
01:51:36,889 --> 01:51:38,355
I'll go back up there.

2196
01:51:38,555 --> 01:51:41,022
I'm going back up there to pay the
Sky back for what she did to me today.

2197
01:51:41,222 --> 01:51:43,021
I'll pay her back.
I'll wring her neck!

2198
01:51:43,221 --> 01:51:45,021
And I'll show ann something she
Won't forget in a hurry either!

2199
01:51:45,221 --> 01:51:47,020
I'll show her! I'll go back
Up there, and I'll stay there!

2200
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:48,987
I'll never come down!
I'll...

2201
01:51:49,187 --> 01:51:51,019
What-what am I
Talking about?

2202
01:51:51,219 --> 01:51:54,518
I can't talk-what did you
Let me talk like this for?

2203
01:51:54,718 --> 01:51:56,851
What's the matter
With me?

2204
01:51:59,217 --> 01:52:00,716
You went home,
Didn't you?

2205
01:52:00,916 --> 01:52:02,682
I don't know. I don't
Know what came off.

2206
01:52:02,882 --> 01:52:04,648
She's going screwy,
I guess. I don't know.

2207
01:52:04,848 --> 01:52:06,515
Maybe she's
In love with you.

2208
01:52:06,715 --> 01:52:10,081
Hmm. You should have been there.
It sounded more like she hated me.

2209
01:52:10,281 --> 01:52:15,046
If she doesn't love you, she's got
A mighty funny way of showing it.

2210
01:52:15,246 --> 01:52:19,045
You should have been with us
This morning after you went up.

2211
01:52:19,245 --> 01:52:21,544
When the general
Asked her for lunch,

2212
01:52:21,744 --> 01:52:24,710
She said until you
Came down, she was dead.

2213
01:52:29,642 --> 01:52:30,975
Did she say that?

2214
01:52:31,175 --> 01:52:33,808
Yes, sir. That's
Just what she said.

2215
01:52:35,441 --> 01:52:38,506
She's a nice girl. I always
Thought I got on with her all right.

2216
01:52:38,706 --> 01:52:42,005
I can see how another guy would
Hang around the house with her

2217
01:52:42,205 --> 01:52:45,505
And have a couple of babies and all
That applesauce, but that's not for me.

2218
01:52:45,705 --> 01:52:48,004
You know I'm right.
You know me.

2219
01:52:48,204 --> 01:52:50,003
Oh, sure, Jim.
I know.

2220
01:52:50,203 --> 01:52:53,003
It was in this very
Office I bawled you out

2221
01:52:53,203 --> 01:52:56,468
Because you brought a girl to
New york instead of a record.

2222
01:52:56,668 --> 01:52:58,334
You remember that,
Don't you?

2223
01:52:58,534 --> 01:52:59,501
Yeah, sure.

2224
01:52:59,701 --> 01:53:01,333
Remember what
You called her?

2225
01:53:01,533 --> 01:53:03,167
You called her
Another peach.

2226
01:53:03,367 --> 01:53:04,500
Yeah?

2227
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:08,464
Yeah, and while she never
Got much of a start with me,

2228
01:53:08,664 --> 01:53:11,232
I have to admit
She's just that.

2229
01:53:11,432 --> 01:53:15,530
She's a nice girl, but we
Got no business being married.

2230
01:53:15,730 --> 01:53:18,529
You can say this
Much for it anyway-

2231
01:53:18,729 --> 01:53:21,828
It comes in handy
Tonight because...

2232
01:53:22,028 --> 01:53:23,494
Well, Jim...

2233
01:53:23,694 --> 01:53:27,094
I think if that oil
Hadn't spouted over kansas

2234
01:53:27,294 --> 01:53:29,426
And she was
In kansas tonight

2235
01:53:29,626 --> 01:53:31,959
Instead of
In your home here,

2236
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:33,959
It would be
Pretty tough.

2237
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:35,791
Wouldn't it?

2238
01:53:37,158 --> 01:53:39,456
Ah... Yeah.
I'll give her that.

2239
01:53:39,656 --> 01:53:41,923
I kind of wish
She knew that.

2240
01:53:42,123 --> 01:53:44,822
I think it
Would please her.

2241
01:53:46,189 --> 01:53:48,155
Do you think she'd
Like to hear that?

2242
01:53:48,355 --> 01:53:50,154
You know how it is.

2243
01:53:50,354 --> 01:53:52,487
You know how women take
Those little things.

2244
01:53:52,687 --> 01:53:55,287
Always seems to please them
For some reason or other.

2245
01:53:57,186 --> 01:53:58,451
It does, huh?

2246
01:53:58,651 --> 01:53:59,985
Yes.

2247
01:54:00,185 --> 01:54:01,450
Yeah?

2248
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:03,484
Oh, yes.

2249
01:54:03,684 --> 01:54:05,649
Well, then...

2250
01:54:07,383 --> 01:54:09,949
Do you really think it would please
Her if I went home and told her that?

2251
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:13,315
I think it would
Make her very happy.

2252
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:19,013
Well... I don't mind
Doing that,

2253
01:54:19,213 --> 01:54:20,679
If you say so.

2254
01:54:20,879 --> 01:54:22,445
I'd say so, Jim.

2255
01:54:24,644 --> 01:54:26,911
All right.

2256
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:28,910
I guess I will.

2257
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,710
Thanks for the advice.

2258
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:32,776
That's
All right, Jim.

2259
01:54:48,505 --> 01:54:51,904
Thursday, this is Drake.
Say, listen, thursday,

2260
01:54:52,104 --> 01:54:55,003
Uh... I've just been
Talking to Jim.

2261
01:54:55,203 --> 01:54:57,470
Where is he?
Is he all right?

2262
01:54:57,670 --> 01:54:58,936
I said
Terrible things.

2263
01:54:59,136 --> 01:55:02,468
I know all about it. There's
Nothing to worry about at all.

2264
01:55:02,668 --> 01:55:04,568
He's on his way home.

2265
01:55:04,768 --> 01:55:09,532
Just listen, thursday, and I'm going to
Tell you something you're going to like.

2266
01:55:09,732 --> 01:55:11,799
He's all through
Test piloting.

2267
01:55:11,999 --> 01:55:14,298
He's in love
With you, thursday.

2268
01:55:14,498 --> 01:55:15,798
Oh.

2269
01:55:15,998 --> 01:55:17,263
Yes, "oh."

2270
01:55:17,463 --> 01:55:20,663
He doesn't know this
Himself, but I'm telling you,

2271
01:55:20,863 --> 01:55:23,463
He'd rather be with you
Than in the sky,

2272
01:55:23,663 --> 01:55:26,895
And when a man's heart's down
Here, he's no more good up there.

2273
01:55:27,095 --> 01:55:28,394
Oh.

2274
01:55:28,594 --> 01:55:30,894
Don't ever let him know
Anything about it,

2275
01:55:31,094 --> 01:55:34,927
And pretty soon Mr. Jim Lane
Will be working on the ground,

2276
01:55:35,127 --> 01:55:37,859
And he'll never know
How he got there.

2277
01:55:38,059 --> 01:55:39,891
Oh, Mr. Drake,
Are you sure?

2278
01:55:40,091 --> 01:55:42,890
I've only made one mistake
In my life, thursday,

2279
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:46,889
And that's the first time
I saw you from a distance.

2280
01:55:47,089 --> 01:55:48,389
Good-bye, thursday.

2281
01:55:48,589 --> 01:55:51,755
You're going to hear a lot
Of squawking from him,

2282
01:55:51,955 --> 01:55:54,253
But don't let that
Bother you.

2283
01:55:54,453 --> 01:55:57,920
Just smile up your sleeve
And let him squawk.

2284
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:01,120
I won't mind
The squawking.

2285
01:56:02,618 --> 01:56:04,286
I'll just...

2286
01:56:05,651 --> 01:56:07,285
What's that,
Thursday?

2287
01:56:08,817 --> 01:56:15,283
I said, I hope he squawks
And squawks and squawks.

2288
01:56:17,981 --> 01:56:19,448
I've been talking for
30 minutes to you boys,

2289
01:56:19,648 --> 01:56:21,447
And you're probably looking
Wise and giving me the bird.

2290
01:56:21,647 --> 01:56:23,947
I don't know what I'm doing here
Talking to you in the first place.

2291
01:56:24,147 --> 01:56:26,746
I got out of the army once,
And I don't know how I got back.

2292
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:30,244
And I'm not flying. I'm talking,
If you can beat that one.

2293
01:56:30,444 --> 01:56:31,811
Anybody got
Any questions?

2294
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:35,410
All right. Uh...
Good luck and...

2295
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:39,176
And, uh... Well,
Go on and get in.

2296
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,859
What's the idea? What are
You doing over here anyway?

2297
01:57:41,059 --> 01:57:42,893
You weren't here when I
Was handing out the baloney.

2298
01:57:43,093 --> 01:57:44,558
Yes, dear,
We were here.

2299
01:57:44,758 --> 01:57:45,725
We?

2300
01:57:45,925 --> 01:57:48,223
Hello, pal. How are you?
I didn't see you.

2301
01:57:48,423 --> 01:57:51,723
Haven't I told you not to bring
The kid around a place like this?

2302
01:57:51,923 --> 01:57:54,389
Do you know how many
Engines there are over there?

2303
01:57:54,589 --> 01:57:57,755
Don't you realize that his ears
Are delicate? Might hurt him.

2304
01:57:59,854 --> 01:58:01,688
What's the matter with
Those guys, anyway?

2305
01:58:01,888 --> 01:58:04,288
Come on, barney. Get up
There. What's eating you?

2306
01:58:07,518 --> 01:58:09,153
I bet you
They don't make it.

2307
01:58:09,353 --> 01:58:11,217
I don't know why I'm not
Up there in front of them.

2308
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:13,384
A man spends his whole
Life getting somewhere,

2309
01:58:13,584 --> 01:58:15,417
And where
Does he end up?

2310
01:58:15,617 --> 01:58:17,416
Nowhere, just where
He started.
