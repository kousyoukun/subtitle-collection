1
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,720
Movement.

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,090
Two men.

3
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,130
Approximately

4
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,370
40 goats.

5
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,200
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,300
Egress?

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,880
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,380
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,230
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,270
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,710
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,210
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,210
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,890
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,160
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,460
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,900
Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.

19
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,630
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

20
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,230
Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.

21
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,250
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

22
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,680
I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.

23
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,220
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

24
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,150
Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

25
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,620
possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.

26
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,920
Call them out.

27
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,360
Target.

28
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,860
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,230
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,300
Range it.

31
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,600
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,010
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,210
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,940
On target.

35
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,380
Hold scope.

36
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,820
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,450
Hit.

38
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,290
Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.

39
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,800
Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.

40
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,510
Call it in. It's time to go.

41
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,520
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

42
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,640
- Packing up.
- Shit!

43
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,120
Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.

44
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,550
Weren't supposed to be
hostiles that close!

45
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,970
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

46
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,000
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

47
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,440
Fire when ready.

48
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,550
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.

49
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,750
- I see it, Donnie. I see it.
- Fire when ready.

50
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,930
- They don't know where we are.
- But they might get lucky!

51
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,400
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

52
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,770
Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.

53
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,610
Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.

54
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,610
We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.

55
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,790
Command Post, do you read me?

56
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,120
Shut it down.

57
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,360
They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,220
eight kilometers inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,660
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

60
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,230
Radio check. Do you read me?

61
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,390
- Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
- Do you read me?

62
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,160
- Pull out those tracks.
- Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

63
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,140
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

64
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,380
Call it in!

65
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,520
Shit! The channel's down!

66
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,650
That's impossible!

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,090
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,930
Donnie?

70
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,770
Donnie!

71
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,830
Come on, boy!

72
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,860
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,800
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,930
Come on.

75
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,130
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,310
What?

77
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,500
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,250
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,920
Good boy.

80
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,540
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,500
Here, boy.

82
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,140
Good boy.

83
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,190
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,790
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,260
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,960
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,370
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,910
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,840
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,210
No official report.

91
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,550
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,740
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,020
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,020
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,890
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,090
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,530
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,840
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,080
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,880
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

101
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,390
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,820
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,200
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,980
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,780
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,060
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,190
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,860
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,230
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,860
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,170
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,830
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,030
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,010
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

115
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,510
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,100
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,650
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,570
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

119
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,020
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,250
He understands.

121
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,280
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,520
Slowly.

123
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,760
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,730
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,230
You know what that is?

126
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,270
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

127
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,370
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,510
Yours?

129
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,210
Yeah.

130
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,300
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,940
What did you do?

132
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,780
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,650
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,850
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,690
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,330
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,460
Whose president?

138
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,590
Ours.

139
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,600
I didn't say 'execute'.

140
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,340
Plan.

141
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,200
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,940
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,380
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,050
It was internal.

145
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,520
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,460
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,020
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,630
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,570
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,500
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,280
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,370
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,240
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,260
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,690
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,700
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,640
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,330
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,440
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,070
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,270
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,710
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

164
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,910
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,110
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,450
President'll be wearing body amour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,720
at over a mile.

168
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,090
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,420
Yes.

170
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,900
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,370
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,230
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,300
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,310
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,270
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,110
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,650
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,510
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,620
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,380
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,160
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,920
against all enemies,

183
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,660
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,700
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,700
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,910
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,410
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,180
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,050
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,010
The truck.

192
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,980
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,640
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

194
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,450
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,450
This is beautiful.

197
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,700
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,500
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,910
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,540
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,980
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,570
This is our guy.

203
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,080
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,620
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,560
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,030
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,460
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,950
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,080
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.

210
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,450
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,700
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
Okay.

213
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,790
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah.

215
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,920
This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.

216
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,860
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,760
Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.

218
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,510
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,520
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,750
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,980
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,390
...both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

223
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,650
were debated and signed here.

224
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,230
Out of the three cities,

225
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,270
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

226
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,170
There was no room in Baltimore.

227
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,710
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

228
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,570
buildings are in the way.

229
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,200
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

230
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,380
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

231
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,440
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

232
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,570
waiting for him in the afterlife,

233
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,210
I'd rule that out.

234
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,450
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

235
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,160
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

236
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,720
It's one of six possible locations,

237
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,760
approximately five stories
above the President's location.

238
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,990
Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.

239
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,330
They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,

240
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,960
several lines into his speech.

241
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,870
That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.

242
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,910
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

243
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,770
Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

244
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,170
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

245
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,300
touch more slippery.

246
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,900
Least that's what I'd do.

247
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,350
You can kill him from that far away?

248
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,320
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

249
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,610
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

250
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,420
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

251
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,290
The challenge is the wind.

252
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,260
Lightest breeze uncorrected
at that distance

253
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,660
is enough to ruin the shot.

254
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,960
He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.

255
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,550
Velocity corrections are easy,

256
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,460
but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.

257
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,540
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

258
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,610
Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.

259
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,770
Impressive recon and report, son.

260
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,900
Move too soon, we lose him.

261
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,310
We want to take him alive.

262
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,940
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

263
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,520
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

264
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,220
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

265
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,450
A moment?

266
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,100
You've done your country
a great service, son.

267
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,190
- On the day...
- Look...

268
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,360
Listen.

269
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,770
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

270
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,600
I could use a spotter.

271
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,410
Thank you, Philadelphia.

272
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,600
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

273
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,340
...before you on this stage...

274
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,110
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

275
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,310
...patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,

276
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,180
the Declaration of Independence...

277
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,410
Sir?

278
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,150
...and a country,
the United States of America,

279
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,690
that changed the world.

280
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,120
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

281
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,030
Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.

282
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,890
Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

283
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,490
All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.

284
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,000
- Stand by.
- Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

285
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,370
Copy that.

286
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,850
Post 18 clear, over.

287
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,580
Post 19, please report.
What's your status?

288
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,020
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

289
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,560
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

290
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,150
The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

291
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,920
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

292
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,590
There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop

293
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,860
as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.

294
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,340
He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony

295
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,770
to discuss these matters.

296
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,170
These are great times.

297
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,410
These are historic times.

298
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,810
And these are troubled times, as well.

299
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,950
This medal that your country...

300
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,280
Yellow ribbons.

301
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,950
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

302
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,290
No, they tie those low around trees.

303
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,560
These are windage flags.

304
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,230
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

305
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,820
for a shot from the steeple.

306
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,200
Yeah. Maybe.

307
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,360
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

308
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,400
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

309
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,340
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

310
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,110
...raises its head
and confronts freedom,

311
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:47,550
but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.

312
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,350
And it is our responsibility

313
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,690
to find these dark weeds.

314
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,450
Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

315
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,530
- If you just joined us...
- Hi.

316
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,260
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

317
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,870
Bob Lee Swagger.

318
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,740
It is a real honor to meet you.

319
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,540
You're unsnapped, officer.

320
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,000
Shit. Oh, fuck.

321
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,380
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

322
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,980
Again, it's an honor.

323
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,950
...of our stewardship of this great...

324
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,590
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

325
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,960
He's getting a medal. Know it?

326
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,160
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

327
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,240
You know I worked there?

328
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,140
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

329
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,170
when you shoot a civilian, right?

330
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,570
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

331
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,150
That's very original.

332
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,520
Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.

333
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,110
The President speaks next.

334
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,480
All teams stand by.

335
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,910
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.

336
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,690
Agent James, all clear.

337
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,820
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

338
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,860
- Got wind at three, full value.
- ... to introduce to you

339
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,930
the President of the United States.

340
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,130
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

341
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,100
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

342
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,360
He's loaded.

343
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,400
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

344
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,100
In the city that was the capital of...

345
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,670
We got to take him.

346
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,240
Ten seconds.

347
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,000
Wind matches his setup.
Take him! Take him now!

348
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,510
Send in the ERT team. Take out the...

349
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,610
Shots fired! Shots fired!

350
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,200
Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.

351
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,390
- What? Flashlight down?
- I say again. Flashlight is down.

352
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,530
- The President has been shot.
- There's mass confusion...

353
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,770
Has the President been shot?

354
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
Right at the church steeple.

355
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
How could you miss?

356
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,010
How could you fucking miss?

357
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,280
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

358
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,980
He's bleeding. Kill him.

359
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,020
Command Post to Condor Two,
load up, over.

360
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,600
Condor Two loading up.

361
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,260
Go, go, go, go, go!

362
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,540
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

363
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,360
Condor Two, this is Command Post.
Stand by for update, over.

364
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,820
Standing by, over.

365
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,890
Command Post!

366
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,330
Command Post!
Command Post, this is Post 19.

367
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,460
You guys read me?

368
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,630
- Should I hold post?
- Please.

369
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,000
Please help me. Please. They shot me.

370
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,370
- FBl. Put your hands up!
- Please. Hey.

371
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,580
Save me.

372
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,680
What?

373
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,250
Give me the keys.

374
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,020
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

375
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,750
Help!

376
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,590
FBl! Took my weapon and my car.

377
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,200
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

378
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,140
CP, 17, can you repeat
possible suspect description?

379
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,270
Negative, no further at this time.

380
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,900
CP, this is 15.
No activity at my location.

381
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,070
I am available to move if necessary.

382
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,510
Copy that.

383
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,650
This is Officer Timmons
requesting backup.

384
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,690
Pursuing suspect in assassination.

385
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,920
Now fleeing in stolen FBl vehicle,
moving south on Front from Diamond.

386
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,660
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
I repeat,

387
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,890
suspect is armed and dangerous.

388
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,370
All Philly PD units be advised,

389
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,370
assassination suspect is fleeing
in a stolen FBl vehicle.

390
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,170
He is going south
on Front from Diamond.

391
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,240
This is Condor 2. We are transitioning
from roadhouse to Front Street.

392
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,540
Please advise for further description
of suspect vehicle.

393
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,950
Dispatch, 419,
I'm heading south on Thompson.

394
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,110
Do we have a color,
anything on the vehicle?

395
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,390
Assassination suspect's vehicle

396
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,330
is one government-issue
black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.

397
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,100
Pennsylvania license number
7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.

398
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,330
What was suspect's
last known location? Over.

399
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,640
Last known is south on Front.

400
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,480
This is Agent James. Do we have
multiple suspects or a single suspect?

401
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,080
Agent James, negative.
No further information...

402
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,820
This is Agent Pittman.
Car seen going high speed on Castor.

403
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,990
High speed on Castor. Be advised.

404
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,960
Timmons called it in?

405
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,300
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

406
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,140
- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

407
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,970
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

408
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
it doesn't really matter.

409
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,270
They're going to find him lying dead
by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.

410
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,420
What is your location?

411
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,860
Suspect vehicle a black sedan,
four-door...

412
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,840
All units be advised,

413
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,390
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle
entering High-Tech Car Wash

414
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,320
on the northwest corner
of Girard and 9th, over.

415
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,390
Command Post be advised,

416
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,920
this is Condor Two en route
to suspect location, over.

417
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,520
Command Post, Condor Three copies.
All en route.

418
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,000
- Yo, man!
- Watch it, man!

419
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,380
Shit!

420
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,030
Command Post, Condors Two
and Three moving to intercept, over.

421
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,400
Suspect vehicle collided with a truck
under the 95.

422
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,310
He's at Market and Columbus.

423
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,650
Looks good. Vehicle is disabled.
Repeat, vehicle disabled.

424
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,650
Take him down! Fire!

425
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,020
I got a Crown Vic. Black.
Government plates.

426
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,220
Dead guy in the front seat?

427
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,830
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

428
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,000
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

429
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,350
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

430
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,030
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

431
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,170
The would-be assassin,
tentatively identified

432
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,760
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

433
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,430
is being pursued by thousands of State
and Federal law enforcement personnel

434
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,740
as we speak.

435
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,580
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

436
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,980
Nothing but an abandoned car
has been found

437
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,950
at the bottom of the Delaware River.

438
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,680
Seven-year veteran Philadelphia
police officer Stanley Timmons,

439
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,280
first to respond to the scene,

440
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,380
is believed to have shot
and injured Swagger.

441
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,660
Early reports indicate that the assailant

442
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,760
may have been hit
as many as two times.

443
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,600
Meanwhile, the FBl has been
unwilling to comment

444
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,000
on information that an agent of theirs

445
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,230
was assaulted and disarmed
by Swagger as he fled the scene,

446
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,810
possibly in a stolen FBl vehicle.

447
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,440
At this time, no sign of Swagger
has been found.

448
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,610
You have embarrassed this office.

449
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,120
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

450
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,210
Sir...

451
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,520
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

452
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,560
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

453
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,560
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

454
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,830
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

455
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,780
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

456
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,240
Because he didn't.

457
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,980
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

458
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,420
He never said that.

459
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,650
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

460
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,250
You got your ass kicked.

461
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,760
You're misremembering.

462
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,590
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

463
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,500
Have you given
your official statement yet?

464
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,590
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

465
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,870
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

466
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,140
Can you believe this fucking guy?

467
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,740
There you go.

468
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,600
- Yes?
- The raw feeds are in

469
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,610
from the networks.

470
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,560
...development, security camera footage
from Washington, D.C.

471
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,640
and several locations in Philadelphia

472
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,970
shows the suspect,
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,

473
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,030
scouting shooting locations,
traveling and taking wind readings.

474
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:41,010
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

475
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,810
Excuse me.

476
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,010
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

477
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,350
Please. I got cash,
and you can keep the change.

478
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,180
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

479
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,760
Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

480
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,330
couple bottles of water.

481
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,250
How many?

482
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,330
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,940
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

484
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,880
but we don't take care
of those things here.

485
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,040
- Yeah. Okay, well...
- The FBl released a video letter...

486
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,180
- ... see a counselor.
- ... threatening the life of the President...

487
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,310
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

488
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,690
...signed and dated
by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

489
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,390
Federal agents today
executed a search warrant

490
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,690
in the Wind River range of Wyoming

491
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,700
where Swagger had been living
for several years.

492
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,200
In the meantime, the FBl
has been unwilling to comment,

493
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,630
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

494
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,940
- Get anything?
- No.

495
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,400
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

496
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,940
And? Yes?

497
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,210
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

498
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,650
- What'd he buy?
- Gotta be.

499
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,750
Salt, sugar, water,
and a marinade injector.

500
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,220
Guy going to a barbecue.

501
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,920
Salt, water, an injector could be used
for an IV,

502
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,090
but what's with the sugar?

503
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

504
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,160
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

505
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,240
for hundreds of years.

506
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,570
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

507
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,110
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

508
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,680
You go into Howard's office
with the Napoleonic War,

509
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,970
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

510
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,310
Go back to your desk.
I'm saving your life.

511
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,240
One thing is...

512
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,200
...1790 to 1800.

513
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,510
One thing is...

514
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,120
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

515
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,660
I know who you are.

516
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,630
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

517
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,360
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

518
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,560
I know.

519
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,650
You do?

520
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,290
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

521
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,900
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

522
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,770
Look, you're a nurse, right?

523
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,470
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

524
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,780
I teach the third grade.

525
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,080
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

526
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,280
Please.

527
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,540
Please?

528
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,880
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

529
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,460
I swear.

530
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,190
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

531
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,820
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

532
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,000
You still figuring on shooting me?

533
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,900
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

534
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,130
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

535
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,210
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

536
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,180
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

537
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,810
You'd best call me Sarah.

538
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,110
All right.

539
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,600
911, what's your emergency?

540
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,320
Hello?

541
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,270
This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.

542
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,900
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over
the trash cans

543
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,500
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

544
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,580
Okay, then.

545
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,850
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

546
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,010
they call you back right away.

547
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,630
I should've come
and seen you in person.

548
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,030
Before. I mean, then.

549
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,500
Yeah, I read the letter.

550
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,870
It was okay.

551
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,140
And once a year I got the flowers.

552
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,170
You don't look real good.

553
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,480
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

554
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,560
Why aren't you?

555
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,020
Well, the U.S. government spent
a lot of time and money

556
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,920
teaching me how not to die

557
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,520
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

558
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,230
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

559
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,700
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

560
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:23,770
Yeah.

561
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,710
You got to try to spread it out.

562
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,180
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

563
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,410
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

564
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,950
Mileage can be rough.

565
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,100
No one ever beats me in.

566
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,740
You never left.

567
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,770
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

568
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,010
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

569
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,550
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

570
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,050
Where did all this stuff come from?

571
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,850
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

572
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,860
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

573
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,370
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

574
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,270
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

575
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,000
You need to get some sleep.

576
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,870
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

577
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,810
22 minutes after the shooting.

578
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,940
We're good at our jobs.

579
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,520
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

580
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,740
The scene was locked down.

581
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,350
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

582
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,550
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

583
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,990
We're not that good at our jobs.

584
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,450
- You want to see something?
- Probably not.

585
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,930
I downloaded this.

586
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,160
This is a full-scale printout

587
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,260
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

588
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,630
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

589
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,470
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

590
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,770
Five shots,

591
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,340
at 1,000 yards,

592
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,840
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

593
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,710
It was the capital of the United States...

594
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,350
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

595
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,890
This is the wind speed and direction

596
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,250
according to the
National Weather Service

597
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,660
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

598
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,390
Now, how does a man who can do that

599
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,460
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

600
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,260
I don't get it.

601
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,200
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

602
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,430
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

603
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,770
He said he was walking foot patrol,

604
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,470
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

605
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,410
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

606
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,420
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

607
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,280
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

608
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,590
It doesn't make any sense.

609
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,490
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

610
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,690
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

611
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,290
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

612
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,460
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

613
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,970
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

614
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,070
Bad things happen to good people.

615
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,200
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

616
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,650
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

617
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,820
But it'll cut loose again.

618
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,220
I held off the worst of the infection,
but you're gonna have to open it up,

619
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,120
cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

620
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,100
working your way out,
sewing it together

621
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,000
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

622
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,870
You ready for this?

623
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,900
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s
and pass out.

624
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,410
Good luck, okay?

625
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,790
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

626
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,320
That our guy in the collar?

627
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,650
Whose president?

628
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,160
I didn't say 'execute'.

629
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,160
He's getting a medal. Know it?

630
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,500
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

631
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,400
You need to find the shooter.

632
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,710
No.

633
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,690
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

634
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,190
Find me something.

635
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,460
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

636
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,330
He's not dead.

637
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,570
Tear apart his life.

638
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,000
Again.

639
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,270
Go okay?

640
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,980
I've been hallucinating.

641
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,920
Something I need to tell you.

642
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,990
Ralphie's dead.

643
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,320
Who's Ralphie?

644
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,900
Well, they said you shot your dog

645
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,900
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

646
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,470
They said that, huh?

647
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,310
Name was Sam.

648
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,880
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

649
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,140
You okay?

650
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,090
No.

651
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,950
What are you gonna do?

652
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,090
I'll get better.

653
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,450
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

654
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,430
Can I help you?

655
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,560
Hold still.

656
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,040
I been meaning to ask you.

657
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,440
You have a boyfriend?

658
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,510
Why?

659
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,310
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

660
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,080
It's been three years.

661
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,160
No.

662
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,160
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

663
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,420
walks through that door
without knocking,

664
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,460
wondering where you've been.

665
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,320
Well, no.

666
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,660
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

667
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,460
Not bad.

668
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,390
A little stiff, but...

669
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,170
Hey.

670
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,100
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

671
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,200
That was really brave, what you did.

672
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:13,730
You saved my life.

673
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,440
I'm better. I better get to it.

674
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,880
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

675
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,080
Never.

676
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,520
They're never gonna stop looking.

677
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,660
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

678
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,250
I'm going to give them him.

679
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,830
Excuse me?

680
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,090
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

681
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,480
- Swagger?
- Hey.

682
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:04,020
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

683
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,200
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

684
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,730
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

685
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:12,890
You sure?

686
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,100
Yeah.

687
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,810
Why'd you go?

688
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,340
When they came to see you.

689
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,910
They know which buttons to press.

690
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,810
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

691
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,510
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
'Which way you want me to go, boss?'

692
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,250
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

693
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,990
You know, I got a plan,

694
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,690
but I think I'm going to need your help.

695
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,800
Okay. I'll do it.

696
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,830
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

697
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,530
I know.

698
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,510
Look.

699
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,820
It was my fault.

700
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,590
What?

701
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,320
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

702
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,390
What?

703
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,200
Don't you dare.

704
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,300
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

705
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,080
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

706
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,280
He knew exactly what he was doing

707
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:41,150
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

708
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,820
He loved what he did.

709
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,890
No one made him do it.

710
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,460
That ain't yours to carry.

711
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,000
You're right.

712
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,040
I'm sorry I tried.

713
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,190
It's okay.

714
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,470
I need you to meet with this FBl agent.

715
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,340
Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.

716
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,440
Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.

717
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,020
You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.

718
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,910
You get caught, I get caught.

719
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,580
You know what that is?

720
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,090
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

721
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,490
Well, he's been staying with me.

722
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,650
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

723
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:08,360
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

724
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,070
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

725
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,410
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

726
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:17,550
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

727
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,380
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

728
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,980
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

729
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,550
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

730
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,820
and show me some ID.

731
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,520
I'm not gonna ask you again.

732
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,690
Take your hat off, asshole!

733
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,640
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

734
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,200
Hey, how's it going?

735
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,210
Hey, John.

736
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,930
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

737
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,970
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

738
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,610
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

739
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:05,650
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

740
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,740
in 45 minutes for a review.

741
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,880
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

742
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,060
What do you think?

743
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,200
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

744
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,630
already edited together
to show the angles.

745
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,830
Who delivered them?

746
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:24,340
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

747
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,410
They denied, which is a...

748
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:32,170
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

749
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,110
Of what?

750
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,740
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

751
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:38,980
Oh, come on, just tell me.

752
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,580
You don't want to be here
for that review.

753
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:44,250
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

754
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,830
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

755
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,170
- Thank you.
- Go.

756
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:10,340
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

757
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,540
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

758
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,120
We just traced it to a donut shop
with free WiFi.

759
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,990
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

760
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,890
out of the FBl field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

761
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,590
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the donut shop

762
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,220
only three blocks away
from the field office.

763
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:30,390
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

764
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,700
He lives in Philly.

765
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,370
And he works for the FBl.

766
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,010
Nicholas Memphis.

767
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,900
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

768
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,850
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

769
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,750
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

770
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:45,840
They're definitely not government,

771
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:48,680
but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.

772
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:49,980
These are contractors.

773
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:52,580
I can't tell
what this company does, but...

774
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,450
Hey.

775
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,530
Hey, hey, hey!

776
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,700
Memphis?

777
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,770
Memphis!

778
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:12,880
For a man who didn't know much,

779
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,280
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

780
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,980
Get him some water.

781
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,190
Good.

782
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,970
Got to pee yet?

783
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,940
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

784
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,340
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

785
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,710
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

786
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,750
I'm not going to shoot myself.

787
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:50,680
Sure you will.

788
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,150
Take him out. Get him ready.

789
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,220
No!

790
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,090
That's my gun.

791
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:02,220
Yeah.

792
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,200
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

793
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,630
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

794
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,230
Quit your struggling.

795
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:23,650
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

796
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,850
Russo. Russo!

797
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,580
Davis, get out here!

798
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,560
What is the goddamn hold-up?

799
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,370
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

800
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:20,570
Kill you?

801
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:23,300
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

802
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,340
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

803
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,820
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

804
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:42,250
Help me toss these boys in the water?

805
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,660
You set me up and you used me as bait!

806
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:47,600
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

807
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,730
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

808
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,930
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

809
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,270
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

810
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,310
They can work out some kind of deal.

811
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,140
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

812
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,370
I don't think you understand.

813
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,670
These boys killed my dog.

814
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,520
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

815
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,180
In the end, the law is all...

816
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,990
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

817
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,390
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

818
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:16,020
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

819
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,420
And I'll be dead.

820
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:19,470
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

821
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:21,660
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

822
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:25,000
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

823
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,600
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

824
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,240
You know, I missed a meeting today

825
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:35,800
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

826
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,910
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

827
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,960
I'll take his legs.

828
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,720
It's a good call, Pork.

829
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:50,090
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBl agent

830
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,990
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

831
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,070
No.

832
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,700
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

833
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:00,840
With a.22.

834
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,040
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

835
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,580
And that young kid,

836
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,400
FBl Agent

837
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,080
Nick Memphis,

838
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,990
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

839
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,820
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

840
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,960
What?

841
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,220
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

842
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:29,360
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

843
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,970
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

844
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:35,240
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

845
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,540
She went back to using
her maiden name,

846
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,870
which is why we missed it the first time.

847
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,810
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

848
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,970
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

849
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,490
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

850
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:49,250
It's just within driving range.

851
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,920
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

852
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,400
We've given Swagger a new war,

853
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,300
he's found a new spotter.

854
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,300
This is about to get worse.

855
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,030
I think we're here.

856
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,400
Hey. Swagger.

857
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:46,240
I think we're here.

858
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,480
Welcome to Tennessee.

859
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:53,710
Patron state of shooting stuff.

860
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:57,420
Hey, who is this guy?

861
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,050
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

862
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,220
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

863
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:04,390
than Smith % Wesson.

864
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,990
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

865
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,260
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

866
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:11,960
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

867
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:13,360
Wisdom.

868
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,040
You come to the wrong place.

869
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,410
Maybe.

870
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,100
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

871
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,870
and have it match exactly to another.

872
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,350
Could that be done?

873
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,470
Take a seat.

874
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,580
Have a chair, son.

875
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:34,820
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

876
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,420
could make the grooves match.

877
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:38,860
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

878
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:40,490
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

879
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,160
was completely mangled on impact.

880
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,500
FBl match was metallurgical.

881
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,760
Thank you, Mother.

882
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,270
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

883
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,870
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

884
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,370
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

885
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,550
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

886
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,650
Red leather spine.

887
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,720
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

888
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,800
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

889
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,710
Yeah. Paper patching.

890
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,980
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

891
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:38,320
Paper-wrapped bullet.

892
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:40,950
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

893
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,090
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

894
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,220
Leaves no traces when it hits.

895
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,960
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

896
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,370
I got another one.

897
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,130
I thought you might.

898
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,230
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

899
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,040
Who's alive that could do that?

900
01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:02,740
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

901
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,980
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

902
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,200
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

903
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,310
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

904
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,890
Yeah, they said that, all right.

905
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:13,690
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

906
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:17,220
and WMDs were in Iraq,

907
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:19,990
and Anna Nicole married for love!

908
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,830
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

909
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,000
How come?

910
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,670
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

911
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,670
That's how a conspiracy works.

912
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,410
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

913
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:37,450
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

914
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:38,980
And you know this for a fact?

915
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,880
Still got the shovel.

916
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,890
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

917
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,520
There was a guy in Russia.

918
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,390
They locked his ass up.

919
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,760
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

920
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,530
There was one guy,

921
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,900
but he don't shoot no more.

922
01:16:57,270 --> 01:17:00,030
A brutal son of a bitch.

923
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,270
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

924
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,710
wait till his friends come to help,

925
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,270
kill them too.

926
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,540
Turned one target into four.

927
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,050
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

928
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,420
The other side wanted him. Bad.

929
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,830
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-story building.

930
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,960
They quit the subtle tactics.

931
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,690
They called in an artillery strike.

932
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,700
Leveled a square block.

933
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,960
Brought the building down on his ass.

934
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:34,510
Some say he crawled out of there.

935
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,340
Some say he died.

936
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,380
Never heard from him no more.

937
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,640
Fuck me.

938
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,740
What?

939
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:43,280
I met the son of a bitch.

940
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,780
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

941
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,880
No, sir.

942
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,580
You keep that in mind.

943
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:56,460
The moment you think you got it figured,

944
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,600
you're wrong.

945
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,730
He got a name?

946
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,670
Hey, it's me, Nick.

947
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:12,710
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

948
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,440
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

949
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:16,780
It's better I don't tell you.

950
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,980
Look, do you have a pen?

951
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:22,550
I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

952
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,620
- Yeah.
- You got it?

953
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,710
I got it.

954
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,690
Man, this is hard to spell.

955
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:36,060
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

956
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,430
He'll try to track the shooter.

957
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,060
He won't get far that way.

958
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,660
Yes, he will.

959
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:43,870
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

960
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,040
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

961
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:55,880
And what happens to the bait?

962
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,790
Hard to say.

963
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:02,450
But that's the nature of being the bait.

964
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,870
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?
- He's in Virginia.

965
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:21,040
An end we thought was tied up

966
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,340
came untied.

967
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,940
Meaning, Colonel?

968
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,880
Swagger is still alive.

969
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,690
Oh, my.

970
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:36,960
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

971
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:42,230
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

972
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,800
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

973
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:48,900
Twenty-four good, hard men.

974
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:51,170
Weapons and gear.

975
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,800
Only 24?

976
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,650
Do kill him.

977
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,320
No loose ends this time.

978
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,620
Night, Colonel.

979
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,280
Good night, Senator.

980
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,200
Hello?

981
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:27,810
Someone there?

982
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,210
Now look.

983
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,720
Look what you've done now.

984
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,420
Give me that.

985
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:15,520
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

986
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,870
Where's your boyfriend?

987
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:29,700
What if it's a trap?

988
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,510
Oh, it's a trap.

989
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,940
Guaranteed. Every time.

990
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,510
Question is, for whom?

991
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,850
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

992
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:43,180
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

993
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,220
Let's go.

994
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,780
Okay, so what are these for again?

995
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,190
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

996
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,850
Right.

997
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,200
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

998
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:32,330
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

999
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,600
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

1000
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,140
For as much as we can be.

1001
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,520
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

1002
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,350
Take them one by one.

1003
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,390
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

1004
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,060
Fuck!

1005
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:09,810
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

1006
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,430
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

1007
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:30,050
No. No.

1008
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,430
It's just you and me, baby.

1009
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,590
No!

1010
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,140
You got three guards.

1011
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,470
One at your 2:00,

1012
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:42,970
12:00

1013
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,470
and 10:00.

1014
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,110
Danger close. 2:00,

1015
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,190
fifty yards.

1016
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:00,880
You got one right on you.

1017
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,290
20 yards and closing.

1018
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:54,400
Go check the perimeter.

1019
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,360
And tell the others to stay alert.

1020
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,200
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1021
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:33,870
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1022
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,900
You killed all three?

1023
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:56,170
There were four.

1024
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,560
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1025
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,540
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

1026
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,070
to kill the Archbishop.

1027
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,500
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1028
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,670
And if I don't know any of those things?

1029
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,870
Then you're of no worth to me

1030
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,140
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1031
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,760
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1032
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:22,620
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1033
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,460
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1034
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,660
He's ex-army.

1035
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:30,200
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1036
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,600
Go on.

1037
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,210
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1038
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,780
Recruitment for a single job.

1039
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,920
They like the wounded.

1040
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,680
Easier to use

1041
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,690
and then throw away
when you are done.

1042
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:55,080
Timmons, you, me...

1043
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:02,670
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1044
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:08,540
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1045
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:10,940
And the Archbishop?

1046
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:16,410
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1047
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,080
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1048
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,950
What was he going to say?

1049
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,320
The truth.

1050
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,980
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1051
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:31,590
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1052
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,690
Over there, and here.

1053
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,600
The problem isn't the doing.

1054
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,200
It's the people in power having to admit

1055
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:42,770
that they knew.

1056
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:47,340
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1057
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:49,610
and only the underlings go to jail.

1058
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:51,940
Their bosses knew.

1059
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:54,180
We know their bosses knew.

1060
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,510
But you don't say it.

1061
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,350
What exactly happened in Africa?

1062
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,950
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1063
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:02,090
that an oil pipeline

1064
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,460
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1065
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:09,000
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1066
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,070
Drink?

1067
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,230
So they asked them all nicely to move

1068
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,700
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1069
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:13,770
No.

1070
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:15,230
They didn't ask.

1071
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:16,970
They just killed them.

1072
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,040
All.

1073
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,280
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1074
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,710
They'll just go.

1075
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:38,760
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1076
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:42,560
men, women, children,

1077
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:47,300
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

1078
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:50,510
You should know.

1079
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:54,640
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1080
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,780
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

1081
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:09,090
Who runs Johnson?

1082
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,390
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1083
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:11,590
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1084
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,790
You don't get it.

1085
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:17,330
There is no head to cut off.

1086
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,300
It's a conglomerate.

1087
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,700
If one of them betrays the principles

1088
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,440
of the accrual of money and power,

1089
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:30,240
the others betray him.

1090
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:32,870
What it is

1091
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:37,450
is human weakness.

1092
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,730
You can't kill that with a gun.

1093
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,600
Swagger.

1094
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:51,690
Swagger.

1095
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,600
You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.

1096
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:58,500
Had to keep you till they got here.

1097
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:03,280
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1098
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,610
You would have known.

1099
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,890
By the way, they've got your woman.

1100
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,020
Swagger.

1101
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:21,590
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1102
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:25,270
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
- Roger that.

1103
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,000
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1104
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,030
You got to get out of there.

1105
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,610
- They're all over the place.
- Hey!

1106
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:04,610
Calm down.

1107
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:07,200
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1108
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:09,310
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1109
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:17,860
Listen very carefully.

1110
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,650
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1111
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,730
then the gas.

1112
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,520
Three, two, one...

1113
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:54,550
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1114
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:50,670
Swagger!

1115
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,220
You got it.

1116
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,730
Swagger!

1117
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:15,700
Swagger!

1118
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:17,740
Swagger!

1119
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:26,210
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1120
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,290
Okay.

1121
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:28,440
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1122
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:29,580
Go!

1123
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,030
Come on!

1124
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:03,720
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1125
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,990
What?

1126
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,020
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1127
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,460
Okay. Okay.

1128
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,430
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

1129
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,190
All right, go!

1130
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:28,100
Pull up! Pull up!

1131
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,150
Time to go!

1132
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:03,980
Let me take a look.

1133
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,380
Not right now.

1134
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,280
Morning, beautiful.

1135
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:09,620
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

1136
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:14,060
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1137
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,790
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

1138
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:21,130
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1139
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,370
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1140
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,240
of the FBl.

1141
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,060
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1142
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:36,870
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1143
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:40,480
what the fuck is going on?

1144
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:47,820
Great shot!

1145
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,890
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

1146
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,260
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1147
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,340
Think what you want.

1148
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:06,830
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1149
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:10,640
There's always a confused soul

1150
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,340
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1151
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,650
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1152
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:21,960
That's the hassle with democracy.

1153
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,490
Pull!

1154
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,780
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1155
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,440
We need those results now.

1156
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:43,880
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna!... to the roadhouse.

1157
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:46,580
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1158
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:49,850
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1159
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,180
Start a trace.

1160
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:53,680
Got it. I'm on it.

1161
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:56,020
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1162
01:37:56,290 --> 01:37:59,420
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1163
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:02,470
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1164
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:05,160
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1165
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,130
Got him.

1166
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:08,870
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1167
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:11,770
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1168
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:16,250
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1169
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:18,250
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1170
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,340
Why?

1171
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:21,440
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1172
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:24,720
- But we're the FBl, son.
- Yeah, I know.

1173
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,250
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1174
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,650
Oh, Nick, wait...

1175
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,660
Son of a bitch.

1176
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,790
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

1177
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:31,990
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

1178
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,330
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

1179
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,070
This is Swagger.

1180
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:42,870
- Colonel Johnson here.
- Figured you'd be listening.

1181
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:45,370
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
- Colonel?

1182
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:46,880
If it is 'Colonel'?

1183
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:48,440
It is.

1184
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:52,970
- I have something you want.
- Well, it seems so do I.

1185
01:38:56,050 --> 01:39:00,820
Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

1186
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:03,620
Men, women, children.

1187
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,730
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1188
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:08,300
I just want someone there I can trust.

1189
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,990
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1190
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,000
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1191
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:15,510
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

1192
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:17,600
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1193
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:21,040
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1194
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:24,640
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1195
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,410
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

1196
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,950
from Montana?

1197
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:31,890
Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?

1198
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,920
I don't think so.

1199
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:37,890
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1200
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,620
Point 732. Point 648.

1201
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:42,360
And what the hell is that?

1202
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:45,630
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few meters of latitude and longitude,

1203
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:47,730
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1204
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,170
with 400 bodies underneath.

1205
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,070
Where are we meeting?

1206
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:54,840
Somewhere I can see you,

1207
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:58,680
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1208
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:08,520
Where's your boy?

1209
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,530
Well, I'm here.

1210
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:34,370
He's here.

1211
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,780
Look, look, look.

1212
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:38,640
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1213
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,420
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1214
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,000
Okay.

1215
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:46,180
I think I broke a rib!

1216
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,010
Don't move!

1217
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:50,890
Is there anybody else?

1218
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:52,460
No.

1219
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:22,010
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1220
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,310
You got no shot!

1221
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:28,820
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1222
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,290
You got no shot!

1223
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:36,730
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1224
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:47,370
It's over for you, buddy!

1225
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:55,050
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1226
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:10,590
Not bad!

1227
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,900
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1228
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,470
Christ.

1229
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:35,420
How can we help you?

1230
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:37,690
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1231
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,590
to bring this by here at 3:00 p. m.

1232
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:44,460
Let's move!

1233
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,350
You all right?

1234
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,130
Yeah.

1235
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:27,480
Search him.

1236
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:29,140
I don't carry a weapon,

1237
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,380
ordinarily.

1238
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,080
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1239
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,390
Pull the pilot.

1240
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,090
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1241
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,360
Put your gun down!

1242
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:51,590
Easy. Easy.

1243
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:03,100
Sarah.

1244
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,780
Give me the gun.

1245
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,250
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1246
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,790
You okay?

1247
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,560
Put them up. Keep them up.

1248
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:23,220
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1249
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:26,900
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1250
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:29,270
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1251
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:30,340
You do, huh?

1252
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,470
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1253
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:37,140
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1254
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:39,010
just as a preamble?

1255
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,980
You got any plans after this?

1256
01:46:41,650 --> 01:46:46,090
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1257
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:48,390
Work? For you?

1258
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:52,260
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1259
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:55,920
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1260
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:58,090
And what side are you on?

1261
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,070
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1262
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:02,330
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1263
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,740
There's only haves and have-nots.

1264
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,830
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1265
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:11,440
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1266
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,380
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1267
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,470
so a pipeline could go through.

1268
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:16,180
One village!

1269
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:18,310
And it brought stability to the region.

1270
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:21,590
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1271
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,490
because their
grandmother's grandfather

1272
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,190
belonged to a different tribe.

1273
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,690
They like us down there, boy.

1274
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,830
This is a country

1275
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,770
where the Secretary of Defense

1276
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:43,540
can go on TV

1277
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,040
and tell the American public,

1278
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:49,880
oh, that 'This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!'

1279
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:52,620
And nobody questions him,

1280
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,160
because they don't want to hear
the answer

1281
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:55,590
because it's a lie!

1282
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:02,260
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1283
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:04,330
Now are you on the inside,

1284
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:05,970
or are you on the out?

1285
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,380
It's the FBl!

1286
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:16,810
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1287
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:22,920
If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...

1288
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,680
I don't think so, Senator.

1289
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:30,860
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

1290
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:33,420
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

1291
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:37,370
This stuffs plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1292
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:40,930
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1293
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,030
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1294
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:45,670
I'm out, old man!

1295
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,580
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1296
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:49,980
You happy?

1297
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:56,050
Where do you think you're going?

1298
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:57,590
Washington!

1299
01:48:57,690 --> 01:49:02,130
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. senator in the back?

1300
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:03,780
Lord knows I want to.

1301
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:06,100
I didn't think so.

1302
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:08,560
Let him go.

1303
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,230
They've got your rifle.

1304
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,270
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1305
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:17,030
Recovered at the site.

1306
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:27,040
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1307
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,010
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1308
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:32,610
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1309
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:38,960
I won.

1310
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,360
You lost.

1311
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:44,330
Get used to the idea, son.

1312
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,240
I'm not your son.

1313
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:03,150
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

1314
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:06,820
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBl!
Don't shoot!

1315
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,090
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

1316
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:10,720
I said get down!

1317
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,710
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

1318
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:34,440
Thank you, sir.

1319
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,580
Thanks for bringing her.

1320
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:45,760
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1321
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:48,160
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1322
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,530
This is Attorney General Russert.

1323
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:58,130
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

1324
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,570
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1325
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,840
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1326
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:05,180
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1327
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:09,480
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBl.

1328
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:11,050
What the hell am I doing here?

1329
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:13,380
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1330
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,260
Call the Joint Chief.

1331
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:18,190
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1332
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:20,660
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1333
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:23,230
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1334
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:24,820
telling me to let you go.

1335
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:28,030
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1336
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:30,440
and am, indeed, required by law,

1337
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,770
to tell them to fuck off.

1338
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,540
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1339
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:36,580
so you sit there and be quiet.

1340
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:42,210
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1341
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,450
Thank you.

1342
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:47,390
This is my weapon.

1343
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:49,820
No question about it, don't deny it.

1344
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:52,290
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1345
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,360
We agree?

1346
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:55,620
It's been in the FBl's possession
ever since,

1347
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:57,130
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1348
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,760
No. Absolutely not.

1349
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:01,000
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

1350
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:03,270
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1351
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:06,280
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1352
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:08,740
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1353
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,540
Definitely my gun.

1354
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:14,120
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1355
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,740
Nope. No, I don't.

1356
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:18,380
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

1357
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,920
- Trust me?
- Yep.

1358
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:21,180
Really trust me?

1359
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,530
Yeah.

1360
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,790
With your life?

1361
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,800
- Yep.
- Good.

1362
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:30,730
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

1363
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:33,670
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1364
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:35,260
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1365
01:52:35,370 --> 01:52:36,500
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

1366
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,130
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1367
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:46,310
I could keep doing this all day,

1368
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:48,640
with every weapon in my house.

1369
01:52:49,150 --> 01:52:52,210
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1370
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,350
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1371
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,190
But the gun don't shoot.

1372
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:58,590
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1373
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:00,460
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1374
01:53:00,570 --> 01:53:03,800
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1375
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,200
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1376
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:08,070
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1377
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:10,730
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1378
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:13,170
Whatever.

1379
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:15,410
Who gives a shit?

1380
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:18,210
Nice presentation.

1381
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,110
But none of it sticks to me.

1382
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,520
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1383
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:25,880
Done.

1384
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:27,320
I'll be seeing you.

1385
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:30,620
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1386
01:53:30,730 --> 01:53:31,920
Yeah, in this country.

1387
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,660
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1388
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:45,530
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1389
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:48,340
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1390
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:49,410
My God.

1391
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:50,810
Look around you.

1392
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,510
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1393
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:55,180
That's all hearsay.

1394
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:57,910
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1395
01:53:58,020 --> 01:53:59,460
And I'm free to go.

1396
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:01,890
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1397
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:05,930
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1398
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:08,160
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1399
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,690
these events occurred
in another country,

1400
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,100
outside of our laws.

1401
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,730
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1402
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,860
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1403
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:20,040
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1404
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:22,810
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1405
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:26,440
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1406
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,550
I win.

1407
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:32,880
You lose.

1408
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,590
Again.

1409
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,520
This is ridiculous.

1410
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:04,380
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1411
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:06,990
But this is the world we live in.

1412
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:10,030
And justice does not always prevail.

1413
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,090
It's not the Wild West,

1414
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:13,490
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1415
01:55:14,830 --> 01:55:17,670
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1416
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:24,840
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1417
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,780
Unshackle the sergeant.

1418
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:36,350
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1419
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:37,720
In the face.

1420
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:41,350
You heard that expression,

1421
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:43,760
'You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind'?

1422
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:50,960
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1423
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:56,370
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1424
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:59,880
'This is about evidence and the truth!'

1425
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:02,500
And then you just said to him,

1426
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:03,910
'Fuck you!'

1427
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,380
'Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G.'

1428
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:10,950
'Fuck you!

1429
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:15,160
'The truth is what I say it is!'

1430
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:24,570
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1431
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:26,430
You're going to Ecuador.

1432
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:33,500
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1433
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:37,170
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralize the problem, but...

1434
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:39,140
Well, they've requested you.

1435
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,280
It's solvable.

1436
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,150
They requested you...

1437
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:49,520
Swagger.

1438
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,460
Turn off the lights!

1439
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,060
Get my car.

1440
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:05,370
Get my car.

1441
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,200
Do something.

1442
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,230
Do something!

1443
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:37,670
Where is he?

1444
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:51,480
He's under the floor!

1445
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:23,880
You don't need to kill me.

1446
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,850
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1447
01:58:27,290 --> 01:58:28,260
It was them.

1448
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:33,830
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1449
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:38,430
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1450
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:44,170
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

1451
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,110
I am a United States senator!

1452
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:48,280
Exactly.
