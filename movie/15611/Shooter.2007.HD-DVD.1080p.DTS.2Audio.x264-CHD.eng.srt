1
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,367
Movement.

2
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,756
Two men.

3
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,796
Approximately

4
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,036
40 goats.

5
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:17,866
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:19,966
Egress?

7
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:25,546
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,046
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:42,896
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,466
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,936
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,376
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:54,876
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:58,876
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:12,556
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,826
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:15,126
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,566
Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.

19
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:22,296
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

20
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:25,896
Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.

21
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:27,916
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

22
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:30,346
I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.

23
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,886
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

24
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,816
Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

25
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:39,286
possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.

26
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,586
Call them out.

27
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:42,026
Target.

28
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:44,526
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:46,896
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:47,966
Range it.

31
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,266
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,676
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,876
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,606
On target.

35
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,046
Hold scope.

36
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,486
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,116
Hit.

38
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:20,956
Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.

39
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:24,466
Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.

40
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,176
Call it in. It's time to go.

41
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:39,186
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

42
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:40,306
- Packing up.
- Shit!

43
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,786
Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.

44
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:46,216
Weren't supposed to be
hostiles that close!

45
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:57,636
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

46
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:06,666
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

47
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,106
Fire when ready.

48
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:16,216
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.

49
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:19,416
- I see it, Donnie. I see it.
- Fire when ready.

50
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,596
- They don't know where we are.
- But they might get lucky!

51
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:35,066
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

52
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,436
Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.

53
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,276
Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.

54
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:44,276
We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.

55
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,456
Command Post, do you read me?

56
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,786
Shut it down.

57
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:51,026
They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:53,886
eight kilometers inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:56,326
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

60
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:57,896
Radio check. Do you read me?

61
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:00,056
- Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
- Do you read me?

62
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,826
- Pull out those tracks.
- Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

63
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,806
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

64
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,046
Call it in!

65
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,186
Shit! The channel's down!

66
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:25,316
That's impossible!

67
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,826
The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,756
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:12,596
Donnie?

70
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:16,436
Donnie!

71
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,496
Come on, boy!

72
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,526
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:53,466
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:54,596
Come on.

75
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,796
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:56,976
What?

77
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:00,166
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:03,916
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:18,586
Good boy.

80
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:27,206
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,166
Here, boy.

82
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:34,806
Good boy.

83
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,856
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,456
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,926
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:56,626
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,036
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:03,576
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,506
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:07,876
No official report.

91
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:12,216
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:14,406
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:17,686
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:19,686
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:21,556
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,756
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,196
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:39,506
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:43,746
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:47,546
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

101
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:51,056
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,486
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:04,866
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:21,646
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:25,446
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,726
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,856
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,526
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,896
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,526
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,836
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:39,496
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:40,696
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,676
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

115
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:48,176
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,766
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,316
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,236
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

119
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:56,686
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:57,916
He understands.

121
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,946
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,186
Slowly.

123
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,426
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,396
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,896
You know what that is?

126
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,936
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

127
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:19,036
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,176
Yours?

129
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,876
Yeah.

130
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,966
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,606
What did you do?

132
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:29,446
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,316
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,516
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:38,356
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:43,996
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,126
Whose president?

138
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,256
Ours.

139
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,266
I didn't say 'execute'.

140
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,006
Plan.

141
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,866
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:57,606
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:01,046
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:04,716
It was internal.

145
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,186
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:10,126
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:15,686
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:20,296
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:23,236
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:26,166
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:30,946
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:34,036
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,906
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:41,416
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,926
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,356
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,366
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,306
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:55,996
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:59,106
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,736
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,936
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,376
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

164
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,576
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:10,776
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,116
President'll be wearing body amour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,386
at over a mile.

168
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,756
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,086
Yes.

170
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:20,566
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,036
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,896
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,966
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:28,976
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,936
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,776
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:35,316
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,176
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,286
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,046
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:47,826
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:49,586
against all enemies,

183
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,326
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:53,366
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,366
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,576
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,076
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:14,846
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,716
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,306
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,676
The truck.

192
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,646
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:48,306
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

194
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:52,116
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,786
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:57,116
This is beautiful.

197
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:04,366
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,166
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:14,576
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,206
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,646
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,236
This is our guy.

203
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,746
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,286
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:41,226
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:45,696
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,126
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,616
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:40,746
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.

210
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:42,116
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,366
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,286
Okay.

213
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,456
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,266
Yeah.

215
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,586
This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.

216
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:24,526
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,426
Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.

218
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:45,176
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,186
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,416
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,646
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:55,056
...both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

223
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:57,316
were debated and signed here.

224
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:06,896
Out of the three cities,

225
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:09,936
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

226
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:11,836
There was no room in Baltimore.

227
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,376
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

228
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:15,236
buildings are in the way.

229
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:16,866
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

230
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:18,046
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

231
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,106
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

232
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,236
waiting for him in the afterlife,

233
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:21,876
I'd rule that out.

234
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:23,116
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

235
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:25,826
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

236
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,386
It's one of six possible locations,

237
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,426
approximately five stories
above the President's location.

238
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:33,656
Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.

239
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:34,996
They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,

240
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:36,626
several lines into his speech.

241
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:39,536
That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.

242
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:41,576
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

243
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,436
Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

244
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:45,836
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

245
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:46,966
touch more slippery.

246
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:48,566
Least that's what I'd do.

247
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:51,016
You can kill him from that far away?

248
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,986
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

249
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:56,276
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

250
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:58,086
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

251
00:21:58,686 --> 00:21:59,956
The challenge is the wind.

252
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,926
Lightest breeze uncorrected
at that distance

253
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:03,326
is enough to ruin the shot.

254
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:06,626
He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.

255
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,216
Velocity corrections are easy,

256
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:10,126
but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.

257
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,206
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

258
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:15,276
Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.

259
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,436
Impressive recon and report, son.

260
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,566
Move too soon, we lose him.

261
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:21,976
We want to take him alive.

262
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:25,606
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

263
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:31,186
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

264
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:33,886
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

265
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:35,116
A moment?

266
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:39,766
You've done your country
a great service, son.

267
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:40,856
- On the day...
- Look...

268
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,026
Listen.

269
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:46,436
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

270
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,266
I could use a spotter.

271
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,076
Thank you, Philadelphia.

272
00:23:58,176 --> 00:24:00,266
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

273
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:02,006
...before you on this stage...

274
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:04,776
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

275
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:07,976
...patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,

276
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:09,846
the Declaration of Independence...

277
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,076
Sir?

278
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:12,816
...and a country,
the United States of America,

279
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,356
that changed the world.

280
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,786
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

281
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,696
Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.

282
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,556
Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

283
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,156
All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.

284
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,666
- Stand by.
- Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

285
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,036
Copy that.

286
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:39,516
Post 18 clear, over.

287
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:42,246
Post 19, please report.
What's your status?

288
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:45,686
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

289
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:48,226
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

290
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,816
The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

291
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:53,586
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

292
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:56,256
There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop

293
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:59,526
as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.

294
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:02,006
He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony

295
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:03,436
to discuss these matters.

296
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,836
These are great times.

297
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,076
These are historic times.

298
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,476
And these are troubled times, as well.

299
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:16,616
This medal that your country...

300
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,946
Yellow ribbons.

301
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:20,616
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

302
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,956
No, they tie those low around trees.

303
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:25,226
These are windage flags.

304
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:26,896
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

305
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,486
for a shot from the steeple.

306
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:30,866
Yeah. Maybe.

307
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,026
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

308
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:35,066
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

309
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:38,006
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

310
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:41,776
...raises its head
and confronts freedom,

311
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:47,216
but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.

312
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:51,016
And it is our responsibility

313
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:53,356
to find these dark weeds.

314
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:58,116
Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

315
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,196
- If you just joined us...
- Hi.

316
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:04,926
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

317
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:07,536
Bob Lee Swagger.

318
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,406
It is a real honor to meet you.

319
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:14,206
You're unsnapped, officer.

320
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,666
Shit. Oh, fuck.

321
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,046
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

322
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:22,646
Again, it's an honor.

323
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:30,616
...of our stewardship of this great...

324
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:34,256
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

325
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:36,626
He's getting a medal. Know it?

326
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,826
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

327
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:40,906
You know I worked there?

328
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:42,806
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

329
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:44,836
when you shoot a civilian, right?

330
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,236
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

331
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:48,816
That's very original.

332
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:52,186
Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.

333
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,776
The President speaks next.

334
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,146
All teams stand by.

335
00:26:57,626 --> 00:27:01,576
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.

336
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,356
Agent James, all clear.

337
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,486
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

338
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:07,526
- Got wind at three, full value.
- ... to introduce to you

339
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,596
the President of the United States.

340
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,796
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

341
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,766
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

342
00:27:38,326 --> 00:27:40,026
He's loaded.

343
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:44,066
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

344
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,766
In the city that was the capital of...

345
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,336
We got to take him.

346
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:50,906
Ten seconds.

347
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:53,666
Wind matches his setup.
Take him! Take him now!

348
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:55,176
Send in the ERT team. Take out the...

349
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,276
Shots fired! Shots fired!

350
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,866
Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.

351
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,056
- What? Flashlight down?
- I say again. Flashlight is down.

352
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,196
- The President has been shot.
- There's mass confusion...

353
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:24,436
Has the President been shot?

354
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,306
Right at the church steeple.

355
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:33,106
How could you miss?

356
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,676
How could you fucking miss?

357
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:38,946
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

358
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:40,646
He's bleeding. Kill him.

359
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:44,686
Command Post to Condor Two,
load up, over.

360
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:46,266
Condor Two loading up.

361
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,926
Go, go, go, go, go!

362
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:59,206
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

363
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,026
Condor Two, this is Command Post.
Stand by for update, over.

364
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,486
Standing by, over.

365
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,556
Command Post!

366
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:21,996
Command Post!
Command Post, this is Post 19.

367
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,126
You guys read me?

368
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:24,296
- Should I hold post?
- Please.

369
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:26,666
Please help me. Please. They shot me.

370
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,036
- FBl. Put your hands up!
- Please. Hey.

371
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:32,246
Save me.

372
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:34,346
What?

373
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:43,916
Give me the keys.

374
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,686
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

375
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:49,416
Help!

376
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:53,256
FBl! Took my weapon and my car.

377
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:00,866
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

378
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:04,806
CP, 17, can you repeat
possible suspect description?

379
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:06,936
Negative, no further at this time.

380
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:09,566
CP, this is 15.
No activity at my location.

381
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,736
I am available to move if necessary.

382
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,176
Copy that.

383
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:19,316
This is Officer Timmons
requesting backup.

384
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,356
Pursuing suspect in assassination.

385
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:25,586
Now fleeing in stolen FBl vehicle,
moving south on Front from Diamond.

386
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:27,326
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
I repeat,

387
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:29,556
suspect is armed and dangerous.

388
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,036
All Philly PD units be advised,

389
00:30:32,136 --> 00:30:35,036
assassination suspect is fleeing
in a stolen FBl vehicle.

390
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:37,836
He is going south
on Front from Diamond.

391
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,906
This is Condor 2. We are transitioning
from roadhouse to Front Street.

392
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:43,206
Please advise for further description
of suspect vehicle.

393
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:46,616
Dispatch, 419,
I'm heading south on Thompson.

394
00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:48,776
Do we have a color,
anything on the vehicle?

395
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:57,056
Assassination suspect's vehicle

396
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,996
is one government-issue
black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.

397
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:06,766
Pennsylvania license number
7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.

398
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:09,996
What was suspect's
last known location? Over.

399
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:12,306
Last known is south on Front.

400
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:22,146
This is Agent James. Do we have
multiple suspects or a single suspect?

401
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:26,746
Agent James, negative.
No further information...

402
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:30,486
This is Agent Pittman.
Car seen going high speed on Castor.

403
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:32,656
High speed on Castor. Be advised.

404
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:40,626
Timmons called it in?

405
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:42,966
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

406
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:44,806
- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

407
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,636
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

408
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:48,866
it doesn't really matter.

409
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:52,936
They're going to find him lying dead
by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.

410
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:54,086
What is your location?

411
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:08,526
Suspect vehicle a black sedan,
four-door...

412
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,506
All units be advised,

413
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:29,056
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle
entering High-Tech Car Wash

414
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,986
on the northwest corner
of Girard and 9th, over.

415
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,056
Command Post be advised,

416
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:35,586
this is Condor Two en route
to suspect location, over.

417
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:38,186
Command Post, Condor Three copies.
All en route.

418
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:44,666
- Yo, man!
- Watch it, man!

419
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,046
Shit!

420
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:25,696
Command Post, Condors Two
and Three moving to intercept, over.

421
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:01,066
Suspect vehicle collided with a truck
under the 95.

422
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:02,976
He's at Market and Columbus.

423
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:08,316
Looks good. Vehicle is disabled.
Repeat, vehicle disabled.

424
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,316
Take him down! Fire!

425
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:48,686
I got a Crown Vic. Black.
Government plates.

426
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,886
Dead guy in the front seat?

427
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:58,496
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

428
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:00,666
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

429
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:25,016
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

430
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:27,696
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

431
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:10,836
The would-be assassin,
tentatively identified

432
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:14,426
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

433
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:19,096
is being pursued by thousands of State
and Federal law enforcement personnel

434
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,406
as we speak.

435
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:24,246
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

436
00:37:24,346 --> 00:37:26,646
Nothing but an abandoned car
has been found

437
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,616
at the bottom of the Delaware River.

438
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:32,346
Seven-year veteran Philadelphia
police officer Stanley Timmons,

439
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,946
first to respond to the scene,

440
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:37,046
is believed to have shot
and injured Swagger.

441
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:39,326
Early reports indicate that the assailant

442
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,426
may have been hit
as many as two times.

443
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:45,266
Meanwhile, the FBl has been
unwilling to comment

444
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:47,666
on information that an agent of theirs

445
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,896
was assaulted and disarmed
by Swagger as he fled the scene,

446
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:54,476
possibly in a stolen FBl vehicle.

447
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:58,106
At this time, no sign of Swagger
has been found.

448
00:37:58,216 --> 00:38:00,276
You have embarrassed this office.

449
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:04,786
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

450
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:05,876
Sir...

451
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,186
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

452
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:11,226
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

453
00:38:11,326 --> 00:38:14,226
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

454
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,496
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

455
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:27,446
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

456
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:28,906
Because he didn't.

457
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:35,646
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

458
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:37,086
He never said that.

459
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:39,316
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

460
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:40,916
You got your ass kicked.

461
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:42,426
You're misremembering.

462
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:45,256
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

463
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,166
Have you given
your official statement yet?

464
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:51,256
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

465
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:55,536
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

466
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,806
Can you believe this fucking guy?

467
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:01,406
There you go.

468
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:03,266
- Yes?
- The raw feeds are in

469
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:04,276
from the networks.

470
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:26,226
...development, security camera footage
from Washington, D.C.

471
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:28,306
and several locations in Philadelphia

472
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:31,636
shows the suspect,
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,

473
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:35,696
scouting shooting locations,
traveling and taking wind readings.

474
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:40,676
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

475
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:11,476
Excuse me.

476
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:14,676
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

477
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:17,016
Please. I got cash,
and you can keep the change.

478
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:18,846
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

479
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:21,426
Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

480
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:22,996
couple bottles of water.

481
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:24,916
How many?

482
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:13,996
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:16,606
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

484
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:19,546
but we don't take care
of those things here.

485
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,706
- Yeah. Okay, well...
- The FBl released a video letter...

486
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,846
- ... see a counselor.
- ... threatening the life of the President...

487
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:24,976
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

488
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:27,356
...signed and dated
by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

489
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:30,056
Federal agents today
executed a search warrant

490
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,356
in the Wind River range of Wyoming

491
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:35,366
where Swagger had been living
for several years.

492
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:38,866
In the meantime, the FBl
has been unwilling to comment,

493
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:41,296
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

494
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:44,606
- Get anything?
- No.

495
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:48,066
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

496
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:01,606
And? Yes?

497
00:43:01,716 --> 00:43:04,876
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

498
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:06,316
- What'd he buy?
- Gotta be.

499
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:09,416
Salt, sugar, water,
and a marinade injector.

500
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:10,886
Guy going to a barbecue.

501
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:13,586
Salt, water, an injector could be used
for an IV,

502
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:14,756
but what's with the sugar?

503
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:16,126
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

504
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:17,826
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

505
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:18,906
for hundreds of years.

506
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:21,236
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

507
00:43:21,336 --> 00:43:23,776
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

508
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:26,346
You go into Howard's office
with the Napoleonic War,

509
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:27,636
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

510
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:29,976
Go back to your desk.
I'm saving your life.

511
00:43:51,936 --> 00:43:52,906
One thing is...

512
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:00,866
...1790 to 1800.

513
00:44:02,216 --> 00:44:03,176
One thing is...

514
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:20,786
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

515
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,326
I know who you are.

516
00:45:22,426 --> 00:45:25,296
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

517
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:28,026
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

518
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,226
I know.

519
00:45:29,336 --> 00:45:30,316
You do?

520
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,956
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

521
00:45:36,006 --> 00:45:38,566
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

522
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:40,436
Look, you're a nurse, right?

523
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:45,136
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

524
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:46,446
I teach the third grade.

525
00:45:47,146 --> 00:45:48,746
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

526
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:49,946
Please.

527
00:45:50,156 --> 00:45:51,206
Please?

528
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:53,546
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

529
00:45:54,156 --> 00:45:55,126
I swear.

530
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:57,856
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

531
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,486
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

532
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:06,666
You still figuring on shooting me?

533
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:09,566
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

534
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:12,796
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

535
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:14,876
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

536
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:21,846
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

537
00:46:21,956 --> 00:46:23,476
You'd best call me Sarah.

538
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:24,776
All right.

539
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:42,266
911, what's your emergency?

540
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:11,986
Hello?

541
00:47:12,106 --> 00:47:13,936
This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.

542
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:16,566
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over
the trash cans

543
00:47:16,676 --> 00:47:19,166
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

544
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:20,246
Okay, then.

545
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:29,516
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

546
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:31,676
they call you back right away.

547
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:40,296
I should've come
and seen you in person.

548
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,696
Before. I mean, then.

549
00:47:45,806 --> 00:47:47,166
Yeah, I read the letter.

550
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,536
It was okay.

551
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:54,806
And once a year I got the flowers.

552
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:58,836
You don't look real good.

553
00:48:00,286 --> 00:48:04,146
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

554
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,226
Why aren't you?

555
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:08,686
Well, the U.S. government spent
a lot of time and money

556
00:48:08,796 --> 00:48:10,586
teaching me how not to die

557
00:48:10,696 --> 00:48:13,186
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

558
00:48:14,566 --> 00:48:16,896
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

559
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:22,366
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

560
00:48:22,476 --> 00:48:23,436
Yeah.

561
00:48:33,386 --> 00:48:35,376
You got to try to spread it out.

562
00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:37,846
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

563
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:49,076
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

564
00:48:52,986 --> 00:48:54,616
Mileage can be rough.

565
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:07,766
No one ever beats me in.

566
00:49:15,146 --> 00:49:16,406
You never left.

567
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:19,436
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

568
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:22,676
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

569
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:26,216
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

570
00:49:27,586 --> 00:49:29,716
Where did all this stuff come from?

571
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:33,516
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

572
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:37,526
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

573
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:42,036
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

574
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:44,936
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

575
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:46,666
You need to get some sleep.

576
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,536
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

577
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:51,476
22 minutes after the shooting.

578
00:49:51,576 --> 00:49:52,606
We're good at our jobs.

579
00:49:52,716 --> 00:49:55,186
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

580
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:56,406
The scene was locked down.

581
00:49:57,756 --> 00:50:01,016
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

582
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:02,216
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

583
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,656
We're not that good at our jobs.

584
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:06,116
- You want to see something?
- Probably not.

585
00:50:06,226 --> 00:50:07,596
I downloaded this.

586
00:50:07,696 --> 00:50:08,826
This is a full-scale printout

587
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:11,926
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

588
00:50:12,036 --> 00:50:15,296
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

589
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:20,136
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

590
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:21,436
Five shots,

591
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:23,006
at 1,000 yards,

592
00:50:23,246 --> 00:50:25,506
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

593
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:29,376
It was the capital of the United States...

594
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:33,016
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

595
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,556
This is the wind speed and direction

596
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,916
according to the
National Weather Service

597
00:50:36,026 --> 00:50:38,326
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

598
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,056
Now, how does a man who can do that

599
00:50:41,896 --> 00:50:45,126
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

600
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:46,926
I don't get it.

601
00:50:47,036 --> 00:50:49,866
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

602
00:50:49,976 --> 00:50:52,096
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

603
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:54,436
He said he was walking foot patrol,

604
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:57,136
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

605
00:50:57,246 --> 00:51:00,076
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

606
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:02,086
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

607
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:04,946
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

608
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:07,256
It doesn't make any sense.

609
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,156
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

610
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:13,356
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

611
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:16,956
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

612
00:51:21,066 --> 00:51:23,126
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

613
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:25,636
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

614
00:51:25,736 --> 00:51:27,736
Bad things happen to good people.

615
00:51:27,846 --> 00:51:28,866
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

616
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:37,316
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

617
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:40,486
But it'll cut loose again.

618
00:51:40,586 --> 00:51:43,886
I held off the worst of the infection,
but you're gonna have to open it up,

619
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:46,786
cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

620
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,766
working your way out,
sewing it together

621
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:52,666
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

622
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:56,536
You ready for this?

623
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:01,566
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s
and pass out.

624
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,076
Good luck, okay?

625
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:23,456
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

626
00:53:23,556 --> 00:53:24,986
That our guy in the collar?

627
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:26,316
Whose president?

628
00:53:26,426 --> 00:53:27,826
I didn't say 'execute'.

629
00:53:27,926 --> 00:53:30,826
He's getting a medal. Know it?

630
00:53:30,936 --> 00:53:33,166
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

631
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:39,066
You need to find the shooter.

632
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:43,376
No.

633
00:55:36,726 --> 00:55:39,356
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

634
00:55:39,456 --> 00:55:40,856
Find me something.

635
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:43,126
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

636
00:55:44,336 --> 00:55:45,996
He's not dead.

637
00:55:47,836 --> 00:55:49,236
Tear apart his life.

638
00:55:49,336 --> 00:55:50,666
Again.

639
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:56,936
Go okay?

640
00:56:02,286 --> 00:56:03,646
I've been hallucinating.

641
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:08,586
Something I need to tell you.

642
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,656
Ralphie's dead.

643
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:14,986
Who's Ralphie?

644
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:17,566
Well, they said you shot your dog

645
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,566
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

646
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:21,136
They said that, huh?

647
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:26,976
Name was Sam.

648
00:56:28,076 --> 00:56:30,546
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

649
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:35,806
You okay?

650
00:56:37,786 --> 00:56:38,756
No.

651
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:41,616
What are you gonna do?

652
00:56:43,086 --> 00:56:44,756
I'll get better.

653
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:49,116
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

654
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:26,096
Can I help you?

655
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,226
Hold still.

656
00:58:07,846 --> 00:58:09,706
I been meaning to ask you.

657
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:12,106
You have a boyfriend?

658
00:58:14,146 --> 00:58:15,176
Why?

659
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:18,976
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

660
00:58:19,086 --> 00:58:20,746
It's been three years.

661
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:21,826
No.

662
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:23,826
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

663
00:58:23,926 --> 00:58:25,086
walks through that door
without knocking,

664
00:58:25,196 --> 00:58:27,126
wondering where you've been.

665
00:58:29,396 --> 00:58:30,986
Well, no.

666
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:33,326
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

667
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,126
Not bad.

668
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:02,056
A little stiff, but...

669
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:04,836
Hey.

670
00:59:06,066 --> 00:59:08,766
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

671
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:11,866
That was really brave, what you did.

672
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:13,396
You saved my life.

673
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:20,106
I'm better. I better get to it.

674
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:22,546
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

675
00:59:23,646 --> 00:59:24,746
Never.

676
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:28,186
They're never gonna stop looking.

677
00:59:30,056 --> 00:59:33,326
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

678
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:34,916
I'm going to give them him.

679
00:59:35,026 --> 00:59:36,496
Excuse me?

680
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:40,756
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

681
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:51,146
- Swagger?
- Hey.

682
01:00:00,956 --> 01:00:03,686
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

683
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:08,866
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

684
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:11,396
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

685
01:00:11,496 --> 01:00:12,556
You sure?

686
01:00:13,806 --> 01:00:14,766
Yeah.

687
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:20,476
Why'd you go?

688
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:23,006
When they came to see you.

689
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,576
They know which buttons to press.

690
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,476
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

691
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:34,176
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
'Which way you want me to go, boss?'

692
01:00:34,286 --> 01:00:37,916
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

693
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:40,656
You know, I got a plan,

694
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,356
but I think I'm going to need your help.

695
01:00:44,536 --> 01:00:46,466
Okay. I'll do it.

696
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,496
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

697
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:51,196
I know.

698
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:00,176
Look.

699
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:02,486
It was my fault.

700
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,256
What?

701
01:01:09,826 --> 01:01:11,986
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

702
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:20,056
What?

703
01:01:25,236 --> 01:01:26,866
Don't you dare.

704
01:01:28,906 --> 01:01:31,966
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

705
01:01:33,016 --> 01:01:36,746
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

706
01:01:36,846 --> 01:01:37,946
He knew exactly what he was doing

707
01:01:38,056 --> 01:01:40,816
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

708
01:01:42,556 --> 01:01:44,486
He loved what he did.

709
01:01:44,596 --> 01:01:46,556
No one made him do it.

710
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,126
That ain't yours to carry.

711
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:55,666
You're right.

712
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:58,706
I'm sorry I tried.

713
01:02:24,596 --> 01:02:25,856
It's okay.

714
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:34,136
I need you to meet with this FBl agent.

715
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:37,006
Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.

716
01:02:37,106 --> 01:02:41,106
Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.

717
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,686
You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.

718
01:02:43,986 --> 01:02:45,576
You get caught, I get caught.

719
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:47,246
You know what that is?

720
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:51,756
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

721
01:02:51,856 --> 01:02:53,156
Well, he's been staying with me.

722
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:55,316
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

723
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:08,026
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

724
01:03:08,146 --> 01:03:09,736
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

725
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:13,076
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

726
01:03:14,316 --> 01:03:17,216
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

727
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:50,046
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

728
01:04:15,746 --> 01:04:17,646
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

729
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:27,216
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

730
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:28,486
and show me some ID.

731
01:04:32,596 --> 01:04:34,186
I'm not gonna ask you again.

732
01:04:35,596 --> 01:04:37,356
Take your hat off, asshole!

733
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:49,306
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

734
01:05:22,646 --> 01:05:23,866
Hey, how's it going?

735
01:05:25,676 --> 01:05:26,876
Hey, John.

736
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:51,596
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

737
01:05:51,706 --> 01:05:53,636
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

738
01:05:56,106 --> 01:05:59,276
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

739
01:05:59,616 --> 01:06:05,316
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

740
01:06:05,416 --> 01:06:07,406
in 45 minutes for a review.

741
01:06:07,526 --> 01:06:10,546
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

742
01:06:11,756 --> 01:06:13,726
What do you think?

743
01:06:14,426 --> 01:06:16,866
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

744
01:06:16,966 --> 01:06:19,296
already edited together
to show the angles.

745
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,496
Who delivered them?

746
01:06:20,596 --> 01:06:24,006
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

747
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:26,076
They denied, which is a...

748
01:06:28,676 --> 01:06:31,836
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

749
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,776
Of what?

750
01:06:33,876 --> 01:06:37,406
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

751
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:38,646
Oh, come on, just tell me.

752
01:06:38,756 --> 01:06:40,246
You don't want to be here
for that review.

753
01:06:40,356 --> 01:06:43,916
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

754
01:06:52,766 --> 01:06:56,496
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

755
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:00,836
- Thank you.
- Go.

756
01:07:08,016 --> 01:07:10,006
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

757
01:07:10,116 --> 01:07:13,206
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

758
01:07:13,316 --> 01:07:15,786
We just traced it to a donut shop
with free WiFi.

759
01:07:15,886 --> 01:07:18,656
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

760
01:07:18,756 --> 01:07:21,556
out of the FBl field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

761
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:24,256
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the donut shop

762
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:26,886
only three blocks away
from the field office.

763
01:07:26,996 --> 01:07:30,056
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

764
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,366
He lives in Philly.

765
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:33,036
And he works for the FBl.

766
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:35,676
Nicholas Memphis.

767
01:07:36,106 --> 01:07:39,566
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

768
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:42,516
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

769
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:44,416
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

770
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:45,506
They're definitely not government,

771
01:07:45,616 --> 01:07:48,346
but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.

772
01:07:48,456 --> 01:07:49,646
These are contractors.

773
01:07:49,756 --> 01:07:52,246
I can't tell
what this company does, but...

774
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:55,116
Hey.

775
01:07:55,226 --> 01:07:56,196
Hey, hey, hey!

776
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,366
Memphis?

777
01:08:02,466 --> 01:08:03,436
Memphis!

778
01:08:10,676 --> 01:08:12,546
For a man who didn't know much,

779
01:08:12,646 --> 01:08:15,946
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

780
01:08:16,046 --> 01:08:17,646
Get him some water.

781
01:08:26,796 --> 01:08:27,856
Good.

782
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,636
Got to pee yet?

783
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:41,606
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

784
01:08:41,706 --> 01:08:44,006
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

785
01:08:44,106 --> 01:08:46,376
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

786
01:08:46,476 --> 01:08:48,416
I'm not going to shoot myself.

787
01:08:49,246 --> 01:08:50,346
Sure you will.

788
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:52,816
Take him out. Get him ready.

789
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:53,886
No!

790
01:08:59,626 --> 01:09:00,756
That's my gun.

791
01:09:00,856 --> 01:09:01,886
Yeah.

792
01:09:02,426 --> 01:09:04,866
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

793
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:07,296
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

794
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:15,896
Quit your struggling.

795
01:09:19,516 --> 01:09:23,316
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

796
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:29,516
Russo. Russo!

797
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:31,246
Davis, get out here!

798
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:38,226
What is the goddamn hold-up?

799
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:19,036
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

800
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:20,236
Kill you?

801
01:10:20,336 --> 01:10:22,966
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

802
01:10:24,206 --> 01:10:27,006
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

803
01:10:35,256 --> 01:10:38,486
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

804
01:10:39,796 --> 01:10:41,916
Help me toss these boys in the water?

805
01:10:42,026 --> 01:10:44,326
You set me up and you used me as bait!

806
01:10:44,436 --> 01:10:47,266
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

807
01:10:47,366 --> 01:10:48,396
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

808
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:50,596
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

809
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:52,936
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

810
01:10:53,036 --> 01:10:54,976
They can work out some kind of deal.

811
01:10:55,946 --> 01:10:58,806
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

812
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:00,036
I don't think you understand.

813
01:11:00,146 --> 01:11:01,336
These boys killed my dog.

814
01:11:04,246 --> 01:11:07,186
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

815
01:11:07,286 --> 01:11:08,846
In the end, the law is all...

816
01:11:08,956 --> 01:11:11,656
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

817
01:11:11,756 --> 01:11:13,056
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

818
01:11:13,156 --> 01:11:15,686
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

819
01:11:15,926 --> 01:11:17,086
And I'll be dead.

820
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:19,136
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

821
01:11:19,236 --> 01:11:21,326
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

822
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:24,666
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

823
01:11:24,776 --> 01:11:27,266
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

824
01:11:30,546 --> 01:11:31,906
You know, I missed a meeting today

825
01:11:32,016 --> 01:11:35,466
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

826
01:11:35,586 --> 01:11:38,576
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

827
01:11:43,226 --> 01:11:44,626
I'll take his legs.

828
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:46,386
It's a good call, Pork.

829
01:11:46,956 --> 01:11:49,756
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBl agent

830
01:11:49,866 --> 01:11:51,656
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

831
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,736
No.

832
01:11:53,466 --> 01:11:57,366
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

833
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:00,506
With a.22.

834
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:04,706
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

835
01:12:04,816 --> 01:12:06,246
And that young kid,

836
01:12:06,546 --> 01:12:08,066
FBl Agent

837
01:12:10,546 --> 01:12:11,746
Nick Memphis,

838
01:12:11,856 --> 01:12:15,656
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

839
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:19,486
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

840
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:22,626
What?

841
01:12:22,726 --> 01:12:24,886
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

842
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:29,026
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

843
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:31,636
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

844
01:12:31,736 --> 01:12:34,906
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

845
01:12:35,006 --> 01:12:36,206
She went back to using
her maiden name,

846
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:38,536
which is why we missed it the first time.

847
01:12:39,716 --> 01:12:41,476
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

848
01:12:41,586 --> 01:12:43,636
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

849
01:12:43,746 --> 01:12:47,156
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

850
01:12:47,256 --> 01:12:48,916
It's just within driving range.

851
01:12:49,886 --> 01:12:52,586
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

852
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,066
We've given Swagger a new war,

853
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:03,966
he's found a new spotter.

854
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:06,966
This is about to get worse.

855
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:37,696
I think we're here.

856
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:40,066
Hey. Swagger.

857
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:45,906
I think we're here.

858
01:13:49,016 --> 01:13:51,146
Welcome to Tennessee.

859
01:13:51,256 --> 01:13:53,376
Patron state of shooting stuff.

860
01:13:55,656 --> 01:13:57,086
Hey, who is this guy?

861
01:13:57,186 --> 01:14:00,716
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

862
01:14:00,826 --> 01:14:02,886
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

863
01:14:02,996 --> 01:14:04,056
than Smith % Wesson.

864
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,656
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

865
01:14:06,766 --> 01:14:07,926
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

866
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:11,626
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

867
01:14:11,936 --> 01:14:13,026
Wisdom.

868
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,706
You come to the wrong place.

869
01:14:16,806 --> 01:14:18,076
Maybe.

870
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:19,766
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

871
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:21,536
and have it match exactly to another.

872
01:14:21,646 --> 01:14:23,016
Could that be done?

873
01:14:23,116 --> 01:14:24,136
Take a seat.

874
01:14:25,016 --> 01:14:26,246
Have a chair, son.

875
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:34,486
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

876
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:36,086
could make the grooves match.

877
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:38,526
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

878
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:40,156
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

879
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:41,826
was completely mangled on impact.

880
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,166
FBl match was metallurgical.

881
01:14:44,266 --> 01:14:45,426
Thank you, Mother.

882
01:14:45,536 --> 01:14:47,936
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

883
01:14:48,046 --> 01:14:50,536
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

884
01:14:53,476 --> 01:14:55,036
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

885
01:14:57,046 --> 01:15:00,216
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

886
01:15:01,116 --> 01:15:03,316
Red leather spine.

887
01:15:03,526 --> 01:15:06,386
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

888
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:11,466
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

889
01:15:31,146 --> 01:15:33,376
Yeah. Paper patching.

890
01:15:33,486 --> 01:15:36,646
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

891
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:37,986
Paper-wrapped bullet.

892
01:15:38,096 --> 01:15:40,616
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

893
01:15:40,726 --> 01:15:43,756
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

894
01:15:43,866 --> 01:15:45,886
Leaves no traces when it hits.

895
01:15:45,996 --> 01:15:49,626
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

896
01:15:49,736 --> 01:15:51,036
I got another one.

897
01:15:51,776 --> 01:15:52,796
I thought you might.

898
01:15:52,906 --> 01:15:55,896
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

899
01:15:56,006 --> 01:15:57,706
Who's alive that could do that?

900
01:15:58,276 --> 01:16:02,406
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

901
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:05,646
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

902
01:16:05,756 --> 01:16:06,866
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

903
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:07,976
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

904
01:16:08,086 --> 01:16:09,556
Yeah, they said that, all right.

905
01:16:09,656 --> 01:16:13,356
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

906
01:16:14,356 --> 01:16:16,886
and WMDs were in Iraq,

907
01:16:16,996 --> 01:16:19,656
and Anna Nicole married for love!

908
01:16:21,636 --> 01:16:23,496
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

909
01:16:23,606 --> 01:16:24,666
How come?

910
01:16:24,776 --> 01:16:27,336
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

911
01:16:27,436 --> 01:16:29,336
That's how a conspiracy works.

912
01:16:29,446 --> 01:16:33,076
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

913
01:16:33,176 --> 01:16:37,116
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

914
01:16:37,216 --> 01:16:38,646
And you know this for a fact?

915
01:16:38,756 --> 01:16:40,546
Still got the shovel.

916
01:16:42,726 --> 01:16:44,556
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

917
01:16:44,656 --> 01:16:46,186
There was a guy in Russia.

918
01:16:46,296 --> 01:16:48,056
They locked his ass up.

919
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:51,426
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

920
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:54,196
There was one guy,

921
01:16:54,296 --> 01:16:56,566
but he don't shoot no more.

922
01:16:56,936 --> 01:16:59,696
A brutal son of a bitch.

923
01:16:59,806 --> 01:17:02,936
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

924
01:17:03,676 --> 01:17:05,376
wait till his friends come to help,

925
01:17:05,776 --> 01:17:06,936
kill them too.

926
01:17:07,046 --> 01:17:09,206
Turned one target into four.

927
01:17:09,986 --> 01:17:13,716
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

928
01:17:13,816 --> 01:17:16,086
The other side wanted him. Bad.

929
01:17:16,186 --> 01:17:21,496
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-story building.

930
01:17:22,696 --> 01:17:24,626
They quit the subtle tactics.

931
01:17:24,726 --> 01:17:27,356
They called in an artillery strike.

932
01:17:27,466 --> 01:17:29,366
Leveled a square block.

933
01:17:29,466 --> 01:17:31,626
Brought the building down on his ass.

934
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:34,176
Some say he crawled out of there.

935
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:36,006
Some say he died.

936
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:38,046
Never heard from him no more.

937
01:17:38,746 --> 01:17:40,306
Fuck me.

938
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,406
What?

939
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:42,946
I met the son of a bitch.

940
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:50,446
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

941
01:17:51,426 --> 01:17:52,546
No, sir.

942
01:17:52,656 --> 01:17:54,246
You keep that in mind.

943
01:17:54,356 --> 01:17:56,126
The moment you think you got it figured,

944
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:57,266
you're wrong.

945
01:18:01,336 --> 01:18:02,396
He got a name?

946
01:18:07,906 --> 01:18:09,336
Hey, it's me, Nick.

947
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:12,376
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

948
01:18:13,116 --> 01:18:15,106
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

949
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:16,446
It's better I don't tell you.

950
01:18:17,286 --> 01:18:19,646
Look, do you have a pen?

951
01:18:19,756 --> 01:18:22,216
I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

952
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:23,286
- Yeah.
- You got it?

953
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:24,376
I got it.

954
01:18:24,526 --> 01:18:26,356
Man, this is hard to spell.

955
01:18:32,566 --> 01:18:35,726
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

956
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,096
He'll try to track the shooter.

957
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:39,726
He won't get far that way.

958
01:18:39,836 --> 01:18:41,326
Yes, he will.

959
01:18:41,436 --> 01:18:43,536
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

960
01:18:43,646 --> 01:18:46,706
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

961
01:18:53,856 --> 01:18:55,546
And what happens to the bait?

962
01:18:57,086 --> 01:18:58,456
Hard to say.

963
01:18:59,456 --> 01:19:02,116
But that's the nature of being the bait.

964
01:19:15,176 --> 01:19:17,536
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?
- He's in Virginia.

965
01:19:18,616 --> 01:19:20,706
An end we thought was tied up

966
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:22,006
came untied.

967
01:19:22,946 --> 01:19:24,606
Meaning, Colonel?

968
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:26,546
Swagger is still alive.

969
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:31,356
Oh, my.

970
01:19:31,996 --> 01:19:36,626
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

971
01:19:38,296 --> 01:19:41,896
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

972
01:19:43,706 --> 01:19:45,466
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

973
01:19:45,576 --> 01:19:48,566
Twenty-four good, hard men.

974
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:50,836
Weapons and gear.

975
01:19:50,946 --> 01:19:52,466
Only 24?

976
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:55,316
Do kill him.

977
01:19:57,046 --> 01:19:58,986
No loose ends this time.

978
01:19:59,886 --> 01:20:01,286
Night, Colonel.

979
01:20:02,956 --> 01:20:03,946
Good night, Senator.

980
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:23,866
Hello?

981
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:27,476
Someone there?

982
01:21:03,746 --> 01:21:04,876
Now look.

983
01:21:05,586 --> 01:21:07,386
Look what you've done now.

984
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,086
Give me that.

985
01:21:12,196 --> 01:21:15,186
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

986
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:25,536
Where's your boyfriend?

987
01:21:27,776 --> 01:21:29,366
What if it's a trap?

988
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:31,176
Oh, it's a trap.

989
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:33,606
Guaranteed. Every time.

990
01:21:35,486 --> 01:21:37,176
Question is, for whom?

991
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:40,516
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

992
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:42,846
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

993
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:11,886
Let's go.

994
01:22:17,426 --> 01:22:19,446
Okay, so what are these for again?

995
01:22:20,156 --> 01:22:21,856
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

996
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:23,516
Right.

997
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:27,866
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

998
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:31,996
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

999
01:22:32,106 --> 01:22:34,266
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

1000
01:22:34,376 --> 01:22:35,806
For as much as we can be.

1001
01:22:48,956 --> 01:22:51,186
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

1002
01:22:51,286 --> 01:22:53,016
Take them one by one.

1003
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:55,056
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

1004
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:04,726
Fuck!

1005
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:09,476
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

1006
01:23:09,576 --> 01:23:12,096
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

1007
01:23:28,196 --> 01:23:29,716
No. No.

1008
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:32,096
It's just you and me, baby.

1009
01:23:32,196 --> 01:23:33,256
No!

1010
01:23:36,336 --> 01:23:37,806
You got three guards.

1011
01:23:38,706 --> 01:23:40,136
One at your 2:00,

1012
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:42,636
12:00

1013
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:45,136
and 10:00.

1014
01:23:53,756 --> 01:23:54,776
Danger close. 2:00,

1015
01:23:54,886 --> 01:23:55,856
fifty yards.

1016
01:24:59,486 --> 01:25:00,546
You got one right on you.

1017
01:25:00,986 --> 01:25:01,956
20 yards and closing.

1018
01:25:52,676 --> 01:25:54,066
Go check the perimeter.

1019
01:25:54,506 --> 01:25:56,026
And tell the others to stay alert.

1020
01:25:56,146 --> 01:25:57,866
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1021
01:26:32,046 --> 01:26:33,536
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1022
01:26:52,266 --> 01:26:53,566
You killed all three?

1023
01:26:54,496 --> 01:26:55,836
There were four.

1024
01:26:56,766 --> 01:27:00,226
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1025
01:27:00,336 --> 01:27:02,206
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

1026
01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:03,736
to kill the Archbishop.

1027
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:06,166
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1028
01:27:06,276 --> 01:27:08,336
And if I don't know any of those things?

1029
01:27:08,446 --> 01:27:09,536
Then you're of no worth to me

1030
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,806
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1031
01:27:16,026 --> 01:27:18,426
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1032
01:27:18,526 --> 01:27:22,286
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1033
01:27:22,396 --> 01:27:24,126
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1034
01:27:25,796 --> 01:27:27,326
He's ex-army.

1035
01:27:27,436 --> 01:27:29,866
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1036
01:27:33,176 --> 01:27:34,266
Go on.

1037
01:27:36,106 --> 01:27:38,876
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1038
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,446
Recruitment for a single job.

1039
01:27:44,146 --> 01:27:45,586
They like the wounded.

1040
01:27:46,686 --> 01:27:48,346
Easier to use

1041
01:27:49,386 --> 01:27:51,356
and then throw away
when you are done.

1042
01:27:52,756 --> 01:27:54,746
Timmons, you, me...

1043
01:27:57,396 --> 01:28:02,336
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1044
01:28:03,436 --> 01:28:08,206
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1045
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:10,606
And the Archbishop?

1046
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:16,076
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1047
01:28:16,346 --> 01:28:18,746
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1048
01:28:20,186 --> 01:28:21,616
What was he going to say?

1049
01:28:22,656 --> 01:28:23,986
The truth.

1050
01:28:24,086 --> 01:28:27,646
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1051
01:28:27,756 --> 01:28:31,256
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1052
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:33,356
Over there, and here.

1053
01:28:35,466 --> 01:28:37,266
The problem isn't the doing.

1054
01:28:38,776 --> 01:28:40,866
It's the people in power having to admit

1055
01:28:41,336 --> 01:28:42,436
that they knew.

1056
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:47,006
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1057
01:28:47,116 --> 01:28:49,276
and only the underlings go to jail.

1058
01:28:50,016 --> 01:28:51,606
Their bosses knew.

1059
01:28:51,716 --> 01:28:53,846
We know their bosses knew.

1060
01:28:53,956 --> 01:28:55,176
But you don't say it.

1061
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:57,016
What exactly happened in Africa?

1062
01:28:57,126 --> 01:28:59,616
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1063
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:01,756
that an oil pipeline

1064
01:29:02,366 --> 01:29:05,126
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1065
01:29:05,226 --> 01:29:08,666
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1066
01:29:08,766 --> 01:29:09,736
Drink?

1067
01:29:09,836 --> 01:29:10,896
So they asked them all nicely to move

1068
01:29:11,006 --> 01:29:12,366
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1069
01:29:12,476 --> 01:29:13,436
No.

1070
01:29:13,676 --> 01:29:14,896
They didn't ask.

1071
01:29:15,276 --> 01:29:16,636
They just killed them.

1072
01:29:16,746 --> 01:29:17,706
All.

1073
01:29:17,976 --> 01:29:20,946
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1074
01:29:21,046 --> 01:29:22,376
They'll just go.

1075
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:38,426
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1076
01:29:38,526 --> 01:29:42,226
men, women, children,

1077
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:46,966
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

1078
01:29:48,736 --> 01:29:50,176
You should know.

1079
01:29:50,276 --> 01:29:54,306
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1080
01:29:55,686 --> 01:29:58,446
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

1081
01:30:07,596 --> 01:30:08,756
Who runs Johnson?

1082
01:30:08,866 --> 01:30:10,056
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1083
01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:11,256
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1084
01:30:12,836 --> 01:30:14,456
You don't get it.

1085
01:30:14,896 --> 01:30:16,996
There is no head to cut off.

1086
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:19,966
It's a conglomerate.

1087
01:30:20,606 --> 01:30:23,366
If one of them betrays the principles

1088
01:30:24,876 --> 01:30:27,106
of the accrual of money and power,

1089
01:30:28,216 --> 01:30:29,906
the others betray him.

1090
01:30:31,016 --> 01:30:32,536
What it is

1091
01:30:34,816 --> 01:30:37,116
is human weakness.

1092
01:30:38,486 --> 01:30:41,396
You can't kill that with a gun.

1093
01:30:49,306 --> 01:30:50,266
Swagger.

1094
01:30:50,366 --> 01:30:51,356
Swagger.

1095
01:30:51,466 --> 01:30:54,266
You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.

1096
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:58,166
Had to keep you till they got here.

1097
01:30:59,646 --> 01:31:02,946
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1098
01:31:03,716 --> 01:31:05,276
You would have known.

1099
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:13,556
By the way, they've got your woman.

1100
01:31:16,626 --> 01:31:17,686
Swagger.

1101
01:31:17,796 --> 01:31:21,256
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1102
01:31:23,036 --> 01:31:24,936
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
- Roger that.

1103
01:31:57,006 --> 01:31:58,666
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1104
01:31:59,576 --> 01:32:00,696
You got to get out of there.

1105
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:02,276
- They're all over the place.
- Hey!

1106
01:32:02,876 --> 01:32:04,276
Calm down.

1107
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:06,866
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1108
01:32:07,176 --> 01:32:08,976
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1109
01:32:16,556 --> 01:32:17,526
Listen very carefully.

1110
01:32:17,686 --> 01:32:19,316
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1111
01:32:19,426 --> 01:32:20,396
then the gas.

1112
01:32:21,426 --> 01:32:23,186
Three, two, one...

1113
01:32:53,096 --> 01:32:54,216
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1114
01:33:49,346 --> 01:33:50,336
Swagger!

1115
01:33:57,586 --> 01:33:58,886
You got it.

1116
01:34:10,236 --> 01:34:11,396
Swagger!

1117
01:34:13,806 --> 01:34:15,366
Swagger!

1118
01:34:16,076 --> 01:34:17,406
Swagger!

1119
01:34:24,016 --> 01:34:25,876
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1120
01:34:25,986 --> 01:34:26,956
Okay.

1121
01:34:27,056 --> 01:34:28,106
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1122
01:34:28,216 --> 01:34:29,246
Go!

1123
01:34:32,726 --> 01:34:33,696
Come on!

1124
01:35:02,116 --> 01:35:03,386
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1125
01:35:03,686 --> 01:35:04,656
What?

1126
01:35:04,826 --> 01:35:06,686
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1127
01:35:06,796 --> 01:35:08,126
Okay. Okay.

1128
01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:10,096
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

1129
01:35:11,866 --> 01:35:12,856
All right, go!

1130
01:35:26,276 --> 01:35:27,766
Pull up! Pull up!

1131
01:35:43,826 --> 01:35:44,816
Time to go!

1132
01:36:02,716 --> 01:36:03,646
Let me take a look.

1133
01:36:04,086 --> 01:36:05,046
Not right now.

1134
01:36:05,646 --> 01:36:06,946
Morning, beautiful.

1135
01:36:07,056 --> 01:36:09,286
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

1136
01:36:09,386 --> 01:36:13,726
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1137
01:36:13,826 --> 01:36:17,456
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

1138
01:36:17,566 --> 01:36:20,796
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1139
01:36:22,606 --> 01:36:26,036
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1140
01:36:26,506 --> 01:36:27,906
of the FBl.

1141
01:36:28,206 --> 01:36:29,726
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1142
01:36:33,076 --> 01:36:36,536
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1143
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,146
what the fuck is going on?

1144
01:36:46,156 --> 01:36:47,486
Great shot!

1145
01:36:51,026 --> 01:36:53,556
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

1146
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:56,926
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1147
01:36:58,536 --> 01:37:00,006
Think what you want.

1148
01:37:02,536 --> 01:37:06,496
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1149
01:37:08,316 --> 01:37:10,306
There's always a confused soul

1150
01:37:10,416 --> 01:37:13,006
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1151
01:37:14,186 --> 01:37:17,316
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1152
01:37:19,656 --> 01:37:21,626
That's the hassle with democracy.

1153
01:37:22,126 --> 01:37:23,156
Pull!

1154
01:37:37,506 --> 01:37:39,446
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1155
01:37:39,546 --> 01:37:41,106
We need those results now.

1156
01:37:41,216 --> 01:37:43,546
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna!... to the roadhouse.

1157
01:37:43,646 --> 01:37:46,246
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1158
01:37:46,356 --> 01:37:49,516
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1159
01:37:49,626 --> 01:37:50,846
Start a trace.

1160
01:37:51,756 --> 01:37:53,346
Got it. I'm on it.

1161
01:37:53,456 --> 01:37:55,686
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1162
01:37:55,956 --> 01:37:59,086
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1163
01:38:00,196 --> 01:38:02,136
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1164
01:38:02,236 --> 01:38:04,826
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1165
01:38:05,566 --> 01:38:06,796
Got him.

1166
01:38:06,906 --> 01:38:08,536
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1167
01:38:08,636 --> 01:38:11,436
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1168
01:38:11,546 --> 01:38:15,916
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1169
01:38:16,016 --> 01:38:17,916
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1170
01:38:18,016 --> 01:38:19,006
Why?

1171
01:38:19,116 --> 01:38:21,106
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1172
01:38:22,016 --> 01:38:24,386
- But we're the FBl, son.
- Yeah, I know.

1173
01:38:24,786 --> 01:38:25,916
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1174
01:38:26,226 --> 01:38:27,316
Oh, Nick, wait...

1175
01:38:27,426 --> 01:38:29,326
Son of a bitch.

1176
01:38:29,426 --> 01:38:30,456
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

1177
01:38:30,566 --> 01:38:31,656
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

1178
01:38:31,766 --> 01:38:33,996
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

1179
01:38:39,776 --> 01:38:40,736
This is Swagger.

1180
01:38:40,836 --> 01:38:42,536
- Colonel Johnson here.
- Figured you'd be listening.

1181
01:38:42,636 --> 01:38:45,036
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
- Colonel?

1182
01:38:45,576 --> 01:38:46,546
If it is 'Colonel'?

1183
01:38:46,976 --> 01:38:48,106
It is.

1184
01:38:49,616 --> 01:38:52,636
- I have something you want.
- Well, it seems so do I.

1185
01:38:55,716 --> 01:39:00,486
Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

1186
01:39:00,596 --> 01:39:03,286
Men, women, children.

1187
01:39:04,466 --> 01:39:06,396
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1188
01:39:06,496 --> 01:39:07,966
I just want someone there I can trust.

1189
01:39:08,066 --> 01:39:10,656
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1190
01:39:10,766 --> 01:39:12,666
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1191
01:39:12,776 --> 01:39:15,176
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

1192
01:39:15,276 --> 01:39:17,266
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1193
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:20,706
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1194
01:39:20,816 --> 01:39:24,306
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1195
01:39:25,286 --> 01:39:27,076
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

1196
01:39:27,386 --> 01:39:28,616
from Montana?

1197
01:39:28,716 --> 01:39:31,556
Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?

1198
01:39:33,326 --> 01:39:34,586
I don't think so.

1199
01:39:34,696 --> 01:39:37,556
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1200
01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:40,286
Point 732. Point 648.

1201
01:39:40,836 --> 01:39:42,026
And what the hell is that?

1202
01:39:42,136 --> 01:39:45,296
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few meters of latitude and longitude,

1203
01:39:45,406 --> 01:39:47,396
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1204
01:39:47,506 --> 01:39:48,836
with 400 bodies underneath.

1205
01:39:49,546 --> 01:39:50,736
Where are we meeting?

1206
01:39:52,406 --> 01:39:54,506
Somewhere I can see you,

1207
01:39:55,576 --> 01:39:58,346
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1208
01:41:06,856 --> 01:41:08,186
Where's your boy?

1209
01:41:22,566 --> 01:41:24,196
Well, I'm here.

1210
01:41:33,016 --> 01:41:34,036
He's here.

1211
01:41:34,146 --> 01:41:35,446
Look, look, look.

1212
01:41:36,286 --> 01:41:38,306
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1213
01:41:46,996 --> 01:41:49,086
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1214
01:41:59,366 --> 01:42:00,666
Okay.

1215
01:42:44,216 --> 01:42:45,846
I think I broke a rib!

1216
01:42:47,486 --> 01:42:48,676
Don't move!

1217
01:42:49,116 --> 01:42:50,556
Is there anybody else?

1218
01:42:51,156 --> 01:42:52,126
No.

1219
01:43:19,046 --> 01:43:21,676
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1220
01:43:22,986 --> 01:43:24,976
You got no shot!

1221
01:43:25,086 --> 01:43:28,486
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1222
01:43:31,266 --> 01:43:32,956
You got no shot!

1223
01:43:33,596 --> 01:43:36,396
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1224
01:43:45,376 --> 01:43:47,036
It's over for you, buddy!

1225
01:43:52,086 --> 01:43:54,716
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1226
01:44:08,736 --> 01:44:10,256
Not bad!

1227
01:44:10,366 --> 01:44:12,566
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1228
01:44:15,006 --> 01:44:16,136
Christ.

1229
01:44:33,996 --> 01:44:35,086
How can we help you?

1230
01:44:35,196 --> 01:44:37,356
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1231
01:44:37,466 --> 01:44:39,256
to bring this by here at 3:00 p. m.

1232
01:44:43,136 --> 01:44:44,126
Let's move!

1233
01:45:13,026 --> 01:45:14,016
You all right?

1234
01:45:14,836 --> 01:45:15,796
Yeah.

1235
01:45:26,176 --> 01:45:27,146
Search him.

1236
01:45:27,246 --> 01:45:28,806
I don't carry a weapon,

1237
01:45:31,816 --> 01:45:33,046
ordinarily.

1238
01:45:33,616 --> 01:45:35,746
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1239
01:45:43,766 --> 01:45:45,056
Pull the pilot.

1240
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:48,756
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1241
01:45:48,866 --> 01:45:50,026
Put your gun down!

1242
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:51,256
Easy. Easy.

1243
01:46:01,716 --> 01:46:02,766
Sarah.

1244
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:05,446
Give me the gun.

1245
01:46:06,146 --> 01:46:07,916
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1246
01:46:17,266 --> 01:46:18,456
You okay?

1247
01:46:18,626 --> 01:46:21,226
Put them up. Keep them up.

1248
01:46:21,336 --> 01:46:22,886
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1249
01:46:23,966 --> 01:46:26,566
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1250
01:46:26,676 --> 01:46:28,936
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1251
01:46:29,036 --> 01:46:30,006
You do, huh?

1252
01:46:30,146 --> 01:46:33,136
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1253
01:46:33,816 --> 01:46:36,806
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1254
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:38,676
just as a preamble?

1255
01:46:38,786 --> 01:46:40,646
You got any plans after this?

1256
01:46:41,316 --> 01:46:45,756
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1257
01:46:45,856 --> 01:46:48,056
Work? For you?

1258
01:46:48,156 --> 01:46:51,926
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1259
01:46:52,026 --> 01:46:55,586
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1260
01:46:55,696 --> 01:46:57,756
And what side are you on?

1261
01:46:57,866 --> 01:47:00,736
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1262
01:47:00,836 --> 01:47:01,996
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1263
01:47:02,106 --> 01:47:04,406
There's only haves and have-nots.

1264
01:47:04,506 --> 01:47:07,496
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1265
01:47:07,916 --> 01:47:11,106
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1266
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,046
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1267
01:47:13,146 --> 01:47:14,136
so a pipeline could go through.

1268
01:47:14,256 --> 01:47:15,846
One village!

1269
01:47:15,956 --> 01:47:17,976
And it brought stability to the region.

1270
01:47:18,086 --> 01:47:21,256
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1271
01:47:21,356 --> 01:47:23,156
because their
grandmother's grandfather

1272
01:47:23,266 --> 01:47:24,856
belonged to a different tribe.

1273
01:47:25,866 --> 01:47:27,356
They like us down there, boy.

1274
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,496
This is a country

1275
01:47:37,246 --> 01:47:39,436
where the Secretary of Defense

1276
01:47:41,616 --> 01:47:43,206
can go on TV

1277
01:47:43,586 --> 01:47:45,706
and tell the American public,

1278
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:49,546
oh, that 'This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!'

1279
01:47:50,356 --> 01:47:52,286
And nobody questions him,

1280
01:47:52,386 --> 01:47:53,826
because they don't want to hear
the answer

1281
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:55,256
because it's a lie!

1282
01:47:57,696 --> 01:48:01,926
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1283
01:48:02,336 --> 01:48:03,996
Now are you on the inside,

1284
01:48:04,336 --> 01:48:05,636
or are you on the out?

1285
01:48:12,706 --> 01:48:14,046
It's the FBl!

1286
01:48:14,876 --> 01:48:16,476
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1287
01:48:19,216 --> 01:48:22,586
If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...

1288
01:48:22,686 --> 01:48:24,346
I don't think so, Senator.

1289
01:48:28,596 --> 01:48:30,526
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

1290
01:48:30,966 --> 01:48:33,086
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

1291
01:48:33,196 --> 01:48:37,036
This stuffs plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1292
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:40,596
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1293
01:48:40,706 --> 01:48:43,696
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1294
01:48:43,806 --> 01:48:45,336
I'm out, old man!

1295
01:48:45,446 --> 01:48:48,246
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1296
01:48:48,346 --> 01:48:49,646
You happy?

1297
01:48:53,956 --> 01:48:55,716
Where do you think you're going?

1298
01:48:55,816 --> 01:48:57,256
Washington!

1299
01:48:57,356 --> 01:49:01,796
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. senator in the back?

1300
01:49:01,896 --> 01:49:03,446
Lord knows I want to.

1301
01:49:04,326 --> 01:49:05,766
I didn't think so.

1302
01:49:07,036 --> 01:49:08,226
Let him go.

1303
01:49:09,266 --> 01:49:10,896
They've got your rifle.

1304
01:49:12,506 --> 01:49:14,936
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1305
01:49:15,036 --> 01:49:16,696
Recovered at the site.

1306
01:49:24,046 --> 01:49:26,706
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1307
01:49:27,186 --> 01:49:29,676
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1308
01:49:29,786 --> 01:49:32,276
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1309
01:49:37,496 --> 01:49:38,626
I won.

1310
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:41,026
You lost.

1311
01:49:41,836 --> 01:49:43,996
Get used to the idea, son.

1312
01:49:44,466 --> 01:49:45,906
I'm not your son.

1313
01:50:00,556 --> 01:50:02,816
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

1314
01:50:02,916 --> 01:50:06,486
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBl!
Don't shoot!

1315
01:50:06,586 --> 01:50:08,756
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

1316
01:50:09,356 --> 01:50:10,386
I said get down!

1317
01:50:29,746 --> 01:50:32,376
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

1318
01:50:32,486 --> 01:50:34,106
Thank you, sir.

1319
01:50:35,586 --> 01:50:37,246
Thanks for bringing her.

1320
01:50:42,796 --> 01:50:45,426
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1321
01:50:45,526 --> 01:50:47,826
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1322
01:50:51,566 --> 01:50:54,196
This is Attorney General Russert.

1323
01:50:55,206 --> 01:50:57,796
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

1324
01:50:57,906 --> 01:51:00,236
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1325
01:51:00,346 --> 01:51:02,506
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1326
01:51:02,616 --> 01:51:04,846
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1327
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:09,146
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBl.

1328
01:51:09,256 --> 01:51:10,716
What the hell am I doing here?

1329
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:13,046
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1330
01:51:13,526 --> 01:51:14,926
Call the Joint Chief.

1331
01:51:16,556 --> 01:51:17,856
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1332
01:51:17,966 --> 01:51:20,326
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1333
01:51:20,436 --> 01:51:22,896
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1334
01:51:22,996 --> 01:51:24,486
telling me to let you go.

1335
01:51:24,606 --> 01:51:27,696
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1336
01:51:28,636 --> 01:51:30,106
and am, indeed, required by law,

1337
01:51:30,246 --> 01:51:32,436
to tell them to fuck off.

1338
01:51:32,546 --> 01:51:34,206
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1339
01:51:34,316 --> 01:51:36,246
so you sit there and be quiet.

1340
01:51:39,886 --> 01:51:41,876
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1341
01:51:41,986 --> 01:51:43,116
Thank you.

1342
01:51:45,326 --> 01:51:47,056
This is my weapon.

1343
01:51:47,156 --> 01:51:49,486
No question about it, don't deny it.

1344
01:51:49,596 --> 01:51:51,956
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1345
01:51:52,066 --> 01:51:53,026
We agree?

1346
01:51:53,766 --> 01:51:55,286
It's been in the FBl's possession
ever since,

1347
01:51:55,396 --> 01:51:56,796
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1348
01:51:56,906 --> 01:51:58,426
No. Absolutely not.

1349
01:51:58,536 --> 01:52:00,666
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

1350
01:52:00,776 --> 01:52:02,936
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1351
01:52:03,036 --> 01:52:05,946
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1352
01:52:06,046 --> 01:52:08,406
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1353
01:52:09,546 --> 01:52:11,206
Definitely my gun.

1354
01:52:11,316 --> 01:52:13,786
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1355
01:52:13,886 --> 01:52:15,406
Nope. No, I don't.

1356
01:52:15,516 --> 01:52:18,046
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

1357
01:52:18,156 --> 01:52:19,586
- Trust me?
- Yep.

1358
01:52:19,686 --> 01:52:20,846
Really trust me?

1359
01:52:21,226 --> 01:52:22,196
Yeah.

1360
01:52:23,256 --> 01:52:24,456
With your life?

1361
01:52:25,066 --> 01:52:26,466
- Yep.
- Good.

1362
01:52:28,036 --> 01:52:30,396
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

1363
01:52:30,506 --> 01:52:33,336
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1364
01:52:33,436 --> 01:52:34,926
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1365
01:52:35,036 --> 01:52:36,166
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

1366
01:52:36,276 --> 01:52:37,796
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1367
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:45,976
I could keep doing this all day,

1368
01:52:46,716 --> 01:52:48,306
with every weapon in my house.

1369
01:52:48,816 --> 01:52:51,876
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1370
01:52:51,986 --> 01:52:54,016
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1371
01:52:54,496 --> 01:52:55,856
But the gun don't shoot.

1372
01:52:56,256 --> 01:52:58,256
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1373
01:52:58,366 --> 01:53:00,126
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1374
01:53:00,236 --> 01:53:03,466
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1375
01:53:03,566 --> 01:53:05,866
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1376
01:53:05,966 --> 01:53:07,736
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1377
01:53:07,836 --> 01:53:10,396
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1378
01:53:11,706 --> 01:53:12,836
Whatever.

1379
01:53:13,616 --> 01:53:15,076
Who gives a shit?

1380
01:53:16,416 --> 01:53:17,876
Nice presentation.

1381
01:53:17,986 --> 01:53:19,776
But none of it sticks to me.

1382
01:53:20,986 --> 01:53:24,186
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1383
01:53:24,286 --> 01:53:25,546
Done.

1384
01:53:25,656 --> 01:53:26,986
I'll be seeing you.

1385
01:53:27,096 --> 01:53:30,286
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1386
01:53:30,396 --> 01:53:31,586
Yeah, in this country.

1387
01:53:31,696 --> 01:53:34,326
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1388
01:53:39,736 --> 01:53:45,196
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1389
01:53:45,306 --> 01:53:48,006
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1390
01:53:48,116 --> 01:53:49,076
My God.

1391
01:53:49,276 --> 01:53:50,476
Look around you.

1392
01:53:51,046 --> 01:53:53,176
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1393
01:53:53,286 --> 01:53:54,846
That's all hearsay.

1394
01:53:54,956 --> 01:53:57,576
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1395
01:53:57,686 --> 01:53:59,126
And I'm free to go.

1396
01:53:59,756 --> 01:54:01,556
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1397
01:54:01,656 --> 01:54:05,596
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1398
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,826
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1399
01:54:08,866 --> 01:54:10,356
these events occurred
in another country,

1400
01:54:10,466 --> 01:54:11,766
outside of our laws.

1401
01:54:11,866 --> 01:54:14,396
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1402
01:54:14,506 --> 01:54:16,526
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1403
01:54:17,406 --> 01:54:19,706
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1404
01:54:19,806 --> 01:54:22,476
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1405
01:54:22,576 --> 01:54:26,106
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1406
01:54:29,586 --> 01:54:31,216
I win.

1407
01:54:31,326 --> 01:54:32,546
You lose.

1408
01:54:33,286 --> 01:54:34,256
Again.

1409
01:54:36,626 --> 01:54:38,186
This is ridiculous.

1410
01:55:00,486 --> 01:55:04,046
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1411
01:55:04,756 --> 01:55:06,656
But this is the world we live in.

1412
01:55:06,756 --> 01:55:09,696
And justice does not always prevail.

1413
01:55:09,796 --> 01:55:10,756
It's not the Wild West,

1414
01:55:10,866 --> 01:55:13,156
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1415
01:55:14,496 --> 01:55:17,336
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1416
01:55:21,976 --> 01:55:24,506
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1417
01:55:28,646 --> 01:55:30,446
Unshackle the sergeant.

1418
01:55:33,786 --> 01:55:36,016
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1419
01:55:36,116 --> 01:55:37,386
In the face.

1420
01:55:38,786 --> 01:55:41,016
You heard that expression,

1421
01:55:41,126 --> 01:55:43,426
'You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind'?

1422
01:55:47,396 --> 01:55:50,626
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1423
01:55:51,736 --> 01:55:56,036
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1424
01:55:56,136 --> 01:55:59,546
'This is about evidence and the truth!'

1425
01:55:59,646 --> 01:56:02,166
And then you just said to him,

1426
01:56:02,276 --> 01:56:03,576
'Fuck you!'

1427
01:56:04,646 --> 01:56:07,046
'Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G.'

1428
01:56:09,316 --> 01:56:10,616
'Fuck you!

1429
01:56:12,386 --> 01:56:14,826
'The truth is what I say it is!'

1430
01:56:21,896 --> 01:56:24,236
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1431
01:56:24,336 --> 01:56:26,096
You're going to Ecuador.

1432
01:56:29,576 --> 01:56:33,166
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1433
01:56:33,276 --> 01:56:36,836
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralize the problem, but...

1434
01:56:37,116 --> 01:56:38,806
Well, they've requested you.

1435
01:56:40,586 --> 01:56:41,946
It's solvable.

1436
01:56:44,626 --> 01:56:45,816
They requested you...

1437
01:56:48,156 --> 01:56:49,186
Swagger.

1438
01:56:54,066 --> 01:56:55,126
Turn off the lights!

1439
01:57:02,706 --> 01:57:03,726
Get my car.

1440
01:57:03,906 --> 01:57:05,036
Get my car.

1441
01:57:24,896 --> 01:57:25,866
Do something.

1442
01:57:26,666 --> 01:57:27,896
Do something!

1443
01:57:36,206 --> 01:57:37,336
Where is he?

1444
01:57:50,016 --> 01:57:51,146
He's under the floor!

1445
01:58:21,956 --> 01:58:23,546
You don't need to kill me.

1446
01:58:24,886 --> 01:58:26,516
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1447
01:58:26,956 --> 01:58:27,926
It was them.

1448
01:58:30,726 --> 01:58:33,496
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1449
01:58:35,696 --> 01:58:38,096
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1450
01:58:40,436 --> 01:58:43,836
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

1451
01:58:43,946 --> 01:58:46,776
I am a United States senator!

1452
01:58:46,976 --> 01:58:47,946
Exactly.
