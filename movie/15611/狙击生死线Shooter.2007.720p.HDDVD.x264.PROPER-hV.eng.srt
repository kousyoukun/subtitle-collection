1
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,286
Movement.

2
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:06,655
Two men.

3
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:09,699
Approximately

4
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,932
40 goats.

5
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,769
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:19,869
Egress?

7
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:25,445
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:29,945
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,799
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:45,360
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,831
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,271
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,774
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,773
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:12,455
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:13,723
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:15,025
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:18,460
Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.

19
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,198
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

20
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:25,798
Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.

21
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,810
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

22
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,244
I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.

23
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,784
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

24
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,715
Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

25
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,187
possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.

26
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,483
Call them out.

27
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:41,925
Target.

28
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,421
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,792
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:47,864
Range it.

31
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,165
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,574
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,773
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,508
On target.

35
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:05,946
Hold scope.

36
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,381
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,012
Hit.

38
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,854
Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.

39
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:24,365
Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.

40
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:37,078
Call it in. It's time to go.

41
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,081
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

42
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:40,207
- Packing up.
- Shit!

43
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,684
Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.

44
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,119
Weren't supposed to be
hostiles that close!

45
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,530
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

46
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,567
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

47
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,008
Fire when ready.

48
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,113
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.

49
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,312
- I see it, Donnie. I see it.
- Fire when ready.

50
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:30,498
- They don't know where we are.
- But they might get lucky!

51
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,962
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

52
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:37,336
Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.

53
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:40,171
Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.

54
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:44,179
We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.

55
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,350
Command Post, do you read me?

56
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:49,680
Shut it down.

57
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:50,921
They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,785
eight kilometers inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,223
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

60
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,794
Radio check. Do you read me?

61
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,954
- Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
- Do you read me?

62
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:02,726
- Pull out those tracks.
- Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

63
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,704
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

64
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:17,940
Call it in!

65
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:24,086
Shit! The channel's down!

66
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:25,212
That's impossible!

67
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:26,721
The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:29,657
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,495
Donnie?

70
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,333
Donnie!

71
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,395
Come on, boy!

72
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:49,427
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:53,362
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,494
Come on.

75
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:55,697
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:56,873
What?

77
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,068
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:03,812
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:18,484
Good boy.

80
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:27,101
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,065
Here, boy.

82
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,706
Good boy.

83
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:48,751
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:51,350
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:53,825
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:56,525
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,932
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:03,473
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:06,407
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,772
No official report.

91
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:12,110
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,309
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:17,581
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,588
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,453
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:24,652
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,096
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:39,402
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,640
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:47,444
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

101
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:50,952
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,384
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:04,762
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:21,540
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:25,349
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:28,623
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,750
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:32,423
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,791
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:35,421
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:37,734
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,392
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:40,595
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,571
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

115
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:48,074
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,669
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,214
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,139
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

119
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,583
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:57,813
He understands.

121
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,847
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,084
Slowly.

123
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:05,328
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,293
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,796
You know what that is?

126
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,839
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

127
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:18,931
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:20,076
Yours?

129
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:21,776
Yeah.

130
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,869
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,505
What did you do?

132
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:29,347
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,216
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,419
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,254
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:43,895
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,025
Whose president?

138
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,159
Ours.

139
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,169
I didn't say 'execute'.

140
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,907
Plan.

141
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,767
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:57,506
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:00,947
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,616
It was internal.

145
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:07,087
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,023
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:15,588
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:20,193
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:23,136
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,068
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:30,840
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:33,939
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:35,807
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:41,315
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:44,821
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:48,258
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:50,265
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,200
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,897
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,004
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,633
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:03,838
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:05,278
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

164
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:07,475
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:10,678
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:13,017
President'll be wearing body amour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:14,283
at over a mile.

168
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,655
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,988
Yes.

170
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,461
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:22,933
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,794
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,869
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,870
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,837
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,675
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:35,210
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:37,075
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:41,182
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:41,685 --> 00:14:42,947
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:47,722
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:49,485
against all enemies,

183
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,220
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,262
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:04,263
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,470
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,977
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:14,744
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:17,610
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,205
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,572
The truck.

192
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,546
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:48,209
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

194
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,015
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:53,680
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,016
This is beautiful.

197
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:04,261
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,067
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:14,473
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:16,102
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,545
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:20,138
This is our guy.

203
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,649
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:24,185
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,122
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:45,593
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:19,026
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,512
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:40,645
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.

210
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:42,019
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,260
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,189
Okay.

213
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:51,355
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:53,169
Yeah.

215
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,483
This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.

216
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,423
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,325
Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.

218
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,077
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,082
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:50,316
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,547
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:54,953
...both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

223
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:57,219
were debated and signed here.

224
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:06,791
Out of the three cities,

225
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:09,838
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

226
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,735
There was no room in Baltimore.

227
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,274
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

228
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:15,139
buildings are in the way.

229
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:16,769
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

230
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,942
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

231
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,005
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

232
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:20,139
waiting for him in the afterlife,

233
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,774
I'd rule that out.

234
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:23,011
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

235
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,720
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

236
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,289
It's one of six possible locations,

237
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,325
approximately five stories
above the President's location.

238
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,555
Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.

239
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:34,891
They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,

240
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,522
several lines into his speech.

241
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:39,431
That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.

242
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,470
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

243
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:44,335
Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

244
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,737
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

245
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:46,866
touch more slippery.

246
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:48,466
Least that's what I'd do.

247
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,910
You can kill him from that far away?

248
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,884
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

249
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,178
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

250
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:57,981
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

251
00:21:58,588 --> 00:21:59,850
The challenge is the wind.

252
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:01,821
Lightest breeze uncorrected
at that distance

253
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,222
is enough to ruin the shot.

254
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:06,523
He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.

255
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,119
Velocity corrections are easy,

256
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,028
but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.

257
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,101
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

258
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:15,171
Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.

259
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:18,331
Impressive recon and report, son.

260
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:20,466
Move too soon, we lose him.

261
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:21,874
We want to take him alive.

262
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:25,504
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

263
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,082
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

264
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,780
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

265
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,016
A moment?

266
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:39,661
You've done your country
a great service, son.

267
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:40,751
- On the day...
- Look...

268
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:41,921
Listen.

269
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,332
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

270
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,168
I could use a spotter.

271
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,973
Thank you, Philadelphia.

272
00:23:58,074 --> 00:24:00,167
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

273
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:01,903
...before you on this stage...

274
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:04,673
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

275
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:07,875
...patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,

276
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,747
the Declaration of Independence...

277
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:10,978
Sir?

278
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,714
...and a country,
the United States of America,

279
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,255
that changed the world.

280
00:24:14,357 --> 00:24:16,689
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

281
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:18,590
Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.

282
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,459
Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

283
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:25,056
All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.

284
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,562
- Stand by.
- Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

285
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:36,935
Copy that.

286
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,412
Post 18 clear, over.

287
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:42,143
Post 19, please report.
What's your status?

288
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,580
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

289
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,123
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

290
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,715
The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

291
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:53,489
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

292
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:56,156
There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop

293
00:24:56,265 --> 00:24:59,428
as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.

294
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:01,901
He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony

295
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,335
to discuss these matters.

296
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,737
These are great times.

297
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:08,973
These are historic times.

298
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:12,377
And these are troubled times, as well.

299
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:16,516
This medal that your country...

300
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:17,847
Yellow ribbons.

301
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:20,514
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

302
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:22,853
No, they tie those low around trees.

303
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:25,126
These are windage flags.

304
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:26,794
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

305
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,386
for a shot from the steeple.

306
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:30,761
Yeah. Maybe.

307
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,926
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

308
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,969
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

309
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,904
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

310
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:41,670
...raises its head
and confronts freedom,

311
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:47,114
but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.

312
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:50,913
And it is our responsibility

313
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,250
to find these dark weeds.

314
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:58,019
Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

315
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,092
- If you just joined us...
- Hi.

316
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:04,826
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

317
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:07,432
Bob Lee Swagger.

318
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:12,300
It is a real honor to meet you.

319
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:14,103
You're unsnapped, officer.

320
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:17,569
Shit. Oh, fuck.

321
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,944
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

322
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,540
Again, it's an honor.

323
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:30,518
...of our stewardship of this great...

324
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:34,153
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

325
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:36,527
He's getting a medal. Know it?

326
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:38,725
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

327
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:40,803
You know I worked there?

328
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,700
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

329
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,739
when you shoot a civilian, right?

330
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:47,139
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

331
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:48,710
That's very original.

332
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:52,080
Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.

333
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,672
The President speaks next.

334
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,046
All teams stand by.

335
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,479
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.

336
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:03,251
Agent James, all clear.

337
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,384
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

338
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:07,429
- Got wind at three, full value.
- ... to introduce to you

339
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:09,497
the President of the United States.

340
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,692
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

341
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:14,661
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

342
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:39,922
He's loaded.

343
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,965
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

344
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:47,668
In the city that was the capital of...

345
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,237
We got to take him.

346
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:50,805
Ten seconds.

347
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:53,569
Wind matches his setup.
Take him! Take him now!

348
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,075
Send in the ERT team. Take out the...

349
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,170
Shots fired! Shots fired!

350
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,760
Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.

351
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,959
- What? Flashlight down?
- I say again. Flashlight is down.

352
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:22,094
- The President has been shot.
- There's mass confusion...

353
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,339
Has the President been shot?

354
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,203
Right at the church steeple.

355
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:33,007
How could you miss?

356
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,578
How could you fucking miss?

357
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:38,848
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

358
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:40,547
He's bleeding. Kill him.

359
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:44,588
Command Post to Condor Two,
load up, over.

360
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,161
Condor Two loading up.

361
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:50,823
Go, go, go, go, go!

362
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:59,106
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

363
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,921
Condor Two, this is Command Post.
Stand by for update, over.

364
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,388
Standing by, over.

365
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,456
Command Post!

366
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:21,891
Command Post!
Command Post, this is Post 19.

367
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:23,022
You guys read me?

368
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,190
- Should I hold post?
- Please.

369
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,564
Please help me. Please. They shot me.

370
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,933
- FBl. Put your hands up!
- Please. Hey.

371
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,140
Save me.

372
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:34,242
What?

373
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:43,816
Give me the keys.

374
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,581
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

375
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,316
Help!

376
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,158
FBl! Took my weapon and my car.

377
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,762
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

378
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,704
CP, 17, can you repeat
possible suspect description?

379
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,832
Negative, no further at this time.

380
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,467
CP, this is 15.
No activity at my location.

381
00:30:09,578 --> 00:30:11,637
I am available to move if necessary.

382
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,078
Copy that.

383
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:19,216
This is Officer Timmons
requesting backup.

384
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:21,255
Pursuing suspect in assassination.

385
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:25,487
Now fleeing in stolen FBl vehicle,
moving south on Front from Diamond.

386
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:27,220
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
I repeat,

387
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:29,455
suspect is armed and dangerous.

388
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,931
All Philly PD units be advised,

389
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:34,935
assassination suspect is fleeing
in a stolen FBl vehicle.

390
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:37,733
He is going south
on Front from Diamond.

391
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,809
This is Condor 2. We are transitioning
from roadhouse to Front Street.

392
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,105
Please advise for further description
of suspect vehicle.

393
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:46,511
Dispatch, 419,
I'm heading south on Thompson.

394
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,674
Do we have a color,
anything on the vehicle?

395
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:56,951
Assassination suspect's vehicle

396
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,893
is one government-issue
black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.

397
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:06,662
Pennsylvania license number
7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.

398
00:31:07,336 --> 00:31:09,896
What was suspect's
last known location? Over.

399
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:12,200
Last known is south on Front.

400
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:22,041
This is Agent James. Do we have
multiple suspects or a single suspect?

401
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:26,648
Agent James, negative.
No further information...

402
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:30,385
This is Agent Pittman.
Car seen going high speed on Castor.

403
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:32,552
High speed on Castor. Be advised.

404
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:40,529
Timmons called it in?

405
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:42,866
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

406
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:44,701
- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

407
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:47,537
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

408
00:31:47,643 --> 00:31:48,769
it doesn't really matter.

409
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:52,837
They're going to find him lying dead
by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.

410
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:53,982
What is your location?

411
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:08,425
Suspect vehicle a black sedan,
four-door...

412
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,404
All units be advised,

413
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:28,950
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle
entering High-Tech Car Wash

414
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:31,884
on the northwest corner
of Girard and 9th, over.

415
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:32,954
Command Post be advised,

416
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:35,489
this is Condor Two en route
to suspect location, over.

417
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,082
Command Post, Condor Three copies.
All en route.

418
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:44,560
- Yo, man!
- Watch it, man!

419
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:05,945
Shit!

420
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:25,598
Command Post, Condors Two
and Three moving to intercept, over.

421
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,967
Suspect vehicle collided with a truck
under the 95.

422
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:02,873
He's at Market and Columbus.

423
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,213
Looks good. Vehicle is disabled.
Repeat, vehicle disabled.

424
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:20,219
Take him down! Fire!

425
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:48,586
I got a Crown Vic. Black.
Government plates.

426
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:50,784
Dead guy in the front seat?

427
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:58,392
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

428
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,568
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

429
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:24,918
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

430
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,592
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

431
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:10,731
The would-be assassin,
tentatively identified

432
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:14,325
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

433
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:18,998
is being pursued by thousands of State
and Federal law enforcement personnel

434
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:20,302
as we speak.

435
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:24,140
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

436
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:26,544
Nothing but an abandoned car
has been found

437
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:28,513
at the bottom of the Delaware River.

438
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:32,246
Seven-year veteran Philadelphia
police officer Stanley Timmons,

439
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:33,844
first to respond to the scene,

440
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:36,948
is believed to have shot
and injured Swagger.

441
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,220
Early reports indicate that the assailant

442
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:42,320
may have been hit
as many as two times.

443
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:45,161
Meanwhile, the FBl has been
unwilling to comment

444
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,565
on information that an agent of theirs

445
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:51,799
was assaulted and disarmed
by Swagger as he fled the scene,

446
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:54,375
possibly in a stolen FBl vehicle.

447
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:58,003
At this time, no sign of Swagger
has been found.

448
00:37:58,113 --> 00:38:00,172
You have embarrassed this office.

449
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:04,685
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

450
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:05,775
Sir...

451
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,086
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

452
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:11,125
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

453
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:14,127
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

454
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:17,392
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

455
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,340
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

456
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:28,807
Because he didn't.

457
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:35,548
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

458
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:36,982
He never said that.

459
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:39,212
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

460
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,811
You got your ass kicked.

461
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:42,322
You're misremembering.

462
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:45,156
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

463
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:48,061
Have you given
your official statement yet?

464
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:51,155
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

465
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:55,430
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

466
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:57,705
Can you believe this fucking guy?

467
00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:01,302
There you go.

468
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:03,166
- Yes?
- The raw feeds are in

469
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:04,176
from the networks.

470
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:26,126
...development, security camera footage
from Washington, D.C.

471
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:28,203
and several locations in Philadelphia

472
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:31,534
shows the suspect,
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,

473
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,599
scouting shooting locations,
traveling and taking wind readings.

474
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:40,578
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

475
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:11,372
Excuse me.

476
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,574
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

477
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,913
Please. I got cash,
and you can keep the change.

478
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,748
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

479
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,322
Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

480
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:22,890
couple bottles of water.

481
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:24,814
How many?

482
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:13,898
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

484
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:19,444
but we don't take care
of those things here.

485
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:21,607
- Yeah. Okay, well...
- The FBl released a video letter...

486
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:23,742
- ... see a counselor.
- ... threatening the life of the President...

487
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:24,876
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

488
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:27,250
...signed and dated
by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

489
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:29,950
Federal agents today
executed a search warrant

490
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:32,253
in the Wind River range of Wyoming

491
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:35,262
where Swagger had been living
for several years.

492
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:38,765
In the meantime, the FBl
has been unwilling to comment,

493
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:41,199
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

494
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:44,501
- Get anything?
- No.

495
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,963
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

496
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:01,506
And? Yes?

497
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:04,779
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

498
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:06,217
- What'd he buy?
- Gotta be.

499
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:09,313
Salt, sugar, water,
and a marinade injector.

500
00:43:09,424 --> 00:43:10,789
Guy going to a barbecue.

501
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,486
Salt, water, an injector could be used
for an IV,

502
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:14,652
but what's with the sugar?

503
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:16,025
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

504
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:17,723
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

505
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:18,800
for hundreds of years.

506
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,130
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

507
00:43:21,236 --> 00:43:23,670
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

508
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:26,240
You go into Howard's office
with the Napoleonic War,

509
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:27,535
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

510
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:29,872
Go back to your desk.
I'm saving your life.

511
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:52,800
One thing is...

512
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,767
...1790 to 1800.

513
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,077
One thing is...

514
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,681
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

515
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:22,222
I know who you are.

516
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:25,191
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

517
00:45:25,293 --> 00:45:27,921
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

518
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:29,121
I know.

519
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,219
You do?

520
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:33,859
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

521
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:38,464
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

522
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,333
Look, you're a nurse, right?

523
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:45,038
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

524
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:46,340
I teach the third grade.

525
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:48,640
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

526
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,842
Please.

527
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:51,109
Please?

528
00:45:51,453 --> 00:45:53,444
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

529
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:55,022
I swear.

530
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:57,753
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

531
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:00,384
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

532
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:06,561
You still figuring on shooting me?

533
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:09,466
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

534
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:12,699
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

535
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:14,775
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

536
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:21,744
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

537
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,374
You'd best call me Sarah.

538
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:24,679
All right.

539
00:46:40,001 --> 00:46:42,162
911, what's your emergency?

540
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:11,889
Hello?

541
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,831
This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.

542
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:16,460
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over
the trash cans

543
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,062
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

544
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:20,141
Okay, then.

545
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:29,410
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

546
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:31,576
they call you back right away.

547
00:47:37,826 --> 00:47:40,192
I should've come
and seen you in person.

548
00:47:43,264 --> 00:47:45,596
Before. I mean, then.

549
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,065
Yeah, I read the letter.

550
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:50,434
It was okay.

551
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:54,702
And once a year I got the flowers.

552
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:58,735
You don't look real good.

553
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:04,049
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

554
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:06,120
Why aren't you?

555
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:08,587
Well, the U.S. government spent
a lot of time and money

556
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,487
teaching me how not to die

557
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:13,083
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

558
00:48:14,462 --> 00:48:16,794
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

559
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:22,264
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

560
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,337
Yeah.

561
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:35,272
You got to try to spread it out.

562
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:37,749
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

563
00:48:46,146 --> 00:48:48,979
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

564
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:54,513
Mileage can be rough.

565
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,662
No one ever beats me in.

566
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:16,304
You never left.

567
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,337
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

568
00:49:19,446 --> 00:49:22,574
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

569
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,118
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

570
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:29,614
Where did all this stuff come from?

571
00:49:30,357 --> 00:49:33,417
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

572
00:49:33,527 --> 00:49:37,429
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

573
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:41,934
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

574
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:44,833
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

575
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:46,565
You need to get some sleep.

576
00:49:46,673 --> 00:49:49,437
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

577
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:51,374
22 minutes after the shooting.

578
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:52,502
We're good at our jobs.

579
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:55,080
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

580
00:49:55,182 --> 00:49:56,308
The scene was locked down.

581
00:49:57,651 --> 00:50:00,916
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

582
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:02,113
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

583
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:03,553
We're not that good at our jobs.

584
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:06,016
- You want to see something?
- Probably not.

585
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:07,491
I downloaded this.

586
00:50:07,594 --> 00:50:08,720
This is a full-scale printout

587
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:11,821
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

588
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:15,197
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

589
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:20,035
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

590
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,334
Five shots,

591
00:50:21,675 --> 00:50:22,903
at 1,000 yards,

592
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:25,407
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

593
00:50:27,781 --> 00:50:29,271
It was the capital of the United States...

594
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:32,910
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

595
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:34,452
This is the wind speed and direction

596
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:35,816
according to the
National Weather Service

597
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:38,220
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

598
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:40,953
Now, how does a man who can do that

599
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:45,026
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

600
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:46,825
I don't get it.

601
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:49,766
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

602
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,997
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

603
00:50:52,105 --> 00:50:54,335
He said he was walking foot patrol,

604
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:57,035
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

605
00:50:57,144 --> 00:50:59,977
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

606
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,980
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

607
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:04,846
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

608
00:51:05,218 --> 00:51:07,152
It doesn't make any sense.

609
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:11,050
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

610
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:13,251
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

611
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:16,857
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

612
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:23,026
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

613
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,535
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

614
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:27,630
Bad things happen to good people.

615
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:28,765
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

616
00:51:34,815 --> 00:51:37,215
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

617
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:40,381
But it'll cut loose again.

618
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:43,786
I held off the worst of the infection,
but you're gonna have to open it up,

619
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,688
cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

620
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:49,660
working your way out,
sewing it together

621
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:52,561
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

622
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:56,434
You ready for this?

623
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:01,468
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s
and pass out.

624
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:05,975
Good luck, okay?

625
00:53:19,953 --> 00:53:23,354
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

626
00:53:23,456 --> 00:53:24,889
That our guy in the collar?

627
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,219
Whose president?

628
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:27,725
I didn't say 'execute'.

629
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:30,728
He's getting a medal. Know it?

630
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,060
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

631
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,960
You need to find the shooter.

632
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:43,276
No.

633
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:39,251
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

634
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,758
Find me something.

635
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,021
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

636
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,891
He's not dead.

637
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:49,133
Tear apart his life.

638
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:50,566
Again.

639
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:56,833
Go okay?

640
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:03,547
I've been hallucinating.

641
00:56:06,553 --> 00:56:08,487
Something I need to tell you.

642
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:13,556
Ralphie's dead.

643
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,888
Who's Ralphie?

644
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:17,462
Well, they said you shot your dog

645
00:56:17,564 --> 00:56:19,464
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

646
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:21,033
They said that, huh?

647
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:26,871
Name was Sam.

648
00:56:27,974 --> 00:56:30,442
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

649
00:56:34,514 --> 00:56:35,708
You okay?

650
00:56:37,684 --> 00:56:38,651
No.

651
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:41,514
What are you gonna do?

652
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:44,650
I'll get better.

653
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:49,017
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

654
00:57:24,898 --> 00:57:25,990
Can I help you?

655
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:56,120
Hold still.

656
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,605
I been meaning to ask you.

657
00:58:10,343 --> 00:58:12,004
You have a boyfriend?

658
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:15,071
Why?

659
00:58:16,282 --> 00:58:18,876
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

660
00:58:18,985 --> 00:58:20,646
It's been three years.

661
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:21,720
No.

662
00:58:22,288 --> 00:58:23,721
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

663
00:58:23,823 --> 00:58:24,983
walks through that door
without knocking,

664
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:27,025
wondering where you've been.

665
00:58:29,295 --> 00:58:30,887
Well, no.

666
00:58:30,997 --> 00:58:33,227
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

667
00:58:57,724 --> 00:58:59,021
Not bad.

668
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:01,954
A little stiff, but...

669
00:59:03,763 --> 00:59:04,730
Hey.

670
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:08,661
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

671
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:11,768
That was really brave, what you did.

672
00:59:12,138 --> 00:59:13,298
You saved my life.

673
00:59:17,343 --> 00:59:20,005
I'm better. I better get to it.

674
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:22,445
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

675
00:59:23,549 --> 00:59:24,641
Never.

676
00:59:25,919 --> 00:59:28,080
They're never gonna stop looking.

677
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:33,221
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

678
00:59:33,326 --> 00:59:34,816
I'm going to give them him.

679
00:59:34,928 --> 00:59:36,395
Excuse me?

680
00:59:37,563 --> 00:59:40,657
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

681
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:51,040
- Swagger?
- Hey.

682
01:00:00,853 --> 01:00:03,583
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

683
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:08,761
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

684
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:11,295
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

685
01:00:11,397 --> 01:00:12,455
You sure?

686
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,667
Yeah.

687
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:20,370
Why'd you go?

688
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,903
When they came to see you.

689
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,472
They know which buttons to press.

690
01:00:28,314 --> 01:00:30,373
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

691
01:00:30,483 --> 01:00:34,078
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
'Which way you want me to go, boss?'

692
01:00:34,187 --> 01:00:37,816
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

693
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:40,557
You know, I got a plan,

694
01:00:41,995 --> 01:00:44,259
but I think I'm going to need your help.

695
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,364
Okay. I'll do it.

696
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:49,398
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

697
01:00:49,969 --> 01:00:51,095
I know.

698
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:00,070
Look.

699
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:02,382
It was my fault.

700
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:06,151
What?

701
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:11,883
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

702
01:01:18,965 --> 01:01:19,954
What?

703
01:01:25,138 --> 01:01:26,765
Don't you dare.

704
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:31,868
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

705
01:01:32,912 --> 01:01:36,643
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

706
01:01:36,749 --> 01:01:37,841
He knew exactly what he was doing

707
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:40,714
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

708
01:01:42,455 --> 01:01:44,389
He loved what he did.

709
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,458
No one made him do it.

710
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:51,022
That ain't yours to carry.

711
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:55,561
You're right.

712
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,603
I'm sorry I tried.

713
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:25,759
It's okay.

714
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,035
I need you to meet with this FBl agent.

715
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,904
Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.

716
01:02:37,009 --> 01:02:41,002
Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.

717
01:02:41,114 --> 01:02:43,582
You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.

718
01:02:43,883 --> 01:02:45,475
You get caught, I get caught.

719
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:47,143
You know what that is?

720
01:02:48,921 --> 01:02:51,651
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

721
01:02:51,757 --> 01:02:53,054
Well, he's been staying with me.

722
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:55,218
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

723
01:03:03,936 --> 01:03:07,929
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

724
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,632
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

725
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:12,973
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

726
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:17,114
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

727
01:03:48,748 --> 01:03:49,942
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

728
01:04:15,641 --> 01:04:17,541
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

729
01:04:24,784 --> 01:04:27,116
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

730
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,380
and show me some ID.

731
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:34,083
I'm not gonna ask you again.

732
01:04:35,494 --> 01:04:37,257
Take your hat off, asshole!

733
01:04:46,372 --> 01:04:49,205
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

734
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,769
Hey, how's it going?

735
01:05:25,578 --> 01:05:26,772
Hey, John.

736
01:05:50,303 --> 01:05:51,497
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

737
01:05:51,604 --> 01:05:53,538
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

738
01:05:56,008 --> 01:05:59,171
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

739
01:05:59,512 --> 01:06:05,212
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

740
01:06:05,318 --> 01:06:07,309
in 45 minutes for a review.

741
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:10,446
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

742
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:13,625
What do you think?

743
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:16,761
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

744
01:06:16,862 --> 01:06:19,194
already edited together
to show the angles.

745
01:06:19,298 --> 01:06:20,390
Who delivered them?

746
01:06:20,499 --> 01:06:23,900
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

747
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:25,971
They denied, which is a...

748
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:31,737
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

749
01:06:31,844 --> 01:06:33,675
Of what?

750
01:06:33,779 --> 01:06:37,306
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

751
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:38,542
Oh, come on, just tell me.

752
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:40,141
You don't want to be here
for that review.

753
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:43,813
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

754
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:56,396
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

755
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:00,735
- Thank you.
- Go.

756
01:07:07,913 --> 01:07:09,904
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

757
01:07:10,015 --> 01:07:13,109
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

758
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:15,687
We just traced it to a donut shop
with free WiFi.

759
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:18,552
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

760
01:07:18,657 --> 01:07:21,455
out of the FBl field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

761
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,154
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the donut shop

762
01:07:24,263 --> 01:07:26,788
only three blocks away
from the field office.

763
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:29,959
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

764
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:31,263
He lives in Philly.

765
01:07:31,504 --> 01:07:32,937
And he works for the FBl.

766
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,571
Nicholas Memphis.

767
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:39,466
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

768
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:42,411
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

769
01:07:42,515 --> 01:07:44,312
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

770
01:07:44,417 --> 01:07:45,406
They're definitely not government,

771
01:07:45,518 --> 01:07:48,248
but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.

772
01:07:48,354 --> 01:07:49,548
These are contractors.

773
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:52,146
I can't tell
what this company does, but...

774
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:55,015
Hey.

775
01:07:55,127 --> 01:07:56,094
Hey, hey, hey!

776
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,260
Memphis?

777
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:03,335
Memphis!

778
01:08:10,576 --> 01:08:12,441
For a man who didn't know much,

779
01:08:12,545 --> 01:08:15,844
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

780
01:08:15,948 --> 01:08:17,540
Get him some water.

781
01:08:26,692 --> 01:08:27,750
Good.

782
01:08:38,304 --> 01:08:39,532
Got to pee yet?

783
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:41,503
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

784
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:43,905
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

785
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:46,273
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

786
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:48,312
I'm not going to shoot myself.

787
01:08:49,148 --> 01:08:50,240
Sure you will.

788
01:08:51,283 --> 01:08:52,716
Take him out. Get him ready.

789
01:08:52,818 --> 01:08:53,785
No!

790
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:00,651
That's my gun.

791
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:01,783
Yeah.

792
01:09:02,328 --> 01:09:04,762
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

793
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:07,196
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

794
01:09:14,273 --> 01:09:15,797
Quit your struggling.

795
01:09:19,411 --> 01:09:23,211
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

796
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,415
Russo. Russo!

797
01:09:29,522 --> 01:09:31,149
Davis, get out here!

798
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:38,122
What is the goddamn hold-up?

799
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:18,932
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

800
01:10:19,038 --> 01:10:20,130
Kill you?

801
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,867
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

802
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:26,907
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

803
01:10:35,154 --> 01:10:38,385
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

804
01:10:39,692 --> 01:10:41,819
Help me toss these boys in the water?

805
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:44,225
You set me up and you used me as bait!

806
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:47,163
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

807
01:10:47,266 --> 01:10:48,290
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

808
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,493
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

809
01:10:50,603 --> 01:10:52,833
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

810
01:10:52,938 --> 01:10:54,872
They can work out some kind of deal.

811
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:58,708
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

812
01:10:58,811 --> 01:10:59,937
I don't think you understand.

813
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:01,239
These boys killed my dog.

814
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:07,084
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

815
01:11:07,186 --> 01:11:08,744
In the end, the law is all...

816
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:11,550
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

817
01:11:11,657 --> 01:11:12,954
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

818
01:11:13,058 --> 01:11:15,583
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

819
01:11:15,828 --> 01:11:16,988
And I'll be dead.

820
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:19,030
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

821
01:11:19,131 --> 01:11:21,224
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

822
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:24,564
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

823
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:27,161
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

824
01:11:30,442 --> 01:11:31,807
You know, I missed a meeting today

825
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:35,368
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

826
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:38,473
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

827
01:11:43,122 --> 01:11:44,521
I'll take his legs.

828
01:11:44,623 --> 01:11:46,284
It's a good call, Pork.

829
01:11:46,859 --> 01:11:49,657
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBl agent

830
01:11:49,762 --> 01:11:51,559
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

831
01:11:51,664 --> 01:11:52,631
No.

832
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:57,267
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

833
01:11:59,138 --> 01:12:00,400
With a.22.

834
01:12:02,374 --> 01:12:04,604
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

835
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:06,143
And that young kid,

836
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:07,969
FBl Agent

837
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:11,643
Nick Memphis,

838
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,550
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

839
01:12:15,654 --> 01:12:19,385
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

840
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,527
What?

841
01:12:22,628 --> 01:12:24,789
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

842
01:12:25,264 --> 01:12:28,927
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

843
01:12:29,134 --> 01:12:31,534
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

844
01:12:31,637 --> 01:12:34,800
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

845
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:36,101
She went back to using
her maiden name,

846
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,438
which is why we missed it the first time.

847
01:12:39,611 --> 01:12:41,374
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

848
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,539
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

849
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:47,050
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

850
01:12:47,152 --> 01:12:48,813
It's just within driving range.

851
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:52,484
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

852
01:13:00,265 --> 01:13:01,960
We've given Swagger a new war,

853
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:03,868
he's found a new spotter.

854
01:13:05,237 --> 01:13:06,864
This is about to get worse.

855
01:13:35,968 --> 01:13:37,595
I think we're here.

856
01:13:38,737 --> 01:13:39,965
Hey. Swagger.

857
01:13:44,376 --> 01:13:45,809
I think we're here.

858
01:13:48,914 --> 01:13:51,041
Welcome to Tennessee.

859
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,277
Patron state of shooting stuff.

860
01:13:55,554 --> 01:13:56,987
Hey, who is this guy?

861
01:13:57,089 --> 01:14:00,616
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

862
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:02,785
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

863
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:03,953
than Smith % Wesson.

864
01:14:04,062 --> 01:14:06,553
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

865
01:14:06,665 --> 01:14:07,825
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

866
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:11,528
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

867
01:14:11,837 --> 01:14:12,929
Wisdom.

868
01:14:14,973 --> 01:14:16,600
You come to the wrong place.

869
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:17,970
Maybe.

870
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:19,668
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

871
01:14:19,778 --> 01:14:21,439
and have it match exactly to another.

872
01:14:21,547 --> 01:14:22,912
Could that be done?

873
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:24,039
Take a seat.

874
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:26,145
Have a chair, son.

875
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:34,381
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

876
01:14:34,493 --> 01:14:35,983
could make the grooves match.

877
01:14:36,094 --> 01:14:38,426
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

878
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,054
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

879
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:41,723
was completely mangled on impact.

880
01:14:41,834 --> 01:14:44,064
FBl match was metallurgical.

881
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:45,329
Thank you, Mother.

882
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:47,837
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

883
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,431
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

884
01:14:53,378 --> 01:14:54,936
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

885
01:14:56,949 --> 01:15:00,112
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

886
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:03,214
Red leather spine.

887
01:15:03,422 --> 01:15:06,289
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

888
01:15:07,526 --> 01:15:11,360
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

889
01:15:31,049 --> 01:15:33,279
Yeah. Paper patching.

890
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:36,548
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

891
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:37,883
Paper-wrapped bullet.

892
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:40,515
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

893
01:15:40,626 --> 01:15:43,652
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

894
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:45,787
Leaves no traces when it hits.

895
01:15:45,898 --> 01:15:49,527
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

896
01:15:49,635 --> 01:15:50,932
I got another one.

897
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,694
I thought you might.

898
01:15:52,804 --> 01:15:55,796
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

899
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:57,603
Who's alive that could do that?

900
01:15:58,176 --> 01:16:02,306
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

901
01:16:02,414 --> 01:16:05,542
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

902
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:06,764
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

903
01:16:06,799 --> 01:16:07,878
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

904
01:16:07,986 --> 01:16:09,453
Yeah, they said that, all right.

905
01:16:09,554 --> 01:16:13,251
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

906
01:16:14,259 --> 01:16:16,784
and WMDs were in Iraq,

907
01:16:16,895 --> 01:16:19,557
and Anna Nicole married for love!

908
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,398
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

909
01:16:23,502 --> 01:16:24,560
How come?

910
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:27,230
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

911
01:16:27,339 --> 01:16:29,239
That's how a conspiracy works.

912
01:16:29,341 --> 01:16:32,970
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

913
01:16:33,078 --> 01:16:37,014
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

914
01:16:37,115 --> 01:16:38,548
And you know this for a fact?

915
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,447
Still got the shovel.

916
01:16:42,621 --> 01:16:44,452
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

917
01:16:44,556 --> 01:16:46,080
There was a guy in Russia.

918
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:47,954
They locked his ass up.

919
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,322
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

920
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:54,095
There was one guy,

921
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:56,463
but he don't shoot no more.

922
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:59,599
A brutal son of a bitch.

923
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:02,833
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

924
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:05,270
wait till his friends come to help,

925
01:17:05,677 --> 01:17:06,837
kill them too.

926
01:17:06,945 --> 01:17:09,106
Turned one target into four.

927
01:17:09,881 --> 01:17:13,612
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

928
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:15,983
The other side wanted him. Bad.

929
01:17:16,088 --> 01:17:21,390
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-story building.

930
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:24,528
They quit the subtle tactics.

931
01:17:24,629 --> 01:17:27,257
They called in an artillery strike.

932
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:29,266
Leveled a square block.

933
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:31,529
Brought the building down on his ass.

934
01:17:31,636 --> 01:17:34,070
Some say he crawled out of there.

935
01:17:34,172 --> 01:17:35,901
Some say he died.

936
01:17:36,008 --> 01:17:37,942
Never heard from him no more.

937
01:17:38,643 --> 01:17:40,201
Fuck me.

938
01:17:40,312 --> 01:17:41,301
What?

939
01:17:41,413 --> 01:17:42,846
I met the son of a bitch.

940
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:50,345
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

941
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:52,449
No, sir.

942
01:17:52,557 --> 01:17:54,149
You keep that in mind.

943
01:17:54,259 --> 01:17:56,022
The moment you think you got it figured,

944
01:17:56,194 --> 01:17:57,161
you're wrong.

945
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:02,291
He got a name?

946
01:18:07,806 --> 01:18:09,239
Hey, it's me, Nick.

947
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:12,276
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

948
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:15,002
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

949
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:16,341
It's better I don't tell you.

950
01:18:17,182 --> 01:18:19,548
Look, do you have a pen?

951
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:22,119
I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

952
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,187
- Yeah.
- You got it?

953
01:18:23,288 --> 01:18:24,277
I got it.

954
01:18:24,423 --> 01:18:26,254
Man, this is hard to spell.

955
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:35,627
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

956
01:18:35,734 --> 01:18:37,998
He'll try to track the shooter.

957
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:39,627
He won't get far that way.

958
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:41,228
Yes, he will.

959
01:18:41,339 --> 01:18:43,432
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

960
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:46,602
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

961
01:18:53,752 --> 01:18:55,447
And what happens to the bait?

962
01:18:56,988 --> 01:18:58,353
Hard to say.

963
01:18:59,357 --> 01:19:02,019
But that's the nature of being the bait.

964
01:19:15,073 --> 01:19:17,439
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?
- He's in Virginia.

965
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,603
An end we thought was tied up

966
01:19:20,812 --> 01:19:21,904
came untied.

967
01:19:22,848 --> 01:19:24,509
Meaning, Colonel?

968
01:19:24,616 --> 01:19:26,447
Swagger is still alive.

969
01:19:29,888 --> 01:19:31,253
Oh, my.

970
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:36,520
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

971
01:19:38,196 --> 01:19:41,791
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

972
01:19:43,602 --> 01:19:45,365
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

973
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,462
Twenty-four good, hard men.

974
01:19:48,573 --> 01:19:50,734
Weapons and gear.

975
01:19:50,842 --> 01:19:52,366
Only 24?

976
01:19:53,812 --> 01:19:55,211
Do kill him.

977
01:19:56,948 --> 01:19:58,882
No loose ends this time.

978
01:19:59,784 --> 01:20:01,183
Night, Colonel.

979
01:20:02,854 --> 01:20:03,843
Good night, Senator.

980
01:20:22,707 --> 01:20:23,765
Hello?

981
01:20:25,977 --> 01:20:27,376
Someone there?

982
01:21:03,648 --> 01:21:04,774
Now look.

983
01:21:05,483 --> 01:21:07,280
Look what you've done now.

984
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:11,988
Give me that.

985
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,082
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

986
01:21:23,602 --> 01:21:25,433
Where's your boyfriend?

987
01:21:27,672 --> 01:21:29,264
What if it's a trap?

988
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,073
Oh, it's a trap.

989
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:33,508
Guaranteed. Every time.

990
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,075
Question is, for whom?

991
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,414
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

992
01:21:40,518 --> 01:21:42,748
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

993
01:22:10,815 --> 01:22:11,782
Let's go.

994
01:22:17,322 --> 01:22:19,347
Okay, so what are these for again?

995
01:22:20,058 --> 01:22:21,753
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

996
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,418
Right.

997
01:22:23,528 --> 01:22:27,760
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

998
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:31,893
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

999
01:22:32,003 --> 01:22:34,164
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

1000
01:22:34,272 --> 01:22:35,705
For as much as we can be.

1001
01:22:48,853 --> 01:22:51,083
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

1002
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:52,918
Take them one by one.

1003
01:22:53,024 --> 01:22:54,958
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

1004
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:04,626
Fuck!

1005
01:23:06,938 --> 01:23:09,372
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

1006
01:23:09,474 --> 01:23:11,999
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

1007
01:23:28,093 --> 01:23:29,617
No. No.

1008
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:31,992
It's just you and me, baby.

1009
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:33,155
No!

1010
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:37,701
You got three guards.

1011
01:23:38,603 --> 01:23:40,036
One at your 2:00,

1012
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:42,531
12:00

1013
01:23:43,908 --> 01:23:45,034
and 10:00.

1014
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:54,675
Danger close. 2:00,

1015
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:55,753
fifty yards.

1016
01:24:59,384 --> 01:25:00,442
You got one right on you.

1017
01:25:00,885 --> 01:25:01,852
20 yards and closing.

1018
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:53,969
Go check the perimeter.

1019
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:55,929
And tell the others to stay alert.

1020
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,769
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1021
01:26:31,943 --> 01:26:33,433
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1022
01:26:52,163 --> 01:26:53,460
You killed all three?

1023
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:55,730
There were four.

1024
01:26:56,668 --> 01:27:00,126
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1025
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:02,103
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

1026
01:27:02,206 --> 01:27:03,639
to kill the Archbishop.

1027
01:27:04,576 --> 01:27:06,066
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1028
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:08,236
And if I don't know any of those things?

1029
01:27:08,346 --> 01:27:09,438
Then you're of no worth to me

1030
01:27:09,547 --> 01:27:11,708
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1031
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,320
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1032
01:27:18,423 --> 01:27:22,189
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1033
01:27:22,293 --> 01:27:24,022
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1034
01:27:25,697 --> 01:27:27,221
He's ex-army.

1035
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:29,766
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1036
01:27:33,071 --> 01:27:34,163
Go on.

1037
01:27:36,007 --> 01:27:38,771
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1038
01:27:39,944 --> 01:27:42,344
Recruitment for a single job.

1039
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:45,481
They like the wounded.

1040
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:48,245
Easier to use

1041
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:51,255
and then throw away
when you are done.

1042
01:27:52,657 --> 01:27:54,648
Timmons, you, me...

1043
01:27:57,295 --> 01:28:02,232
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1044
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:08,101
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1045
01:28:09,173 --> 01:28:10,504
And the Archbishop?

1046
01:28:12,143 --> 01:28:15,977
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1047
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:18,647
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1048
01:28:20,084 --> 01:28:21,517
What was he going to say?

1049
01:28:22,553 --> 01:28:23,884
The truth.

1050
01:28:23,988 --> 01:28:27,549
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1051
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:31,151
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1052
01:28:31,262 --> 01:28:33,253
Over there, and here.

1053
01:28:35,366 --> 01:28:37,163
The problem isn't the doing.

1054
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:40,763
It's the people in power having to admit

1055
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:42,331
that they knew.

1056
01:28:44,108 --> 01:28:46,906
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1057
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,172
and only the underlings go to jail.

1058
01:28:49,914 --> 01:28:51,506
Their bosses knew.

1059
01:28:51,616 --> 01:28:53,743
We know their bosses knew.

1060
01:28:53,851 --> 01:28:55,079
But you don't say it.

1061
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:56,915
What exactly happened in Africa?

1062
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:59,512
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1063
01:28:59,757 --> 01:29:01,657
that an oil pipeline

1064
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,024
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1065
01:29:05,129 --> 01:29:08,565
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1066
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:09,633
Drink?

1067
01:29:09,734 --> 01:29:10,792
So they asked them all nicely to move

1068
01:29:10,902 --> 01:29:12,267
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1069
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:13,337
No.

1070
01:29:13,571 --> 01:29:14,799
They didn't ask.

1071
01:29:15,173 --> 01:29:16,538
They just killed them.

1072
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:17,608
All.

1073
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,844
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1074
01:29:20,945 --> 01:29:22,276
They'll just go.

1075
01:29:34,092 --> 01:29:38,324
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1076
01:29:38,429 --> 01:29:42,126
men, women, children,

1077
01:29:42,233 --> 01:29:46,863
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

1078
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,072
You should know.

1079
01:29:50,174 --> 01:29:54,201
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1080
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:58,344
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

1081
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:08,652
Who runs Johnson?

1082
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:09,956
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1083
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:11,152
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1084
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:14,357
You don't get it.

1085
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:16,892
There is no head to cut off.

1086
01:30:18,069 --> 01:30:19,866
It's a conglomerate.

1087
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:23,269
If one of them betrays the principles

1088
01:30:24,776 --> 01:30:27,006
of the accrual of money and power,

1089
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:29,807
the others betray him.

1090
01:30:30,915 --> 01:30:32,439
What it is

1091
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,017
is human weakness.

1092
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:41,290
You can't kill that with a gun.

1093
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,167
Swagger.

1094
01:30:50,268 --> 01:30:51,257
Swagger.

1095
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:54,167
You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.

1096
01:30:54,972 --> 01:30:58,066
Had to keep you till they got here.

1097
01:30:59,544 --> 01:31:02,843
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1098
01:31:03,614 --> 01:31:05,172
You would have known.

1099
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:13,453
By the way, they've got your woman.

1100
01:31:16,527 --> 01:31:17,585
Swagger.

1101
01:31:17,695 --> 01:31:21,153
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1102
01:31:22,934 --> 01:31:24,834
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
- Roger that.

1103
01:31:56,901 --> 01:31:58,562
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1104
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:00,596
You got to get out of there.

1105
01:32:00,705 --> 01:32:02,172
- They're all over the place.
- Hey!

1106
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:04,172
Calm down.

1107
01:32:04,275 --> 01:32:06,766
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1108
01:32:07,078 --> 01:32:08,875
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1109
01:32:16,454 --> 01:32:17,421
Listen very carefully.

1110
01:32:17,588 --> 01:32:19,215
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1111
01:32:19,323 --> 01:32:20,290
then the gas.

1112
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:23,088
Three, two, one...

1113
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,116
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1114
01:33:49,246 --> 01:33:50,235
Swagger!

1115
01:33:57,488 --> 01:33:58,785
You got it.

1116
01:34:10,134 --> 01:34:11,294
Swagger!

1117
01:34:13,704 --> 01:34:15,262
Swagger!

1118
01:34:15,973 --> 01:34:17,304
Swagger!

1119
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:25,779
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1120
01:34:25,883 --> 01:34:26,850
Okay.

1121
01:34:26,951 --> 01:34:28,009
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1122
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:29,143
Go!

1123
01:34:32,623 --> 01:34:33,590
Come on!

1124
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:03,281
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1125
01:35:03,587 --> 01:35:04,554
What?

1126
01:35:04,722 --> 01:35:06,587
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1127
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:08,021
Okay. Okay.

1128
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,990
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

1129
01:35:11,762 --> 01:35:12,751
All right, go!

1130
01:35:26,177 --> 01:35:27,667
Pull up! Pull up!

1131
01:35:43,727 --> 01:35:44,716
Time to go!

1132
01:36:02,613 --> 01:36:03,545
Let me take a look.

1133
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:04,948
Not right now.

1134
01:36:05,549 --> 01:36:06,846
Morning, beautiful.

1135
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:09,181
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

1136
01:36:09,286 --> 01:36:13,620
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1137
01:36:13,724 --> 01:36:17,353
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

1138
01:36:17,461 --> 01:36:20,692
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1139
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,936
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1140
01:36:26,403 --> 01:36:27,802
of the FBl.

1141
01:36:28,105 --> 01:36:29,629
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1142
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:36,435
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1143
01:36:38,816 --> 01:36:40,044
what the fuck is going on?

1144
01:36:46,056 --> 01:36:47,387
Great shot!

1145
01:36:50,928 --> 01:36:53,453
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

1146
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:56,829
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1147
01:36:58,435 --> 01:36:59,902
Think what you want.

1148
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:06,398
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1149
01:37:08,212 --> 01:37:10,203
There's always a confused soul

1150
01:37:10,314 --> 01:37:12,908
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1151
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:17,212
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1152
01:37:19,557 --> 01:37:21,525
That's the hassle with democracy.

1153
01:37:22,026 --> 01:37:23,050
Pull!

1154
01:37:37,408 --> 01:37:39,342
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1155
01:37:39,443 --> 01:37:41,001
We need those results now.

1156
01:37:41,111 --> 01:37:43,443
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna!... to the roadhouse.

1157
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:46,141
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1158
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:49,413
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1159
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,748
Start a trace.

1160
01:37:51,655 --> 01:37:53,247
Got it. I'm on it.

1161
01:37:53,357 --> 01:37:55,587
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1162
01:37:55,859 --> 01:37:58,987
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1163
01:38:00,097 --> 01:38:02,031
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1164
01:38:02,132 --> 01:38:04,726
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1165
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:06,697
Got him.

1166
01:38:06,804 --> 01:38:08,431
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1167
01:38:08,539 --> 01:38:11,337
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1168
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:15,811
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1169
01:38:15,913 --> 01:38:17,813
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1170
01:38:17,915 --> 01:38:18,904
Why?

1171
01:38:19,016 --> 01:38:21,007
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1172
01:38:21,919 --> 01:38:24,285
- But we're the FBl, son.
- Yeah, I know.

1173
01:38:24,688 --> 01:38:25,814
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1174
01:38:26,123 --> 01:38:27,215
Oh, Nick, wait...

1175
01:38:27,324 --> 01:38:29,224
Son of a bitch.

1176
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:30,350
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

1177
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:31,553
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

1178
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:33,892
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

1179
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:40,637
This is Swagger.

1180
01:38:40,738 --> 01:38:42,433
- Colonel Johnson here.
- Figured you'd be listening.

1181
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:44,939
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
- Colonel?

1182
01:38:45,476 --> 01:38:46,443
If it is 'Colonel'?

1183
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:48,003
It is.

1184
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:52,539
- I have something you want.
- Well, it seems so do I.

1185
01:38:55,619 --> 01:39:00,386
Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

1186
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:03,187
Men, women, children.

1187
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:06,295
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1188
01:39:06,397 --> 01:39:07,864
I just want someone there I can trust.

1189
01:39:07,965 --> 01:39:10,559
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1190
01:39:10,668 --> 01:39:12,568
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1191
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:15,070
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

1192
01:39:15,172 --> 01:39:17,163
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1193
01:39:17,274 --> 01:39:20,607
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1194
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:24,203
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1195
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:26,979
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

1196
01:39:27,284 --> 01:39:28,512
from Montana?

1197
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:31,452
Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?

1198
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:34,485
I don't think so.

1199
01:39:34,591 --> 01:39:37,458
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1200
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:40,189
Point 732. Point 648.

1201
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:41,925
And what the hell is that?

1202
01:39:42,032 --> 01:39:45,195
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few meters of latitude and longitude,

1203
01:39:45,302 --> 01:39:47,293
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1204
01:39:47,404 --> 01:39:48,735
with 400 bodies underneath.

1205
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,634
Where are we meeting?

1206
01:39:52,309 --> 01:39:54,402
Somewhere I can see you,

1207
01:39:55,479 --> 01:39:58,243
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1208
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,081
Where's your boy?

1209
01:41:22,466 --> 01:41:24,093
Well, I'm here.

1210
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:33,934
He's here.

1211
01:41:34,044 --> 01:41:35,341
Look, look, look.

1212
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:38,205
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1213
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,983
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1214
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:00,566
Okay.

1215
01:42:44,114 --> 01:42:45,741
I think I broke a rib!

1216
01:42:47,384 --> 01:42:48,578
Don't move!

1217
01:42:49,019 --> 01:42:50,452
Is there anybody else?

1218
01:42:51,054 --> 01:42:52,021
No.

1219
01:43:18,949 --> 01:43:21,577
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1220
01:43:22,886 --> 01:43:24,877
You got no shot!

1221
01:43:24,988 --> 01:43:28,389
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1222
01:43:31,161 --> 01:43:32,856
You got no shot!

1223
01:43:33,497 --> 01:43:36,295
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1224
01:43:45,275 --> 01:43:46,936
It's over for you, buddy!

1225
01:43:51,982 --> 01:43:54,610
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1226
01:44:08,632 --> 01:44:10,156
Not bad!

1227
01:44:10,267 --> 01:44:12,462
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1228
01:44:14,905 --> 01:44:16,031
Christ.

1229
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:34,982
How can we help you?

1230
01:44:35,092 --> 01:44:37,253
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1231
01:44:37,361 --> 01:44:39,158
to bring this by here at 3:00 p. m.

1232
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:44,022
Let's move!

1233
01:45:12,929 --> 01:45:13,918
You all right?

1234
01:45:14,731 --> 01:45:15,698
Yeah.

1235
01:45:26,076 --> 01:45:27,043
Search him.

1236
01:45:27,144 --> 01:45:28,702
I don't carry a weapon,

1237
01:45:31,715 --> 01:45:32,943
ordinarily.

1238
01:45:33,517 --> 01:45:35,644
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1239
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,957
Pull the pilot.

1240
01:45:46,563 --> 01:45:48,656
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1241
01:45:48,765 --> 01:45:49,925
Put your gun down!

1242
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:51,159
Easy. Easy.

1243
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:02,669
Sarah.

1244
01:46:03,714 --> 01:46:05,341
Give me the gun.

1245
01:46:06,049 --> 01:46:07,812
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1246
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,354
You okay?

1247
01:46:18,528 --> 01:46:21,122
Put them up. Keep them up.

1248
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:22,789
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1249
01:46:23,867 --> 01:46:26,461
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1250
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:28,834
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1251
01:46:28,939 --> 01:46:29,906
You do, huh?

1252
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,032
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1253
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:36,702
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1254
01:46:36,813 --> 01:46:38,576
just as a preamble?

1255
01:46:38,682 --> 01:46:40,547
You got any plans after this?

1256
01:46:41,218 --> 01:46:45,655
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1257
01:46:45,756 --> 01:46:47,951
Work? For you?

1258
01:46:48,058 --> 01:46:51,824
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1259
01:46:51,928 --> 01:46:55,489
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1260
01:46:55,599 --> 01:46:57,658
And what side are you on?

1261
01:46:57,768 --> 01:47:00,635
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1262
01:47:00,737 --> 01:47:01,897
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1263
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:04,303
There's only haves and have-nots.

1264
01:47:04,407 --> 01:47:07,399
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1265
01:47:07,811 --> 01:47:11,008
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1266
01:47:11,114 --> 01:47:12,945
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1267
01:47:13,049 --> 01:47:14,038
so a pipeline could go through.

1268
01:47:14,151 --> 01:47:15,743
One village!

1269
01:47:15,852 --> 01:47:17,877
And it brought stability to the region.

1270
01:47:17,988 --> 01:47:21,151
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1271
01:47:21,258 --> 01:47:23,055
because their
grandmother's grandfather

1272
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,752
belonged to a different tribe.

1273
01:47:25,762 --> 01:47:27,252
They like us down there, boy.

1274
01:47:34,304 --> 01:47:36,397
This is a country

1275
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,335
where the Secretary of Defense

1276
01:47:41,511 --> 01:47:43,103
can go on TV

1277
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,607
and tell the American public,

1278
01:47:45,816 --> 01:47:49,445
oh, that 'This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!'

1279
01:47:50,253 --> 01:47:52,187
And nobody questions him,

1280
01:47:52,289 --> 01:47:53,722
because they don't want to hear
the answer

1281
01:47:53,824 --> 01:47:55,155
because it's a lie!

1282
01:47:57,594 --> 01:48:01,826
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1283
01:48:02,232 --> 01:48:03,893
Now are you on the inside,

1284
01:48:04,234 --> 01:48:05,531
or are you on the out?

1285
01:48:12,609 --> 01:48:13,940
It's the FBl!

1286
01:48:14,778 --> 01:48:16,370
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1287
01:48:19,115 --> 01:48:22,482
If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...

1288
01:48:22,586 --> 01:48:24,247
I don't think so, Senator.

1289
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:30,425
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

1290
01:48:30,861 --> 01:48:32,988
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

1291
01:48:33,096 --> 01:48:36,930
This stuffs plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1292
01:48:37,033 --> 01:48:40,491
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1293
01:48:40,604 --> 01:48:43,596
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1294
01:48:43,707 --> 01:48:45,231
I'm out, old man!

1295
01:48:45,342 --> 01:48:48,140
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1296
01:48:48,245 --> 01:48:49,542
You happy?

1297
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:55,613
Where do you think you're going?

1298
01:48:55,719 --> 01:48:57,152
Washington!

1299
01:48:57,254 --> 01:49:01,691
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. senator in the back?

1300
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:03,349
Lord knows I want to.

1301
01:49:04,227 --> 01:49:05,660
I didn't think so.

1302
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:08,124
Let him go.

1303
01:49:09,165 --> 01:49:10,792
They've got your rifle.

1304
01:49:12,402 --> 01:49:14,836
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1305
01:49:14,938 --> 01:49:16,599
Recovered at the site.

1306
01:49:23,947 --> 01:49:26,609
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1307
01:49:27,083 --> 01:49:29,574
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1308
01:49:29,686 --> 01:49:32,177
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1309
01:49:37,394 --> 01:49:38,520
I won.

1310
01:49:39,562 --> 01:49:40,927
You lost.

1311
01:49:41,731 --> 01:49:43,892
Get used to the idea, son.

1312
01:49:44,367 --> 01:49:45,800
I'm not your son.

1313
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:02,714
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

1314
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:06,380
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBl!
Don't shoot!

1315
01:50:06,489 --> 01:50:08,650
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

1316
01:50:09,259 --> 01:50:10,283
I said get down!

1317
01:50:29,646 --> 01:50:32,274
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

1318
01:50:32,382 --> 01:50:34,009
Thank you, sir.

1319
01:50:35,485 --> 01:50:37,146
Thanks for bringing her.

1320
01:50:42,692 --> 01:50:45,320
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1321
01:50:45,428 --> 01:50:47,726
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1322
01:50:51,468 --> 01:50:54,096
This is Attorney General Russert.

1323
01:50:55,105 --> 01:50:57,699
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

1324
01:50:57,807 --> 01:51:00,139
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1325
01:51:00,243 --> 01:51:02,404
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1326
01:51:02,512 --> 01:51:04,741
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1327
01:51:05,815 --> 01:51:09,046
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBl.

1328
01:51:09,152 --> 01:51:10,619
What the hell am I doing here?

1329
01:51:10,854 --> 01:51:12,947
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1330
01:51:13,423 --> 01:51:14,822
Call the Joint Chief.

1331
01:51:16,459 --> 01:51:17,756
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1332
01:51:17,861 --> 01:51:20,227
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1333
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:22,798
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1334
01:51:22,899 --> 01:51:24,389
telling me to let you go.

1335
01:51:24,501 --> 01:51:27,595
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1336
01:51:28,538 --> 01:51:30,005
and am, indeed, required by law,

1337
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:32,335
to tell them to fuck off.

1338
01:51:32,442 --> 01:51:34,103
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1339
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:36,144
so you sit there and be quiet.

1340
01:51:39,783 --> 01:51:41,774
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1341
01:51:41,885 --> 01:51:43,011
Thank you.

1342
01:51:45,221 --> 01:51:46,950
This is my weapon.

1343
01:51:47,057 --> 01:51:49,389
No question about it, don't deny it.

1344
01:51:49,492 --> 01:51:51,858
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1345
01:51:51,961 --> 01:51:52,928
We agree?

1346
01:51:53,663 --> 01:51:55,187
It's been in the FBl's possession
ever since,

1347
01:51:55,298 --> 01:51:56,697
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1348
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,324
No. Absolutely not.

1349
01:51:58,435 --> 01:52:00,562
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

1350
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:02,831
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1351
01:52:02,939 --> 01:52:05,840
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1352
01:52:05,942 --> 01:52:08,308
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1353
01:52:09,446 --> 01:52:11,107
Definitely my gun.

1354
01:52:11,214 --> 01:52:13,682
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1355
01:52:13,783 --> 01:52:15,307
Nope. No, I don't.

1356
01:52:15,418 --> 01:52:17,943
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

1357
01:52:18,054 --> 01:52:19,487
- Trust me?
- Yep.

1358
01:52:19,589 --> 01:52:20,749
Really trust me?

1359
01:52:21,124 --> 01:52:22,091
Yeah.

1360
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:24,353
With your life?

1361
01:52:24,961 --> 01:52:26,360
- Yep.
- Good.

1362
01:52:27,931 --> 01:52:30,297
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

1363
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,233
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1364
01:52:33,336 --> 01:52:34,826
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1365
01:52:34,938 --> 01:52:36,064
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

1366
01:52:36,172 --> 01:52:37,696
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1367
01:52:44,114 --> 01:52:45,877
I could keep doing this all day,

1368
01:52:46,616 --> 01:52:48,208
with every weapon in my house.

1369
01:52:48,718 --> 01:52:51,778
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1370
01:52:51,888 --> 01:52:53,913
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1371
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:55,755
But the gun don't shoot.

1372
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,150
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1373
01:52:58,261 --> 01:53:00,024
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1374
01:53:00,130 --> 01:53:03,361
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1375
01:53:03,466 --> 01:53:05,764
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1376
01:53:05,869 --> 01:53:07,632
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1377
01:53:07,737 --> 01:53:10,297
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1378
01:53:11,608 --> 01:53:12,734
Whatever.

1379
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:14,977
Who gives a shit?

1380
01:53:16,312 --> 01:53:17,779
Nice presentation.

1381
01:53:17,881 --> 01:53:19,678
But none of it sticks to me.

1382
01:53:20,884 --> 01:53:24,081
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1383
01:53:24,187 --> 01:53:25,449
Done.

1384
01:53:25,555 --> 01:53:26,886
I'll be seeing you.

1385
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:30,187
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1386
01:53:30,293 --> 01:53:31,487
Yeah, in this country.

1387
01:53:31,594 --> 01:53:34,222
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1388
01:53:39,636 --> 01:53:45,097
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1389
01:53:45,208 --> 01:53:47,904
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1390
01:53:48,011 --> 01:53:48,978
My God.

1391
01:53:49,179 --> 01:53:50,373
Look around you.

1392
01:53:50,947 --> 01:53:53,074
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1393
01:53:53,183 --> 01:53:54,741
That's all hearsay.

1394
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:57,479
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1395
01:53:57,587 --> 01:53:59,020
And I'm free to go.

1396
01:53:59,656 --> 01:54:01,453
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1397
01:54:01,558 --> 01:54:05,494
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1398
01:54:05,595 --> 01:54:07,722
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1399
01:54:08,765 --> 01:54:10,255
these events occurred
in another country,

1400
01:54:10,366 --> 01:54:11,663
outside of our laws.

1401
01:54:11,768 --> 01:54:14,293
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1402
01:54:14,404 --> 01:54:16,429
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1403
01:54:17,307 --> 01:54:19,605
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1404
01:54:19,709 --> 01:54:22,371
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1405
01:54:22,478 --> 01:54:26,005
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1406
01:54:29,485 --> 01:54:31,112
I win.

1407
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:32,449
You lose.

1408
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:34,156
Again.

1409
01:54:36,526 --> 01:54:38,084
This is ridiculous.

1410
01:55:00,383 --> 01:55:03,944
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1411
01:55:04,654 --> 01:55:06,554
But this is the world we live in.

1412
01:55:06,656 --> 01:55:09,591
And justice does not always prevail.

1413
01:55:09,692 --> 01:55:10,659
It's not the Wild West,

1414
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:13,058
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1415
01:55:14,397 --> 01:55:17,230
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1416
01:55:21,871 --> 01:55:24,401
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1417
01:55:28,544 --> 01:55:30,341
Unshackle the sergeant.

1418
01:55:33,683 --> 01:55:35,913
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1419
01:55:36,019 --> 01:55:37,281
In the face.

1420
01:55:38,688 --> 01:55:40,918
You heard that expression,

1421
01:55:41,024 --> 01:55:43,322
'You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind'?

1422
01:55:47,297 --> 01:55:50,528
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1423
01:55:51,634 --> 01:55:55,934
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1424
01:55:56,039 --> 01:55:59,440
'This is about evidence and the truth!'

1425
01:55:59,542 --> 01:56:02,067
And then you just said to him,

1426
01:56:02,178 --> 01:56:03,475
'Fuck you!'

1427
01:56:04,547 --> 01:56:06,947
'Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G.'

1428
01:56:09,218 --> 01:56:10,515
'Fuck you!

1429
01:56:12,288 --> 01:56:14,722
'The truth is what I say it is!'

1430
01:56:21,798 --> 01:56:24,130
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1431
01:56:24,233 --> 01:56:25,996
You're going to Ecuador.

1432
01:56:29,472 --> 01:56:33,067
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1433
01:56:33,176 --> 01:56:36,737
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralize the problem, but...

1434
01:56:37,013 --> 01:56:38,708
Well, they've requested you.

1435
01:56:40,483 --> 01:56:41,848
It's solvable.

1436
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,714
They requested you...

1437
01:56:48,057 --> 01:56:49,081
Swagger.

1438
01:56:53,963 --> 01:56:55,021
Turn off the lights!

1439
01:57:02,605 --> 01:57:03,629
Get my car.

1440
01:57:03,806 --> 01:57:04,932
Get my car.

1441
01:57:24,794 --> 01:57:25,761
Do something.

1442
01:57:26,562 --> 01:57:27,790
Do something!

1443
01:57:36,105 --> 01:57:37,231
Where is he?

1444
01:57:49,919 --> 01:57:51,045
He's under the floor!

1445
01:58:21,851 --> 01:58:23,443
You don't need to kill me.

1446
01:58:24,787 --> 01:58:26,414
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1447
01:58:26,856 --> 01:58:27,823
It was them.

1448
01:58:30,626 --> 01:58:33,390
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1449
01:58:35,598 --> 01:58:37,998
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1450
01:58:40,336 --> 01:58:43,737
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

1451
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:46,673
I am a United States senator!

1452
01:58:46,876 --> 01:58:47,843
Exactly.
