141
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,090
我想他自己不甘心做牺牲品
I guess Bob Lee didn't think he was expendable.

142
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,540
他自己种地和打猎为生？
Grows and shoots his own food.

143
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,840
是的，他很少离开山里
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

144
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,080
他是一个有责任感的爱国主义者
This is a man with a history of duty and patriotism.

145
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,880
爱国主义是他始终如一的信仰 明白
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs. - Aye.

146
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,390
有些人一旦信仰破灭就会无所适从
Some people don't know what to do when their belief system collapses.

147
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,820
鲍勃・李就是那类人
Bob Lee is one of those.

148
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,200
你确定有人吗？
You sure, boy?

149
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,980
不，我不需要买任何东西
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

150
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,790
从哪来回哪去
You guys turn around and go back to wherever you came from.

151
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,060
鲍勃・李・史瓦格？
Bob Lee Swagger?

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,190
我是艾萨克・约翰逊上校
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

153
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,860
你可够难找的
You're a hard man to find.

154
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,230
难度还不够
But not hard enough.

155
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,860
我们从很远的地方来
Come a long way to see you.

156
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,170
有件事想和你谈谈
We have some business needs your attention.

157
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,830
下山时要打一档
You wanna use your low gear going down the road

158
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,030
不然刹车会失灵
or your brakes'll go.

159
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,010
过来，乖狗 小心点
- Come here. Come here, boy. - Don't do that.

160
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,510
没有我的邀请你过不去 除非打死他
Come near the porch I didn't invite you, you'd have to shoot the dog.

161
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,110
你的速度不行
That's a slow draw you got there.

162
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,650
你想找死吗？
Sure you want to do that?

163
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,580
在这谁想杀死我的狗
Shoot a dog in this county on a man's land,

164
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,020
我就把他埋到山里 就算一两个月后告诉治安官
I'd bury you in the hill, and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

165
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,250
他也能理解
He understands.

166
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,290
把你的手从枪上拿开
Take your hand off your weapon.

167
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
慢慢来
Slowly.

168
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,760
别让枪炮中士真的把你埋在山里
So the gunnery sergeant doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,730
我没带枪
I don't carry a gun.

170
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,240
知道这是什么吗？
You know what that is?

171
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,240
国会荣誉勋章 美国政府颁发的最高军事荣衔
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,370
很少人能够得到它
They don't hand those out easy.

173
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,520
是你的？
Yours?

174
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,220
是的
Yeah.

175
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,310
你父亲也得到过，对吗？
Your father had one, didn't he?

176
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,940
你怎么得到的？
What did you do?

177
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,790
全靠玩命 我救了另一个战友的性命
Something foolhardy. Kept some other boys alive.

178
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,660
给我五分钟好吗？
Will you give me five minutes?

179
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,860
让你的走狗在外面等
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

180
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,690
过来，孩子，进去
Come on, boy. Get in there.

181
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,330
我需要你制订一个刺杀总统的计划
I need you to plan a presidential assassination.

182
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,460
哪国总统？
Whose president?

183
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,590
我国总统
Ours.

184
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,610
不是真的刺杀
I didn't say 'execute'.

185
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,350
只是计划
Plan.

186
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,200
为的是阻止真的计划发生
So it can be stopped.

187
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,940
情报部门说有人计划 在两周内刺杀总统
There's gonna be an attempt on the life of the President in the next two weeks.

188
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,380
我们破译了一段匿名密码
Code was broken on an anonymous transmission.

189
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,060
出自政府内部
It was internal.

190
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,530
所以不能让政府部门参与破案
We can't go to the usual agencies.

191
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,460
敌人已经打入内部
The government itself has been penetrated.

192
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,030
这段时间，总统 要参加3项公开活动
The President has three public engagements during that time.

193
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,630
分别在巴尔的摩、费城 和华盛顿特区
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.

194
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,580
特勤局的标准警戒线…
Standard Secret Service protective cordon

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,510
通常设在八百八十码之外
is out to 880 yards.

196
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,280
但截获的情报称，这次 袭击地点会定在1英里之外
But this intercept claims that the shot will be taken from beyond a mile.

197
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,380
你去实地勘查一下 然后告诉我们你的做法
We need you to scout, tell us how you would do it,

198
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,250
我们就会阻止他
so we could stop it.

199
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,750
不过老实说，我不大相信 这样的袭击会得逞
I'm not entirely convinced that a shot like this could be made.

200
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,260
但不能掉以轻心
But let's not take the chance.

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,700
你的远距离射击能力到底怎样？
Your longer shots were never confirmed.

202
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
远距离射击通常发生在…
That's because long shots generally go places

203
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,640
你们不愿意去确认的场合
you wouldn't wanna have to go afterwards to confirm them.

204
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,340
确认只是做表面文章而已
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

205
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,440
知道远距离射击要考虑什么吗？
You know what it takes to make a shot at that range?

206
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,070
需要考虑所有相关的因素：
Everything comes into play that far.

207
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,280
湿度、温度、高度、 风向、扬尘…
Humidity, elevation, temperature, wind, spindrift.

208
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,720
子弹飞向目标需要六到十秒时间
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

209
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,910
所以必须估算提前量
so you have to shoot at where the target's going to be.

210
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,970
甚至科里奥利作用*和地球自转都得考虑 *对旋转体系中进行直线运动的质点由于惯性产生偏移的一种描述

211
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,110
Even the Coriolis effect, the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

212
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,460
总统会穿防弹衣，所以要射击头部
President'll be wearing body amour. That means a headshot,

213
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,720
还要在一英里之外
at over a mile.

214
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,090
你相信真有这么大本事的枪手吗？
You believe there's a shooter involved capable of making this shot?

215
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,430
我相信
Yes.

216
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,900
那麻烦可就大了 你们一定要找到枪手
Well, then you got a real problem. You need to find the shooter.

217
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,370
那是另一批人的任务
That's being worked on from another direction.

218
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,230
我们需要你干这事
We need you to do this.

219
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,310
我根本不喜欢现任总统
Don't really like the President much.

220
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,310
前任总统更不喜欢
Didn't like the one before that much, either.

221
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,280
但是你喜欢总统制吗？
You like the idea of the President?

222
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,110
喜欢自由的国家吗？
Living in a free country?

223
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,650
难道我们能容忍让坏人统治吗…
Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?

224
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,510
没关系，几年而已
Sure, some years we do.

225
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,620
我相信你曾站在国旗前…
I believe you stood before a flag

226
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,390
庄严宣誓过…
and solemnly swore

227
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,160
要支持和捍卫美国宪法…
that you'd support and defend the Constitution of the United States

228
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,920
抗击一切敌人
against all enemies,

229
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,660
无论来自国内外
foreign and domestic.

230
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,700
五分钟到了
I think your five minutes is up.

231
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,700
听着，孩子
Listen to me, son.

232
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,910
我不希望你下星期打开电视
I don't want you to turn on the TV next week

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,420
看到总统身亡时…
and see the President dead,

234
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,180
后悔自己没阻止这一切
and know you could've done something about it.

235
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,050
希望你好自为之
Don't do that to yourself.

236
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,640
这是新型号吗？
Is that the new one?

237
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,010
那辆车
The truck.

238
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,990
装有大马力发动机？
You got the big engine in there?

239
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,650
我看看，八升 V-8 发动机
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

240
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,450
厉害，环保署竟然 不管你的每公里油耗
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother to give you the gas mileage for it.

241
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
我能拍张照吗？
You mind if I take a picture?

242
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,460
真漂亮
This is beautiful.

243
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,700
这电话二十四小时都有人接听
Someone will be at this number night or day.

244
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,510
看到他刚才做什么了吗？ 他才不是在拍发动机
You see what he did? He didn't need a photo of the engine.

245
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,910
他醉翁之意不在酒
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass about the engine.

246
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,540
他受过反侦察训练
He's trained in counterintel.

247
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,980
他的距离足以把车牌照下来
Backed up far enough to take a picture of the plates.

248
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,580
我们就需要这种人
This is our guy.

249
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,090
他好像拒绝你了
I thought he turned you down.

250
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,620
他答应了，只是自己没有意识到
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

251
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,150
Cheytac Intervention M200 点408口径

252
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,650
CheyTac LRRS(远射程步枪系统）系列之一

253
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,150
手动旋转后拉枪机

254
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,150
该枪标配的瞄准镜是Ningtforce的NXS5.5－22倍镜

255
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,150
现时的2321码射击世界记录保持枪

256
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,560
一英里大概一千七百六十码
1,760's a mile.

257
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,030
真够远，你觉得总统会有事吗？
It's a far piece, Sam. Think the President ought to worry?

258
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,460
看来总统凶多吉少
Yeah, I think he better worry.

259
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,950
它不会有事
Yeah, he'll be fine.

260
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,080
每天喂它一次 孤独时给它念念弹道表就没事了
Just feed him once a day. Read him a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.

261
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,460
好，再见
Yep. I'm out.

262
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,700
老朋友
Come here, buddy.

263
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,630
好了
Okay.

264
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,790
我出几天门你不会寂寞吧？
Think you'll be able to tough it out without me for a couple days?

265
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,610
那好
Yeah.

266
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,050
华盛顿特区

267
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,120
马里兰州，巴尔的摩

268
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,390
宾夕法尼亚州，费城

269
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,920
这里是指挥所，你们情况如何？
This is Command Post. What's your status? Over.

270
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,860
我们完成了第六条街
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

271
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,760
收到，请随时报告情况
Roger that. We copy. Checkpoint down, over.

272
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,520
各位面前的是独立宫 美利坚合众国的发源地
Before you stands Independence Hall, the birthplace of the United States

273
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,520
是美国历史上的重要建筑之一
and one of the most important buildings in American history.

274
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,750
于一七三二年建成
Built in 1732...

275
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,990
随时留意七十二号…
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

276
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,660
是独立宣言以及美国宪法的签署地
...both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution

277
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,650
were debated and signed here.

278
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,230
三个城市中…
Out of the three cities,

279
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,280
只有一个最有可能实施暗杀
there's only one with a reasonably high chance of success.

280
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,170
巴尔的摩没有足够空间
There was no room in Baltimore.

281
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,710
街道狭窄，修正风受影响
Street isn't wide enough to correct for the windage,

282
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,580
建筑物遮挡视线
buildings are in the way.

283
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,210
去华盛顿特区等于自杀
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

284
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,380
I mean, unless you're sure your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

285
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,500
来生那70个处女* *引自哈马斯恐怖分子在招募时的话“如果你成为一位烈士，真主将会赐予你70个处女”
I mean, unless you're sure your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

286
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,570
waiting for him in the afterlife,

287
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,210
否则免谈
I'd rule that out.

288
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,450
这次袭击只能在费城
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

289
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,160
而且只能在一千八百码外进行
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

290
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,730
一共有六个可能位置
It's one of six possible locations,

291
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,760
其中一个是位于总统上方五层楼
approximately five stories above the President's location.

292
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,990
估计子弹会飞行五到六秒
Flight time of the bullet that distance is five to six seconds.

293
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,330
他们会等到总统站到讲台开始演讲
They'll have to wait till he takes the podium,

294
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
开始讲几句之后
several lines into his speech.

295
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,870
那时他处于静止状态
That way he'd be completely static, obviously at his most exposed.

296
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,910
而且会选用大口径武器
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

297
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,770
很可能使用自制子弹 选用青铜合金
Expect the bullet to be handmade, bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

298
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,180
弹道系数稍低一些
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

299
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,310
弹身更光滑
touch more slippery.

300
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,910
这就是我的做法
Least that's what I'd do.

301
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,350
那么远你能保证打死他吗？
You can kill him from that far away?

302
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,320
一英里半，子弹动能达到最大
Mile and a half, the bullet's going to strike with more energy

303
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,620
比点四四 Magnum 手枪的威力还大
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

304
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,420
不成问题
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

305
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,290
麻烦的是风向
The challenge is the wind.

306
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,660
距离太远，一丝微风都会坏事
Lightest breeze uncorrected at that distance

307
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,660
is enough to ruin the shot.

308
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,960
他必须在讲台位置和 射击位置之间设立指示物
He's gonna need indicators between the podium and the shooting position.

309
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,560
速度校正比较容易
Velocity corrections are easy,

310
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,470
但角度修正涉及到三角学问
but an angle change, that becomes a trig problem.

311
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,540
他必须一瞬间完成心算
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

312
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,610
否则想一枪命中非常困难
Without something to gauge, your shot's just too tough to make cold bore.

313
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,770
一份完美的报告，小子
Impressive recon and report, son.

314
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,910
如果下手过早，他有可能逃走
Move too soon, we lose him.

315
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,310
我们想抓活的
We want to take him alive.

316
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,940
不查出黑手，悲剧还会发生
If we don't know who hired him, it could just happen again.

317
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,520
我们有六个三人小组随时待命
We'll have six three-man teams standing by.

318
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,220
史瓦格军士？
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

319
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,460
请留步
A moment?

320
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,100
你为国家做了很大贡献
You've done your country a great service, son.

321
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,190
到时候… 不，听着…
- On the day... - Look...

322
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,360
听我说
Listen.

323
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,770
你是少数了解内情的人之一
You're one of the few people who knows what to look for.

324
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,610
我需要观察员
I could use a spotter.

325
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,410
谢谢，费城
Thank you, Philadelphia.

326
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,610
总统二十分钟内发表演说
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

327
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,340
…站在各位面前的讲台上…
...before you on this stage...

328
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,110
通知火力小组各就位
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

329
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,310
…当年爱国者们共聚 独立宫草拟了一份文件
...patriots met in Independence Hall and created a document,

330
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,190
创立了《独立宣言》
the Declaration of Independence...

331
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,420
长官
Sir?

332
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,150
…和创立了美利坚合众国
...and a country, the United States of America,

333
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,690
并改变了世界
that changed the world.

334
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,130
费城是我们的家园…
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

335
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,030
各小组注意，这里是监听站
Stand by, all teams. This is Listening Post.

336
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,900
闪光已进入 J 点
Flashlight's current location is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

337
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,150
{\an8}雷明登 700PSS/DM

338
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,500
各狙击小组报告情况
All sniper teams send update on your sitrep.

339
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,650
{\an8}PSS（Police Sharp Shooter）警用枪

340
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,150
{\an8}是雷明登公司为执法机构设计的

341
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,000
待命 我们的视线很清楚
- Stand by. - Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

342
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,150
{\an8}长年来在无数执法部门服役

343
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:36,150
{\an8}可卸弹匣的版本为700DM

344
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,370
收到
Copy that.

345
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,850
十八号哨位，一切正常
Post 18 clear, over.

346
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,580
十九号哨位，请报告情况
Post 19, please report. What's your status?

347
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,020
一切正常，没发现什么可疑情况
All clear. There's really nothing going on here.

348
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,560
埃塞俄比亚大主教…
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

349
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,150
总统先生稍后会颁发费城友谊奖章
The President will be awarding the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

350
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,930
给埃塞俄比亚大主教 德斯蒙德・穆托姆博
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo, the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

351
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,600
这位大主教一直是位有争议的人物
There's been some controversy surrounding the Archbishop

352
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,870
因他常揭露发生在他的国家的暴行
as he's been speaking out regarding the atrocities in his country.

353
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,340
他计划在此次颁奖结束后
He plans to meet with the President right after the ceremony

354
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,770
与美国总统举行会谈
to discuss these matters.

355
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,180
这是伟大的时代
These are great times.

356
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,410
是具有历史意义的时代
These are historic times.

357
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,820
也是动荡不安的时代
And these are troubled times, as well.

358
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,960
贵国的这个奖章
This medal that your country...

359
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,290
黄丝带
Yellow ribbons.

360
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,950
对，那是用来向军队表达敬意的
Yeah, people put those up to remember the troops.

361
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,290
应该放在树下吧
No, they tie those low around trees.

362
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,570
这些是风向标
These are windage flags.

363
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,230
由此判断，大概射击位置…
Roughly the location I'd have put them in

364
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,830
会在教堂塔顶上
for a shot from the steeple.

365
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,200
是的，有可能
Yeah. Maybe.

366
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,360
绝对是，他是个行家里手
No, definitely. He knows what he's doing.

367
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,410
教堂方向安排狙击小组了吗？
You guys got a team in place to take out the church?

368
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,340
如果那里有人 他们会在枪响之前采取行动
They'll move right before the shot is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

369
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,110
…那些对抗自由的势力渐渐抬头
...raises its head and confronts freedom,

370
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,550
妄图把自由扼杀在摇篮里
but slyly, subtly, chokes it off at the root.

371
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,350
我们的责任是…
And it is our responsibility

372
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,690
彻底铲除这些有害的苗头
to find these dark weeds.

373
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,460
闪光已经抵达，重复一遍 闪光已经抵达
Flashlight has arrived. I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

374
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,530
如果你刚打开电视… 你好
- If you just joined us... - Hi.

375
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,270
提蒙斯警官，本地分局的
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

376
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,870
这是鲍勃・李・史瓦格
Bob Lee Swagger.

377
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,740
认识你非常荣幸
It is a real honor to meet you.

378
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,540
你的枪套扣松开了
You're unsnapped, officer.

379
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,010
我靠…
Shit. Oh, fuck.

380
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,150
{\an8}GLOCK系列手枪

381
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,380
丢了枪可麻烦了
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

382
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,150
{\an8}奥地利格洛克公司的著名系列

383
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,980
真的非常荣幸
Again, it's an honor.

384
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,650
{\an8}自80年代推出的G17以来

385
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,960
…我们为大国服务的…
...of our stewardship of this great...

386
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,150
{\an8}已经装备了40多个国家的军警

387
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,590
那个黑人是谁？ 他是埃塞俄比亚大主教
- That our guy in the collar? - The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

388
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,970
来接受奖章，你知道的？
He's getting a medal. Know it?

389
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,080
非洲之角*，我知道 *指索马里半岛，非洲东北部呈犀牛角状的地区，地理位置重要，冲突不断
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

390
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,240
我在那工作过
You know I worked there?

391
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,140
“枪杀平民时你的 第一感觉是什么？”
You know what they say about the first thing that you feel

392
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,180
知道他们怎么说吗？
when you shoot a civilian, right?

393
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,580
“枪的后坐力”？ 没错
- Recoil of your rifle? - Right.

394
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,150
真有创意
That's very original.

395
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,520
谢谢大主教分享 如此有启发性的演讲
Thank you, Archbishop, for those inspiring words.

396
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,110
下面是总统讲话了
The President speaks next.

397
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,490
各小组准备行动
All teams stand by.

398
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,920
吉布森特工 报告收到，一切正常
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by. Situation all clear, over.

399
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,690
詹姆斯特工，一切正常
Agent James, all clear.

400
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,820
现在我感到很荣幸…
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

401
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,870
风速每小时三英里 …向大家介绍接下来的嘉宾
- Got wind at three, full value. - ... to introduce to you

402
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,940
有请美国总统
the President of the United States.

403
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,130
风向正中，修正角四点五度
Make it four-and-a-half minutes of angle.

404
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,100
静风修正三密耳
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

405
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,360
刺客上膛了
He's loaded.

406
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,400
正在计算高度、湿度还有温度
Altitude, humidity, temperature accounted for.

407
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,110
…本市曾是国都…
In the city that was the capital of...

408
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,680
我们要赶快解决他
We got to take him.

409
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,240
还有十秒
Ten seconds.

410
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,010
风向正好对他有利 马上动手吧

scouting shooting locations, traveling and taking wind readings.

542
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,020
尽管警方在全国范围内加紧搜捕 但仍未发现史瓦格的踪影
As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.

543
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,810
对不起
Excuse me.

544
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,010
刚刚停电了，不能营业了
Can't sell you nothing. Just lost our power.

545
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,350
我付现金，不用找零钱
Please. I got cash, and you can keep the change.

546
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,190
可我没办法找东西
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

547
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,760
我只需要注射针头、盐、 糖
Please, all I need is a marinade needle, some salt, some sugar,

548
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,330
还有一些水
couple bottles of water.

549
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,250
要多少？
How many?

550
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,340
先生对不起，我感到很遗憾
Well, sir, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that.

551
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,940
我敢肯定她是个非常虔诚的基督徒
I'm sure she's a really nice Christian woman

552
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,880
但我们不处理此类事务
but we don't take care of those things here.

553
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,050
好吧… FBI 公布了一个录像
- Yeah. Okay, well... - The FBl released a video letter...

554
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,180
去咨询专家吧 …威胁要取总统性命
- ... see a counselor. - ... threatening the life of the President...

555
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,970
可以联系《菲尔博士》*或类似的，好的 *美国著名脱口秀节目

556
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,310
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

557
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,690
是十天前鲍勃・李・史瓦格寄出的
...signed and dated by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

558
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,690
联邦特工搜查了怀俄明风河地区
Federal agents today executed a search warrant

559
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,690
in the Wind River range of Wyoming

560
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,700
史瓦格在那里居住过数年时间
where Swagger had been living for several years.

561
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,200
同时，FBI 一直不愿对…
In the meantime, the FBl has been unwilling to comment,

562
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,640
史瓦格下落不明的事情发表评论
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

563
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,940
有线索了吗？ 没
- Get anything? - No.

564
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,400
好的，在什么地方？
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

565
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,950
还有呢？
And? Yes?

566
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,220
她怀疑就是他，不过 当时停电周围很黑
She thinks it was him, but it was dark because the power was out in the store.

567
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,660
他买了什么？ 最好没错
- What'd he buy? - Gotta be.

568
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,750
盐、糖、水和注射针头
Salt, sugar, water, and a marinade injector.

569
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,230
这家伙想吃烧烤？
Guy going to a barbecue.

570
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,930
盐水注射针头可以用来打点滴
Salt, water, an injector could be used for an IV,

571
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,090
可糖用来干什么？
but what's with the sugar?

572
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,460
等一下！
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold that! Hold that!

573
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,160
糖在战场上一直用来处理伤口
Well, sugar's been used to treat battlefield wounds

574
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,240
已经有几百年历史
for hundreds of years.

575
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,570
当然必须依靠渗透压力才行
It has something to do with osmotic pressure.

576
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,110
这在拿破仑战争中司空见惯
It was popular during the Napoleonic War.

577
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,680
你在报告中提到拿破仑战争
You go into Howard's office with the Napoleonic War,

578
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,970
霍华德局长会送你去精神病院
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

579
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,310
回去办公，别让自己毁了
Go back to your desk. I'm saving your life.

580
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,240
其中一点…
One thing is...

581
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,210
…一七九零年到一八零零年…
...1790 to 1800.

582
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,520
其中一点…
One thing is...

583
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,150
（温布尔登杯赢家）

584
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,600
肯塔基州，基尼市

585
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,120
打扰了，夫人
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

586
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,660
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

587
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,630
你是鲍勃・李・史瓦格 唐尼以前的拍档
You're Bob Lee. Swagger. Donnie's old partner.

588
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,360
我没枪杀总统
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

589
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,560
我知道
I know.

590
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,660
你知道？
You do?

591
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,300
死的不是总统 是埃塞俄比亚大主教
The President's not dead. Ethiopian Archbishop is.

592
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,900
谁会想杀他啊？
Why in the hell would somebody want to shoot him?

593
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,770
你是护士吧？
Look, you're a nurse, right?

594
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,480
不，那只是唐尼的愿望 我晕血
No. No, that was Donnie's dream. I couldn't stand the blood.

595
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,780
我是小学教师
I teach the third grade.

596
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,080
帮帮我 你应该离开
- Please. - Look, you should go.

597
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,550
帮帮我
Please.

598
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,540
Please?

599
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,880
我是被陷害的
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

600
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,460
我发誓
I swear.

601
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,190
我遇到麻烦了，需要帮助
I'm in some bad trouble and I need some help.

602
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,820
我不会跑那么远来对你撒谎的
I wouldn't have come all the way here to lie to you.

603
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,000
你打算朝我开枪？
You still figuring on shooting me?

604
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,910
那霰弹枪太长了，不方便
Only that shotgun's a little long to bring up fast.

605
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,140
如果要下手就快点
Look, if you're going to do it, just get it over with.

606
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,210
我走投无路了
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

607
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:20,180
把车停到车库，邻居很快会起床
Pull the truck in the garage. The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

608
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,810
叫我莎拉
You'd best call me Sarah.

609
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,120
好的
All right.

610
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,600
警察局，请问有什么事？
911, what's your emergency?

611
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,330
你好？
Hello?

612
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,270
这里是警察局 我们刚才接到你的电话
This is 911. We received a hang-up from this location.

613
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,900
邻居的狗碰倒了垃圾桶
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over the trash cans

614
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,500
吓了我一跳 现在没事了，谢谢了
and scared the hell out of me. Everything's fine. Thanks.

615
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,580
那就好
Okay, then.

616
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,850
如果打电话报警不说话
Seems you call the police and hang up without saying anything,

617
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,020
他们会很负责的打过来询问
they call you back right away.

618
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,630
我早就应该来看你
I should've come and seen you in person.

619
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,040
应该在出事之前
Before. I mean, then.

620
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,500
我收到你的信了
Yeah, I read the letter.

621
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,870
没关系
It was okay.

622
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,140
还有你每年寄来的花
And once a year I got the flowers.

623
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,170
你看来很糟
You don't look real good.

624
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,490
我这回是大难不死，我撑了一晚
I'm supposed to be dead. Been a long night.

625
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,560
怎么逃出来的？
Why aren't you?

626
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,030
美国政府花了大量时间金钱
Well, the U.S. government spent a lot of time and money

627
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,930
教会我如何死里逃生
teaching me how not to die

628
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,520
当然也教会我如何杀人
after they got done teaching me how to kill people.

629
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,230
你想让我帮你什么？
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

630
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,700
你会用十字绣针法 帮我把伤口缝一下吗？
You can do a running cross-stitch, finish it with an embroidery knot?

631
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,780
会
Yeah.

632
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,710
最好去不同商店买
You got to try to spread it out.

633
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,190
集中购买容易引起怀疑
It's gonna look odd you buy it all in one place.

634
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:41,130
一幅外科手套、两瓶酒精、两尺长的导管 一包厨房海绵、热水瓶、两把手术剪刀…

635
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,130
这三年怎么感觉像十年一样漫长？

636
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,410
How can it be three years ago when it seems like ten?

637
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,670
因为我们很痛苦

638
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,950
Mileage can be rough.

639
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,810
竟然还有比我早的

640
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,100
No one ever beats me in.

641
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,460
你没回家？

642
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,740
You never left.

643
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,490
局里的人都认为我疯了

644
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,770
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

645
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,730
好像我看见的听见的都是假的

646
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,010
Like I didn't see what I saw, or heard what I heard.

647
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,270
我没疯，你觉得呢？

648
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,550
I'm not crazy, though. You think I'm crazy?

649
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,770
这些情报从哪得到的？

650
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,050
Where did all this stuff come from?

651
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,270
一开始我以为是来自华盛顿附近的匡提科* *FBI学院，也是海军陆战队训练基地之一

652
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,850
At first I thought it was Washington, Quantico.

653
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,580
结果不是这么回事 像变魔术一样送来了

654
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,860
I checked and it didn't. It just magically arrived.

655
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,090
他们来自一些协助机构，如烟酒枪支管理局 国家侦察局还有不知名的部门

656
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:40,370
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO, places that don't even have initials

657
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,990
他们在出现紧急状况时提供合作

658
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,270
they cooperate in times of national emergency.

659
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,720
你需要休息一下了

660
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,000
You need to get some sleep.

661
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,590
要知道枪击发生后二十二分钟

662
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,870
You know that the first ballistics diagram got here

663
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,530
这里就获得了第一张弹道图

664
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,810
22 minutes after the shooting.

665
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,650
我们工作效率高

666
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,940
We're good at our jobs.

667
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,230
十二分钟时，警方派出了直升机

668
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,520
12 minutes after the shooting, they were still scrambling choppers.

669
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,460
并且封锁了现场

670
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,740
The scene was locked down.

671
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,070
他们是怎么在随后的 十分钟内完成检测的？

672
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,350
How did they get a reverse azimuth 10 minutes after that?

673
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,270
我们是吃官饭的

674
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,550
I mean, we work for the federal government.

675
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,710
不会有那么高效率

676
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,990
We're not that good at our jobs.

677
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,170
想看东西不？ 可能不想

678
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,450
- You want to see something? - Probably not.

679
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,640
这是我下载的

680
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,930
I downloaded this.

681
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,870
这是史瓦格两年前

682
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,160
This is a full-scale printout

683
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,970
在九百码射击目标的全尺寸图

684
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,260
of a target Swagger shot two years ago at 1,000 yards.

685
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,350
我在上面打了孔，那是一次比赛

686
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:13,630
I punched in the holes myself. It was at a competition.

687
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:18,190
我读过一篇文章说史瓦格 有百步穿杨的硬功夫

688
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,470
I read an article. It said Swagger shot a silver dollar at a grand.

689
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,490
五发子弹

690
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,770
Five shots,

691
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,060
在一千码距离

692
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,340
at 1,000 yards,

693
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,560
落点范围只有一英寸半 一英寸半！

694
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,840
an inch-and-a-half spread. An inch and a half!

695
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,420
…这城市曾经是国都…

696
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,710
It was the capital of the United States...

697
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,060
那是总统身后的旗子 几乎纹丝不动

698
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,350
That's the flag behind the President. It's barely waving.

699
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,600
这是国家气象局给出的

700
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:32,890
This is the wind speed and direction

701
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,970
事发时的风速和风向数据

702
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,250
according to the National Weather Service

703
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,370
我测算了一下

704
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,660
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

705
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,110
枪法那么精准的人…

706
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,390
Now, how does a man who can do that

707
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,180
在两千码距离射击竟然偏2.5英尺

708
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,460
miss by two-and-a-half feet at 2,000 yards?

709
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,980
我不明白

710
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,260
I don't get it.

711
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,920
你熬了一整夜 别管它了，去睡吧

712
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:48,200
You've had a long night. Let it go and get some sleep.

713
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,150
我看了提蒙斯的采访

714
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,430
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

715
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,490
他说当时在步行巡逻

716
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,770
He said he was walking foot patrol,

717
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,190
看到有步枪从窗口伸了出来

718
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,470
saw a rifle barrel sticking out of a window,

719
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,130
于是上去检查，他向史瓦格开枪

720
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,410
went upstairs to investigate, and shot Swagger.

721
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,130
狙击手是绝不会把枪伸出窗外的

722
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,420
No sniper sticks his rifle out of a window.

723
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,000
他们会在隐蔽处射击

724
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,280
They shoot from cover, back in the room.

725
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,300
这完全不合逻辑

726
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,590
It doesn't make any sense.

727
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,200
我要去找提蒙斯谈谈 你不能谈

728
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,490
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons. - No, you're not.

729
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,400
为什么？他们真开除我？

730
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,690
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me if I do?

731
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,010
提蒙斯昨晚在巷子里 被抢劫犯杀死了

732
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,290
Timmons was killed by a mugger in an alley last night.

733
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,180
搞阴谋总离不开杀人灭口

734
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,460
In a conspiracy, all loose ends are trimmed.

735
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,460
就像杰克・路比打死了奥斯华德*？ *刺杀肯尼迪的凶手被灭口

736
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,970
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

737
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,780
好人不一定有好报

738
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,070
Bad things happen to good people.

739
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:26,920
可这也太快了

740
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,200
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

741
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,370
我暂时把血止住了

742
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,650
Well, I stopped the bleeding temporarily.

743
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,530
不过恐怕还会再流

744
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,820
But it'll cut loose again.

745
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,940
我只能延缓感染的发生 你必须帮我…

746
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,220
I held off the worst of the infection, but you're gonna have to open it up,

747
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,840
把创伤清理干净

748
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,120
cut out and scrub away anything that's dead,

749
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,810
然后把伤口再缝上

750
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,100
working your way out, sewing it together

751
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,710
千万注意不能发生二次感染

752
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,000
and you got to try to make sure you don't re-infect it.

753
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,590
准备好了吗？

754
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,870
You ready for this?

755
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,620
我吸了一氧化氮后就会昏过去

756
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,900
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s and pass out.

757
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,130
祝你成功

758
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,410
Good luck, okay?

759
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,510
我需要你制订一个刺杀总统的计划

760
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,790
I need you to plan a presidential assassination.

761
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,040
那个黑人是谁？

762
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,320
That our guy in the collar?

763
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,370
哪国总统？

764
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,650
Whose president?

765
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,880
我没有叫你执行

766
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,160
I didn't say 'execute'.

767
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,880
来接受奖章，你知道的？

768
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,160
He's getting a medal. Know it?

769
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,210
埃塞俄比亚大主教

770
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,500
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

771
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,110
你必须找到那枪手

772
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,400
You need to find the shooter.

773
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,430
不

774
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,710
No.

775
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,400
两天半时间身中两枪 竟然找不到？

776
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,690
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice, no sign?

777
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,910
必须找到他

778
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:39,190
Find me something.

779
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,170
也许他钻进某个地洞里死了

780
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,460
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

781
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,040
他没死

782
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,330
He's not dead.

783
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,290
对他进行全面调查

784
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,570
Tear apart his life.

785
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,720
再查

786
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,000
Again.

787
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:54,990
成功了？

788
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,270
Go okay?

789
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,700
我一直在做梦

790
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,980
I've been hallucinating.

791
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,640
我得告诉你一件事

792
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,920
Something I need to tell you.

793
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,710
来福死了

794
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,990
Ralphie's dead.

795
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,040
谁是来福？

796
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,320
Who's Ralphie?

797
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,610
他们说你把狗杀了

798
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:15,900
Well, they said you shot your dog

799
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,620
因为知道自己有去无回

800
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,900
'cause you knew you weren't coming back.

801
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,190
他们说的？

802
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,470
They said that, huh?

803
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,020
它叫山姆

804
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,310
Name was Sam.

805
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,590
是条好狗，我把它从小养大的

806
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,880
He was a good dog. I raised him from a pup.

807
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,860
你还好吗？

808
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,140
You okay?

809
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,800
不

810
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,090
No.

811
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,670
你有什么打算？

812
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,950
What are you gonna do?

813
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,800
我要先养好伤

814
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,090
I'll get better.

815
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,170
然后查清事情真相

816
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,450
Then I'm going to burn their playhouse down.

817
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:57,920
哪种武器系统要求脚架的尺寸是43*43*29英寸？

818
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,010
简单，M3可支撑多种枪械，最多到50口径重机枪

819
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,400
这种系统为什么要接上100米长1/4英寸宽的电缆？

820
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,140
有何贵干？

821
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,430
Can I help you?

822
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,860
看看这个网站：www.precisionremotes.com

823
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,950
陷阱式T-250D战术遥控系统

824
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,270
别动

825
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,560
Hold still.

826
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,760
我一直想问你

827
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,040
I been meaning to ask you.

828
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,160
你有男朋友吗？

829
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,440
You have a boyfriend?

830
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,220
怎么？

831
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,510
Why?

832
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,030
难道要我一辈子守寡？

833
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,310
Am I still supposed to be the grieving widow?

834
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,800
唐尼去世三年了

835
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,080
It's been three years.

836
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,870
不

837
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,160
No.

838
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,870
我只想知道，如果有人擅自闯入…

839
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,160
Just wonder if I'm gonna have to shoot somebody

840
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,180
我是否应该朝他开枪

841
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,420
walks through that door without knocking,

842
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,460
wondering where you've been.

843
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,040
没有

844
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,320
Well, no.

845
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,380
目前没有稳定的男朋友

846
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,660
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

847
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,300
还不错嘛

848
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,460
Not bad.

849
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,240
只是伤口有点僵硬

850
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,390
A little stiff, but...

851
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,010
嘿

852
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,170
Hey.

853
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,940
你可以当一名好护士

854
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,100
You know, you would've made one hell of a nurse.

855
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,050
你表现得非常勇敢

856
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,200
That was really brave, what you did.

857
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,580
你救了我

858
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,730
You saved my life.

859
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,290
我好点了，我该走了

860
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,440
I'm better. I better get to it.

861
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,730
他们绝不会停止寻找你的

862
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,880
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

863
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,930
相信我

864
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,080
Never.

865
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,370
他们绝不会放过你

866
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,520
They're never gonna stop looking.

867
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,510
除了找我他们还会找另外一个人

868
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,660
In the meantime, they need someone else to find.

869
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,100
我会把他送入虎口

870
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,250
I'm going to give them him.

871
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,680
你说什么？

872
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,830
Excuse me?

873
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,940
很可能收到一石二鸟的效果

874
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,090
May be a way to get two birds with that stone, too.

875
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,330
史瓦格？ 嘿

876
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,480
- Swagger? - Hey.

877
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,870
这是唐尼小时候的猎枪

878
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,020
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with when he was a kid.

879
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,050
看着不起眼，但非常准

880
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,200
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

881
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,580
我藏起它之前擦过和上过油

882
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,730
I cleaned and oiled it before I put it away.

883
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,740
给我？

884
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,890
You sure?

885
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,950
是的

886
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,100
Yeah.

887
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,660
当初他们来找你时…

888
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,810
Why'd you go?

889
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,190
为何答应他们？

890
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,340
When they came to see you.

891
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,760
他们知道我的弱点

892
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,910
They know which buttons to press.

893
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,660
我过于轻信别人 只要你说出你是爱国者

894
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,810
I'm still enough of a sucker, you press that patriot button,

895
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:32,360
我就会说“要我干什么都行”

896
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,510
I'll sit up in my chair and say, 'Which way you want me to go, boss?'

897
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:36,100
我不认为这值得骄傲 但也不觉得羞耻

898
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,250
I mean, I ain't real proud of it, but I ain't ashamed, either.

899
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,840
我有个计划

900
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:38,990
You know, I got a plan,

901
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,540
可能需要你的帮助

902
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,690
but I think I'm going to need your help.

903
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,650
好的，我会帮你

904
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,800
Okay. I'll do it.

905
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,680
可我还没说要干什么

906
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,830
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

907
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,380
我知道

908
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,530
I know.

909
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,360
听着

910
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,510
Look.

911
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,670
都怪我不好

912
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,820
It was my fault.

913
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,440
什么？

914
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,590
What?

915
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,170
如果不是我 唐尼一定不会死

916
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,320
You know, with Donnie. I should never have...

917
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,240
什么？

918
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,390
What?

919
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,050
你怎么敢这么说？

920
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,200
Don't you dare.

921
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:30,150
你不能把责任都揽到自己身上

922
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,300
Don't you try and take that away from him.

923
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,930
他知道为什么参军

924
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:35,080
He knew exactly what he was doing when he enlisted.

925
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,000
参加侦察兵狙击手训练的时候 也知道自己在做什么

926
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,280
He knew exactly what he was doing

927
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:39,150
when he enrolled in scout sniper training.

928
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,680
他热爱自己的职业

929
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:42,820
He loved what he did.

930
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,740
没人强迫他

931
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,890
No one made him do it.

932
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,310
你不必感到内疚

933
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,460
That ain't yours to carry.

934
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,850
好吧

935
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,000
You're right.

936
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,890
对不起，是我不好

937
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,040
I'm sorry I tried.

938
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,270
没事的
It's okay.

939
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,550
我需要你找一个 FBI 探员
I need you to meet with this FBl agent.

940
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,420
利用他把约翰逊引出来
Use him to flush Johnson out of his hiding place.

941
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,520
你只要告诉他车辆识别码 他就会按课本上教他的去做
Give him the vehicle ID number. He'll do what he's trained to do.

942
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,100
然后你就马上离开 别被他们抓住
You get in and get out. Don't get caught.

943
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,990
抓住了你就等于抓住了我
You get caught, I get caught.

944
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,660
知道这是什么吗？
You know what that is?

945
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,170
他说没开枪杀人，可我怎么知道？
Says he didn't shoot no one, but I don't know.

946
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,570
他和我在一起
Well, he's been staying with me.

947
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,730
谁和你在一起？ 鲍勃・李・史瓦格？
Who's been staying with you? Bob Lee Swagger?

948
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:06,440
车子的牌照或许是假的 但这号码肯定是真的
The plates are probably fake. Pretty sure the other number's real.

949
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,150
这是什么？ 车辆识别码
- And what is this? - A VIN number.

950
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,490
谁也不会闲着没事去改它
Seems no one goes through the trouble to change them anymore.

951
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,630
你要老老实实坐在这 等我走远了再离开
And you're going to sit real still until I'm long gone.

952
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,460
看到那个穿飞鹰夹克的人了吗？
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

953
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,060
对不起，先生，请你出示你的身份证
Excuse me, sir. Can I see some ID, please?

954
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,630
先生，请摘下你的帽子
Sir, I'm going to need you to take off your hat

955
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:26,890
出示你的身份证
and show me some ID.

956
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,600
请你按照我的要求做
I'm not gonna ask you again.

957
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,770
摘下帽子，混蛋
Take your hat off, asshole!

958
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,820
{\an8}伯莱塔M92FS
Get on the ground! Get your ass on the ground!

959
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,720
趴在地上！趴在地上！

960
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:55,820
{\an8}属于意大利伯莱塔公司70年代末的M9系列

961
01:04:55,820 --> 01:05:00,820
{\an8}美国陆军大量采购，但评价不高

962
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,280
嘿，近来还好吗
Hey, how's it going?

963
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,290
嘿，约翰
Hey, John.

964
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:28,940
未经许可，禁止入内

965
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,930
共有1个文档符合此号码

966
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,010
喂，艾德
- Hey, Ed? - Yeah.

967
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,050
你拿了斯蒂芬的文件吗？ 我要拿回来
You got that Stevens file we wanted back?

968
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,290
被隔离信息，需要D 级别*通行证 *美国国防部最高警戒级别

969
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,690
你真的这么想知道？ 可能会被开除的
How badly do you want to know? Because this will get you fired.

970
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:03,730
再过四十五分钟…
Well, I have to go before the Office of Professional Responsibility

971
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:05,820
我就要去风纪调查处接受审查了
in 45 minutes for a review.

972
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,960
反正我都会被开除的 我豁出去了
I'm gonna get fired anyway. I'm done worrying about that.

973
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:12,140
你认为呢？
What do you think?

974
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,280
我认为 CNN 在我们之前 搞到了录像带
I think that CNN got the tapes before we did,

975
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,710
通过剪辑来展现射击角度
already edited together to show the angles.

976
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,910
谁交给他们的？
Who delivered them?

977
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:22,420
是一个始终保持沉默的 秘密机构干的
An unnamed agency who will never confirm or deny.

978
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,490
这一次他们否认，实际上…
They denied, which is a...

979
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:30,250
就等于他们已经承认了
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

980
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,190
承认什么？
Of what?

981
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:35,820
你的问题已经超过了 自己应该知道的范围了
That you are asking questions way outside your pay grade.

982
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,060
别这样，快告诉我
Oh, come on, just tell me.

983
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,660
你不会想接受他们的调查的
You don't want to be here for that review.

984
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,330
他们不仅可以开除你 还可以起诉你、拘留你
They don't have to stop at firing you. They can charge you and hold you.

985
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,910
主管特别助理有 D 级通行证
The ASAC's job comes with Delta clearance.

986
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,250
谢谢 快走
- Thank you. - Go.

987
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,420
这是一个网络的聊天记录
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

988
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,620
他们无所不谈 开始我并没有太在意
These guys talk about everything. I didn't give it much thought at the time.

989
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,200
我们利用 WiFi 网络 跟踪到一家甜品店
We just traced it to a donut shop with free WiFi.

990
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:19,970
这是七分钟之前费城 FBI 分局 提出的 D 级通行证申请
But this, this is a Delta-level clearance request

991
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:19,890
out of the FBl field office in Philadelphia seven minutes ago.

992
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,670
谷歌地图显示那家甜品店…
Funny thing, Google Maps puts the donut shop

993
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,300
就在费城分局的三个街区外
only three blocks away from the field office.

994
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,470
史瓦格消失以前只有一个人见过他
There's only one guy who met with Swagger before he disappeared.

995
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,780
他住在费城
He lives in Philly.

996
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,450
为 FBI 工作
And he works for the FBl.

997
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,090
尼古拉斯・孟菲斯
Nicholas Memphis.

998
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,980
那是一家很奇怪的公司 跟许多大企业有生意往来
...really strange company. Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

999
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,930
在弗吉尼亚和特拉华有分支机构 注册地在巴拿马
Offices in Virginia, Delaware, registered in Panama.

1000
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,830
他们有条船悬挂利比亚国旗
They own a boat that's flagged out of Libya.

1001
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:43,920
他们绝对不是政府机构
They're definitely not government,

1002
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,760
但有军方背景
but they have high ex-military contacts like you wouldn't believe.

1003
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,060
他们是承包商
These are contractors.

1004
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:50,660
我也不能告诉你 这公司是做什么的，但…
I can't tell what this company does, but...

1005
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:53,530
嘿
Hey.

1006
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,610
嘿，嘿，嘿！
Hey, hey, hey!

1007
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,780
孟菲斯？
Memphis?

1008
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,850
孟菲斯！
Memphis!

1009
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,960
这家伙什么也不知道
For a man who didn't know much,

1010
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:14,360
没必要再折腾下去了
you sure took a long, painful time to tell it.

1011
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,060
给他灌点水
Get him some water.

1012
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,270
好
Good.

1013
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,050
想撒尿了没？
Got to pee yet?

1014
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,020
把胃里的药物排泄干净
Got to flush them drugs out of your system.

1015
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,420
免得你自杀后引起怀疑
Look awful suspicious if you were to go and shoot yourself

1016
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,790
我们这里吃的都是一种药
pumped full of the same shit the agency uses.

1017
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,830
我不会自杀的！
I'm not going to shoot myself.

1018
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,760
你会的
Sure you will.

1019
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,230
带他过去，准备好
Take him out. Get him ready.

1020
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,300
不！
No!

1021
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,170
那是我的枪
That's my gun.

1022
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,300
是的
Yeah.

1023
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,280
你还写了份感人的遗书
You wrote a real touching suicide note, too.

1024
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,710
写满了你对错误的悔恨
All overwrought with guilt about your mistakes.

1025
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,310
挣扎也没用
Quit your struggling.

1026
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:21,730
这办法很有效 我们不是第一次用了
This thing works. It's not the first time we've used it.

1027
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,930
罗素！罗素！
Russo. Russo!

1028
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,660
戴维斯快来！
Davis, get out here!

1029
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,640
我说你们还在磨蹭什么？
What is the goddamn hold-up?

1030
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:17,450
请不要杀我！ 请不要杀我！我相信你！
Don't kill me, please! Don't kill me! I believe you!

1031
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,640
杀你？
Kill you?

1032
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,380
要杀我早杀了
Had enough chances. I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

1033
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,420
哪个混蛋发明了这玩意？
What kind of asshole'd think up a thing like this?

1034
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,900
这个小口径步枪和 简易消声器还挺好用嘛
Not bad with a poodle shooter and a makeshift silencer, huh?

1035
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,330
帮我把他们扔到水里
Help me toss these boys in the water?

1036
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,740
原来是你设的圈套！
You set me up and you used me as bait!

1037
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,680
是的，但他们真的就照做了
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

1038
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,810
我本来想留个活口
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

1039
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,010
但他们真的想杀你
but they were kind of determined to kill you.

1040
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,350
你可以请个好律师 我给局里打电话
You can hire a good lawyer, and I'll call the Bureau.

1041
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,390
可以和他们协商
They can work out some kind of deal.

1042
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,220
你可以向他们证明主教不是你杀的
This is explainable. You can prove that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

1043
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:58,450
看来你还是不明白
I don't think you understand.

1044
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,750
那些人杀了我的狗
These boys killed my dog.

1045
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,600
现在是二十一世纪 你不可以跟他们这样硬拼
Hey, this is the 21st century. You can't go to war with these people.

1046
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,260
最终还是要法律…
In the end, the law is all...

1047
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,070
法律绝对不会把他们怎么样
In the end, the law'll never catch and hold them.

1048
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,470
不出一两年，他们就会重操旧业
In a year or two, they'll be back in business.

1049
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:14,100
改头换面，继续做恶 重振旗鼓
New names, new messenger boys, same old story.

1050
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,500
只有我会死
And I'll be dead.

1051
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,540
所以我还要想出一条活路
It's gonna be some hard, hairy work, Pork.

1052
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,740
血还要流，人还会死
There's gonna be more shooting, and more people are gonna die.

1053
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:23,080
我别无选择，只能把这件事做到底
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell I mean to see it through.

1054
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,680
只说你是合作还是不合作？
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

1055
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,320
我今天没赶上一个会议
You know, I missed a meeting today

1056
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,880
在那个会议上我会被开除
where I was going to get fired for unprofessional conduct

1057
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,990
因为遭到了这群不存在的人的绑架
because I was kidnapped by people that don't exist.

1058
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,040
我抬他的腿
I'll take his legs.

1059
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,800
这就对了，菜鸟
It's a good call, Pork.

1060
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:48,170
你想说一个 FBI 菜鸟特工
You're trying to tell me a rookie FBl agent

1061
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,070
杀了他们三个？
overpowered and killed the three of them?

1062
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,150
不
No.

1063
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,780
他们是被人从两百码外开枪打死的
They were shot from a distance of about 200 yards.

1064
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,910
用点二二口径的步枪
With a.22.

1065
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,120
史瓦格还活着 是的
- Swagger's alive. - Yes.

1066
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:06,480
那个年轻的 FBI 特工
And that young kid,

1067
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,400
FBl Agent

1068
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,160
尼克・孟菲斯
Nick Memphis,

1069
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:14,070
他已经设法窃取了 D 级通行证
who managed to pry out a Delta-level clearance,

1070
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,900
他没有返回局里 目前还和史瓦格呆在一起
hasn't come back to the office and is out there with him.

1071
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,040
怎么样？
What?

1072
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,300
我刚查了史瓦格的信用卡
I just went over Swagger's financials again.

1073
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,440
他每年定期给一个人寄鲜花
Once a year, he sent flowers to someone with his Visa card.

1074
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,880
我侵入了FTD*的数据库，找到了地址 *世界最悠久、最大的鲜花快递公司
I cracked the FTD database, got an address.

1075
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:33,320
是在唐尼・佛恩的祭日 寄给他的遗孀
Donnie Fenn's widow. Anniversary of his death.

1076
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,620
这个女人又改用了以前的姓
She went back to using her maiden name,

1077
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,950
所以当初调查的时候给漏掉了
which is why we missed it the first time.

1078
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,890
估计她是世界上唯一一个
She's maybe the only person in the entire world

1079
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,050
对史瓦格言听计从的人了
that would believe anything that Swagger had to say.

1080
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,570
你看，肯塔基州基尼市
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

1081
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,330
开车一会就到
It's just within driving range.

1082
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,000
开车太慢了，我们坐飞机去 好
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet. - All right.

1083
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,480
这是和史瓦格的战争
We've given Swagger a new war,

1084
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,380
他又有了观察员
he's found a new spotter.

1085
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,380
事情变得非常难办了
This is about to get worse.

1086
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,070
田纳西州，雅典市

1087
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,110
好像到了
I think we're here.

1088
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,480
史瓦格
Hey. Swagger.

1089
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,320
我们到了
I think we're here.

1090
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,560
欢迎回到田纳西
Welcome to Tennessee.

1091
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,790
这里可是枪战之乡
Patron state of shooting stuff.

1092
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,500
那个人是谁？
Hey, who is this guy?

1093
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,130
他是密西西比的传奇人物
This guy was the greatest gunsmith east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

1094
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,220
He knows more about guns and the people who shoot them

1095
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,640
比史密斯威森枪厂*知道得还多 *美国最大的手枪制造商

1096
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,390
than Smith % Wesson.

1097
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,070
不过别担心 他要杀我们三英里外就动手了
Don't really matter anymore. He knew we were coming the last three miles.

1098
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,340
注意礼貌 好的
- You mind your manners. - All right.

1099
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:10,040
两位远道而来，想找什么？
You boys come a long way. What you looking for?

1100
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,440
智慧
Wisdom.

1101
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,120
你们可能找错了地方
You come to the wrong place.

1102
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,490
可能吧
Maybe.

1103
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,180
如果有人想让一支步枪射出的子弹
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet from one rifle

1104
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,950
和另外一支步枪的子弹完全相同
and have it match exactly to another.

1105
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,430
能做到吗？
Could that be done?

1106
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,550
坐
Take a seat.

1107
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,660
请坐，先生
Have a chair, son.

1108
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,900
如果你能使步枪的 子弹射出没有留下痕迹
If you could get a bullet that had been shot clean through the first rifle,

1109
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,500
就可以在上面伪造槽纹
could make the grooves match.

1110
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,940
很久都没人这么做了
Kind of thing ain't been done in a long time, though.

1111
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,570
从大主教身上取下的子弹
The bullet that was taken out of the Archbishop

1112
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,240
已经严重变形
was completely mangled on impact.

1113
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,580
FBI 只能做材质鉴别
FBl match was metallurgical.

1114
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,840
谢谢，老太婆
Thank you, Mother.

1115
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:46,350
但是那也不能保证万无一失 所以他们必须格外慎重
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that going in, so they had to be sure.

1116
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,950
很难想象他们能够做到
And I still can't figure out how they could be.

1117
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,450
味道不错？ 是啊
- Good coffee? - Yep.

1118
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:58,630
在左边的书架上找找看 上数第二层
Look on your left, there. Second shelf down.

1119
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,730
红色封皮的那本
Red leather spine.

1120
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,800
作者的名字叫史高飞
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

1121
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,880
我把它放在那里十五年了 没想到还用得上
Put it there 15 years ago. Don't figure it's moved since then.

1122
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,480
第四章 改变子弹以达到不同效果　第一节 裹纸法

1123
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,790
这里，裹纸法
Yeah. Paper patching.

1124
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,060
始于一八七零年非洲的最新技术
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

1125
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,400
用纸包裹子弹
Paper-wrapped bullet.

1126
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,030
弹头不会和枪管直接接触
No metal on metal going down the barrel.

1127
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,170
槽纹就能匹配 纸会在子弹飞出枪口时脱落
Grooves would match. Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

1128
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,300
子弹不会留下任何痕迹
Leaves no traces when it hits.

1129
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,040
你们的问题很有趣 希望你们满意
Interesting question, though. Hope I satisfied you.

1130
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,450
我还有个问题
I got another one.

1131
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,210
不出我所料
I thought you might.

1132
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,310
假如我寻找一个能在 两千两百码外命中目标的人
Suppose I was looking for a man to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

1133
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,120
有谁能办到？
Who's alive that could do that?

1134
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:00,820
听说有人不久前进行过那样的射击
Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago.

1135
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,060
据说那个人叫鲍勃・李・史瓦格
Said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger.

1136
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,390
我不认识他，所以无法证实
Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him.

1137
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,310
Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him.

1138
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,970
没错，他们是这么说的
Yeah, they said that, all right.

1139
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:11,770
我还听说人造糖精不会致癌
They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe,

1140
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,300
伊拉克有大规模杀伤武器
and WMDs were in Iraq,

1141
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,110
安娜・妮科尔*为了爱情而结婚！ *著名艳星，嫁给了比自己大63岁的亿万富翁

1142
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,990
and Anna Nicole married for love!

1143
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,910
不过暗杀总归不是好事
Would've been a bad job to take, though.

1144
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,080
怎么讲？
How come?

1145
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,740
开枪的人恐怕自己也活不成
Whoever took that shot's probably dead now.

1146
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:26,750
阴谋诡计都是这样收场
That's how a conspiracy works.

1147
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:30,510
那些在“草丘”*上的杀手也没活过3个小时 *据传真正刺杀肯尼迪的凶手隐藏在其中的人群里

1148
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,410
Them boys on the grassy knoll, they were dead within three hours.

1149
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,550
他们的尸体被埋在得林瓜*附近沙漠的无名墓地下

1150
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:35,450
Buried in the damn desert. Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

1151
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,060
你说的这些是真的么？
And you know this for a fact?

1152
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,960
铁锹我还留着呢
Still got the shovel.

1153
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,970
假如不是那个人干的呢？
Sake of argument, somebody other than him?

1154
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:44,600
俄罗斯还有个人
There was a guy in Russia.

1155
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,470
已被关进了监狱
They locked his ass up.

1156
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,840
有一个在法国，已经死掉了
Another one in France. I know he's dead.

1157
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,610
另外还有一个…
There was one guy,

1158
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:54,980
可他早就金盆洗手了
but he don't shoot no more.

1159
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,110
那是个极端残忍的家伙
A brutal son of a bitch.

1160
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,350
其他人直接射杀 他先把人打伤
Most boys shoot to kill. He'd shoot to wound,

1161
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,790
然后等他的朋友来救他
wait till his friends come to help,

1162
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,350
一起杀掉
kill them too.

1163
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,620
一次就干掉了四个
Turned one target into four.

1164
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,130
男的，女的，儿童 杀过好几百人呢
Men, women, children. Killed them by the hundreds.

1165
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,500
他的对手急于要他的命
The other side wanted him. Bad.

1166
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,900
最后在一栋废弃的六层楼里找到了他
Finally narrowed his hide down to an abandoned six-story building.

1167
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,040
那些人用了最极端的方法
They quit the subtle tactics.

1168
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,770
他们动用了炮火支援
They called in an artillery strike.

1169
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,780
整栋楼都没了
Leveled a square block.

1170
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,040
他被活活的埋在里面
Brought the building down on his ass.

1171
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,590
有人说他还是逃出去了
Some say he crawled out of there.

1172
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,420
有人说他死了
Some say he died.

1173
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,460
但没有人再提起他的消息
Never heard from him no more.

1174
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,720
见鬼
Fuck me.

1175
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:39,820
怎么？
What?

1176
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,360
我曾见过这个人
I met the son of a bitch.

1177
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,860
这个世界什么都可能发生 是吧，军士？
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems, is it, Gunnie?

1178
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,960
不，先生
No, sir.

1179
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,660
记住我的话
You keep that in mind.

1180
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,540
当你自以为明白的时候
The moment you think you got it figured,

1181
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,680
其实不然
you're wrong.

1182
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,810
他的名字？
He got a name?

1183
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,750
是我，尼克
Hey, it's me, Nick.

1184
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:10,790
你知道自己闯了多大的祸么？
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?

1185
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,520
知道 你还好吗？尼克，你在哪？
- Yeah. - Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

1186
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,860
你最好不要知道
It's better I don't tell you.

1187
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,060
有笔吗？
Look, do you have a pen?

1188
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,630
我要你帮我找一个人 叫米开罗・斯泽比亚克
I need you to find someone. Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

1189
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,700
好的 你记下了么？
- Yeah. - You got it?

1190
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,790
已经记下了
I got it.

1191
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,770
这个名字好难拼啊
Man, this is hard to spell.

1192
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:34,140
史瓦格会想尽一切办法
Swagger is going to go with what he knows.

1193
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,510
去寻找那个开枪的人
He'll try to track the shooter.

1194
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,140
那只是一厢情愿
He won't get far that way.

1195
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,740
并非如此
Yes, he will.

1196
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,950
什么意思？ 我们会帮他找到你
- How's that? - We're going to help him.

1197
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:45,120
要抓狼就得放饵
Sometimes to catch a wolf, you need to tie the bait to a tree.

1198
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,960
那饵下场会怎样？
And what happens to the bait?

1199
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,870
很难讲
Hard to say.

1200
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:00,530
有时候牺牲总是难免的
But that's the nature of being the bait.

1201
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,320
（米开罗・斯泽比亚克）

1202
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,950
我是尼克，找到他了吗？ 他在弗吉尼亚州
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him? - He's in Virginia.

1203
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,120
我们原本以为搞定的事情
An end we thought was tied up

1204
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:20,420
又出岔子了
came untied.

1205
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,020
什么意思，上校？
Meaning, Colonel?

1206
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,960
史瓦格还活着
Swagger is still alive.

1207
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,770
还活着
Oh, my.

1208
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:35,040
我现在需要一架海关免检的运输机
I need to land a transport plane without a customs check.

1209
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:40,310
我本不想打听 不过你要用它装什么？
I'm certain I don't want to know, but what's on the plane?

1210
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,880
我们用在埃塞俄比亚的人
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

1211
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,980
二十四名杀手
Twenty-four good, hard men.

1212
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,250
还有武器和装备
Weapons and gear.

1213
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,880
只有二十四名？
Only 24?

1214
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,730
必须除掉他
Do kill him.

1215
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,400
这次只许成功
No loose ends this time.

1216
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,700
晚安，上校
Night, Colonel.

1217
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:02,360
晚安，参议员
Good night, Senator.

1218
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,280
是谁？
Hello?

1219
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,890
有人么？
Someone there?

1220
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,820
{\an8}SIG-SAUER P226或P228（画面昏暗，很难判断）

1221
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,290
看看
Now look.

1222
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,320
{\an8}瑞士SIG公司80年代推出P226系列

1223
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,800
看看你都做了些什么
Look what you've done now.

1224
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,820
{\an8}228为226的紧凑型

1225
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:12,820
{\an8}此系列虽然表现比伯莱塔92F系列出色，但价格偏高

1226
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,500
把枪给我
Give me that.

1227
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:13,600
我可不想让你伤着自己？
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

1228
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:16,820
{\an8}所以在军队订单上一直占劣势

1229
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:21,820
但受到执法机构和特种作战单位的青睐

1230
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,950
你的男朋友呢？
Where's your boyfriend?

1231
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,170
弗吉尼亚州，林奇堡

1232
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,780
如果是陷阱怎么办？
What if it's a trap?

1233
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,590
就是陷阱
Oh, it's a trap.

1234
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:32,020
陷阱处处有
Guaranteed. Every time.

1235
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,590
问题是谁会掉进去？
Question is, for whom?

1236
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,930
购物清单好了吗？ 是的
- You got your list, right? - Yep.

1237
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,260
好，记住别买错
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

1238
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,300
走吧
Let's go.

1239
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,860
这些到底是干什么用的？
Okay, so what are these for again?

1240
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,270
催泪弹，由我来遥控
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

1241
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,930
好
Right.

1242
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,280
凝固汽油弹用在一层 铁管炸弹，用来对付其他人
Napalm on the first floor. Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

1243
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:30,410
这些东西要轻拿轻放 它的杀伤半径是十五英尺
Gotta be very careful with these. It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

1244
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,680
我们这是要干什么？
So what exactly are we getting ready for?

1245
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:34,220
要干的事可多了
For as much as we can be.

1246
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:44,820
{\an8}雷明登700

1247
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:49,820
{\an8}雷明登700旋转后拉式枪机步枪自1962年推出…

1248
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,600
你现在面对四个敌人
All right, you got four enemy combatants.

1249
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,430
把他们消灭
Take them one by one.

1250
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:54,820
{\an8}就以其精确性和威力受到称赞

1251
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,470
专心致志，别受环境的影响
Keep shooting. Don't let anything distract you.

1252
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:59,820
{\an8}它是世界上最强大的旋转后拉式枪机步枪

1253
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,820
{\an8}枪瞄：Leupold Mark4 M1

1254
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,140
见鬼！
Fuck!

1255
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:07,820
{\an8}调整手轮很长，而且顶端有很大的防滑凸起

1256
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,890
不是说过别受环境影响吗？
Didn't I say don't let anything distract you?

1257
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,820
{\an8}这样的设计即使戴上厚厚的手套也很容易使用
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Let's see it.

1258
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,510
慢就是稳，稳就是快，再来

1259
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,820
{\an8}所以很适合在寒带地区使用

1260
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:19,820
{\an8}旋转手轮时会发出轻微的“咔嗒”声，方便在夜间使用

1261
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,130
不，不
No. No.

1262
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,510
这里就我们两个，宝贝
It's just you and me, baby.

1263
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,670
不！
No!

1264
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,220
一共有三名警卫
You got three guards.

1265
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,550
一个在两点钟方向
One at your 2:00,

1266
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,050
一个在十二点钟
12:00

1267
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,550
一个在十点钟
and 10:00.

1268
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,190
两点方向有人靠近
Danger close. 2:00,

1269
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,270
就离你五十码
fifty yards.

1270
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:57,820
H&K G36KE

1271
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:02,820
G36步枪是德国H&K公司90年代初研制的

1272
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:07,820
已经装备了德国联邦国防军、西班牙军队

1273
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:10,820
以及大量国家的执法单位

1274
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:15,820
G36K是G36步枪的卡宾版本（K是德语“卡宾”的首字母）

1275
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:20,820
外貌特征是前护木是4个散热孔

1276
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:25,820
G36KE则是G36K的出口型，比标准版少一个红点瞄具

1277
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,960
一个在你正上方
You got one right on you.

1278
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,370
距离二十码，正在向你靠近
20 yards and closing.

1279
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,820
伯莱塔M92FS

1280
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:52,480
去看看周围的情况
Go check the perimeter.

1281
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,440
告诉大家保持警惕
And tell the others to stay alert.

1282
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,280
是，长官
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1283
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,820
伯莱塔M92FS

1284
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,950
史瓦格，屋顶还有一个
Swagger, you got one above you on the roof.

1285
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,980
三个都干掉了？
You killed all three?

1286
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,250
有四个
There were four.

1287
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,640
告诉我约翰逊的真名 我要知道他为谁工作
I want Johnson's real name. I want to know who he works for.

1288
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,620
为什么要大动干戈
I want to know why it was worth going through that much effort

1289
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,150
杀掉大主教？
to kill the Archbishop.

1290
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,580
是你杀的吗？
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1291
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,750
如果我什么都不知道呢？
And if I don't know any of those things?

1292
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,950
那就没必要留着你了
Then you're of no worth to me

1293
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,220
我会杀掉你，然后走掉
and I might as well shoot you now and leave.

1294
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,840
约翰逊有很多名字
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1295
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:20,700
我不知道到那一个是真的
Don't know one's any more real than the next.

1296
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,540
知道会很危险的
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1297
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,740
他当过陆军
He's ex-army.

1298
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,280
可以肯定他得过上校军衔
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1299
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:32,680
说下去
Go on.

1300
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,290
他们找到我就像找到你一样
They came for me, like they came for you.

1301
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,860
让我执行一次性任务
Recruitment for a single job.

1302
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,000
他们喜欢这样做
They like the wounded.

1303
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,760
用起来顺手
Easier to use

1304
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,770
用完了就可以丢掉，没人管
and then throw away when you are done.

1305
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:53,160
提蒙斯，你，我
Timmons, you, me...

1306
01:27:55,810 --> 01:28:00,750
人一旦变成狼就很难再 听人吩咐，任人宰割
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard to be staked down like a goat.

1307
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:06,620
我们两个死到临头的人 完全可以开诚布公了
This is just one dead man talking to another.

1308
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:09,020
大主教怎么回事？
And the Archbishop?

1309
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:14,490
你想杀人灭口又不引起怀疑么？
You want to take all suspicions away when you shoot someone,

1310
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,160
那就等他站在总统身边再下手
wait till he's standing next to the President.

1311
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,030
大主教想干什么？
What was he going to say?

1312
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:22,400
揭露真相
The truth.

1313
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,060
这种事情无论多么恐怖
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1314
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:29,670
要是没有政府点头是很难办到的
ever really happens without the approval of the government.

1315
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,770
国内国外都是如此
Over there, and here.

1316
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,680
问题不在于干了什么
The problem isn't the doing.

1317
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,280
而在于让当权者承认…
It's the people in power having to admit

1318
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,850
他们知情
that they knew.

1319
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,420
阿布格莱布监狱的囚犯受到虐待
The prisoners are tortured at Abu Ghraib,

1320
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,690
只有普通士兵受到处罚
and only the underlings go to jail.

1321
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,020
当官的完全知情
Their bosses knew.

1322
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:52,260
我们知道他们知情
We know their bosses knew.

1323
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,590
但谁也不说
But you don't say it.

1324
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,430
非洲到底发生了什么事？
What exactly happened in Africa?

1325
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:58,030
那些村民怎么也不相信
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1326
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:00,170
仅仅为了一条输油管道
that an oil pipeline

1327
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:03,540
就可以让他们背井离乡
was a good enough reason to move their village

1328
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,080
搬到一个没有圣灵保佑的地方
to a place where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1329
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,150
喝点？
Drink?

1330
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,310
就是说他们先劝说
So they asked them all nicely to move

1331
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,780
如果不从就杀掉？
and when they didn't, they just killed them all?

1332
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:11,850
不
No.

1333
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,310
根本不劝
They didn't ask.

1334
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:15,050
直接杀掉
They just killed them.

1335
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,120
全部杀掉
All.

1336
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:19,360
于是其他村子就不用劝了
So the next village won't need to be asked.

1337
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,790
都会听话的搬走
They'll just go.

1338
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:36,840
在一个大坑里埋了四百多具尸体
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1339
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:40,640
男人，女人，还有孩子…
men, women, children,

1340
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:45,380
就在厄立特里亚边境十公里远的 一个输油站下面
under the oil pumping station 10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

1341
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,590
你应该知道
You should know.

1342
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:52,720
正是你们保卫的那些 承包商杀害了他们
You covered the retreat of the contractors who did the job.

1343
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,860
当然，本来你也不该活着回来的
Of course, you weren't supposed to survive that, either.

1344
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:07,170
约翰逊受谁指使？
Who runs Johnson?

1345
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,670
一名议员，好像是蒙大拿州的
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1346
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:09,590
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1347
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,870
你不明白
You don't get it.

1348
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,410
你根本找不到罪魁祸首
There is no head to cut off.

1349
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,380
他们是一个利益共同体
It's a conglomerate.

1350
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,780
如果其中有谁背叛了
If one of them betrays the principles

1351
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,520
财富积累的原则
of the accrual of money and power,

1352
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,320
他就会被抛弃
the others betray him.

1353
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:35,530
这是人的贪婪本性所决定的
What it is

1354
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,450
is human weakness.

1355
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,810
是无法用枪除掉的
You can't kill that with a gun.

1356
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,680
史瓦格
Swagger.

1357
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:49,770
史瓦格
Swagger.

1358
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,680
你必须马上离开 到处都是他们的人
You got to get out of there. They're everywhere.

1359
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,580
我必须留住你等他们赶到
Had to keep you till they got here.

1360
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:02,820
{\an8}Walther P99

1361
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:01,360
谎话是留不住你的
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1362
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,690
你马上会识破
You would have known.

1363
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:07,820
{\an8}瓦尔特P99自动手枪由该公司于1997推出

1364
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,820
{\an8}握把部份可依照使用者的手掌大小，有3种尺寸可供选择

1365
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,970
顺带一提 你的女人在他们的手里
By the way, they've got your woman.

1366
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:17,820
{\an8}此枪的舒适性广受好评

1367
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,100
史瓦格
Swagger.

1368
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:19,670
他们离你只有二十码了 你必须马上出来
They're 20 yards and closing. You got to get out of there.

1369
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,350
快去第二隐蔽处 明白
- Bug out. Go to hide two. - Roger that.

1370
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,080
史瓦格，我到了第二隐蔽处
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1371
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,110
你必须马上离开
You got to get out of there.

1372
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,690
到处都是他们的人 嘿
- They're all over the place. - Hey!

1373
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:02,690
冷静点
Calm down.

1374
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:05,280
听我命令，引爆外面的铁管炸弹
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call, okay? You got it?

1375
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,390
我明白
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1376
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:15,940
听好了
Listen very carefully.

1377
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,730
我数到一 先引爆铁管炸弹
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1378
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,810
然后汽油弹
then the gas.

1379
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,600
三，二，一
Three, two, one...

1380
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,630
引爆汽油弹！
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1381
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,750
史瓦格！
Swagger!

1382
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,300
你一定行的
You got it.

01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:09,810
史瓦格！
Swagger!

1384

史瓦格！
Swagger!

1386
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:24,290
听我的命令，躲到后面谷仓去
You got to bug out on my go behind that barn.

1387
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,370
好的
Okay.

1388
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,520
准备好了？ 是的
- You ready? - Yeah.

1389
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,660
走！
Go!

1390
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,110
快走
Come on!

1391
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:41,820
俄罗斯RPD式轻机枪

1392
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:44,320
RPD式轻机枪是由前苏联捷格加廖夫

1393
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,820
于1943年设计、1946年开始批量生产的

1394
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,800
我们得躲到树林那边去
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1395
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,070
什么？
What?

1396
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,100
还有五发子弹把那鸟引过来
You got five shots left. Gotta draw that bird out.

1397
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,540
好的
Okay. Okay.

1398
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,510
我来掩护你 好的
- On my cover, all right? - Okay.

1399
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,270
好的！行动
All right, go!

1400
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:26,180
拉高！拉高！
Pull up! Pull up!

1401
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,230
是时候走了
Time to go!

1402
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,060
让我看看
Let me take a look.

1403
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,460
现在不行
Not right now.

1404
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,360
早上好，美人
Morning, beautiful.

1405
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:07,700
看到弗吉尼亚州的枪战了吗？ 长官？
- See this weird shootout in Virginia? - Sir...

1406
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:12,140
弹痕累累，到处是直升机残骸 和血迹，但就是没有尸体
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants, blood. No bodies, though, right?

1407
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,870
他们提取了两组留在弹壳上得指纹
And they get fingerprints off the cartridge cases.

1408
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:19,210
第一组毫无疑问是 鲍勃・李・史瓦格的
First set positively IDed as Bob Lee Swagger.

1409
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:26,320
第二组是 FBI 特工 尼克・孟菲斯的
Second set belongs to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1410
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,240
of the FBl.

1411
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,140
也许搞错了
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1412
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:34,950
对此我只想问一点…
Now, the only reasonable question to ask after that is,

1413
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:38,560
这他妈的到底是怎么回事？
what the fuck is going on?

1414
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:45,900
好枪法
Great shot!

1415
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,970
轮到你了，丹 好枪法
- All yours, Dan! - Good shooting!

1416
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,340
我开始觉得你不适合这份工作了
I'm beginning to think that you were the wrong man for the job.

1417
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,420
随你怎么想好了
Think what you want.

1418
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:04,910
我们显然低估了那个枪炮军士
It appears we misjudged the gunnery sergeant.

1419
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,720
总有个神经错乱的人
There's always a confused soul

1420
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,420
想要改变世界
that thinks that one man can make a difference.

1421
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,730
你必须要把他干掉 才能改变他的想法
And you have to kill him to convince him otherwise.

1422
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:20,040
这就是民主带来的麻烦
That's the hassle with democracy.

1423
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,570
发射
Pull!

1424
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,270
蒙大拿州，波兹曼

1425
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,860
已经火烧屁股了 明白我的意思吗？
...fire under their asses, you understand me?

1426
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,520
我要立刻拿到报告
We need those results now.

1427
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,960
安娜你马上派人去 那个歌舞餐厅
Anna, you guys, you take the team... Anna!... to the roadhouse.

1428
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,660
我现在不管是谁打来的
Okay, I don't care who it is right now. I don't give...

1429
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:47,930
安静！孟菲斯的电话
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1430
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,260
马上跟踪
Start a trace.

1431
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,760
没问题
Got it. I'm on it.

1432
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,100
尼克，我是霍华德 你怎么样？
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here. How are you?

1433
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:57,500
事情有点复杂了 我已经拘留了史瓦格
Things have gotten a little complicated. I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1434
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,550
没错，霍华德 他确实没有死
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1435
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:03,240
是的，我知道有那种可能
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility had begun to reach us.

1436
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,210
查到了
Got him.

1437
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,950
你似乎在弗吉尼亚参加了枪战？
Were you in a gunfight in Virginia last night?

1438
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:09,850
我说过了，事情变得有点复杂了
Like I said, things have gotten a little complicated.

1439
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,330
当然，如果你要是能把他带回来 那就再好不过了
Well, obviously the best thing for you would be to bring him in, right?

1440
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,330
不，我做不到
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1441
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,420
为什么？
Why?

1442
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:19,520
我不知道应该相信谁
It's gotten too deep. It's not clear who can be trusted.

1443
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,800
我们可是 FBI 是的，我知道
- But we're the FBl, son. - Yeah, I know.

1444
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,330
我会保持联系
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1445
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,730
尼克， 等等！
Oh, Nick, wait...

1446
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,740
该死的家伙！
Son of a bitch.

1447
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,870
查到了？ 嗯
- Did we get that? - Got him.

1448
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,070
我们出发 他们在蒙大拿州…
- Let's move. - They're on an interstate

1449
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,410
波兹曼市郊的州际公路 快出发
- outside Bozeman, Montana. - Let's move!

1450
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,150
我是史瓦格
This is Swagger.

1451
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,950
我是约翰逊上校 我知道你在监听
- Colonel Johnson here. - Figured you'd be listening.

1452
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,450
看来你走投无路了 上校？
- It appears you have nowhere to go. - Colonel?

1453
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,960
如果你真是上校？
If it is 'Colonel'?

1454
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:46,520
我是
It is.

1455
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:51,050
我这有你想要的东西 我也是
- I have something you want. - Well, it seems so do I.

1456
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:58,900
就在厄立特里亚边境 一个大坑里埋了四百多具尸体
Over the Eritrean border, there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

1457
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:01,700
男人，女人，还有孩子
Men, women, children.

1458
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,810
我可以拿它跟你作交换
Tell you what, I'll give it to you and we'll call it even.

1459
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:06,380
但我需要一个可以信任的中间人
I just want someone there I can trust.

1460
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,070
可以，你的人选是谁？
I'm amenable. Who do you have in mind?

1461
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:10,190
那个U2*组合里总戴副墨镜的家伙怎么样？ *爱尔兰著名乐队

1462
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,000
How about that guy from U2 with the glasses?

1463
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:12,690
他至少是纳尔逊・曼德拉*的朋友似乎值得信任 *南非首位黑人总统，诺贝尔和平奖获得者

1464
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:13,510
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all. He seems trustworthy.

1465
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:14,780
博诺*？你想要他们把博诺找来？ *U2乐队主唱，同时还是出色的社会活动家

1466
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:15,600
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1467
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:19,120
我的朋友不同意
My colleague's questioning my choice. Okay,

1468
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:22,720
我知道这太难为你了 那我就退一步
I see how that could be a tough problem. You know, last minute and all.

1469
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,030
蒙大拿州连任六届的参议员 查尔斯・米奇恩怎么样？
How about six-term senator Charles Meachum

1470
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,950
from Montana?

1471
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:29,970
我认为这是个不错的第二选择
Seems like a pretty good second choice, don't you think?

1472
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:33,000
我不这么想
I don't think so.

1473
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:35,970
我先给你提供两个数字 然后我们再谈
I'm gonna provide you with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1474
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,700
点 732，点 648
Point 732. Point 648.

1475
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:40,440
你到底什么意思？
And what the hell is that?

1476
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,710
他们是纬度和经度的后三位数字
Those are the last three digits, down to a few meters of latitude and longitude,

1477
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:45,810
地点是厄立特里亚一个输油站
of an oil pipeline pumping station in Eritrea

1478
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,250
下面埋有四百多具尸体
with 400 bodies underneath.

1479
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:49,150
我们在哪见面？
Where are we meeting?

1480
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,920
随便在哪都行
Somewhere I can see you,

1481
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:56,760
但是要在离你足够远的地方
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1482
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:06,600
你男朋友在哪？
Where's your boy?

1483
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:22,610
好吧，我到了
Well, I'm here.

1484
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,450
他来了
He's here.

1485
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,860
看啊
Look, look, look.

1486
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:36,720
那是你男友，宝贝
There's your boy. There's your boy, baby.

1487
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:47,500
快看，快看
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1488
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:53,820
雷明登700

1489
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,080
完事了
Okay.

1490
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,260
我好像断了一条肋骨
I think I broke a rib!

1491
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,090
别动
Don't move!

1492
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,970
还有其他狙击手吗？
Is there anybody else?

1493
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:50,540
没了
No.

1494
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:20,090
如果我被打中，她也不会活着
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1495
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,390
不许开枪
You got no shot!

1496
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,900
不许开枪，史瓦格你听到了没有？
No shot, Swagger! You hear that, Swagger?

1497
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,370
不许开枪
You got no shot!

1498
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,810
你想怎么样？
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1499
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:45,450
你完蛋了，伙计
It's over for you, buddy!

1500
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:53,130
不许开枪，干他
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1501
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:08,670
不赖嘛！
Not bad!

1502
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,980
够水平，好枪法，有两下子
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1503
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,550
见鬼
Christ.

1504
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,500
你有什么事？
How can we help you?

1505
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:35,770
一位住客给我一百美元
Guest at the motel last night gave me $100

1506
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,670
让我下午三点把这个送来
to bring this by here at 3:00 p. m.

1507
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:38,750
寄信人：尼克・孟菲斯

1508
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,540
行动！
Let's move!

1509
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,430
你没事吧？
You all right?

1510
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,210
没事
Yeah.

1511
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:25,560
搜一下
Search him.

1512
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,220
我没带武器
I don't carry a weapon,

1513
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:31,460
今天例外
ordinarily.

1514
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:34,160
我有本州的持枪许可证
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1515
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:42,820
{\an8}伯莱塔M92FS INOX

1516
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:43,470
要飞行员下来
Pull the pilot.

1517
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:45,320
{\an8}属于M9系列手枪，除底把外

1518
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,170
快把武器放下！
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1519
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,820
{\an8}大部分金属零件都是不锈钢

1520
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,440
把武器放下！
Put your gun down!

1521
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,670
冷静，冷静
Easy. Easy.

1522
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,180
莎拉
Sarah.

1523
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:03,860
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1524
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,330
好了，把枪给我
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1525
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,870
你没事吧？
You okay?

1526
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,640
举起手来，把手举起来
Put them up. Keep them up.

1527
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,300
好枪法，军士
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1528
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,980
你得到了你想要的东西
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1529
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:27,350
现在给我我想要的
I think it's time you owe us your side of the bargain.

1530
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:28,420
是吗？
You do, huh?

1531
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,550
是的，当然是的
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1532
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:35,220
我们姑且把这事看成
Why don't we think about all this that has gone on

1533
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:37,090
一个好的开始
just as a preamble?

1534
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,060
你有什么打算？
You got any plans after this?

1535
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:44,170
你的枪法很准 我很乐意为你提供一份工作
You have a rather unique skill set. I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1536
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,470
为你工作？
Work? For you?

1537
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:50,340
实际上没有你想的那么糟 我的目的不管怎样都会实现
It's not really as bad as it seems. It's all gonna be done in any case.

1538
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:54,000
站在我这边你可以 得到一份可观的薪水
You might as well be on the side that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1539
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:56,170
你是哪一边的？
And what side are you on?

1540
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,150
其实无所谓哪一边 无所谓逊尼派还是什叶派
There are no sides. There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1541
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:00,410
没有民主党也没有共和党
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1542
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,820
有的只是穷人和富人
There's only haves and have-nots.

1543
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,910
那我能为你干什么呢？参议员
What exactly does working for you entail, Senator?

1544
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:09,520
强奸妇女？杀戮儿童？ 你这变态
Raping and murdering innocent women and children, you sick fuck?

1545
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,460
为了一条输油管线
You sanctioned the mass murder of an entire village

1546
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,550
你居然能杀掉整个村的村民
so a pipeline could go through.

1547
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:14,260
就一个村的！
One village!

1548
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,390
但这给整个地区带来了安宁
And it brought stability to the region.

1549
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,670
从此以后他们不会因为
Which means that no one chops off their arms

1550
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:23,270
祖上属于不同的部落而进行仇杀
because their grandmother's grandfather

1551
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,190
belonged to a different tribe.

1552
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,770
他们喜欢我们，年轻人
They like us down there, boy.

1553
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,910
在我们国家
This is a country

1554
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,850
就连国防部长…
where the Secretary of Defense

1555
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,620
都能到电视上…
can go on TV

1556
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,120
对公众发表这样的演说词
and tell the American public,

1557
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:47,960
“这是为了自由不是为了石油”
oh, that 'This is about freedom! It's not about oil!'

1558
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:50,700
没有人会质疑他
And nobody questions him,

1559
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,670
因为没有人想揭穿他那十足的谎言
because they don't want to hear the answer

1560
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:53,590
because it's a lie!

1561
01:47:56,110 --> 01:48:00,340
进我的权力核心工作 没那么容易，军士
There's only so many places at the table, Gunnie.

1562
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:02,410
你是想进来呢？
Now are you on the inside,

1563
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,050
还是想留在外面？
or are you on the out?

1564
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,460
是 FBI！
It's the FBl!

1565
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:14,890
没关系，拿着
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1566
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:21,000
如果其中有谁背叛了 财富积累的原则…
If one of them betrays the principles of the accrual...

1567
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,760
你打错算盘了，参议员
I don't think so, Senator.

1568
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:28,940
你要干什么？ 救你我的命
- What are you doing? - Saving our lives.

1569
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:31,500
它能证明你是无辜的！ 这里没有无辜的人
- That proved you were innocent! - Nobody out here is innocent!

1570
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:35,450
这东西就像放射性物质 接触的人必死无疑
This stuffs plutonium. Nobody can handle it without dying.

1571
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:39,010
一旦交给当局 它就会跟我们一起消失
You hand it over to the authorities, it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1572
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:42,110
你不想被埋在郊外吧 我也不想被抓
Unless you want to get buried in the hills outside Terlingua.

1573
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,750
我不玩了，老鬼
I'm out, old man!

1574
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,650
我是个粗人，我习惯了 在山顶过艰苦的日子
I'm just a peckerwood who lives in the hills with too many guns.

1575
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,060
你满意了吗？
You happy?

1576
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:54,130
你们去哪？
Where do you think you're going?

1577
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:55,670
回华盛顿
Washington!

1578
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:00,210
你想从背后杀死 一位在任的参议员？
You going to shoot a sitting U.S. senator in the back?

1579
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:01,860
老实说，我很想
Lord knows I want to.

1580
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:04,180
你不会这样做的
I didn't think so.

1581
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:06,640
让他走
Let him go.

1582
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,310
他们拿到了你的步枪
They've got your rifle.

1583
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,350
他们一开始就拿到了你的步枪
From the beginning, they've always had your rifle.

1584
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:15,110
就在谋杀的现场
Recovered at the site.

1585
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,520
无论你怎样辩解
You can talk as much as you want, but in the end,

1586
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,120
最终还是会被判处注射死刑* *向犯人体内注射毒药的一种死刑

1587
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,010
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1588
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,690
而我？该干嘛还是干嘛
and I'm going to go back to what I was doing.

1589
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:37,030
我赢了
I won.

1590
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,440
你输了
You lost.

1591
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:42,410
听天由命吧，孩子
Get used to the idea, son.

1592
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,320
我不是你的孩子
I'm not your son.

1593
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:01,230
放下武器 ！放下武器！ 别动
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now! - Don't move!

1594
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:04,900
我是尼克・孟菲斯探员 我是 FBI，别开枪！
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBl! Don't shoot!

1595
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,170
趴下！ 趴在地上
- Down, now! - On the ground!

1596
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:08,800
我说趴下！
I said get down!

1597
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:11,290
司法部，华盛顿特区

1598
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,790
可以给我解开吗？ 可以
- Could I free my hands, please? - It's okay.

1599
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,520
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

1600
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,660
谢谢把她带来
Thanks for bringing her.

1601
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:43,840
我对这一切很抱歉
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1602
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,240
不怪你，事情就是这个样子的
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1603
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:52,610
这位是司法部长罗瑟
This is Attorney General Russert.

1604
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,210
联邦调查局局长布兰特 长官
- Director Brandt. - Sir.

1605
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,650
米奇恩议员今天不能到场
Senator Meachum couldn't be with us today.

1606
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,920
没有他我们一样可以开会
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1607
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:05,820
{\an8}Cheytac Intervention M200

1608
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,260
史瓦格军士 这次会议是你要求的
Sergeant Swagger, you asked for this meeting.

1609
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:07,560
尽管我不情愿 但看在 FBI 的面子上我还是同意了
Against my better judgment, I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBl.

1610
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:09,130
这里有我什么事？
What the hell am I doing here?

1611
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:11,460
我和本案毫无牵连，我是清白的
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1612
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,340
你可以去问参谋长联席会议* *美国军事体系中军令系统的最高指挥机构，负责拟制、组织实施战略计划等
Call the Joint Chief.

1613
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:16,270
没必要，上校
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1614
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:18,740
我至少接到了十几个电话
as I have already received no less than a dozen calls

1615
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:21,900
高官们都要求我能够放你一马
from highly-ranked and powerfully-placed individuals

1616
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:22,820
telling me to let you go.

1617
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:25,030
但令人欣喜的是，我们宪法规定的权力制衡*体制 *行政、立法、司法三权分立，每一分支都对另两个分支具有制约作用，从而形成权力平衡

1618
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:26,030
But the joy of checks and balances in our government is that I can,

1619
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:30,850
以法律的名义叫他们滚蛋
and am, indeed, required by law,

1620
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,770
to tell them to fuck off.

1621
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,620
这次会议是为了查明真相
This is about evidence and finding out the truth,

1622
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:34,660
所以你最好坐着别乱开口
so you sit there and be quiet.

1623
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:40,290
军士，给你五分钟的时间
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1624
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,530
谢谢
Thank you.

1625
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:45,470
这是我的步枪
This is my weapon.

1626
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,900
毫无疑问，我不否认
No question about it, don't deny it.

1627
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:50,370
你们很快就在现场找到了它
You recovered it at the scene moments after the assassination.

1628
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,440
没异议
We agree?

1629
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:53,700
此后一直由 FBI 保管
It's been in the FBl's possession ever since,

1630
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:55,210
保证没有人动过？
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1631
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:56,840
没有，绝对没有
No. Absolutely not.

1632
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:59,080
你用它射击过吗？ 没必要
- You fire the weapon? - There was no point.

1633
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:01,350
子弹已经损毁得无法辨认了
The slug was mangled beyond recognition.

1634
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:04,360
但是经过材质鉴定完全吻合
It was, however, an exact metallurgical match.

1635
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,820
没错，这绝对是我的子弹
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1636
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,620
这绝对是我的步枪
Definitely my gun.

1637
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:12,200
孟菲斯，你相信是我开的枪吗？
Special Agent Memphis, you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1638
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,820
不，我不相信
Nope. No, I don't.

1639
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:16,460
你有什么证据吗？ 没有
- Have any proof of this fact? - No.

1640
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:18,000
你相信我吗？ 是的
- Trust me? - Yep.

1641
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,260
真的相信？
Really trust me?

1642
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,610
真的
Yeah.

1643
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:22,870
用性命担保
With your life?

1644
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,880
是的 那好
- Yep. - Good.

1645
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:28,810
你想干什么？ 把枪放下
- What the hell are you doing? - Put that weapon down now!

1646
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,750
如果这么近距离射击 枪口要再低一些
If you're zeroed for 600, you ought to aim a little lower.

1647
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:33,340
这么近，没有必要
Ain't gonna make a difference this close.

1648
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:36,210
关键要看我是不是疯了
Only thing that's gonna make a difference

1649
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:36,130
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1650
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:44,390
我经常花一整天摆弄…
I could keep doing this all day,

1651
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,720
家里所有的武器
with every weapon in my house.

1652
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:50,290
但在我出门的时候，我总是把所有的撞针*都拆掉 *用以撞击底火发射子弹的枪械物件
I swapped all the firing pins before I left the house. I always do.

1653
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,430
很难察觉，除非用千分尺来测量
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1654
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:54,270
但枪绝对打不出子弹
But the gun don't shoot.

1655
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:56,670
大主教身上的子弹 的确出自我的步枪
That bullet you got out of that bishop was fired from my weapon,

1656
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:58,540
那是一周前打铁罐用的
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1657
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,880
我发过誓要忠于祖国 抵抗国内外敌人侵害
I did take an oath to defend this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1658
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:04,280
但没想到有人要陷害我
I just didn't figure I'd end up quite this involved.

1659
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:06,150
当尘埃落定之后
But at the end of the day, when all the dust settles,

1660
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,810
你不要以为真相可以 轻易掩盖，混蛋
you can't hide from the truth, you son of a bitch.

1661
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,250
随你的便
Whatever.

1662
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:13,490
谁会相信？
Who gives a shit?

1663
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,290
你表演得不错
Nice presentation.

1664
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,190
可跟我毫无关系
But none of it sticks to me.

1665
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,600
先生们，会议结束了
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1666
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:23,960
结束了
Done.

1667
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:25,400
后会有期
I'll be seeing you.

1668
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:28,700
他说得对，没有证据说明他犯了罪
He's right. There's nothing to prove he did anything.

1669
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,000
在国内没有
Yeah, in this country.

1670
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,740
先生，你应该看看这个
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1671
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:43,610
这些照片来自于一份绝密文件 能证明在非洲的一个村子里
These images are from a classified file showing a village of people in Africa

1672
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,420
全部村民被上校和他的同伙杀掉
that were exterminated by the colonel and his associates.

1673
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,490
上帝啊
My God.

1674
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:48,890
请不要忘记
Look around you.

1675
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,590
这里不是非洲之角
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1676
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,260
那只是些传闻
That's all hearsay.

1677
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:55,990
这里是自由之地，勇敢者的家园
This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.

1678
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,540
我有离开的自由
And I'm free to go.

1679
01:53:58,170 --> 01:53:59,970
上校，你的道德观完全变态了
Colonel, your moral compass is so fucked up,

1680
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:04,010
我怀疑你是否还能 面不改色心不跳地回到停车场
I'll be shocked if you manage to find your way back to the parking lot.

1681
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:06,240
不管我对这些事情有怎样的看法
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1682
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,770
它都是发生在别的国家
these events occurred in another country,

1683
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,180
不是我国境内
outside of our laws.

1684
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,810
原来是这样？就没有别的办法吗？
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1685
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:14,940
这里不是国际法庭，军士
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1686
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:18,120
我无权扣留上校
And I don't have the jurisdiction to detain the colonel

1687
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:20,890
不管他是否真的在国外 犯下了那些罪行
for crimes he may or may not have committed on another continent.

1688
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:24,520
先生，我恳请你重新考虑一下 没什么可考虑的
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider... - There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1689
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,630
我赢了
I win.

1690
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:30,960
而你这次
You lose.

1691
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,670
又输了
Again.

1692
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,600
简直太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

1693
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:02,460
说实话我比你更不喜欢这个结果
For the record, I don't like the way this turned out any more than you do.

1694
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:05,070
但这就是我们生活的世界
But this is the world we live in.

1695
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:08,110
法律也不是万能的
And justice does not always prevail.

1696
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:09,170
这不是早期的西部
It's not the Wild West,

1697
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,570
不能用枪解决所有问题
where you can clean up the streets with a gun.

1698
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:15,750
尽管有时你必须那样做
Even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed.

1699
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,920
鲍勃・李・史瓦格，你自由了
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1700
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:28,860
给他打开脚镣
Unshackle the sergeant.

1701
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,430
我们打出了一记重拳，参议员
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1702
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:35,800
正中目标
In the face.

1703
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,430
有句话说得好
You heard that expression,

1704
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,840
“打掉牙齿只能往肚里吞”
'You didn't know whether to shit or go blind'?

1705
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,820
{\an8}H&K G36KE

1706
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:49,040
你真该看看司法部长脸上的表情
You should've seen the look on the Attorney General's face.

1707
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:54,450
他是不是又谈 “权力制衡”的老调了？
Did he give his checks-and-balances speech?

1708
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:57,950
“这是为了举证和查明真相”
'This is about evidence and the truth!'

1709
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:00,580
你应该直接了当地对他说
And then you just said to him,

1710
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:01,990
“见你的鬼”
'Fuck you!'

1711
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,460
“一边呆着去，部长先生”
'Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G.'

1712
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:09,030
见你的鬼
'Fuck you!

1713
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,240
我说的话就是真相
'The truth is what I say it is!'

1714
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,640
你明天一早就离开美国
You know, you got to be out of the country in the morning.

1715
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:24,510
去厄瓜多尔
You're going to Ecuador.

1716
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:31,580
我们和当地人弄出了点麻烦
Well, we're having some problems with the locals.

1717
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:35,250
我们的人已经做好准备把事情摆平
We have our personnel on the ground ready to neutralize the problem, but...

1718
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,220
不过点名要你帮忙
Well, they've requested you.

1719
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,360
小事一桩
It's solvable.

1720
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,230
他们点名要你
They requested you...

1721
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:47,600
史瓦格
Swagger.

1722
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,540
把灯关掉
Turn off the lights!

1723
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:02,140
去开车！
Get my car.

1724
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,450
去开车！
Get my car.

1725
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:24,280
快想办法
Do something.

1726
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,310
快想办法
Do something!

1727
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:35,750
他在哪？
Where is he?

1728
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:51,820
{\an8}M1911系列

1729
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:49,560
在地板下面
He's under the floor!

1730
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:54,320
柯尔特 M1911 式点45口径自动手枪

1731
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,820
是世界上最著名的手枪之一

1732
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:01,820
是世界上装备时间最长，装备量最大的手枪

1733
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:21,960
你没必要杀我
You don't need to kill me.

1734
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:24,930
你没必要杀我，是他们干的！
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1735
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:26,340
他们干的！
It was them.

1736
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:31,910
等等！请等一下！
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1737
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:36,510
冷静一下
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1738
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:42,250
你是不是疯了？ 是不是真的发疯了？
Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your damn mind?

1739
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:45,190
我是美国的现任参议员
I am a United States senator!

1740
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:46,360
那更该死
Exactly.

1741
02:00:55,830 --> 02:01:00,530
-= 谢谢观看 =-
