1
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,374
We are never infinitely far from those whom we hate.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,665
For the same reason,

3
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,624
we will never be quite close to those we love.

4
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,040
An atrocious principle

5
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,874
I already knew when I embarked.

6
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,082
But there are truths that deserve our attention,

7
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,040
and there are others that it is better to work around them.

8
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,665
We set sail 67 days ago.

9
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,832
September, 1914.

10
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:02,457
The matches are not much help on deck.

11
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,374
Thank you.

12
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,415
There you are their island.  Look, do you see it?

13
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,165
What is fleeing?

14
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,915
That was the first thing they asked me when I decided to get to the sea.

15
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,249
Prepare to lead anchors.

16
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,332
You can do a person, not two.

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,332
Do not listen, Russian.

18
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,340
Watch out for back there, not wet.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,749
Careful with that.  That you can not drop anything.

20
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,082
C'mon C'mon.

21
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,540
No birds.

22
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,582
Or meteorologist to welcome him.

23
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,665
Captain, where did we leave things Officer airs and winds?

24
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,415
Here.

25
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,832
Tell the others not bring other supplies.

26
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,374
No, that they may bring.

27
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,790
With all due respect, it's my responsibility to get well

28
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,582
and this is not very reassuring.

29
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,624
You have already done their duty.

30
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,457
It should be understood as a kindness

31
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,999
Captain accompany me to the mainland.

32
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,915
Nothing forced him to it.

33
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,415
But throughout the trip, we started understanding

34
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,790
that sometimes arise between men of different generations.

35
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:26,207
The captain always treated me with courtesy of an executioner.

36
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,832
If I could do something for me, I would.

37
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,165
GRUNER OWNS THIS SOURCE

38
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,207
Guys, go back to the boat.

39
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,749
Is there someone?

40
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,415
¡Abra!

41
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,915
Can you hear me?

42
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,457
Hello!

43
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,665
Hello?

44
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,707
Hey!  Awakes.

45
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,749
Go for water, toadface.

46
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
Wake up!

47
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,915
Technician maritime signals,

48
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,374
I bring over from meteorologist, Aldor Vigeland.

49
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,082
Can you tell me where it is?

50
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,124
I said that is where the meteorologist.

51
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,582
Listen, I am the captain of a ship in transit,

52
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,290
I have digressed to bring it here

53
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,207
and take me to his predecessor.

54
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,624
Where is...?

55
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,791
Typhus.

56
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,125
Is dead?

57
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,832
You do snuff?  Vodka?

58
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,457
Where are his remains?

59
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,540
For God's sake, speak!

60
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,040
He left one day and already I have not seen him since.

61
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,207
For the love of God, is an island!

62
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,040
How much could have been removed?

63
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,458
Swimming ¿?

64
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,332
Your name?

65
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,208
Gruner.

66
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,707
Do you like Frazer?

67
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,290
The book is not mine.

68
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,374
You, you have snuff?

69
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,207
Above, no.

70
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,499
Sr. Gruner.

71
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,124
Captain,

72
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,124
I appreciate your concern but I will not return.

73
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Take this.

74
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,540
Do not confuse stubbornness with stupidity.

75
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,708
I'll manage me.

76
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,790
Thank you for everything you have done.

77
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,583
Eat well.

78
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,374
I worked a lot.

79
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,374
Keep busy.

80
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,332
Good winds.

81
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,165
And best seas.

82
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,249
For twelve months would have to live there,

83
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,165
in a solitude of exile,

84
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,415
far from any civilized coast,

85
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,665
with such monotonous work as insignificant:

86
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,540
record the intensity and direction of winds.

87
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,915

Sr. Gruner.

95
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:23,178
Sr. Gruner.

96
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,290
Mr. Gruner, if this is your way to Init ...

97
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,040
Open the door!

98
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,832
Let me in.

99
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,071
¡Gruner!

100
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,159
¡Gruner!

101
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:43,978
¡Gruner!

102
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,457
- Please, let me in! - he should have stayed on the boat.

103
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,524
¡Gruner!

104
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,844
¡Gruner!

105
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,207
When fear overwhelms me that I can die,

106
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:24,040
without having my pen reaped the fruits of my soul

107
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,707
nor lift up my books stacked

108
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,499
as in the barn the mature grain.

109
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,915
When I look on the face starry night,

110
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,290
large cloud symbols of a high legend,

111
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,207
and I think I never live to trace their shadows

112
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,207
with maga hand of fate;

113
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,832
and when I feel, fair creature of an instant,

114
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,999
that I can never look at you

115
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,457
or enjoy the magical power of passionate love,

116
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,874
then, at the edge of the vast world I am alone

117
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,374
and I think until love and glory sink into nothingness.

118
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,374
Holy Virgin!

119
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:12,666
¡No!

120
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,624
- Do not shoot! - Put the gun down!

121
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,874
¡Bájela!

122
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,874
Behind!

123
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,624
What does he want?

124
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,915
Really I have to explain?

125
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,832
You said you had snuff?

126
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:47,833
Yes.

127
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,166
¿Café?

128
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,349
Yes.

129
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,665
- Vodka? - Geneva.

130
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,707
And ammunition.

131
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,540
What caliber?

132
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,665
I have more.

133
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,040
- It's harmless. - lnofensiva?

134
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,832
They come here, come ... here.

135
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Come on.

136
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,583
¿Lo ve?

137
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,457
I think I'll call Friend.

138
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,207
You've been bitten.

139
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,750
I've burned.

140
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,374
- How many killed? - I do not know.

141
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,290
The official meteorological old ...

142
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,041
It was not typhus.

143
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,124
He left lying here like me.

144
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:09,290
- counts as murder. - We have to go.

145
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,749
Come on!

146
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:54,540
Already it does not hurt?

147
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,040
- How long was I asleep? - I reckon a day or two.

148
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,415
It has been peed on.

149
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,249
1862.

150
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,540
That's what I call an arsenal.

151
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,915
That makes?

152
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,874
Petite stupid. He believes things will fly ...

153
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:36,624
- You can talk to the animals. - Speak not, order.

154
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,165
Do not try to escape?

155
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,040
¿Huye a dog in the most cruel master?

156
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,166
Is incredible.

157
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,165
I never imagined that something like this could exist.

158
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,457
We know it's a small island in the great ocean with something unknown.

159
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,874
I have read that there are atolls with unique and endemic fish species

160
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,001
which they have evolved completely freely.

161
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,790
The species that survived were in isolation.

162
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,749
They have been trapped in a sort of evolutionary stagnation.

163
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:20,374
Perhaps these beasts are well, not quite human

164
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:23,415
or amphibian or reptile or ictícolas.

165
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,832
She is not like the others, right?

166
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,165
This does not bite, that's all.

167
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,624
And what about that scar on your shoulder?

168
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,832
He did once, the only time.

169
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,374
He learned the lesson.

170
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:42,833
Remember,

171
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,540
Mansa below the current water is worse.

172
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:56,665
I have adjusted the mechanism to track the coast.

173
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,415
For all I know, the face of toads like all hell beasts

174
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,915
avoid light, human or divine.

175
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,499
- They are demons of Atlantis. - I believe in what I see.

176
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,915
The only thing I can not understand

177
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:14,415
It is that it could have run 4 days ago on the ship that brought me here.

178
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,707
- Run away where? - the civilized world.

179
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,040
Nice place that yours civilized world.

180
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,124
So why did he quit?

181
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:29,165
Here I am the master of my destiny against all odds.

182
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,874
Well, you can keep it. I will sign the first ship to pass.

183
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:33,790
Really?

184
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,499
This island is not in any commercial maritime route,

185
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,059
the next boat will bring his replacement.

186
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,083
Come on, Gruner.

187
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,045
The headlights are built where naval traffic.

188
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,165
And to balance the budgets of the Navy and divert funds.

189
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,624
You have to empty a bucket before filling it again.

190
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:57,332
It is the second time in a week that I am forced to rebuild my life.

191
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,165
All my belongings are burned.

192
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,790
I have nothing left of the person you used to be.

193
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:10,499
In this remote part of the world, I feel an irreparable loss.

194
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:15,124
I do not know if it is a manifestation of nostalgia for civilization,

195
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,625
SEPTEMBER 2, 1914

196
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,040
panic a prisoner or,

197
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,416
simply fear.

198
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,665
Do not! Do not eat it!

199
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,415
It is not edible.

200
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,040
It is a bird...

201
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:24,932
Friend,

202
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,290
take his rifle.

203
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,790
Do not fire until they reach the tower and do not waste bullets wounded.

204
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,624
Give them enough carrion and devour each other.

205
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,499
I see nothing.

206
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,040
And you learn what to look for.

207
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:02,499
Come on!

208
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,790
Shoot, man! Use your weapon!

209
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,624
Come on! Shoot!

210
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,207
You are welcome!

211
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,165
Nobody is an island.

212
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:22,749
What a stupid thing.

213
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,040
Gruner is an island.

214
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,374
Gruner does not need a charge.

215
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:35,624
As much chocolate and coffee that has brought miedica.

216
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,124
Go to water.

217
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,165
Last chance!

218
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,625
Companies.

219
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,250
Firm hold.

220
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,166
I waited.

221
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,416
Companies.

222
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,040
Prepared.

223
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:32,333
Behind him.

224
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:37,249
Wake up, man! Wake up! Shoot, dammit! Shoot!

225
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,874
It's your last chance!

226
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,499
Do not close, Gruner!

227
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,415
No, Gruner! I waited! Do not!

228
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,249
Let me go!

229
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:00,999
¡Gruner!

230
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,332
Let me go! Gruner!

231
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:49,749
Between Gruner and a curious coexistence prevailed

232
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,207
based on the routine.

233
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,830
The monsters always appear in packs at night

234
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,374
and they expand their attacks more and more every day.

235
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,332
The Japanese philosopher Musashi said

236
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,249
they are few who appreciate the art of war.

237
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,249
OCTOBER

238
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:08,415
Good fighter is not defined by the cause he defends,

239
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:11,415
but by the sense that knows how to extract the fight.

240
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,999
The days are always the same,

241
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:19,040
at daybreak drop guard on the balcony.

242
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,790
I sleep as much as I ask nature.

243
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,249
I have to accept the most thankless tasks

244
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:28,249
just to keep my place in the lighthouse.

245
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:33,374
I've been pondering the reason that brought me to this island.

246
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,790
He had been seeking peace of nowhere,

247
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:44,665
and instead of silence, I found a monster-ridden hell.

248
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,415
It smells funny.

249
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:54,082
- How do you know that are not weeds? - Herbs are like people.

250
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,040
They are neither good nor bad, are known or not, that's all.

251
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:00,040
Herbs not slaughtered him for money.

252
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,165
A farmer raises cows.

253
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,790
Cares for, feeds them, gives them endearing names

254
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,540
Margarita.

255
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,040
But then steals your milk

256
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,124
and kill their young.

257
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,499
Another riddle.

258
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,874
It is a matter of necessity.

259
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:25,207
Did not it occur to you that could be what attracts your bellowing beasts?

260
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:29,999
So why do they attack some nights and not others?

261
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,915
And why he would appeal to his blood to die on the rocks?

262
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,124
All you have to understand

263
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,999
It is that we are the invaders

264
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,082
and that make us the enemy.

265
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,332
Kill and conquer, that's what humans do.

266
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,249
Wants to conquer, is that it?

267
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,624
Oh, no, I destroy them.

268
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,374
We need more wood.

269
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,041
Why?

270
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,332
For weeks they have not attacked us.

271
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,624
He likes to sleep in my lighthouse.

272
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,749
Marchito.

273
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:23,582
In the distance.

274
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,874
Dissolved.

275
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,832
And quite forgotten.

276
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,874
My gaze has traveled a thousand times all surfaces.

277
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:05,082
We talk about Lighthouse domains as a province.

278
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:07,768
Every nook and cranny has its name.

279
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,290
Every rock,

280
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,790
each stone.

281
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,040
Perhaps like whales migrate in winter.

282
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,415
Or maybe the creatures have figured out that they can not defeat us.

283
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,832
They are beasts.

284
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:32,749
They are out there to multiply for your next attack.

285
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,332
It's up to guard.

286
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,999
Often, strange,

287
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:49,040
breaks between attacks are worse than the attacks themselves.

288
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:55,040
This parenthesis is accompanied by the change of attitude of the pet.

289
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:31,915
How could Gruner fornicate

290
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:35,540
with one of those same monsters that beset us every night?

291
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,915
How could justify the act

292
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:47,874
defying all obstacles established by civilization

293
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,082
and established by nature?

294
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:10,540
How could closer

295
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,665
and more

296
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:20,415
and not feel repulsed by her cold skin?

297
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,874
I decided to give it a name.

298
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,291
Aneri.

299
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,583
Down!

300
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:04,707
- When the potatoes are finished? - They were not finished, it's you're drinking.

301
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,458
Play?

302
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:19,749
What civilized man does not?

303
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,415
These beasts are fascinating species.

304
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,499
Blood, for example,

305
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,790
guessing they share properties

306
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,040
some Arctic fish

307
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:38,499
having as an antifreeze that helps them survive below zero.

308
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,790
Have you noticed that have two sets of eyelids?

309
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,665
The first is very similar to ours,

310
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,332
but the second is a transparent membrane

311
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,226
who is helpful when immersed, I imagine.

312
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,582
We could capture some specimens,

313
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,040
take them back to Britain or the United States,

314
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,184
present our discovery and we recognize ...

315
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,665
Okay, you've convinced me.

316
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,207
I have come to this damn world to become famous, okay?

317
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,040
Check! Shut up and play.

318
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,457
Checkmate.

319
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,249
No, it can not be.

320
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,624
- Can not be. - Calm down, Gruner, it's just a game.

321
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,749
- Reyes, peons ... - It can not be.

322
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,540
We have forgotten light. The upstairs balcony.

323
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,915
Come on, there are too many. There are too many.

324
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,540
So, what can we do now?

325
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:08,124
A Starry Night

326
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:13,499
While sleeping;

327
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,582
A Starry Night

328
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,457
while she is lying in bed.

329
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,874
I dreamed I was listening

330
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,374
the wagon wheels screeching.

331
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:33,082
Molly Ban, darling,

332
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:36,332
come to bed.

333
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,207
Look at us, we can not survive another assault like that.

334
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,332
We are running out of supplies,

335
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,790
we're running out of ammo, we are running out of free will.

336
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,124
Where are you going?

337
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,999
What happen?

338
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,290
There is a boat.

339
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,291
¡No!

340
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:27,874
Gruner knows how to defend himself.

341
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:29,832
Gruner rules the world.

342
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,540
Gruner want what you have and only has what he wants.

343
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,915
Ungrateful little beast.

344
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:44,665
- Stay away. - Gruner, please.

345
00:54:58,083 --> 00:54:59,457
No more people.

346
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,082
I see what you are.

347
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,457
A pitiful and ridiculous attempt failed misanthrope.

348
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:11,790
It is too scared to let go of his friends.

349
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,335
It is too scared to kill their enemies.

350
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,249
Scares you have no one to hate.

351
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:45,999
Do not you dare leave! Do you hear me?

352
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,665
Damn you, toadface.

353
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,583
Look.

354
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:39,626
Look.

355
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,374
What did you do this time?

356
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:13,665
Call

357
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:15,832
ship.

358
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,207
You see it?

359
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,458
What?

360
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,040
I found a boat.

361
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,333
Already knew.

362
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,999
Sorry, as it says? Why did you not tell me?

363
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:03,165
would not serve. Certainly I go out of my island,

364
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:07,499
but it would be attacked by hypothermia, hunger, a storm.

365
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:09,976
Most likely it ends up as food for frogs face,

366
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,040
but hey, who am I to deny the right to choose how you want to die?

367
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,207
- Where he came from? - It was the Portuguese.

368
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,582
- A wreck? - A big storm

369
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:22,101
It caused a disgrace overnight.

370
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,082
I'm sure he did everything he could to save them.

371
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,665
I did what I could.

372
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,874
Those who came ashore tried to reach the lighthouse.

373
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:35,207
There was nothing left of them in the morning. They were dragged back to the bottom.

374
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:37,915
What were you doing so far from trade routes?

375
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,624
It was an illegal boat. Bootleggers dynamite.

376
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:43,999
I found some boxes that were washed ashore.

377
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:46,290
But do not work, are flooded by water.

378
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,249
- He wants to dive to the ship. - and retrieve dynamite.

379
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:10,415
We repaired the boat and set off when the tide when it is safer.

380
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:12,832
He's an idiot.

381
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,976
What he does not like to blow a thousand toads face the air?

382
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,892
It's a suicide mission, I will not dive into that water.

383
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:18,916
He is afraid?

384
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I will do.

385
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,540
- I just need to pump me air. - It will not work.

386
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,851
I'm talking about the extermination of frogs face.

387
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:31,875
No.

388
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:24,915
I've changed my mind.

389
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,415
We left right away.

390
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,707
Remember, a rope pull, everything goes well.

391
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,457
Two, cargo is subject.

392
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:04,625
Three...

393
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,915
Three reme with all his strength.

394
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,832
The second line is too close to the lighthouse.

395
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,790
At this distance, the toads will face tight,

396
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,665
like a can of sardines.

397
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:36,749
We end up perched on the Leaning Tower of Pisa

398
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,332
The austral summer is extinguished shyly, but with magnificence.

399
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:07,999
Now we move inexorably towards winter,

400
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,749
or rather, into the darkness.

401
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:21,790
Time is a relative idea.

402
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:28,457
Droplets suspended in a cobweb can take ages to fall.

403
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,749
Sometimes, however,

404
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:34,665
one week passes in a blink of an eye.

405
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,166
Between.

406
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:59,124
Three weeks. Three weeks and nothing.

407
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,915
- We can not eat that crap. - Gruner.

408
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,415
It was ratted. You are what you told your friends, huh?

409
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:35,165
You've warned them, right?

410
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:37,707
Toadface damn spy.

411
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:40,915
So you pay me, huh? Damn ungrateful!

412
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:44,207
How dare you leave me! How dare you!

413
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:45,832
Lnténtalo again!

414
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,249
They tend an ambush,

415
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:53,999
We leave the door open and we attract to come,

416
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,707
deals with them on the stairs

417
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:58,874
and triggered the detonator when they are close enough.

418
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,540
Gruner, Babel is open.

419
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,999
- And the lanterns? - Ignitions.

420
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,832
C'mon C'mon. ¡Sing!

421
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,540
Sing! ¡Canta cena para you! Sing!

422
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:57,535
Sing! Sing!

423
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,182
They're inside!

424
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:12,665
They are already here!

425
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,374
It does not work!

426
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,750
The connection!

427
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,582
Crouch!

428
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:16,291
¡No, Gruner...!

429
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,518
Gruner.

430
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:18,873
Gruner.

431
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:22,582
Gruner, can you hear me?

432
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,291
Gruner.

433
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,457
Under the vast starry sky,

434
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:44,415
Dig the grave and let me lie there.

435
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:48,249
I lived happily and gladly die,

436
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:51,707
I slept with one last wish.

437
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,832
Use your knife, do not waste ammunition.

438
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:00,374
Look what we've done.

439
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:52,457
It will do that for a while.

440
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,624
It will not stop mourn that way.

441
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:00,915
So I found,

442
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:05,499
He had been entangled.

443
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,999
They seem so cute like that, right?

444
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,832
But change.

445
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:19,624
I freed myself, I saved his life.

446
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,207
He'll come crawling back.

447
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:30,999
He always does.

448
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,249
They are mourning.

449
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:46,540
Look at this,

450
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:49,707
It is magnificent.

451
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:54,707
We have to keep up appearances with new and more powerful weapons.

452
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,582
We must continue metiéndoles fear.

453
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:11,082
I see you, king of the toads face!

454
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,707
Not hurt them, Gruner.

455
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:15,999
They just want a truce.

456
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:19,457
Gruner, lower the gun, show you do not want to hurt them.

457
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:24,499
We were wrong.

458
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:28,707
Gruner, we were wrong.

459
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:38,165
Go inside.

460
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,082
I've said in!

461
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:53,999
Do not leave Me.

462
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:58,540
Nobody leaves. Nobody leaves.

463
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,999
I am leaving. Nobody leaves Gruner.

464
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:04,249
Dont leave me,

465
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:07,999
do not let me, let me ... no.

466
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:11,040
Nobody leaves Gruner.

467
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,790
Gruner leaves, Gruner leaves.

468
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,749
Gruner leaves.

469
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:20,415
Nobody leaves Gruner, no. Gruner leaves.

470
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:25,415
No one Gruner Stop! Gruner leaves.

471
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:17,083
Wait.

472
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,590
¡Gruner!

473
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:24,165
Aldor Vigeland, is not a murderer!

474
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:52,291
Love,

475
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:57,742
love,

476
01:35:01,686 --> 01:35:02,839
love...

477
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,999
Sr. Gruner.

478
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:11,290
Gruner technician maritime signals.

479
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,457
Come on, get up!

480
01:37:26,916 --> 01:37:30,499
We have come to relieve the meteorologist with him.

481
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:32,457
You know where he is?

482
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:36,750
I talked!

483
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:41,666
Typhus.

484
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:46,707
This place is a pigsty.

485
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,415
¡Mírese!

486
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:52,624
It is not able to continue their work, we're at war.

487
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,832
Come here!

488
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:02,457
I think the poor are sick by isolation, sir.

489
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,457
- You know the saying, nobody is ... - We'll take care of it.

490
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,540
Register yourself the island!
