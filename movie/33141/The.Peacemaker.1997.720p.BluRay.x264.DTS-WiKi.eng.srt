1
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:20,292
- Da?
- Da.

2
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,559
What happened?

3
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:21,653
I don't know, Dr. Kelly.
Please come with me, ma'am.

4
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,500
[Man] I've got estimates on
cloud size comin' through on line six.

5
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:32,837
- What've we got?
- NORAD's got R4 going over sector 9877.

6
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,536
It's been localized.
Sixty degrees longitude, fifty lat.

7
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:38,876
- What about N.P.I.C.?
- Ground blast 40 minutes ago
in the Ural Mountains.

8
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,815
Two trains collided.
One was carrying warheads to Cherbynsk.

9
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:43,818
- Nice hair. Very au naturel.
- Jesus.

10
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:46,650
Nuclear forces are going from
DEFCON four to DEFCON three.

11
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,656
Secured faxes comin' in now.

12
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:51,158
N.M.C.C.'s concerned the Russians
are gonna use this incident...

13
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,491
to veil troop movements
into Chechnya and Georgia.

14
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:56,497
That's not our problem.
Estimates from Livermore?

15
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:59,693
Five to seven hundred kilotons.

16
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,498
Mark Appleton's looking for you.
He's upstairs.

17
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:05,267
- All current data on my desk?
- Yes.

18
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:09,141
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- Radiation pattern projections in?

19
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,839
- Yeah, but those aren't confirmed.
- Get them confirmed.

20
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:15,680
[Man] Russia. What a fucking mess.
God, I miss the Cold War.

21
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:18,379
Get Essler down here now.
I need a translator.

22
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:20,854
Essler's gone.
He quit to run J.P.L.

23
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:23,790
- Who did we appoint?
- My memo's sitting on your desk.

24
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:27,158
- Who the hell's in charge down there?
- [Kelly] Mark?

25
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,629
Mark?
Excuse me.

26
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:34,135
Sorry. Forget Chernobyl.
This is- - This is huge.

27
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,728
Dr. Julia Kelly,
Acting Chair, Nuclear Smuggling Group.

28
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:40,070
- You know Terry Hamilton,
National Security Advisor.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:43,373
- We met at last year's Christmas party.
- I'm briefing the president.

30
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:45,879
I need to explain how,
with our own START team there,

31
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,212
a goddamn accident
like this could happen.

32
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,445
It wasn't
an accident, sir.

33
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,544
I'm sorry?

34
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:54,555
We believe that train was
carrying SS18s.

35
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:57,922
- SS18s pencil out at One Point Safe.
- What's she saying?

36
00:18:57,993 --> 00:19:00,427
It means if you fire a bullet
directly into the warhead,

37
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:03,056
there's less than a one- in- a- million
chance of the bomb going off.

38
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,532
The warhead has to be ignited
by its own nuclear trigger.

39
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:09,298
Would you hold this, please?
Here we have the satellite imagery.

40
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:12,670
This is the two trains approaching,
and here's the collision itself.

41
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,232
Now check out
the field of regard.

42
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:19,145
These two shots are at the same height
because they occurred at the same time.

43
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:21,478
Look at the blast.
It's two degrees higher,

44
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,984
after the satellites passed over.

45
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,645
Elapsed time
between shots?

46
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:29,179
Between the train wreck
and the detonation, 4 minutes.

47
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:33,695
Somebody set that nuclear weapon off.
This was a terrorist act.

48
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:36,560
Full N.S.C. Briefing
at 9:00 a.m.

49
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:40,193
The Russians' accident story will stand
for now. No leaks to the press.

50
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,703
Nobody shows up on Nightline.
Doctor- -?

51
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,705
Kelly.

52
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:47,970
I'm putting your group on point
until I find a replacement.

53
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:50,841
Yes, sir.
Oh.

54
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:54,542
Get me the latest satellite overviews,
and keep the updates coming.

55
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:03,419
Okay, uh, State, we're gonna need
talking points for the president.

56
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:07,258
We're also gonna need to know anybody
that might want to detonate a nuke
on Russian soil.

57
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:09,524
General, I'm gonna need
a military liaison...

58
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:11,532
with intel background
and Russian contacts.

59
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,864
- You've got it.
- Oh, and, General,

60
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:17,030
make sure he's willing
to take orders from a woman.

61
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:19,973
[Woman] Colonel Devoe,
let's deal with the events of May 18.

62
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,443
You were arrested
in a bar brawl...

63
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,447
in a Moscow disco
called Night Crawler?

64
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,610
Yes, ma'am,
that's correct.

65
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:32,153
And you were in the company
of a prostitute...

66
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,122
and a Russian
army colonel named...

67
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,351
Dimitri Vertikoff?

68
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:39,360
Yes, ma'am,
that is also correct.

69
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:42,329
Dimitri and I went into this bar
to try and buy some nerve gas...

70
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:45,458
off this ex- K.G.B. Guy
that we had heard...

71
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:49,834
was selling black market
surplus munitions to Iraq.

72
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:53,068
The fight started because, well,
we'd run up a bit of a bar tab- -

73
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:56,373
I believe the exact
amount was $5,200?

74
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:59,846
Mm- hmm. Well, we had dinner,
and I bought a couple of rounds.

75
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:02,748
Uh, Colonel Vertikoff
identified the K.G.B. Guy,

76
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:06,652
and we were able to stop the nerve gas
from getting to Iraq.

77
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,917
So how do you repay
a man like that?

78
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,358
- Sports utility vehicle?
- That's exactly right.

79
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:15,226
Dimitri has a teenage daughter.
She likes to go four- wheeling.

80
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:18,994
I know this Ford guy in Maryland who cut
me a great deal on these Explorers.

81
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,503
- I like the Bronco better myself.
- Colonel, let me get this straight.

82
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:26,837
You spent taxpayers' money
to buy and ship...

83
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:29,901
a Ford Explorer
8,000 miles...

84
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:33,175
to the teenage daughter
of a Russian colonel?

85
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,182
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:39,913
Think of it as
exporting goodwill.

87
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,251
[Men Chattering In Russian]

88
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:47,020
Your Russian is awful.
Speak English.

89
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,683
- [Speaking Russian]
- It was stupid, understand?

90
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:52,693
Your friends made this deal,
but this is my operation.

91
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:55,821
Don't make me start thinking
of why I don't need you.

92
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:58,765
- They will never let us through.
- Of course they will.

93
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:02,429
Section 21- A,
Nuclear Disaster Protocol.

94
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:05,302
One, secure area.
Two, control debris.

95
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,241
Three,
evacuate casualties.

96
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,244
[Speaking Russian]

97
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,774
[Chuckles]
Huh?

98
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:20,955
[Kelly] But they would have
the technical knowhow...

99
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,957
and should not be ruled out.

100
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:27,155
And moving on, we come to
Shamil Basayev, a scientist.

101
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,254
He claims responsibility
for having placed...

102
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:33,597
a canister of radioactive cesium
in a park in Moscow last June,

103
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:38,129
but his underworld ties suggest he could
be part of a much bigger operation.

104
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:41,004
Uh,

105
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,374
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev,

106
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,970
Chechen leader since the
Russians assassinated Dudayev.

107
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:49,950
He has threatened to attack
Federation nuclear power plants.

108
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,646
There are other possibles on
our terrorist list,

109
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:55,713
as outlined in section 4
of your packet.

110
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,816
Our reaction to the crisis
is as follows.

111
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,884
We have initiated
an intelligence directive...

112
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:01,896
with the Nuclear Smuggling
Group acting as hub.

113
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:06,094
D.I.A. And N.R.O., heads up.
You'll continue responsibility
for primary SAT imagery- -

114
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:09,103
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt.

115
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,935
- Yes?
- Um, these terrorists,

116
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,567
have they asked for anything,
a list of demands?

117
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:16,668
Russians out of Chechnya?
That sort of thing?

118
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:20,272
No, but it's not unusual
for days, even weeks to go by...

119
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:22,613
before a claim
of responsibility is made.

120
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:24,743
- Yeah.
- Air mob command- -

121
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,482
Uh, excuse me again, ma'am.
I'm sorry.

122
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:32,289
Uh, that's a satellite shot of the two
trains just before they collided.

123
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:35,626
Dr. Kelly, perhaps you should discuss
Special Op possibilities?

124
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:38,860
Right. General Garnett has Special
Operations command at full alert.

125
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,834
Excuse me.

126
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:43,427
Excuse me. I'm sorry
to keep interrupting.

127
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:46,201
You see these blobs right here
at one- meter resolution?

128
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:51,075
Those are people jumping off
the passenger train before it crashes.

129
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:54,138
Now take a look at that train.
That's the one with the nuke.

130
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:59,778
Nobody's jumpin' off that.
Why not?

131
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:05,759
They were already dead.

132
00:25:05,827 --> 00:25:09,558
[Man]
How many warheads were on that train?

133
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:12,964
- The Russians haven't confirmed.
- So we have no idea of potential yield.

134
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:20,307
Are you suggesting
this was a robbery?

135
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,468
I'm suggesting that
whoever did this...

136
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:24,535
had access to Russian satellite
positioning intel.

137
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:27,081
That leaves out
your Chechen rebels.

138
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:28,810
[Murmuring]

139
00:25:28,884 --> 00:25:31,011
I would like
to point out...

140
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:34,681
that 1,500 people
were killed last night.

141
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:38,283
You don't do that unless you're trying
to make a very profound statement.

142
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,261
Do you know how much a functioning nuke
is worth on the open market?

143
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:43,490
Minimum $200 million, cash.

144
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:46,329
$200 million makes for
a very profound statement.

145
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:49,598
Now, I'm sorry, ma'am.
The detonation was a smoke screen.

146
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:52,105
This was a hijacking, and whoever
stole these things...

147
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:55,337
got off the bus
a long way back.

148
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,503
[Murmuring]

149
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:02,443
Well, we will certainly be
considering your theory.

150
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,451
Thank you very much.

151
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,044
Well, it's just an opinion.

152
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:12,558
Whoever has current data on the blast,
I need it on my desk A.S.A.P.

You got it.

- Anything on D.I.A.?

159
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:07,610
- We should have Russian intel
within the half hour.
- Great.

Sue, I need the START observers' report.
Not just the summaries.

Well, we need to know
exactly who was on that train.

There were ten warheads on that train.

00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:54,355
in Russia's Ural Mountains
is still sketchy at this hour,

260
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:58,559
but we do have a few new facts
about the magnitude of the disaster.

261
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:02,091
Seismographs around the world
detected the blast,

262
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,901
and we have reports that the explosion
was seen as far away as Lithuania...

263
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:07,999
on the Baltic Sea.

the nuclear fallout...

- Kordech.
- Maybe.

271
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:31,025
Kordech is a front for
the Russian mafia in Vienna.

272
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,158
And it's
a trucking company.

00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:38,171
Whether it was an accident
or a deliberate act of terrorism
remains a question.

and troop movements
from NATO humint.

Honey- roasted. Think anybody'll mind
if I stole a couple of bags?

278
00:33:58,226 --> 00:34:00,820
My old man will get a kick
out of the Executive Seal.

279

Go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

Would you call Langley?
We're still waiting on the
psych profile on Kodoroff.

281
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:08,935
He's an asshole.
I'll save you a trip.

282
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,494
Thanks. I'll settle for
the official version.

283
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:14,007
Okay. Officially,
he's an asshole.

284
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:16,703
He'll do anything for money,
which is the good news,

285
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:19,008
'cause it makes him
fairly predictable.

286
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,674
I'd say he's been
anything but predictable.

287
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:25,708
He took an order for an
expensive, hard- to- find product,

288
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:27,778
and he intends to
make good on delivery.

289
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:30,255
Supply and demand.

290
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:33,488
Your area of expertise,
right, Colonel?

291
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:36,587
At least, that's
the word on the Hill.

292
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,260
You've been
checkin' up on me.

293

who I'm working with.

294

I'd like
to know something.

295
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:55,613
You moved from Lawrence Livermore
to the White House.

296
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:59,915
So, first you build the bombs
to blow up the entire world...

297
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:02,650
and now you wanna
save it.

298
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:04,817
Make up your mind.

It is to me,
that simple.

302
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:19,432
And when you've been the boss for more
than two weeks, you'll know that.

Three weeks.
You've done some checkin' yourself.

Well, I like to know
who I'm workin' with.

305
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:33,214
Doctor, you can run your charts
and your theories all you want.

In the field,
this is how it works.

They are, however,
all alike.

and they're willing to pay
top dollar to get it.

And that is our
highly motivated buyer.

- What about other motivations?
- Not important to me.

313
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,334
Whether it's important to you or not,
there are people out there...

314
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,538
who don't care about money
and don't give a damn about respect,

315
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:01,275
people who believe the killing of
innocent men and women is justified.

316
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,683
For them it is about rage,
frustration, hatred.

317
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:08,051
They feel pain, and they're
determined to share it.

Twenty- three hours ago,

321
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:19,725
He's just a delivery boy.

I'm not afraid of the man who wants
ten nuclear weapons, Colonel.

01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:25,718
- No, wait. Wait. Colonel.
- Santiago!

605
01:04:25,785 --> 01:04:27,719
With Russia insisting they're
handling this,

606
01:04:27,787 --> 01:04:29,755
you will not take action
without authorization.

607
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:32,518
What do you think I am, some
gung- ho stupid son of a bitch?

608
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:34,560
No, I don't think you're stupid.

609
01:04:34,627 --> 01:04:37,323
I think you're a talented soldier
with sloppy impulse control,

610
01:04:37,397 --> 01:04:40,855
and I don't want you provoking
an international incident
because of a personal agenda.

611
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:43,902
My personal agenda
is my business.

612
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,234
Now you are not
in Washington anymore.

613
01:04:46,305 --> 01:04:48,239
You are in the real world.
In the real world,

614
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:50,707
there are nuclear arms
heading for Iran.

615
01:04:50,777 --> 01:04:54,042
So whether you agree with me
or not, get me authorized!

616
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:34,151
[Speaking Serbian]

617
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:00,975
Cobra Three, this is Tango Six.
What have we got?

618
01:06:01,047 --> 01:06:04,414
[Kelly] Russian command
has been notified of
the target vehicle's location.

619
01:06:04,484 --> 01:06:07,078
Proceed to position
and await further instructions.

620
01:06:07,153 --> 01:06:10,782
- Ken, does N.R.O. Have
anything up there for us?
- They got us on standby.

621
01:06:10,857 --> 01:06:12,825
Take this down.
How much time are we looking at?

622
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:14,883
We can track 'em for another
45 minutes.

623
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:16,895
Let's alert IFOR
at the Bazta checkpoint.

624
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:18,931
They'll have to pass
through there.

625
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:35,180
Put that away.

626
01:06:36,382 --> 01:06:38,316

[Speaking Russian]

628
01:07:52,658 --> 01:07:54,592
Stop.

629
01:07:56,462 --> 01:08:00,023
[Soldier Speaking Russian]

630
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:24,454
[Reporter] There's been a tragic
setback in the ongoing effort...

631
01:08:24,523 --> 01:08:27,856
to secure lasting peace
in the former Yugoslavia.

632
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:30,327
So far, no one
has taken responsibility...

633
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:34,526
for the killing of the Bosnian- Serb
finance minister, Zarko Preljevich,

634
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,592
who was assassinated
in a Sarajevo churchyard.

635
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,968
Word of Preljevich's
violent death...

636
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:43,133
has sent shock waves through
the international community.

637
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:45,939
The well- liked moderate
was considered a crucial player...

638
01:08:46,012 --> 01:08:49,914
in the upcoming peace talke scheduled
to begin this week in New York.

639
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:54,817
Reporting live from Sarajevo,
this is Jean Rogers for CNN.

640
01:08:56,656 --> 01:08:58,783
Forty- four "E."

641
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:03,556
Forty- fourth parallel
runs through...

642
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,767
Sarajevo.

643
01:09:12,271 --> 01:09:15,468
Where's that bank routing number?
The one off the Kordech invoice?

644
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:18,476
- You better get over here.
- Check it against banks in Sarajevo.

645
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:21,035
- What's going on?
- A Russian roadblock.

646
01:09:21,113 --> 01:09:23,047
They're all dead, ma'am.

647
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,345
I think
they're all dead.

648
01:09:25,418 --> 01:09:28,251
[Devoe]
Cobra Three, they got 'em?

649
01:09:28,587 --> 01:09:31,385
Negative, Tango Six. How much longer
do we have them on satellite?

650
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:33,391
Less than ten minutes.

651
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:35,393
Alert the Russians
of the truck's current position.

652
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:37,429
Tell them they have
men down out there.

653
01:09:37,496 --> 01:09:41,364
Wallace, stand by to track
if they go to Bravo.

654
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:45,700
[Devoe] We've now reached
the Federation airspace, Cobra Three.

655
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:48,968
Running out of time.
Suggest we go.

656
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:51,942
Negative, Six.
Do not proceed without authorization.

657
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:54,502
- Do the Russians have
troops in the area?
- Negative.

658
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,140
[Devoe] Cobra Three, we're gonna
lose 'em on satellite. We have to go.

659
01:09:57,216 --> 01:10:00,117
Get me a secure phone link
to N.M.C.C. Negative, Six.

660
01:10:00,186 --> 01:10:03,986
Do not proceed without authorization.
You will not proceed.

661
01:10:08,227 --> 01:10:10,889
When we lose the satellite,
do we have other eyes in the area?

662
01:10:10,963 --> 01:10:15,093
[Kelly] Sir, we have the target
vehicle approaching the Iranian border.

663
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,659
Requesting permission to enter Russian
Federation airspace and take it out.

664
01:10:18,738 --> 01:10:22,606
Dr. Kelly, in your estimation, is this
our only remaining course of action?

665
01:10:22,675 --> 01:10:25,439
Based on available intel, the Russians
having no forces in place,

666
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:27,775
our analysis of
the satellite sigint- -

667
01:10:27,847 --> 01:10:33,114
I'm not asking for analysis, Dr. Kelly.
I'm asking for a decision.

668
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:37,554
- Must advise we go, sir.
- Dr. Kelly, if there are
nuclear weapons on that truck,

669
01:10:37,623 --> 01:10:40,114
and the Russians
can't interdict,

670
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:44,026
are you willing to risk a war
to stop it?

671
01:10:47,099 --> 01:10:49,090
Yes, sir.

672
01:10:49,168 --> 01:10:51,363
Yes, sir, I am.

673
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:54,565
Six, this is Cobra Three.
We have a go.

674
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,006
Avoid foreign casualties.
Secure the target vehicle.

675
01:10:57,076 --> 01:10:59,306
Detain anyone found inside.

676
01:10:59,378 --> 01:11:03,974
Copy, Cobra. Six to task force.
We're cleared as briefed.
Let's rock and roll!

This is Red Dog Pack to Three.
Execute. Execute.

01:11:26,305 --> 01:11:28,330

back there?

Russian control tower,
this is Air Force 53762,

682
01:12:10,115 --> 01:12:15,610
a flight of three U.S. Air Force
helicopters in pursuit
of stolen nuclear weapons.

683
01:12:15,688 --> 01:12:17,679
Request a weapons- hold status.

[Speaking Russian]

685
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:37,201
You must return to Turkish airspace,
U.S. Air Force.

686
01:12:37,276 --> 01:12:40,837
Your intrusion is not authorized.
You have crossed international line.

687
01:12:46,418 --> 01:12:48,909
They've locked onto us.

688
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:52,216
A second battery's
locked onto us.

689
01:12:57,463 --> 01:13:02,730
This is Air Force 53762. We are
in pursuit of stolen nuclear weapons...

690
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:04,996
on their way to Iran.

691
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:08,267
Repeat: Put your weapons
on hold.

692
01:13:12,678 --> 01:13:15,943
Reverse course immediately,
or we will begin to fire.

01:13:16,015 --> 01:13:18,848
This is Red Dog Three.
We're lit up like a Christmas tree.

694
01:13:18,918 --> 01:13:22,012
This is Air Force 53762.

695
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:24,521
Those weapons could be going to
Chechnya or Georgia.

696
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:26,854
We repeat:
Put your weapons on hold!

[Devoe] Number One is down.
Cobra, we have a downed aircraft...

700
01:13:56,455 --> 01:13:58,389
two miles east
of checkpoint four.

701
01:13:58,457 --> 01:14:01,824
- Number Three, acknowledge.
- This is Red Dog Three.

702
01:14:01,894 --> 01:14:04,385
Do you see the aircraft?
Do you see any survivors?

703
01:14:04,463 --> 01:14:07,193
Negative. The whole fucking forest
is up in flames.

704
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:11,327
Number Three, duck behind the hill.
Behind the hill.

705
01:14:15,074 --> 01:14:18,066
- How many men on that chopper?
- Nine.

Here it is.

709
01:14:54,013 --> 01:14:57,642
What's he doing?

710
01:14:57,716 --> 01:15:01,618
- Will it work?
- It can be activated by a single man...

711
01:15:01,687 --> 01:15:05,418
and will render a nuclear yield
of one to two kilotons.

712
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:07,982
- Why is he doing that now?
- Because that was the deal.

713
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,824
One warhead for us, to do
with as we wish.

- Yeah. Open 'em up. Let's go!

[Devoe] Give me the radio.
Cobra Three, are you there?

739
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:35,846
Six, what happened?

740
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:39,721
One assault aircraft is gone.
Nine men are dead.

741
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:43,056
- Santiago!
- Kodoroff is dead, and we have
recovered...

742
01:20:43,128 --> 01:20:45,153
- eight nuclear warheads...
- Someone's holding on over the side!

743
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:47,824
- In their containers.
- That's not enough warheads.

744
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:51,630
- What?
- [Kelly]
That's not enough damn warheads.

745
01:20:51,703 --> 01:20:55,298
- For once, you could
say something nice.
- It was an SS18- - ten warheads.

746
01:20:55,374 --> 01:20:58,707
One detonated, eight with you.
That leaves one unaccounted for.

Colonel Devoe! There's
somebody alive down here!

01:21:02,114 --> 01:21:05,880
Hold on a minute.
Take this. Motherfuck.

- Do you speak English?
- Yes, l- - I went to Harvard.

Go, Crimson!
Help me up, please.

- Where's the other warhead?
- Please, bring me up.

754
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:31,232
Listen to me very carefully.
You are gonna die unless you
tell me where the warhead is.

01:21:31,309 --> 01:21:34,176
- I don't know. He took it. He's gone.
- Who?

756
01:21:34,246 --> 01:21:37,738
I don't know his name! He's, uh,
with the ones who arranged this!

757
01:21:37,816 --> 01:21:40,910
- Kodoroff?
- No, Kodoroff just handled the money!

758
01:21:40,986 --> 01:21:42,920
It was the other one!

759
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:47,084
He- He made me dismantle
the primary, make it mobile.

760
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:52,358
- How?
- It's in his backpack.
Help me up, please?

761
01:22:04,443 --> 01:22:06,570
- I'm goin' back to the rig.
- Help me up.

762
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:09,170
- Just hang on. We'll bring you up.
- Okay.

All right, come on back.

765
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:31,295
We got it. The bank account
on the Kordech invoice?

766
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:35,100
Registered to an address in Grbavica,
a Serbian suburb of Sarajevo.

767
01:22:35,173 --> 01:22:40,042
Good. Get this information to IFOR.
Tell them to proceed with caution.

768
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:54,952

- Are you all right?
- I've been better. How 'bout you?

775
01:24:58,783 --> 01:25:03,914
I've been better. We traced the money
back to a man named Vlado Mirich.

776
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:07,481
IFOR found a tape in his apartment.
They're uplinking it to us now.

777
01:25:07,559 --> 01:25:10,255
They say it has some sort
of terrorist message on it.

778
01:25:10,328 --> 01:25:12,694
Colonel, the guy you caught
is Dr. Amir Taraki.

779
01:25:12,764 --> 01:25:16,928
Pakistani. Ph.D. In astrophysics.
Educated at Harvard.

780
01:25:17,002 --> 01:25:20,165
That's right. We educated
half the world's terrorists.

781
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:22,399
- You need to tell me
exactly what he said.
- All right.

782
01:25:22,474 --> 01:25:25,568
He removed the primary from the warhead,
and he put it in a backpack.

783
01:25:25,644 --> 01:25:27,578
The primary is packed
with plutonium.

784
01:25:27,646 --> 01:25:30,479
Detonated, it could still
take out ten city blocks...

785
01:25:30,548 --> 01:25:32,812
- IFOR tape is transmitting!
- And kill 100,000 people...

786
01:25:32,884 --> 01:25:35,375
in a densely populated area
like Sarajevo or Tuzla.

787
01:25:35,453 --> 01:25:39,219
[Mirich] You will look at what
I have done and say,

788
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,225
"Of course. Why not?

789
01:25:41,293 --> 01:25:43,818
"They are all animals.

790
01:25:43,895 --> 01:25:46,489
They have slaughtered
each other for centuries."

791
01:25:47,866 --> 01:25:50,266
But the truth is...

792
01:25:50,335 --> 01:25:52,326
I'm not a monster.

793
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:55,862
I'm a human man.
I'm just like you...

794
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,999
whether you like it
or not.

795
01:25:58,076 --> 01:26:02,410
For years, we have tried
to live together...

796
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,040
until a war
was waged on us.

797
01:26:06,217 --> 01:26:08,208
On all of us.

798
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:12,279
A war waged by
our own leaders.

[Mirich On Videotape, Continuing]
And who supplied...

800
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:16,990
the Serb cluster bombs,

801
01:26:17,062 --> 01:26:19,030
the Croatian tanks,

802
01:26:19,097 --> 01:26:22,032
the Muslim artillery shells...

803
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,796
that killed
our sons and daughters?

804
01:26:24,869 --> 01:26:30,535
It was the governments of the West who
drew the boundaries of our countries- -

805
01:26:30,608 --> 01:26:33,975
sometimes in ink,
sometimes in blood- -

806
01:26:34,045 --> 01:26:36,275
the blood of our people,

807
01:26:36,348 --> 01:26:39,340
and now, you dispatch
your peacekeepers...

808
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:43,478
to write
our destiny again.

809
01:26:43,555 --> 01:26:46,649
We can never accept this peace
that leaves us...

810
01:26:46,725 --> 01:26:49,353
with nothing but pain- -

811
01:26:49,427 --> 01:26:54,194
pain the peacemakers
must be made to feel.

812

their houses

814
01:27:00,138 --> 01:27:04,131
So now you know.
Now you must understand.

815
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:10,011
Leave us to find
our own destiny.

816
01:27:10,081 --> 01:27:13,744

- He's never gonna get into Tuzla.
- He's not going there.

We weren't meant to find this until
after he had detonated the bomb.

Now, "pain the peacemakers
must be made to feel."

The peacemakers aren't in Bosnia.
They're in Europe and the U.S.

822

- They're signing a new treaty

- Tomorrow at the U.N.

We're running

858
01:31:28,339 --> 01:31:31,797
Initial blast would throw 60 rads
of prompt radiation out three miles.
