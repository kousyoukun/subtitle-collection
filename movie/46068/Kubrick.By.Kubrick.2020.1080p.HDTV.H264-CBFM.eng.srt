1
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,685
突发新闻 刚刚得到消息 电影导演
News just in, we've just heard
that the film director

2
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:25,165
斯坦利库布里克去世 享年70岁
Stanley Kubrick
has died at the age of 70.

3
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,565
库布里克是美国人 在导演过<斯巴达克斯>的好莱坞
Kubrick, who was an American,
began his career in Hollywood

4
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,125
开启了他的事业 但后来决定搬去英国
where he directed Spartacus
but he decided to move to Britain

5
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:35,045
在那里他导演过<洛丽塔> <发条橙>
where he directed Lolita,
Clockwork Orange,

6
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:38,365
<2001太空漫游><闪灵>
2001: A Space Odyssey
and The Shining.

7
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,525
斯坦利库布里克被广泛认为是
Stanley Kubrick was widely regarded

8
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:44,845
最伟大也最有争议的电影大师之一
as one of the greatest and most
controversial masters of cinema.

9
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,405
他刚刚完成了他的最后一部电影 <大开眼戒>
He just finished what was to be
his last film, Eyes Wide Shut

10
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,685
耗时长达五年
which took five years to make.

11
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,405
斯坦利库布里克被称作电影界的霍华德休斯
Stanley Kubrick has been called
the Howard Hughes of cinema

12
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,485
因为他完全是一个隐居者
because he was such a recluse.

13
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:58,765
我倒更愿意称他为电影界的法兰克辛纳屈
I prefer to think of him
as the Frank Sinatra of cinema

14
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:00,645
因为他做什么都按照自己的方式
because he always did
everything his way.

15
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:04,645
你可以回到任何一部库布里克的电影中感受重生
You can back to any Kubrick film
and feel rebirth.

16
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,325
库布里克至少是一位名副其实的创新者
Kubrick is at the very least
a genuine innovator

17
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:30,885
他将电影的边界推向了极致
who pushes out the boundaries
of what is possible on film

18
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,205
而这样的人从来都没有多少个
and there have never been
too many of those about.

19
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:35,005
他也是一位神出鬼没的人
He is also an elusive man

20
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,165
很少允许自己在工作中被人观察
who rarely permits himself
to be observed at work.

21
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:41,525
他和报纸上描述的完全不一样
He was not any of the things
that the newspapers wrote about him.

22
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:48,045
而他本人也说过 这很难 我要如何为自己辩护
And he himself said, "It's very
difficult. How do I defend myself?

23
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:51,565
是自己写篇文章说 亲爱的公众们 我很迷人吗
"Do I write an article, you know,
'Dear public, I'm charming'?"

24
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,685
这其实要比听上去难得多
That's more difficult
than it sounds, actually.

25
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,845
因为 你知道 他从来不上电视
'Cause, you know, he never ever
does a television,

26
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:59,645
也很少接受媒体采访
or very rarely
does any press interviews.

27
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,485
那么 大概第一个问题
CIMENT: Well,
perhaps the first question

28
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,405
是关于采访本身的
would be about
this problem of interview

29
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,445
因为你似乎越来越
because it seems that more and more

30
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:27,245
不愿意谈起自己的电影了
you feel reluctant
to speak about your films?

31
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:30,765
嗯 我从来都没觉得从自己的电影中
KUBRICK: Well,
I've never found it meaningful

32
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:37,125
谈论美学是有意义
or even possible
to talk about film aesthetics

33
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,605
或者有可能的
in terms of my own films.

34
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:43,605
我也不特别喜欢采访本身
I also don't particularly enjoy
the interviews

35
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,205
因为人们总觉得有必要
because one always
feels under the obligation

36
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:51,765
对电影的意图做出一些诙谐又精彩的总结
to say some witty, brilliant summary
of the intentions of the films.

37
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,645
像<奇爱博士>
And with Dr. Strangelove

38
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:56,565
你就可以谈论核武器战争的问题
you could talk about
the problems of Nuclear War,

39
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:59,645
<2001太空漫游>则是讨论外太空智慧
2001 you could talk
about extraterrestrial intelligence,

40
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,405
但我从来都不能够
but I've never been able...

41
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:05,165
<发条橙>是关于暴力 对 或者是关于未来 社会结构
Clockwork Orange about violence.
Yes, or future, social structures.

42
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:08,725
我是说 我拍的每一部电影都不知道是什么在让我拍
I mean, I don't know what led me
to make any of the films, really,

43
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:10,765
真的
that I made.

44
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:17,325
而且我意识到我自己的思维过程是很难定义的
And I realised that my own thought
processes are very hard to define,

45
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:21,805
当涉及到要把什么故事拍成电影的时候
in terms of, you know, what story
do you want to make into a film.

46
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:27,845
到最后 这就会变成很难定义的东西
In the end, you know, it does become
this very indefinable thing

47
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,885
好比你为什么觉得某个女孩有魅力
like why do you find
one particular girl attractive

48
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:32,885
或者你为什么和你老婆结婚
or why did you marry your wife.

49
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:38,765
好的 另外我猜对你来说自我分析更有难度
Yes, and also, I suppose
it is more difficult for you
to analyse yourself

50
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:41,485
是因为那些文本材料往往来自于他人
because the material
comes from somebody else.

51
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:46,245
因此 会更难看到电影背后的个人因素 因为它们不是出自你手
So, it's more difficult to see the
personal reasons that were behind it
since you didn't write it yourself.

52
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:50,165
但显然对于文本的选择也是非常个人化的事情
But obviously the choice of the
subject is a very personal thing,

53
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:53,245
因为你从千万本书中选出了一本
because you can choose from
thousands of books
and you choose one.

54
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:57,005
通过挑选出一本书 在某种程度上你也成为了作者
You become the author of the book
in a way by choosing it.

55
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:59,445
如果别人写了一个故事
Well, if somebody else
has written the story

56
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:03,765
你有了一个很棒的第一次阅读的过程
you have the one great first reading.

57
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:07,845
你就永远不会 在你读完第一次之后
You never again, once you read
something for the first time,

58
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:10,405
再次拥有那种体验了
can ever have that experience,

59
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:13,925
对于其叙事的判断 以及那种某段故事
and the judgement of the narrative
and the sense of excitement

60
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:17,685
让你为之动容的兴奋感
of what parts of the story
reach you emotionally,

61
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:21,565
是你自己写故事时体会不到的
is something which doesn't exist
if you write a story.

62
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,965
我们知道 我是说所有人都知道
We know, I mean, everybody knows,

63
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:31,605
你喜爱大量堆积信息查阅资料的习惯恶名远扬
it's notorious that you love to
accumulate information, do research.

64
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,685
我想问的是 这给你带来兴奋感吗
I mean, is it a thrill for you?

65
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,325
像做记者或者侦探的感觉
I mean, like being
a reporter or a detective?

66
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:40,605
找线索的过程是有一点像侦探
It is a little bit like
a detective looking for clues.

67
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:47,005
在拍<巴里林登>时 我创建了一个
On Barry Lyndon,
I created a picture file

68
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:50,365
有上千幅绘画作品的图片文件夹
of thousands of drawings
and paintings.

69
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:55,805
我感觉自己差不多破坏了所有能在书店买到的艺术书籍
I think I've destroyed every art
book that you can buy in a bookshop

70
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,525
把书页撕下来 分类整理
by tearing the pages out,
sorting them out.

71
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:03,245
但服装造型全是模仿绘画里的
But the costumes were all copied
from paintings.

72
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:07,365
我是说 没有一件服装是 引号 设计出来的
I mean, none of the costumes were,
quote, "designed".

73
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:11,005
找一个所谓的设计师 
It's stupid to have a,
quote, a "designer"

74
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,565
让他们用在艺术学校学到的或从几张绘画中拼凑出的东西去诠释十八世纪
interpret the 18th century as they
may remember it from art school

75
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,725
是非常蠢的
or from a few pictures
they get together.

76
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,445
你同意虚构作品越多
Would you agree
that the more illusion works

77
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,685
就越真实的说法吗
the more realistic it is?

78
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:33,685
影像需要非常真实
The cinema has to be
extremely realistic, you know,

79
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,765
才能制造虚幻
to create illusion?

80
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,845
嗯 我总是被呈现出有趣的
Well, I would always be attracted
to something

81
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:41,205
视觉可能性的事物所吸引
which offered
interesting visual possibilities

82
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,805
但那肯定不是唯一原因
but that certainly wouldn't be
the only reason.

83
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,445
而且因为任何故事的部分要点
And, since part of the problem
of any story

84
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:50,165
就在于为了让你相信你所看到的
is to make you believe
what you are seeing,

85
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,965
那么当然营造一种现实主义的气氛
certainly getting
a realistic atmosphere,

86
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,445
尤其当它不基于现代时期的话
especially if it's not
a contemporary period,

87
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,805
是有必要作为起点的
is just necessary
as a starting point.

88
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:06,045
所以你有了用光 自然光拍摄的想法
It's why you came to this idea of
shooting with light, natural light.

89
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:09,045
这是一直以来非常困扰我的一件事
Well, that's something that
I've always been very bothered by

90
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:12,485
就是在古装电影中室内的灯光问题
in period films,
is the light on interiors.

91
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,125
它太假了
It's so false.

92
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:20,565
就摄影而言 <巴里林登>
WOMAN: It was very different
to any kind of other movies

93
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:25,365
和任何类型的电影都很不同 因为打光非常
as far as photography was concerned,
because the lightning was so...

94
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,085
你知道 很多是依靠烛光来拍摄的
You know, lot of it
was shot by candlelight,

95
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:33,725
还有很多是斯坦利库布里克自己找来的设备
a lot of it was shot with equipment
that Stanley Kubrick had found,

96
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:36,645
以前从来没有任何一个电影使用过
that had never been used
before on any other film.

97
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,085
所以那是一种很好的经历
So it was quite an experience
working with that.

98
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,605
同时它也相当高难度 因为很多时候
It was also quite difficult
because there were times

99
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,725
是你一寸都不敢移动的状态
when you just couldn't even move
a fraction of an inch.

100
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:51,925
有时则是大家坐在那里被照一整天
And there were days where we would
sit there and just be lit all day.

101
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,925
就是字面意义上的
You know, literally.

102
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,525
塞缪尔 我要出去透口气
Samuel, I'm going outside
for a breath of air.

103
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,725
好的 夫人 当然
Yes, my lady, of course.

104
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:14,245
了解灯光 镜头和构图
To know about lighting and lenses
and composition

105
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,525
一定对做电影导演是有帮助的
has to be a help as a movie director.

106
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:34,285
我记得拍<斯巴达克斯>的时候
I remember
when I was making Spartacus,

107
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:38,525
摄影师拉塞尔·麦蒂觉得
the cameraman, Russ Metty,
used to think it was very funny

108
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:41,005
我用取景器来选场景很可笑
that I used to pick set-ups
with a view finder,

109
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,045
他对我说 我们从这个角度拍
and he said to me, you know,
"We're shooting in that direction

110
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,885
这是个膝上镜头
"and it's a knee figure shoot

111
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,085
你就去和演员们排练一遍
"and just, you know,
go and rehearse with the actors

112
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,925
等回来拍的时候你就能有这个镜头
"and when you come back
we'll have the shot

113
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:51,485
这个布景和一切了
"and the set-up and everything."

114
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:57,605
他不能理解我为什么想要浪费时间在创作构图上
He couldn't understand why I wanted
to waste time making a composition.

115
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:04,085
显然 摄影给了我第一步
Certainly, photography gave me
the first step

116
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,085
真正尝试拍电影的机会
where I could
actually try to make a movie

117
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,685
因为如果没有这些 如果你完全不懂摄影
because without that, how could you
make a movie by yourself

118
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,885
你怎么能独立完成一部电影
if you didn't know anything
about photography?

119
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,285
你那会儿拍什么样的照片
What kind of photographs
were you doing?

120
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,725
你有一张非常著名的
I mean,
there is the famous photography

121
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,645
关于报摊小贩的照片
of the newspaper vendor and the...

122
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:24,165
使用自然光的新闻摄影
Photojournalism with natural light.

123
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,685
大部分是关于街头的 就像卡蒂埃-布列松那样
Mostly things of the street
like Cartier Bresson.

124
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,365
不幸的是 <视觉>总是在做专题报道
Well, unfortunately, because Look
always did feature stories,

125
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,885
主题总是很愚蠢
the subject matter
always tended to be idiotic.

126
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:39,845
他们会做这样的报道 运动员会比婴儿强壮吗
They would do a story like "Is an
athlete stronger than a baby?"

127
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,005
然后我就得去找别人
And I would have to go
and there'd be some guy

128
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,005
让他们不得不摆出和婴儿一样的姿势
that would have to try to get
in the same positions as a baby

129
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,685
诸如此类的
and things like that.

130
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,805
都是些愚蠢的专题故事
They were pretty stupid
feature stories

131
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:53,565
不过偶尔我也可以做一些人物报道
but occasionally I could do
a sort of personality story,

132
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:57,005
或者关于大学的报道之类的
or a story about something like
a university or something like that

133
00:10:57,165 --> 00:11:00,365
就有机会拍合理一些的照片
where you had a chance
to take some reasonable photographs.

134
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:03,645
你在视觉杂志待了四年吗
You were four years at Look?

135
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:07,165
对 大概四年 在我20岁左右时
Yes, about four years.
I was about 20.

136
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:18,245
这个森林和所有发生的事情都不存在于历史之中
VOICEOVER: This forest then and all
that happens now is outside history.

137
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:25,485
只有百年不变的恐惧 怀疑和死亡
Only the unchanging shapes of fear,
and doubt and death

138
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,725
来自我们的世界
are from our world.

139
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,005
你所看到的这些士兵
These soldiers that you see

140
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:34,165
他们保留了我们的语言和时代
keep our language and our time

141
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:38,045
但没有祖国 只有思想
but have no other country
but the mind.

142
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,365
一开始你拍了一部几乎是家庭电影的作品
You started by making
almost a home movie,

143
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:47,205
在23岁的时候 <恐惧与欲望> 关于一个巡逻队里的四个人
when you were 23, Fear and Desire,
about four men in a patrol.

144
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,325
这部作品的背后是什么
What was behind this project?

145
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:53,685
那是我自己写的一个非常傲慢 轻率的剧本
That was a very arrogant, flippant
script put together by myself,

146
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,085
和一个我认识的诗人男孩
and a boy that I knew who was a poet,

147
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:58,365
那会儿我们都觉得自己是天才
where we thought
that we were geniuses,

148
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:03,405
那部电影的完成度极其地低
and it was so incompetently done

149
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:07,205
平淡无奇又极其浮夸
and undramatic, and so pompous.

150
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,805
但我也从中学到了东西
But I learned a lesson from that.

151
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,125
(GUNSHOTS)

152
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:15,445
至少它有一些野心 有一些想法在里头
At least it had the ambition
of having some ideas in it

153
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,165
我觉得你可以说从这个层面上
and I suppose you could say
in that sense

154
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:21,685
在我其他电影中还是体现了一丝连贯性
there's some continuity
with the rest of my films,

155
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:24,245
也就是我依然在确保
which I also tried to make sure

156
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:27,965
不仅只有空洞的娱在其中
that they weren't just
hollow entertainments.

157
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:50,245
(GUNSHOT)

158
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,165
在你的电影中会有一种感觉
You get the feeling from your films,

159
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:03,845
即真实的世界不只是一个舞台 更像是一场战争
that really the world
is not only a stage but it's a war

160
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:06,485
因为里面的人物一直在战斗
because man is fighting
all the time.

161
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:14,645
在一部小说里 你必须要有冲突
Well, in a work of fiction,
you have to have conflict.

162
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:16,685
如果一个故事里没有任何矛盾
If there isn't a problem in a story,

163
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:19,805
从定义上来看就几乎不能算是个故事
it can almost by definition
not be a story.

164
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,125
你要知道 有多少婚姻是幸福的呢
You know, how many happy marriages
are there?

165
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,365
又有多少继父爱他们的继子呢
And how many stepfathers
love their stepsons?

166
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,165
那么又有多少继子是爱他们的继父呢
And how many stepsons
love their stepfather?

167
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:36,285
那些雄心壮志
And how often do people

168
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:40,605
只关乎金钱的人 又会多少次地觉得
who have ambitions
which only involve money,

169
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:45,805
这是一种满足的成就呢
do they find it
a satisfying accomplishment?

170
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:48,365
巴里下士
Corporal Barry.

171
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,965
你是一名英勇的战士 显然出身名门
You are a gallant soldier and have
evidently come of good stock.

172
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,765
但是你懒惰 放荡 没有原则
But you're idle, dissolute
and unprincipled.

173
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,325
你对他们造成了很大的伤害
You've done a great deal of harm
to the men,

174
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:05,325
尽管你有才华和勇气 我相信你也不会有好下场
and for all your talents and bravery
I'm sure you will come to no good.

175
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:13,165
<巴里林登>讲述了一个爱尔兰冒险者的沉与浮
REVIEWER: Barry Lyndon
tells of the rise and fall

176
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:15,405
他也是一个无赖
of an Irish adventurer
and, let's face it, cad,

177
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:17,405
后来成为了士兵 逃兵 赌徒
who becomes a soldier,
a deserter, a gambler,

178
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,845
决斗者 最终成为了一个有钱寡妇的丈夫
a duellist and eventually
the husband of a very rich widow.

179
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,165
我认为 在观众和人物之间
There is, I think,
deliberately a distance

180
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,005
有一种刻意的距离
between the audience
and the characters.

181
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,965
你被要求观看他们的冒险与不幸
You are asked to watch the story of
their adventures and misadventures

182
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,125
但不一定要去认同他们
but not necessarily
to identify with them.

183
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:32,365
这是一种危险的尝试 但是很奏效
Well, that's a dangerous approach
but it works.

184
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,605
还很奏效的是电影悠闲的节奏
What also works
is the leisurely pace of the film,

185
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,605
这种节奏和小说节奏相符合
the pace that matches
the pace of the novel

186
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,445
而且我敢说也和18世纪的生活相匹配
and I daresay of 18th century life
itself.

187
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:41,645
所以如果你期待的是一个动作完整的游侠 还是算了吧
So if you're expecting an
all-action, swashbuckler, forget it.

188
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:44,485
库布里克传达出的则是一位长相英俊
What Kubrick presents instead
is a hard unromantic

189
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,685
却命途多舛的投机主义者 和他严肃的 不浪漫
and unsentimental look
at the life and times

190
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,205
也不伤感的生活和时代的样貌
of a good-looking
but ill-fated opportunist.

191
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,525
有一些人跳出电影之外然后说道
Some people get out of the movie
and said, you know,

192
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,765
这个人物 我们对他没有任何的同情心
"This character, we have absolutely
no sympathy for him."

193
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:59,205
好吧 我是想不出来为什么会对他毫不同情
Well, I can't see how you can have
no sympathy for him.

194
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,165
从另一个方面来说 我们都意识到了这个人物的脆弱性
On the other hand, we're well aware
of the weakness of his character

195
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:09,405
他出于个人野心而给自己设置的陷阱
and the trap that he places himself
in as a result of his ambitions,

196
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:12,245
以及他性格的局限性
and the limitation of his personality

197
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:16,205
来自于其日益增长的愤世嫉俗
that arises from
the cynicism which develops,

198
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:20,565
和早期与他人的关系
from his early relationships
with people.

199
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:25,405
他也就随之变成了一个很局限的人
He then becomes
a very limited person,

200
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,645
他完全不适应这种生活
he is completely unsuited
for the life,

201
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:33,645
不仅体现在社交上 在性情上也是如此
not only socially
but temperamentally.

202
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:37,245
于是他把自己关进一个镀金的笼子里
And so he puts himself
into a gilded cage.

203
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,925
从那之后 一切都腐坏了
And from then on
everything goes sour.

204
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:51,485
那你是怎么决定让瑞安奥尼尔做主角的
But how did you decide
on Ryan O'Neal for the main role?

205
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:54,445
我想不出还有其他任何人了 说实话
Well, I couldn't think of anybody
else, to tell you the truth.

206
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:58,845
我是说 显然巴里林登需要外观上很迷人
I mean, obviously, Barry Lyndon
has to be physically attractive.

207
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:03,125
不能由阿尔帕西诺或者杰克尼科尔森扮演
He couldn't be played
by Al Pacino or Jack Nicholson.

208
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,845
他也必须要 一开始
He had to also be able to,
in the beginning,

209
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:10,325
看起来很年轻 结尾时又不能还那么年轻
appear to be young and yet
not look too young at the end.

210
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,045
那演员呢 你是怎么指导演员的
And the actors,
how do you direct actors?

211
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,925
你和他们交流很多吗
Do you speak with them a lot?

212
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:21,045
还是说你让他们感受内容本身 你会讲解吗
Or do you let them more feel
the text or do you have explanation?

213
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:24,485
首先 要大概讨论一下角色
Well, first of all, you discuss
the character in general

214
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:27,245
然后讨论场景
and then you discuss the scene,

215
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:30,765
和角色在某个场景里的真实感受
what the character's real attitude
is in the scene.

216
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,445
然后就到了很可怕的环节
Then comes this terrible moment of

217
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:35,645
就是在你要拍摄的地方
the first time
that you actually rehearse a scene

218
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,765
首次实地排练一个场景
in the place
you're going to shoot it.

219
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:41,645
永远都有惊喜 永远和你想得会不一样
It's always a surprise. It's never
what you thought it would be.

220
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:46,045
剧本一般都会或多或少地改动
The text usually has to be changed
in some way or another.

221
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,365
然后就到了一个很现实又很有意思的阶段
Then they have to get it to a level
where it's realistic and interesting.

222
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:54,085
这个节点就变得相对轻松些
And at that point
it then becomes relatively easy.

223
00:16:57,085 --> 00:17:00,485
拍摄<发条橙>是一次绝妙的经历
MAN: It was an extraordinary
experience doing Clockwork Orange.

224
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,845
一部非常漫长又费力的电影
A very long and arduous film
to shoot.

225
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,085
花了七个月拍摄
It was seven months shooting.

226
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,725
期间我受了好几次伤
And I was injured
a couple of times on the film,

227
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,405
我的肋骨被压扁了
I had my ribs dented.

228
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,885
为此我休养了两个礼拜
I was off for two weeks with that.

229
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:17,405
我想我还得了扁桃体炎之类的
I think I had tonsillitis
or something I...

230
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,205
对我来说灾难接踵而至 对自己的健康产生了担忧
One disaster after another as far
as as I, my health was concerned.

231
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:24,245
我的眼角膜上也有几处划伤
I got a couple of scratched corneas
on my eyes.

232
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:27,485
但说了这么多 当然了
But having said all that, of course,

233
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,525
我想我还是会说这是值得的
I suppose one can say
it was worth it.

234
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,285
而且如果斯坦利信任你
And if Stanley trusts you,

235
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:34,405
如果他信任你 你就没事
if he trusts you, you're alright.

236
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,565
否则的话 就要小心了
If he doesn't, beware.

237
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:40,245
非常好 现在仔细听我说
Very well, now listen
to me carefully.

238
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,925
基地正处于红色警报状态
The base is being put
on condition red.

239
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,045
我希望它立即通知到所有部门
I want this flashed to all sections
immediately.

240
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:47,125
我经历了最差的一次拍电影体验
I had the worst time
I've ever had on a picture.

241
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:50,405
不过和斯坦利无关
And, nothing to do with Stanley.

242
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,765
我猜一切都是因为我自己的烦恼
And everything to do I guess
with my own hang-ups.

243
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,765
我第一天在谢伯顿制片厂开工
I worked the first day
at Shepperton.

244
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,965
我又有很多的技术术语台词 你知道的
And I had a great deal
of technical jargon, you know.

245
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,405
然后我就开始拍 开始说台词
And so I started to work
and I began to blow.

246
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,765
你知道外面这些小丑
You know those clowns outside

247
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,645
将在几分钟后好一顿折磨我
are gonna give me a pretty good
going over in a few minutes.

248
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:09,165
然后他拍了大概有38遍
OK, so he went something
like 38 takes.

249
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:12,245
我不知道自己能忍受何种程度的酷刑
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

250
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,405
我一次比一次差
And I was getting worse and worse.

251
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:16,965
最后 他开始拍短句
So finally, he began to do pick-ups.

252
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,245
一次拍一句
A sentence at a time.

253
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,645
我觉得这很痛苦 很尴尬
And I mean this is painful.
This is embarrassing.

254
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,725
你知道 我来到这是想把事情做好
You know, I'm here
and I want to do well.

255
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:27,045
我明白必须为自己的所作所为作出解释
I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

256
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:28,685
最后我走过去对他说
And finally I walked up and said,

257
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:31,525
抱歉 斯坦利 但我也只能做到这样了
"Stanley I'm sorry
but there is nothing I can do."

258
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,125
他说 我知道
He said, "I know that."

259
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:36,205
他说 你知道 我也不能再做更多了 我说 我知道
He said, "You know, there is nothing
I can do." I said, "I know that."

260
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,005
他说 不过我告诉你一件事
He said,
"But I'll tell you one thing,"

261
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,885
他说 那种恐惧 你眼中的恐惧
He said, "The terror,
the terror that's in your eyes

262
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:43,525
也许正好给了我们需要的质感
"may just give us
the quality that we want."

263
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,845
他是个完美主义者 不过是在一个更可被证明的层面
He is a perfectionist. But, I mean,
on a more provable level.

264
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:55,205
我是说 你知道拍电影的情况是不一样的
I mean, you know, it's different
in a movie situation

265
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:57,845
如果你问摄影师 刚那条怎么样
if you say, "How was it?"
to the operator.

266
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:01,685
斯坦利看得到监视器 所以他会知道
Stanley has the teleprompter
now, so he knows.

267
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:06,605
他有足够的理由来解释某一条为什么过不了
And the amount of reason that he has
why a take is not acceptable,

268
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:09,365
典型的完美主义
quintessentially perfectionist.

269
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,405

MAN: We had discussions about the
elusive quality of perfection

270
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:20,205
because down by take 75, a host
of other things start going wrong,

271
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:23,085
the tape finally gives out
that held something on to the wall.

272
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,725
Entropy takes over,
we're all growing older, you know.

273
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:30,605
The search is extraordinary,
he never gives up.

274
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,405
MAN: It was during a scene
of a great many army people,

275
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,685
or Irish army, whatever it was,

276
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,565
but we utilised a lot of material
that was absolutely authentic.

277
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:51,005
Authentic flutes from museums,
authentic drums

278
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,525
and so on and so forth.

279
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:54,445
And it was very easy.

280
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:57,445
I have, after all, recorded
some very avant-garde music

281
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:58,765
that's very difficult

282
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,205
and this was a cinch.

283
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,925
We did a 105 takes on this thing
and take two was perfect.

284
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:08,045
And the orchestra looked at me
and I looked at them,

285
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:10,725
as though, we're dealing
with an insane person.

286
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:14,925
And 105 takes, and finally
I threw down the baton,

287
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:16,965
ran into the thing,
and grabbed him by the neck.

288
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,045
I wanted to throw him
through the window

289
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:21,925
when everyone starting laughing,
kind of nervously.

290
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,565
And he said, "You're crazy."

291
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:27,525
And I said, "Well,
you've driven everybody crazy,
that's the problem."

292
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:36,765
Directing a movie, if you try to do
it properly, is not always fun

293
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:40,645
because you are in conflict
with people.

294
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:43,805
If you try to get it right
and you care about it,

295
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:46,325
it isn't something which
is the greatest fun in the world.

296
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,965
It's immensely satisfying,
sometimes,

297
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,765
but it is a lot of hard work

298
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:54,965
and there is a lot of personal
tension that occurs with everybody.

299
00:20:56,925 --> 00:21:03,005
The analogy would better in a sort
of military sense in that Napoleon,

300
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:04,805
if he didn't pay as much attention

301
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,525
to the precise details
of his marching,

302
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:12,085
how he brought his troops
to the right town on the right day,

303
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,085
he worked out all the calculations

304
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:16,045
where they would come
from different places,

305
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:21,285
and did all the mathematics himself,
and got them there at the right time.

306
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:25,085
He would never have an opportunity
to be a genius on the battlefield.

307
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:36,925
Battles were like
the equivalent of making a film.

308
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,885
MAN: The key to his success
as a filmmaker

309
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:47,565
is that he was the ruthless general
everyone wanted to march with.

310
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:50,285
He got everyone on his side
and no matter what happened

311
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:54,925
he expected his cast and crew
to keep up with his standard.

312
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,605
In a way, he kind of represented
something to all of us

313
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,925
because he was over there
on his estate in England,

314
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,685
he was far away from Hollywood,
he owns his own cameras,

315
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:04,925
his own editing equipment,
his own sound

316
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:08,005
and he worked entirely
accord to his own schedule.

317
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:09,845
It's kind of inspiring at a time

318
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:14,000
when everybody else seems to be
marching to the drums
of commerce and promotion.

319
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,160
Do you know what kind of camera
that is, what it's called?

320
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,760
It's a home movie.
Arriflex.

321
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,800
Napoleon is still in his grave,
waiting,

322
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,360
waiting to be brought back to life.

323
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,200
I wonder what Napoleon would think
of Lew Wasserman and David Picker,

324
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,480
whether he would've liked to have
them passing judgement on his life.

325
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,840
You worked in a disaffected plant?

326
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,960
Well, first thing I noticed

327
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,480
was that the architecture
in the peripheral areas

328
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,680
where the fighting seemed to be,

329
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,600
was this sort of 1930s
industrial functionalism,

330
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,440
and by the sheerest accident
we found this area

331
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
that is about a square mile,

332
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,880
and it was designed
by a German architect in the '30s,

333
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,720
and it looked exactly like
photographs we'd seen

334
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,560
in Hue and Saigon, the border...
the outskirts of the city.

335
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,760
And it just seemed like a miracle,

336
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,400
because, I don't know where,

337
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,640
looking back I don't know how
we would have done those scenes

338
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,960
with a tiny fraction of the reality

339
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
and interest that we got
from this location.

340
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,840
In Hue we could never have achieved
this vision of hell

341
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,880
that actually Hue looked like.

342
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,200
And I had done tremendous research,

343
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,000
I had thousands of stills

344
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,840
and as much documentary footage
as we could get from archives.

345
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,280
There was so much wonderful
documentary material on Vietnam

346
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,080
you know, that had not been shot
in any other war,

347
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,360
including scenes of men dying.

348
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,960
So, looking at 100 hours
of documentary films,

349
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,480
actually probably tells you more
than if you were there

350
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,880
and didn't actually have combat.

351
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,120
The title, Full Metal Jacket,
how did it come?

352
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,000
Full Metal Jacket
is a type of bullet design,

353
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,520
which...where the lead of the bullet
is encased in copper.

354
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,600
It's done to increase
the reliability of the bullet,

355
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
feeding up the ramp
into the chamber from the magazine

356
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,760
because it's smoother.

357
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,320
And also, I think the Geneva
Convention has laid down

358
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,280
that it's
a more humane type of bullet

359
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,640
because lead expands a little bit

360
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,000
and this one just goes
and makes a nice clean hole.

361
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,640
(GUNSHOT)

362
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,040
Do you think
the problem of a war film

363
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,400
is whatever you do to not to involve
the audience into the battles,

364
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,760
not to give them
a vicarious experience?

365
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,440
But isn't it an ethical problem
for a filmmaker?

366
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,800
When you read the memoirs of people
that have survived the war,

367
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,360
many of them look back on it

368
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,120
as being the greatest moments
of their lives.

369
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,320
So obviously there must be an aspect
to it that is genuinely inspiring

370
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,880
and spectacular
in the real sense of the word.

371
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,240
And the elements of comradeship,
loyalty, courage, those things,

372
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,360
in retrospect,
people who take part in it are moved.

373
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,960
It is then with great pride
that I note the fine work done

374
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,240
by the soldiers of this command
during the recent operation.

375
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,720
It is with pleasure
that I say a job well done.

376
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,200
If you are interested by war
in itself and the ambiguity of war,

377
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,120
there is not ambiguity in the way
you look at the hierarchy,

378
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,320
I mean, whether in Dr. Strangelove
or even in Paths of Glory,

379
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,240
or in this film,
the drill instructor.

380
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,240
Well, the drill instructor
in this film

381
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,280
I think is naive as the boys are,
he is just programmed to do that.

382
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,360
Did your parents have any
children that lived?
Sir, yes, sir, yes.

383
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,680
I bet they regret that.

384
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,480
You're so ugly you could be
a modern art masterpiece.

385
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,600
Lee Ermey
was a Parris Island drill instructor,

386
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,320
he actually was the way he played.

387
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,160
He was hired as a technical adviser,

388
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,840
and I was looking for an actor
for the part.

389
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,840
But when we started
interviewing boys,

390
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,920
for the recruits at Parris Island,

391
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
we had the idea that Lee would do
an improvisation with them,

392
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,320
just originally this was just to see
how they would react.

393
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,760
And he did what he did in the scene,
