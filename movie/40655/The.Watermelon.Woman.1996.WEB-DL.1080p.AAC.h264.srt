1
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:55,307
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?

2
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:56,459
Where you want it?

3
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:01,366
Can you smile really
pretty for the camera?

4
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,949
Aww, isn't that sweet?

5
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:04,187
Why don't y'all fool around?

6
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:05,546
Why don't y'all
run around, Sadie?

7
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,060
Oh, "pocket,"
you know the whole song.

8
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:14,468
Okay, Joshua, get up in there.

9
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:15,869
Just get up in there.

10
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,100
Throw yourself.

11
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:19,165
All fall down!

12
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:29,277
Okay, let me just tighten
you guys up in here.

13
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:30,946
Very nice.

14
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,149
Could you just angle it
a little bit more?

15
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:34,282
Great! Come over.

16
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:35,848
You two switch places.

17
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,792
Looks great.

18
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,262
Could you two guys in the back

19
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:42,060
switch places, please?

20
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,426
Sir!

21
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,368
Excuse me, sir?

22
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,803
We're working with
the family right now.

23
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,204
- Oh.
- Don't you--

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,868
don't you even see
the video equipment?

25
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,537
Why don't you just,
like, wait your turn?

26
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,877
- Okay.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:57,913 --> 00:02:00,246
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, what a day.

28
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,113
We'll take care of it, you know.

29
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,144
We'll get the video done
as soon as we can

30
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,088
and deliver it to you, okay?

31
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:08,318
Thank you.

32
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,825
Let me see that.

33
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:15,490
Lord.

34
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:18,160
Ooh, I love cash!

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,964
I don't like cash,
I like checks,

36
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:21,868
but this will have to do, okay?

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,966
Uh, can I use the equipment this
weekend to work on my project?

38
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,453
You know, this is
the third weekend in a row

39
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:29,843
you want to use the equipment,

40
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,370
but you've yet
to shoot anything.

41
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,406
Uh-uh, my cut is $50 short.

42
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,941
You remember what Rose and Gwen
said in the "Go Fish" book.

43
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:38,477
If you want to make a film,
you gotta make some sacrifices.

44
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,923
And besides, we have to make
money payments on the camera.

45
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:43,391
Ticket to Hollywood, baby!

46
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:46,453
Excuse you, I'm not, like,
into making sacrifices

47
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:49,260
for some quote-unquote
"future," all right?

48
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:51,494
I want to take Stacey out
this weekend for dinner,

49
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:54,993
and for that I need cash today,
okay, so just give me my money--

50
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,082
- I'll lend you some money.
- ...and cut the attitude.

51
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,917
- I'll lend you some money.
- Lend me some money?

52
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,252
You gonna lend me
my own damn money?

53
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,972
You worse than white people
in a bank.

54
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,980
Oh, my God.
It's raining.

55
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:05,857
I don't care if it's raining.
Give me my damn money.

56
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,359
What does one got to do
with the other?

57
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:08,612
Give me my money, Cheryl.

58
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,995
Don't be frontin'
with no attitude.

59
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,196
Okay, I'll give you your money.

60
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,420
I know you're givin' it to me.

61
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:13,616
Shit.

62
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,439
What are you shooting anyway?

63
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:21,658
First you're arguing with me,

64
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:22,941
now, and then you're shooting?

65
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:24,263
It's urban realism!

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,030
Come on, won't this
be a nice contrast?

67
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,502
So these people
will really know,

68
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:29,596
on their day
of sacred matrimony--

69
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:31,198
These people don't want
to put this mess

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,367
in their video, Tamara.

71
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:35,003
Well, honey, they're paying me,

72
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,275
this is my impression
of their wedding.

73
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:40,010
So, how is your video going?

74
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,450
Uh, I'm gonna use
the equipment tonight,

75
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:43,976
if that's possible.

76
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,419
What are you shooting?

77
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,946
Come on, Cheryl,
this is the really good stuff.

78
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,154
This is like urban... poverty...

79
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:53,253
very raw,
it's very in, very new.

80
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:54,991
I just don't believe it.

81
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,965
Look, I'm tired of you
and your projects.

82
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,510
The Watermelon Woman,
who the hell is she?

83
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,196
- Turn off the camera.
- Who cares?

84
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,228
I don't want this stuff
to be on film.

85
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,527
Hi, I'm Cheryl,

86
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,727
and I'm a filmmaker.

87
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,630
Uh, no, I'm not really
a filmmaker,

88
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,162
but I have a videotaping
business with my friend Tamara,

89
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:38,640
and I work at a video store,

90
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:41,109
so I'm working
on being a filmmaker.

91
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:44,580
The problem is I don't know
what I want to make a film on.

92
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,673
I know it has to be
about black women

93
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:49,048
because our stories
have never been told,

94
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,643
so I've been renting movies--

95
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,314
No, I haven't been
renting movies,

96
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,016
but I get movies
from the video store

97
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:56,616
that I work at, and I've taken
all these films out

98
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,992
from the '30s and '40s
with black actresses in them,

99
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:02,692
like, um, Hattie McDaniel
and Louise Beavers,

100
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:06,327
and, um, in these films,
in some of the films,

101
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,599
the black actresses aren't
even listed in the credits,

102
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,505
and I was just
totally shocked by that.

103
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,237
So, in this one film
that came into the store,

104
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,302
"Plantation Memories,"

105
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:20,646
I saw the most beautiful
black mammy named Elsie,

106
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:23,414
and I just had
to show this, so...

107
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:27,255
Watch.

108
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,053
Missy Barbara?

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,469
Oh, don't cry, Missy.

110
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:43,267
Master Charles
is coming back for sure.

111
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,137
I know he is.

112
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:46,733
Do you really think so, Elsie?

113
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,244
Oh, yes, Missy Barbara,
I know he is.

114
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:52,043
I prayed to God all night long,
and this morning,

115
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,710
His little angel told me
that he was coming back.

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,309
Back to you.

117
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:18,531
Her name: The Watermelon Woman.

118
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:20,668
That's right, Watermelon Woman.

119
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,474
Is "Watermelon Woman"
her first name, her last name,

120
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:25,674
or is it her whole name?

121
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,616
I don't know,
but girlfriend has it goin' on,

122
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:32,486
and I think I've figured out
what my project's gonna be on.

123
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,251
I'm gonna make
a movie about her.

124
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,782
I'm gonna find out
what her real name is,

125
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,384
who she was and is,

126
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,191
everything I can find out
about her,

127
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,198
because something in her face,

128
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,291
something in the way
she looks and moves

129
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,632
is serious, is interesting,

130
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,797
and I'm gonna just
tell you all about it.

131
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:10,420
Hey, Tamara, is Bob here?

132
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,155
Late again, you know,

133
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:14,139
you really should try
to pick up the phone sometime

134
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,461
because I called you
this morning

135
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,329
to let you know Bob
was coming in early.

136
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,895
Or were you at
the White Dog Cafe

137
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,901
cruising all
the cute girls again?

138
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,607
No, I was home doing something

139
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,337
more important
than this place, thank you.

140
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:29,345
You know, you don't have
to work here, Cheryl.

141
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,711
Sorry I got you the damn job
in the first place.

142
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,273
Tamara, that was two years ago,
you know, it's time to move on.

143
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:35,784
I'm a filmmaker, you know.

144
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:39,720
Anyway, did those special order
tapes come in yet?

145
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,485
Yes, they're over here.

146
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:45,326
I certainly hope that...

147
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:48,160
Mike O'Reilly likes
those films as much as you do.

148
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:51,361
I can't believe you're wasting
a tape scam to order them.

149
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,165
I can barely stand the stuff
that Hollywood puts out now,

150
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,695
let alone that nigga mammy
shit from the '30s.

151
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,666
Oh, my God, look what's here!

152
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,574
A film with
The Watermelon Woman in it!

153
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,602
Like I said, boring stuff.

154
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,477
All you do since
you don't have a girlfriend

155
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,346
is watch those boring old films.

156
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,749
I'd rather watch
boring old films

157
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:10,616
than black porn like you.

158
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:12,484
Okay, there is no need to get

159
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:14,387
into my personal shit
up in here, okay?

160
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:16,415
I was just kiddin'
in the first place.

161
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,188
What I meant to say was, uh,

162
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:19,820
what are you doin' tonight?

163
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,558
Probably watching these.

164
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:23,964
You want to go out
with Stacey and me?

165
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,395
With a four-month-old
lesbian relationship?

166
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:29,371
She has a friend in
from out of town.

167
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,204
- Not another blind date, Tamara.
- Oh, come on, Cheryl,

168
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,800
I apologized for that
a million times.

169
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,402
How was I supposed to know
that she was spiritual?

170
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,573
It's your turn
to wait on a customer.

171
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:39,946
Spiritual is not the word.

172
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:42,542
Heavy afro-fem-centric
is the word.

173
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,918
Remember Sister
Yafumila Ifá In-de-lay?

174
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:48,685
You wait on a customer
'cause I just clocked in.

175
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,558
Tired late ass getting on
my last black nerve.

176
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:54,824
How can I help you?

177
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:57,560
Yes, do you have
The Three Tenors?

178
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,261
No, I'm sorry, it's out.

179
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:01,995
Thank you.

180
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,475
I think it's time for me
to sing my song.

181
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,774
What song?
Not the one you tried to--

182
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,303
--I mean, sang back in college.

183
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:48,374
Right, the one I sang for the...

184
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,852
Spike Lee audition
at the Black Deb Ball.

185
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,320
Tell them, Stacey.

186
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,323
Tell them how
I almost got the part.

187
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:55,881
Part? Are you sure you--

188
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:58,450
Are you sure you want them
to know that story?

189
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,894
Why not?

190
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,557
I'm a singer, right?

191
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:04,726
Tell them I'm a singer.

192
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,734
What's this about
a Spike Lee audition?

193
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,517
She's gonna look really
stupid if she gets up

194
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,770
on that stage and can't sing.

195
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,744
It was our freshman year
in college,

196
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,336
and it was rumored
that Spike Lee

197
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:18,779
was gonna be on campus

198
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,612
recruiting for his new film
on black schools.

199
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,675
Anyway, our little
black group on campus

200
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:24,380
decides to throw a party
in the hopes

201
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,752
that Spike will come
and discover us.

202
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,519
And Miss Yvette shows up
with this tight ass,

203
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:32,960
and I mean tight ass,
red polka-dot outfit.

204
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:35,794
- Outfit, man.
- She goes up to the DJ,

205
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,460
makes him turn off the music
in the middle of a slow jam,

206
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,968
and then starts to sing.

207
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:42,699
And...

208
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:45,003
And this boy throws
a drink in her face.

209
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,100
That was the first time
I had ever seen Yvette

210
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,811
go off like that, I mean,
she put the boy in the hospital.

211
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:51,643
It was the beginning
of what we called

212
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,615
Yvette's real emotional period.

213
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:55,744
Real emotional, huh?

214
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:58,083
But she's cute though,
Cheryl, don't forget that.

215
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,986
- Great.
- All right, ladies.

216
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,787
Yvette would like to perform
"Lovin' You."

217
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,725
Let's hear it for Yvette.

218
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,921
Yeah!

219
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,896
Behave.

220
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,764
Thank you. Thank you.

221
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,634
I'd like to dedicate
this song to my friends,

222
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,401
Tamara, Stacey, and Cheryl.

223
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:19,698
Great.

224
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,222
Um, excuse me, sir?

225
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:48,862
Can I ask you a question.

226
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:49,956
Shoot.

227
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:51,830
Uh, can you tell me,

228
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,666
do you know who
The Watermelon Woman is?

229
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,171
Watermelon Woman?

230
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:58,002
Yeah, she's the one
who originated

231
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,906
what we call Aunt Jemima,

232
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,500
like on the syrup bottles.

233
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,614
From the sound of the name,

234
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:08,242
she must've been
in early Hollywood cinema.

235
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,884
Watermelon Woman,
I think she's from Philly.

236
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:16,551
I... is she from Philly?

237
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:22,554
Isn't she the lady that wore
the fruit cocktail on her head?

238
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:24,088
No, that's Rosie Perez, Bookah.

239
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:25,677
Well, that could've been
her alias name.

240
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,169
Oh, child, I don't think so.

241
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,980
She wore the fruit cocktail
with the leaves and--

242
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,939
No, no, no, uh-uh.

243
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:32,270
Was that Aunt Je--

244
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,100
- Avocadoes and things?
- No, no.

245
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:35,667
No, that's--that's still--

246
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:36,940
isn't that Rosie?

247
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:38,674
It was not Rosie!
She was from--

248
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,558
This was lady was from back
in the '40s and '50s.

249
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:41,948
Oh, well,
it could've been Rosie.

250
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:43,781
She looks like she was
in the '40s and '50s.

251
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,812
- Ooh, Rosie gonna kill you.
- Okay, well, thank you.

252
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,815
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Thank you, you have a good one.

253
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,758
Watermelon Woman.

254
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,629
Do you think
you've heard of her?

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,127
- No.
- No.

256
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,735
My mother was
the first person I called up

257
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:09,608
because I knew she'd have
something to say

258
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:11,613
about The Watermelon Woman.

259
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:13,171
She is a collector of sorts.

260
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,741
A better word for her
is a collector of junk.

261
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,879
She never throws anything away.

262
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,913
Keeps things "filed" away
in the basement.

263
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:23,949
As you can see,
her "filing" system

264
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:25,221
needs updating.

265
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,058
I mean, look at it all.

266
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:29,189
Old books, boxes of clothing,

267
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,201
my dance costumes,
my brother's Star Trek models,

268
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,669
her dead mother
and brother's stuff.

269
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:37,673
She even has boxes
of the most remarkable props

270
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:39,937
from when she used to go
to the movies back then.

271
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:42,911
You know, picture cards
and magazines.

272
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,936
I just can't find them,
is the problem.

273
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,176
...the box was in the closet.

274
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,912
Why don't you
listen to me, Cheryl?

275
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:51,920
Ugh, Mom.

276
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:54,152
Then the other one.

277
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:55,350
How do I look, Cheryl?

278
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,819
Oh, you look fine.

279
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,622
Get those earrings on,
you look good.

280
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,856
- You think so?
- Yeah, this is for the video,

281
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:04,230
so don't worry, it's not,
you know, gonna be too deep.

282
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:07,293
So, you saw lots of films
when you were growing up

283
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:09,236
in the '30s, right?

284
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:12,002
Oh, yes, saw a lot of films.

285
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,807
And one of your favorite stars
was The Watermelon Woman, right?

286
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,142
The who?

287
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,374
The Watermelon Woman.

288
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,275
Remember the skinny girl
we talked about?

289
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:23,149
I didn't see the Waterwho--

290
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:24,778
I never heard of
The Watermelon Woman.

291
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,345
Oh, come--Mom!

292
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:28,266
Look, I took off from work
to come all the way out here

293
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,815
to ask you about
The Watermelon Woman.

294
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:30,902
Now, wait a minute, Cheryl.

295
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:32,069
You're talking to your mother.

296
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:33,356
You don't talk to me like that.

297
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,025
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

298
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:39,057
but I specifically wanted
to talk to you about this,

299
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,695
and you acted like
you knew before.

300
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,796
What--did you see
any movies back then

301
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,034
with any other actresses?

302
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:47,008
Oh, yes, uh-huh,

303
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,408
but I didn't see that one.

304
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,407
- I saw Queenie.
- Queenie?

305
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,409
Yeah, she was in
"Gone With the Wind."

306
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,842
You mean Butterfly McQueen?

307
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:54,941
Well, okay.

308
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,316
She was in "Gone With the Wind."

309
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:00,151
And we saw some of these
other actresses and things.

310
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:03,352
Yeah, well, I wanted to know
about The Watermelon Woman.

311
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,360
She was, um, in, um,

312
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:06,793
the films by Martha Page.

313
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:07,955
Look at this box.

314
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,390
Martha Page is the director.

315
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,199
Well, look at the black woman
in the picture.

316
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:17,433
That's The Watermelon Woman.

317
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:20,141
- I've seen her face before.
- Where?

318
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:24,904
It wasn't in any film
or anything.

319
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:27,916
I saw her a couple of times
at some clubs.

320
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,009
- Really?
- Yeah, she was singing.

321
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,883
Where? What clubs?

322
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,219
Oh, the clubs
we used to hang out at.

323
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:37,158
Oh, The Blue Note,

324
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,820
Showboat, Pep's.

325
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,261
- No!
- Different clubs like that.

326
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:43,424
Well, who was at
the clubs with you?

327
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:45,457
Oh, there was, um,

328
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,794
Hattie and...

329
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:51,739
Shirley, May, Jeannie.

330
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:53,901
- Mm-hmm.
- Just a regular old gang.

331
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,433
You know, we'd go there.

332
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:57,446
But, um,

333
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,175
I don't know.

334
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:00,409
Did they like the clubs?

335
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:02,713
Oh, they were weirdos.

336
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:06,017
- No!
- Yes, weird people were there.

337
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:08,956
Uh-huh, kinda sounds like
my type of people.

338
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,754
Yes, you would've loved it.

339
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,632
- You would've loved it.
- I'm sure I would've.

340
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,767
You know it's, uh, two-for-one
Monday through Thursday.

341
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:25,933
Really?

342
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,408
Yeah.

343
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:28,910
I'm having a hard time deciding.

344
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,503
What do you think?
"Cleopatra Jones,"

345
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:33,340
"Jason's Lyric,"
or "Personal Best"?

346
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:36,977
Hmm, well,
"Cleopatra Jones" is really fun.

347
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:39,044
Why don't you do
"Cleopatra Jones"

348
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:41,181
and... "Carrie"?

349
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,817
I think the two go
really well together.

350
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,123
I know, but "Carrie,"
I hate Sissy Spacek.

351
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,289
She's all weird and pale
and thin and anorexic

352
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,992
in this movie.

353
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:51,776
I kind of like my girls
with meat on their bones,

354
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,768
you know what I mean?

355
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:53,928
Anyway, I just saw it.

356
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:57,997
Well, um, there's always, uh,

357
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,507
some sci-fi like "Aliens,"

358
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,067
or how about, uh,

359
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,908
"Repulsion" with
Catherine Deneuve?

360
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,456
She goes nuts
in her apartment one night.

361
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,210
Oh, I just moved in
to a new apartment.

362
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:09,012
I don't think I need that.

363
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,418
Well, help yourself,
it's two-for-one.

364
00:18:12,454 --> 00:18:14,116
Okay, thanks for
your suggestions.

365
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:15,214
You're welcome.

366
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,489
- So, who's the cutie?
- Some customer.

367
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:24,556
She's got nice bone structure
if you're into white girls.

368
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,234
Do you think she is
or isn't in the family?

369
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:30,295
Tamara, why are you always
constantly clocking women?

370
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,170
We're lesbians,
remember, Cheryl?

371
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,233
We're into female-to-female
attraction.

372
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:35,886
Anyway, you're the one
who's supposed to be

373
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,401
clocking all the girls.

374
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:40,040
How long's it been since
you've been with one anyway?

375
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,880
A week. Remember the
emotionally-unbalanced Yvette?

376
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,953
Come on, Cheryl,
she was not that bad.

377
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:48,332
- Yes, she was.
- Besides, she called Stacey

378
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:50,154
last night
and she asked about you.

379
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,456
- Oh, she was all--
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

380
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:54,861
If you two worked
as much as you talked,

381
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:57,127
I'd have a chain
of video stores by now.

382
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,468
Tamara, Cheryl,

383
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:02,937
I'd like to introduce you
to your coworker,

384
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:04,269
Annie Hinkley.

385
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:05,864
Heath, Annie Heath.

386
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,102
Yeah, Annie Heath.

387
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:09,168
She's a Bryn Mawr
graduate, right?

388
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,509
Right. It's nice
to meet you, Cheryl.

389
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:14,312
It's nice to meet you, Tamara.

390
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,254
I'll tell you what, Cheryl,
why don't you help Annie

391
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,054
learn the Bob system
while waiting on this customer?

392
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,188
- Okay.
- Miss Attitude,

393
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,423
in my office.

394
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:31,192
Let's go.

395
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,224
Okay, so I'm taking you
up on your suggestion,

396
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:34,634
and it's two-for-one, right?

397
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,098
Right.

398
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,867
So, maybe I should go
get the tapes?

399
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:40,569
No, no, stay here
and we'll do this together.

400
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:43,407
- Okay.
- Um, name on the account?

401
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:45,437
It's Rolland,
but it's a new account.

402
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,382
Okay, new accounts get rung up
like any other order

403
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,217
except we have to get her,
uh, name and address,

404
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,484
phone number,
and I'll get her credit card.

405
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,252
Gotcha.

406
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,884
Can I have your credit card?

407
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:00,286
Thanks.

408
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:03,660
All right,
so the name is Rolland.

409
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:05,899
And your first name?

410
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,163
Diana.

411
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,363
And your address?

412
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,271
4043 Ludlow.

413
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:13,468
Thank you.

414
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,975
And that's 4043...

415
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,446
And your phone number?

416
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,950
Uh, 555-2112.

417
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:26,211
Okay, that's it.

418
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:27,552
Don't I have to sign something?

419
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:29,319
Oh, yeah, sorry.

420
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,302
You know, Cheryl, I've worked
in a video store before.

421
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:33,504
I mean, I just get the tapes
she wants and scan 'em, right?

422
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:34,928
Yeah.

423
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:37,558
So, I'm getting
"Repulsion" and...

424
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,577
- ..."Cleopatra Jones."
- "Cleopatra Jones," right.

425
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,178
I'll get 'em, they're
in alphabetical order.

426
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:42,295
Alphabetical.

427
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:45,130
Can I have my credit card back?

428
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:47,005
Oh, I'm sorry, here you go.

429
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:50,540
Thanks.

430
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,475
Here we go.

431
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,287
All right, there you go.

432
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:01,321
Thank you.

433
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,053
Uh, would you like a bag?

434
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,390
No, thanks,

435
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:06,519
Cheryl.

436
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,361
You're welcome.

437
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:11,366
And that's how you take
a customer order.

438
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:14,096
You mean, that's how a customer
picks up an employee.

439
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:16,366
If it's that easy, I need
to get a name tag, Cheryl.

440
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:09,417
The other day, I mentioned
my project to Tamara's mother,

441
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:11,426
and she gave me this card.

442
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,451
Some friend of the family,
no doubt.

443
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:16,555
She said this Lee character
is really into black film.

444
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:19,033
Tamara told me that
when she was a child,

445
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:22,162
she saw Lee trying to hit
on her older cousin Tyrone,

446
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:24,672
and Tyrone kicked him
in the balls.

447
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:26,402
Well, with a background
like that,

448
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,410
you know I had to go
check him out.

449
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:31,242
I even brought Miss Tammy along
to help me film it all.

450
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,239
So, you came to see
what I got, huh?

451
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:36,308
Yup.
What's this stuff over here?

452
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:39,185
Oh, got some posters here

453
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,688
from some black cast films,

454
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:42,816
like this one here,
got "Gone Harlem"

455
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,582
with Ethel Moses.

456
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,788
Kinda sultry sepia diva.

457
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:49,059
She's just reclining there.

458
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:51,589
Got July Jones,
"Juke Joint" here.

459
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,499
Ralph Cooper
in "Dark Manhattan."

460
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,400
Ralph Cooper used to MC
at the Apollo.

461
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:56,699
His son still works up there.

462
00:22:56,738 --> 00:22:58,138
I like this one up here.

463
00:22:58,172 --> 00:22:59,663
Got Bill Pickett,

464
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:02,506
World's Colored Champion,
"The Bull-Dogger."

465
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,073
- Tough.
- Oh.

466
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:07,514
Come on in here.

467
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,074
Now, everything is authentic

468
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:12,644
except some of the race
memorabilia in the kitchen

469
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:15,088
and, uh, this sign here.

470
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:16,455
Right up there.

471
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:18,687
Drama, 'cause you know
who serves the drama

472
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,160
in this household, right?

473
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:21,218
Please.

474
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,665
Well, what's this Royal Theatre?

475
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:28,466
The Royal,
the Standard, the Dunbar.

476
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:32,099
Those were the places to be
in the '20s and '30s.

477
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,336
South Street was jumpin'
with night life.

478
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,344
- Like South Street now?
- Hell no, girl!

479
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:38,437
South Street sucks now!

480
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,414
The Royal and the Dunbar,

481
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,110
those were black-owned--
write this down--

482
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,642
those were black-owned,
black-operated,

483
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:46,780
right up until and even
after the Depression.

484
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:49,256
Black folks wanted to see
the Hollywood stuff,

485
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,192
you know, with the stars
and the costumes.

486
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:53,250
All that junk.

487
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:57,227
Got my little office
right back here.

488
00:23:57,265 --> 00:23:59,257
- See, "Film Department."
- Yes.

489
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,667
- Voilà.
- Wow!

490
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:03,501
What an impressive setup.

491
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:05,370
You mean expensive setup.

492
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:06,772
- Whoa, sorry there.
- That's okay.

493
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,640
Cheryl, ask him about
The Watermelon Woman.

494
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:10,804
Never heard that name before.

495
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:12,404
Watermelon, no, no...

496
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,886
Tell him the name
of the woman who directed it.

497
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,387
Watermelon Woman, mm-mm.

498
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,582
What was the name again?

499
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:22,851
Martin--

500
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,483
Martha, Martha Page.

501
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,551
She was a white woman director.

502
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:28,358
Martha, a woman, huh?

503
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,155
Women are not my specialty,
I tell you.

504
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,293
Of course they aren't.
Look at you!

505
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:36,167
What was that, Tamara?

506
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:38,867
Cheryl, I have some
Photoplay magazines

507
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:41,375
for you in the basement,
I'll get 'em for you, all right?

508
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:43,401
You can take 'em with you
when you leave.

509
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,740
You can be so rude sometimes.

510
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:58,623
The Royal,
the Standard, the Dunbar.

511
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:02,289
Those were the places to be
in the '20s and '30s.

512
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:13,268
20th and South, that was it!

513
00:25:13,307 --> 00:25:15,572
Everyone who was anyone
wanted to be up there,

514
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,636
you know, in the theater,
seeing the shows

515
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:19,704
and the movies.

516
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:21,511
Really great.

517
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,348
If they had only played
those black cast films,

518
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:26,616
those theaters would've gone
out of business

519
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:28,247
during the Depression.

520
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,258
Black folks wanted to see
the Hollywood stuff,

521
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,988
you know, with the stars
and the costumes.

522
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,786
All that junk.

523
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:35,956
Yeah.

524
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:42,803
The, uh, black cast stuff
or negro stuff,

525
00:25:42,837 --> 00:25:44,999
that played before
the Hollywood features.

526
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:47,842
Well, you know,

527
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,505
that was, uh, that was it
for the sisters back then.

528
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:54,448
You know, playing
that domestic help.

529
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:56,576
Hmm, I bet that's how
The Watermelon Woman

530
00:25:56,617 --> 00:25:57,846
got her start.

531
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:59,717
Oh, don't cry, Missy.

532
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:02,519
Master Charles
is coming back for sure.

533
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,423
I know he is.

534
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,984
Do you really think so, Elsie?

535
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:08,587
Oh, yes, Missy Barbara,
I know he is.

536
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:11,360
I prayed to God all night long,
and this morning,

537
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,301
His little angel told me
that he was coming back.

538
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:15,667
Back to you.

539
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:40,488
There you go.

540
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:41,860
Are the green plums in yet?

541
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:43,364
Ma'am, not until Tuesday

542
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:45,457
when all the other produce
comes in.

543
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:50,597
Need anything else?

544
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:52,038
- No, I think that's it.
- You sure?

545
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:53,871
You'd expect
a young girl like that

546
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,900
to be quick about things.

547
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:57,969
What is she buying anyway?

548
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:01,683
Be ten dollars, please.

549
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:03,014
Um, do you want some money?

550
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,541
I'll pay for half of it.

551
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:06,019
No, I got it,
you can buy the wine.

552
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,521
Okay, that's fair.

553
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:09,046
Hey, it's Cheryl
from the video store.

554
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,581
Yeah, I saw you
standing in line.

555
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,093
- I thought I'd say hi.
- Hi.

556
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,591
Let's go, Diana, we have
a lot of errands to run.

557
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:16,598
- May I help you?
- Yes, carrots and broccoli.

558
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:18,623
Carrots and broccoli,
right here.

559
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,464
Carrots,

560
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:21,764
and we have broccoli.

561
00:27:25,373 --> 00:27:26,671
Four dollars.

562
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,651
Damn, Tamara,
what's up with that?

563
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:39,950
Look, we gots to go
or Is is gonna be late.

564
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:42,422
For what? Can't you see
I'm just getting into it?

565
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:44,084
Dang, Cheryl, all these books!

566
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,869
Isn't there a limit
to how much you can take out?

567
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,953
Twenty. Don't you think
I asked before I came down?

568
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:50,276
I mean, it's not like I can go
and ask for information out

569
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,832
about The Watermelon Woman.

570
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:53,710
They only have references
on black women in film.

571
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,965
Well, did you ask
at the reference desk?

572
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:57,562
Tamara, pick up the book.

573
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,096
I don't think
you're listening to me.

574
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:04,043
I'm not listening
to you, Cheryl,

575
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:06,513
because we have to go, okay?

576
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,846
I promised Stacey
that I'd meet her at her house,

577
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,727
and I want to get there
a little bit early, you know,

578
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:12,117
give her some wine,
some flowers.

579
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:13,951
I'm trying to get some tonight.

580
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:17,390
Look, I just have to do
one more thing, then we can go.

581
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:18,586
Okay?

582
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:24,431
Cheryl, you're next, come on.

583
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:29,434
I have to be there
in 20 minutes.

584
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:31,972
- Hi.
- Hi.

585
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,406
Um, I'm looking for information

586
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,704
on The Watermelon Woman.

587
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:36,904
She was a black actress
in the 1930s.

588
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:39,607
I seem to be having
a bit of trouble.

589
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:41,739
Nothing comes up.

590
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:45,810
Check the black section
in the reference library.

591
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,056
Um, well, how about Martha Page?

592
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:53,619
She was a white woman director
in the 1930s.

593
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,459
All this information
is referenced

594
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:57,760
in the reference section.

595
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:59,494
Have you checked
the reference section

596
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,865
of the library, Miss?

597
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,529
Well, both were
involved in films,

598
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,681
and I thought there was
some sort of non-reference book

599
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,936
that could be checked out
on women in film and...

600
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,738
Well, have you tried
the film section,

601
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:11,871
- PM 1993 to 1995?
- Yes, we have.

602
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:13,657
Why does he think
we're waiting in this line?

603
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:14,808
Shut up, Tamara.

604
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,051
The names again.

605
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,212
Uh, The Watermelon Woman
and Martha Page.

606
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:23,788
Watermelon Woman?

607
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:29,063
The only thing that's
coming up is Martha Page.

608
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:32,533
She is listed in several
non-reference titles

609
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:34,057
on women in film.

610
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:36,002
No, no Watermelon Woman.

611
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:39,871
Check the reserve desk
on the third floor.

612
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:42,806
Next on line, please.

613
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:31,583
Great news:
With my mom's help,

614
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,823
we went through some
of her "files" in the basement.

615
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:36,592
It took all day,
but we found info

616
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,030
on her old friend Shirley.

617
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:39,533
Miss Shirley.

618
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,830
Never married,

619
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:42,894
worked in a factory
most of her life.

620
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:44,132
I think she's in the family.

621
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,037
Watermelon Woman?

622
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:49,100
Oh, you mean Fae, Fae Richards.

623
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:51,305
I thought her name was
The Watermelon Woman.

624
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,241
The Watermelon Woman.

625
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,545
I don't know where
you got that mess from,

626
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,950
probably from when she
was making those movies.

627
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:02,052
But her name was Fae Richards.

628
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:05,184
When she sang for us,
she used her real name.

629
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:08,628
And she used to sing
for all of us stone butches.

630
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:13,131
We used to stand
in front of the stage

631
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,033
and fight for position

632
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,867
so that she would look at us.

633
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:19,966
And, um,

634
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,635
one time I got in a fight

635
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,803
with this girl
from North Philly,

636
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:26,313
who kept popping
in my space, you know?

637
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:29,715
And, um,
but when Fae would sing,

638
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,946
oh, God, she was beautiful,

639
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,249
like poetry.

640
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:35,256
Why don't you tell me
what the clubs were like

641
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:38,225
back then, like,
who was at these clubs?

642
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:41,093
The clubs were mixed, you know?

643
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,994
The white folks owned 'em,

644
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,794
the black folks attended,

645
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:48,701
and the ofays came to socialize.

646
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,365
And we had a real good time
there, you know?

647
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,631
We really did, we all got along.

648
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:56,701
Was... Fae hanging
with the ofays?

649
00:31:56,744 --> 00:32:00,237
Yeah, Fae hung with the ofays
quite a bit, you know?

650
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:02,910
Especially, um, with the...

651
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,782
Martha--Martha Page,
is that her name?

652
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:06,788
Yeah, it was some--
one particular woman,

653
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,380
I think that was her name,
Martha Page.

654
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,614
She was, um,
big-time director.

655
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,650
- Yes, yes.
- Movie director.

656
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:16,391
And, uh, she and Fae
used to hang a lot,

657
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,930
and I think Fae, you know,
wanted to get into movies,

658
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,734
and, um, that's why she hung
so tough with them, you know,

659
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,034
and especially with Martha.

660
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,768
And I heard some very ugly--

661
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,276
If I remember
my gossip correctly,

662
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,213
that Martha Page was
one mean and ugly woman.

663
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:35,225
Maybe that's how you have to be
in the movie business.

664
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:36,945
Oh, no, no.

665
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:38,895
Do you have any pictures
from back then or anything?

666
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,388
- Yeah, I got a lot of pictures.
- Oh, good.

667
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:44,153
Used to save them
'cause, like back then,

668
00:32:44,191 --> 00:32:46,422
we could buy the pictures
in the clubs,

669
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,205
and the performers
would sign 'em for us.

670
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,130
- I see.
- And I kept my mirror covered

671
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:51,996
with all of these performers.

672
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:53,743
- You'd like to see 'em?
- I'd like to see them.

673
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,861
All right, wow.

674
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:58,134
Let's see what's in the box.

675
00:32:58,172 --> 00:33:00,801
You got any pictures
of, uh, Fae Richards?

676
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:03,401
Let me just see, I've got
so many pictures in here

677
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:04,776
of these performers.

678
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:06,405
Oh, look at that.

679
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:11,048
Oh, here it is, here it is.

680
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:12,747
Let's see, hold it up.

681
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:15,051
- Yeah, that's good.
- She was a looker, wasn't she?

682
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:17,422
Yeah, she was a looker,
all right.

683
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:21,887
Can you believe it?

684
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:24,091
Fae's a sapphic sister.

685
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,726
A bulldagger, a lesbian!

686
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,463
Oh, my gosh,
I knew something was up

687
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,398
when I saw
"Plantation Memories."

688
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:32,736
But with Martha Page?

689
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:36,471
Hmm, Fae was really
swinging back then.

690
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,305
I guess we have a thing or two
in common, Miss Richards.

691
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:41,975
The movies, and women.

692
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:28,191
Hey, Cheryl, Yvette's been
asking about you again.

693
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:30,129
- What?
- In fact, she and Stacey

694
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:33,100
are stopping by after work
tonight if you're interested.

695
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,364
Tamara, why'd you do that?
You know I don't like her.

696
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:37,496
What, you say
you don't like Stacey?

697
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:40,064
Yvette, it's Yvette
I don't like.

698
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:41,405
I don't like her anything.

699
00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:43,172
Her clothing,
her attitude, her look...

700
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,521
What's wrong
with the way she dresses?

701
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:46,036
I think she dresses nice.

702
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,140
Besides, Cheryl, she wants you.

703
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:49,946
So? I don't care
if she wants me.

704
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,078
I'm into dating women
with mental health right now.

705
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,179
See, that's what's
wrong with you.

706
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:57,555
I think Yvette's got it goin' on
with a bip and a bang.

707
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,020
You'd go for that.

708
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,187
Annie, you got a cigarette?

709
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:02,491
I'm going out to have a break.

710
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:04,293
- Sure, I'll join you.
- All right.

711
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,494
Oh, honey, I'm gonna have to see
some ID with this.

712
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:13,905
Cheryl, Tamara,
did either of you

713
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:16,308
take an order for Diana Rolland?

714
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:19,074
- Who?
- Rolland, this is a new account.

715
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:22,140
I just got a call
from Big Black Productions,

716
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:25,846
and they don't have
"Bald Black Ballbusters."

717
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:27,377
The rest of her order is here.

718
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:31,001
But when you get a chance,
would you give her a call

719
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:32,994
and let her know that
that title is unavailable,

720
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:34,188
but Big Black Bob is?

721
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:35,228
Sure.

722
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:39,600
"Bald Black Ballbusters."

723
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:42,194
Isn't that funny, Tamara?

724
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:44,535
Hysterical.

725
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,038
You said he never
checks that stuff.

726
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:53,240
I know he knows
I ordered them under her name.

727
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,216
He usually doesn't, but,
"Bald Black Ballbusters"?

728
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,843
Tamara, what's up with that?

729
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:59,251
Okay, I was like, curious to see

730
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:00,845
what they'd look like
without hair.

731
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:07,617
Hi, can I help you?

732
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,022
Oh, yeah.

733
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,862
Thank you.

734
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:18,233
Miss Rolland.

735
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:21,071
Uh, most of the tapes
you ordered have come in,

736
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:23,509
but one of them was unavailable.

737
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:25,012
They didn't have...

738
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:26,013
Cheryl?

739
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:27,537
Yeah, sorry, here.

740
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:31,915
They didn't have this title.

741
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:35,455
Oh... bummer.

742
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:38,449
Okay, well, um,
I guess I'll just take

743
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:39,892
the rest of them then.

744
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:41,361
- Can I charge it?
- Sure.

745
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,523
Thank you.

746
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,336
Tamara, would you get that?

747
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:56,275
Uh, I'm busy.

748
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,211
We're all set here,
Miss Rolland.

749
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:00,476
Uh, can I give you
a bag or a hand?

750
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:03,109
Uh, no bag, but maybe a hand?

751
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,985
Bob, it's some woman who says
she's your girlfriend.

752
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:10,516
yeah, I'll take it, thanks.

753
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:12,253
Cheryl, would you help her out?

754
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,487
Thanks. Bye, Diana.

755
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,623
So, uh, you need a hand, huh?

756
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:17,596
Yeah.

757
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:18,997
Okay.

758
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:29,938
Look, look, I'm really sorry
about what happened back there.

759
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:32,947
I mean, it's just a way
for us to get free tapes.

760
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,141
Free, huh?

761
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,985
I mean, we just special order
them under any customer's name,

762
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:41,488
and then we, you know,
preview them and return them.

763
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:44,651
Who's "we,"
some ballbuster you work with?

764
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,125
That's just another employee.

765
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,095
I mean, I'm really sorry
about all this.

766
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:49,706
Well, it looks like
if you want to see the videos,

767
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,141
you're gonna have
to come to my house

768
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:53,134
because they are mine now.

769
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,500
What's your--what's your
address and phone number?

770
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:57,562
Look it up, you have
my account information.

771
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,639
- Well?
- What happened?

772
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,673
She wants me to come
and get the tapes.

773
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,241
Score!

774
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,117
I do need a name tag
if it's that easy.

775
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:14,985
Honey, if a dog collar
didn't do it for you,

776
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,581
a name tag won't either.

777
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:21,025
So, tell me more about
this project you're working on.

778
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:22,359
Is it for school?

779
00:38:22,396 --> 00:38:24,126
Do I look like I'm a student?

780
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:25,689
I don't know, you could be.

781
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,325
I'm a filmmaker.

782
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,131
Oh, a filmmaker.

783
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,406
Uh, you got a big space here,

784
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:34,169
and a lot of it, too.

785
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:35,506
Yeah, I just moved in.

786
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:37,272
New account, remember?

787
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:39,746
You know, I actually used
to study film in Chicago.

788
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,214
Well, I studied film.

789
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:43,080
I studied art,
I studied art history,

790
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:44,607
I studied law,
and then I just...

791
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:47,018
- You just gave up, right?
- Right.

792
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:48,488
I needed to figure some shit out

793
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:50,423
before I wasted
more time at school.

794
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,551
What--what shit is that?

795
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:54,562
Like what I want to do
with my life.

796
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,393
You know, I want to do it all.

797
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,262
Do you know what I mean?

798
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:00,076
You know, I really wanted
to talk to you the other day

799
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,093
at the, um, produce truck,
but things were kind of crazy.

800
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:05,105
Well, your girlfriend
was giving me

801
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:07,232
these, like,
looks from hell, you know?

802
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:09,507
She's not my girlfriend.

803
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,677
I meant to say friend.

804
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:16,343
Your friend was giving me, like,
all these strange looks, and...

805
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,084
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

806
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,816
I'm actually cooking some food.

807
00:39:23,156 --> 00:39:24,317
Okay, yeah.

808
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:26,520
Great, come in, sit down.

809
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,619
Okay.

810
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:33,066
Irene, we'll be late.

811
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,592
Haven't you had enough
of that white powder?

812
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:40,201
How could you, Irene?

813
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,709
You know how hard it was
to find these films?

814
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:45,577
It's like one of the few race
films that she ever starred in.

815
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:46,636
Really?

816
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:51,378
Uh, do you mind if I smoke?

817
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:52,511
No, go ahead.

818
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,550
You know what's so weird
about this setup?

819
00:39:57,824 --> 00:39:59,258
What?

820
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:00,727
I don't know,
it just feels like...

821
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,627
you know, a setup, like...

822
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:04,188
I don't know, you know,

823
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:06,097
all this dinner and...

824
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,624
And... what?

825
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,760
And friendly conversation.

826
00:40:13,774 --> 00:40:17,267
Well, I have to confess
that I am a little--

827
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,746
no, I'm very attracted to you.

828
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:22,238
What?

829
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:23,682
Um, I was just gonna say

830
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:25,276
that you're really a cute woman.

831
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:26,412
I know that.

832
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:27,614
I heard what your friend said

833
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:29,247
at the video store.

834
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,417
- You heard us?
- I've had the hots for you

835
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:34,360
since the minute
I saw you shelving tapes.

836
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:36,260
Can I have a cigarette?

837
00:40:36,296 --> 00:40:37,628
Sure, help yourself.

838
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:43,437
Is the, um, fire in there, too?

839
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,837
Uh, yeah, but it's in a lighter.

840
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,242
So, um...

841
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:55,692
Now that we know that
we're attracted to each other,

842
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:56,843
what do we do?

843
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:59,546
- Um...
- Don't you think we should kiss?

844
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,225
You're a no-good lying tramp,
that's what you are!

845
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,321
Committing a sin that will
surely send you to hell.

846
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,697
I am going to hell,
but not for being a tramp,

847
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,567
but for being poor and living on
the streets like I've had to do.

848
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:17,901
Why can't I be happy
fitting into their world?

849
00:41:17,938 --> 00:41:20,601
God made me this color,
and He did it for a reason.

850
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,034
I'm still in shock
over the whole

851
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:57,828
having sex with Diana thing.

852
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:00,669
I've never done anything
like this before,

853
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,005
let me assure you.

854
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,944
The hip, swinging lesbian style
isn't my forte.

855
00:43:07,547 --> 00:43:09,709
You remember the Yvette thing?

856
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:10,927
I'm just an old fashioned girl

857
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:12,385
trying to keep up with the times

858
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:14,854
but Diana just
threw me for a loop.

859
00:43:14,888 --> 00:43:17,323
I mean, she's not my type

860
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:18,791
but I liked it.

861
00:43:18,825 --> 00:43:20,885
I don't know what to say next.

862
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:22,793
Maybe it all has to do
with this film project

863
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:25,355
which is finally
coming together.

864
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:27,526
Hollywood, The Watermelon Woman,

865
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,593
Fae Richards, and Diana?

866
00:43:40,614 --> 00:43:42,412
Well, look who it is, folks.

867
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:45,715
Hollywood's popular Fae
"The Watermelon Woman" Richards.

868
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:52,088
Taking a break
from the cameras and the lights,

869
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,954
Fae's back in her hometown,
Philadelphia,

870
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:57,328
to organize a benefit
for the city's chapter

871
00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:59,924
of the National Association
for the Advancement

872
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:01,093
of Colored People.

873
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:06,363
And get this, folks.

874
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:07,965
While in the city,
Ms. Richards spoke

875
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:10,807
with J. Liberty Wells,
the famous film director

876
00:44:10,844 --> 00:44:13,336
and president of
Liberty Motion Pictures,

877
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,111
about his upcoming black-cast
gangster picture.

878
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:23,047
Wouldn't this be the icing
on the cake for Ms. Richards

879
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:24,751
who has been in search
of a studio

880
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,589
to make her a star.

881
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:44,472
Well, actually,
the mammy figure, um,

882
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:45,621
is a great favorite of mine,

883
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,136
particularly Hattie McDaniel's

884
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,781
brilliant performance
in "Gone With the Wind."

885
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:52,650
I really am distressed
with a lot of the tone

886
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:55,918
of recent African American
scholarship.

887
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:58,653
It tries to say
about the mammy that--

888
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:02,754
that her largeness of figure
is desexualizing,

889
00:45:02,796 --> 00:45:05,095
degrading, dehumanizing,

890
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:07,100
um, and this seems to me
so utterly wrong.

891
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,692
Where the large woman
is a symbol

892
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,863
of abundance and fertility

893
00:45:10,904 --> 00:45:12,998
is a kind of goddess figure,

894
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,839
even the presence
of the mammy in the kitchen,

895
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:17,469
it seems to me,
has been misinterpreted.

896
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,411
Uh, "Oh, the woman in
the kitchen is a slave,

897
00:45:19,446 --> 00:45:20,709
a servant, a subordinate."

898
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:22,716
Well, my grandmothers,
my Italian grandmothers,

899
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:24,149
never left the kitchen.

900
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:25,761
In fact, this is why I dedicated
my first book to them.

901
00:45:25,785 --> 00:45:27,845
And Hattie McDaniel
in "Gone With the Wind"

902
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:29,947
is a spitting image
of my grandmother

903
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,925
and her style and her attitude,

904
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:32,958
her ferocity and so on,

905
00:45:32,993 --> 00:45:34,723
brings tears to my eyes.

906
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:36,739
The watermelon seems to me
another image that has been

907
00:45:36,763 --> 00:45:40,723
misinterpreted by a lot
of black commentary.

908
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:43,498
The great extended family
Italian get-togethers

909
00:45:43,536 --> 00:45:44,902
that I remember as a child

910
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:47,806
ended with the men
bringing out a watermelon

911
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:49,776
and ritualistically cutting it

912
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,505
and distributing
the pieces to everyone,

913
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:53,012
almost like the
communion service.

914
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:56,483
And I really dislike this
kind of reductionism,

915
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:59,145
of a picture, let's say,
of a small black boy

916
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:02,121
with a watermelon,
him smiling broadly over it,

917
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:03,851
looking at that as negative.

918
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,850
Why is that not instead
a symbol of joy and pleasure

919
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:09,692
and fruitfulness,

920
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:11,440
and after all, a piece
of watermelon has the colors

921
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:13,831
of the Italian flag,
red, white, and green,

922
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:15,665
so I'm biased to that extent.

923
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:17,227
But I think that, um,

924
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,905
if the watermelon symbolizes
African American culture,

925
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:21,669
rightly so,

926
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,234
because look what white
middle class feminism

927
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:26,639
stands for:
anorexia and bulimia.

928
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,741
Well, I've heard of
Martha Page before.

929
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:31,183
Okay, well, what
about Fae Richards,

930
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:32,845
The Watermelon Woman?

931
00:46:32,886 --> 00:46:36,516
If she's in anything
after 1960, don't ask us.

932
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:39,219
We haven't covered women in
the Blaxploitation movement yet.

933
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:40,693
Okay.

934
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,161
The Watermelon Woman,
Fae Richards,

935
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:44,926
was lovers with Martha Page,

936
00:46:44,964 --> 00:46:46,091
this white woman director.

937
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:47,156
Does...

938
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:50,095
Uh, wait a minute,
the actress was lovers

939
00:46:50,136 --> 00:46:51,627
with this famous direc--

940
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:53,264
- Yes.
- Well, first of all,

941
00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:56,271
I'm stunned to hear
that, um, that the director

942
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:58,000
was lesbian or bisexual.

943
00:46:58,044 --> 00:46:59,922
This is news to me
in the first place, all right,

944
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:02,916
but the idea of any kind of, um,

945
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:05,043
an interracial relationship
at this time,

946
00:47:05,085 --> 00:47:06,644
it's mind-boggling

947
00:47:06,686 --> 00:47:09,554
because we can see
decades after World War II

948
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:12,184
in "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner,"

949
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:14,854
you can see how charged
the question of any sort

950
00:47:14,894 --> 00:47:18,058
of interracial relationship was.

951
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:19,691
So, um, it seems to me

952
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:21,998
an astounding discovery
that you have made.

953
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:25,665
Oh, well, I guess I'll just,
uh, keep on pursuing it.

954
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:26,900
Well, good luck to you.

955
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,306
Well, thank you,
Professor Paglia.

956
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:29,736
Thank you very much.

957
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:33,005
Stacey doesn't like
that Campari either.

958
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:35,606
What do you mean "either"?

959
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:38,311
I mean, I don't think
that Stacey likes Diana.

960
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:42,146
I walked in there and they
were being all quiet and shit.

961
00:47:43,223 --> 00:47:44,987
Oh boy.

962
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:46,583
Guess it's time for Plan J.

963
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:49,095
Oh, excellent,
Stacey loves to smoke.

964
00:47:54,634 --> 00:47:56,830
A little before
dinner smoke, ladies?

965
00:47:57,837 --> 00:47:59,169
Oh, thank God.

966
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:00,205
Let me have a hit.

967
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:11,844
Then I said to him,
"Well, who do you think I am,

968
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:13,683
your slave?"

969
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,264
That beats Cheryl's story
of having to call

970
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:17,189
this snobby white woman
customer a nigger.

971
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:20,726
- Yeah, it does.
- So, Diana,

972
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,626
what brings you
to our fair city?

973
00:48:22,662 --> 00:48:24,062
Work, school?

974
00:48:24,097 --> 00:48:25,895
Um, no, I just decided to move.

975
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:28,595
I got sick of Chicago
and I decided to move to Philly,

976
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:29,967
the City of Brotherly Love.

977
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:32,029
And sisterly affection.

978
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:34,864
What?

979
00:48:34,908 --> 00:48:36,342
And sisterly affection.

980
00:48:36,376 --> 00:48:39,141
Brotherly and sisterly
affection, right, Stac?

981
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:43,706
Anyway, Diana, if you, uh,
came to Philadelphia

982
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,742
to escape the cold
Chicago winters,

983
00:48:45,785 --> 00:48:47,196
don't expect it to be
any better here.

984
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,664
Oh, I didn't leave
to escape the cold,

985
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:50,156
I needed a mental health break.

986
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,801
Good answer, Cheryl
likes her women to have

987
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,056
that mental health
thing going on.

988
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:55,371
Well, I like my women
a little crazy

989
00:48:55,395 --> 00:48:56,761
like you, darling.

990
00:48:58,131 --> 00:48:59,827
So, um, Cheryl tells me
you're in school.

991
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,027
Business, right?

992
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:03,127
I'm getting my MBA from Wharton.

993
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:04,967
My father went to Wharton.

994
00:49:05,004 --> 00:49:06,802
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

995
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,741
Yeah, but when he got out,
he couldn't get a job

996
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:10,835
and so he decided to join
the diplomatic corps.

997
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:12,743
He hated it but my mom loved it.

998
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,042
We traveled everywhere.

999
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,208
I was born when we were
stationed in Jamaica.

1000
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:18,980
- You were born in Jamaica?
- Yeah.

1001
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:20,680
I love telling people
where I was born.

1002
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,264
But we lived everywhere,
we lived in Germany

1003
00:49:22,288 --> 00:49:23,916
and California

1004
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:24,925
and Iceland.

1005
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,392
Iceland?

1006
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:29,954
Iceland, Bangladesh, Tel Aviv.

1007
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:31,276
I've lived just
about everywhere.

1008
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:34,893
I see.
Well, honey, I gotta tell you,

1009
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:37,335
I was born and bred
in the U.S. of A.

1010
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,066
Cheryl, how's
your project going?

1011
00:49:39,105 --> 00:49:41,768
I hear The Watermelon Woman's
gettin' pretty ripe.

1012
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:43,106
Yeah, it is, Tammy.

1013
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:44,906
But, uh, the project's
doing well.

1014
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,322
Tell Stacey how you're gonna
make your big move

1015
00:49:46,346 --> 00:49:48,076
to Hollywood with this project.

1016
00:49:48,114 --> 00:49:49,844
I almost forgot,
I have awesome news.

1017
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:51,977
- What?
- My brother's mother-in-law

1018
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:53,884
used to know this
famous casting agent.

1019
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,445
- And?
- And they know the Page family,

1020
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:56,883
as in Martha Page.

1021
00:49:56,923 --> 00:49:59,188
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm serious.

1022
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:00,955
Six degrees of separation

1023
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:02,360
but here it's only two.

1024
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:05,058
Anyway, I called
Mrs. Page-Fletcher

1025
00:50:05,098 --> 00:50:06,726
and, um, she would
love to talk to us

1026
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:08,394
about Martha and her life
and the movie.

1027
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:11,268
Us? I thought
this was Cheryl's project.

1028
00:50:11,304 --> 00:50:12,465
That's great, Diana.

1029
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:13,705
You're so sweet.

1030
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:17,248
- Cheers.
- So why does Cheryl always

1031
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:19,337
hook up with these
typical white devil types?

1032
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:21,211
She doesn't always
date white women.

1033
00:50:21,247 --> 00:50:22,840
And when she does,
they're just so...

1034
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:27,396
You know what
the most distressing thing is

1035
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,979
about this project?

1036
00:50:29,022 --> 00:50:30,285
It's Tamara.

1037
00:50:30,323 --> 00:50:33,316
I mean, in the past
she'd been--

1038
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,884
I mean, we've been friends,

1039
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:36,171
we've been friends
for a long time.

1040
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:37,473
I mean, we've been friends
for years.

1041
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:39,227
She got me the job at the store,

1042
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:40,309
we've done everything together,

1043
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,824
we're running buddies.

1044
00:50:41,868 --> 00:50:43,427
But somehow, on this project,

1045
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:45,870
something's going on
between the two of us

1046
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:47,931
that's just not working out.

1047
00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:49,306
Something is different.

1048
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:51,743
I mean, something's changed.

1049
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:53,738
I don't know if it's me,
I don't know if it's her.

1050
00:50:55,515 --> 00:50:57,006
It's just really upsetting.

1051
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:24,937
Damn, she's cute.

1052
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:28,791
Tamara, that's what you've
been saying about all of them.

1053
00:51:28,815 --> 00:51:31,182
Why don't you focus
on the performer for a while?

1054
00:51:31,217 --> 00:51:33,550
Isn't that why we brought
Little Orphan Annie along?

1055
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:37,086
Besides, I'm getting footage
for my video project.

1056
00:51:37,123 --> 00:51:39,149
Come on, Tamara, we're working.

1057
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:41,423
Cheryl, I help you
with your stuff.

1058
00:51:41,461 --> 00:51:45,865
Besides, who could resist
capturing all these fine,

1059
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,094
and I mean fine,
black women on film?

1060
00:51:55,441 --> 00:51:58,502
Hey, isn't that my
Native Studies teacher, Greta?

1061
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:00,843
Oh, and I bet that's
her girlfriend too.

1062
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,439
Cheryl, are you seeing this?

1063
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:05,919
Annie, you supposed to be
videotaping the performer,

1064
00:52:05,952 --> 00:52:07,352
not your friends.

1065
00:52:07,387 --> 00:52:09,322
- Sorry.
- Tamara, why don't you

1066
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:10,823
focus on the performer, okay?

1067
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:12,553
This is the last act.

1068
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:14,356
You're doing a great job, Annie.

1069
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:16,056
- Thanks, Cheryl.
- Shh!

1070
00:52:16,095 --> 00:52:17,495
I think she's about to finish.

1071
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:34,880
So...

1072
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:36,849
what's up with you and Annie?

1073
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:38,193
What do you mean
what's up with me and Annie?

1074
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:39,515
I don't like her.

1075
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:42,522
Obviously, you treat her
like shit all the time.

1076
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:44,888
I mean, she's just a kid
who was trying to help us out.

1077
00:52:44,924 --> 00:52:45,948
Help us out?

1078
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:48,086
She got paid, didn't she?

1079
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:50,528
I mean, she gets on my
last black lesbian nerve

1080
00:52:50,563 --> 00:52:53,465
with all that piercing,
hair dyed business.

1081
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:56,330
You gonna smoke
that joint, Bogart?

1082
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:00,639
Uh, Tamara...

1083
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:01,884
you know, we're different too,

1084
00:53:01,908 --> 00:53:03,240
so what's up with that?

1085
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:05,040
Yeah, but see,
we're not different

1086
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,603
amongst a group
of ritzy black folk.

1087
00:53:07,613 --> 00:53:09,138
I mean, we were there...

1088
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:14,646
...to get their business and
to be professional, all right?

1089
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:15,998
We weren't there
to look like a bunch

1090
00:53:16,022 --> 00:53:18,287
of hip hop, multicultural mess.

1091
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:20,316
I mean, Cheryl, look
at what she was wearing.

1092
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:23,496
She's just all weird.

1093
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:27,091
I mean, that dog collar,
her hairstyle, her age.

1094
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:28,431
I just can't get with it.

1095
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,048
Damn, man, that's a good roach,
I wanna save that!

1096
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:35,405
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1097
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:36,568
I'm sorry.

1098
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:40,978
No, thank you.

1099
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:42,641
No, I don't want any.

1100
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:44,981
I'm sorry, Cheryl, okay?

1101
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,462
I guess this stuff
going on with Stacey's

1102
00:53:46,486 --> 00:53:48,011
got me a little bit stressed.

1103
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:49,231
What's up with you and Stacey?

1104
00:53:49,255 --> 00:53:51,417
Nothing.
I mean, she's gone frigid on me.

1105
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:53,358
Zilch.

1106
00:53:53,392 --> 00:53:54,403
Well, don't you think
that Stacey's--

1107
00:53:54,427 --> 00:53:55,656
I don't know what to think.

1108
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:57,129
I mean, listen to me
for a second.

1109
00:53:57,163 --> 00:53:58,240
Don't you think that Stacey is

1110
00:53:58,264 --> 00:53:59,926
A, going to school,

1111
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:01,457
B, working all the time,

1112
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,266
and C, you know,
might just be stressed out?

1113
00:54:04,303 --> 00:54:05,532
I mean, what do you expect?

1114
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:07,540
A little nookie once in a while.

1115
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:09,118
Okay, we've been going out
for a while now

1116
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:10,586
and I don't even have
a key to her place.

1117
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,476
- Really?
- Yeah.

1118
00:54:12,512 --> 00:54:14,344
Diana gave me the keys
to her place last week.

1119
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,958
I did not invite you
over here to talk about

1120
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:17,575
your wannabe black girlfriend.

1121
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:19,586
Tamara, Diana doesn't
want to be black.

1122
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,645
I mean, I'm getting into her,
can't you see that?

1123
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:24,020
All I see is that once again
you are going out

1124
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:26,321
with a white girl acting
like she wants to be black

1125
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:28,670
and you are being a black girl
acting like she wanna be white.

1126
00:54:28,694 --> 00:54:30,185
I mean,
what's up with you, Cheryl?

1127
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:31,573
You don't like the color
of your skin nowadays?

1128
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:33,498
Tamara, I'm black;
I mean, who's to say

1129
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,502
that dating somebody white
doesn't make me black?

1130
00:54:35,535 --> 00:54:38,437
I mean, who's to say
anything about who I fuck

1131
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:40,303
in the goddamn
first place, okay?

1132
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:43,605
Well, Stacey says she thinks
Diana's into chocolate.

1133
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:45,643
I mean, come on, Cheryl,
she lives in that big loft

1134
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:48,238
all by herself and volunteers.

1135
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:50,045
"Volunteers."

1136
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,573
At, like, some agency
that works with

1137
00:54:51,617 --> 00:54:54,052
not only poor kids
but poor black kids.

1138
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:55,281
What's up with that, Cheryl?

1139
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,381
Tamara, you're
just so fucked up.

1140
00:54:57,423 --> 00:54:59,415
- You're just so fucked up.
- See?

1141
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,087
- I'm sick of you. God.
- Hey.

1142
00:55:03,696 --> 00:55:06,165
Hey, Cheryl, there were
all these mad cuties there.

1143
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:08,043
You should have been there,
it was a really fun place.

1144
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:10,127
Hey, look, Cheryl.
They set up dyke archives

1145
00:55:10,169 --> 00:55:11,513
I was telling you about
in New York.

1146
00:55:11,537 --> 00:55:12,470
- Oh, wow.
- I went there when I went

1147
00:55:12,505 --> 00:55:13,545
to that rave last weekend.

1148
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:15,303
Oh, great.

1149
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,686
So you're gonna go
all the way to New York

1150
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,150
to find out that
they only have stuff

1151
00:55:19,178 --> 00:55:20,669
on white lesbians,
right, Cheryl?

1152
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:22,090
Actually, you know, Tamara,
there's a really great

1153
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:23,412
black lesbian collection.

1154
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:25,475
- See, there it is.
- Oh, wow, here it is.

1155
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:27,496
- Really good for your project.
- Yeah, she's right.

1156
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,489
They have a whole
black lesbian collection.

1157
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:31,500
- You're so helpful.
- Hey, no problem, and, you know,

1158
00:55:31,524 --> 00:55:33,049
I'm going up there
next weekend too.

1159
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:34,570
If you need a ride,
I can give you one.

1160
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:35,755
You're so helpful, Annie.

1161
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:37,161
I mean, you probably
know a place

1162
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:39,427
to get a good
clit piercing, don't ya?

1163
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:41,331
Tamara, why don't
you lay off her, okay?

1164
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,212
- What's it to you?
- Don't worry about it, Cheryl,

1165
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:44,534
she's just jealous.

1166
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,232
Oh, right.

1167
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:48,016
Look, Tamara, just because
you and I are different

1168
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,219
doesn't mean you have to
treat me like shit all the time.

1169
00:55:50,243 --> 00:55:52,735
I'm sorry, did I hurt
your poor little feelings?

1170
00:55:52,778 --> 00:55:54,337
You suck.

1171
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,780
Hear that, Cheryl? I suck.

1172
00:55:56,816 --> 00:55:59,217
- What is the problem here?
- Oh, nothing.

1173
00:55:59,252 --> 00:56:02,086
Um, I'm just here
talking to Tamara

1174
00:56:02,121 --> 00:56:03,350
about the work schedule

1175
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:06,621
'cause I'm gonna go
to the archives

1176
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:08,252
with Annie on Friday

1177
00:56:08,294 --> 00:56:09,705
and she's gonna work for me,
right, buddy?

1178
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:11,664
Yup, and Cheryl--
we worked it out--

1179
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:15,395
Cheryl is gonna work for me
both Saturday and Sunday.

1180
00:56:15,434 --> 00:56:17,300
Right, buddy?

1181
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:18,714
Well, Heckle and Jeckle,
it doesn't matter to me

1182
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:20,172
who is working for who

1183
00:56:20,206 --> 00:56:23,301
as long as you remember
we open late Sunday.

1184
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:24,401
Are they giving you grief?

1185
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:26,105
No, don't worry about it, Bob.

1186
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,823
All right, are you learning
the Bob system?

1187
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:30,112
Bob, I've been here
for months now.

1188
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:31,310
Time does fly, doesn't it?

1189
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:34,479
Yeah, Bob, time does fly

1190
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,580
and people do change.

1191
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:02,409
Hey, sister, how ya doin'?

1192
00:57:02,448 --> 00:57:04,440
You, uh, been to
the archives before?

1193
00:57:04,483 --> 00:57:06,577
Psst, Annie, uh-uh,

1194
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:08,315
leave the sister alone.

1195
00:57:08,354 --> 00:57:09,754
Come over here
and work the camera.

1196
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,135
I think it's about time
we, you know, get started.

1197
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:14,422
I think MJ is ready for us.

1198
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,484
All right.

1199
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,494
Welcome to the Center

1200
00:57:21,534 --> 00:57:25,369
for Lesbian Information
and Technology.

1201
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:27,134
Actually, we're
very disorganized here

1202
00:57:27,173 --> 00:57:29,117
but it's because we're just
a volunteer-run collective

1203
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,752
and you know how hard it is,
things take time.

1204
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:33,143
But, you know, someday
we're gonna have a great system

1205
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,556
where people are
gonna donate materials

1206
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,724
and then they're
gonna be logged,

1207
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:36,716
they're gonna be categoried,

1208
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:37,580
they're gonna be sorted,

1209
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:39,278
they're gonna be stored.

1210
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:41,651
But right now
they're just in boxes.

1211
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:44,748
Well, um, I came to find out
about the black collection

1212
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,452
on lesbians.

1213
00:57:46,492 --> 00:57:48,324
Is that a separate collection
or...?

1214
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:50,353
It's very separate.

1215
00:57:50,396 --> 00:57:52,422
We received a very generous gift

1216
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:54,696
from the Foundation

1217
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:56,703
but they wanted it to be used
exclusively

1218
00:57:56,736 --> 00:57:58,602
for African American lesbians

1219
00:57:58,637 --> 00:58:00,849
so if we have any photographs
that there are white people in,

1220
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:02,466
we just cross them out.

1221
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:04,443
Now come with me
and I'll show you the files.

1222
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:08,340
For example, you might find
this very interesting.

1223
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:10,316
Now, here we have--
let's see--

1224
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:11,526
all kinds of
really great things.

1225
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,815
Oh, look.
Here's a map.

1226
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:15,879
This is a map
of the most popular

1227
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:17,685
lesbian and gay hot spots
of Manhattan

1228
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:18,850
in the '20s and '30s.

1229
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:21,417
- It's just incredible.
- Wow.

1230
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,326
Hm, looks like there were
more dyke bars then

1231
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:24,660
than there are now.

1232
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:27,565
Actually, there were no
exclusively female bars.

1233
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,296
It was mostly mixed speakeasies

1234
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:31,304
and then the young
white debutante crowd.

1235
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:32,814
You know, they'd race uptown
at midnight

1236
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:36,434
for a big plate
of yardbirds and strings.

1237
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,943
What?

1238
00:58:37,977 --> 00:58:40,947
Fried chicken and spaghetti.

1239
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,711
And then they'd wash it all down
with a big, cold,

1240
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:47,948
frosty glass of
100 proof iced tea.

1241
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:49,546
Doesn't that sound great?

1242
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:51,250
I'd really like to
have one right now.

1243
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,634
I mean, you know,
I'm in recovery and everything

1244
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:53,835
but there's nothing wrong
with remembering

1245
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:55,350
the way things used to be.

1246
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:58,262
Well, anyway, let's just
keep it anonymous.

1247
00:58:58,297 --> 00:59:00,789
Um, do you have anything
on black lesbians,

1248
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:02,301
say, in Philadelphia?

1249
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:03,529
Yes, we do!

1250
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:05,401
We have a whole box.

1251
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:08,884
Now, let me just show you--

1252
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:11,309
Whoa, baby.
Thank you, MJ.

1253
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:12,902
Well, this is
a little disorganized

1254
00:59:12,945 --> 00:59:15,471
'cause, you know, we are
an all volunteer collective

1255
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:16,914
and these things take time.

1256
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:18,549
But there's a lot of
fascinating material

1257
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:20,678
and I hope you'll
enjoy yourself.

1258
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,322
These are photos
of The Watermelon Woman,

1259
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:34,697
Fae Richards!

1260
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:37,935
Oh my God.

1261
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,310
Look, it says, "To June Walker,
a special friend."

1262
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:45,936
Get that, Annie, get that.

1263
00:59:45,978 --> 00:59:48,880
Excuse me, you do not have
permission to photograph this.

1264
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:50,507
This is confidential.

1265
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:52,040
This is a safe space.

1266
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,877
Yes, yes, I'm very sorry.

1267
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:56,013
Um, but I'd like
to find out how--

1268
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:58,320
like, can I find out
who donated the stuff?

1269
00:59:58,357 --> 00:59:59,701
I have to discuss it
with the collective.

1270
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,421
We meet every other month.

1271
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,705
And if we come to consensus,
I'll call you and let you know.

1272
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:04,729
- Okay.
- In the meantime,

1273
01:00:04,763 --> 01:00:05,958
respect your sisters.

1274
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:08,399
Yes, sisters.

1275
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:10,027
R-E-S.

1276
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:12,402
But this has to be documented,

1277
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:13,736
I'm sorry.

1278
01:00:15,941 --> 01:00:17,500
Get it, Annie, get it all.

1279
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:19,569
This is great,
I'm so glad we're here.

1280
01:00:19,612 --> 01:00:22,047
- Aren't you glad we came?
- I am so glad we came.

1281
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:23,481
Get it all.

1282
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:25,747
I told you this was
confidential!

1283
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:27,082
Give me that!

1284
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:35,521
It's time to go.

1285
01:00:35,561 --> 01:00:36,790
We got all we need.

1286
01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:38,388
Great, Annie, let's go.

1287
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:44,913
Looks like I'm not
the only one interested

1288
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,337
in this stuff.

1289
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:48,432
A new book on Hollywood lesbians

1290
01:00:48,474 --> 01:00:49,965
has appeared at Giovanni's Room,

1291
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:51,568
our lesbian and gay bookstore,

1292
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:55,342
and <i>Hollywood Lesbians...</i>

1293
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:59,008
...by Doug McKeown.

1294
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:00,576
I wonder if he's a lesbian.

1295
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,021
Anyway, there's a section
on director Martha Page

1296
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:06,423
and Fae's name comes up.

1297
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,984
I wanna show you this picture

1298
01:01:09,028 --> 01:01:10,758
'cause this is the killer.

1299
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,765
"Some folks even say
that she was once

1300
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,598
head over heels in love
with The Watermelon Woman

1301
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:18,433
who starred as the help

1302
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,962
in most of these early
1930 women's films."

1303
01:01:22,007 --> 01:01:24,533
I wonder what kinda help
she offered.

1304
01:01:24,577 --> 01:01:27,376
I wonder if Fae was into Martha

1305
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:28,904
or Martha was into Fae.

1306
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:31,948
Hm, you know?

1307
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,476
I just think that Fae
had to have something else

1308
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,564
going on in her life, you know?

1309
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:37,614
Something more--
somebody else.

1310
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,792
What you're watching now
is footage from an interview

1311
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:48,960
Diana arranged
with Mrs. Page-Fletcher,

1312
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:50,902
Martha's younger sister.

1313
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:53,167
The whole thing
was quite disturbing.

1314
01:01:53,405 --> 01:01:56,569
First, she started
by describing Fae all wrong.

1315
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:58,134
She started talking shit
about Fae

1316
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:00,612
and all those "coloreds"
her sister employed.

1317
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,148
If that wasn't bad enough,

1318
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,651
she made it seem like
Fae was just another actress

1319
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:07,653
her sister Martha
had worked with.

1320
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:08,949
She said...

1321
01:02:08,988 --> 01:02:11,116
Martha was doing
very well in Hollywood

1322
01:02:11,156 --> 01:02:14,593
and she encouraged
some of her former cast

1323
01:02:14,627 --> 01:02:18,428
to come to audition
for her new picture.

1324
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:19,762
My story's all wrong.

1325
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:22,711
You're not trying to infer
that something went on

1326
01:02:22,735 --> 01:02:23,930
between the two of them?

1327
01:02:23,969 --> 01:02:26,165
Cheryl's doing
a video documentary

1328
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,731
about Fae Richards
who was in--

1329
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:31,869
And who was lovers
with your sister.

1330
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:35,677
My sister was not
that kind of woman.

1331
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:37,512
I've told every writer--

1332
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:38,949
I think Diana knew what was up

1333
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:41,544
but she kept quiet
most of the time.

1334
01:02:41,587 --> 01:02:43,920
I wasn't gonna be quiet, no way.

1335
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:46,221
I went off on that old woman.

1336
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,926
Come on, Mrs. Page-Fletcher.

1337
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,124
Look, we know that Martha
and Fae were intimate.

1338
01:02:52,931 --> 01:02:56,129
What? Have I, um, you know,
scared you with some truth?

1339
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:59,002
I mean, come on, everybody
knew that Martha was that way.

1340
01:02:59,038 --> 01:03:00,836
I mean, every book
and every article I read

1341
01:03:00,873 --> 01:03:02,034
has said this fact.

1342
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:03,098
Cheryl.

1343
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:04,804
It got messy after that.

1344
01:03:04,843 --> 01:03:06,869
She asked us to leave.

1345
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:09,541
I can't believe
she was so oblivious

1346
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:13,109
to the fact that her sister
was lovers with this woman.

1347
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:15,621
I mean, come on!

1348
01:03:15,654 --> 01:03:17,919
It was almost like
Fae never existed.

1349
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:21,620
Is there some problem, ma'am?

1350
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,958
This is a mess.

1351
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:24,156
Excuse me.

1352
01:03:24,196 --> 01:03:25,994
Cheryl.

1353
01:03:26,031 --> 01:03:27,590
Mrs. Page-Fletcher,
I'm sorry.

1354
01:03:36,575 --> 01:03:38,703
What's that, uh,
"The Sound of Music"?

1355
01:03:38,744 --> 01:03:40,940
No, silly, it's
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

1356
01:03:42,147 --> 01:03:44,207
- Sing another one.
- I can't just sing something

1357
01:03:44,249 --> 01:03:45,717
off the top of my head.

1358
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:48,721
Oh, come on, I love
the way you sing.

1359
01:03:48,754 --> 01:03:49,949
Okay.

1360
01:03:55,894 --> 01:03:58,261
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where did you learn that one?

1361
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:00,630
Wasn't that the theme song
at your prom?

1362
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:02,157
Diana, darling,
remember I'm black

1363
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:03,999
and the, uh,
theme song at my prom

1364
01:04:04,036 --> 01:04:06,130
was "Sail On" by the Commodores.

1365
01:04:06,171 --> 01:04:08,766
My boyfriend was black
and he knew all the words.

1366
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,140
- You had a black boyfriend?
- I had two.

1367
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:13,771
No, actually, I had three
black boyfriends.

1368
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:15,075
What did your parents say?

1369
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:17,242
Nothing, they're
liberal hippie types.

1370
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:21,310
Actually, my father's
sister's first husband

1371
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:22,714
was an ex-Panther.

1372
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:26,123
His name was Tyrone Washington.

1373
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,751
What is so funny?

1374
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:31,093
You're such a mess, that's all.

1375
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:32,758
What does that mean?

1376
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,795
Nothing.

1377
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,769
I have to go work
on the project.

1378
01:04:37,803 --> 01:04:39,066
The project can wait, Cheryl.

1379
01:04:39,104 --> 01:04:41,335
First tell me what
you meant by that.

1380
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,337
I don't know what I meant.

1381
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:45,635
I just have to go work
on the project, okay?

1382
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:48,873
This project is really
becoming a crutch.

1383
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:51,350
Diana, if you want me to stay,

1384
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,313
you don't have to
mention the project.

1385
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:56,885
Just go.

1386
01:04:56,922 --> 01:04:58,117
I'll talk to you later.

1387
01:05:56,381 --> 01:05:58,213
Looks like one
of our crackhead friends.

1388
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:01,850
What are you doing?

1389
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:03,698
- Just minding my business.
- Minding your business?

1390
01:06:03,722 --> 01:06:05,482
Boy, don't you know
this is private property?

1391
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:06,901
Hey, where'd you get
that camera?

1392
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:08,689
I'm not a boy
and the camera's mine.

1393
01:06:08,727 --> 01:06:10,705
Well, you look like one,
you little crackhead freak.

1394
01:06:10,729 --> 01:06:12,307
- Come up with some ID.
- I don't have any ID.

1395
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:15,301
No ID and possible
stolen property?

1396
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:16,393
Hey.

1397
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:35,176
Hello, is this June Walker?

1398
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,083
I got your name
from the CLIT archives.

1399
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:41,218
My name is Cheryl
and I'm a filmmaker.

1400
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:43,729
Yes.

1401
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:45,754
Yes, I'm a sister.

1402
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:46,992
Yes.

1403
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:52,230
A video project
about Fae Richards' life.

1404
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:54,934
I was wondering if you had
information on her, like--

1405
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:55,973
She's what?

1406
01:06:58,176 --> 01:06:59,906
Oh, yes.

1407
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:05,046
You were together with her
for over 20 years?

1408
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:08,884
Yes, yes.

1409
01:07:10,355 --> 01:07:13,154
Look, do you think I could
come over and talk to you,

1410
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:15,456
maybe even interview you
for this project?

1411
01:07:17,896 --> 01:07:19,057
What?

1412
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:22,062
I used smoked turkey wings

1413
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,035
not pork, why do you ask?

1414
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:28,407
Okay.

1415
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,931
Yes, ma'am.

1416
01:07:29,975 --> 01:07:31,739
Okay, eleven o'clock.

1417
01:07:31,777 --> 01:07:33,040
With lunch in hand.

1418
01:07:34,313 --> 01:07:35,372
Bye.

1419
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,400
If you're looking
for Ms. June,

1420
01:07:56,435 --> 01:07:58,063
she's not there.

1421
01:07:58,103 --> 01:08:00,265
Yeah, I was supposed
to meet her today for lunch.

1422
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:02,137
Oh yeah, she told,
you're the girl who puts,

1423
01:08:02,174 --> 01:08:04,370
um, turkey wings
in her greens, right?

1424
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:06,469
Yeah, yeah, will she
be back soon?

1425
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:08,173
Uh, no, the ambulance
came yesterday

1426
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:09,772
and took her off
to the hospital.

1427
01:08:09,815 --> 01:08:11,078
No!

1428
01:08:11,116 --> 01:08:12,846
- Yeah.
- No, what happened?

1429
01:08:12,884 --> 01:08:15,854
She'd been having, like,
heart pains all this week, so,

1430
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:17,446
I had to go over there and--

1431
01:08:17,489 --> 01:08:19,424
you know, I had to call
the ambulance for her.

1432
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,825
But, um, she told me
to give you something.

1433
01:08:30,102 --> 01:08:32,867
Okay, uh... you gonna
be able to carry that?

1434
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:34,805
Yeah, I got my bags and stuff.

1435
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,433
- Okay.
- But could you take these?

1436
01:08:36,475 --> 01:08:38,307
- No, that's--
- Oh, come on. Please?

1437
01:08:38,343 --> 01:08:41,336
Have you ever tasted greens
with smoked turkey wings?

1438
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,008
No.

1439
01:08:43,048 --> 01:08:44,380
Okay, great, thank you.

1440
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,975
Well, you wanna
come in and join me?

1441
01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:47,316
I can't, I can't.

1442
01:08:47,352 --> 01:08:49,378
Um... do you know
what hospital they took her to?

1443
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,981
No, but she said she's
gonna call me tonight though

1444
01:08:52,024 --> 01:08:53,515
and let me know.

1445
01:08:53,558 --> 01:08:56,494
Well, can you take
my number and, um...

1446
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:59,555
let me know where she is
so I can give her a call, okay?

1447
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,992
And please don't forget
to call me, okay?

1448
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:05,197
All right.

1449
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:06,447
Thank you so much for your help.

1450
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:09,100
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1451
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:10,575
- Enjoy, okay?
- All right.

1452
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,354
Yeah, yeah, it's me.

1453
01:09:28,393 --> 01:09:30,453
You don't sound like yourself.

1454
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,607
Guess what? Stacey and I are
going away for the weekend

1455
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:33,631
to the Poconos.

1456
01:09:33,865 --> 01:09:34,889
Can you work for me?

1457
01:09:36,068 --> 01:09:38,936
I don't know, but, you know,
I went to visit--

1458
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,529
I went to visit
Fae's lover, right?

1459
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:43,041
Yeah, but did you hear
the part about Stacey and me?

1460
01:09:44,376 --> 01:09:46,868
Tamara, you're not
listening to me.

1461
01:09:46,912 --> 01:09:49,074
I went to visit Fae's lover.

1462
01:09:49,114 --> 01:09:51,015
Kool and the Gang, Cheryl,
I heard you.

1463
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:56,113
Anyway, her name is June
and she was in the hospital

1464
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:59,056
and I went there
and it was just fucked up,

1465
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:00,559
just totally fucked up, man.

1466
01:10:00,592 --> 01:10:02,151
I just...

1467
01:10:02,194 --> 01:10:03,321
She left me this note.

1468
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:05,023
Read it quick,
Bob's here clocking me.

1469
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:06,463
- Get off the phone.
- All right.

1470
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,592
- Um, just come by the store.
- Tamara.

1471
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,366
Hi, how can I help you?

1472
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:15,271
Do you have
"New York, New York"?

1473
01:10:15,307 --> 01:10:17,276
- Sure.
- No-no, no, no.

1474
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:19,039
Take this to the back.

1475
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:20,568
Can I help you?

1476
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:21,978
I just want to get that movie.

1477
01:10:22,013 --> 01:10:23,276
- Do you want a job?
- Sure.

1478
01:11:00,519 --> 01:11:02,385
"Dear Cheryl,

1479
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,218
you sounded so excited
over the phone

1480
01:11:04,256 --> 01:11:06,054
that I had to write down
some thoughts

1481
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:08,185
before they escaped me."

1482
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:10,252
All that talk about Fae

1483
01:11:10,295 --> 01:11:11,593
and that white woman

1484
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,065
got me to remember
some unpleasant things

1485
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:16,261
about the past.

1486
01:11:16,301 --> 01:11:19,999
Things that upset me
and things that had upset Fae

1487
01:11:20,038 --> 01:11:21,973
when she was alive.

1488
01:11:26,077 --> 01:11:28,979
I was so mad that you
mentioned the name

1489
01:11:29,014 --> 01:11:30,983
of Martha Page.

1490
01:11:31,016 --> 01:11:34,578
Why do you even want
to include a white woman

1491
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:37,453
in a movie on Fae's life?

1492
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:39,424
Don't you know she had
nothing to do

1493
01:11:39,457 --> 01:11:42,689
with how people
should remember Fae?

1494
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:44,696
I think it troubled her soul

1495
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:47,722
for the world to see her
in those mammy pictures.

1496
01:11:52,504 --> 01:11:53,733
She did so much, Cheryl,

1497
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:56,401
that's what you have
to speak about.

1498
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,239
She paved the way
for kids like you

1499
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:00,745
to run around making movies
about the past

1500
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,407
and how we lived then.

1501
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,213
Please, Cheryl,

1502
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:13,248
make our history
before we are all dead and gone.

1503
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:17,057
But if you are really
in the family,

1504
01:12:17,095 --> 01:12:19,030
you better understand
that our family

1505
01:12:19,064 --> 01:12:22,501
will always only have
each other.

1506
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:24,435
I know this is a lot
to be writing down

1507
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,769
but I wanted to remember it
for you now

1508
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:29,672
so that the next time I see you

1509
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:30,801
we can make it right.

1510
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,131
Well, things haven't been going

1511
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:55,395
the way I thought
they'd be going.

1512
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:58,699
Diana and I aren't
Diana and I anymore

1513
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:01,639
and Tamara, girlfriend...

1514
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:04,481
...let's just hope we can
work things out soon.

1515
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:08,611
You know, I thought
it was gonna be easy.

1516
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:10,582
I thought I was gonna be able
to use the camera

1517
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:12,550
to document my search for Fae

1518
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:15,281
but instead
I'm left empty-handed

1519
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,255
except for
this package from June.

1520
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,635
You know, I wish that
neighbor of yours had given me

1521
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:22,355
your phone number
in the hospital

1522
01:13:22,394 --> 01:13:24,659
because there were so many
things I wanted to ask you

1523
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:26,164
face to face.

1524
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,825
I mean, I know she meant
the world to you

1525
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,269
but she also meant
the world to me

1526
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:34,136
and those worlds are different.

1527
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:37,573
But the moment she
shared with you

1528
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:40,443
the life she had with
Martha on and off the screen,

1529
01:13:40,478 --> 01:13:42,276
those are precious moments

1530
01:13:42,314 --> 01:13:43,714
and nobody can change that.

1531
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:47,217
But what she means to me,

1532
01:13:47,252 --> 01:13:48,481
a 25-year-old black woman,

1533
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,216
means something else.

1534
01:13:50,255 --> 01:13:51,314
It means hope,

1535
01:13:51,356 --> 01:13:52,847
it means inspiration,

1536
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,224
it means possibility.

1537
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,728
It means history.

1538
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,799
And most importantly,
what I understand

1539
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,597
is that I'm gonna be
the one who says,

1540
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:07,800
"I am a black lesbian filmmaker

1541
01:14:07,839 --> 01:14:10,138
who's just beginning

1542
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:11,473
but I'm gonna say a lot more

1543
01:14:11,509 --> 01:14:13,307
and have a lot more work to do."

1544
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:15,878
Anyway...

1545
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:17,780
what you all have
been waiting for.

1546
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:20,479
The Biography of
The Watermelon Woman,

1547
01:14:20,518 --> 01:14:24,216
Fae Richards, Faith Richardson.

1548
01:14:37,802 --> 01:14:39,634
The first record of Fae
that I could find

1549
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:41,640
was this photo,
"Faith Richardson,

1550
01:14:41,673 --> 01:14:44,575
winner of the Beechy Beechum
Bicarbonate Jingle Contest,

1551
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:47,443
Philadelphia, 1922."

1552
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:49,357
I know that she worked
as a maid for several years

1553
01:14:49,381 --> 01:14:52,283
and I know that she danced
in the chorus on South Street,

1554
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:54,809
but I'm not sure how
she got into her first film.

1555
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:57,550
She must have met Martha Page
at some club or something.

1556
01:14:57,589 --> 01:14:59,455
This one is stamped,
"Newark Studios"

1557
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:02,256
and on the back it says,
"The Watermelon Woman

1558
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:06,321
and Sandra Vincent
in 'Jersey Girl,' 1931."

1559
01:15:06,364 --> 01:15:08,390
I think this is
Fae's first film with Page.

1560
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:09,901
In fact, I know it is.

1561
01:15:09,934 --> 01:15:11,645
And from what I can tell,
this is the beginning

1562
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:14,537
of their relationship
both on and off the screen.

1563
01:15:23,782 --> 01:15:25,341
Newark Studios' biggest hit

1564
01:15:25,383 --> 01:15:28,842
was the 1933 film
"Louisiana Lady."

1565
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:30,321
Martha scored with this one

1566
01:15:30,355 --> 01:15:31,914
and got her ticket to Hollywood.

1567
01:15:31,956 --> 01:15:33,481
Fae scored too.

1568
01:15:33,525 --> 01:15:35,653
She was signed with
Silverstar Studio

1569
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:37,389
and played in several
of their movies,

1570
01:15:37,429 --> 01:15:39,557
usually as a household maid
or cook.

1571
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:52,400
"Mr. Owen Meets His Match"

1572
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:56,711
with Claude Thornton and
The Watermelon Woman, 1937.

1573
01:15:56,748 --> 01:15:58,614
This was a big year for Fae.

1574
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,984
In 1937, she also starred
in my all-time favorite,

1575
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,955
"Plantation Memories."

1576
01:16:03,988 --> 01:16:07,322
This one's titled,
"Elsie calls on the Lord."

1577
01:16:14,599 --> 01:16:17,398
I wrote to the studio and got
these glamorous photos of Fae

1578
01:16:17,435 --> 01:16:18,903
taken in 1938.

1579
01:16:20,004 --> 01:16:22,439
It looks like she was trying
to bust out of the mammy roles

1580
01:16:22,474 --> 01:16:25,706
but, of course, in 1938,
that couldn't really work.

1581
01:16:25,743 --> 01:16:27,678
Oh, don't cry, missy.

1582
01:16:27,712 --> 01:16:30,409
Master Charles is comin'
back for sure.

1583
01:16:30,448 --> 01:16:32,314
I know he is.

1584
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,875
Do you really think so, Elsie?

1585
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,454
1939's a big year for Fae.

1586
01:16:42,494 --> 01:16:44,338
I don't know what
happened between her and Martha

1587
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:46,763
but she definitely
moved back to Philly.

1588
01:16:46,798 --> 01:16:48,118
She really worked hard
at becoming

1589
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:49,892
the film star she wanted to be.

1590
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:52,927
Fae no longer calls herself
The Watermelon Woman.

1591
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:54,872
In all of her films
at Liberty Studios,

1592
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:56,807
she goes by the name
Fae Richards.

1593
01:17:21,499 --> 01:17:23,832
I am going to hell
but not for being a tramp,

1594
01:17:23,868 --> 01:17:25,346
but for being poor
and living on the streets

1595
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,770
like I've had to do.

1596
01:17:26,804 --> 01:17:29,535
Why can't I be happy
fitting into their world?

1597
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:31,839
God made me this color
and He did it for a reason.

1598
01:17:43,655 --> 01:17:45,886
Fae worked it
at Liberty Studios.

1599
01:17:45,924 --> 01:17:47,654
J. Liberty cast her as a lead

1600
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:49,752
in all kinds of
black-cast films.

1601
01:17:49,794 --> 01:17:52,992
Comedies, melodramas,
and even gangster pictures.

1602
01:17:53,031 --> 01:17:55,762
Problem is, she never got her
chance to be a big star

1603
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,429
because black-cast films
were on their way out.

1604
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:07,669
So, in the '40s,
Fae started singing again

1605
01:18:07,712 --> 01:18:09,010
all over Philly.

1606
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:11,744
At The Standard,
at The Dunbar, Pep's.

1607
01:18:11,783 --> 01:18:13,149
She had quite a following.

1608
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:23,986
The next picture I have of her
is not until 1957

1609
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:25,828
and it's kinda sad to see
what happened to her

1610
01:18:25,863 --> 01:18:28,628
because it looks like
she stopped performing.

1611
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:30,134
But it's also kinda good

1612
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:32,728
'cause she met June Walker,
a special friend,

1613
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:34,796
who took care of her
until the day she died.
