00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,273
It's damp.

6
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,312
The air smells like a graveyard.

7
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:04,475
For six months I've been smelling
my own grave.

8
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:06,805
Hey, Chudra!

9
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,926
Why did you leave our camp?

10
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:16,169
Gypsies are no longer
what they used to be.

11
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,249
They give away a horse for gold.

12
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,325
They'll give away their knife,
and even their soul.

13
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,696
Tell me, Chudra, who knows more,

14
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,319
the fool or the wise man?

15
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,358
The fool.

16
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:35,605
The wise man doubts everything.

17
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,060
Then blessed are the fools, Chudra.

18
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:44,261
Too much knowledge
only brings sorrow.

19
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:47,923
What would you say to me if this
were to be our last meeting?

20
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,171
Do not love gold,
it will betray you.

21
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:55,705
Do not love women,
they will betray you.

22
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,908
Freedom is the headiest
wine of all.

23
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,611
Rise always at the break of day.

24
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,898
Remember, the sunset falls
when you don't expect it.

25
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,600
I wish you long life, Zobar.

26
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,221
Let your death come in time.

51
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,337
Four kings.

52
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:52,991
To the new, twentieth, century,
gentlemen!

53
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:54,823
- To your health.
- Thank you.

54
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,654
- Schwabb!
- Yes, Lieutenant?

55
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:58,360
Can you dance the waltz?

56
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,232
No, I can't, Lieutenant.

57
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,812
Place your right hand
on my left shoulder.

58
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,477
Yes, sir.

59
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:51,963
- Propertsium.
- Yes, sir?

60
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,836
What will be the 20th century like?

61
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:57,456
Everything seems to be confused.
The Zodiac signs are contradictory.

62
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,078
The end of the world will come
in 16 years.

63
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,606
Mister Balint!

64
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,270
- What is it?
- Look!

65
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,724
Are you in your right mind?
Couldn't you wait until tomorrow?

66
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,930
I couldn't. Last night I set a trap

67
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,805
to see what the new year
will be like.

68
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:00,465
I know now that it will be
a magnificent year! Look!

69
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:02,296
Mister Balint,

70
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,958
on this side of the Carpathians
you won't find horses like these.

71
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,206
Nor on the other side.

72
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:09,995
Some light.

73
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,781
Let's have some light.

74
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,736
I don't take government horses.

75
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,232
- What about the others?
- I said, no government property.

76
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:24,187
It's up to you, my dear.

77
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,642
Tomorrow we'll take them
to the fair in Seget

78
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,724
and sell them for pure gold.

79
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,804
I take those that aren't the army's.

80
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,676
Wait. You still haven't paid
for the last ones we brought.

81
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,921
You're always at my throat.
Give me some time to breathe.

82
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:40,334
I wish to do honest business.

83
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,914
Honest business
selling stolen horses?

84
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,091
I'd like to offer my best wishes
to your honoured guests

85
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,879
and to your family.
May you all live long!

86
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,544
Thank you.

87
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,333
But it's bad luck to start
a new year with old debts.

88
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,851
Let's go.

89
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:39,638
Excuse us.

90
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,053
You wait here.

91
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:03,279
- Do you like me?
- Not much.

92
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:14,498
Come back at Easter
and I'll pay you the rest.

93
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,166
All right.

94
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,252
Don't be angry. You've got
the finest Bessarabian racers.

95
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,379
They're priceless. Farewell!

96
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,106
Get down!

97
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,586
Zobar, to the left!

98
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,936
Surround them!

99
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,147
Don't shoot!

100
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,733
I want them alive!
Capture them alive!

101
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:52,071
Run for it!

102
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:58,243
Run for it!

103
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:01,413
Let them have the horses!

104
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:05,000
Let them go! To hell with them!
We'll be caught!

105
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,752
They'll hang us!

106
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,879
Come on, come closer!
Come get me! Come on!

107
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,634
We'll finish up
on the end of a rope.

108
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,720
Hanging high from the oak branches!

109
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:20,930
Leave the horses, Zobar!

110
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:24,475
Leave the horses,
let's get across the Tisza!

111
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,021
Shut up and run for it!

112
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:33,484
You could at least pity the horses,
you Gypsy swine!

113
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:37,863
The crows will pick out
my violet eyes!

114
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:42,993
You'll be hanged!

115
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:45,870
- You will be hanged yourself!
- We'll hang you by your feet!

116
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,539
You'll have to catch me first!

117
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:50,041
Now run for it! Quick!

118
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,381
We'll go this way!

119
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,735
Son of a bitch!

120
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:09,119
After them!

121
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,594
This is the end of a Gypsy boy!

122
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,374
Who are you?

123
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:35,836
My… name is…

124
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,381
Zobar.

125
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,846
And what is… this?

126
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:49,473
Turn around.

127
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,352
It's moon dust.

128
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,648
As a child I drank moon dew.
Bullets have no power over me.

129
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,608
So I've seen.

130
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:27,675
Lower your left arm.
The pain will pass into the earth.

131
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:31,554
Where do you come from?

132
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,432
Galicia. Last night
we crossed over the Carpathians.

133
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:39,769
They're covered with snow. Here,
on the Tisza, there's still summer.

134
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:48,639
Close your eyes.

135
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,739
Everything will pass.

136
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,377
Where are you?

137
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,423
Where are you?

138
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,639
Where are you?

139
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:32,647
Oh, look at that!

140
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:34,805
It's Zobar, Zobar's back

141
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:37,056
Zobar is back!

142
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:42,890
You keep wandering around the world.
You've forgotten us.

143
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,929
Welcome back Zobar!

144
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,634
Rusalina! Wake up, you little fool!

145
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,971
Zobar is here with presents for you.

146
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,728
Luiku.

147
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:29,619
Do you think I've gotten pretty?

148
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:32,288
Pretty as death.

149
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,469
And our mama, was she beautiful?

150
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:53,016
She was so beautiful that the women
chased her from the villages.

151
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:57,228
Whenever they saw her,
they made the sign of the cross.

152
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:01,189
There was no other Gypsy
that could compare to her beauty.

153
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,609
- Then I'm beautiful, too.
- How do you know?

154
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:05,953
Everyone always says,

155
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:08,372
Rusalina's the picture
of her mother.

156
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:11,708
I'll find a master painter.

157
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,087
You'll be the model for a portrait
of our mother in miniature.

158
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,341
Greetings, father.

159
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:29,516
People say that you have
acquired great knowledge.

160
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:33,436
They say you know Russian,
as well as German,

161
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,355
Polish, and Rumanian, too?

162
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,526
That's right, father.
That's true.

163
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,403
And I only know…

164
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,947
how to read men's faces.

165
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,742
Do you think that's easier?

166
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:51,661
Not at all, father.

167
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:55,498
To read men's hearts as you do
is worth far more than books.

168
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,336
On your face
I see the shadow of death.

169
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,337
Send it away.

170
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,925
I only wish I could.

171
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:11,012
How many horses
have died under you?

172
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,514
Three.

173
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:16,308
I gave up after the second one,
and so should you.

174
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:18,644
No, father, I can't. I can't.

175
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:20,771
Get it.

176
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,647
For you.

177
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:26,971
- Thanks.
- I appreciate it, Zobar. Thank you.

178
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:29,931
- Godspeed you, Zobar.
- God bless you.

179
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:34,370
- God be with you, Zobar.
- Take Care

180
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:55,344
Yulishka, how do you manage
never to spill a drop?

181
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,013
I know by hearing where things are.

182
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:01,558
As I know you're coming
by your horse's hoof beats.

183
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:12,693
I drink to you.

184
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,029
And I drink to you.

185
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:41,428
Don't misunderstand me, my friends,
when I come to this house

186
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,015
it is with respect
and affection for you.

187
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,936
You just squander your money,
you rascal.

188
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,771
Your eyes are shining as at a feast.

189
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,358
Aralambi,
turn your back to us, dear.

190
00:23:58,068 --> 00:23:59,403
Face the wall.

191
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,155
Play a lullaby for us.

192
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,325
Yulishka's eyelids are already
heavy with the evening mists.

193
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:07,910
You got no shame, Luiku.

194
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:09,578
You should know

195
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,791
that what is sweet
is always shameless.

196
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,743
I am your wheat field, Zobar,

197
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,827
whose grain you come to harvest
once a year

198
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,581
and leave again.

199
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,336
Are you all right?
You have a fever. Are you ill?

200
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:04,826
No.

201
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,337
I'll bring you some fresh water.

202
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,038
Buy cocks, my beauty.

203
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,499
You're asking too much for them.

204
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:29,636
A Swiss watch, Mister Gypsy,
you won't find one like it.

205
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,096
Listen to that sound!

206
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:45,442
Sweet-smelling hay!

207
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:48,695
Haven't you looked enough?

208
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,488
Beautiful Swiss watches!

209
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:52,740
Everything for you, Madame.

210
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,409
Or maybe for your gentleman?

211
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:58,996
Fine Swiss watches!
Fine Swiss watches!

212
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:04,584
Get your fresh sweet loaf!
Fresh sweet loaf!

213
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,226
Get him away, he eats my hay!

214
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:28,022
Do me now.

215
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:29,732
Me, too.

216
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,443
Ah, Shukar, that is lovely!

217
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:40,112
I can do everything,
but that beats me!

218
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,697
I'm selling it cheap.

219
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,866
Here's a black beauty!

220
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:52,807
This is a young, healthy animal!
Buy a young black horse!

221
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:55,433
He is not young.

222
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,976
Just look at his teeth.

223
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:11,398
- When will you pay your debt?
- You'll get it!

224
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,780
Come, my treasure,

225
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,740
come, my lovely, I will tell you
what your future holds.

226
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:34,574
- A handsome horse.
- An Arabian race horse.

227
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,575
Yeah, I see.

228
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:42,286
Do you remember last year, the horse
I bought from you in Mishkolts?

229
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:44,203
- From me?
- Yes.

230
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,287
Stand still!

231
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:51,706
You died this hack with ink,
bastard! Here, look!

232
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:58,583
I've looked for you
for a whole year, you dog!

233
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,419
Come on, come here.

234
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,089
Come, come here.

235
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:26,095
I'll kill him!

236
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,723
Ah, Gypsies, why should we kill each
other? There aren't many of us left.

237
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,225
All right, calm down, everybody!

238
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,101
Take off that sheepskin!

239
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,894
If I do, I'll be cold.

240
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:50,687
You must clean up our town
and throw out all this riff-raff!

241
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:53,062
Allow us, Officer,
and we'll drive him out...

242
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,523
You can't take
the law into your hands!

243
00:30:55,898 --> 00:31:00,358
He's also a human being, ladies and
gentlemen! He almost bought a watch.

244
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,359
Why, there's the chicken
I thought I'd lost!

245
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:07,402
I would have him whipped here now.
Don't you think I'm right, dear?

246
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:09,862
Of course you are, dear.

247
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:15,739
I'd give you a gold piece
if you'll let him go.

248
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,032
Don't try to sweet-talk to me.
I'm doing my job.

249
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,199
This one should be whipped too.

250
00:31:22,408 --> 00:31:24,242
They're all the same.

251
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:27,452
Who wants to try
giving me the stick?

252
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:29,953
You?

253
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:35,222
Your Honour, if we're not supposed
to steal chickens

254
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:37,247
or steal geese
or a loaf of bread,

255
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:39,706
how are we to live in this world?

256
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43,834
Get out of here!
I don't want to see you anymore!

257
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,042
You'll never see me again.
I'll never forget your kindness.

258
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:48,627
Where are you from?

259
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,169
We came from Galicia.
We just got here.

260
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:56,297
I'm very grateful to you.

261
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,673
Don't steal anymore
chickens or geese.

262
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:01,091
- What should I steal?
- Girls.

263
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:02,757
And horses.

264
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:05,717
And if you can't steal, work.
You dishonour our people.

265
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,510
Would anyone hire me to work,
with a mug like this?

266
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,344
- What's your name?
- Bucha.

267
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:13,512
- Who is your headman?
- Old Nur.

268
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,471
Nemcho Nur?

269
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:17,555
Yeah, he can't seem to die.

270
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:20,306
And who are you?

271
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:21,974
Zobar.

272
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:24,266
Can you remember?

273
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:27,851
Luiku Zobar?

274
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:33,145
May you live for all eternity!

275
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:35,270
Let all your wishes be granted!

276
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:38,980
What a fortunate man I am
to meet Zobar at last!

277
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:41,272
Where have you come from?

278
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:46,358
Come and visit us,
it would give us all such pleasure.

279
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:49,442
Our camp is not very far,
on the banks of the Tisza.

280
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:52,693
You'll like our tribe, they're
the bravest.

281
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:55,736
Only I am a rotten apple.

282
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,572
For you.

283
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:02,531
From my heart.

284
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:08,658
Our girls are
as lovely as icons.

285
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,528
Get out of the way,
you spawn of the devil!

286
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:50,740
Turn back!

287
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:52,449
Let's turn!

288
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:54,409
Go on!

289
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:24,170
You're an extraordinary girl!

290
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:28,338
Good day to you, young ladies.

291
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,340
You look like a smart man, sir.

292
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,092
Only your driver's a fool.

293
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,176
May I apologize for us both?

294
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:41,386
Here's my hand. I'd like you
to tell my fortune if you will.

295
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:44,762
If you wish,
I can tell your name.

296
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,304
What is it?

297
00:35:49,972 --> 00:35:52,139
I see it all here, my Lord.

298
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:55,100
Antal is your name.

299
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,476
You'll have a long life, my Lord,
only I must tell you something.

300
00:36:00,684 --> 00:36:02,727
Your life will be a miserable one,

301
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,228
because the devil of desire
dominates you,

302
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:08,104
but you're made of wax.

303
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:11,189
Have you nothing good to tell me?

304
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:17,566
Tell your driver to give me his whip
and I'll drive for you.

305
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:24,736
Didn't I tell you, my Lord,
that you've got a lot of wax in you?

306
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,904
Apolodor, give her the whip.

307
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,030
- Wait at the inn.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:34,531
Well, ladies, go into the coach.

309
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:36,782
All right, get in.

310
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:51,621
Let's ride!

311
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:44,683
Come and live in my house,
I'll give you everything you want.

312
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,935
And have to bow to all your wishes?

313
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,394
You'd better get lost, my Lord!

314
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,937
Giddap, darlings!

315
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,779
Oh, good afternoon, my Lord.

316
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:27,649
We've just received the most
fabulous models from Paris.

317
00:38:27,983 --> 00:38:31,770
The latest thing in fashion.
Please come right in.

318
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,680
Let me show you, my Lord.

319
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:20,948
Look, my friends,
our honoured guest has arrived!

320
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,285
The day we welcome you,
is the greatest day for us all.

321
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:00,490
Your eyes are
like wells emitting light.

322
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:04,028
Out tribe has grown strong.

323
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,693
Chudra is back with us.

324
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:08,315
We also have Danilo,
a great soldier.

325
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:12,561
He bears scars that show
how bravely he fought.

326
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:16,432
He brought with him
his daughter, Rada.

327
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:19,221
And the sky above our camp

328
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,344
has become brighter than before.

329
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:27,920
Speak to us, Zobar,
words from your heart.

330
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:32,123
When you are gone,
your words will stay with us.

331
00:43:27,753 --> 00:43:30,875
Stay away from her, Brother Luiku,
she'd be the ruin of you.

332
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,205
And nobody will be able
to help you, not even me.

333
00:43:35,837 --> 00:43:38,667
Beware, Zobar, she's a witch.

334
00:44:56,212 --> 00:44:58,875
- Don't you remember me?
- No.

335
00:44:59,209 --> 00:45:01,914
You were in the forest,
your hair was in braids.

336
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,662
No.

337
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,952
You healed me with moon dust,
remember?

338
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:37,460
Giddap! Go on!

339
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:09,967
Rada, I'm made of granite,
like the mountain.

340
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,714
- Good.
- What's good?

341
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,794
Your words are good,
but your lies are bad.

342
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,323
What an old jade you've got!

343
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:30,738
I'll bring you
a beautiful white mare,

344
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:33,276
as fiery and wild as you are.

345
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:41,727
I'm going to be your destruction,
my friend. Your destruction.

346
00:46:56,128 --> 00:46:59,250
I want that white mare.
You can have the rest.

347
00:46:59,957 --> 00:47:04,078
You're lost, Zobar, you're in her
power, that beautiful witch.

348
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,281
Oh, my pretty sweethearts!

349
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:23,162
Where is Zobar?

350
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:27,949
Where's Luiku Zobar? We'll find him
anyway, and we'll hang him.

351
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,989
But that will be tomorrow.

352
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:33,485
And today any one of you
can make money on him.

353
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:35,524
You hear me, Gypsies?

354
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:39,562
One hundred gold pieces for him
alive and fifty for his body!

355
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:45,014
Don't touch His Majesty

356
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:47,594
the Emperor
Franz Joseph the Second.

357
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,134
Please, Your Honour,
don't take him from me.

358
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:54,005
Where is Luiku Zobar?
Where is Zobar?

359
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:58,084
You don't know
where Zobar is either?

360
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:01,664
We'll shoot every last one
of your horses and bears!

361
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,741
Where is Luiku Zobar? You hear,
Gypsies? A hundred pieces of gold!

362
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,739
Don't touch the wheels!

363
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,528
May you burn in hell
together with these wheels!

364
00:49:12,777 --> 00:49:15,025
Don't touch them, I said!
Get out of here!

365
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,563
You just wait! I'll show you
what a Gypsy can do!

366
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,477
So you've got claws,
you stray cat!

367
00:49:20,894 --> 00:49:24,556
Your Honour, don't touch
the Emperor Franz Joseph II!

368
00:49:24,889 --> 00:49:26,512
General,
I'm at your service, sir!

369
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,177
Get out of here!

370
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,008
What are you laughing at, you fool?

371
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:32,924
I'm not a fool,
I am Zobar's sister.

372
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:34,962
You're the fool
to look in the trunk.

373
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:38,375
My name is Rusalina.
I'll see that you remember me.

374
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,165
Where's your brother?

375
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:43,079
You know what, policeman?
I'm gonna steal horses too.

376
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:44,985
- We'll catch you and hang you.
- No way.

377
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,016
- Why not?
- We have drunk the moon dew.

378
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,781
Bullets can't stop us,

379
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:50,962
the forest gives us shelter,
the night saves us.

380
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,777
Sergeant, I've found Napoleon!

381
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:56,066
Look, Sergeant,
I've found Napoleon!

382
00:49:57,772 --> 00:49:59,645
Ready… aim!

383
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:06,887
Don't shoot, please, Sergeant,
you must not do this!

384
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,552
Don't shoot!

385
00:50:08,885 --> 00:50:11,591
Don't shoot!
I'll give you my son.

386
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:15,548
I'll give you Luiku Zobar.

387
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:35,346
Why did they do that?

388
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:43,890
We came too late. They're gone.

389
00:51:09,523 --> 00:51:10,857
Who are they?

390
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:14,149
Are they crazy or what?

391
00:51:14,566 --> 00:51:16,901
No, brother, they're artistes.

392
00:51:27,188 --> 00:51:30,648
I asked around.
The camp left two days ago.

393
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:33,273
They were seen heading for
the mountains.

394
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:36,149
They seemed to be
going back to Galicia.

395
00:51:36,774 --> 00:51:38,108
All right.

396
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:41,901
You'll go for nothing.

397
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:44,568
Go to Balint.

398
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,944
The money he owes me for
the Bessarabian racers is yours.

399
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,403
Why are you giving everything away
as if you were dying?

400
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:53,155
Share it with Bubulia.

401
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,364
Oh, I'm going to collect everything,
don't worry.

402
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,075
I don't want it, Zobar.

403
00:52:05,908 --> 00:52:08,451
I'm going to Galiсia with you,
all right?

404
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:10,409
No, brother Bubulia.

405
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:17,037
Go and find my people.

406
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:21,913
Give this to my sister.

407
00:52:25,414 --> 00:52:27,498
Take it, brother Bubulia.

408
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:29,749
I give it to you.

409
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:31,833
Let's drink to our farewell.

410
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,626
What is this, brother?
Are you going to die?

411
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:37,899
To our brothership.

412
00:52:44,337 --> 00:52:48,338
Goodbye. When you get enough
of loving, you'll come back.

413
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:54,923
Go now. Go.

414
00:53:34,853 --> 00:53:36,270
My son…

415
00:53:39,937 --> 00:53:41,313
Forgive me.

416
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:52,900
- Are you Luiku Zobar?
- Yes.

417
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:57,241
You're under arrest.
Put your hands on your head.

418
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,778
Stand up.

419
00:54:02,694 --> 00:54:04,404
Just a second, you haven't paid.

420
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:09,905
All right,
you can keep my horse till I return.

421
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:11,614
Good enough.

422
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,156
Offer my respects to the young lady
and give her the dress.

423
00:54:17,366 --> 00:54:18,700
Yes, sir.

424
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,919
A gift for you from my master.

425
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:56,670
Get up please, my dear.

426
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,795
Come on, rise!

427
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:04,839
Will you give me your daughter,
Danilo?

428
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:06,839
I'll pay. I'll give you whatever you
want.

429
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:09,132
Only rich men buy
and sell everything,

430
00:55:09,465 --> 00:55:11,175
from pigs to their own souls.

431
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,342
You insolent nobody!

432
00:55:13,717 --> 00:55:16,593
Why do you have dealings with
a nobody like me, your honour?

433
00:55:16,926 --> 00:55:20,719
I'm sorry, soldier, I didn't mean
to offend you or your daughter.

434
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:22,553
Old habits die hard.

435
00:55:23,095 --> 00:55:25,845
I came to you, Gypsy,
with my respect. And you?

436
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,971
Where's your generosity, soldier?

437
00:55:29,346 --> 00:55:32,847
I have no generosity, my Lord,
I have nothing.

438
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:36,640
I have only my daughter, Rada.

439
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:39,141
Nothing else!

440
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:43,893
Listen to me, my Lord,
I do have a favour to ask you.

441
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,102
Whatever you want.

442
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,145
Anything?

443
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:50,812
- Anything.
- You swear?

444
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:53,438
I swear.

445
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:55,646
I want Bucha to put on the dress.

446
00:55:57,022 --> 00:55:59,272
Go on, Bucha, put it on!

447
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:31,866
I'm sorry, my Lord.

448
00:56:41,661 --> 00:56:43,995
Come to my house tomorrow.

449
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:46,662
I invite you all. We will talk.

450
00:56:48,663 --> 00:56:52,372
Here, soldier. It will come handy.
My name is Antal Siladi.

451
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,249
Bucha, go return his money.

452
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,834
Quickly!

453
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,500
Why?

454
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:04,168
Get out of my sight!

455
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:05,877
Excuse me for my audacity, my Lord.

456
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:08,253
You seem to be a kind and good man.

457
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,004
Don't come here again,
stay away from these people.

458
00:57:14,546 --> 00:57:17,088
You can see that they only
know how to speak with knives.

459
00:57:43,847 --> 00:57:45,764
My son, Almighty God
has commanded us

460
00:57:46,098 --> 00:57:48,515
to work for the salvation of souls.

461
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:53,350
But it is not here on earth that
the sinner may find his redemption.

462
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,060
You've eaten the bread of the outlaw
and drunk the wine of stealing.

463
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:03,228
Do you know, Father,
how delicious stolen wine tastes?

464
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:05,020
Who are you?

465
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:07,187
A devil or simply a foolish child?

466
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:08,855
I am Zobar.

467
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:12,523
The greatest horse thief
in the world, Father.

468
00:58:13,898 --> 00:58:16,940
Is there anything more you'd like
to say?

469
00:58:19,192 --> 00:58:22,233
I wish I could bid farewell
to my people.

470
00:58:22,943 --> 00:58:26,444
Stroke my horses and spit on them
to protect myself from the evil eye.

471
00:58:26,777 --> 00:58:29,611
I wish I had a little
of that stolen wine to drink.

472
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:34,196
May God in heaven save his soul.

473
00:58:36,155 --> 00:58:38,572
And the body too, Father.

474
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:40,448
Pray to the Lord to save me

475
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:43,449
and I'll bring you
the best horse in the world.

476
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,953
- Shall I open up?
- Yes, do it.

477
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:17,709
Greetings, brother Balint!

478
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:25,920
I've come to get the money
you owe us, sir.

479
00:59:26,754 --> 00:59:28,213
If you'll forgive my intrusion.

480
00:59:29,046 --> 00:59:30,380
That I owe you?

481
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:32,797
That's right, your honour.

482
00:59:33,214 --> 00:59:36,507
An old debt,
brother Balint, very old.

483
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:40,258
You're no brother to me,
remember it.

484
00:59:40,925 --> 00:59:42,467
Don't get angry.

485
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:45,469
Zobar's gone away
and he sent me for the money.

486
00:59:45,802 --> 00:59:48,928
I was not dealing with you, and
I'm not going to settle it with you.

487
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:55,013
Why are you so rude, brother Balint?

488
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:00,723
You should've asked me into your
house, offered me some wine.

489
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,765
It's no time to be drinking wine.

490
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:05,058
You know, brother Balint,

491
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:09,351
unless you pay up,
I'll take the horses back.

492
01:00:10,226 --> 01:00:14,018
I can easily sell them to Rumanians
or Guzuls across the river.

493
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:17,770
Perhaps you can even lose some
of your own. That's the man I am.

494
01:00:21,562 --> 01:00:23,105
Go on, take them.

495
01:00:23,272 --> 01:00:25,647
Oh, what a mistake, my Lord!

496
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,648
There they are, my darlings.

497
01:00:28,981 --> 01:00:31,941
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

498
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:34,025
There you are, my sweethearts!

499
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:36,942
I'm gonna get married now,
with a dowry like this.

500
01:00:37,275 --> 01:00:39,110
My lovelies!

501
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:40,985
Let's go home.

502
01:00:41,653 --> 01:00:42,986
There you are…

503
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:44,653
Come along…

504
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:48,737
What are you doing, sons of a…

505
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:01,700
Keep him hidden, and tonight
throw him in the Tisza.

506
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:40,772
Aren't you glad to see me?

507
01:02:43,232 --> 01:02:45,732
Good day, Gypsies.

508
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:48,649
An honoured guest is always
welcome here.

509
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:00,106
Welcome, my Lord.

510
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:02,690
Good people!

511
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:06,565
I speak to you as to my peers.

512
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:10,523
My conscience is clear
before God and you.

513
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:13,732
Let Rada marry me.

514
01:03:14,232 --> 01:03:16,899
I'll share all with you, everything
I own!

515
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,690
I'm very rich, Danilo.

516
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:22,440
Why don't you say something,
old men?

517
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,231
Speak, daughter, what's your answer?

518
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:32,356
He's waiting!

519
01:03:32,815 --> 01:03:34,898
You're welcome, my Lord.

520
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:38,315
Think about it, my Lord.

521
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,357
Your nest is for
doves and birds of prey.

522
01:03:42,523 --> 01:03:44,898
What will I be
if I enter your nest?

523
01:03:46,149 --> 01:03:47,482
I've given it a lot of thought,

524
01:03:47,732 --> 01:03:49,274
before I came here
for the third time.

525
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,899
It would be better
if you didn't come.

526
01:03:52,398 --> 01:03:54,731
I wish you a long and happy life.

527
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:01,065
- Where are you going?
- To the end of the world, my Lord.

528
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:05,315
- Why?
- To go there and come back.

529
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,065
What kind of people are you?
What do you want?

530
01:04:11,398 --> 01:04:14,482
Nothing, my Lord.
Nothing but the road.

531
01:04:16,149 --> 01:04:17,482
Let's go!

532
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:23,023
Don't take it too hard, my Lord.
Time will heal all.

533
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:28,773
May you burn in hell!

534
01:04:29,273 --> 01:04:30,648
Let the devil's fires

535
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:34,273
spoil your beauty and your life!

536
01:04:34,898 --> 01:04:36,231
Burn in hell!

537
01:04:54,606 --> 01:04:56,106
Pardon this sinner, heavenly Father.

538
01:04:56,231 --> 01:05:00,565
I wish we had the drummers here,
in gold doublets, as in olden times.

539
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,606
I recall a hanging in Magdeburg.

540
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,606
That was a real spectacle!
It was unforgettable!

541
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:07,523
Almost like a coronation.

542
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:10,815
We can't begin to compare to it.
What we're doing is vulgar!

543
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:14,398
We're in the provinces, gentlemen.

544
01:05:14,732 --> 01:05:18,147
They don't even know
how to strangle a man here.

545
01:05:18,439 --> 01:05:20,398
They write anonymous letters

546
01:05:20,898 --> 01:05:23,648
full of errors in every line.

547
01:05:24,856 --> 01:05:29,315
The local beauties here smear
goose fat over their hair.

548
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:38,232
Mister Mayor,
shall we read the sentence?

549
01:05:38,732 --> 01:05:40,357
To whom? It's just a waste of time.

550
01:05:40,523 --> 01:05:44,272
It's not Copernicus,
it's only a miserable horse thief.

551
01:05:46,231 --> 01:05:47,814
Let me through!

552
01:05:48,606 --> 01:05:51,356
Mister Mayor, please pardon him!

553
01:05:51,523 --> 01:05:53,481
I beg you, Mister Mayor!

554
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:55,606
- Take her away!
- Have pity!

555
01:05:56,314 --> 01:05:57,939
No! No!

556
01:05:58,439 --> 01:06:01,023
Please, have mercy!
Pardon him!

557
01:06:01,606 --> 01:06:04,523
Guards, forward march!
One, two!

558
01:06:04,856 --> 01:06:06,856
One two, one two! Left face!

559
01:06:10,148 --> 01:06:11,481
Halt!

560
01:06:34,106 --> 01:06:36,231
Stop sneezing, you idiot!

561
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:40,397
Of course, Mister Mayor!
I promise.

562
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,356
Mercenary dogs!

563
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:00,648
Mister Mayor, I did it for you,

564
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:03,815
because he annoyed you
with his sneezing.

565
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:06,689
Tell them to release me
and I'll do everything myself.

566
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:08,855
All right.

567
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,606
Step back!

568
01:07:12,064 --> 01:07:13,397
Step back!

569
01:07:16,022 --> 01:07:17,731
I'm waiting for your orders.

570
01:07:18,064 --> 01:07:20,522
- Just get it over with quickly!
- Yes, sir.

571
01:07:21,814 --> 01:07:23,648
Come on, my dear, get on with it.

572
01:07:50,481 --> 01:07:52,023
Want some soap?

573
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:55,398
It makes it slide easier.

574
01:07:55,606 --> 01:07:57,231
Save it for yourself.

575
01:07:58,856 --> 01:08:00,356
Look, Mister Mayor.

576
01:08:02,772 --> 01:08:04,730
What is he doing there?

577
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:06,605
I don't know, Mister Mayor.

578
01:08:07,147 --> 01:08:09,730
- How did it get here?
- It's very odd.

579
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:20,856
Get rid of it!

580
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:22,606
Yes, sir.

581
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:25,273
Get rid of that horse.

582
01:08:38,772 --> 01:08:40,772
Shoot!
Don't stand there!

583
01:08:42,939 --> 01:08:44,814
Bubulia, this way!

584
01:08:53,147 --> 01:08:55,231
You fat pigs!

585
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,980
You eat too much!

586
01:08:57,563 --> 01:08:59,438
It spoils your aim!

587
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,272
Thank you, heavenly Father!

588
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:14,064
Save my sinful soul.

589
01:09:38,522 --> 01:09:39,855
Bubulia!

590
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:45,189
Bubulia…

591
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:28,605
Zobar!

592
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:35,438
Break it, Chudra.

593
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:00,105
I brought you

594
01:13:00,855 --> 01:13:02,188
the white mare!

595
01:14:11,562 --> 01:14:13,354
Zobar!

596
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:28,105
Look, Zobar, the cards always
say the same thing.

597
01:14:31,104 --> 01:14:32,562
There were four of us.

598
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:36,312
It was as if we held the whole
earth in our hands.

599
01:14:37,354 --> 01:14:40,896
Two of us were killed.
Talimon has vanished into thin air.

600
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:43,354
Now it's my turn.

601
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:46,896
Well…

602
01:14:49,979 --> 01:14:53,021
You see?
I'm always wherever you are.

603
01:14:54,313 --> 01:14:57,395
This is your road
and there you are,

604
01:14:58,395 --> 01:15:02,354
and I am always
crossing your path.

605
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:08,854
That's a fine pipe you have.

606
01:15:11,562 --> 01:15:15,104
A Polish prince gave it to me.
I was like gold, he said.

607
01:15:15,604 --> 01:15:19,729
Yes, you all are. Ready to cut
each other's throats for gold.

608
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,021
Two of your tribe
have come over to ours.

609
01:15:23,313 --> 01:15:26,145
So your good-for-nothings
have got two more.

610
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:34,770
Or maybe it's
because I'm really like gold?

611
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:39,062
Oh, you really love yourself.

612
01:15:42,062 --> 01:15:43,854
Who should I love then, Zobar?

613
01:15:44,604 --> 01:15:47,396
What man will make
my heart vibrate

614
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:51,146
like a fine steel blade?

615
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:59,687
Hey, stop smoking.

616
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:02,062
But why?

617
01:16:02,395 --> 01:16:05,729
There are saints here. You shouldn't
smoke in their presence.

618
01:16:11,854 --> 01:16:14,062
What made them saints?

619
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,479
They suffered a lot.

620
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:19,728
All their lives, understand?

621
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:22,603
I suffer too.

622
01:16:23,353 --> 01:16:25,478
I can't tell you how much I suffer.

623
01:16:27,979 --> 01:16:29,479
So that makes me a saint too.

624
01:17:31,437 --> 01:17:34,645
Zobar, why don't you build a fire
so I can dry my clothes?

625
01:17:47,436 --> 01:17:50,103
Don't look at me that way,
Zobar. Don't look.

626
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:53,687
It will make your head spin.

627
01:19:18,603 --> 01:19:21,228
I've never loved anybody.

628
01:19:23,978 --> 01:19:25,437
But I love you.

629
01:19:37,769 --> 01:19:40,019
And I love liberty, Luiku.

630
01:19:41,936 --> 01:19:44,270
I love it more than you.

631
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,270
But you couldn't live without me,

632
01:19:52,145 --> 01:19:54,020
as I couldn't live without you.

633
01:19:59,978 --> 01:20:02,811
Will you be my body and soul, Luiku?

634
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:08,644
Your words are like clever snares,
Rada.

635
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:13,395
They're spread out all around me.

636
01:20:13,936 --> 01:20:16,686
Wherever I set my foot,
I'm bound to be caught.

637
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:21,270
But what would happen
should I escape your net, Rada?

638
01:20:22,437 --> 01:20:24,353
Perhaps you're blind, Zobar?

639
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:29,727
The earth is covered in nets.

640
01:20:32,602 --> 01:20:34,478
Everybody sets up nets.

641
01:20:35,394 --> 01:20:38,853
Some are subtle and honest,
others crude and brutal.

642
01:20:39,394 --> 01:20:42,228
No one can avoid them.

643
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:47,520
Ah, I'll offer you my lips
and my caresses, Zobar.

644
01:20:48,728 --> 01:20:51,395
Ah, my love will be so sweet.

645
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,145
You'll forget the whole world.

646
01:20:54,353 --> 01:20:56,894
You won't miss those wild
gallops over the plain.

647
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:01,227
Tomorrow you will submit to me
like to your elder.

648
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:05,228
You'll bow down before me
in front of my people.

649
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:08,144
And you'll kiss my right hand.

650
01:21:09,228 --> 01:21:12,229
When you do, I'll become your wife.

651
01:21:13,897 --> 01:21:15,230
And then…

652
01:21:15,897 --> 01:21:17,981
Then we'll have our night.

653
01:21:18,564 --> 01:21:22,442
I will come to you,
naked as a newborn child.

654
01:21:23,275 --> 01:21:25,484
And we shall be reborn together,
Luiku.

655
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,533
Come here.

656
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:50,870
May your love lie heavy
upon your thoughts,

657
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:54,204
and upon your heart
and on the hands that caress me.

658
01:21:55,539 --> 01:21:56,872
Drink!

659
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,904
Don't be afraid of me,
Luiku, don't.

660
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:20,198
I was… I was even more
beautiful than your Rada.

661
01:23:29,618 --> 01:23:31,702
Where is she? Where's Rada?

662
01:23:32,994 --> 01:23:36,913
Your Rada's gone away,
she left, my dear.

663
01:23:37,705 --> 01:23:41,206
They set out at sunrise.

664
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,919
- Why have you stayed?
- I'll wait for the first frost.

665
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:53,295
I must gather herbs,
then I'll join them.

666
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:58,422
Just before winter kills herbs,
their poison is strongest.

667
01:23:59,005 --> 01:24:02,048
- Where did they go?
- Toward the mountain pass.

668
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:05,424
They'll stop in Bucovina
and make camp.

669
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:10,468
Vanity…

670
01:24:11,427 --> 01:24:13,053
It's all vanity.

671
01:24:17,721 --> 01:24:20,597
And your suffering is vain, too.

672
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:25,099
I'll give you a potion,
it will make you stronger.

673
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:27,892
And you'll forget
your love for Rada.

674
01:24:42,397 --> 01:24:43,732
Ah, Zobar…

675
01:24:45,315 --> 01:24:47,608
You'll go there for your death.

676
01:24:58,779 --> 01:25:00,155
What will you have?

677
01:25:00,364 --> 01:25:03,073
Nothing.
I'll rest a little, then I'll go.

678
01:25:03,781 --> 01:25:07,449
Go on, rest if you like.
Everyone only wants to rest today.

679
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:09,700
That cursed Friday.

680
01:25:37,795 --> 01:25:39,421
What's the matter, Zobar?

681
01:25:40,505 --> 01:25:41,881
Why do you look so sad?

682
01:25:42,714 --> 01:25:44,047
Go wash up.

683
01:25:58,011 --> 01:25:59,471
Wake up, man!

684
01:26:03,597 --> 01:26:05,515
Hey, Innkeeper,
fill up four big jugs

685
01:26:05,848 --> 01:26:07,766
with wine and hang them
on my saddle.

686
01:26:08,183 --> 01:26:09,516
Right away, Zobar.

687
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:11,475
Today we're going to celebrate!

688
01:29:20,928 --> 01:29:22,804
Drink, my friends!

689
01:31:33,231 --> 01:31:34,866
Take me to her.
You'll be my best man.

690
01:31:36,817 --> 01:31:38,150
You've forgotten.

691
01:31:38,608 --> 01:31:41,193
I told you to have
three locks on you.

692
01:31:41,526 --> 01:31:45,237
One for your lips, one for your
heart, and one for your thoughts.

693
01:31:47,112 --> 01:31:48,488
They've all been broken.

694
01:31:49,113 --> 01:31:50,572
Take me to her.

695
01:32:10,164 --> 01:32:12,915
I know, Zobar, you've broken
many a wild horse,

696
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,374
only so far they've always
been easy ones.

697
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,375
That's so.

698
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:22,043
You are right.

699
01:32:22,377 --> 01:32:25,461
Listen, Danilo,
a wild horse needs a strong hand.

700
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:27,420
Will you give me your daughter
in marriage?

701
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:31,630
Take her, Zobar, if you can.

702
01:32:41,593 --> 01:32:43,385
No one can escape his destiny.

703
01:32:44,552 --> 01:32:46,094
The fastest horse in the world

704
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:48,720
cannot help you
run away from yourself.

705
01:32:50,555 --> 01:32:52,219
I take you for my wife, Rada,

706
01:32:53,302 --> 01:32:56,422
upon my honour,
before your father,

707
01:32:58,336 --> 01:33:00,334
before all our Gypsy
brothers and sisters.

708
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:04,287
He got a bridle on her!
He's got her! What a man he is!

709
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,409
- You're an idiot!
- Why do you say that?

710
01:33:06,743 --> 01:33:08,243
We'll see
who's got a bridle on whom.

711
01:33:08,407 --> 01:33:11,445
I warn you, Rada,
don't go against my will.

712
01:33:11,653 --> 01:33:13,900
Remember, I was born free

713
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,689
and I will go on living as I will.

714
01:33:50,605 --> 01:33:52,019
Oh, Zobar!

715
01:33:53,475 --> 01:33:57,096
What did you do that for?
It isn't funny, is it?

716
01:33:58,844 --> 01:34:01,050
I think you're safer on horseback.

717
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:03,422
Yes, I think you're right.

718
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:08,082
What are you doing that for, girl?
He's my best friend!

719
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:11,328
- Please help me…
- Get away!

720
01:34:13,368 --> 01:34:15,781
Last night, brothers, I looked

721
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:17,446
into my heart.

722
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:22,897
And I discovered that the old free
life no longer matters to me.

723
01:34:25,186 --> 01:34:26,809
Only Rada matters.

724
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,223
Only she is in my heart.

725
01:34:30,762 --> 01:34:32,926
And so I have decided,
brother Gypsies,

726
01:34:33,925 --> 01:34:35,798
to bow down in front of her,

727
01:34:36,962 --> 01:34:40,999
as she asked me to, to show everyone
that her beauty's conquered Zobar.

728
01:34:41,457 --> 01:34:44,328
I who until now went to any woman
as a stallion goes to a mare.

729
01:34:44,662 --> 01:34:45,993
Ah, Zobar, Zobar…

730
01:34:46,285 --> 01:34:47,658
No, don't go, Chudra.

731
01:34:48,782 --> 01:34:52,651
Stay and watch how Zobar
bows before your Rada.

732
01:34:56,106 --> 01:34:59,102
What a long speech you're making,
Zobar.

733
01:34:59,518 --> 01:35:02,348
Never mind.
Don't be in a hurry.

734
01:35:05,927 --> 01:35:08,714
Now witness this… brothers.

735
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:18,952
Your hand.

736
01:35:23,987 --> 01:35:25,361
Your hand!

737
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:32,477
No, Zobar,
you must bow down before me

738
01:35:33,476 --> 01:35:36,263
and kiss my right hand,
as you promised.

739
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,095
Your hand.

740
01:35:40,217 --> 01:35:41,591
No.

741
01:35:42,547 --> 01:35:43,879
Zobar!

742
01:35:57,279 --> 01:35:58,653
Mama…

743
01:35:58,985 --> 01:36:00,358
Mama…

744
01:36:11,428 --> 01:36:13,300
I knew that…

745
01:36:14,965 --> 01:36:16,339
Danilo!

746
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:18,752
Danilo!

747
01:36:29,114 --> 01:36:30,445
Rada…

748
01:36:33,858 --> 01:36:36,979
I didn't want to…

749
01:39:31,053 --> 01:39:33,425
<i>The End</i>
