35
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,515
It's a foreign dog.

Burn it!

Leaning towards the oppsite
direction and balance

46
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:32,577
- Excuse me

47
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,588
- How can we eat?
- You 'll get used to it.

48
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,783
Look, the foreigners
have no problem with it.

49
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:39,052
Come and sit here

50
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:42,687
It used to take a day
to walk to Canton .

51
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,266
The trees look like they are flying!

52
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,337
Whoops!

53
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,496

Foon, what 's wrong?
What did you say ?

00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,267
Nothing. I--

56
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:59,037
My insides feel strange

57
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,842
You are train sick.
Don 't eat or you 'll throw up .

58
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:08,050
But I want to try Western food

59
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:10,056
We both do . Right, Master ?

60
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,121
Excuse me
We haven 't ordered yet .

61
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,722

63
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,791
It's prepared

64
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,803
How could we know it's fresh?

65
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,339
jesus! The solar eclipse.

66
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,899
Relax . You are overreacting!

67
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:33,241
Aunt 1 3, what 's happening?

68
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:34,941
We are in a tunnel .

69
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:36,505
A tunnel ?

70
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:41,578
We are strong enough
to make a tunnel ?

71
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,450
It's really amazing!

72
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,959
Dumbo

73
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,189
Foon, it's okay to act
like this in front of us .

74
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,359
-Behave yourself when you are in Canton .
-I will.

75
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,428
There'll be many foreigners
at the medical conference

Don 't embarrass us .

I understand Master .

78
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,247
Which hand is mine

79
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:18,447
Fei Hung, have the soup while it's hot .

80
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,291
Foon, you do the same

81
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,666
But I can 't tell which hand
is mine, Master .

82
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,745
Like that ? I can do it.

83
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,017
Sir, are you done with the soup?

84
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,645
I'll finish it after the rice

85
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,923
Only meat? Where's the rice

86
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:54,961
Miss, do you still want the soup?

87
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,462
No, thanks.

88
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,933
Thank you .

89
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,067
Fei Hung, use your knife
and fork to cut the steak.

90
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,572
I know .

91
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,007
Always so clumsy!

92
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:13,636
Don 't play with your food
What a waste

93
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,806
Sorry!

94
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,873
Concentrate on what you are doing.

95
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,682
Watch and learn!

96
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,451
- Aunt 1 3, are you okay ?
- Let me clean it for you .

97
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:28,290
Never mind
Here's your steak.

98
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,956
Don 't play with you food Master !

99
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:32,965
It's all your fault.

100
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,967
Forget it. Let 's eat.

101
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,204
Why are you so quiet ?

102
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,881
I am fine
Why are you so quiet ?

103
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,647
I can 't hold it anymore
Got to--

00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:04,193
- Hold on! We'll be in Canton soon.
- Really?

107
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:05,691
Yes .

108
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,963
Riding in a train
is quite a challenge

109
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,300
Waiter !
I want to take this to go

110
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,636

Why did we give it to Japan
after the wa

119
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:45,535
Taiwan must be near the sea ...

120
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,733
or it wouldn 't be named
after a bay .

121
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,743
I don't even know how large it is.

00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,592
She's Chinese
but wears Western clothes.

00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,103

00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,724
Wait! You haven 't paid yet .

165
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,323
Come back!

166
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,227
Master Wong, I must join them .

167
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,795
Aunt 1 3!

168
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,364
Foon!

169
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,501
Hurry!
The ceremony is about to start !

170
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,069
Hurry up !

171
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,274
We've got a situation
at Telegraph House

172
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:12,986
" Eastern Extension Australasia
And China Telegraph Co."

173
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:14,476
" Eastern Extension Australasia
And China Telegraph Co."

174
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,546
This is the officers' building.
Get out of here

175
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:20,093
Wretched soldiers!
They work for foreigners.

176
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,754
Throw them to their death!

177
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,361
Get out of the way .

178
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,866
Move

179
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,627
Unite with the White Lotus...

180
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,400
and bring peace to our country.

181
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,205
Kill all the foreigners
and we'll live in peace

182
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,104
Burn down Telegraph House

183
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:47,178
Excuse us .

184
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,188
Aunt 1 3, let 's find a good spot .

185
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:52,453
Help me set up the tripod .
just set it over there

186
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:55,620
join the W hite Lotus .

187
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,560
It's starting now .

188
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:01,123
I can 't see a thing.
How can I take pictures ?

189
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,964
Get on my shoulders.

190
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,234
Okay ! Keep still!

191
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:14,072
White Lotus comes to earth
and relieves us from suffering.

192
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,809
The divine power will be with us.

193
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,682
Kill all the foreigners
and we'll live in peace.

194
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:21,345
White Lotus comes to earth...

195
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,321
Foon, this spot is not right.

196
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,483
How wonderful !

197
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:29,428
join the White Lotus.

198
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,021
Kill all the foreigners
and we'll live in peace

199
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:36,365
Protected by the divine power --

200
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,040
What was that ?

201
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:45,544
Excuse us !

202
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:50,579
She can make lightning!
Run for your life!

203
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,882
Go get that witch!

204
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:56,987
The top one or the bottom one?

205
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,991
- The foreigner on top.
- Get her!

206
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:01,986
Wait!

207
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,562
Hold it right there

208
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,333
She's Chinese, not a foreigner .
Look for yourself!.

209
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:09,602
Look at the way you dress.

210
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,570
It proves you are evil.
Get her !

211
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,503
What are you doing?

212
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,939
Aunt 1 3, go
I'll protect you .

213
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,375
Give me back my camera

214
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,043
Where is she

215
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:28,855
Where are you , Aunt 1 3?

216
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:32,585
Foon! Help me
Foon! Help!

217
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:32,859
Kill all the foreigners
and we'll live in peace

218
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:35,453
Kill all the foreigners
and we'll live in peace

219
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,588
Take her back to the shrine
and burn her .

220
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,063
Put her down!

221
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,137
Fei Hung!

222
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:50,734
Who the hell are you to stop me

223
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,173
Tell me your name!

224
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,873
Wong Fei Hung from Fo Shan .

225
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,279
Wong Fei Hung?

226
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,215
I am Leung Foon from Meixian .

227
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,651
He's Wong Fei Hung,
that famous martial artist!

228
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,210
I'll kick you to death.

229
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,410
Leave him alone
Pick on someone else

230
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,609
Which one

231
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:32,675
You 'll hurt him.

232
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,288
Okay , that 's enough.

233
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:39,858
Cross fist!

234
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,855
Thank you , thank you .

235
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:45,258
Master !

236
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,529
-Aunt 1 3, are you all right?
- I'm fine!

237
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:51,537
You came just in time

238
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,701
What 's this? It smells sweet.

239
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,337
She sniffed the sleeping powder.

240
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:00,504
- Foon!
- Yes .

241
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,604
Take care of Aunt 1 3.

242
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,149
Aunt 1 3.

243
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,211
Protected by the divine power ...

244
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:18,760
How dare you claim yourself
messenger of God ...

245
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,823
and bring justice to earth.

246
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,562
Aunt 1 3, wake up!

247
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:24,069
Aunt 1 3!

248
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,173
Foon, carry her back to the inn.

249
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,016
Foon!
What are you waiting for ?

250
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,681
He's one of the best 1 0
martial artists in Canton .

251
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:48,124
Get lost!

252
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:51,887
What 's he doing?

253
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,359
Don 't touch it, Master Wong.
It's evil.

254
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,603
Get lost!

255
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,109
I want to learn
martial arts from you .

256
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:06,111
Go away! Don't follow me.

257
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,058
Fei Hung!

258
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,722
You 're awake

259
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:28,593
You passed out because of
the sleeping powder.

260
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:32,203
- Did you carry me back here
- No

261
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,240
Foon did

262
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,832
Why was he carried me back?

263
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:39,537
He's outside
brewing medicine for you.

264
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,081
Drink the herbal medicine
and get some rest.

265
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,355
- Master Wong.
- Coming.

266
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,083
There are rough types here
Don 't go out alone

267
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,293
Rest a while Don 't worry.

268
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:59,628
I'm fine

269
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:03,567
I can interpret for you at
the medical conference tomorrow .

270
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:07,270
Let 's talk about that later .
Drink the medicine first.

271
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:13,369
- Sorry for the interruption .
- Never mind

272
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,840
You woke up already ?
It was --

273
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,316
It was you who carried me back.

274
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,386
Right.

275
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:25,082
Be careful. The medicine is hot.

276
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:33,564
Mr. Mak ,
do you want to talk to me

277
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:36,466
I asked my employee
to buy these clothes .

278
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,902
Please ask your friend
to wear them .

279
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:40,633
It's very kind of you .

280
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:43,039
Don 't mention it.
White Lotus is powerful here ..

281
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:44,974
and they hate foreigners.

282
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:50,141
Since we are old friends ,
I'll be frank with you .

283
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:53,914
The way she dresses
will get herself into trouble

284
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,420
I know what you mean.
How much do I owe you ?

285
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,685
- Don 't worry about it.
-Thank you very much.

286
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:03,327
Please ask her to change

287
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:21,573
If I knew it was so boring,
I would not come.

288
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,178
Another one.

289
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,917
I wonder who will be the next one?
just get it over with.

290
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:01,783
Dr. Wong, it's your turn.

291
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,119
- Foon, our turn.
- I'll let you through.

292
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,317
- We'll go together .
- Please don't, Master .

293
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,992
Thank you .

294
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,369
Gentlemen , my topic today
is Chinese A cupuncture--

295
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:21,440
Quite?
He wants us to talk louder.

296
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,499
A human head contains
365 acupuncture points.

297
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:28,111
Wasn't that loud enough?

298
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,081
That 's not what he meant.
Mr. Wong, let me interpret for you .

299
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:49,866
- Excuse me You are ...
- My name is Sun Yat Sen.

300
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:53,133
Mr. Sun,
I really appreciate your help.

301
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:54,639
- Don 't mention it.
-Thank you .

302
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:58,408
Gold Wood Water , Fire and Earth
represent five organs of human body.

303
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,911
They form a network...

304
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,107
and acupuncture can control
human senses .

305
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:49,920
Mr. Wong, Dr. Thomson
doesn't quite understand acupuncture

306
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:54,558
He demonstrated the W estern
medical studies about the refex action .

307
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:59,333
It's simple I can put needles on
his acupuncture points...

308
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:02,068
so that his leg can 't move

309
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,713
You are not going to use
the needles on me, right?

310
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,720
Mr. Sun, ask him to test
if he can still move his leg .

311
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,585
White Lotus comes to earth...
relieves us from suffering.

312
00:25:56,663 --> 00:25:59,063
Kill all the foreigners
and we'll live in peace.

313
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:12,875
Master !

314
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,842
The W hite Lotus Sect again!

315
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,650
Master , I can 't move

316
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:26,551
I've been hit by an arrow !

317
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,552
I am doomed .

318
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:33,225
Why does everyone have to
treat me like an easy target ?

319
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:43,766
- Mr. Sun, your bag .
- Forget it!

320
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:53,709
All the foreign devils are gone.
Let's go back to the shrine.

321
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,447
- Are you okay ?
- I'm fine

322
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:58,218
Here's you bag , Mr. Sun.

323
00:26:58,358 --> 00:26:59,916
Mr. Wong...

324
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,360
we should exchange some ideas
when we have a chance

325
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:05,693
China needs more men like you .

326
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,163
Thank you for the compliment.

327
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:08,632
Good-bye

328
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,128
The W hite Lotus Sect
is a group of lawless fighters.

329
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:16,664
Master , Aunt 1 3
is alone in the inn!

330
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:18,836
Why didn 't you tell me earlier ?

331
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:26,511
The White Lotus Sect?

332
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:28,011
Come out!

333
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:32,152
Fei Hung?

334
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:37,419
Master , what 's the matter ?

335
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:40,057
Nothing. Let 's go

336
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:43,193
But you have turned pale
There must be something wrong.

337
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:45,430
It was only her changing--
nothing special !

338
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,336
- Mind your own business.
-But you have seen it all!

339
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:38,406
That blind man
makes too much noise

340
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:40,742
- Tell him to shut up .
- Get away .

341
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:44,211
Thank you .

342
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,043
Commander.

343
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,589
This is our only contact
with the outside world

344
00:30:51,657 --> 00:30:55,024
- Do your best to protect it.
- Yes , sir.

345
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:56,822
Commander.

346
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:09,402
Many poor people live
in Northgate

347
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,033
They could get hurt.

348
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,544
Try to drive the W hite Lotus
into Eastgate

349
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:15,080
Yes , sir.

350
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,043
Sir, if the riot continues...

351
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:21,018
we might be outnumbered .

352
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,581
Burn down Telegraph House

353
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,020
Master .

354
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,391
It's time for dinner .

355
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:36,560
I have bought a delicious dish
for Aunt 1 3.

356
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,100
- The tasty meat?
- Yeah.

357
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,232
- It's really tasty!
- What 's tasty meat?

358
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:47,141
Haven 't you told Aunt 1 3
what that is?

359
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,305
Don 't you know ?

360
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:57,822
Aunt 1 3, do you like dogs?

361
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:02,421
Sure, dogs are man 's best friend
I like dogs more than cats.

362
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:05,089
What 's the matter ?

363
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:07,792
Nothing. Let 's eat.

364
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:11,629
People like dogs in different ways.

365
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,274
They went that way.

366
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,239
Canton is in chaos.

367
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,375
Foon, pack our things after dinner .

368
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,385
We'll leave tomorrow morning...

369
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:29,250
and take the train back to Fo Shan .

370
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,516
Yes , Master .

371
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,582
Then you 'd better
eat well tonight....

372
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,719
since you might get train sick
like last time

373
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:43,493
I want to talk to you
after you are done with the dog meat.

374
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,503
You want to talk to me

375
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,805
What did you just say ?
Dog meat?

376
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:53,004
Is this really dog meat?

377
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,011
Yes .

378
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,140
Yes , Master loves dogs
like you do .

379
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,459
Aunt 1 3, I want to
teach you martial arts.

380
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,900
Why do I have to learn that ?

381
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:20,131
Our country is in turmoil.

382
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:23,404
You 'll need it for self-defense

383
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:26,206
Basic Technique has 36 postures .

384
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,213
Advanced Technique has 72 postures .

385
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,272
Both are Arrest Techniques.

386
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:31,680
Fei Hung!

387
00:33:32,118 --> 00:33:34,052
Do I have to remember all this?

388
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,112
just listen and try to
get the basic idea

389
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,682
Remember , for punches ,
grab the top of the arms.

390
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,092
For kicks,
block from underneath.

391
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:48,233
What if someone comes
with a knife

392
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,562
I'll teach you how to strike back
with your bare hands .

393
00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:54,169
Look,
this is the single-handed posture

394
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,933
And this is the two-handed posture

395
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,568
Carrying a gun would be
much easier and safer .

396
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:00,942
Quiet !

397
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,219
I shouldn 't yell at you .

398
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,380
But this is how I teach my students.

399
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:14,425
I'm fine Let 's continue .

400
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:17,754
Okay .

401
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,264
The first posture

402
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,527
Hold my head

403
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,730
Pay attention !

404
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,339
If he holds your head
grab his hand then twist.

405
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:31,534
- Holds the head grab the hand ..
-Then twist.

406
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,441
Twist.

407
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:33,876
Try again.

408
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,774
Holds the head
grab the hand then twist.

409
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,784
The second posture
Grab throat.

410
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:42,787
Here, grab my throat,
harder .

411
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:45,050
Grab the throat,
bend down, then move away .

412
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,433
Aunt 1 3.

413
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,803
Watch out!

414
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:35,431
Were you daydreaming?

415
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:39,307
I was practicing
the postures in my head

416
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:42,514
Try it once more

417
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:44,276
The first stance
Hold the head

418
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,045
And

419
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,614
Attack him.

420
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,152
Are you okay ?

421
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:58,958
I'd rather fight with you
than against you !

422
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:02,400
Sir, we have received a telegram
from Hong Kong.

423
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:04,663
We have no time for that now .

424
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:10,465
According to the telegram ,
an uprising will take place in Canton .

425
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:14,012
Here's the telegram .

426
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:23,183
Sir, another telegram
from Hong Kong.

427
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,515
This is an emergency.
Guard Telegraph House

428
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:32,360
- I'll have to speak to the governor .
- Yes , sir.

429
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,209
Your Excellency.

430
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,644
You know the ball is held by
the British Consul .

431
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:22,806
What 's so urgent?

432
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:27,376
Our agent in Hong Kong had sent
two telegrams today .

433
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:30,353
He reports that some people there
have formed a secret society...

434
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,083
and want to ship weapons to Canton .

435
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:33,819
They are planning an uprising.

436
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,352
Uprising?

437
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,861
- Is it the W hite Lotus Sect?
- No

438
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:42,364
The leader is called Sun Yat Sen.

439
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,901
Sun Yat Sen?

440
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:48,130
Who' s this Sun Yat Sen?

441
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:53,741
Your Excellency, he's the one
who founded the A gricultural Society.

442
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,509
He's a doctor who likes to
give speeches ...

443
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,507
and criticize government
all the time

444
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:01,576
He promotes democracy...

445
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,645
and even says that
China should be a republic.

446
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,451
How can a doctor
rise in rebellion ?

447
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:07,515
- Your Excellency--
- Do we have enough men ?

448
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:09,823
Our army has to
deal with those boxers...

449
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,829
so we are undermanned .

450
00:38:11,897 --> 00:38:14,195
Also the government is disputing
with France ..

451
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,029
at the northern border.

452
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,932
I believe there'll be a war soon.

453
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:20,938
I am afraid the government
won 't dispatch forces here

454
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:26,804
We are getting the British
on our side .

455
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:29,245
That should keep
other foreigners at bay .

456
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:40,556
Put the army and navy
on the alert!

457
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:44,653
And extra men at ports and stations
till we find Sun Yat Sen.

458
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,755
As for that society--

459
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:48,129
Agricultural Society.

460
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,465
Who else is involved
with Sun Yat Sen?

461
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,903
Someone called Luk Ho Dung
is the treasurer .

462
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:58,465
Governor .

463
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,069
Should we bring him in
for questioning?

464
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,375
Yes , let 's find out about him.

465
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,882
Yes , sir.

466
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:12,215
- Sir.
- I'm not going.

467
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:21,432
Sir.

468
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,341
Hey , you ! Wake him up .

469
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,749
Tell him it's not his day off.

470
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,256
Did you spend all night
at the brothel ? Get up .

471
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,417
Aunt 1 3, be careful .

472
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:49,187
Take it easy.

473
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:52,559
- Foon, what are you doing?
-She twisted her ankle

474
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:57,466
How ? She was fine last night.
When did this happen ?

475
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:02,572
I had no idea till I woke up
this morning. I could hardly walk.

476
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:06,804
Foon offered to carry me
when he found out.

477
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:07,968
Foon.

478
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,571
Master , I don't mind

479
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:12,746
Good Then I'll carry her ,
you take the luggage

480
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,014
It really hurts.

481
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:27,795
I always carry everything.

482
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:30,926
Now you want my job.
It's not fair.

483
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:35,305
Cashier .

484
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:39,343
Yes , may I help you ?

485
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,412
We'd like to check out.

486
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,307
- What are you doing?
-Boss.

487
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:48,478
Good morning, Master Wong.
We are leaving.

488
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:50,613
Finally, thank God .

489
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,782
No-- I mean, take care .

490
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:54,849
Sorry for the trouble
If you are ever --

491
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,326
Fei Hung, look!

492
00:40:56,428 --> 00:40:57,895
What happened ?

493
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,188
- He's injured .
- What happened ?

494
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:02,699
The W hite Lotus
burnt down the Language School.

495
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:05,532
- Take him to the doctor .
- What 's this language school?

496
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:07,538
It provides
foreign language education .

497
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,607
My God ! The students are there

498
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,642
Mr. Mak ,
where's the Language School?

499
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,575
To the left of the farmer 's market .

500
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,304
- Don 't go there
- Aunt 1 3.

501
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:17,713
- Master , where's she going?
- Why did she lie to me

502
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:19,114
Her ankle is fine

503
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:21,448
Master , it was her idea

504
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:23,043
Wait for me

505
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:23,522
" Language School"

506
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,513
" Language School"

507
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,181
Is this the place

508
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:37,568
Master , wait for me

509
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,819
- What is it?
- It's a human skin!

510
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:58,786
I was telling the truth.

511
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:17,740
Master !

512
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,334
The students!

513
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,906
Thank God !
They 've been hiding.

514
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:28,318
What 's going on ?

515
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:32,618
- Let me look.
- What 's in there

516
00:42:33,058 --> 00:42:35,583
They are gone now .
Don 't worry.

517
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,754
I'm scared
They were mean to us .

518
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,799
- That 's right!
-They stormed in and beat us .

519
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:43,300
Master Wong,
how come you are still here

520
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,131
And why'd you bring
all the kids with you ?

521
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:48,037
They are students
from the Language School.

522
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:52,407
They can 't stay here If the fighters
come for them , I'm finished .

523
00:42:52,678 --> 00:42:54,270
I don't know any one of them .

524
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,439
Not to mention
they learn foreign languages .

525
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,745
Why don't you take them
to City Hall?

526
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:00,512
Please help them !

527
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:02,417
Master Wong,
I can 't fight like you .

528
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:04,820
This inn is all I have
to support my family.

529
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,018
- If anything happened , I--
- I'll help!

530
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,821
- Mr. Mak .
- He passed out.

531
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,820
Get up , Mr. Mak .

532
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:15,991
You can 't force him,
even if you are Wong Fei Hung.

533
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:19,196
If he dies ,
it will be all your fault.

534
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:23,731
We can 't force things to happen .
Let 's go

535
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,035
Let 's send the students
home first.

536
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:30,648
- Where do you live, kids ?
- I'm from the Guangxi Province

537
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:32,011
Guangxi Province

538
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:33,915
I'm also from the Guangxi Province

539
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,318
I'm from the Fujian Province

540
00:43:36,388 --> 00:43:39,357
This one is from Fujian .
These two are from Guangxi.

541
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:42,484
I think they all come from
different provinces .

542
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:44,956
Any of you live in Canton ?

543
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,488
I live at Northgate
So does he

544
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,762
I live at Shamian .

545
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:54,135
So do I.
I think I live near Eastgate

546
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,441
Anyone else live around here

547
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:01,605
I came here by train.
Idon't remember where I live

548
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:06,946
Let 's take these two home first.
The rest will go with us .

549
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,817
- Kid get on my shoulders.
-By the way ...

550
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:12,550
buy some rice stuffing,
in case they get hungry.

551
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,889
Waiter , give me 20 rice stuffings.

552
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:18,020
Come, I'll carry you .

553
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:33,835
Sir.

554
00:44:34,646 --> 00:44:37,114
- How can I help you ?
- You must be the owner .

555
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:40,640
Have the students from
the Language School been here

556
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,020
Students? No, you have come
to the wrong place

557
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:45,021
Wait!

558
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:51,128
Has anybody seen the students?

559
00:44:51,196 --> 00:44:53,596
Don 't be silly.
This is a restaurant.

560
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:56,065
They might have been kidnapped .

561
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:01,738
King of heaven

562
00:45:01,807 --> 00:45:04,708
Ruler of hell

563
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:07,040
Thank goodness!
I didn't let them stay.

564
00:45:07,112 --> 00:45:11,776
Unite with the White Lotus Sect

565
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:16,618
Bring peace to our country

566
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:18,053
Get the lucky charm .

567
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:19,556
Give me one

568
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:23,391
Carry the lantern
and you will be safe

569
00:45:23,462 --> 00:45:26,124
Carry the lucky charm
and you will be blessed .

570
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:29,599
Donate the money
and you will be rewarded .

571
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:32,068
Donate the money now .

572
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,735
It brings you peace

573
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,902
Sure

574
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:43,345
The more you get ,
the better you will be

575
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:07,936
Hurry! We have to get going.

576
00:46:10,342 --> 00:46:11,707
Be quiet .

577
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:13,210
Are you bleeding?

578
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:15,940
Not me It's his.

579
00:46:19,918 --> 00:46:21,783
He's seriously injured .

580
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,821
We can 't stay here

581
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:26,389
I'll go ask the City Hall
to take the students in.

582
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,392
Stay here and wait for me

583
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,896
Foon.
Help treat the kid' s wound

584
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,329
I am not finished yet .

585
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:39,495
Don 't be naughty.
Come back here

586
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:44,408
Foon, you smell.

587
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:49,777
- You have peed on me
- I told you I wasn't done yet .

588
00:48:13,965 --> 00:48:17,298
Commander, Wong Fei Hung
is here to see you .

589
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,834
Master Wong,
please wait here.

590
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:41,085
Your Excellency.

591
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:27,997
Sir.

592
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,390
No wonder you are
the chief trainer of the local militia

593
00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:49,689
Thank you for your compliment.

594
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:52,389
I was just trying to learn from you .

595
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:55,797
The reputation of your Shao Lin
stick fight is well deserved .

596
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,061
Maybe you can teach me
some other time

597
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:00,764
Have some wine

598
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:02,306
Thank you .

599
00:50:07,012 --> 00:50:09,207
There's nothing special
about his stick fight.

600
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:12,715
That pole didn 't move at all
and people call him " Kung Fu Master " .

601
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:14,718
I think it's an exaggeration .

602
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:23,591
Our men are out
protecting foreigners.

603
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:26,220
It may not be safe here

604
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:30,334
If the students stay here,
those fighters will come for them .

605
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,391
Sir.

606
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:34,927
I know our job is to serve
and to protect the civilians.

607
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,938
Unfortunately, I am unable to...

608
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:40,603
cope with the situation
without help.

609
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:43,747
I feel so ashamed .

610
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,256
Foon.

611
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,518
Come over here

612
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,222
Let me through.

613
00:50:58,296 --> 00:51:00,764
Don 't get in his way .

614
00:51:00,966 --> 00:51:02,900
He's still bleeding.

615
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:04,968
Master isn't back yet .
What shall we do ?

616
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:08,233
- He's not moving at all.
- Why doesn't he move

617
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,001
It's Mozart .

618
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:14,739
Not too tight? He's bleeding.

619
00:51:14,813 --> 00:51:17,543
No, I mean the music.

620
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,618
There must be
a foreign consulate nearby.

621
00:51:20,685 --> 00:51:22,118
A foreign consulate

622
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,257
Beware of fire

623
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:35,430
Beware of burglary

624
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,434
Aunt 1 3? Foon?

625
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:41,772
- I need to pee .
- Can 't you hold it?

626
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,705
It's bad for my kidneys.

627
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,402
So what ?
They are rotten anyway .

628
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,876
Don 't move

629
00:51:47,412 --> 00:51:48,811
Stop !

630
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,278
Where did you fighters take
the women and kids ?

631
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:59,014
I am not a fighter .
My kids are in bed now .

632
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,058
And my woman ran away
with another man .

633
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:02,559
- What ?
- Master .

634
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:04,151
Foon, where have you been?

635
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:08,631
Aunt 1 3 took the kids
to a safe place

636
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,133
Really?

637
00:52:11,636 --> 00:52:14,503
Why are you holding
a White Lotus lantern?

638
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:17,063
We thought it could
bring us good luck.

639
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:19,633
But it only brought the opposite
Can we go now ?

640
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:22,612
- Go
- Let 's go

641
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,273
Hurry up .

642
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,509
Foon, take me to that place

643
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:27,986
How can you not remember me

644
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:29,419
How can you not remember me

645
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:31,512
I was here earlier with
a group of kids .

646
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:34,683
And a beautiful lady too .

647
00:52:34,759 --> 00:52:37,193
But I left for my master .

648
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:39,196
Do you remember ?

649
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:41,255
You are wasting my time

650
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:44,263
What 's wrong?
Did Aunt 1 3 bring those kids here

651
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:47,270
Yes . He did let us in,
but now he refuses to do so

652
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:50,671
- Aunt 1 3!
- Aunt 1 3!

653
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:53,271
I am here with Master .

654
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:58,615
Master , he asked us
to stand straight.

655
00:52:58,683 --> 00:53:00,275
That 's what I heard

656
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:02,749
Aunt 1 3!

657
00:53:02,821 --> 00:53:04,880
We are waiting at the front gate

658
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,856
They opened the gate, Master .

659
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:12,019
What 's that for ?

660
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:13,860
Foon, stay calm.

661
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,333
- You misunderstood us .
- Foon, explain to them .

662
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,564
- I did
- Put your guns away .

663
00:53:20,638 --> 00:53:23,869
- What did you say ?
- Why can 't you understand

664
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:26,502
Stop .

665
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,011
Leave this to me

666
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:36,410
I'm Luk Ho Dung.
And you are ...

667
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,512
Wong Fei Hung from Fo Shan .

668
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:41,718
Wong Fei Hung.
You saved those students.

669
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:43,886
That 's right.
They are all inside .

670
00:53:43,995 --> 00:53:46,463
- But they won 't let us in.
- It's only a mistake

671
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:48,055
Stand back!

672
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:49,327
Sergeant.

673
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:48,554
Mr. Luk .

674
00:54:50,395 --> 00:54:54,331
Why do foreigners crucify
their god ?

675
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:00,394
It speaks to something
in their souls.

676
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:02,336
When we are young,
we learn the myths.

677
00:55:02,407 --> 00:55:05,843
And we interpret them
as we get older.

678
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,812
After all, we see
they are just myths.

679
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,475
Why do you always look
at your watch?

680
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,108
Waiting for someone

681
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:17,052
My friend always does it,
so I copy him.

682
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:19,055
He says time is valuable

683
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:21,387
We Chinese waste a lot of time

684
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:26,489
I can 't read those foreign watches .

685
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:28,498
I'll never keep good time

686
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:56,958
Don 't come down.
Don 't be afraid

687
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:59,053
Foon, take them upstairs.

688
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:04,727
They are foreign merchants
and their families .

689
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:07,896
And they are hiding
from the W hite Lotus Sect.

690
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:23,554
- They are looking for doctors.
- Doctors? Then they need Master .

691
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:30,191
They are looking for doctors.

692
00:56:38,303 --> 00:56:40,533
They don't want Chinese doctors.

693
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:47,475
Dr. Sun.

694
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,875
Mr. Wong.

695
00:56:51,382 --> 00:56:53,009
- This is--
- I know .

696
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:56,019
He's the friend that I mentioned .

697
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,134
Burn it down!

698
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:28,477
White Lotus is making trouble again.

699
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:36,558
Luk .

700
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:41,493
Which of these watches is right?

701
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:43,557
Sun, your watch is fast.

702
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:46,296
Mine can 't keep up with yours.

703
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:48,805
Stop joking.
Let 's go see the patients.

704
00:57:52,377 --> 00:57:55,403
Foon, I never thought
time was so important.

705
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,451
I didn 't think you 'd understand

706
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:08,954
Burn the evil foreigners.
Stop them from endangering the world

707
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:19,396
And burn this evil woman too .
She makes lightning bolts.

708
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,640
Aunt 1 3.

709
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,045
Oh , no
They are taking her soul.

710
00:58:31,115 --> 00:58:33,083
If they are so powerful ,
how come they lost?

711
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:36,712
They cannot take her soul.
It's just a superstition .

712
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:38,722
Don 't worry about it. Relax .

713
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:43,727
I am afraid she'll vomit.

714
00:58:45,363 --> 00:58:47,388
She's not train sick.

715
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:01,838
Dr. Sun, what do you suggest?

716
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:07,013
Luk , ask Wong Fei Hung in.

717
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,677
Are you feeling better ?

718
00:59:09,854 --> 00:59:14,416
Mr. Wong, Sun would like you
to go in and help a patient.

719
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:17,325
- Where's he
-Over there

720
00:59:17,395 --> 00:59:18,885
Take me there

721
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:13,740
He said thank you .

722
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:16,041
He has never seen
anything like this.

723
01:01:16,113 --> 01:01:18,081
Don 't say that .
Sayving lives is crucial .

724
01:01:46,844 --> 01:01:50,837
- What 's the matter ?
- Follow me Don 't go anywhere

725
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,815
I won 't leave you .

726
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:55,408
Those kids .

727
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,591
Watch out, Sun! Get down!

728
01:02:21,212 --> 01:02:23,237
The soldiers have occupied
Telegraph House

729
01:02:23,314 --> 01:02:25,214
We have lost contact
with Hong Kong.

730
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,843
Shall we proceed
with our plan for revolution ?

731
01:02:27,918 --> 01:02:32,014
It's too risky.
We must disperse our men for a while

732
01:02:35,226 --> 01:02:37,217
We can each tell some

733
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:42,289
Our only link with the outside
is the telex at the consulate

734
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:44,527
Luk , you know
how to send a telex .

735
01:02:44,602 --> 01:02:47,696
Stay here and keep contact
with the outside world

736
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:49,205
Sun, I--

737
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:51,332
I have arranged a safe hideout
for your family.

738
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:54,435
I'm going back to Y uan Kong Villa now ,
then to the wedding party.

739
01:02:54,512 --> 01:02:56,878
If you don't hear anything from me ..

740
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,973
leave for Hong Kong
early tomorrow morning.

741
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,349
In order to prevent
time discrepancy...

742
01:03:05,423 --> 01:03:07,721
take my watch with you .

743
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:10,488
If we fail...

744
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:12,722
you should keep it.

745
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:16,760
I will.

746
01:03:22,473 --> 01:03:24,907
- Where are you going, Dr. ?
- I've got things to take care of .

747
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:27,500
- I'll walk you out. It's dangerous.
-Thank you .

748
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:31,474
- Don 't come with us .
- Fei Hung, be careful !

749
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,211
Protected by the divine power .

750
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:36,082
Kill the evil foreigners!

751
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:41,915
Dr. Sun.
How will you get out?

752
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,359
It's easier to save men
than their country.

753
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:52,527
Looks like
we can 't save so many people

754
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,972
Get away --

755
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,632
Kick them out!

756
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:01,610
Leave now . Hurry.

757
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:05,581
Mr. Wong, good-bye

758
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:11,181
Sir, we just want
to expel the foreigners.

759
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:13,314
The W hite Lotus won 't kill
our own people

760
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,325
I'm glad to hear you say that .

761
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,725
Let our government
negotiate with the foreigners.

762
01:04:17,795 --> 01:04:20,263
Were they more capable, China would not
have ceded so many territories .

763
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:22,765
That 's right!
It's bullshit.

764
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:29,335
If you keep making trouble here,
I'll arrest you all!

765
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,637
Take the altar away .

766
01:04:48,025 --> 01:04:49,959
Let 's search this place

767
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:18,547
Luk is hiding here

768
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:24,519
Mr. Luk .

769
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:30,696
- Let 's go
- Yes , sir!

770
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:42,942
Cut all the wires .

771
01:05:44,548 --> 01:05:46,778
Isolate them from the outside world

772
01:05:48,352 --> 01:05:51,947
All is fair in wa

773
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:55,415
We are now at wa

774
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,427
We have no choice

775
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,757
But, sir--

776
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,525
I know .Just do it.

777
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,863
Yes , sir.

778
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:13,705
Follow the Commander's orders.
Go

779
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,444
They protect the rebels
because they want to restrain us .

780
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,711
Pull it up .

781
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,466
Now is the time

782
01:07:00,724 --> 01:07:02,055
Okay .

783
01:07:02,126 --> 01:07:04,686
Since you all have guts,
follow me

784
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,693
Remember , don't move
after you pose the stance

785
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,428
This is called the Kneebend

786
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:16,940
When you pose the stance,
unlimited strength will come

787
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:21,034
Walk the Unicorn Steps,
then Kneebend

788
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:24,603
Hold the head
grab the hands and twist.

789
01:07:24,682 --> 01:07:29,984
Watch carefully.
Return to the original position .

790
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:32,454
One more

791
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:36,624
Hang on ! Pose for two hours.

792
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:38,823
Foon!

793
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:43,633
Do you know the posture
Ijust practiced ?

794
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:46,363
- Arrest Technique ?
- Yes , I have learned a little bit.

795
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,462
But I need to refresh my memory .

796
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:51,838
That 's easy.
I'll attack, and you counterattack.

797
01:07:51,909 --> 01:07:53,399
Watch out!

798
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:02,647
Should we try again?
Maybe we need to change places .

799
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,081
What are you doing?

800
01:08:05,155 --> 01:08:06,679
Why are you holding Aunt 1 3?

801
01:08:07,825 --> 01:08:09,349
I'm teaching her
the A rrest Technique .

802
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:13,192
Does she need you to teach her ?
I can teach her !

803
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,322
It's disrespectful for you
to hold her like this.

804
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:17,060
Go downstairs!
Kneebend for half an hour.

805
01:08:19,503 --> 01:08:21,437
- I--
- Go downstairs!

806
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,636
Stop looking!

807
01:08:29,513 --> 01:08:31,378
Kneebend

808
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,385
I'm going, Master .

809
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,423
What are you doing?

810
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:45,121
- Kneebend
- Do you think that 's the Kneebend

811
01:08:48,532 --> 01:08:51,000
Don 't be mad at him.

812
01:08:51,068 --> 01:08:53,229
I asked him to teach me

813
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:54,895
You did

814
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:03,674
Why not ask him to come up ?

815
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:05,408
Go ahead

816
01:09:10,788 --> 01:09:12,551
Punish me for teaching her
Arrest Technique .

817
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:15,148
What if I teach her wrestling?

818
01:09:21,932 --> 01:09:24,400
These foreigners are really lazy.

819
01:09:24,468 --> 01:09:27,460
If the W hite Lotus came,
you 'd be dead meat.

820
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,536
Trying to scare me

821
01:10:14,284 --> 01:10:16,878
Foreign devil.
Let 's wait for her to come down.

822
01:10:20,324 --> 01:10:22,758
Mr. Luk .

823
01:10:25,362 --> 01:10:27,523
Have you seen Foon?

824
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,893
- White Lotus ?
- Help!

825
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,838
The fighters are here

826
01:10:50,254 --> 01:10:51,846
Foreign devil.

827
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:05,134
They really want to kill us !

828
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,002
The wind and fire together .

829
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:14,907
Kill all the foreigners.

830
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:18,880
The W hite Lotus , savior of the world
Expel all the devils!

831
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:21,042
You hide first.
Don 't go anywhere

832
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:23,450
I'll be right back.

833
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:34,630
Watch out!

834
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:36,325
- Mr. Luk .
- Yes .

835
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,402
Sir.

836
01:12:51,475 --> 01:12:53,067
Let 's wait and watch.

837
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:03,847
You 'll be dead meat!

838
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,752
Kneebend

839
01:13:24,741 --> 01:13:26,038
Master .

840
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:29,044
Foon, you help me
deal with these guys.

841
01:13:29,112 --> 01:13:31,376
I'll go and get those two horses .

842
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,554
Get down.

843
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:02,943
Wanna leave

844
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,255
Foon, tie them up .

845
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:16,326
See if there are
any other fighters around

846
01:14:19,096 --> 01:14:20,495
Go and arrest them .

847
01:14:20,564 --> 01:14:21,622
- Let 's go
- Yes .

848
01:14:27,404 --> 01:14:29,167
Arrest the fighters!

849
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:51,789
Leave quickly.

850
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,904
What are you looking at ?
Go back inside .

851
01:15:01,972 --> 01:15:03,837
They 're fighting outside .

852
01:15:07,744 --> 01:15:09,177
Sir.

853
01:15:15,185 --> 01:15:17,881
Fei Hung,
Commander killed the consula

854
01:15:25,629 --> 01:15:27,563
Search everywhere

855
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:43,178
Tell Sun Yat Sen to run for his life

856
01:15:45,015 --> 01:15:46,448
Fei Hung...

857
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:51,717
I know you treat me like your aunt.

858
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:54,450
But I treat you
like the man in my heart.

859
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:03,666
If we miss each other ,
come back and look for me

860
01:16:13,543 --> 01:16:14,976
It's time to go

861
01:16:29,559 --> 01:16:32,027
No matter what ,
we have to make it through tonight...

862
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:37,362
so you can see
the shining sun tomorrow .

863
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:39,129
Understand

864
01:16:42,572 --> 01:16:46,872
Foon, you 'll be the decoy .
Go and distract the soldiers.

865
01:16:46,943 --> 01:16:50,276
And get the name list
from the market .

866
01:16:50,347 --> 01:16:53,612
- I will.
- Foon, take this watch.

867
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:56,618
Go to the pier
at 7:00 in the morning.

868
01:16:57,687 --> 01:16:59,587
Get the name list back.

869
01:17:12,202 --> 01:17:13,635
Siu-qun .

870
01:17:15,605 --> 01:17:19,439
You called my name
It's the first time you called my name

871
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,857
Who are you ?

872
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:43,695
Sir, I'm the interpreter
of the consulate

873
01:17:44,935 --> 01:17:46,493
Go

874
01:17:50,941 --> 01:17:52,533
Foon, go now .

875
01:17:58,648 --> 01:18:00,809
Mr. Luk .

876
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:05,387
- Luk ? Go after him.
- Go after him.

877
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,827
Commander.

878
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:13,226
Wong Fei Hung.

879
01:18:13,296 --> 01:18:16,197
We must capture the fighter 's leader,
so the riot will stop .

880
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:18,860
I'll go to the shrine
and eradicate them .

881
01:18:18,935 --> 01:18:20,334
Good Who' s that ?

882
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,833
- Foon.
- Master .

883
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:24,737
- Greet the Commander.
-Sir.

884
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:27,003
He was beaten up
by the W hite Lotus .

885
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,671
Sir, I don't know
what will happen to me

886
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,182
Please take care of the kids for me

887
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:35,750
Okay , I promise you .

888
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,048
Thank you .

889
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:42,190
- Escort Master Wong to the shrine
- Yes .

890
01:19:10,854 --> 01:19:13,618
White Lotus !
I want to join you .

891
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:21,628
Welcome, guests
of the W hite Lotus Sect.

892
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:28,763
The entrance is guarded
by the soldiers.

893
01:19:28,838 --> 01:19:30,271
How can we escape?

894
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,673
There must be other entrances
for a shrine like this.

895
01:19:33,743 --> 01:19:35,176
I'm sure we can get out of here.

896
01:19:35,245 --> 01:19:39,113
Under the incense,
long live the W hite Lotus Sect.

897
01:19:39,182 --> 01:19:41,116
We don't know
what 's ahead of us .

898
01:19:41,184 --> 01:19:43,482
Don 't worry.
Take it easy.

899
01:19:46,723 --> 01:19:49,817
- There's no turning back now .
- Let 's face it together then .

900
01:19:55,632 --> 01:19:58,100
The Maitreya comes
to save all people

901
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,762
The W hite Lotus comes to earth
and relieves us from suffering.

902
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:03,670
Our sect brings goodness
to the world

903
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:05,674
We need new members
to spread the word

904
01:20:05,742 --> 01:20:07,767
Kneel!

905
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:14,375
Wong Fei Hung, Leung Foon,
come to the alta

906
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:24,153
Three bowls full of rice to purify you .

907
01:20:24,227 --> 01:20:26,252
Let the ceremony begin.

908
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:37,369
Drink the holy water ,
become a child of the Sect.

909
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,965
All members are brothers.

910
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,238
Everyone shares the same blood

911
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:45,304
Rich or poor, all are equal.

912
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,215
If you break the oath,
you 'll be outcast.

913
01:20:51,488 --> 01:20:53,979
After this drink,
you 'll be a member forever .

914
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:57,754
Thunderbolts will strike anyone
who betrays us .

915
01:20:57,827 --> 01:20:59,192
Master .

916
01:20:59,262 --> 01:21:01,696
Be loyal before Maitreya
Drink it!

917
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:16,909
God in heaven , devil below .

918
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:19,448
Protected by the divine power ,
I shall fear nothing.

919
01:21:19,516 --> 01:21:22,007
Fear no blade or sword

920
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:23,916
For my body can not be harmed .

921
01:21:25,522 --> 01:21:29,049
Protected by the divine power ,
I shall fear nothing.

922
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,891
For my body can not be harmed .

923
01:21:32,962 --> 01:21:35,055
Master Wong!

924
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:37,959
You 're despicable

925
01:21:39,636 --> 01:21:40,933
Take back your evil water .

926
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,880
Protected by the divine power .

927
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:58,215
Wong, how dare
you make trouble here

928
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:01,587
The Immortal Kung's name is famous...

929
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:06,527
but I need to see him
before joining the Sect.

930
01:22:06,596 --> 01:22:08,621
I want to see him!

931
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:14,328
You can 't see his holy face
that easily.

932
01:22:14,404 --> 01:22:17,669
I can 't?
So I'll fight my way in.

933
01:22:22,412 --> 01:22:24,642
- How dare you , scoundrel !
- You leave first.

934
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,681
Surround him!
Don 't let him go

935
01:22:32,755 --> 01:22:35,383
Find your way out. Be careful .

936
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:41,259
Four elements, eight people,
against you !

937
01:22:42,432 --> 01:22:45,799
Surround him!
Don 't let him go

938
01:22:48,438 --> 01:22:49,837
See if your god can protect you .

939
01:23:05,054 --> 01:23:06,316
Divine--

940
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:17,656
You 're all frauds .

941
01:23:18,601 --> 01:23:20,626
Protected by the divine power .

942
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,669
Kung, why don't you come out?

943
01:23:30,446 --> 01:23:33,973
This whole thing is a fraud
I want to reveal the truth.

944
01:23:35,618 --> 01:23:37,882
Protect the alta

945
01:23:41,324 --> 01:23:44,157
We sacrifice our lives
for the W hite Lotus !

946
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:51,800
I'll fight you to the death.

947
01:24:08,017 --> 01:24:10,008
Come here if you want to die

948
01:24:11,754 --> 01:24:16,020
We are protected by the divine power .
Go ahead

949
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:20,891
Stop or I'll shoot!

950
01:24:20,964 --> 01:24:25,697
Look! Your idol can 't protect you .
Stop this superstitious nonsense

951
01:24:25,768 --> 01:24:28,703
- You are the one who lies .
- Yeah!

952
01:24:28,771 --> 01:24:30,705
- You --
- Mr. Luk !

953
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:34,140
If you move, I'll shoot.
Let 's see who will die

954
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,144
Everyone step aside .

955
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:42,782
I'm not afraid of the gun .
I'm protected !

956
01:24:42,852 --> 01:24:46,948
Protected by the divine power ,
nothing can harm us .

957
01:24:49,993 --> 01:24:52,894
Kid you 'll die Go away !

958
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:55,396
Protected by the divine power ,
nothing can harm us .

959
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,401
Unite with the W hite Lotus ,
and bring peace to our country.

960
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,130
Don 't be afraid of him!

961
01:25:01,204 --> 01:25:02,899
Go

962
01:25:05,174 --> 01:25:08,666
- I've shot the little girl.
- Hurry! We must go

963
01:25:20,356 --> 01:25:22,347
Don 't come any closer .

964
01:25:22,425 --> 01:25:26,759
Look at those fools,
giving up their lives for that idol.

965
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:28,763
Mr. Luk , we must leave

966
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:33,358
If we are just as rotten ,
how can our country be saved ?

967
01:25:33,436 --> 01:25:36,234
Where can we go?
We have no place to go

968
01:25:45,748 --> 01:25:47,682
Get them !

969
01:25:49,318 --> 01:25:52,219
Where can we go?

970
01:25:52,288 --> 01:25:54,222
We can 't escape

971
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,884
Don 't let them get away !

972
01:26:20,316 --> 01:26:22,648
God above, take over my body.

973
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:26,155
Give me power to show my strength.

974

Exorcise the evil spirits!

975
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:39,464
I am God .
Come to worship me

976
01:26:39,535 --> 01:26:44,529
Kung, how dare you
do evil in my name ..

977
01:26:44,607 --> 01:26:49,874
anger the gods
and destroy humanity?!

978
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:51,436
I'll handle you !

979
01:26:52,882 --> 01:26:55,316
Come out,
or I'll burn my own alta

980
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:02,214
Kung is here

981
01:27:25,248 --> 01:27:28,513
Welcome, The Immortal Kung.

982
01:27:28,584 --> 01:27:30,814
Invincible Kung.

983
01:27:43,933 --> 01:27:47,562
The universe is controlled by us !

984
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:49,806
The goddess gave me power ...

985
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,502
The goddess gave me power ...

986
01:27:52,575 --> 01:27:54,668
to set up a new alta
for the shrine ..

987
01:27:54,744 --> 01:27:57,508
to exorcise evil spirits.

988
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:01,038
Goddess, please come out
to the Heavenwards Shrine

989
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:03,210

996
01:29:41,384 --> 01:29:43,614
Get down!

Your turn, please

1000
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,466
Supreme God , protect me

1001
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:04,030
I'll leave this broken alta
for you .

1002
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:11,004
Keep still!

1003
01:30:12,148 --> 01:30:13,410
Damn you !

1004
01:30:16,218 --> 01:30:18,743
How dare you wreck my alta !

1005
01:30:20,589 --> 01:30:22,079
Protect the Immortal Kung.

1006
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:30,392
Use the cloth for the alta

1007
01:30:32,001 --> 01:30:34,196
You want to die

1008
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:39,674
Guardians of heaven ,

Kung, you have summoned all the gods
in heaven . Is that enough for you ?

1015
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:03,795
- One god is enough if it's any good
- You have offended them all.

1016
01:31:04,467 --> 01:31:06,230
Let me punish you .

01:32:18,707 --> 01:32:20,698
Killer cloth!

1028
01:32:30,386 --> 01:32:32,718
I am not a god .
I'm Wong Fei Hung.

1029
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:35,780
You can 't even tell gods from devils.

1030
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:39,656
Wong Fei Hung, prepare to die

1031
01:32:45,367 --> 01:32:47,232
White Lotus Blossom .

1032
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:57,211
You can 't keep your feet
on the ground

1033
01:33:00,082 --> 01:33:01,674
What a crook!

1034
01:33:04,086 --> 01:33:07,055
Wong Fei Hung,
how dare you insult the gods?

1035
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:11,253
- God bless me
- He'd be blind to bless you .

1036
01:33:19,068 --> 01:33:21,002
Solar Explosion !

1037
01:33:37,186 --> 01:33:39,211
Kung, the show is over .

1038
01:33:42,358 --> 01:33:47,386
You claimed to bring peace to the world
but you brought violent death.

1039
01:33:47,463 --> 01:33:49,397
I'll challenge your so-called
divine power .

1040
01:33:57,907 --> 01:34:00,341
- No one can stop me
- I can !

1041
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:09,409
- Arrest Technique ?
- Yes .

1042
01:34:30,906 --> 01:34:34,808
- Iron Front?
- His divine power was earthly iron !

1043
01:34:37,012 --> 01:34:40,448
Gods are useless.
You must rely on yourself.

1044
01:34:41,617 --> 01:34:44,051
My body is protected
by the divine power .

1045
01:34:44,119 --> 01:34:45,814
The Immortal Kung.

1046
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:49,949
How could this be Why?

1047
01:34:53,195 --> 01:34:55,254
Let 's go

1048
01:35:01,003 --> 01:35:03,528
What time is it?

1049
01:35:03,606 --> 01:35:06,598
I can 't read
It's useless to give this to me

1050
01:35:09,612 --> 01:35:11,273
Master !

1051
01:35:11,347 --> 01:35:13,440
Great. We meet again.

1052
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:19,486
It's 6:00 now .
We still have time

1053
01:35:19,555 --> 01:35:22,353
- Where's the name list?
- Name list?

1054
01:35:22,424 --> 01:35:24,824
Oh , no My mind was
on distracting the soldiers.

1055
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:28,056
- And I forgot the list.
- Why are you so careless?

1056
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,894
- I have to go to the market .
- Can you make it?

1057
01:35:30,966 --> 01:35:34,732
I have to get it.
It's a matter of life and death.

1058
01:35:34,803 --> 01:35:37,135
Let 's go

1059
01:35:43,045 --> 01:35:45,639
Luk , why do you still want
to go to the market ?

1060
01:35:45,714 --> 01:35:49,548
I must take the name list back.
The ship leaves in 30 minutes .

1061
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:52,553
We have to meet Sun
at the pier on time

1062
01:35:55,557 --> 01:35:57,184
Wait here

1063
01:36:09,672 --> 01:36:13,836
Foon, see if Luk is ready yet .
I'll stay here on guard

1064
01:36:16,178 --> 01:36:18,612
- Can I do something to help?
- I've got it. Let 's go

1065
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,613
Soldiers are coming. Hide .

1066
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,624
- Master Wong, this way .
- Master .

- I've been shot .
- Help him up .

1069
01:36:47,309 --> 01:36:49,573
Foon, where were you hit?

1070
01:36:49,645 --> 01:36:52,978
- Let me have a look.
- Here! lt hurts!

1071
01:36:55,951 --> 01:36:58,146
Luckily, they shot your watch,
otherwise--

1072
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:03,756
Mr. Luk !

1073
01:37:03,826 --> 01:37:05,589
Get down!

1074
01:37:14,303 --> 01:37:15,930
Foon, you go first.

1075
01:37:16,004 --> 01:37:18,029
Luk , hang in there

1076
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,467
This way , Master .

1077

Freeze

1078
01:37:42,464 --> 01:37:44,398
There's a way out here

1079
01:37:46,769 --> 01:37:48,828
Are you all right?

1080
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:51,896
I can 't walk anymore
Leave me here

1081
01:37:55,611 --> 01:37:58,011
Let me help you .

1082
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,414
This list is extremely important.

1083
01:38:02,484 --> 01:38:07,012
Don 't let the government have it,
or many people will get killed .

1084
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:11,250
Take me over there

1085
01:38:16,532 --> 01:38:19,228
Don 't burn this cloth.

1086
01:38:20,302 --> 01:38:24,932
Promise me you 'll bring this
to Sun personally.

1087
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:28,499
Tell him I died for the revolution .

1088
01:38:28,577 --> 01:38:30,670
He must live for the revolution .

1089
01:38:36,618 --> 01:38:36,785
Blood They 're in here

1090
01:38:36,785 --> 01:38:39,720
Blood They 're in here

1091

Don 't come over here

1104
01:40:06,275 --> 01:40:07,708
Master , be careful .

Okay , are you ready ?

1113

Go to hell.
You are pushing me

1114
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:10,905
Don 't you want to fight me

1115
01:41:13,942 --> 01:41:15,637
Mr. Luk .

1116
01:41:16,778 --> 01:41:20,270
Time-- Time is vital .

You have no way out.

Sooner or later ,
they will know ...

01:42:39,895 --> 01:42:42,693
it was you who killed
the British consul .

1124
01:42:42,864 --> 01:42:44,991
You have no way out either .

1125
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:48,730
Loos like both of us are doomed .

1126

What time is it?

1131
01:45:03,738 --> 01:45:07,230
I can 't tell the time,
but it's getting bright.
