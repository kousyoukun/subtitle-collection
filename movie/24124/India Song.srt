1
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:20,557
A beggar woman.

2
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:23,062
- Mad?
- Yes.

3
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:27,273
Ah yes. I remember.

4
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,176
She follows the rivers.

5
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:33,359
Comes from Burma.

6
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:59,361
Not Indian.
She comes from Savannakhet.

7
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:02,217
Born there.

8
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:06,483
Walking...

9
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,787
For ten years.

10
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,858
And one day,
in front of her, the Ganges.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,692
- Yes.
- She stays.

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,267
That's right.

13
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,931
12 children dead
while she walked towards Bengal?

14
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,548
Yes.

15
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:34,197
She leaves them.
Sells them, forgets them.

16
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:40,222
On the way to Bengal,
she goes barren

17
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:53,566
- Savannakhet, Laos?
- Yes.

18
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,671
At seventeen.

19
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,101
Pregnant... seventeen...

20
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:04,887
...thrown out by her mother,
goes away...

21
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,776
...asks the way to get lost.

22
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,473
No one knows.

23
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:44,204
In Calcutta they were together.

24
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,781
- She and the white woman?
- Yes.

25
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,030
During the same years...

26
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:10,572
- He had followed her to India.
- Yes.

27
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,210
For her, he left everything.

28
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,025
Overnight.

29
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,341
- The night of the ball?
- yes.

30
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:27,372
Michael Richardson was engaged
to a girl from S. Thala,

31
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:30,990
Lola Valerie Stein.

32
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:38,599
They were to marry in the autumn.

33
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,929
Then, the ball,

34
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,028
The ball at S. Thala.

35
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,294
She arrived late...

36
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,285
...in the middle of the night...

37
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,709
...in black.

38
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,225
That ball, such love...

39
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,763
such desire.

40
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,953
That light?

41
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:13,890
The monsoon.

42
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:17,139
That dust?

43
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,692
Central Calcutta.

44
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,341
What is that scent of flowers?

45
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,558
Leprosy.

46
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,775
Where are we?

47
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:46,912
The French Embassy, in India.

48
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:53,133
- That murmur?
- The Ganges.

49
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:07,212
When she died, he left India?

50
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,065
Yes.

51
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:14,081
Her grave is in the English cemetery?

52
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,755
Yes.

53
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:27,844
- She died out there?
- On the islands.

54
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:34,020
Found dead one night.

55
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:49,223
A black Lancia...

56
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,977
...speeds along the road
to Chandernagore.

57
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:00,417
It was there that she first tried?

58
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,661
Yes.

59
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,115
What are you afraid of?

60
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,564
Anne-Marie Stretter.

61
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:48,560
They would dance in the evening

62
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,813
They're dancing.

63
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,538
What are you crying about?

64
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,544
I love you...

65
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:40,065
...to the point of not seeing...

66
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,299
...not hearing...

67
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:45,572
...dying.

68
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:47,691
Lepers burst like sacks of dust,
you know.

69
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:53,415
- Don't suffer?
- No, feel nothing.

70
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,591
She's there by the Ganges,
under the trees.

71
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:33,490
She has forgotten.

72
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:38,504
- The French Vice-Consul from Lahore.
- Yes.

73
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,834
Sent to Calcutta in disgrace.

74
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,288
He's come back to the grounds?

75
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:31,491
Yes.

76
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,135
He comes every night.

77
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,884
The tennis court, deserted.

78
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,924
Anne-Marie Stretter's red bicycle.

79
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:51,559
Where is the one in black?

80
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,530
Out driving.

81
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,939
She comes back with the night.

82
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,549
The black Lancia
has just entered the grounds.

83
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,461
She hunts at night
in the depths of the Ganges.

84
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,232
For food.

85
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:09,299
Dead on the islands

86
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:16,710
- Her eyes pierced with light, dead.
- Yes.

87
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:19,313
Beneath that stone.

88
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:23,571
Around her, a bend in the Ganges...

89
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:09,752
Four o'clock.
Darkest night.

90
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,913
- No one's asleep?
- No one.

91
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,159
What heat!

92
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,721
Impossible.

93
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,082
Terrible.

94
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:29,033
Another storm...

95
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:32,207
...coming to Bengal...

96
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,882
...coming from the islands.

97
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:39,666
From the estuaries, inexhaustible...

98
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:54,295
- What's that sound?
- Her, crying.

99
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:00,886
- She isn't suffering, is she?
- No.

100
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:05,103
Leprosy.
Leprosy of the heart.

101
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:18,150
- Can't bear it?
- No, can't bear it.

102
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,367
India, can't bear it.

103
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:35,373
She's sleeping.

104
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:49,351
He loved her more than
anything in the world.

105
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,910
More than that.

106
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:59,684
Michael Richardson set up a marine
insurance business...

107
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:03,370
...in Bengal,
to stay with her in India.

108
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,298
Listen...

109
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,523
The Ganges fishermen.

110
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,434
What a night!

111
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,796
What heat!

112
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:42,405
All-embracing...

113
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,766
Deathly...

114
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:55,490
From behind the plants in the bar
she watches them.

115
00:22:57,054 --> 00:22:59,314
Only at dawn...

116
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:04,299
...when the lovers went toward
the door of the ballroom...

117
00:23:05,506 --> 00:23:08,598
...did Lola Valérie Stein
utter a cry.

118
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:14,116
Didn't hear anything else.

119
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,766
Didn't see anything else.

120
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,681
This crime in her past.

121
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,918
Yes.

122
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:30,517
Rain.

123
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,126
Yes.

124
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,276
Cool.

125
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,732
Her music,
that was Venice.

126
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,733
A promising artist.

127
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:07,748
- Never gave up playing?
- Never.

128
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:22,731
Ana Maria Guardi.

129
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,308
Yes.

130
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,525
The first marriage?

131
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,298
- The first post?
- Savannakhet, Laos.

132
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:47,094
To a French colonial civil servant.
She's 18.

133
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:50,635
Oh yes, a river...

134
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,911
...already...

135
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,429
...she's sitting by a river,

136
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,358
and she's looking.

137
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,728
The Mekong.

138
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,192
- She's silent? Crying?
- Yes.

139
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,296
They say:
"She won't get used to it".

140
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,536
"She'll have to be
sent back to Europe. "

141
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:16,526
- She couldn't bear it, already?
- Already.

142
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,732
Caught behind gates.

143
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:23,999
The government house grounds

144
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,944
- Those sentries?
- The guard.

145
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,688
- Already couldn't bear it.
- No.

146
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:41,962
One day,
a government launch stops...

147
00:25:43,295 --> 00:25:47,252
...Monsieur Stretter is
inspecting the Mekong posts.

148
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:52,910
- Takes her away to Savannakhet?
- Yes, takes her with him.

149
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:57,866
For 17 years,
through the capitals of Asia.

150
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:02,944
You find her in Peking,
again in Mandalay.

151
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,297
In Bangkok...
you find her in Bangkok.

152
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,592
In Rangoon...
In Sydney.

153
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,548
You find her in Lahore...

154
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,835
17 years.

155
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,500
She's in Calcutta...
Calcutta...

156
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,841
She dies.

157
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,836
- Who's the other man?
- A friend passing through.

158
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:35,608
A friend of Stretter.

159
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:39,376
Whoever wants her, has her.

160
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,251
He gives her.

161
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:46,088
- Love.
- Yes.

162
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,929
Splendor.

163
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,050
"Anne-Marie Stretter"
written on the grave?

164
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,564
"Ana Maria Guardi",

165
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:02,989
but worn away.

166
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:19,007
Every night...

167
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,808
...looks at her.

168
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:28,969
- Has never spoken to her?
- Never.

169
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:33,012
Never approached any woman.

170
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:40,321
- The male virgin of Lahore.
- Yes.

171
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,964
- Those gleams over there?
- The burning ghats.

172
00:28:43,385 --> 00:28:45,902
Burning those who died of hunger?

173
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:47,762
Yes.

174
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,647
It's dawn.

175
00:29:02,428 --> 00:29:04,129
He had fired a gun in Lahore.

176
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,460
One night, from his balcony,

177
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,692
he fired on the lepers
of the Shalimar Gardens.

178
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,222
- Couldn't bear it?
- No.

179
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,184
- India, couldn't bear it?
- No.

180
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:22,658
What about India?

181
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:26,428
The idea.

182
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:41,790
There was a reception
at the French embassy?

183
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,519
Yes.

184
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,131
The park stretches down
to the Ganges.

185
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,865
The offices are on this side.
You see? Those grey buildings.

186
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:14,636
Farther away, the tennis courts,
deserted during the monsoon.

187
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,220
Almost no one is dancing?

188
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:21,540
In this heat,
how could you?

189
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:25,117
The only remedy, immobility.

190
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,448
Slowness...
Slow down the blood.

191
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:31,857
The smell of mud.
Insipid.

192
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:35,516
The Ganges, low tide.

193
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:01,965
The new Austrian attaché.

194
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,631
Been here a month.

195
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,547
- He can't get used to India.
- His first time here?

196
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:11,509
Yes.

197
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:14,518
He'll come again.

198
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,336
- He'll go to the islands.
- How can you tell?

199
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:22,348
The anguish in his eyes.

200
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,111
She can't bear people
who get used to India.

201
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:30,149
The Ambassador asks people
to the islands for his wife.

202
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,863
She goes alone to the islands.

203
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:36,899
The Ambassador goes hunting
in Nepal.

204
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,164
They say her lovers are English,

205
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:43,423
don't mix with the embassies,
and that the Ambassador knows.

206
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,048
A friend of the Stretters'.

207
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,761
Unknown in Calcutta.

208
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:15,566
With this humidity
the pianos are detuned.

209
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:23,215
The French Vice-Consul
has just entered the park.

210
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,675
At the last minute
she sent him a card: "Come".

211
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:30,729
Just what did he do?

212
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:35,099
The worst... killed.

213
00:32:35,627 --> 00:32:38,616
- In Lahore.
- The official version?

214
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:42,727
Nerves gave way.
Often happens.

215
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,899
- Easy to say.
- Yes.

216
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:52,998
His face... as if grafted.

217
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,280
Very pale.

218
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,158
She could have spared us
his presence.

219
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,471
An outcast in Lahore too?

220
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:06,537
There too.

221
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,720
He just escaped being dismissed.

222
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,888
The ambassador intervened.

223
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:19,127
Closed circles in India
make me think of leprosy.

224
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:36,860
- Perhaps he drank? - No. Drunkenness is
the same for us all here.

225
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,064
We talk about going home.

226
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,265
No, he didn't drink.

227
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,593
The Ambassador
asked the young attaché

228
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:51,108
to have a word with him.

229
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,413
He tries.

230
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:57,605
He turns away.
Can't bear it.

231
00:33:58,315 --> 00:34:00,558
Any of it.

232
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:06,602
He laughs.

233
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:10,287
As if he were suddenly
mad with joy.

234
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:12,781
Look...

235
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:18,156
Perhaps he's just seen
Madame Stretter... perhaps.

236
00:34:19,752 --> 00:34:24,284
- You mean...
- I wonder... perhaps.

237
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,852
Did he talk about Lahore?

238
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:37,669
Only to her.
Near dawn.

239
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:43,509
He fired at night,
on the Shalimar Gardens...

240
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,831
...on lepers, dogs.

241
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:52,942
But they found bullets in the mirrors
in his house in Lahore, too.

242
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,895
Shooting at himself...

243
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:03,628
Roses arrived every day from Nepal.

244
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:08,212
She gave them out
at the end of the ball.

245
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:15,723
After lunch, people sink...
Heavy sleep.

246
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:19,131
Yet everyone waits
for something like that.

247
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:24,099
Storms are expected.
Just a hole in the sky.

248
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:26,949
It fills in straight away.

249
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,387
How white she is!

250
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:40,058
How white they are,
the women of Calcutta!

251
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:44,398
For six months,
out only in the evening

252
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,459
Fleeing the sun.

253
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,940
Seems imprisoned
in a kind of suffering.

254
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:02,772
No one really knows
what goes on behind these walls.

255
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,143
What she does.

256
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,568
Cycling very early in the morning,

257
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,353
in the grounds.

258
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:14,322
Playing tennis,
She reads, they say.

259
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:17,875
Parcels of books
come from Venice for her.

260
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,178
She goes to the islands.

261
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:23,443
Appearances...

262
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:46,016
Only one person sees him.
The director of the European club.

263
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:48,109
A drunkard.

264
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:54,280
All he said to the director
was repeated to the Ambassador.

265
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:57,202
- It's horrid!
- You don't understand.

266
00:36:57,894 --> 00:37:02,595
He knew it would be repeated.
That's why he spoke to the director.

267
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:07,572
A way to reach her,
this woman.

268
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:15,111
He said he was entitled
to Madame Stretter's attentions,

269
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:17,402
to her love,

270
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:19,756
as much as the others...

271
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:23,565
Her lovers from Calcutta...

272
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:31,645
At night, near the tennis courts...

273
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:34,544
...this bicycle...

274
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:39,825
He says:
"A thing she had touched".

275
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:43,814
No...

276
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:47,368
...that can't be repeated.

277
00:37:57,293 --> 00:38:00,233
Of this passion,
she said nothing.

278
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:02,411
Nothing.

279
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:12,667
He said he regretted not making
a convincing report of Lahore.

280
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:15,946
Convincing?

281
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,447
I remember the word.

282
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,975
- What's known of his background?
- Lived in Neuilly.

283
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:25,559
Father worked in a bank.

284
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:30,406
Mother left the father, then died.

285
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:34,858
Expelled from various schools...
At 15, a disciplinary school.

286
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,329
An aunt writes sometimes.

287
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:44,579
Look at his eyes.

288
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:46,892
He's crying.

289
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:50,024
He seems unaware of it.

290
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:57,548
He seems to be in a state...
of tears.

291
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,291
What do you want?

292
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:01,037
To talk to you.

293
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,470
What about?

294
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,647
Your next post.

295
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:11,099
The voice is toneless,
as if he was trying not to shout.

296
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:14,125
You can't get used to it either?

297
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:19,143
No. the heat, of course...

298
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,095
...but also the monotony.

299
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,085
The light...

300
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,953
...no colour.

301
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:36,004
But you...
before Lahore...

302
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,141
...would you have preferred
something else?

303
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,314
No.

304
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:45,572
Lahore was what I wanted.

305
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,321
Come to the bar.

306
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:54,490
What are you afraid of?

307
00:40:57,876 --> 00:41:00,318
They say you'd like Bombay.

308
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,871
I wish to stay in Calcutta.

309
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:06,793
I don't think that's possible.

310
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:09,904
Then leave it to
the Consular Service.

311
00:41:11,697 --> 00:41:13,608
They can send me
where they like.

312
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,840
Bombay is less crowded.
The climate is better.

313
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,646
The nearness of the sea
is an advantage.

314
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:28,205
I haven't asked to see my file.

315
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:32,486
What does it say?

316
00:41:33,747 --> 00:41:36,228
That Lahore...

317
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,515
...what you did in Lahore...

318
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:45,779
People can't understand.
No matter how hard they try.

319
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,117
No one.

320
00:41:50,278 --> 00:41:51,935
No one?

321
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,738
What are you doing?
Come along.

322
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:11,107
I'm listening to "India Song".

323
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,454
I came to India
because of "India Song".

324
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:31,236
That tune makes me
want to love.

325
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,554
I have never loved.

326
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:49,358
I had never loved anyone.

327
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:18,915
He saw himself photographed, in a
rocking chair by the Gulf of Oman.

328
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:21,966
Then, one morning...

329
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,896
...on the way to his office,
he saw her in the park...

330
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:28,292
...by the tennis courts...

331
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,318
...in white.

332
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,172
What a story!
What passion!

333
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:35,783
He left everything for her.

334
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:41,143
Some close friends stayed
after the reception.

335
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,705
The passion sometimes...

336
00:43:46,442 --> 00:43:49,421
Those European suicides
that increase with the hunger

337
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:51,060
that they never suffer...

338
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:56,114
In its internal law,
that culpability of the West...

339
00:43:58,165 --> 00:43:59,993
It is absurd, clear.

340
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:04,305
Shanghai... Did you see
the photos of the bombing?

341
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:08,799
The first attempt in Savannakhet...

342
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:12,072
...because of a dead body,

343
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:15,119
abandoned by its mother,
a beggar from the north,

344
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,813
in the government house grounds...

345
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,687
...outside her room...

346
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:31,833
No woman in Lahore
knew him enough...

347
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,882
...to shed any light on...

348
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:38,003
- No woman.
- How terrible!

349
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:42,877
No one has ever
visited him in Lahore.

350
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,395
That's how he wanted to be,
a virgin alone,

351
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:50,376
waiting for love.

352
00:44:57,922 --> 00:45:01,914
Death all around you,
never quite reaching you.

353
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,894
What are you talking about?

354
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,542
The Vice-Consul who is
looking for Madame Stretter.

355
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:12,785
She has been leaving receptions

356
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:15,278
more and more often.

357
00:45:56,486 --> 00:45:59,146
It was bound to happen.
Look...

358
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:02,652
He is going over to
Madame Stretter.

359
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,805
Did you see?

360
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:08,515
How subtle!

361
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,106
How cleverly he saved his wife...

362
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:16,471
- Where are they going?
- Into the second drawing room.

363
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:20,575
Sooner or later the Ambassador
had to talk with him.

364
00:46:20,892 --> 00:46:22,513
So you see...

365
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:27,524
He's asked for champagne.

366
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:38,847
If I've got it right,
you'd like Bombay?

367
00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:43,355
But in Bombay you couldn't
have the same job as Lahore.

368
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:46,868
It's still too soon.

369
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,213
If you stay here for a while,
people will forget.

370
00:46:56,143 --> 00:46:58,327
Or I can keep you in Calcutta.

371
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:00,353
Yes.

372
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,511
A strange thing, a career.

373
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:09,400
If you forget Lahore,
so will others.

374
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:11,400
I won't forget Lahore.

375
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:18,420
There are remedies...

376
00:47:19,577 --> 00:47:22,293
...for this sort of nervousness,

377
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:24,811
as it is called.

378
00:47:25,957 --> 00:47:28,285
- You know.
- No!

379
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:34,212
At the beginning, everyone,
myself included...

380
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,856
...we feel the same.

381
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,418
It's a question of finding,

382
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:42,827
inventing...

383
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,491
...a way of looking at things.

384
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,200
I haven't.

385
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:52,977
I see nothing.

386
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:56,090
Go back to Paris.

387
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:59,496
No...
It's impossible.

388
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:19,655
The Mekong, at Savannakhet,

389
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:23,728
flowing yellow between
forest and rice fields.

390
00:48:25,156 --> 00:48:28,288
In those days
the launches were slow.

391
00:48:28,587 --> 00:48:30,466
It took days...

392
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:36,120
At sunset, the mosquitoes...
We couldn't see a thing.

393
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:39,157
Black clusters on the netting.

394
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:42,053
The Ambassador wrote poetry.

395
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:46,160
- It's said she discouraged it.
- The banks can't be seen when it rains.

396
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:48,641
The sky is low.

397
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:51,483
The water, muddy.

398
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:57,127
When he met her, she was so young,
and he, already...

399
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:01,208
They're great friends.

400
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:05,185
He took her away from Savannakhet?

401
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:07,322
No one knows.

402
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:10,877
She courted death in Savannakhet.

403
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,419
So young.

404
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:15,108
You must come with us
to the islands.

405
00:49:16,464 --> 00:49:18,676
The Embassy villa
was built a long time ago.

406
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:20,735
It's worth seeing.

407
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:23,567
And also the islands
of the delta.

408
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:25,624
I'd be pleased to come.

409
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:38,707
Perhaps what she did was music...

410
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:45,247
...behind those walls.
Prisoner of that suffering, so old.

411
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,001
Painless.

412
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:51,055
A leprosy of the heart.

413
00:49:54,377 --> 00:49:58,790
Yet sometimes, in the grounds,
those tears...

414
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:02,757
The light of the monsoon...

415
00:50:03,912 --> 00:50:06,125
...so harsh...

416
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:10,079
...and her eyes so clear
that tears...

417
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:27,613
Tell me about her.

418
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,894
Irreproachable.

419
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:32,713
Here that means...

420
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:36,482
...nothing that you can see.

421
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:45,533
After Venice,
she gave no more concerts?

422
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:48,728
No, never.

423
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,455
Have they met?

424
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:07,674
They must have seen each other
in the grounds.

425
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:18,591
What is he looking at?

426
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,305
Madame Stretter,
dancing with the young attaché.

427
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,565
Listen carefully,
to her voice, the accent.

428
00:51:49,749 --> 00:51:52,244
Perhaps that's what
makes her seem distant.

429
00:51:52,644 --> 00:51:57,359
- That origin.
- Yes, maybe that too...

430
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:04,668
I wish I were you...

431
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:08,926
...arriving here for the first time,
with the rains.

432
00:52:11,305 --> 00:52:13,278
You aren't bored?

433
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:16,639
What do you do in the evenings?

434
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:19,545
On Sundays?

435
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:22,074
I read, sleep.

436
00:52:22,444 --> 00:52:24,289
I don't really know.

437
00:52:25,758 --> 00:52:28,801
Boredom, of course,
is so personal.

438
00:52:29,038 --> 00:52:31,224
It's hard to give advice.

439
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:34,362
I don't think I'm bored.

440
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,892
Then again, it may not be
as serious as they say.

441
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:47,518
Thank you for sending the
parcels of books up so promptly.

442
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:50,455
A pleasure.

443
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:58,146
You know, one could say

444
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,851
almost nothing is
possible in India.

445
00:53:01,814 --> 00:53:03,419
What do you mean?

446
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:07,127
Nothing.

447
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:10,429
That this general despondency...

448
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,354
It's neither painful nor pleasant
to live in India.

449
00:53:17,878 --> 00:53:20,091
Neither easy nor difficult.

450
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:22,929
It's nothing.

451
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:25,065
You see?
Nothing.

452
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:33,382
You mean it's impossible?

453
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:38,623
Well... perhaps, yes.

454
00:53:39,225 --> 00:53:42,882
But then, you know it's probably
an over-simplification.

455
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:49,638
The Vice-Consul is looking at you.

456
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,560
He's been doing so all evening.

457
00:53:56,517 --> 00:53:58,194
You didn't notice?

458
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,537
Where is he hoping to be posted?

459
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:06,755
Here in Calcutta.

460
00:54:08,057 --> 00:54:09,541
Really?

461
00:54:12,062 --> 00:54:14,206
I thought you knew already.

462
00:54:30,246 --> 00:54:32,051
They say you're Venetian.

463
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:38,078
My father was French.
My mother was from Venice.

464
00:54:38,304 --> 00:54:40,208
I kept her name.

465
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:44,008
At first, I would have said English.

466
00:54:44,855 --> 00:54:46,432
That happens.

467
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:53,032
Are there any
who never get used to it?

468
00:54:58,008 --> 00:55:00,625
Almost everyone does.

469
00:55:12,173 --> 00:55:15,739
Did my husband mention the islands?

470
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,124
I'd be pleased to come.

471
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,853
You write, I believe?

472
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:29,117
I once thought I could.

473
00:55:29,985 --> 00:55:31,578
Did someone tell you?

474
00:55:32,055 --> 00:55:34,168
Yes. But I would have guessed.

475
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:37,562
Your way of being silent.

476
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:40,250
I gave it up.

477
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:43,739
Monsieur Stretter used to write?

478
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,708
He used to, yes. He too,
and then...

479
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:51,445
And you?

480
00:55:52,323 --> 00:55:54,269
I never tried.

481
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:58,500
You think it's not worth it,
don't you?

482
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:04,302
Well... Yes, if you like.

483
00:56:05,785 --> 00:56:07,456
You play music?

484
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:11,266
Sometimes.

485
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:13,884
Less, in the last few years.

486
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,068
Why?

487
00:56:19,297 --> 00:56:21,333
Hard to put into words.

488
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:25,678
Tell me.

489
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,650
A sort of pain
is linked to music...

490
00:56:32,087 --> 00:56:34,387
...for some time now, for me.

491
00:56:37,684 --> 00:56:41,481
In Venice, already, very young,
18 years old,

492
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:45,179
music,
to the point of madness.

493
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:50,426
Until a sort of suicide,
already.

494
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:54,444
She says she no longer knows
how to play.

495
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,317
What's happening?

496
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,271
The Vice-Consul is dancing
with the Spanish ambassador's wife.

497
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:04,261
He's talking of leprosy.

498
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:10,686
Will you have to dance with him?

499
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,305
I don't have to do anything, but...

500
00:57:18,212 --> 00:57:20,448
He was here last night...

501
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:22,653
...near the tennis courts.

502
00:57:23,308 --> 00:57:25,033
He sleeps badly.

503
00:57:25,918 --> 00:57:28,739
- She broke away from him...
- What happened?

504
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,881
Something he said,

505
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,613
must have frightened her.

506
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:35,567
What do people fear?

507
00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:38,908
Repulsion is a feeling
you know nothing about.

508
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:43,443
I don't understand.

509
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:46,505
What do you mean?

510
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,650
Horror...

511
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:58,376
Come to the bar.

512
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:00,879
I'm an old friend
of Madame Stretter.

513
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:03,293
We've not met.
George Crown.

514
00:58:03,945 --> 00:58:05,706
Help yourselves.

515
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,099
There's no one at the bar.

516
00:58:08,537 --> 00:58:12,920
- His words are a diversion.
- Ready to flee.

517
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,535
And yet...

518
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,976
He's still looking at you.

519
00:58:18,656 --> 00:58:21,144
Seems she doesn't dare
go out in the park.

520
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,360
What is he talking about
with that man from the club?

521
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:30,258
Childhood. And her,
the French Ambassador's wife.

522
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:32,921
Why is he waiting to leave?

523
00:58:33,086 --> 00:58:36,089
To be thrown out, probably.

524
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,064
- The mad beggar woman.
- The one who laughs.

525
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,366
It is said she's from Laos

526
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,400
It doesn't seem possible...

527
00:58:46,909 --> 00:58:50,428
- A beggar woman is in the grounds.
- I Know.

528
00:58:50,932 --> 00:58:53,013
The one who sings.
Don't you know her?

529
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:56,400
But no, you're new to Calcutta.

530
00:58:58,565 --> 00:59:02,357
She sings, I believe,
a song from Savannakhet.

531
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,276
In Laos.

532
00:59:06,468 --> 00:59:08,333
She intrigues us.

533
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,452
I keep thinking
it can't be possible.

534
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:15,639
We're thousands of miles
from Indochina.

535
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:18,735
How could she?

536
00:59:21,033 --> 00:59:25,185
I've heard her in the avenue,
early in the morning.

537
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:28,794
It's a happy song.

538
00:59:29,576 --> 00:59:31,439
Children sing it over there.

539
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:36,898
She must have come down
the river valleys.

540
00:59:39,347 --> 00:59:42,573
But how did she manage
to cross the Cardamoms?

541
00:59:44,729 --> 00:59:46,333
She's completely mad.

542
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:50,342
Yes. But she's alive

543
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,272
She comes to the islands sometimes.

544
00:59:54,948 --> 00:59:56,234
How?

545
00:59:57,323 --> 00:59:58,835
No one knows.

546
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:02,108
Perhaps she follows you.

547
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,789
Follows the whites.

548
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:09,486
That happens. For food.

549
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:59,724
- Where is he?
- By the bar.

550
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:02,625
Drinks too much.
It'll end badly.

551
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:10,454
We could see him at night
through the window of his room.

552
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:12,227
Pacing...

553
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,636
Pacing, day and night.

554
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:18,013
Day and night.

555
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,182
He'd call down death
on Lahore.

556
01:02:22,551 --> 01:02:24,104
And fire.

557
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:26,092
He shouted too.

558
01:02:26,502 --> 01:02:28,321
Disconnected words.

559
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:31,162
And laughed.

560
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:41,960
Isn't there in each of us
a chance, just one...

561
01:02:42,314 --> 01:02:44,390
...of being like him in Lahore?

562
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:48,680
But one knows about leprosy
before coming. One knows.

563
01:03:15,048 --> 01:03:19,619
Perhaps he thought the gardens
were empty. In that light...

564
01:03:19,858 --> 01:03:21,675
...that fog...

565
01:03:24,687 --> 01:03:28,283
Look at the sky... sick.

566
01:03:28,863 --> 01:03:34,066
That thickness... that dirt,
throughout the night.

567
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:37,383
He said he wanted leprosy.

568
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,966
He is anger itself.

569
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:42,826
Against whom?
Against what?

570
01:03:43,142 --> 01:03:45,748
Doesn't need a reason.

571
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:00,860
They're dancing.
Look.

572
01:04:01,162 --> 01:04:03,248
She's always loved dancing.

573
01:04:07,237 --> 01:04:12,285
Some months ago, in Chandernagore,
they were found in a cheap hotel.

574
01:04:12,858 --> 01:04:14,878
Trying to die together.

575
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:21,807
Hard to believe.

576
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,896
An ambulance back to Calcutta.

577
01:04:27,635 --> 01:04:29,628
The truth came out in the end.

578
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:37,649
For no reason, they say.
"Indifference to life".

579
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:41,399
Or the opposite.

580
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:44,345
People confuse things.

581
01:04:44,997 --> 01:04:48,801
No. There's a definite equivalence.

582
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,056
The same appearances.

583
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:08,367
People always talked about her...

584
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:10,562
...a great deal.

585
01:05:11,303 --> 01:05:12,795
About that love.

586
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:16,738
And the islands.

587
01:05:17,572 --> 01:05:19,476
The delta islands.

588
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:24,373
That's all they'll miss of India.

589
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:27,499
What would they have done
without them?

590
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:31,454
About heat.

591
01:05:32,383 --> 01:05:33,815
About fear.

592
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:37,281
Leprosy, and hunger.

593
01:05:39,756 --> 01:05:42,156
About the Vice-Consul
from Lahore...

594
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,197
...those dead...

595
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,118
About that sweetness...

596
01:05:48,456 --> 01:05:50,413
We wondered:

597
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,445
All those books...

598
01:05:54,272 --> 01:05:57,169
...those sleepless nights
in the delta.

599
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:01,464
Those tears?

600
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,614
India Song...

601
01:06:10,868 --> 01:06:14,775
On his way to the office,
he whistled India Song.

602
01:06:19,238 --> 01:06:21,276
He said to the club director:

603
01:06:21,548 --> 01:06:26,253
"At home in Neuilly, in the drawing room,
there's a black piano. "

604
01:06:26,555 --> 01:06:29,239
"India Song is on the music-rest. "

605
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:31,420
"My mother played it. "

606
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:33,826
"The score has been there
since she died. "

607
01:06:36,506 --> 01:06:39,258
Day already.
No one speaks.

608
01:06:39,825 --> 01:06:41,612
They seem to be waiting.

609
01:06:43,484 --> 01:06:45,540
The tennis courts were deserted.

610
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:47,973
A bicycle was there.

611
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:51,526
I noticed they were deserted,

612
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,783
after she'd gone.

613
01:06:54,288 --> 01:06:56,864
The air was torn apart.

614
01:06:57,904 --> 01:07:00,377
Her skirt, against the trees.

615
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:03,697
She looked at me.

616
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:46,196
I didn't know you existed.

617
01:07:52,011 --> 01:07:54,963
Calcutta has become
a form of hope for me.

618
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:53,361
I love Michael Richardson.

619
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:56,347
I'm not free of that love.

620
01:08:57,787 --> 01:08:59,386
I know.

621
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:04,564
I love you like that,
in that love.

622
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,213
It doesn't matter.

623
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:12,785
I sound odd.

624
01:09:14,386 --> 01:09:16,218
Do you hear my voice?

625
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,132
It frightens them.

626
01:09:20,185 --> 01:09:21,453
Yes.

627
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:23,862
Who is she?

628
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,188
I shot myself in Laos,
but didn't die.

629
01:09:33,428 --> 01:09:37,646
The others separate me from Lahore.
I don't.

630
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:40,711
Lahore is me.

631
01:09:42,632 --> 01:09:44,296
You understand too?

632
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:48,458
Yes. Don't shout.

633
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:51,563
Yes.

634
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:56,768
You are with me, with Lahore.

635
01:09:57,724 --> 01:09:59,250
I know it.

636
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:02,546
You are in me.

637
01:10:04,915 --> 01:10:06,715
I'll take you away inside me.

638
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:11,872
We shall fire on
the Shalimar lepers.

639
01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:13,554
You can't avoid it.

640
01:10:19,455 --> 01:10:23,187
I didn't need to dance with you
to know you.

641
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:25,770
And you know it.

642
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:30,668
I know it.

643
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,988
There's no need for us to go on.

644
01:10:43,536 --> 01:10:45,088
We have nothing to say
to each other.

645
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:48,832
We are the same.

646
01:10:53,027 --> 01:10:55,448
I believe that.

647
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:01,860
Have love affairs with others.

648
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:05,024
We don't need that.

649
01:11:11,613 --> 01:11:14,410
I wanted to know
the smell of your hair.

650
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,734
That explains why I...

651
01:11:25,475 --> 01:11:28,604
After the reception,
your friends will stay on.

652
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:31,760
I wish I could stay
with you once.

653
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:36,594
There's no chance.

654
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,864
They'd throw me out.

655
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,505
Yes. You are someone
they have to forget.

656
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:50,128
Like Lahore.

657
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:51,788
Yes.

658
01:11:53,757 --> 01:11:55,454
What will become of me?

659
01:11:57,484 --> 01:12:00,048
You'll be posted
far from Calcutta.

660
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:02,817
That's what you want?

661
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,762
Yes.

662
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:10,133
Very well.

663
01:12:12,012 --> 01:12:14,238
When will it end?

664
01:12:17,061 --> 01:12:19,222
With your death, I believe.

665
01:12:23,315 --> 01:12:25,564
What's this pain?
My pain?

666
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:30,900
Intelligence.

667
01:12:31,736 --> 01:12:33,409
About you?

668
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:39,911
I'll ask them
to let me stay tonight.

669
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,440
Do what you like.

670
01:12:45,022 --> 01:12:49,242
To make something happen
between you and me.

671
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,266
A public incident.

672
01:12:53,825 --> 01:12:55,515
All I know how to do
is shout.

673
01:12:57,523 --> 01:13:00,651
Let them know
love can be shouted.

674
01:13:02,451 --> 01:13:04,869
They'll be uncomfortable.

675
01:13:06,906 --> 01:13:08,973
Then start talking again.

676
01:13:19,217 --> 01:13:22,897
I even know
you'll tell no one you agreed.

677
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,335
Let me stay!

678
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:10,214
I'm going to stay
here tonight! With her!

679
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,936
Just once, with her!

680
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:16,329
Do you hear?

681
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,736
- What is it?
- Better do something.

682
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:22,184
How terrible.

683
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:24,241
Bound to happen.

684
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:28,124
I'm staying!

685
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:33,364
I'm going to stay
in the French Embassy!

686
01:14:35,648 --> 01:14:38,804
I'm going to the islands with her!

687
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:43,541
I beg you!

688
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:49,142
I beg you!
Let me stay!

689
01:14:50,728 --> 01:14:53,746
- Dreadful!
- It's terrible.

690
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,220
And she just stands still.

691
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:02,309
Once!

692
01:15:02,996 --> 01:15:06,093
Just once!

693
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:12,341
I've never loved anyone but her!

694
01:15:13,354 --> 01:15:16,136
Do go home.
You've had too much to drink.

695
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,203
He did it deliberately.

696
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,416
No sense of...

697
01:15:32,818 --> 01:15:34,407
What happened?

698
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:39,431
How strange.

699
01:15:40,854 --> 01:15:42,435
Indecent.

700
01:15:42,711 --> 01:15:44,659
Impossible to understand.

701
01:15:45,256 --> 01:15:46,893
It's terrible.

702
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:55,984
How dreadful!

703
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,696
They've got him.

704
01:16:00,174 --> 01:16:02,017
He's not resisting.

705
01:16:09,953 --> 01:16:13,002
He's outside. Locked out.

706
01:16:17,383 --> 01:16:19,564
Laughing and crying.
Did you see?

707
01:16:24,691 --> 01:16:26,612
He's forcing the gate.

708
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:31,430
The beggars are afraid.

709
01:16:37,777 --> 01:16:39,447
He's gone.

710
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:48,017
- Now all is clear.
- What?

711
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:49,415
Lahore.

712
01:16:51,447 --> 01:16:53,103
He's still shouting.

713
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,080
Where is she?

714
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,847
- In the drawing room.
- With him.

715
01:17:04,483 --> 01:17:07,352
In a way,
everyone should cry.

716
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,903
- Don't you think?
- But...

717
01:17:10,309 --> 01:17:11,872
It's a manner of speaking.

718
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:28,119
Is that the Vice-Consul
of France shouting?

719
01:27:28,687 --> 01:27:31,657
Yes.
Still shouting.

720
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:36,063
After the trip to the islands,
he drops out of sight.

721
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:39,728
He tenders his resignation.

722
01:27:40,843 --> 01:27:43,016
The file ends
with his resignation.

723
01:27:43,863 --> 01:27:45,535
Soon after?

724
01:27:46,455 --> 01:27:47,819
A few days.

725
01:27:56,092 --> 01:27:57,572
What's he saying?

726
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,631
Her Venetian name
in deserted Calcutta.

727
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:06,816
The whole night
he shouted that name.

728
01:28:28,405 --> 01:28:31,127
That sound of wings, of birds?

729
01:28:32,559 --> 01:28:33,720
Day.

730
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:37,868
Sunrise, here.

731
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:41,347
There... and beyond.

732
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:46,739
The air smells of mud.
And leprosy.

733
01:28:47,342 --> 01:28:48,822
And fire.

734
01:28:50,095 --> 01:28:52,956
- Not a breath of air?
- No.

735
01:28:54,259 --> 01:28:56,227
Only very small movements...

736
01:28:57,188 --> 01:28:59,284
...very slow wafts...

737
01:29:00,289 --> 01:29:01,806
...of odour.

738
01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:19,491
The sun.

739
01:29:20,427 --> 01:29:23,588
What light!
Awful!

740
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:28,173
Yes.
Exile.

741
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:32,221
She's listless.

742
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:36,646
Yes.
Deeply absent.

743
01:29:41,727 --> 01:29:44,107
The heat is rust-coloured.

744
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,531
Above, smoke.

745
01:29:47,736 --> 01:29:49,112
The factories.

746
01:29:57,714 --> 01:30:00,935
This continent, suspended?

747
01:30:01,258 --> 01:30:04,846
The monsoon.
Below, Bengal.

748
01:30:06,243 --> 01:30:07,864
Further.

749
01:30:08,182 --> 01:30:09,639
Lower.

750
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:11,705
Beneath the sky.

751
01:30:12,326 --> 01:30:13,617
Look...

752
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:18,008
In a bend of the Ganges.

753
01:30:18,628 --> 01:30:20,248
That whiteness.

754
01:30:21,105 --> 01:30:22,489
Over there.

755
01:30:24,246 --> 01:30:25,822
The English cemetery.

756
01:30:39,998 --> 01:30:42,458
A car is speeding along
the straight roads,

757
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,727
by the Ganges.

758
01:30:45,076 --> 01:30:47,093
They've left for the islands.

759
01:30:57,767 --> 01:31:00,409
- Those junks?
- Rice.

760
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:03,870
On the slopes,
those dark patches?

761
01:31:04,198 --> 01:31:05,434
People.

762
01:31:05,634 --> 01:31:07,930
The highest density in the world.

763
01:31:15,696 --> 01:31:20,074
- Those dark mirrors, thousands of them?
- The rice fields of India.

764
01:31:30,586 --> 01:31:32,714
The black Lancia has stopped.

765
01:31:33,663 --> 01:31:35,196
The rain.

766
01:31:35,464 --> 01:31:36,844
The roads are flooded.

767
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:40,699
They took shelter in a sala.

768
01:31:41,802 --> 01:31:43,699
There, the young attaché said:

769
01:31:44,114 --> 01:31:46,347
"I saw the Vice-Consul
before I left".

770
01:31:46,672 --> 01:31:50,430
He was still shouting in the streets.
He asked if I was going to the islands.

771
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:54,287
I said I was going to Nepal
with the Ambassador.

772
01:31:56,404 --> 01:31:59,000
Did she approve of the lie?

773
01:32:01,783 --> 01:32:05,791
She hardly ever mentioned
the man from Lahore.

774
01:32:24,226 --> 01:32:26,148
That green colour.

775
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,591
It's growing larger.

776
01:32:28,863 --> 01:32:30,258
The ocean.

777
01:32:37,854 --> 01:32:39,306
The islands.

778
01:32:40,391 --> 01:32:41,882
Which one is it?

779
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:44,242
The largest.

780
01:32:44,695 --> 01:32:46,114
The central island.

781
01:32:47,262 --> 01:32:49,027
They've arrived.

782
01:32:50,768 --> 01:32:52,915
That white palace?

783
01:32:53,361 --> 01:32:55,158
The Prince of Wales,

784
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:57,399
an international hotel.

785
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:09,731
The sea is rough.
There's been a storm.

786
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:18,355
In front, the piers.

787
01:33:18,937 --> 01:33:21,733
Those ships sail
the South Pacific.

788
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:25,093
Behind, berths for yachts.

789
01:33:26,115 --> 01:33:29,295
Through the trees,
the same flat horizon.

790
01:33:29,962 --> 01:33:32,015
The islands are alluvial.

791
01:33:32,827 --> 01:33:34,369
The mud of the Ganges.

792
01:33:36,922 --> 01:33:39,082
Where's the French Embassy villa?

793
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:43,009
Beyond the hotel,
facing the ocean.

794
01:33:45,774 --> 01:33:47,980
She wanted to swim
when she arrived?

795
01:33:48,529 --> 01:33:49,837
Yes.

796
01:33:50,515 --> 01:33:52,680
It was late,
The sea rough.

797
01:33:53,368 --> 01:33:55,329
It was impossible to swim,

798
01:33:55,717 --> 01:33:58,778
Just let the warm waves
break over her.

799
01:33:59,339 --> 01:34:01,074
She bathed with him.

800
01:34:02,838 --> 01:34:05,229
Those nets everywhere in the sea?

801
01:34:06,403 --> 01:34:08,287
Against the delta sharks.

802
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:21,910
Where is she?

803
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,023
She'll come.

804
01:34:25,075 --> 01:34:26,463
She's coming.

805
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,641
- That evening, was she the same?
- Smiling.

806
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:37,338
Dressed in white.

807
01:34:57,084 --> 01:34:58,872
Who comes to the hotel?

808
01:34:59,788 --> 01:35:01,544
White India.

809
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,064
I can't quite remember.

810
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,427
Didn't she go to the
Embassy villa?

811
01:35:23,365 --> 01:35:25,124
She only slept there.

812
01:35:25,946 --> 01:35:28,939
She dined at the Prince of Wales,
when she went to the islands.

813
01:35:31,008 --> 01:35:33,996
She had the villa's servants

814
01:35:34,503 --> 01:35:36,212
sent back to Calcutta.

815
01:35:37,759 --> 01:35:41,269
- How long ago?
- A few weeks.

816
01:36:14,857 --> 01:36:17,637
- India Song.
- Yes.

817
01:36:43,805 --> 01:36:47,612
- There's dancing in the lounge.
- Tourists from Ceylon.

818
01:36:52,119 --> 01:36:53,484
These birds?

819
01:36:54,504 --> 01:36:56,982
Prisoners of the island,
because of the storm.

820
01:36:58,078 --> 01:36:59,698
They're in the mango trees.

821
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:01,787
They strip them.

822
01:37:02,706 --> 01:37:04,471
They'll fly at dawn.

823
01:37:13,289 --> 01:37:16,234
This sudden smell of death?

824
01:37:16,857 --> 01:37:18,361
Incense.

825
01:37:41,885 --> 01:37:44,254
He had come on the last boat?

826
01:37:45,206 --> 01:37:47,888
Yes, the 7 o'clock boat.

827
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:52,624
He hadn't been home all day.

828
01:37:53,836 --> 01:37:55,713
He never went back to Calcutta.

829
01:38:44,954 --> 01:38:48,270
When the mist came,
the wind dropped.

830
01:38:58,261 --> 01:39:00,326
She had the blinds raised.

831
01:39:06,779 --> 01:39:10,031
She wants to see
the ocean, the sky

832
01:39:10,429 --> 01:39:12,200
above the estuaries.

833
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:17,319
They are very tired,
after last night.

834
01:39:19,392 --> 01:39:21,085
She is looking outside.

835
01:39:23,445 --> 01:39:24,981
I remember...

836
01:39:25,536 --> 01:39:28,174
...a wall of mist comes in
toward the islands.

837
01:39:28,447 --> 01:39:29,572
Yes.

838
01:39:30,764 --> 01:39:33,201
She says something about Venice.

839
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:37,017
Venice in the winter.

840
01:39:37,706 --> 01:39:39,183
Yes, that's right.

841
01:39:40,408 --> 01:39:42,901
- Venice?
- Yes.

842
01:39:44,367 --> 01:39:46,623
Perhaps certain winter evenings,

843
01:39:47,332 --> 01:39:50,489
in Venice,
the same mist.

844
01:39:52,377 --> 01:39:55,877
She's saying the name of a colour.

845
01:39:56,374 --> 01:39:57,807
Violet.

846
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,740
The colour of the delta mist.

847
01:40:17,383 --> 01:40:19,757
It was a September evening...

848
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:23,769
...during the summer monsoon...

849
01:40:27,414 --> 01:40:29,014
...on the islands...

850
01:40:33,667 --> 01:40:35,847
...in 1937.

851
01:40:41,534 --> 01:40:45,451
In China, the war went on.

852
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:48,891
Shanghai had just been bombed.

853
01:40:50,032 --> 01:40:52,253
The Japanese were still advancing.

854
01:40:54,345 --> 01:40:57,058
In Spain,

855
01:40:57,411 --> 01:40:59,408
they were still fighting.

856
01:41:00,811 --> 01:41:02,696
The Republic is strangled.

857
01:41:04,584 --> 01:41:08,129
In Russia,
the Revolution is betrayed.

858
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,697
The Congress of Nuremberg
had just taken place.

859
01:41:17,778 --> 01:41:22,358
Already, the beggar woman was hunting
in the warm waters of the delta.

860
01:41:59,075 --> 01:42:02,512
Michael Richardson and
the young guest

861
01:42:02,753 --> 01:42:04,324
had gone across
the beach to the villa.

862
01:42:10,823 --> 01:42:13,348
The other two
had gone sailing.

863
01:42:25,246 --> 01:42:26,979
She had wanted
to go back alone,

864
01:42:28,128 --> 01:42:29,924
along the inland paths.

865
01:42:33,757 --> 01:42:37,039
Behind her,
the Vice-Consul of Lahore.

866
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,128
He followed her to the park.

867
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:56,275
Michael Richardson and the young guest
had arrived after her.

868
01:43:04,215 --> 01:43:06,828
She had gone to meet them
in the park.

869
01:43:10,304 --> 01:43:12,372
They move toward one another.

870
01:43:12,817 --> 01:43:14,613
They meet.

871
01:43:19,689 --> 01:43:21,732
They seem to be talking.

872
01:43:25,793 --> 01:43:27,838
They go toward the villa.

873
01:44:04,478 --> 01:44:06,380
Once they had tried...

874
01:44:07,948 --> 01:44:10,158
...tried to die together.

875
01:44:11,353 --> 01:44:13,158
Without succeeding.

876
01:44:14,586 --> 01:44:16,220
In a brothel,

877
01:44:17,049 --> 01:44:18,550
in Chandernagore.

878
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:21,566
They'd been discovered.

879
01:44:43,175 --> 01:44:47,114
At one point in the night,
she brings them champagne.

880
01:44:48,614 --> 01:44:50,099
Glasses.

881
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:52,163
She serves them.

882
01:45:30,024 --> 01:45:31,521
It's still night

883
01:45:32,245 --> 01:45:35,142
when Michael Richardson
takes away the young guest.

884
01:45:35,978 --> 01:45:37,936
Tears himself away from that place.

885
01:45:38,951 --> 01:45:40,626
Leaves her there.

886
01:46:09,615 --> 01:46:11,004
Later,

887
01:46:11,304 --> 01:46:15,167
music was heard
around the Embassy villa.

888
01:47:32,516 --> 01:47:35,891
The lovers of the Ganges had promised
to let each other be free,

889
01:47:36,226 --> 01:47:40,999
if ever either of them
decided to die.

890
01:49:58,062 --> 01:50:02,094
The young guest came back
to the villa during the night.

891
01:50:03,195 --> 01:50:06,559
Yes.
He saw her.

892
01:50:07,932 --> 01:50:09,897
She was lying in the park,

893
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:12,665
leaning on one elbow.
He said:

894
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:17,234
"She stretched out her arm
and put her head on it. "

895
01:50:21,042 --> 01:50:23,881
"The Vice-Consul of Lahore
was ten yards away. "

896
01:50:25,017 --> 01:50:26,722
They didn't speak to each other. "

897
01:50:28,146 --> 01:50:31,965
She must have stayed there
a long time. Till daylight.

898
01:50:33,177 --> 01:50:35,269
Then she must have taken the path.

899
01:50:39,464 --> 01:50:42,288
On the beach
they found the dressing gown.

900
01:50:48,963 --> 01:50:51,846
And the heat was once more
the heat of Calcutta.
