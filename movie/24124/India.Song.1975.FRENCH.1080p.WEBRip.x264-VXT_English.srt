1
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:33,957
A beggar woman.

2
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,462
- Mad?
- Yes.

3
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,673
Ah yes. I remember.

4
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:43,576
She follows the rivers.

5
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:46,759
Comes from Burma.

6
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:12,761
Not Indian.
She comes from Savannakhet.

7
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:15,617
Born there.

8
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:19,883
Walking...

9
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:22,187
For ten years.

10
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:27,258
And one day,
in front of her, the Ganges.

11
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,092
- Yes.
- She stays.

12
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,667
That's right.

13
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,331
12 children dead
while she walked towards Bengal?

14
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,948
Yes.

15
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:47,597
She leaves them.
Sells them, forgets them.

16
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,622
On the way to Bengal,
she goes barren

17
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:06,966
- Savannakhet, Laos?
- Yes.

18
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,071
At seventeen.

19
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:13,501
Pregnant... seventeen...

20
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,287
thrown out by her mother,
goes away...

21
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,176
asks the way to get lost.

22
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:25,873
No one knows.

23
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:57,604
In Calcutta they were together.

24
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:02,181
- She and the white woman?
- Yes.

25
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:05,430
During the same years...

26
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:23,972
- He had followed her to India.
- Yes.

27
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,610
For her, he left everything.

28
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:29,425
Overnight.

29
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,741
- The night of the ball?
- Yes.

30
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:40,572
Michael Richardson was engaged
to a girl from S. Thala,

31
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,190
Lola Valerie Stein.

32
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:51,799
They were to marry in the autumn.

33
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,129
Then, the ball,

34
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,228
The ball at S. Thala.

35
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,494
She arrived late...

36
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,485
in the middle of the night...

37
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,909
in black.

38
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,425
That ball, such love...

39
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,963
such desire.

40
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,153
That light?

41
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:27,090
The monsoon.

42
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:30,339
That dust?

43
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,892
Central Calcutta.

44
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,541
What is that scent of flowers?

45
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:45,758
Leprosy.

46
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,975
Where are we?

47
00:06:56,065 --> 00:07:00,112
The French Embassy, in India.

48
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:06,333
- That murmur?
- The Ganges.

49
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:20,412
When she died, he left India?

50
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:22,265
Yes.

51
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,281
Her grave is in the English cemetery?

52
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:29,955
Yes.

53
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,044
- She died out there?
- On the islands.

54
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,220
Found dead one night.

55
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,423
A black Lancia...

56
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,177
speeds along the road
to Chandernagore.

57
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,617
It was there that she first tried?

58
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,861
Yes.

59
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:48,315
What are you afraid of?

60
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,764
Anne-Marie Stretter.

61
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:01,460
They would dance in the evening

62
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:05,713
They're dancing.

63
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,438
What are you crying about?

64
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:50,444
I love you...

65
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:52,965
to the point of not seeing...

66
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,199
not hearing...

67
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:58,472
dying.

68
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:00,591
Lepers burst like sacks of dust,
you know.

69
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:06,315
- Don't suffer?
- No, feel nothing.

70
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,491
She's there by the Ganges,
under the trees.

71
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,390
She has forgotten.

72
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:51,204
- The French Vice-Consul from Lahore.
- Yes.

73
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,534
Sent to Calcutta in disgrace.

74
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,988
He's come back to the grounds?

75
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:44,191
Yes.

76
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,835
He comes every night.

77
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,584
The tennis court, deserted.

78
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:24,624
Anne-Marie Stretter's red bicycle.

79
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:57,859
Where is the one in black?

80
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,830
Out driving.

81
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,239
She comes back with the night.

82
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,849
The black Lancia
has just entered the grounds.

83
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:57,761
She hunts at night
in the depths of the Ganges.

84
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:00,532
For food.

85
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:15,299
Dead on the islands

86
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,710
- Her eyes pierced with light, dead.
- Yes.

87
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,313
Beneath that stone.

88
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:29,571
Around her, a bend in the Ganges...

89
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:15,752
Four o'clock.
Darkest night.

90
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,913
- No one's asleep?
- No one.

91
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,159
What heat!

92
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,721
Impossible.

93
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:31,082
Terrible.

94
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,033
Another storm...

95
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:38,207
coming to Bengal...

96
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,882
coming from the islands.

97
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:45,666
From the estuaries, inexhaustible...

98
00:19:55,124 --> 00:20:00,295
- What's that sound?
- Her, crying.

99
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:06,886
- She isn't suffering, is she?
- No.

100
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,003
Leprosy.
Leprosy of the heart.

101
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:23,750
- Can't bear it?
- No, can't bear it.

102
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:26,967
India, can't bear it.

103
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,273
She's sleeping.

104
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,251
He loved her more than
anything in the world.

105
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:57,810
More than that.

106
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:05,584
Michael Richardson set up a marine
insurance business...

107
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:09,270
in Bengal,
to stay with her in India.

108
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,098
Listen...

109
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,323
The Ganges fishermen.

110
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:41,234
What a night!

111
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,596
What heat!

112
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,205
All-embracing...

113
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,566
Deathly...

114
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:01,290
From behind the plants in the bar
she watches them.

115
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:05,114
Only at dawn...

116
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,099
when the lovers went toward
the door of the ballroom...

117
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,398
did Lola Valérie Stein
utter a cry.

118
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,916
Didn't hear anything else.

119
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:22,566
Didn't see anything else.

120
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:25,481
This crime in her past.

121
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,718
Yes.

122
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:36,317
Rain.

123
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,926
Yes.

124
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:40,076
Cool.

125
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:03,532
Her music, that was Venice.

126
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,533
A promising artist.

127
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:13,548
- Never gave up playing?
- Never.

128
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:28,531
Ana Maria Guardi.

129
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,108
Yes.

130
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,325
The first marriage?

131
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:46,098
- The first post?
- Savannakhet, Laos.

132
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,894
To a French colonial civil servant.
She's 18.

133
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,435
Oh yes, a river...

134
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,711
already...

135
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,229
she's sitting by a river,

136
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:04,158
and she's looking.

137
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,528
The Mekong.

138
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:11,992
- She's silent? Crying?
- Yes.

139
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:15,096
They say:
"She won't get used to it".

140
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,336
"She'll have to be
sent back to Europe."

141
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:22,326
- She couldn't bear it, already?
- Already.

142
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:26,532
Caught behind gates.

143
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,799
The government house grounds

144
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:33,744
- Those sentries?
- The guard.

145
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:39,488
- Already couldn't bear it.
- No.

146
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:47,762
One day,
a government launch stops...

147
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:52,752
Monsieur Stretter is
inspecting the Mekong posts.

148
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:58,410
- Takes her away to Savannakhet?
- Yes, takes her with him.

149
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:03,366
For 17 years,
through the capitals of Asia.

150
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,444
You find her in Peking,
again in Mandalay.

151
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:12,797
In Bangkok...
you find her in Bangkok.

152
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:16,092
In Rangoon...
In Sydney.

153
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,048
You find her in Lahore...

154
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,335
17 years.

155
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:27,000
She's in Calcutta...
Calcutta...

156
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,341
She dies.

157
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:38,336
- Who's the other man?
- A friend passing through.

158
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,108
A friend of Stretter.

159
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,876
Whoever wants her, has her.

160
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,751
He gives her.

161
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:51,588
- Love.
- Yes.

162
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,429
Splendor.

163
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,550
"Anne-Marie Stretter"
written on the grave?

164
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,064
"Ana Maria Guardi",

165
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,489
but worn away.

166
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:24,507
Every night...

167
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,308
looks at her.

168
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:34,469
- Has never spoken to her?
- Never.

169
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:38,512
Never approached any woman.

170
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,821
- The male virgin of Lahore.
- Yes.

171
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,464
- Those gleams over there?
- The burning ghats.

172
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:51,402
Burning those who died of hunger?

173
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:53,262
Yes.

174
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,147
It's dawn.

175
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:09,629
He had fired a gun in Lahore.

176
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:12,960
One night, from his balcony,

177
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:16,192
he fired on the lepers
of the Shalimar Gardens.

178
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,722
- Couldn't bear it?
- No.

179
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:24,684
- India, couldn't bear it?
- No.

180
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:28,158
What about India?

181
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,928
The idea.

182
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:52,490
There was a reception
at the French embassy?

183
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:54,219
Yes.

184
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,831
The park stretches down
to the Ganges.

185
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,565
The offices are on this side.
You see? Those Grey buildings.

186
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:25,336
Farther away, the tennis courts,
deserted during the monsoon.

187
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,920
Almost no one is dancing?

188
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,240
In this heat, how could you?

189
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:35,817
The only remedy, immobility.

190
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,148
Slowness...
Slow down the blood.

191
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:42,557
The smell of mud.
Insipid.

192
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:46,216
The Ganges, low tide.

193
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,665
The new Austrian attaché.

194
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,331
Been here a month.

195
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,247
- He can't get used to India.
- His first time here?

196
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:22,209
Yes.

197
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,218
He'll come again.

198
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,036
- He'll go to the islands.
- How can you tell?

199
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:33,048
The anguish in his eyes.

200
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,811
She can't bear people
who get used to India.

201
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:40,849
The Ambassador asks people
to the islands for his wife.

202
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:44,563
She goes alone to the islands.

203
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:47,599
The Ambassador goes hunting
in Nepal.

204
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:49,864
They say her lovers are English,

205
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:54,123
don't mix with the embassies,
and that the Ambassador knows.

206
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:02,748
A friend of the Stretters'.

207
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,461
Unknown in Calcutta.

208
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:26,166
With this humidity
the pianos are detuned.

209
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:33,815
The French Vice-Consul
has just entered the park.

210
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,275
At the last minute
she sent him a card: "Come".

211
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:41,329
Just what did he do?

212
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:45,699
The worst... killed.

213
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:49,216
- In Lahore.
- The official version?

214
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:53,327
Nerves gave way.
Often happens.

215
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:56,499
- Easy to say.
- Yes.

216
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:03,598
His face... as if grafted.

217
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,880
Very pale.

218
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,758
She could have spared us
his presence.

219
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,071
An outcast in Lahore too?

220
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,137
There too.

221
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:20,320
He just escaped being dismissed.

222
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:23,488
The ambassador intervened.

223
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:29,727
Closed circles in India
make me think of leprosy.

224
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:47,460
- Perhaps he drank? - No. Drunkenness is
the same for us all here.

225
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,664
We talk about going home.

226
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:52,865
No, he didn't drink.

227
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:58,193
The Ambassador
asked the young attaché

228
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,708
to have a word with him.

229
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,013
He tries.

230
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:08,205
He turns away.
Can't bear it.

231
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:11,158
Any of it.

232
00:34:15,598 --> 00:34:17,202
He laughs.

233
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:20,887
As if he were suddenly
mad with joy.

234
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:23,381
Look...

235
00:34:24,923 --> 00:34:28,756
Perhaps he's just seen
Madame Stretter... perhaps.

236
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:34,884
- You mean...
- I wonder... perhaps.

237
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,452
Did he talk about Lahore?

238
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:48,269
Only to her.
Near dawn.

239
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:53,909
He fired at night,
on the Shalimar Gardens...

240
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:57,231
on lepers, dogs.

241
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:03,342
But they found bullets in the mirrors
in his house in Lahore, too.

242
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:07,295
Shooting at himself...

243
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:14,028
Roses arrived every day from Nepal.

244
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:18,612
She gave them out
at the end of the ball.

245
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:26,123
After lunch, people sink...
Heavy sleep.

246
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,531
Yet everyone waits
for something like that.

247
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:34,499
Storms are expected.
Just a hole in the sky.

248
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:37,349
It fills in straight away.

249
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,787
How white she is!

250
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:50,458
How white they are,
the women of Calcutta!

251
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,798
For six months,
out only in the evening

252
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:56,859
Fleeing the sun.

253
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:06,340
Seems imprisoned
in a kind of suffering.

254
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:13,172
No one really knows
what goes on behind these walls.

255
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,543
What she does.

256
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,968
Cycling very early in the morning,

257
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:20,753
in the grounds.

258
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:24,722
Playing tennis,
She reads, they say.

259
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,275
Parcels of books
come from Venice for her.

260
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,578
She goes to the islands.

261
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,843
Appearances...

262
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:56,416
Only one person sees him.
The director of the European club.

263
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:58,509
A drunkard.

264
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:04,680
All he said to the director
was repeated to the Ambassador.

265
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:07,602
- It's horrid!
- You don't understand.

266
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:12,995
He knew it would be repeated.
That's why he spoke to the director.

267
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:17,772
A way to reach her, this woman.

268
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:25,311
He said he was entitled
to Madame Stretter's attentions,

269
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:27,602
to her love,

270
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,956
as much as the others...

271
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,765
Her lovers from Calcutta...

272
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:41,845
At night, near the tennis courts...

273
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:44,744
this bicycle...

274
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:50,025
He says:
"A thing she had touched".

275
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:54,014
No...

276
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,568
that can't be repeated.

277
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,433
Of this passion,
she said nothing.

278
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:12,611
Nothing.

279
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:22,867
He said he regretted not making
a convincing report of Lahore.

280
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,146
Convincing?

281
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,647
I remember the word.

282
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,175
- What's known of his background?
- Lived in Neuilly.

283
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,759
Father worked in a bank.

284
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:40,606
Mother left the father, then died.

285
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:45,058
Expelled from various schools...
At 15, a disciplinary school.

286
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,529
An aunt writes sometimes.

287
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,779
Look at his eyes.

288
00:38:55,604 --> 00:38:57,092
He's crying.

289
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:00,224
He seems unaware of it.

290
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:07,748
He seems to be in a state...
of tears.

291
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,491
What do you want?

292
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,237
To talk to you.

293
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,670
What about?

294
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,847
Your next post.

295
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:21,299
The voice is toneless,
as if he was trying not to shout.

296
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:24,325
You can't get used to it either?

297
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:29,343
No. the heat, of course...

298
00:40:31,035 --> 00:40:33,295
but also the monotony.

299
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,285
The light...

300
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,153
no colour.

301
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:46,204
But you...
before Lahore...

302
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:50,341
would you have preferred
something else?

303
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,514
No.

304
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:55,772
Lahore was what I wanted.

305
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,521
Come to the bar.

306
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,690
What are you afraid of?

307
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,518
They say you'd like Bombay.

308
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:14,071
I wish to stay in Calcutta.

309
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,993
I don't think that's possible.

310
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:20,104
Then leave it to
the Consular Service.

311
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,808
They can send me
where they like.

312
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,040
Bombay is less crowded.
The climate is better.

313
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:31,846
The nearness of the sea
is an advantage.

314
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:38,405
I haven't asked to see my file.

315
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,686
What does it say?

316
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:46,428
That Lahore...

317
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,715
what you did in Lahore...

318
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:55,979
People can't understand.
No matter how hard they try.

319
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:58,317
No one.

320
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,135
No one?

321
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:15,938
What are you doing?
Come along.

322
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:21,307
I'm listening to "India Song".

323
00:42:29,037 --> 00:42:31,654
I came to India
because of "India Song".

324
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:41,436
That tune makes me want to love.

325
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:54,754
I have never loved.

326
00:42:57,629 --> 00:42:59,558
I had never loved anyone.

327
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:28,915
He saw himself photographed, in a
rocking chair by the Gulf of Oman.

328
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:31,966
Then, one morning...

329
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:35,896
on the way to his office,
he saw her in the park...

330
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:38,292
by the tennis courts...

331
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:40,318
in white.

332
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:43,172
What a story!
What passion!

333
00:43:43,418 --> 00:43:45,783
He left everything for her.

334
00:43:48,264 --> 00:43:51,143
Some close friends stayed
after the reception.

335
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,705
The passion sometimes...

336
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:59,421
Those European suicides
that increase with the hunger

337
00:43:59,714 --> 00:44:01,060
that they never suffer...

338
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:06,114
In its internal law,
that culpability of the West...

339
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:09,993
It is absurd, clear.

340
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:14,305
Shanghai... Did you see
the photos of the bombing?

341
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:18,799
The first attempt in Savannakhet...

342
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,072
because of a dead body,

343
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:25,119
abandoned by its mother,
a beggar from the north,

344
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:27,813
in the government house grounds...

345
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,687
outside her room...

346
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,833
No woman in Lahore
knew him enough...

347
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,882
to shed any light on...

348
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:48,003
- No woman.
- How terrible!

349
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:52,877
No one has ever
visited him in Lahore.

350
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,395
That's how he wanted to be,
a virgin alone,

351
00:44:58,454 --> 00:45:00,376
waiting for love.

352
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:11,914
Death all around you,
never quite reaching you.

353
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,894
What are you talking about?

354
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:17,542
The Vice-Consul who is
looking for Madame Stretter.

355
00:45:20,778 --> 00:45:22,785
She has been leaving receptions

356
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:25,278
more and more often.

357
00:46:06,986 --> 00:46:09,646
It was bound to happen.
Look...

358
00:46:10,155 --> 00:46:13,152
He is going over to
Madame Stretter.

359
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,305
Did you see?

360
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:19,015
How subtle!

361
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,606
How cleverly he saved his wife...

362
00:46:23,768 --> 00:46:26,971
- Where are they going?
- Into the second drawing room.

363
00:46:27,295 --> 00:46:31,075
Sooner or later the Ambassador
had to talk with him.

364
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:33,013
So you see...

365
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:38,024
He's asked for champagne.

366
00:46:45,964 --> 00:46:49,347
If I've got it right,
you'd like Bombay?

367
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:53,855
But in Bombay you couldn't
have the same job as Lahore.

368
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:57,368
It's still too soon.

369
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,713
If you stay here for a while,
people will forget.

370
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:08,827
Or I can keep you in Calcutta.

371
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:10,853
Yes.

372
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,011
A strange thing, a career.

373
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:19,900
If you forget Lahore,
so will others.

374
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:21,900
I won't forget Lahore.

375
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:28,920
There are remedies...

376
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:32,793
for this sort of nervousness,

377
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:35,311
as it is called.

378
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,785
- You know.
- No!

379
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:44,712
At the beginning, everyone,
myself included...

380
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,356
we feel the same.

381
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,918
It's a question of finding,

382
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:53,327
inventing...

383
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,991
a way of looking at things.

384
00:47:57,957 --> 00:47:59,700
I haven't.

385
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:03,477
I see nothing.

386
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:06,590
Go back to Paris.

387
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,996
No...
It's impossible.

388
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:30,155
The Mekong, at Savannakhet,

389
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,228
flowing yellow between
forest and rice fields.

390
00:48:35,656 --> 00:48:38,788
In those days
the launches were slow.

391
00:48:39,087 --> 00:48:40,966
It took days...

392
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:46,620
At sunset, the mosquitoes...
We couldn't see a thing.

393
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:49,657
Black clusters on the netting.

394
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:52,553
The Ambassador wrote poetry.

395
00:48:52,832 --> 00:48:56,660
- It's said she discouraged it.
- The banks can't be seen when it rains.

396
00:48:57,462 --> 00:48:59,141
The sky is low.

397
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:01,983
The water, muddy.

398
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:07,627
When he met her, she was so young,
and he, already...

399
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:11,708
They're great friends.

400
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:15,685
He took her away from Savannakhet?

401
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:17,822
No one knows.

402
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:21,377
She courted death in Savannakhet.

403
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:22,919
So young.

404
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:25,608
You must come with us
to the islands.

405
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,176
The Embassy villa
was built a long time ago.

406
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:31,235
It's worth seeing.

407
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:34,067
And also the islands
of the delta.

408
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:36,124
I'd be pleased to come.

409
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:49,207
Perhaps what she did was music...

410
00:49:50,516 --> 00:49:55,747
behind those walls.
Prisoner of that suffering, so old.

411
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,501
Painless.

412
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:01,555
A leprosy of the heart.

413
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:09,290
Yet sometimes, in the grounds,
those tears...

414
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:13,257
The light of the monsoon...

415
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,625
so harsh...

416
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:20,579
and her eyes so clear
that tears...

417
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:38,113
Tell me about her.

418
00:50:39,446 --> 00:50:41,394
Irreproachable.

419
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:43,213
Here that means...

420
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:46,982
nothing that you can see.

421
00:50:52,981 --> 00:50:56,033
After Venice,
she gave no more concerts?

422
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:59,228
No, never.

423
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:12,955
Have they met?

424
00:51:15,857 --> 00:51:18,174
They must have seen each other
in the grounds.

425
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:29,091
What is he looking at?

426
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,805
Madame Stretter,
dancing with the young attaché.

427
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,865
Listen carefully,
to her voice, the accent.

428
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:02,544
Perhaps that's what
makes her seem distant.

429
00:52:02,944 --> 00:52:07,659
- That origin.
- Yes, maybe that too...

430
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:14,968
I wish I were you...

431
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:19,226
arriving here for the first time,
with the rains.

432
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,578
You aren't bored?

433
00:52:24,695 --> 00:52:26,939
What do you do in the evenings?

434
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:29,845
On Sundays?

435
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:32,374
I read, sleep.

436
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:34,589
I don't really know.

437
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:39,101
Boredom, of course,
is so personal.

438
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:41,524
It's hard to give advice.

439
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:44,662
I don't think I'm bored.

440
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,192
Then again, it may not be
as serious as they say.

441
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:57,818
Thank you for sending the
parcels of books up so promptly.

442
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,755
A pleasure.

443
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:08,446
You know, one could say

444
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:11,151
almost nothing is
possible in India.

445
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:13,719
What do you mean?

446
00:53:16,178 --> 00:53:17,427
Nothing.

447
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,729
That this general despondency...

448
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,654
It's neither painful nor pleasant
to live in India.

449
00:53:28,178 --> 00:53:30,391
Neither easy nor difficult.

450
00:53:31,632 --> 00:53:33,229
It's nothing.

451
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:35,365
You see?
Nothing.

452
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:43,682
You mean it's impossible?

453
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:48,923
Well... perhaps, yes.

454
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:53,182
But then, you know it's probably
an over-simplification.

455
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:59,738
The Vice-Consul is looking at you.

456
00:54:02,296 --> 00:54:04,660
He's been doing so all evening.

457
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,294
You didn't notice?

458
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,637
Where is he hoping to be posted?

459
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:16,855
Here in Calcutta.

460
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:19,641
Really?

461
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,306
I thought you knew already.

462
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:42,151
They say you're Venetian.

463
00:54:44,643 --> 00:54:48,178
My father was French.
My mother was from Venice.

464
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:50,308
I kept her name.

465
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:54,108
At first, I would have said English.

466
00:54:54,955 --> 00:54:56,532
That happens.

467
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:03,132
Are there any
who never get used to it?

468
00:55:08,108 --> 00:55:10,725
Almost everyone does.

469
00:55:22,273 --> 00:55:25,839
Did my husband mention the islands?

470
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:29,224
I'd be pleased to come.

471
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,953
You write, I believe?

472
00:55:36,122 --> 00:55:39,217
I once thought I could.

473
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:41,678
Did someone tell you?

474
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:44,268
Yes. But I would have guessed.

475
00:55:45,273 --> 00:55:47,562
Your way of being silent.

476
00:55:48,653 --> 00:55:50,250
I gave it up.

477
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:53,739
Monsieur Stretter used to write?

478
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,708
He used to, yes. He too,
and then...

479
00:55:59,908 --> 00:56:01,445
And you?

480
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:04,269
I never tried.

481
00:56:06,194 --> 00:56:08,500
You think it's not worth it,
don't you?

482
00:56:10,673 --> 00:56:14,302
Well... Yes, if you like.

483
00:56:15,785 --> 00:56:17,456
You play music?

484
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:21,266
Sometimes.

485
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:23,884
Less, in the last few years.

486
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:26,068
Why?

487
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:31,433
Hard to put into words.

488
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,778
Tell me.

489
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:41,750
A sort of pain
is linked to music...

490
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:44,487
for some time now, for me.

491
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:51,581
In Venice, already, very young,
18 years old,

492
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:55,279
music, to the point of madness.

493
00:56:55,644 --> 00:57:00,526
Until a sort of suicide,
already.

494
00:57:01,378 --> 00:57:04,544
She says she no longer knows
how to play.

495
00:57:06,451 --> 00:57:08,417
What's happening?

496
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:12,371
The Vice-Consul is dancing
with the Spanish ambassador's wife.

497
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,361
He's talking of leprosy.

498
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,786
Will you have to dance with him?

499
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,405
I don't have to do anything, but...

500
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,548
He was here last night...

501
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:32,753
near the tennis courts.

502
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,133
He sleeps badly.

503
00:57:36,018 --> 00:57:38,839
- She broke away from him...
- What happened?

504
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,981
Something he said,

505
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,713
must have frightened her.

506
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,667
What do people fear?

507
00:57:45,812 --> 00:57:49,008
Repulsion is a feeling
you know nothing about.

508
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:53,543
I don't understand.

509
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:56,605
What do you mean?

510
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,750
Horror...

511
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:07,976
Come to the bar.

512
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:10,479
I'm an old friend
of Madame Stretter.

513
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:12,893
We've not met.
George Crown.

514
00:58:13,545 --> 00:58:15,306
Help yourselves.

515
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,699
There's no one at the bar.

516
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:22,520
- His words are a diversion.
- Ready to flee.

517
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,135
And yet...

518
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,576
He's still looking at you.

519
00:58:28,256 --> 00:58:30,744
Seems she doesn't dare
go out in the park.

520
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:35,960
What is he talking about
with that man from the club?

521
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:39,858
Childhood. And her,
the French Ambassador's wife.

522
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:42,521
Why is he waiting to leave?

523
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,689
To be thrown out, probably.

524
00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:50,664
- The mad beggar woman.
- The one who laughs.

525
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,966
It is said she's from Laos

526
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,000
It doesn't seem possible...

527
00:58:56,509 --> 00:59:00,028
- A beggar woman is in the grounds.
- I Know.

528
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:02,613
The one who sings.
Don't you know her?

529
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:06,000
But no, you're new to Calcutta.

530
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:11,957
She sings, I believe,
a song from Savannakhet.

531
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,876
In Laos.

532
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:17,933
She intrigues us.

533
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:22,052
I keep thinking
it can't be possible.

534
00:59:22,352 --> 00:59:25,239
We're thousands of miles
from Indochina.

535
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,335
How could she?

536
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:34,785
I've heard her in the avenue,
early in the morning.

537
00:59:36,765 --> 00:59:38,394
It's a happy song.

538
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,039
Children sing it over there.

539
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,498
She must have come down
the river valleys.

540
00:59:48,947 --> 00:59:52,173
But how did she manage
to cross the Cardamoms?

541
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,933
She's completely mad.

542
00:59:57,797 --> 00:59:59,942
Yes. But she's alive

543
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,872
She comes to the islands sometimes.

544
01:00:04,548 --> 01:00:05,834
How?

545
01:00:06,923 --> 01:00:08,435
No one knows.

546
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:11,708
Perhaps she follows you.

547
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:14,389
Follows the whites.

548
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:19,086
That happens. For food.

549
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,324
- Where is he?
- By the bar.

550
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:12,225
Drinks too much.
It'll end badly.

551
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:19,954
We could see him at night
through the window of his room.

552
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:21,727
Pacing...

553
01:02:21,996 --> 01:02:24,136
Pacing, day and night.

554
01:02:24,968 --> 01:02:27,513
Day and night.

555
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,682
He'd call down death on Lahore.

556
01:02:32,051 --> 01:02:33,604
And fire.

557
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,592
He shouted too.

558
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,821
Disconnected words.

559
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:40,662
And laughed.

560
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:51,460
Isn't there in each of us
a chance, just one...

561
01:02:51,814 --> 01:02:53,890
of being like him in Lahore?

562
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:58,180
But one knows about leprosy
before coming. One knows.

563
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:29,119
Perhaps he thought the gardens
were empty. In that light...

564
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:31,175
that fog...

565
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:37,783
Look at the sky... sick.

566
01:03:38,363 --> 01:03:43,566
That thickness... that dirt,
throughout the night.

567
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:46,883
He said he wanted leprosy.

568
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:49,466
He is anger itself.

569
01:03:49,818 --> 01:03:52,326
Against whom?
Against what?

570
01:03:52,642 --> 01:03:55,248
Doesn't need a reason.

571
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:10,160
They're dancing.
Look.

572
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:12,548
She's always loved dancing.

573
01:04:16,537 --> 01:04:21,585
Some months ago, in Chandernagore,
they were found in a cheap hotel.

574
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,178
Trying to die together.

575
01:04:29,185 --> 01:04:31,107
Hard to believe.

576
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,196
An ambulance back to Calcutta.

577
01:04:36,935 --> 01:04:38,928
The truth came out in the end.

578
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:46,949
For no reason, they say.
"Indifference to life".

579
01:04:48,743 --> 01:04:50,699
Or the opposite.

580
01:04:51,933 --> 01:04:53,645
People confuse things.

581
01:04:54,297 --> 01:04:58,101
No. There's a definite equivalence.

582
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:01,356
The same appearances.

583
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:17,567
People always talked about her...

584
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:19,762
a great deal.

585
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:21,995
About that love.

586
01:05:23,931 --> 01:05:25,938
And the islands.

587
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:28,676
The delta islands.

588
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:33,573
That's all they'll miss of India.

589
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,699
What would they have done
without them?

590
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:40,654
About heat.

591
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,015
About fear.

592
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:46,481
Leprosy, and hunger.

593
01:05:48,956 --> 01:05:51,356
About the Vice-Consul
from Lahore...

594
01:05:52,372 --> 01:05:54,397
those dead...

595
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,318
About that sweetness...

596
01:05:57,656 --> 01:05:59,613
We wondered:

597
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:02,645
All those books...

598
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:06,369
those sleepless nights
in the delta.

599
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,664
Those tears?

600
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:17,814
India Song...

601
01:06:20,068 --> 01:06:23,975
On his way to the office,
he whistled India Song.

602
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:30,476
He said to the club director:

603
01:06:30,748 --> 01:06:35,453
"At home in Neuilly, in the drawing room,
there's a black piano."

604
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:38,439
"India Song is on the music-rest."

605
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,620
"My mother played it."

606
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:43,026
"The score has been there
since she died."

607
01:06:45,706 --> 01:06:48,458
Day already.
No one speaks.

608
01:06:49,025 --> 01:06:50,812
They seem to be waiting.

609
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:54,740
The tennis courts were deserted.

610
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:57,173
A bicycle was there.

611
01:06:58,422 --> 01:07:00,726
I noticed they were deserted,

612
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:02,983
after she'd gone.

613
01:07:03,488 --> 01:07:06,064
The air was torn apart.

614
01:07:07,104 --> 01:07:09,577
Her skirt, against the trees.

615
01:07:11,273 --> 01:07:12,897
She looked at me.

616
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:55,196
I didn't know you existed.

617
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:03,963
Calcutta has become
a form of hope for me.

618
01:09:00,257 --> 01:09:02,361
I love Michael Richardson.

619
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:05,347
I'm not free of that love.

620
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:08,386
I know.

621
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:13,564
I love you like that,
in that love.

622
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:16,213
It doesn't matter.

623
01:09:20,497 --> 01:09:21,785
I sound odd.

624
01:09:23,386 --> 01:09:25,218
Do you hear my voice?

625
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:28,132
It frightens them.

626
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:30,453
Yes.

627
01:09:31,121 --> 01:09:32,862
Who is she?

628
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,188
I shot myself in Laos,
but didn't die.

629
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,646
The others separate me from Lahore.
I don't.

630
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:49,611
Lahore is me.

631
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:53,196
You understand too?

632
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,358
Yes. Don't shout.

633
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:00,463
Yes.

634
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:05,668
You are with me, with Lahore.

635
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:08,150
I know it.

636
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:11,446
You are in me.

637
01:10:13,815 --> 01:10:15,615
I'll take you away inside me.

638
01:10:18,175 --> 01:10:20,772
We shall fire on
the Shalimar lepers.

639
01:10:21,089 --> 01:10:22,454
You can't avoid it.

640
01:10:28,355 --> 01:10:32,087
I didn't need to dance with you
to know you.

641
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:34,670
And you know it.

642
01:10:38,182 --> 01:10:39,568
I know it.

643
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:46,888
There's no need for us to go on.

644
01:10:52,436 --> 01:10:53,988
We have nothing to say
to each other.

645
01:10:55,991 --> 01:10:57,732
We are the same.

646
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:04,348
I believe that.

647
01:11:06,724 --> 01:11:10,760
Have love affairs with others.

648
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,924
We don't need that.

649
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:23,310
I wanted to know
the smell of your hair.

650
01:11:24,877 --> 01:11:27,634
That explains why I...

651
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:37,504
After the reception,
your friends will stay on.

652
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:40,660
I wish I could stay
with you once.

653
01:11:43,936 --> 01:11:45,494
There's no chance.

654
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,764
They'd throw me out.

655
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,405
Yes. You are someone
they have to forget.

656
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,028
Like Lahore.

657
01:11:59,588 --> 01:12:00,688
Yes.

658
01:12:02,657 --> 01:12:04,354
What will become of me?

659
01:12:06,384 --> 01:12:08,948
You'll be posted
far from Calcutta.

660
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:11,717
That's what you want?

661
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,662
Yes.

662
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:19,033
Very well.

663
01:12:20,912 --> 01:12:23,138
When will it end?

664
01:12:25,961 --> 01:12:28,122
With your death, I believe.

665
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:34,464
What's this pain?
My pain?

666
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:39,800
Intelligence.

667
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:42,309
About you?

668
01:12:45,776 --> 01:12:48,811
I'll ask them
to let me stay tonight.

669
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,340
Do what you like.

670
01:12:53,922 --> 01:12:58,142
To make something happen
between you and me.

671
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,166
A public incident.

672
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:04,415
All I know how to do is shout.

673
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:09,551
Let them know
love can be shouted.

674
01:13:11,351 --> 01:13:13,769
They'll be uncomfortable.

675
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:17,873
Then start talking again.

676
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:31,797
I even know
you'll tell no one you agreed.

677
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,235
Let me stay!

678
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:19,114
I'm going to stay
here tonight! With her!

679
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,836
Just once, with her!

680
01:14:23,513 --> 01:14:25,229
Do you hear?

681
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:28,636
- What is it?
- Better do something.

682
01:14:29,536 --> 01:14:31,084
How terrible.

683
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:33,141
Bound to happen.

684
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:37,024
I'm staying!

685
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:42,264
I'm going to stay
in the French Embassy!

686
01:14:44,548 --> 01:14:47,704
I'm going to the islands with her!

687
01:14:49,321 --> 01:14:52,441
I beg you!

688
01:14:52,998 --> 01:14:58,042
I beg you!
Let me stay!

689
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,646
- Dreadful!
- It's terrible.

690
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,120
And she just stands still.

691
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:10,909
Once!

692
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:14,693
Just once!

693
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:20,941
I've never loved anyone but her!

694
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:24,736
Do go home.
You've had too much to drink.

695
01:15:35,222 --> 01:15:37,803
He did it deliberately.

696
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,016
No sense of...

697
01:15:41,418 --> 01:15:43,007
What happened?

698
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,031
How strange.

699
01:15:49,454 --> 01:15:51,035
Indecent.

700
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:53,259
Impossible to understand.

701
01:15:53,856 --> 01:15:55,493
It's terrible.

702
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:04,584
How dreadful!

703
01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:08,296
They've got him.

704
01:16:08,774 --> 01:16:10,617
He's not resisting.

705
01:16:18,553 --> 01:16:21,602
He's outside. Locked out.

706
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,164
Laughing and crying.
Did you see?

707
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,212
He's forcing the gate.

708
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,030
The beggars are afraid.

709
01:16:46,377 --> 01:16:48,047
He's gone.

710
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,617
- Now all is clear.
- What?

711
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,015
Lahore.

712
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:01,703
He's still shouting.

713
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:05,680
Where is she?

714
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,447
- In the drawing room.
- With him.

715
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:15,952
In a way, everyone should cry.

716
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,503
- Don't you think?
- But...

717
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:20,472
It's a manner of speaking.

718
01:27:33,787 --> 01:27:36,319
Is that the Vice-Consul
of France shouting?

719
01:27:36,887 --> 01:27:39,857
Yes.
Still shouting.

720
01:27:41,645 --> 01:27:44,263
After the trip to the islands,
he drops out of sight.

721
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:47,928
He tenders his resignation.

722
01:27:49,043 --> 01:27:51,216
The file ends
with his resignation.

723
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:53,735
Soon after?

724
01:27:54,655 --> 01:27:56,019
A few days.

725
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:05,772
What's he saying?

726
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,831
Her Venetian name
in deserted Calcutta.

727
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:15,016
The whole night
he shouted that name.

728
01:28:36,605 --> 01:28:39,327
That sound of wings, of birds?

729
01:28:40,759 --> 01:28:41,920
Day.

730
01:28:44,469 --> 01:28:46,068
Sunrise, here.

731
01:28:46,753 --> 01:28:49,547
There... and beyond.

732
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:54,939
The air smells of mud.
And leprosy.

733
01:28:55,542 --> 01:28:57,022
And fire.

734
01:28:58,295 --> 01:29:01,156
- Not a breath of air?
- No.

735
01:29:02,459 --> 01:29:04,427
Only very small movements...

736
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:07,484
very slow wafts...

737
01:29:08,489 --> 01:29:10,006
of odour.

738
01:29:26,139 --> 01:29:27,691
The sun.

739
01:29:28,627 --> 01:29:31,788
What light!
Awful!

740
01:29:33,561 --> 01:29:36,373
Yes.
Exile.

741
01:29:38,564 --> 01:29:40,421
She's listless.

742
01:29:41,267 --> 01:29:44,846
Yes.
Deeply absent.

743
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:52,307
The heat is rust-coloured.

744
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:55,731
Above, smoke.

745
01:29:55,936 --> 01:29:57,312
The factories.

746
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:09,135
This continent, suspended?

747
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:13,046
The monsoon.
Below, Bengal.

748
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:16,064
Further.

749
01:30:16,382 --> 01:30:17,839
Lower.

750
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:19,905
Beneath the sky.

751
01:30:20,526 --> 01:30:21,817
Look...

752
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:26,208
In a bend of the Ganges.

753
01:30:26,828 --> 01:30:28,448
That whiteness.

754
01:30:29,305 --> 01:30:30,689
Over there.

755
01:30:32,446 --> 01:30:34,022
The English cemetery.

756
01:30:48,198 --> 01:30:50,658
A car is speeding along
the straight roads,

757
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,927
by the Ganges.

758
01:30:53,276 --> 01:30:55,293
They've left for the islands.

759
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:08,609
- Those junks?
- Rice.

760
01:31:09,022 --> 01:31:12,070
On the slopes,
those dark patches?

761
01:31:12,398 --> 01:31:13,634
People.

762
01:31:13,834 --> 01:31:16,130
The highest density in the world.

763
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:28,274
- Those dark mirrors, thousands of them?
- The rice fields of India.

764
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:40,914
The black Lancia has stopped.

765
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:43,396
The rain.

766
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,044
The roads are flooded.

767
01:31:46,484 --> 01:31:48,899
They took shelter in a sala.

768
01:31:50,002 --> 01:31:51,899
There, the young attaché said:

769
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:54,547
"I saw the Vice-Consul
before I left".

770
01:31:54,872 --> 01:31:58,630
He was still shouting in the streets.
He asked if I was going to the islands.

771
01:31:58,961 --> 01:32:02,487
I said I was going to Nepal
with the Ambassador.

772
01:32:04,604 --> 01:32:07,200
Did she approve of the lie?

773
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,991
She hardly ever mentioned
the man from Lahore.

774
01:32:32,226 --> 01:32:34,148
That green colour.

775
01:32:35,208 --> 01:32:36,591
It's growing larger.

776
01:32:36,863 --> 01:32:38,258
The ocean.

777
01:32:45,854 --> 01:32:47,306
The islands.

778
01:32:48,391 --> 01:32:49,882
Which one is it?

779
01:32:50,682 --> 01:32:52,242
The largest.

780
01:32:52,695 --> 01:32:54,114
The central island.

781
01:32:55,262 --> 01:32:57,027
They've arrived.

782
01:32:58,768 --> 01:33:00,915
That white palace?

783
01:33:01,361 --> 01:33:03,158
The Prince of Wales,

784
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,399
an international hotel.

785
01:33:14,615 --> 01:33:17,731
The sea is rough.
There's been a storm.

786
01:33:23,008 --> 01:33:26,155
In front, the piers.

787
01:33:26,737 --> 01:33:29,533
Those ships sail
the South Pacific.

788
01:33:30,234 --> 01:33:32,893
Behind, berths for yachts.

789
01:33:33,915 --> 01:33:37,095
Through the trees,
the same flat horizon.

790
01:33:37,762 --> 01:33:39,815
The islands are alluvial.

791
01:33:40,627 --> 01:33:42,169
The mud of the Ganges.

792
01:33:44,722 --> 01:33:46,882
Where's the French Embassy villa?

793
01:33:47,248 --> 01:33:50,809
Beyond the hotel,
facing the ocean.

794
01:33:53,574 --> 01:33:55,780
She wanted to swim
when she arrived?

795
01:33:56,329 --> 01:33:57,637
Yes.

796
01:33:58,315 --> 01:34:00,480
It was late, The sea rough.

797
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:03,129
It was impossible to swim,

798
01:34:03,517 --> 01:34:06,578
Just let the warm waves
break over her.

799
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:08,874
She bathed with him.

800
01:34:10,638 --> 01:34:13,029
Those nets everywhere in the sea?

801
01:34:14,203 --> 01:34:16,087
Against the delta sharks.

802
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:29,710
Where is she?

803
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,823
She'll come.

804
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,263
She's coming.

805
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:42,341
- That evening, was she the same?
- Smiling.

806
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:45,038
Dressed in white.

807
01:35:04,784 --> 01:35:06,572
Who comes to the hotel?

808
01:35:07,488 --> 01:35:09,244
White India.

809
01:35:24,876 --> 01:35:26,764
I can't quite remember.

810
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,127
Didn't she go to the
Embassy villa?

811
01:35:31,065 --> 01:35:32,824
She only slept there.

812
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:36,639
She dined at the Prince of Wales,
when she went to the islands.

813
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,696
She had the villa's servants

814
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:43,912
sent back to Calcutta.

815
01:35:45,459 --> 01:35:48,969
- How long ago?
- A few weeks.

816
01:36:22,357 --> 01:36:25,137
- India Song.
- Yes.

817
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:55,112
- There's dancing in the lounge.
- Tourists from Ceylon.

818
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:00,984
These birds?

819
01:37:02,004 --> 01:37:04,482
Prisoners of the island,
because of the storm.

820
01:37:05,578 --> 01:37:07,198
They're in the mango trees.

821
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:09,287
They strip them.

822
01:37:10,206 --> 01:37:11,971
They'll fly at dawn.

823
01:37:20,789 --> 01:37:23,734
This sudden smell of death?

824
01:37:24,357 --> 01:37:25,861
Incense.

825
01:37:49,385 --> 01:37:51,754
He had come on the last boat?

826
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:55,388
Yes, the 7 o'clock boat.

827
01:37:57,948 --> 01:38:00,124
He hadn't been home all day.

828
01:38:01,336 --> 01:38:03,213
He never went back to Calcutta.

829
01:38:52,454 --> 01:38:55,770
When the mist came,
the wind dropped.

830
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:07,826
She had the blinds raised.

831
01:39:14,179 --> 01:39:17,431
She wants to see
the ocean, the sky

832
01:39:17,829 --> 01:39:19,600
above the estuaries.

833
01:39:21,317 --> 01:39:24,719
They are very tired,
after last night.

834
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:28,485
She is looking outside.

835
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:32,381
I remember...

836
01:39:32,936 --> 01:39:35,574
a wall of mist comes in
toward the islands.

837
01:39:35,847 --> 01:39:36,972
Yes.

838
01:39:38,164 --> 01:39:40,601
She says something about Venice.

839
01:39:42,285 --> 01:39:44,417
Venice in the winter.

840
01:39:45,106 --> 01:39:46,583
Yes, that's right.

841
01:39:47,808 --> 01:39:50,301
- Venice?
- Yes.

842
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:54,023
Perhaps certain winter evenings,

843
01:39:54,732 --> 01:39:57,889
in Venice, the same mist.

844
01:39:59,777 --> 01:40:03,277
She's saying the name of a colour.

845
01:40:03,774 --> 01:40:05,207
Violet.

846
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,140
The colour of the delta mist.

847
01:40:24,783 --> 01:40:27,157
It was a September evening...

848
01:40:29,025 --> 01:40:31,169
during the summer monsoon...

849
01:40:34,814 --> 01:40:36,414
on the islands...

850
01:40:41,067 --> 01:40:43,247
in 1937.

851
01:40:48,934 --> 01:40:52,851
In China, the war went on.

852
01:40:54,174 --> 01:40:56,291
Shanghai had just been bombed.

853
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:59,653
The Japanese were still advancing.

854
01:41:01,745 --> 01:41:04,458
In Spain,

855
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:06,808
they were still fighting.

856
01:41:08,211 --> 01:41:10,096
The Republic is strangled.

857
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:15,529
In Russia,
the Revolution is betrayed.

858
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:22,097
The Congress of Nuremberg
had just taken place.

859
01:41:25,178 --> 01:41:29,758
Already, the beggar woman was hunting
in the warm waters of the delta.

860
01:42:06,281 --> 01:42:09,712
Michael Richardson and
the young guest

861
01:42:09,953 --> 01:42:11,524
had gone across
the beach to the villa.

862
01:42:18,023 --> 01:42:20,548
The other two had gone sailing.

863
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:34,179
She had wanted to go back alone,

864
01:42:35,328 --> 01:42:37,124
along the inland paths.

865
01:42:40,957 --> 01:42:44,239
Behind her,
the Vice-Consul of Lahore.

866
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,328
He followed her to the park.

867
01:42:58,911 --> 01:43:03,475
Michael Richardson and the young guest
had arrived after her.

868
01:43:11,415 --> 01:43:14,028
She had gone to meet them
in the park.

869
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,572
They move toward one another.

870
01:43:20,017 --> 01:43:21,813
They meet.

871
01:43:26,889 --> 01:43:28,932
They seem to be talking.

872
01:43:32,993 --> 01:43:35,038
They go toward the villa.

873
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:13,580
Once they had tried...

874
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,358
tried to die together.

875
01:44:18,553 --> 01:44:20,358
Without succeeding.

876
01:44:21,786 --> 01:44:23,420
In a brothel,

877
01:44:24,249 --> 01:44:25,750
in Chandernagore.

878
01:44:27,187 --> 01:44:28,766
They'd been discovered.

879
01:44:50,275 --> 01:44:54,214
At one point in the night,
she brings them champagne.

880
01:44:55,714 --> 01:44:57,199
Glasses.

881
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:59,263
She serves them.

882
01:45:37,124 --> 01:45:38,621
It's still night

883
01:45:39,345 --> 01:45:42,242
when Michael Richardson
takes away the young guest.

884
01:45:43,078 --> 01:45:45,036
Tears himself away from that place.

885
01:45:46,051 --> 01:45:47,726
Leaves her there.

886
01:46:16,715 --> 01:46:18,104
Later,

887
01:46:18,404 --> 01:46:22,267
music was heard
around the Embassy villa.

888
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:42,791
The lovers of the Ganges had promised
to let each other be free,

889
01:47:43,126 --> 01:47:47,899
if ever either of them
decided to die.

890
01:50:04,962 --> 01:50:08,994
The young guest came back
to the villa during the night.

891
01:50:10,095 --> 01:50:13,459
Yes.
He saw her.

892
01:50:14,832 --> 01:50:16,797
She was lying in the park,

893
01:50:17,379 --> 01:50:19,565
leaning on one elbow.
He said:

894
01:50:20,098 --> 01:50:24,134
"She stretched out her arm
and put her head on it."

895
01:50:27,942 --> 01:50:30,781
"The Vice-Consul of Lahore
was ten yards away."

896
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,622
They didn't speak to each other."

897
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:38,865
She must have stayed there
a long time. Till daylight.

898
01:50:40,077 --> 01:50:42,169
Then she must have taken the path.

899
01:50:46,364 --> 01:50:49,188
On the beach
they found the dressing gown.

900
01:50:55,863 --> 01:50:58,746
And the heat was once more
the heat of Calcutta.
