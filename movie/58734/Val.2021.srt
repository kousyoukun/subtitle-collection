00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,300
我走向哈罗德·贝克，对他说

2
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,300
MAN: So I went over to Harold Becker and I said,

3
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,360
“听着，老兄，我是不会退出的

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,360
"Listen, man, I’m not quitting.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,460
你不可能让我走人，你个混蛋。”

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,460
You can’t get me to quit, you fucker."

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,720
最后一幕里，我会狠狠教训他一顿

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,720
I’ll kick that guy’s ass in the last scene.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,170
你懂吧？

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,170
You know?

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,670
于是第二天，他们说：“不行，你不许离开”

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,670
So the next day, they said, "No, you got to go."

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,260
你以前被解雇过吗？

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,260
You ever been fired before?

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,800

20

VAL: I’ve almost been fired from all of my movies.

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,100
每一次都是，剧组都已经开始找别的演员了

22

I’ve wanted to tell a story about acting

153
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,730
并已这样想了很久

154
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,730
for a very long time.

155
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,310
讲述在某个时间点，「你」开始消失

156
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,310
About the place where you end

157
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,780
而你的角色开始存在

158
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,780
and the character begins.

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,910
讲述真实与虚幻

160
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,910
About truth and illusion.

161
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,450
现如今，说话变为一件很难的事

162
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,450
Now that it’s more difficult to speak,

163
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,290
我比以往任何时候，都更想讲述我的故事

164
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,290
I want to tell my story more than ever.

165
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,880

167
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,550
却又与我的一生毫无干系

168
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,550
that is also not my life.

169
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,020
感觉就像我活过我的人生

170
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,020
It’s like I’ve lived my life

171
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,940
同时

172
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,940
and

173
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,320
一切又像是

174
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,320
it’s sort of

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,200

all in these boxes,

177
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,820
但是，那深刻的悲伤中时常有一部分提醒着我

178
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,820
but what is part of the profound sadness is that

179
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,580
我清楚，我的人生是不完整的

180
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,580
I know it’s incomplete.

181
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,630

filmed and as hard as I’ve tried,

185
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,510
依旧无济于事

186
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,510
there’s nothing I can do

187
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,270
to make any of it understood.

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,270
无法揭示其中任何一部分的含义

189
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,680

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,680
I know that

191
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,900
这种感觉并非真实

192
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,900
that’s not true,

193
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,980
但这的确是我所感受到的

194
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,980

Hey, there, you come to see the boating accident?

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
这场船难不是意外

214
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
This was no boating accident.

215
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,060
我知道你想让这条鱼死球

216
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,060
I know you want this fish dead.

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,320
我会找到他，杀掉他

找到他，三个数；杀了他，十个数

Ten boxes of crackers.

227
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,880
很久很久以前，曾经有三兄弟：

228
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,880
JACK: Once upon a time, there were three brothers:

229
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,840
卫斯理

230
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,840
Wesley,

231
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,260
马克

232
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,260
Mark

233
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,130
和我，方

234
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,130
and me, Val.

235
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,840
我们的父亲，尤金，是一个工业家

236
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,840
Our father Eugene was an industrialist

237
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,430
也是一名房地产开发商

238
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,430
and real estate developer.

239
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,659
他的公司名为自由工程

240
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,640
He named his company Liberty Engineering

241
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,270
这个名字取自美国最伟大的巨型雕像

242
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,270
after the greatest large sculpture in America.

243
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,150
我们的母亲，格莱迪斯，是一位属灵的女人

244
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,150
Our mother Gladys was a spiritual woman

245
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,610
她很喜欢马儿

246
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,610
who loved horses.

247
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,190
正是他们共享的、对基督科学教的虔诚

248
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,190
It was their shared devotion to Christian Science

249
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,150
让我们的父母走到一起

250
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,150
that brought my parents together.

251
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
我们在加利福尼亚州的查茨沃斯长大

252
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
They raised us in Chatsworth, California,

253
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,370
在圣费尔南多山谷的深处

254
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,370
deep in the San Fernando Valley,

255
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,210
毗邻好莱坞——世界电影之都

256
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,210
adjacent to Hollywood, the movie capital of the world.

257
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,550
我的弟弟，卫斯理，是一个满怀抱负的导演

258
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,550
My younger brother Wesley was an aspiring director,

259
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,170
一个艺术天才；他的想象力让我的黯然失色

260
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,170
an artistic genius whose imagination dwarfed mine.

261
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,539
大部分时间里，他都在创作艺术

262
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,539
He spent most of his time making art...

263
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,039
以及重拍他最喜欢的电影

264
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,059
and remaking the films he loved most.

265
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
我们住在罗杰·罗伊斯农场的对面

266
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
We lived down the street from Roy Rogers’ ranch,

267
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,480
当那座农场于1971年被出售时

268
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,480
and when it went up for sale in 1971,

269
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,150
my father bought it and moved us in.

270
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,150
我的父亲买下它，我们搬了进去

271
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,950
卫斯理把农场变成一个完备的电影拍摄现场

272
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,000
Wesley turned the ranch into a full-on movie set.

273
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,610
哈哈！按下按钮

274
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,610
Ha-ha! Push the button. (cackles)

275
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,250
我打算用这枚火箭覆盖实测的一英里范围

276
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,250
With this rocket, I intend to cover the measured mile

277
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,740
预计用时约12秒

278
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,740
in approximately 12 seconds.

279
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,040
激活火箭

280
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,040
Activate the rocket.

281
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,410
很早的时候，我就想演戏了

282
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,430
JACK: I wanted to act early on.

283
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,750

JACK: My heroes were the greats... -Yeah?

289
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,470
他们在舞台上受训，由此起航

290
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,470
who trained on the stage and went on

291
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,760
点亮一块块荧幕

292
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,760

295
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,140
我还记得，我第一次让一批真正意义上的观众大笑

296
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,140
JACK: I remember the first time I made a real audience laugh.

297
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,700
- 别吵醒炸弹！   -（观众大笑）

298
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,670
- Don’t wake the bomb. - (audience laughing)

299
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,980
就是在那时，在那个地方，我意识到

300
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,980
JACK: It was then and there that I realized

301
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,980
-没有比这更好的事了  -这个小炸弹

302
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,980
- there was nothing better. - That small bomb,

303
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,860
要是爆炸了，会把整个纽约炸上天'

304
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,860
if it explodes, will blow up all of New York.

305
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,530
还有费城和波士顿

306
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,530
Also, Philadelphia and Boston.

307
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,030
就是这样

308
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,030
JACK: And that was that.

309
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,700
重复我说的话：

310
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,700

319
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,750
This is the first time for Chatsworth.

320
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,750
对查茨沃斯来说，这是第一次

321
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,050
山谷独幕戏剧节，山谷学院

322
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,260
如果你对某件事有足够的信念

323
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,260
JACK: If you believe in something enough,

324
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,470
那件事便会成真

325
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,470
it becomes real.

326
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,390
After years of dreaming about going to New York,

327
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,390
那么多年里，我一直梦想前往纽约

328
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,560
I was the youngest kid ever accepted

329
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,560
终于，我成为茱莉亚学院戏剧学院

330
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,900
有史以来最年轻的新生

331
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,900
into drama school at Juilliard.

332
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,070
基默先生，当你...当你听到人们说

333
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,070
WOMAN: Mr. Kilmer, just... just what did you feel

334
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,120
[查茨沃斯的传说]是第一名的时候

335
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,140
at the time when they said

336
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,900
你是什么心情？

337
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,900
Tales from Chatsworth is the play?

338
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,360
我只感到一股麻木的感觉

339
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,360
VAL: All I felt was this numbing sensation

340
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,530
在我的左耳边大喊：我们赢了！

341
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,530
in my left ear saying, "We won!"

342
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,750
在我前往纽约上学以前

343
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,750
JACK: I was about to start school in New York

344
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,180
我做了一个梦

345
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,180
when I had a dream.

346
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
梦里，我正在与我高中女友梅尔和她妈妈讲话

347
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
In it, I was talking to my high school girlfriend Mare

348
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,560
我们一同讨论死亡

349
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,560
and her mom about death.

350
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,750
她妈妈说，死亡不是她所畏惧的

351
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,750
Her mom said it wasn’t something she feared

352
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,640
因为死亡是她与造物主相见的时刻

353
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,640
because it was where she would meet her creator.

354
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,610
电话铃声把我吵醒

355
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,610
I woke from that dream to a phone call

356
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,070
是我的哥哥马克打电话来告诉我：

357
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,070
from my older brother Mark telling me that Wesley

358
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,650
卫斯理癫痫发作，淹死在家中的按摩浴缸里

359
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,700
had an epileptic fit and drowned in our Jacuzzi.

360
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,710
那一年，他十五岁

361
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,710
He was 15.

362
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,000
(train passing)

363
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,170
天空为之哭泣

364
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,170
The sky wept.

365
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,050
不再有自摄影片

366
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,050
No more home videos.

367
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,720
不再有就地取材的演出

368
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,720
No more makeshift plays.

369
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,730
我的知己消失在尘土之中

370
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,730
My confidant had disappeared into dust.

371
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,820
自此，我们的家与从前再不相同

372
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,820
And our family was never the same again.

373
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,170
纽约

374
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,450
你好

375
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,500
Hi.

376
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,170
我和戏剧学院的主管有一场预约

377
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,170
I’m meeting the director of the drama division

378
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,300
带我儿子在学校里转转

379
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,300
to show my son the school.

380
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,810
当我终于开始上学的时候

381
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,810
JACK: When I finally started school,

382
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,850
我的心因悲痛而伤痕累累

383
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,850
I was raw with grief.

384
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,150
我在公寓贴满卫斯理的画，以此帮助自己

385
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,150
I put Wesley’s drawings up all over my apartment to help me.

386
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,040
茱莉亚是个艰苦的地方

387
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,040
Juilliard was tough.

388
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,340
课程非常严格，并且第一天我们就学到

389
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,340
The courses were rigorous, and it was made clear to us

390
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,290
我们以为自己知道的一切都是错误的

391
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,290
on the first day, whatever we thought we knew was wrong.

392
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,710
詹姆斯·利普顿：你是什么时候写下那本

393
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,710
JAMES LIPTON: When did you write a volume of poetry

394
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,140
名为《大火过后，我的伊甸》的诗集？

395
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,140
called My Edens After Burns?

396
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,330
87，88年

397
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,330
’87, ’88.

398
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,800
詹姆斯·利普顿 1926 - 2020

399
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,810
里面有一首诗名为《表演课程》

400
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,810
There’s a poem in here called "Acting Class."

401
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,320
方："这些演戏的场景如死亡的便士

402
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,320
VAL: "These acting scenes are death pennies

403
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,320
death pennies:放在尸体头上的便士，意为\N前往另一个世界的买路钱

404
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,650
"悬挂在我的头上

405
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,650
- "hanging over my head. - (laughter)

406
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,790
"但我们皆为朋友，坐在撒旦设计的座位上

407
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,790
"But we’re all friends here, sitting in chairs designed by Satan...

408
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,490
"距离这个说教者有千万英里之远

409
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,490
"a million miles away from this pontificator

410
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,280
畅饮表演那永恒不灭的甘泉"

411
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,280
juicing over the eternal springs of moment-to-moment acting."

412
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,530
-她对我们特别严格。  -她是吗？

413
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,530
- She was so hard on us. - She was hard?

414
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,210
我们学习了一切：欧里庇得斯

415
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,210
JACK: We were schooled in everything: Euripides,

416
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,800
契诃夫，还有，当然了，莎士比亚

417
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,800
Chekov, and Shakespeare, of course.

418
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,260
你在这儿呢，方

419
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,260
WOMAN: There you go, Val.

420
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,970
这是你的名字

421
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,970
- Here’s your name. - (laughter)

422
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,090
就在这底下...

423
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,090
Right under...

424
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,020
-你知道这是谁吗？  -杰克：不知道，不

425
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,020
- Do you know who that is? - JACK: I do not, no.

426
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,930
这是一位出名的女演员

427
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,930
That’s a famous actress,

428
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,060
凯莉·麦吉利斯

429
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,060
Kelly McGillis.

430
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,580
-女人：这看起来熟悉吗？  方：当然了

431
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,580
- WOMAN: Does this look familiar? - VAL: It sure does.

432
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,400
杰克：这好酷

433
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,400
- (laughs) - JACK: This is cool.

434
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,780
当时，没有剧本创作的项目

435
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,780
JACK: There was no playwriting program at the time,

436
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,600
非常奇怪，所以我们创办了一个

437
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,600
which was odd, so we started one.

438
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,490
我们写了一个剧本，名叫[一切如何开始]

439
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,490
We wrote a play called How It All Began,

440
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,370
它是基于迈克尔·鲍曼的回忆录创作的

441
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,370
based on the memoir of Michael Baumann,

442
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,450
鲍曼是一个德国的前左派激进分子

443
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,450
a former leftist German militant.

444
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,960
那么，现在

445
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,960
WOMAN: Well, now,

446
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,630
迈克尔·鲍曼能够讲述他的故事

447
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,630
Michael Baumann will be able to tell his story.

448
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,670
这部戏剧和恐怖主义有关

449
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,670
JACK: The play was about terrorism,

450
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,590
至今，这个话题仍然拥有现实意义

451
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,590
a topic as relevant as ever today.

452
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,880
在反叛哈什中央游击委员会

453
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,880
Before the Central Committee of the Roaming Hash Rebels

454
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,640
或者别的这种玩意儿存在以前，我是个绝对正常的人

455
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,640
or anything like it existed, I was a perfectly normal person.

456
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,370
然后我从中摄取到一种感觉

457
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,370
And then I got this feeling from it that’s like,

458
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,390
就像是滚石乐队，就像...你懂吗

459
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,390
just like the Rolling Stones, like, you know,

460
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,890
是个城里人！

461
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,890
it’s a downtowner!

462
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,310
我们将一个梦变成现实

463
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,310
JACK: We dreamed that play into existence

464
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,360
我体会到，在舞台上表演我自己的话语是多么快乐

465
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,360
and I experienced the joy of performing my own words onstage.

466
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
-那很..  -很抽象。  -抽象

467
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
- It’s-it’s abstract. - WOMAN: Abstract.

468
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,900
它改变了我的生活

469
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,900
JACK: It was life-changing.

470
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,410
你无法将任何一个元素单独拿出来审视

471
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,410
You can’t look at any one element in isolation

472
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,240
然后说：这是唯一正确的

473
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,240
and say this is the only thing that’s true.

474
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,310
那部戏取得了巨大的成功

475
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,310
-(applause) -JACK: The play was such a success

476
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,710
毕业后，我们被邀请去一个公共剧院表演

477
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,710
that we were invited to perform it at the public theater after graduation.

478
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,760
作为主角，我向着成为城里的年轻剧院新星

479
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,760
As the lead, it was my first step toward

480
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,060
迈出第一步

481
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,060
becoming a young theater star in the city.

482
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,110
瞧瞧我们，拍摄着我们自己

483
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,110
Here we are, filming ourselves.

484
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,950
今天是1983年四月3日

485
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,950
The date is April 3, 1983.

486
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,830
毕业两年后

487
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,830
JACK: Two years after graduation,

488
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,500
我迎来第一次重大突破：

489
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,500
I get my first big break

490
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,920
我要在纽约的舞台上演一部剧，名叫[平板男孩]

491
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,920
on the New York stage in a play called Slab Boys.

492
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,450
凯文·贝肯 \N西恩·潘

493
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
但是，在被选为男主角后

494
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
But after being given the lead,

495
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,840
导演问我，我是否介意扮演第二主角

496
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,840
I was asked by the director if I would mind

497
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,600
因为凯文·贝肯有时间参演

498
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,600
playing the second lead because Kevin Bacon was available.

499
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,850
来吧，老兄

500
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,850
Come on, man.

501
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,730
那是，呃，那是个摄像机吗

502
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,730
Is that, uh, is that a video camera?

503
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,440
-正拍着呢   -那太酷了，方

504
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,440
- WOMAN: It’s rolling, yeah. - Oh, that’s really cool, Val.

505
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,360
那边..那是老大

506
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,360
That... that is boss.

507
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,150
这地方有电视吗？

508
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,150
Do we have a television here?

509
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,280
然后，我被安排了男三号的角色

510
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,280
JACK: Then I was asked to play the third lead

511
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,240
因为西恩·潘也有时间

512
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,240
because Sean Penn was available.

513
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,910
{\i1}今夜月光明亮{\i0}

514
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,910
BOTH: ♪ There’s a moon out tonight ♪

515
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,290
{\i1}我为之倾倒{\i0}

516
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,290
♪ That I adore. ♪

517
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,670
这一幕要值点钱的

518
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,670
That’s gonna be worth some money.

519
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,670
现在我想请你做的是，当我离开的时候

520
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,670
Now, what I’d like you to do is when I leave,

521
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,970
我想让你越近越好

522
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,970
I want you to get as close as you can.

523
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,430
只留几英寸的距离

524
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,430
You only have a couple of feet.

525
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,600
放大镜头，去拍那个盒子

526
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,600
And zoom in on the box.

527
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,930
然后你会听见我在舞台上说：「我想要茶，谢谢」

528
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,930
And then you’ll hear me say, "I’ll take a tea, please,"

529
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,410
而马克和雪莉，我的兄弟和...

530
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,410
onstage, while Mark and Cheryl, my brother and...

531
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,860
你知道你是谁...他们会看着的

532
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,860
you know who you are... well, they’ll be watching it.

533
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,440
拜拜

534
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,440
- Bye.

535
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,440
要上台了

536
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,440
- About to go onstage.

537
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,530
方要盛大出场了

538
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,530
MAN: Val’s just about to make his entrance.

539
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,110
-杰克。  -嗨，阿奇

540
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,110
- Jack. - Hi, Archie.

541
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
-这位是菲尔·麦康。  -你咋样，阿奇

542
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
- And this is Phil McCann. - Howdy, Andy.

543
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
最后，另一位大人物是'

544
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
And last but by all means least...

545
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,160
赫克特·麦肯锡

546
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,160
Hector McKenzie...

547
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,620
我从这出戏剧的大明星

548
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,620
JACK: I went from being the star of the play

549
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,880
变成了每个笑话里的陪衬

550
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,880
to playing the character that was the butt of every joke.

551
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,590
这不是一件容易接受的事，但我做到了

552
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,590
It wasn’t an easy pill to swallow, but I did it.

553
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,980
的确是这样的：没有微不足道的角色

554
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,980
JACK: It’s true that there are no small parts,

555
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,560
只有微不足道的演员

556
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,560
only small actors.

557
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,390
而同样真实的是：不是所有角色都是平等的

558
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,390
It’s also true that not all characters are created equal,

559
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,680
我明白了，我的任务应该是

560
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,680
and it became clear to me that my mission should be

561
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,560
去争取那些能够改变我的角色

562
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,560
to chase down those roles that would transform me.

563
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,450
纽约 \N我的公寓

564
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,540
我非常坚定地想出演[哈姆雷特]...

565
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,540
I’m really determined to do Hamlet...

566
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,170
在大概27岁的时候，也可能28岁

567
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,170
by about 27, maybe 28.

568
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
我真的很想

569
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
I really am.

570
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,800
我会非常努力，全身心地投入

571
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,800
I’m gonna work on it very hard and be very dedicated to it,

572
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,050
像一个周末夏令营的辅导员一样拼

573
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,050
just like a weekend camp counselor.

574
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,470
在[哈姆雷特]中，莎士比亚提出

575
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,470
JACK: In Hamlet, Shakespeare suggests it’s the actor’s job

576
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,980
演员的工作就是为本性举起一面镜子

577
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,980
to hold a mirror up to nature.

578
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,820
从一场幻梦中捕捉永恒的真理

579
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,820
To capture everlasting truth through an illusion.

580
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,010
作为演员，我们应当努力的目标是

581
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,010
What we strive for as actors is

582
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,160
我们的演出是那样真实，以至于观众从中看到自己

583
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,160
a performance so true that the audience can see themselves in it.

584
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,910
好的，坏的，抑或丑陋的

585
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,910
Good, bad or ugly.

586
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,220
啊，但愿这一太过坚实的肉体会融解

587
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,220
Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt,

588
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,760
消散...

589
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,760
thaw...

590
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,890
化作一滩露水！

591
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,890
and resolve itself into a dew.

592
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,230
哦...

593
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,230
Oh...

594
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,740
但愿这一太过坚实的肉体会融解

595
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,740
that this too, too solid flesh would melt,

596
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,530
消散...

597
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,530
thaw...

598
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,290
化作一滩露水！

599
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,290
and resolve itself into a dew.

600
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,290
哦...

601
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,290
Oh...

602
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,260
但愿这一太过坚实的肉体会融解

603
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,290
that this too, too solid flesh would melt,

604
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,340
消散并化作一滩露水

605
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,340
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

606
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,180
愿这...

607
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,180
That this...

608
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,510
太过坚实的肉体会融解

609
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,510
too, too solid flesh would melt,

610
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,350
消散并化作一滩露水

611
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,350
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

612
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,020
真希望永恒真神没有定下

613
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,020
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed

614
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,520
禁止自杀的戒律

615
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,520

616
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,820
哦，上帝

617
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,820
Oh, God.

618
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,110
上帝！

619
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,110
God!

620
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,780
你的身体正在，呃

621
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,780
Your body was literally, uh, um,

622
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,450
彼得·凯斯\N导演/制作人 \N表演课教练

623
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,700
对正在发生的事情做出反应

624
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,700
responding to what was happening.

625
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,700
困惑和动乱出现在....

626
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,700
Turmoil was going on inside...

627
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,580
你的脑子里

628
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,580
your head this time.

629
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,880
为什么选择这样极端的表演方式？

630
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,880
Um... why such an extreme response?

631
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,500
呃，那些话，就是他说

632
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,500
Uh, these words, when he says that,

633
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,590
"我不想继续活着，我希望我已经死去"

634
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,590
"I don’t want to live anymore, I wish I was dead,"

635
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,510
我从没——我从没有过这样的想法，真的

636
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,510
I’ve-I’ve never thought those thoughts, really.

637
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,890
我从没...我觉得他是认真的

638
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,890
I’ve never... and I took them to be true.

639
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,350
不仅仅是一种...

640
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,350
It’s not just like a...

641
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,070
"干，我希望我死了！"，也不是"我希望..."

642
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,070
"Fuck, I wish I was dead." Or, "I wish..."

643
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,810
凯斯：不可能，绝对不可能

644
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,810
KASS: There is no way, absolutely no way

645
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,690
你不可能没有过这样的念头

646
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,690
you never thought those thoughts.

647
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,650
绝对不可能

648
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,650
There is no way.

649
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,530
每个演员都必须接受这一点

650
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,530
Every actor must finally accept that.

651
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,280
好吧，但是在那种语境下...

652
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,280
Well, yeah, in the context of what...

653
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,950
在那时的环境里，当角色表达...

654
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,950
of the situation where the character expresses...

655
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,120
是的，因此你有过这些想法

656
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,120
Yes, so you had those thoughts

657
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,580
哪怕是角色在想

658
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,580
even as this character expresses.

659
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,200
是的，你有过这些经历

660
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,200
Yes, you’ve had these experiences.

661
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,790
是的，你有过这样的反应

662
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,790
Yes, you have had this response.

663
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,210
对演员的能力而言

664
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,210
There are no limitations

665
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,960
对演员的创造力...不存在边界这一概念

666
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,960
to the actor’s capacity... the creative capacity...

667
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,460
演员必须去体会那不曾发生过的事

668
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,460
to have experienced even that which is not

669
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,600
让它们成为你生命中有意识的经历

670
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,600
a conscious experience in your life,

671
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,600
也正是因此，我坚定地相信

672
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,600
and it’s for this reason that I have held firmly to the belief

673
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,350
任何情况下都没有"替代"的必要

674
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,350
that there never is a need for substitution.

675
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,140
说什么，"我从没有过这样的体验"

676
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,140
Because, "I never had this situation in my life.

677
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,980
"我从没经历过这个"

678
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,980
I never experienced this."

679
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,870
世界上没有任何一件事

680
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,900
There is nothing

681
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,940
是你不曾经历、不曾知晓的

682
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,940

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,280
成为法国地下反抗军的首领

716
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,280
to be the leader of the French Underground.

717
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,610
我知道，这些..

718
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,610
I know. It...

719
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,950
这一切听起来像一部很差劲的电影

720
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,950
It all sounds like some bad movie.

721
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,750
我以我知道的唯一方式理解这个角色

722
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,750
JACK: I approached the character the only way I knew how,

723
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,710
即，使用我拥有的一切

724
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,710
which was with everything I had.

725
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,500
{\i1}你能有多愚蠢？{\i0}

♪ How silly can you get, yeah, yeah... ♪

727
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,130
我花了四个月的时间学习怎么弹吉他

728
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,130
I spent four months learning how to play the guitar,

729
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,630
但是，等我到了拍摄现场

730
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,630
but when I got to set,

731
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,540
导演们觉得要是我假装弹吉他会更好玩

732
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,540
the directors thought it would be funnier if I mimed.

733
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,760
当我把指头练出血的时候，他们就在旁边看着

734
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,760
They watched me make my fingers bleed

735
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,600
只为了在以后某个瞬间看我脸上的表情

736
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,600
just to see the look on my face

737
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,280
就是当他们告诉我："要是你根本不会弹吉他

738
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,280
when they told me, "We like it better when you

739
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,610
就像猫王那样，我们觉得会更好"的刹那

740
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,610
can’t play, like Elvis."

741
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,570
我们在伦敦拍摄这部电影

742
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,570
We filmed the movie in London,

743
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,480
但这是我进入好莱坞的开端

744
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,480
but it was my initiation into Hollywood.

745
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,120
伦敦

746
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,620
方：我太想念伦敦了

747
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,620
VAL: I miss London bad.

748
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,910
因为，就是，

749
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,910
It’s just, you know,

750
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,290
这是我去过的第一个大城市

751
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,290
the first big city I came to

752
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,370
在纽约以后

753
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,370
after New York.

754
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,550
在伦敦拍摄时，我住的公寓

755
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,550
JACK: While I was filming, I stayed in an apartment

756
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,180
和著名的皇家宫廷剧院在一条街上

757
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,180
just down the street from the famous Royal Court Theatre.

758
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,220
一些了不起的演员，像是劳伦斯·奥利弗

759
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,220
Great actors like Laurence Olivier

760
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,890
和亚历克·基尼斯曾亲临这个舞台

761
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,890
and Alec Guinness have graced that stage.

762
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,190
在那时，尚未出名的丹尼·博伊尔

763
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,190
At the time, an unknown Danny Boyle

764
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,810
导演了一部名叫[天才]的戏剧

765
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,810
was directing a play there called The Genius,

766
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,480
我渴望得到文化和灵感的浸染，于是去了

767
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,480
and I went eager for some culture and inspiration.

768
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,150
我立刻对这部剧里

769
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,150
I immediately fell in love

770
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,240
一位名叫琼妮·威利的年轻演员一见钟情

771
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,240
with a young actress in it named Joanne Whalley.

772
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,990
我看她的次数已经超出我愿意承认的范围

773
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,990
I watched her in that play more times than I’d like to admit.

774
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,300
一天晚上，我跟着她和她的同事们来到当地的酒吧

775
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,300
And one night, I followed her and her cast mates to a local pub,

776
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,940
但是我太害羞，还被吓坏了，根本不敢自我介绍

777
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,940
but I was too intimidated and shy to introduce myself.

778
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,670
她光芒四射

779
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,670
She was brilliant.

780
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,750

782
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,550

783

JACK: And I was in town making fluff.

欢迎登舰，演员们

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,240
Welcome aboard, actors.

789
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,100
就位了。轨道已升起

790
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,100

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,580
And follow me.

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,580
("Films" by Gary Numan playing)

797
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,120
不管你信不信

798
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,120
JACK: Believe it or not,

799
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,870
一开始，我不想参演[壮志凌云]

800
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,870
I didn’t want to do Top Gun at first.

801
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,080
我觉得剧本很傻

802
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,080
I felt the script was silly,

803
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,670
也不喜欢电影呈现的好战性

804
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,670
and disliked warmongering in film.

805
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,630
但是我和制作室有合同

806
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,630
But I was under contract with the studio,

807
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,760
所以我没得选择

808
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,760
so I didn’t really have a choice.

809
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,700
是导演托尼·斯科特丰富多彩的愿景以及能量

810
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,700
It was the director Tony Scott’s colorful vision and energy

811
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,860
才让这段旅程变得愉快

812
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,860
that made the whole experience enjoyable.

813
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,600
很难不为之倾倒

814
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,600
It was hard not to be seduced by it.

815
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,070
剧本并没有对"冰人"这一角色着墨很多

816
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,070
On the page, there was very little to the character Iceman.

817
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,290
{\i1}我不喜欢这部电影，我不喜欢这部电影{\i0}

我给他创作了一个背景故事

824
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
I manifested a backstory for him

825
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,380
他有一位忽视他的父亲

826
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,380
where he had a father who ignored him,

827
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,970
因此，他被一种渴求推动

828
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,970
and as a result, was driven by the need

829
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,970
需要在各方面都变得完美

830
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,970
to be perfect in every way.

831
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,840

833
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,430
这种对完美的迷恋使他变得傲慢、自大

834
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,430
This obsession with perfection is what made him so arrogant.

835
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,610
很好，那一下很棒

836
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,610
That was great. That was a good shot.

837
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,340
我故意将我和汤姆克鲁斯的宿敌关系

838
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,340
JACK: I would purposely play up the rivalry

839
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,910
拓展到了屏幕之外

840
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,910
between Tom’s character and mine off-screen as well.

841
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,890
最后的结果是，演员们以一种方法派的风格

842
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,890
And what ended up happening is the actors,

843
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,200
分成了两个截然不同的阵营

844
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,200
in true Method fashion, split into two distinct camps.

845
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,660
独行侠和呆头鹅在一边

846
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,660
You had Maverick and Goose on one side

847
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,920
滑块、好莱坞、狼人和我，冰人，在另一边

848
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,920
and Slider, Hollywood, Wolfman and me, Iceman, on the other.

849
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,450
在屏幕上渲染我们的冲突很有趣

850
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,450
It was fun to play up the conflict between our characters,

851
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,490
但是现实中，我一直把汤姆看为我的朋友

852
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,490
but in reality, I’ve always thought of Tom as a friend,

853
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,590
一直以来，我们彼此扶持

854
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,590
and we’ve always supported each other.

855
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,180

856
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,180

插入画面有时候非常宝贵

862
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,100
Inserts can be valuable.

我为此感到深深的骄傲

I’m pretty proud of it.

901

我们都处于事业的起步阶段

902

CRUISE: There’s one thing I’ve learned in all my years:

911
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,330
有时候你得说："我操啥啊？"

912
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,330
sometimes you got to say, "What the fuck?"

913

Val, it was a full-page ad yesterday.

918

Val, you have to get still approval next time.

919
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,260
要是重力倒转，你能做好准备吗？

What’s up?

982
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,100
正如你数次所见

983
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,100
So, as you have seen now several times,

984
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,560
我不堵住这个洞就没法说话

985
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,560
I can’t speak without plugging this hole.

986
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,100
这是因为

987
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,100
This is because

988
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,200
他们把一片塑料接入我的气管里

989
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,200
they put a piece of plastic down my breathing tube,

990
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,500
众所周知，这也是食物进入体内的管道

991
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,500
which is also, as everyone knows, where your food goes down,

992
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
因为这个洞太小了

993
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
and because the hole is so small,

994
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,450
当你有这种问题的时候

995
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,450
you have to make a choice,

996
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,040
你必须做出选择，是呼吸还是吃东西

997
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,040
when you have this kind of problem, whether you breathe or eat.

998
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,340
很显然，要是你不呼吸了，你也没法吃东西

999
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,340
Obviously, if you can’t breathe, you can’t eat.

1000
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,960
见鬼！

1001
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,960
Shit!

1002
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,840

1003
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,840

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,300

1005
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,300

1006
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,020
方，我还没穿好衣服呢

1007
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,020
Oh, Val, I’m not even ready, dressed.

1008
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,390
女人：她平时就特别好看了

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,390
WOMAN: She really looks great usually.

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,840

1011
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,840
- Oh... come on. - You’ll notice later.

1012
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,730
-我想拍照片

1013
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,730
- MAN: I want my picture taken. - (gasps)

1014
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,400
别...算了，方

1015
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,400

-哦..别，别，方

1017
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,240
(laughing): Oh... don’t. Don’t, Val.

1018
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,050
杰克：我八岁的时候，我妈妈申请离婚

1019
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,050
JACK: My mom filed for divorce when I was eight.

1020
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,440
我的父亲有多段外遇

1021
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,440
My father had several affairs,

1022
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,660
这使得我妈妈最终离开了他

1023
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,660
and my mother finally left him because of it.

1024
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,500
女人：（笑）她想躲起来呢

1025
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,500
WOMAN: (laughs) She’s trying to hide.

1026
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,550
我父亲是用他的权力和金钱

1027
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,550
JACK: My father used his power and money

1028
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,250
取得了我哥哥和我的监护权

1029
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,250
to win custody of my brothers and I.

1030
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,170
格莱迪斯：你可以告诉大家...

1031
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,170
GLADYS: You can tell everybody it was...

1032
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,420
（瑞典口音）我在做瑞典菜呢

1033
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,420
(Swedish accent): it was the Swedish cooking.

1034
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,560
在我成长的过程中，妈妈就像英格丽·褒曼一般充满谜团

1035
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,560
JACK: Growing up, Mom was as enigmatic to me as Ingrid Bergman

1036
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,220
后者也是瑞典人

1037
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,220
who was also Swedish.

1038
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,810
她是一个强大的女人，超脱于世界之外

1039
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,810
She was strong but aloof,

1040
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,900
这使我想更加追求她的认可和爱

1041
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,900
which made me seek out her approval and love even more.

1042
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,520
格莱迪斯：卡拉有八个孙辈

1043
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,520
GLADYS: Carla’s got eight grandkids.

1044
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,570
个个都可爱极了

1045
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,570
And they’re all darling.

1046
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,740
离婚后，她搬到了亚利桑那州的威肯勃格

1047
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,740
JACK: After the divorce, she moved to Wickenburg, Arizona,

1048
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,950
嫁给比尔——她的一生挚爱

1049
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,950
and married Bill, the love of her life.

1050
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,760
这不公平，方·基默，你个小王八蛋

1051
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,760
That’s not fair, Val Kilmer, you turkey.

1052
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,880
比尔永远是派对的主角

1053
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,880
JACK: Bill was the life of the party,

1054
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
他喜欢喝到口齿不清

1055
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
who loved to drink till he slurred

1056
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,470
然后大讲黄色笑话，引得我妈妈笑个不停

1057
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,470
and told dirty jokes that my mom loved to laugh at

1058
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,930
然后她会用教训的语气说："哦，比尔"

1059
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,930
and then would admonish with, "Oh, Bill."

1060
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,100
对，对，接住它，接住！

1061
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,100
Yeah, yeah, get it, get, get!

1062
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,470
我没有立刻接受他

1063
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,470
JACK: I didn’t take to him right off the bat.

1064
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,220
但渐渐地我意识到，他的灵魂是多么美好

1065
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,220
I eventually came to recognize what a good soul he was.

1066
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,530
（英国口音）：你吼

1067
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,530
(British accent): Hello.

1068
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,560
我觉得我得再来一瓶零度可乐

1069
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,560
I think I’ll have another Diet Coke.

1070
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,450
钢琴演奏"冬季乐园"

1071
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,450
(piano playing "Winter Wonderland")

1072
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,500
我妈妈几乎不与旁人分享她的个人感受

1073
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,500
JACK: My mother rarely shared her personal feelings,

1074
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,010
但是，通过她传递给我的信仰，我一直与她有一种联系

1075
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,010
but I always felt connected to her through the faith that she passed on to me.

1076
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,070
这信仰帮我度过人生里一些最绝望的困境

1077
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,070
That faith has helped me weather some of life’s most devastating hardships.

1078
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,500
查茨沃斯 \N加利福尼亚

1079
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,270
我从前曾经全身心恨着查茨沃斯

1080
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,270
I used to hate the Valley with an absolute passion.

1081
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,870
我就是恨这里

1082
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,870
I hate it.

1083
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,280
它太，呃..

1084
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,280
It’s so, uh...

1085
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,650
它是地狱的边缘

1086
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,650
it’s the rim of hell.

1087
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,130
它是地狱的开端，就在这里

1088
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,130
It’s where hell begins, right here.

1089
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,450
要是你从边缘看出去

1090
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,450
If you look over the edge,

1091
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,570
你能一直往下看到地狱

1092
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,570
you can look down into hell.

1093
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,670
我有十五年没来过这里了

1094
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,670
I haven’t been out here in 15 years.

1095
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,170
上次我来这儿

1096
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,170
The last time I was out here was making

1097
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,670
是和小罗伯特·唐尼一起拍摄[小贼·美女·妙探]

1098
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,670
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with Robert Downey Jr.

1099
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,140
那栋房子当时就在这儿了

1100
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,140
That house was there,

1101
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,220
但剩下的房子不在

1102
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,220
but the rest of these houses weren’t here,

1103
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,510
我爸爸把所有的不动产买下

1104
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,510
and my dad bought all the property, and

1105
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,030
一栋栋卖出去

1106
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,030
sold each one of the lots

1107
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,930
这样，他就可以决定他和谁做邻居

1108
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,930
decide who his neighbors were gonna be.

1109
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,860
这是我以前的房子

1110
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,860
This is my old house.

1111
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,030
我住过的第二栋房子

1112
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,030
The second house.

1113
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,620
里面充满了死亡

1114
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,620
It’s full of death.

1115
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,870
爸爸将卫斯理的死怪罪到他自己头上

1116
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,870
JACK: Dad blamed himself for Wesley’s death.

1117
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,680
卫斯理是由他照顾的

1118
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,680
Wesley was under his care,

1119
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,270
他没有尽到应尽的责任

1120
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,270
and he wasn’t as strict as he probably should have been

1121
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,350
没有严格督促卫斯理吃癫痫药物

1122
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,350
about making him take his epilepsy pills.

1123
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,520
摩西与他忠诚的追随者们一同行路

1124
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,520
Moses and his band of faithful followers.

1125
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,060
我们将前往应许之地

1126
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,060
We’re coming to the promised land.

1127
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,400
那地在约旦之上，红海以外

1128
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,400
That’s over Jordan and beyond the Red Sea.

1129

00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,590
卫斯理死后，我父亲所有的魅力和风采都消失不见

1136
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,590
JACK: After Wesley died, all of my father’s charisma vanished,

1137
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,930
他变成一个超脱而空虚的他自己

1138
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,930
and he became a detached and vacant version of himself.

1139
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,430
方：你在想什么？

1140
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,430
VAL: What you thinking about?

1141
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,490
我在想，能远离名为洛杉矶的人类文明地

1142
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,490
I’m thinking about how nice it is to be away from

1143
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,780
感觉有多好

1144
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,760
the civilization called Los Angeles.

1145
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,950
在这里，生活似乎有着更多的意义

1146
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,950
Life seems to have more meaning out here

1147
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,300
只要你能与它建立起连接

1148
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,300
if you can just get connected to it, huh?

1149
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,780
他的财务状况也急转直下

1150
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,780
JACK: His finances had also taken a turn for the worse.

1151
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,130
但他不想放弃他的梦想：

1152
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,130
But he was unwilling to give up his dream:

1153
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,460
成为加利福尼亚最顶级的土地大亨之一

1154
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,460
becoming one of California’s biggest land barons.

1155
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,460
所以，他来寻求我的帮助

1156
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,460
So he asked for my help.

1157
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,250
出演了几部电影以后，我开始赚钱

1158
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,250
After starring in a few films, I’d begun to make my own money

1159
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,130
他让我为他的贷款担保

1160
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,130
and was asked to cosign on his loans.

1161
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,850
That’s our property line right there?

1162
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,850
那里是我们的地基线吗？

1163
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,210
MAN: Yeah, that’s the property. This is lot number three.

1164
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,219
对，那边是不动产，这里是三号地界

1165
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,270
我想做他的好儿子

1166
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,270
JACK: I wanted to be a good son to him

1167
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,350
于是毫不犹豫地答应他的请求

1168
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,350
and agreed without much hesitation.

1169
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,940
方：我的父亲买下这里的一切

1170
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,940
VAL: My father bought all of this.

1171
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,320
这里的——一切

1172
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,320
All of this.

1173
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,370
EUGENE: Come over, Val, so we can show you...

1174
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,370
尤金：来吧，方，我们好给你看看...

1175
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,380
-方：好   -...我们在这做的事

1176
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,380
- VAL: Okay. - what we’re doing here.

1177
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,290
好交易

1178
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,290
Good deal.

1179
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,719
尤金：在这里，我们要搞十英尺的...

1180
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,719
EUGENE: So, we’re coming here with a ten-foot...

1181
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,500
我把自主权交给我父亲

1182
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,500
JACK: I gave my father power of attorney,

1183
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,920
他在我的名下登记了二十多家影子公司

1184
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,920
and he put my name on over 20 phantom companies

1185
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,790
也就是一堆为了躲避税款的空壳

1186
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,790
that were shells in order to avoid taxes.

1187
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,970
他希望这能起作用，但是这没有

1188
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,970
He hoped it would work out, but when it didn’t,

1189
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,220
于是我必须做出一个选择：

1190
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,220
I had to make a choice:

1191
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,930
控告我的亲生父亲

1192
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,930
sue my own father

1193
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,070
或者写一张支票，付出我的一切

1194
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,070
or write a check for everything I had.

1195
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,690
我写了那张支票，然后回去工作了

1196
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,690
I wrote the check and got back to work.

1197
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,950
你看什么？

1198
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,950
What are you staring at?

1199
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,180
("Look at What the Light Did Now" by Little Wings playing)

1200
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,010
第一次在伦敦看她演出的几年以后

1201
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,010
JACK: A few years after first seeing her perform in London,

1202
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,140
命运奇迹般地将我和琼妮·威利聚在一起

1203
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,140
fate miraculously cast Joanne Whalley and I together

1204
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,930
共同出演电影[风云际会]

1205
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,930
in the movie Willow.

1206
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,480
我再一次不可救药地爱上她

1207
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,480
I fell in love with her all over again.

1235
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,540
but raised on Native American land in New Mexico.

1236
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,990
我和兄弟还是孩子的时候，他把我们带到那里

1237
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,990
When we were kids, he brought my brothers and I there

1238
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,330
去拜访我们祖父的坟墓

1239
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,330
to visit my grandfather’s grave.

1240
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,610
那一天，我灵魂深处的某些东西苏醒了

1241
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,610
That day, something deep in my spirit awoke

1242
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,240
就此，新墨西哥成为我的家

1243
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,240
and New Mexico became home to me.

1244
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,070
琼妮同意也把这儿当做她的家

1245
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,070
Joanne agreed to make it hers as well,

1246
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,570
我们决定在这里共同搭建一段美好的人生

1247
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,570
and we decided to build a beautiful life there together.

1248
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,410
（南方口音）：这是咱搁着这里的原因

1249
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,410
(Southern accent): This is the reason I’m here,

1250
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,830

1251
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,830
-and it’s the reason you’re here. -MAN: What?

1252
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,880
咱老爹，金·基默

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,880
My daddy, Gene Kilmer.

1254
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,550
他搁大概...28年前把我给孵出来了

1255
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,550
He spawned me now some 28 years ago.

1256
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,670
- 可不是   -嗯哼

1257
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,670
- Yeah, about that. - Mm-hmm.

1258
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,050
（正常口音）：好了，我们要切蛋糕了，爸

1259
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,050
(normal voice): Well, we’re gonna go cut the cake, Pop.

1260
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,180
好，我和你一起去

1261
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,180
Okay, I’ll be with you.

He’s freaked out and he said he saw the bogeyman, okay?

1279
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,040
所以我帮他把那东西拿走了，就是这样

1280
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,070
So I took it away for him. That’s all.

1281
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,030
我把它拿走了

1282
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,030
I took it away.

1283
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
我就是这个意思

1284
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
That’s all I’m saying.

1285
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,830
尽管我出演了一些电影

1286
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,830
JACK: Though I had starred in a few films,

1287
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,830
我还是没能追上白兰度的脚步

1288
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,830
I was hardly walking in Brando’s footsteps.

1289
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,500
好角色极其稀少，且相隔很远

1290
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,500
The best character roles were few and far between.

1291
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,130
因此，我不顾一切地拍摄试镜影片

1292
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,130
So I’d go out of my way to make audition tapes

1293
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,680
寄给我想要合作的导演

1294
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,680
for directors that I wanted to work with,

1295
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,010
为了我想扮演的角色

1296
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,010

[全金属外壳]试镜

00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,020
海军陆战队员不能在未经许可的情况下死亡

1299
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,020
Marines are not allowed to die without permission.

1300
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,980
因为我们是...

1301
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,980

听说斯坦利·库布里克计划拍摄[全金属外壳]的时候

1305
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,650
JACK: I made multiple tapes for Stanley Kubrick

1306
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,940
我录了好几段影片

1307
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,940
when I heard he was making Full Metal Jacket.

1308
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,400
我会向你展示四次拍摄

1309
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,400
I’m gonna give you about four takes

1310
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,660
在每一次使用不同的声音

1311
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,660
with some different voices.

1312
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,130

1313
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,130
I sure do like shooting people.

1314
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,370

1315
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,370

1316
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,000

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,000

1318
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,900
我的确喜欢杀人

1319
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,900
I sure do like killing people.

1320
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,960
我甚至飞了六千英里，亲自把录影带交给剧组

1321
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,960
JACK: I even flew 6,000 miles to hand-deliver it in person.

1322
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,870
我要在英格兰呆几天

1323
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,870
I’m in England now for a couple of days because I made

1324
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,930
因为我去年在这里拍了部电影，我还留着张票呢

1325
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,930
a film here last year and I still have a ticket back.

1326
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,020
我觉得，我可以顺路来一下，然后...

1327
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,020
And I thought that I would come by and...

1328
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,360
听听你的意见

1329
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,360
see how you felt about this.

1330
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,730
我还给马丁·斯科塞斯拍了段影片

1331
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,730
JACK: I also made a film for Martin Scorsese,

[好家伙]试镜

1333
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,360
我在里头扮演[好家伙]时期的亨利·希尔

1334
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,360
where I played Henry Hill around the time of Goodfellas.

1335
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,280
方：联调的家伙花了大把大把的钱想引我上钩

1336
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,280
VAL: The feds spent so much money to hook me.

1337
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,700
他们出动了窃听器、监视器和直升机

1338
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,700
They had wiretaps, surveillance, helicopters.

1339
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,200
他们给他准备的影片有一英里长

1340
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,200
They had a list a mile long for him.

1341
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,060
街上有大把大把的钱等着我去收

1342
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,060
I had a lot of money out on the street to collect,

1343
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,580
还有几笔生意要收尾

1344
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,580
several scores to wrap up.

1345
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,540
我意思是，最后的几天里，我真是争分夺秒

1346
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,540
I mean, I was really scrambling the last days there.

1347
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,670
当时非常危险

1348
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,670
It was very dangerous.

1349
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,140
杰克：这些尝试都失败了

1350
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,170
JACK: Those attempts didn’t work.

1351
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,100
但是当我听说，他们在筹备一部有关大门乐队的影片

1352
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,100
But when I heard they were making a Doors movie,

1353

我不拿到吉米·莫里森的角色是不可能的

1354
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,760
not playing Jim was not an option.

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,340
don’t believe in death,

1583
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,080
在我一整个人生中

1584
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,080
and my whole life I’ve

1585
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,250
我都在尝试把世界看做

1586
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,250
tried to see the world

1587
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,030
一个

1588
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,030
as one

1589
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,160
整体的生命

1590
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,160
piece of life.

1591
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,260
这是我的理解方式：

1592
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,260
That’s how I understand it right;

1593
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,840
当你拉远距离

1594
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,840
when you pull back

1595
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,680
俯瞰星球，你会看到

1596
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,680
from the planet, you see that

1597
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,570
我们共享一个

1598
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,570
we’re all one

1599
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,910
生命源泉

1600
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,910
life source.

1601
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,210
梅赛德斯（在电话里）：你好？

1602
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,210
MERCEDES (over phone): Hello?

1603
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,610
- 嗨，亲爱的    -嗨

1604
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,610
- Hi, sweetheart. - Hey.

1605
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,880
你还没准备好呢

1606
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,880
You’re not quite ready yet.

1607
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,470
快了

1608
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,470
Almost. (chuckles)

1609
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,850
好

1610
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,850
Okay.

1611
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,620
我要去...

1612
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,620
I’m going to come...

1613
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,370
我要去你那里，好吗？

1614
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,370
I’m going to come over to you, right?

1615
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,770
- 去接你？    -好的

1616
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,770
- Pick you up? - Okay.

1617
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,450
- 这么定了      -再见

1618
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,450
- All right. - Bye.

1619
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,500
琼妮：像个桃子

1620
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,500
JOANNE: It’s a peach.

1621
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,170
桃形小屁股

1622
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,170
It’s a peachy little bum.

1623
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,090
你干什么了？洒得整个肚子都是

1624
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,090
What did you do? It’s all over your belly.

1625
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,600
你是个脏脏小孩，看啊

1626
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,600
You dirty mate. Look.

1627
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,080
上帝啊

1628
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,080
Oh, my God.

1629
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,370
- 你觉得你很好玩儿，是不是？

1630
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,370
-You think you’re funny, don’t you? -(Val laughs)

1631
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,360
- 让我们把这个也脱了  - 方：好恶心

1632
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,360
-Well, let’s get this off, as well. -VAL: Ew.

1633
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,650
琼妮：好恶心

1634
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,650
JOANNE: Ew.

1635
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,680
方： 梅赛德斯第一个过肩镜头

1636
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,680
VAL: Mercedes’ first over the shoulder.

1637
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,400
别把孩子吵醒

1638
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,400
Don’t wake the child.

1639
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,960
对，你能做到

1640
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,960
Yeah, you can do it.

1641
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,840
我们是一个快乐的大家庭，是不是，亲爱的？

1642
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,840
We’re just one big happy family, aren’t we, honey?

1643
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,640
一个快乐的小家

1644
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,640
One small happy family.

1645
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,240
- 我的拖车    - 方：你来了

1646
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,240
- My trailer. - VAL: You’ve arrived.

1647
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,530
你是个...你是专家级的

1648
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,530
You’re a... you’re a pro.

1649
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,190
镜头拉近

1650
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,190
In close.

1651
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,400
谁才是真的？

1652
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,400
Who’s the real...?

1653
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,740
方： 看见了吧，要是你不在片尾放怀特·厄普本人的照片

1654
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,740
VAL: See, what a historian would say during the credits,

1655
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,630
看片的历史学家会说：咋回事？

1656
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,630
if you don’t show a picture of Wyatt Earp, it’s what?

1657
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,740
这个怀特·厄普，还是这个怀特·厄普？

1658
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,740
This Wyatt Earp or this Wyatt Earp?

1659
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,870
哪个是胶片拍的？

1660
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,870
Which one is Memorex?

1661
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,690
你来决定

1662
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,690
You be the judge.

1663
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,790
你失焦了，你不能离得这么近

1664
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,790
You’re out of focus. You can’t get that close.

1665
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,770
那玩意儿上有微距镜头吗？

1666
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,770
(chuckles): Do you have a macro lens on that thing?

1667
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,850
听着，死鬼

1668
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,850
Listen, conk.

1669
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,010
- 听着，死鬼     - 我死了，被干掉了

1670
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,010
- Listen, conky. - I’ve been conked.

1671
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,130
方： 这地方有很多爱

1672
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,130
-(laughter) -VAL: Lot of love on this location.

1673
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,970
这堆风滚草里有很多爱

1674
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,970
Lot of love in these tumbleweeds.

1675
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,610
鲍沃斯·布斯：这是一次极其不同寻常的体验

1676
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,610
POWERS BOOTHE: It’s an extremely unusual experience.

1677
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,930
我们在剧院里会谈起它

1678
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,930
It’s one we used to talk about

1679
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,410
就是你特别想要

1680
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,410
in the theater, that you really want

1681
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,100
一种相辅相成的合奏感

1682
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,100
an ensemble feeling and all those things

1683
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,140
哪怕真能实现，也非常稀少

1684
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,140
that are rarely, if ever, achieved.

1685
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,770
- 科特·罗素：你在拍吗？继续拍        - 方：嗯哼

1686
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,770
-KURT RUSSELL: Are you filming? Stay filming. -VAL: Uh-huh.

1687
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,900
哇哦！

1688
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,900
- Whoa! - (laughing)

1689
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,870
医生已上线

1690
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,650
医生上线了

1691
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,650
Doctor’s in.

1692
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,030
我是你要找的人

1693
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,030
I’ll be your huckleberry.

1694
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,200
「医生」·霍利德是一个受过良好教育的精英阶层

1695
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,200
JACK: Doc Holliday was a highly educated aristocrat

1696
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,370
还是——还是位牙医

1697
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,370
and-and a dentist.

1698
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,660
真的？

1699
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,660
Really?

1700
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,460
- 开拍，莉兹      - 开始拍摄

1701
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,460
- MAN: Roll, Liz. - We’re rolling.

1702
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,420
他罹患肺结核，差点死去

1703
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,420
JACK: He was also dying of tuberculosis

1704
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,230
失去了一切，并因肺结核无法继续行医

1705
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,230
and lost everything, including his practice, because of it.

1706
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,890
只有写得不好的时候，才会出现难搞的角色

1707
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,890
Tough roles are when the writing’s not good,

1708
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,210
但电影写的很好

1709
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,210
and the writing was good.

1710
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,520
霍利德医生被塑造得很好

1711
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,520
Doc Holliday’s a very well-written character.

1712
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,950
五百块

1713
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,950
Five hundred.

1714
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,470
一定得走大运才行

1715
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,470
Must be a peach of a hand.

1716
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,810
那的确是一种享受，不过...

1717
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,810
So it was just a pleasure, but it’s all...

1718
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,240
一切都被写好了

1719
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,240
it’s in the writing.

1720
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,770
我把[墓碑镇]看作两个男人的爱情故事

1721
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,770
JACK: I saw Tombstone as a love story between two men.

1722
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,000
电影的结尾，医生濒临死亡

1723
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,000
In the final scene, Doc, who’s dying,

1724
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,060
他试着让怀特离开他，去继续怀特自己的生活

1725
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,060
tries to get Wyatt to leave him and go live his life.

1726
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,280
我让道具部把我的床塞满冰块

1727
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,280
I got the art department to fill my bed with ice

1728
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,920
然后躺在上面

1729
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,920
so I could lay on top of it.

1730
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,980
我想为我自己创造一种痛苦

1731
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,980
I wanted to create a pain for myself equal to the pain

1732
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,390
而它要等同于医生在告别时感受到的那种痛苦

1733
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,390
Doc must have felt in saying goodbye.

1734
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,190
这是我能想到的最好的方式

1735
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,190
It was the best way I could come up with

1736
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,790
用来最真实地展现他们美丽的友情

1737
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,790
to do justice to their beautiful friendship.

1738
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,860
活下去，怀特

1739
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,860
(quietly): Live, Wyatt.

1740
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,580
为我而活

1741
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,580
Live for me.

1742
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,910
怀特，如果你真的是我的朋友

1743
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,910
Wyatt, if you ever were my friend,

1744
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,210
如果你对我有那么一丁点儿感情

1745
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,210
if you ever had even the slightest feeling for me,

1746
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,030
现在就走

1747
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,030
leave now.

1748
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,650
赶快离开

1749
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,650
Leave now.

1750
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,810
求你了

1751
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,810
Please.

1752
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,020
奥斯汀 \N得克萨斯

1753
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,550
- 你想扔把战斧试试？    - 当然，为啥不呢

1754
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,550
- You want to throw a tomahawk? - Sure, why not?

1755
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,470
来吧

1756
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,470
Come on.

1757
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,040
嘿！

1758
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,040
Hey!

1759
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,300
准备好

1760
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,300
Ready.

1761
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,550
{\i1}你有五分钱吗？我有一角银币{\i0}

1762
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,550
♪ Have you got a nickel? ’Cause I got a dime ♪

1763
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,630
{\i1}让我们一起去喝一杯...{\i0}

1764
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,630
♪ Let’s get together and drink... ♪

1765
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,970
女人：我可以帮你拍照

1766
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,970
WOMAN: I’ll take a photo for you.

1767
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,310
好了。准备好了吗？

1768
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,310
Oh, I got it. Ready to do this?

1769
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,350
你可以进来了，你叫什么？

1770
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,350
WOMAN 2: Yeah, you can go on in. What’s your name?

1771
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,020
- 史蒂夫     - 好的，史蒂夫，来吧

1772
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,020
-MAN: Steve. -WOMAN 2: Steve. Oh, I got it. There we go.

1773
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,620
史蒂夫，这是方

1774
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,620
Steve, this is Val.

1775
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,650
哎呦我去

1776
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,650
Holy cow.

1777
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,920
- 这是给你的   - 你好

1778
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,920
- This is for you. - Howdy.

1779
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,610
- 你怎么样？   - 不太坏

1780
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,610
- STEVE: How you doing? - Not bad.

1781
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,790
- 站到那里，我要拍照了。   - 好嘞

1782
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,790
-Hop in there. I’ll get your photo. -STEVE: All right.

1783
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,210
我很喜欢你的电影

1784
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,210
I enjoy your films.

1785
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,090
非常感谢

1786
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,090
Thank you so much.

1787
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,870
雷霆之心

1788
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,870
Thunderheart.

1789
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,020
对

1790
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,020
Yeah.

1791
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,250
非常感谢，先生

1792
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,250
Thank you very much, sir.

1793
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,880
我们是群书呆子，所以我们会玩万智牌

1794
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,880
We’re nerds, so we play Magic: The Gathering.

1795
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,180
那是个卡牌游戏

1796
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,180
It’s a card game.

1797
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,780
- 我们为你做了这个    - 谢谢

1798
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,780
- So we made that for you. - Thank you.

1799
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,320
背面还有一节给你的圣经经文

1800
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,320
There’s a Bible verse on the back there for you.

1801
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,760
好极了

1802
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,760
Fantastic.

1803
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,410
方·基默 "上帝的选民"

1804
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,410
Val Kilmer "Chosen by God."

1805
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,600
非常感谢你，先生

1806
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,600
MAN: Thank you very much, sir.

1807
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,280
一，二，三

1808
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,280
WOMAN: One, two, three.

1809
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,150
在南印度，他让我大吃一惊

1810
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,150
He blew my mind in South India.

1811
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,570
- 方无处不在   - 是的，伙计

1812
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,570
- Val gets around. - MAN: Yeah, man.

1813
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,640
我在南印度让他大吃一惊

1814
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,640
I blew his mind in South India.

1815
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,050
下一个？

1816
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,050
WOMAN: Who’s next?

1817
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,590
主办方：方·基默在这里，我们要一起看[墓碑镇]

1818
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,590
EMCEE: Val Kilmer is here, and we’re gonna watch Tombstone

1819
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,040
——就在这块屏幕上

1820
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,040
- on this screen. - (crowd cheering)

1821
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,090
方：我一直很喜欢这儿

1822
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,090
VAL: I always love it here

1823
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,080
喜欢德克萨斯

1824
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,080
in Texas because

1825
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,470
因为我父亲在这里出生

1826
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,470
my father was born here.

1827
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,230
虽然他已经去世了

1828
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,230
Even though he passed on,

1829
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,750
每次来得州，我都感觉离他很近

1830
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,750
I always feel close by when I come to Texas.

1831
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,710
并且...

1832
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,710
- (cheering) - And, um...

1833
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,420
并且，呃

1834
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,420
and, um,

1835
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,930
我在这里度过了非常愉快的时间

1836
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,930
I’m having such a great time here.

1837
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,300
我想感谢所有人

1838
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,300
I’d like to thank everybody for

1839
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,570
谢谢你们举办了这样精彩的活动

1840
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,570
- putting on such a great show. - (cheering)

1841
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,760
主办方：女士们先生们，方·基默与我们在一起

1842
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,760
EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, Val Kilmer is here with us

1843
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,260
一同在西部小镇观看[墓碑镇]！

1844
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,260
for Tombstone in a Western town!

1845
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,900
方：有时候

1846
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,900
VAL: Sometimes

1847
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,250
我感到非常低落，甚至到了忧郁症的程度

1848
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,250
I feel so low and I have the blues

1849
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,630
非常、非常难受

1850
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,630
really, really hard

1851
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,100
因为我必须

1852
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,100
about having to,

1853
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,630
在国内四处飞

1854
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,630
you know, fly around the country.

1855
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,440
我看起来不好

1856
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,440
I don’t look great and

1857
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:31,410
本质上，我在兜售以前的我，售卖我曾经的事业

1858
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:31,410
I’m selling basically my old self, my old career.

1859
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,040
对很多人来说

1860
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,040
For many people,

1861
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,110
这是一个人能做的最低贱的事

1862
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,110
it’s like the lowest thing you can do is

1863
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,410
讲述你旧时的图片...

1864
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,410
talk about your old pictures and sell photographs of...

1865
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,960
售卖你以前演蝙蝠侠时的照片

1866
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,960
of when you were Batman or

1867
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,250
或者演终结者

1868
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,250
the Terminator.

1869
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,390
我不想侮辱其他任何

1870
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,390
I don’t want to insult any of the other actors

1871
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,220
满世界飞的演员

1872
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,220
that fly around the world.

1873
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,940
五百块钱

1874
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,940
Five hundred.

1875
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,660
一定得走大运才行

1876
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,660
Must be a peach of a hand.

1877
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,920
但这让我能够

1878
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,920
VAL: But it enables me to

1879
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,370
见到我的粉丝，同时...

1880
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,370
meet my fans and...

1881
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,260
最终发生的是

1882
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,260
and what ends up happening is

1883
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:24,810
我衷心地感到感激，而没有感到羞辱

1884
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:24,810
I feel really grateful rather than humiliated

1885
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,030
因为每一次都有那么多人

1886
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,030
because there’s so many people.

1887
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,900
来吧

1888
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,900
ED BAILEY: Come on.

1889
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,060
来吧，摊牌

1890
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,060
Come on, show.

1891
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,140
大家都注意了吗？

1892
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,140
Is everybody paying attention?

1893
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,230
我要为你们解答最大的谜语

1894
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,230
I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.

1895
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,710
所有谜题之母

1896
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,710
The mother of all riddles.

1897
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,250
谁是...蝙蝠侠？

1898
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,250
Who is... Batman?

1899
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,170
方：你找见他了？

1900
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,170
VAL: You see him?

1901
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,190
- 看到了吗？       - 嗯

1902
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,190
- MAN: See? - Yeah.

1903
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,880
- 哦          - 方：我去          - 他生大气了

1904
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,880
- MAN: Oh. -VAL: Whew. - MAN 2: He’s pissed.

1905
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,090
- 我草，看看这个头，感受到了吗？           -方：嗯呢

1906
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,090
-MAN: Fuck, look at that head, eh? -VAL: Yeah.

1907
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,510
我经纪人打来电话的时候，我正在非洲

1908
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,510
JACK: I was in Africa when I got a call from my agent,

1909
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,790
他疯狂地试图联系上我

1910
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,790
who had been frantically trying to get ahold of me.

1911
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,310
他问我，我想不想成为下一任蝙蝠侠

1912
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,310
He asked me how I’d feel about being the next Batman.

1913
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,100
我大为震惊，几乎不敢相信

1914
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,100
I was in shock and disbelief,

1915
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,760
主要因为，当时我正在探索一个偏远的蝙蝠洞

1916
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,760
mostly because I had just been exploring a remote bat cave

1917
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,700
这也是为什么没人联系得上我

1918
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,700
and that’s why I was so hard to reach.

1919
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,890
那是一个预兆

1920
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,890
It was a sign.

1921
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,600
每个男孩儿都梦想成为蝙蝠侠

1922
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,600
Every boy dreams of being Batman.

1923
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,260
蝙蝠侠是没有超能力的超级英雄

1924
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,260
Batman is a superhero without any superpowers.

1925
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,560
就是个普通人

1926
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,560
Just a normal guy.

1927
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,410
有那么几天，你就是没法摆脱炸弹的困扰

1928
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,410
Some days, you just can’t get rid of a bomb.

1929
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,880
但是他做了许多不可思议的事

1930
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,880
JACK: But he does incredible things

1931
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,480
利用他的智慧

1932
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,480
using his own intelligence

1933
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,430
和他的神奇小发明

1934
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,430
and the amazing gadgets he invents.

1935
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,050
每个男孩儿都梦想成为蝙蝠侠

1936
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,050
Every boy dreams of being Batman

1937
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,280
因为你真的有可能成为他

1938
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,280
because it actually is possible to be him.

1939
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,900
我二年级的时候

1940
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,900
When I was in second grade,

1941
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,540
我的家庭被邀请去蝙蝠侠电视剧的拍摄现场

1942
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,540
our family was invited to the set of the Batman TV show.

1943
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,670
时至今日，我最美好的记忆之一

1944
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,670
To this day, one of my dearest memories

1945
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,470
是我的父亲把我举起来，放进蝙蝠车

1946
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,470
is that of my father lifting me into the Batmobile.

1947
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,260
从好莱坞的标准来看

1948
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,260
By Hollywood standards,

1949
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,420
蝙蝠侠是终极主角

1950
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,420
Batman is the ultimate leading role

1951
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,000
是梦想得以实现

1952
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,000
and a dream come true.

1953
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,770
我连剧本都没看就接下角色

1954
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,770
I took the part without even reading the script.

1955
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,540
新闻主持人：迈克尔·基顿已经放下过去

1956
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,540
-(whooshing) -NEWSMAN: Michael Keaton has moved on.

1957
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:46,100
轮到方·基默穿上蝙蝠侠的橡胶战衣

1958
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:46,100
Val Kilmer has moved into the rubber body armor of Batman.

1959
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:48,190
标记点

1960
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:48,190
MAN: Mark.

1961
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:51,290
但我孩子气的兴奋

1962
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:51,290
JACK: But whatever boyish excitement I had going in

1963
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,780
很快就被蝙蝠战衣带来的现实碾碎

1964
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,780
was crushed by the reality of the Batsuit.

1965
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,820
当你穿上战衣，你几乎无法动弹

1966
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,820
When you’re in it, you can barely move

1967
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,290
需要有人帮你站起来或者坐下

1968
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,290
and people have to help you stand up and sit down.

1969
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,000
可怜的方，他一戴上面具

1970
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,000
Poor Val would have to put the mask on

1971
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,720
就什么都听不见

1972
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,720
and couldn’t hear when he had it on

1973
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,870
也没法好好呼吸

1974
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,870
and couldn’t breathe properly.

1975
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,420
同时，你什么都听不见

1976
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,420
JACK: You also can’t hear anything.

1977
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,000
一会儿之后，人们便不再和你说话

1978
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,000
And after a while, people stop talking to you.

1979
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,950
你被世界孤立

1980
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,950
It’s very isolating.

1981
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,150
演大概一个小时，你就会倒下

1982
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,150
Do about an hour of acting, and then you fall down...

1983
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,480
过度呼吸，急需氧气和水

1984
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,480
(chuckles): hyperventilate and need oxygen and water.

1985
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,150
对我来说，隔着那层战衣演戏

1986
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,150
JACK: It was a struggle for me

1987
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,310
是一种挣扎

1988
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,310
to get a performance past the suit,

1989
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,670
我十分沮丧，直到我意识到

1990
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,670
and it was frustrating until I realized that my role

1991
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520


1992
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,380
我在电影里的作用只有出现在我该在的时候、站在我该站的地方

1993
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,380
in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.

1994
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,050
其他演员，比如汤米·李·琼斯...

1995
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,050
VAL: Actors like Tommy Lee Jones...

1996
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,150
哈！我们这一天

1997
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,150
Ha! Our kind of day.

1998
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,360
设计了一整出表演

1999
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,360
had designed this whole performance,

2000
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,500
金·凯利也是

2001
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,500
and so had Jim Carrey.

2002
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,420
迷迷这个，猜猜那个

2003
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,420
Riddle me this, riddle me that.

2004
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,010
是不是太夸张了？我可说不好

2005
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,010
Was that over-the-top? I can never tell.

2006
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,160
它是那样盛大

2007
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,160
It was just so huge.

2008
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,150
我觉得我做啥事都没区别

2009
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,150
I think it made no difference what I was doing.

2010
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,300
我试着做一个

2011
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,300
I tried to be like an

2012
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,010
肥皂剧现场的演员

2013
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,010
actor on a soap opera.

2014
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,890
我转向妮可的方式

2015
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,890
The way I would turn to Nicole.

2016
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,650
蝙蝠信号灯不是传呼机

2017
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,650
Bat-Signal is not a beeper.

2018
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,290
我希望我对你的兴趣...

2019
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,290
Well, I wish I could say that my interest in you was

2020
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,250
也仅仅是出于我的职业

2021
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,250
purely professional.

2022
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,600
数数我有多少次

2023
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,600
Go count how many times

2024
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,730
把手放在我的屁股上

2025
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,730
I put my hands on my hips.

2026
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,620
我不知道他们是怎么琢磨出

2027
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,620
I don’t know how they come up with this

2028
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,050
这种表演方式

2029
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,050
style of acting,

2030
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,690
但是他们似乎...

2031
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,690
but they seem to go...

2032
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,020
毕业于肥皂剧学院

2033
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,020
go to soap opera school.

2034
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,610
"为什么，为什么，你为什么说那种话？"

2035
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,610
"Why, why, why would you say that?"

2036
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,180
我在蝙蝠侠收工的那天

2037
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,180
JACK: The day I wrapped Batman,

2038
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,580
我立马跳进汽车，冲向[盗火线的片场]

2039
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,580
I jumped in the car and went immediately to the set of Heat.

2040
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,130
相比于蝙蝠侠电影庞大的制作规模

2041
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,130
Compared to the massive production of Batman,

2042
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,420
[盗火线]感觉就像一部独立电影

2043
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,420
Heat felt like an indie film.

2044
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,450
和阿尔·帕西诺

2045
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,450
Working with Al Pacino,

2046
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,070
罗伯特·德·尼罗

2047
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,070
Robert De Niro

2048
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,750
和导演迈克尔·曼一起工作是纯粹的享受

2049
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,750
and director Michael Mann was pure joy.

2050
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,600
盗火线（1995）

2051
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,600
记不记得蹲号子的时候，牢里的吉米·麦卡文经常说

2052
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,600
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard used to say,

2053
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,530
"你想在大街上讨生计？

2054
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,530
"You want to be making moves on the street?

2055
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,820
"那就得毫无羁绊

2056
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,820
"Have no attachments.

2057
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,770
"要是有个东西拖住你的脚步

2058
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,770
"Allow nothing to be in your life

2059
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,910
"警察上门的时候，你没法在30秒内了无牵挂地走掉

2060
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,910
"that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat

2061
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,110
"那就把那东西扔了。"

2062
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,110
if you spot the heat around the corner."

2063
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,020
还记得吗？

2064
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,020
Remember that?

2065
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,530
对我来说，太阳与她一同起落，老兄

2066
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,530
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.

2067
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,120
好了，让我们来聊聊蝙蝠侠

2068
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,120
Well, let’s talk about Batman now.

2069
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,730
说到这我就不困了：你出演蝙蝠侠

2070
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,730
Now, this is kind of neat. You’re playing Batman.

2071
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,380
新闻主播：蝙蝠侠成为本年度头号电影

2072
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,380
NEWSWOMAN: Batman became the number one movie of the year

2073
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,660
票房达到1.83亿美元

2074
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,660
with $183 million.

2075
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,060
方·基默是蝙蝠侠

2076
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,060
NEWSWOMAN 2: Val Kilmer is Batman.

2077
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,700
大多数时候，你只能看见他的嘴唇

2078
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,700
Most of the time, all you see is his lips,

2079
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,010
谁又知道那是他呢？

2080
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,010
so who would know anyway?

2081
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,230
火辣登场

2082
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,230
Hot entrance.

2083
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,520
杰克：[永远的蝙蝠侠]收获了褒贬不一的评价

2084
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,520
JACK: Batman Forever got mixed reviews

2085
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,530
但是，它取得巨大的商业成功

2086
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,530
but was a commercial success.

2087
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,370
他们想立刻开拍下一部

2088
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,370
They wanted to start the next one immediately.

2089
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,490
我退出了

2090
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,490
I turned it down.

2091
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,570
我已经全身心投入到[圣徒]里

2092
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,570
I was already committed to The Saint,

2093
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,370
这是一部翻拍自英国谍战惊悚剧的电影

2094
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,370
a remake of a British spy thriller series

2095
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,960
我在其中扮演的角色拥有多个人格和伪装

2096
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,960
where I’d get to play a character who dons multiple personas and disguises.

2097
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,420
就像是同时出演十个角色，这是我更想做的

2098
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,420
It was like ten roles in one, and I wanted to do that more.

2099
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,170
方：我看见什么了，杰克？

2100
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,170
VAL: What’s that I see, Jack?

2101
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,760
蝙蝠车呃呃呃

2102
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,760
Batmobile!

2103
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,060
- 那是我的吗，爸比？        - 是的！

2104
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,060
- Is that mine, Daddy? - Yeah!

2105
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,550
好了吗？

2106
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,550
VAL: Ready?

2107
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:19,960
准备好了吗，蝙蝠侠？

2108
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:19,960
Are you all ready, Batman?

2109
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,210
快，左转弯！

2110
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,210
Quick, turn left.

2111
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,780
就是这条路。转弯，转弯！

2112
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,780
That’s this way. Turn, turn.

2113
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,550
杰克：是的，每个孩子都想成为蝙蝠侠

2114
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,550
JACK: Yes, every boy wants to be Batman.

2115
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,690
他们确确实实地想成为他

2116
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,690
They actually want to be him.

2117
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,350
他们不一定想在电影里扮演他

2118
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,350
They don’t necessarily want to play him in a movie.

2119
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,510
- 方，方，方，方，方          - 方，方，方，方·基默

2120
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,510
- Val, Val, Val, Val, Val. - Val, Val, Val, Val Kilmer.

2121
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,560
你能不能在这里写"你可以做我的僚机"？

2122
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,560
Is it possible to write "You can be my wingman" on there?

2123
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,140
不好意思，你能在这一张上签"冰人"吗？

2124
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,140
Sorry, can you put "Iceman" on that one?

2125
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,430
你能写"你能做我的僚机"吗？

2126
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,430
Would you write "You can be my wingman"?

2127
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,340
这张上签"你能做我的僚机"

2128
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,340
"You can be my wingman" on this one.

2129
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,610
你能在这一张也签上"冰人"吗，方？

2130
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,610
Can you put "Iceman" on it as well, please, Val?

2131
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,590
你能写"你随时可以做我的僚机"吗？

2132
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,590
Can you put "You can be my wingman anytime"

2133
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,140
然后写"方·基默，冰人"？

2134
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,140
and then "Val Kilmer, Iceman"?

2135
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,390
我想休息一下

2136
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,390
I wanna take a break.

2137
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,680
你确实想休息一下？好

2138
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,680
You want to take a break anyway? Okay.

2139
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,720
- 对，我的胃...             - 好，没事，让我...

2140
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,720
- Yeah, my stomach... - Okay, okay. All right. Let me...

2141
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,790
- 嘿，金？           - 嗯？

2142
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,790
- Hey, Kim? - Yep.

2143
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,430
我们能不能解决剩下的几个人？

2144
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,430
Can we just finish these last few people?

2145
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,000
封闭这个区域，要是可以...

2146
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,000
Want to lock it down, if they would...

2147
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,590
亚西姆，让他们把人先拦一下

2148
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,590
Yaseem, tell them to hold the people.

2149
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,230
把人拦住，谢谢你

2150
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,230
Hold the people. Thank you.

2151
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,940
- 我想躺下                   - 好

2152
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,940
- I wanna lay down. - Okay.

2153
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,640
- 谢谢你          - 嘿，太感谢你了

2154
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,640
- Thank you. - MAN: Hey, thank you so much.

2155
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,870
方，你想拿那个人的签名怎么办？

2156
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,870
So, Val, what do you want to do with that guy’s autos?

你好，梅赛德斯

2208
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,890
Hello, Mercedes.

2209
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,070
我们正在讨论那些令人害怕的东西

2210
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,070
We were talking about things that are scary,

2211
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,610
然后你说，你最害怕的

2212
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,610
and you said the only things that you were afraid of

2213
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,360
是你的梦

2214
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,360
were your dreams.

2215
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,810
没多少事会让我害怕

2216
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,810
Not many things scare me.

2217
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,000
但的确有一个，呃...

2218
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,000
But one thing kind of is, um...

2219
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,520
能吓到我的

2220
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,520
Scary.

2221
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,560
严格意义上，它不会吓到我

2222
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,560
It’s not exactly scary

2223
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:40,340
却让我很担心

2224
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:40,340
but one thing that I’m concerned about.

2225
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,080
我担心

2226
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,080
I’m concerned

2227
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,580
我能不能为你和杰克

2228
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,580

2229
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,420

Let’s all, let’s all kiss.

2283
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,270
杰克：[勇闯人魔岛]是我

2284
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,270
JACK: The Island of Dr. Moreau was my chance

2285
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,050
终于能和马龙·白兰度合作的机会

2286
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,050
to finally work with Marlon Brando.

2287
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,330
从最开始，这部电影就完蛋了

2288
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,330
The movie was doomed from the start.

2289
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,350
我们第一个导演，理查德·斯坦李非常有才华

2290
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,350
Our first director, Richard Stanley, who was talented

2291
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,500
但是没执导过这么大规模的片子

2292
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,500
but had never directed anything of this scale,

2293
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,470
所以一开始拍摄，他就被换掉了

2294
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,470
was replaced after he started shooting

2295
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,300
换成了经验丰富的约翰·弗兰肯海默

2296
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,300
by the experienced John Frankenheimer.

2297
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,460
弗兰肯海默的任务是产出一部成品

2298
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,460
Frankenheimer, tasked with getting a production

2299
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,480
但他已经落后进度好几周

2300
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,480
already weeks behind under control,

2301
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,760
他想尽可能快地拍完这部电影

2302
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,760
was intent on finishing the film as quickly as possible,

2303
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,910
他不想花费时间

2304
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,910
and was unwilling to take the time

2305
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,640
思考马龙的提议

2306
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,640
to explore Marlon’s ideas.

2307
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,660
当马龙领悟到这一点以后，他就不再提建议了

2308
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,660
When this became clear to Marlon, he stopped trying

2309
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,820
不再将他天才的思维供给电影

2310
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,820
to inject his own genius into the film.

2311
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,590
对我而言，这是毁灭性的打击

2312
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,590
This was devastating to me.

2313
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,500
方：那不是马龙

2314
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,500
VAL: That’s not Marlon.

2315
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,340
女人：他今天不来片场

2316
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,340
WOMAN: He’s not coming in today.

2317
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,090
方：有人告诉过你

2318
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,090
VAL: Did anybody tell you that

2319
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,230
马龙今天不来上班吗，大卫？      - 没有

2320
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,230
- Marlon wasn’t working today, David? - No.

2321
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,190
- 也没人告诉我         - 你不会注意到的

2322
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,190
- No one told me, either. - You don’t notice.

2323
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,640
- 你能认出那不是他吗？       - 什么？

2324
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,640
- Can you tell it’s not him? - What?

2325
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,300
- 你能认出那不是他吗？        - 不，你根本分辨不出来

2326
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,300
- Can you tell it’s not him? - No, you can’t even tell,

2327
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,880
引述约翰·弗兰肯海默的话就是："这有问题吗？"

2328
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,880
to quote John Frankenheimer. What’s the problem?

2329
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,920


2330
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,810
- 你甚至分辨不出来          - 那人看上去和他一模一样

2331
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,810
- You can’t even tell. - This guy’s exactly like him.

2332
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,660
方：你叫什么？

2333
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,660
VAL: What’s your name?

2334
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,240
- 诺姆          - 诺姆

2335
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,240
- Norm. - Norm.

2336
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,810
你帅呆了，诺姆

2337
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,810
You’re rockin’, Norm.

2338
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,860
（小声）：马龙·白兰度由诺姆扮演

2339
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,860
(quietly): Marlon Brando’s played by Norm.

2340
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,960
退后，退后！

2341
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,960
Back! Back!

2342
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,700
女人：不，道格拉斯，不！

2343
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,700
WOMAN: No! Douglas, no!

2344
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,910
不！不！！

2345
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,910
No! No!

2346
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,850
男人：他不会伤害我们的

2347
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,850
MAN: He won’t hurt us.

2348
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,360
方：我能帮助你吗？

2349
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,360
VAL: Can I help you in any way?

2350
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,730
呃...

2351
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,730
Um...

2352
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,410
或许，如果我表演得更好一些？

2353
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,410
Maybe if I acted better?

2354
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,150
不，不是因为那个

2355
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,150
No, that’s not it.

2356
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,580
好吧

2357
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,580
Okay

2358
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,840
要是我能为你做什么，就告诉我

2359
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,840
Let me know if there is anything I can do for you.

2360
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,150
- 剧本        - 剧本

2361
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,150
- The writing. - Writing.

2362
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,850
要不要我们聚到一起写？

2363
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,850
Should we get together and write?

2364
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,430
索菲亚，我在这一幕要吸烟吗？

2365
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,430
Sophie, was I smoking in this?

2366
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,480
把这些雨伞拿走

2367
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,480
Get those umbrellas out of there.

2368
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,220
- 来吧！开始拍摄            - 开拍？

2369
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,220
- Let’s go! Roll! - Roll?

2370
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,870
你需要什么？告诉我你需要...

2371
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,870
What do you need? Tell me what you...

2372
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,980
说英语，去吧

2373
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,980
Speak English. Go.

2374
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,990
男人：好了，他不让我进去

2375
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,990
MAN: Right. He won’t let me get in.

2376
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:38,440
- 比尔：你想给演员们穿鞋子？      -对

2377
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:38,440
-BILL: You want shoes for the cast? -Yes.

2378
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:40,990
我没穿鞋

2379
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:40,990
I have no shoes on.

2380
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,700
非常有洞察力。这是蓝色的

2381
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,700
Very observant of you. This is blue.

2382
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,080
- 记住，我看见了         - 我当时就在那儿

2383
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,080
- Remember, I saw that. - I’m right over there.

2384
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,280
谢谢你的——你的关心，比尔

2385
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,280
Thanks for your-your concern, Bill.

2386
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,400
我们有没有讨论过遮挡或者这一幕里发生的事？

2387
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,400
Have we discussed the blocking or what happens in this scene?

2388
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,860
- 没有           - 没有。你是说"没有"吗？

2389
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,860
- No. - No. Did you say "no"?

2390
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,700
- 没有             - 是的，谢谢你

2391
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,700
- No. - Yeah. Thank you.

2392
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,150
杰克：与我的英雄一起拍摄一部伟大电影的机会

2393
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,150
JACK: The chance to make a great film

2394
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,230
悄然溜走了

2395
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,230
with my hero, slipping away.

2396
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,900
在这一切的基础上

2397
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,900
And on top of everything,

2398
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,550
我们事业的压力和长时间的分离

2399
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,550
the strain of our careers and too much time apart

2400
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,260
对我的婚姻产生影响

2401
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,260
had taken its toll on my marriage,

2402
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:13,240
我在片场收到离婚协议书

2403
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:13,240
and I was served divorce papers on set.

2404
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,310
你懂的，约翰·弗兰肯海默会说"开拍"和"卡"说一整天

2405
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,310
You know, John Frankenheimer can say "action" and "cut" all day long,

2406
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,200
但这俩词永远不能让他成为好导演

2407
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,200
and it will never make him a director.

2408
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,710
开拍

2409
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,710
Action.

2410
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,360
约翰·弗兰肯海默：好了，这次真的越界了

2411
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,360
JOHN FRANKENHEIMER: Okay. Uh, this has just gone too far.

2412
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:34,450
我干不下去了

2413
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:34,450
I can’t do it.

2414
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,470
要是我们非得这样工作的话

2415
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,470
If we’re going to work this way.

2416
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,820
关掉录像机

2417
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,820
Shut the video camera off.

2418
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,050
方：我们要排练吗？

2419
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,050
VAL: Are we rehearsing?

2420
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,500
约翰：我们马上要排练

2421
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,500
JOHN: We are about to rehearse.

2422
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:42,080
能不能请你把录像机关了？

2423
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:42,080
Would you please shut the video camera off?

2424
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,060
方：不行，因为我现在高度情绪化

2425
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,060
VAL: No, because I’m in a highly emotional state,

2426
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,040
因为早些时候你对大卫和我说

2427
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,040
because you said earlier to David and I

2428
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,690
你要离开这部电影

2429
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,690
you were going to leave this movie.

2430
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,100
约翰：要是这一切继续的话，我不会...

2431
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,100
JOHN: If this continues, I will not...

2432
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,470
我没法在这种情况下发挥作用

2433
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,470
I do not see how I could function under these conditions.

2434
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,350
我应该进行创造性工作

2435
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,350
I’m supposed to be doing creative work

2436
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,690
现在的局面不利于创造出任何好场景

2437
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,690
and this is not conducive to creating a good scene.

2438
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,550
方：那么...

2439
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,550
VAL: Well...

2440
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,390
能等我一下吗，我现在很情绪化

2441
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,390
can I have a minute, because I’m in an emotional state

2442
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,370
我没法儿念我的台词

2443
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,370
and I won’t be able to read my lines.

2444
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,960
约翰：当然了，请尽管等一下

2445
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,960
JOHN: By all means, please have a minute.

2446
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,380
这么说吧，等你准备好排练的时候...

2447
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,380
I’ll tell you what. When you guys are ready to rehearse...

2448
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:09,280
方：我准备好排练了

2449
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:09,280
VAL: I’m ready to rehearse right now.

2450
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,290
约翰：关上录像机？

2451
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,290
JOHN: Shut the video camera off?

2452
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,980
方：鉴于你说过的话，我需要一个见证人

2453
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,980
VAL: I need a witness because of things you’ve said.

2454
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,770
约翰：我说过的话？

2455
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,770
JOHN: Things that I’ve said?

2456
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,410
方：对

2457
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,410
VAL: Yeah.

2458
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,890
你在两名主演面前争辩

2459
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,890
You’ve debated in front of your two lead actors

2460
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,460
你是否会继续执导这部电影

2461
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,460
on whether you will continue to direct this film.

2462
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,330
那影响了我的心态

2463
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,330
That puts me in a state of mind

2464
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,720
让我无法创作

2465
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,720
not conducive to creating.

2466
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,140
约翰：请把录像机关掉

2467
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,140
JOHN: Please shut the video camera off.

2468
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,510
方：我会一直开着，直到我们开始排练

2469
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,510
VAL: I will keep it on until we’re rehearsing.

2470
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,480
方（西班牙语）：马龙在哪儿？

2471
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,480
VAL: ¿Donde esta Marlon?

2472
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,840
呃，他在拐角后面

2473
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,840
Uh, he’s around the corner.

2474
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:43,840
方：谢谢

2475
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:43,840
VAL: Thanks.

2476
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,030
你最早的童年记忆是什么？

2477
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,030
What’s your earliest childhood memory?

2478
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,710
推我一下

2479
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,710
Gimme a shove.

2480
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,310
你能...你拥有开口说话以前的记忆吗？

2481
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,310
Can you... Do you have memories from before you could speak?

2482
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,000
使劲，使大劲推

2483
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,000
Big, big, big shove.

2484
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,560
对，不错

2485
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,560
Yeah. That’s good.

2486
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:19,100
啊，就是这样

2487
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:19,100
Ah, there we are.

2488
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,660
这个淡出画面不错

2489
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,660
This is a nice fade-out.

2490
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,890
方：我有权利合法地保有我的孩子

2491
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,890
VAL: I have a legal right to have my children

2492
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,990
我会最大限度地使用我的酌处权

2493
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,990
and use my best discretion.

2494
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,330
呃，我们在协议里没有写明任何东西

2495
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,330
Uh, we don’t have anything written in the agreement,

2496
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,600
我也不记得说过那方面的事

2497
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,600
and I don’t remember saying that anyway.

2498
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,700
如果法院命令这样说明了

2499
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,700
If that’s what the court order says,

2500
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,200
我就会这样做

2501
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,200
then that’s what I’ll do.

2502
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,560
好吧，每次...每次都这样

2503
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,560
Well, the... that happens every single time

2504
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,670
我们没有安排分开的时间，也没有就时间达成一致

2505
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,670
we don’t make separate time and agree about the time.

2506
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,370
我没有怪罪你

2507
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,370
I’m not saying you did it.

2508
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,730
我是说，我们不能当着他们的面做计划

2509
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,730
I’m saying we cannot do a schedule in front of them.

2510
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,370
要是你愿意那样做

2511
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,370
And if you’re willing to do that,

2512
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,390
你愿意再次经历那些冲突

2513
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,390
you’re willing to experience conflict like you had.

2514
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,510
我不想让它们发生在我家

2515
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,510
I’m not willing to experience it in my home

2516
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,960
或者你家

2517
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,960
or in your home.

2518
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,500
我不是在发泄情绪，我是从孩子的角度出发

2519
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,500
I’m not blowing off steam. I’m speaking directly

2520
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,450
他们最大的利益，就是他们和父母双方

2521
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,450
to the children’s best interest, which is the quality of time

2522
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,500
一同度过的时间的质量

2523
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,500
that they have with both parents.

2524
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,810
要是你不想和我交涉

2525
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,810
If you’re unwilling to negotiate with me,

2526
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,660
那我们只能和别人交涉

2527
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,660
then we have to negotiate with someone else.

2528
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,170
我会去警长办公室提出法律申诉

2529
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,170
I’ll lodge a legal complaint with the sheriff’s department

2530
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,590
因为现在是假期，法院没人上班

2531
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,590
since we can’t go through the court

2532
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,210
我们也就不能法庭上见

2533
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,210
’cause it’s the holidays and no one’s there,

2534
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,080
既然你不愿意和我交涉

2535
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,080
that you’re unwilling to negotiate with me,

2536
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,480
那必须有人来做

2537
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,480
and someone else has to do it.

2538
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,430
我会安排好...我必须做的事

2539
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,430
And I’ll check out what... what I have to do.

2540
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,510
要是我得合法地把他们在六点前带回来

2541
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,510
If I have to legally bring them back by 6:00,

2542
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:40,100
那我就会合法地这样做，就像前15次一样

2543
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:40,100
then I’ll try to legally, just like I did 15 times

2544
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,770
在过去两年里...

2545
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,770
in the last two years...

2546
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,560
够了！

2547
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,560
Enough!

2548
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,470
早上好

2549
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,470
Good morning.

2550
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,990
嗨，杰克。嗨，梅赛德斯

2551
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,990
Hi, Jack. Hi, Mercedes.

2552
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,160
在新墨西哥向你们说复活节快乐

2553
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,160
Happy Easter from New Mexico.

2554
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,300
看看我在仙人掌上...

2555
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,300
Look what I found...

2556
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,690
找到了什么

2557
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,690
in a cactus.

2558
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,640
多聪明的复活节兔子

2559
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,640
What a clever Easter Bunny.

2560
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,400
一个豆包鸭？

2561
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,400
A beanbag duck?

2562
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,850
你在新墨西哥干嘛呢

2563
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,850
What are you doing in New Mexico?

2564
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,560
哦，还有一个呢

2565
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,560
Oh, there’s another one.

2566
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,460
（捏尖嗓子）：我叫小粉

2567
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,460
(high-pitched voice): My name is Pinky.

2568
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,190
（正常声音）：嗨，小粉

2569
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,190
(normal voice): Hi, Pinky.

2570
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,450
你要和我们一起去加利福尼亚吗？

2571
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,450
Will you come with us to California?

2572
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,840
小溪在这边

2573
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,840
There’s the river.

2574
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:26,650
今天早上，它好美

2575
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:26,650
It’s beautiful this morning.

2576
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,570
真希望你们也在

2577
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,570
Wish you were here.

2578
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,480
表演非常有趣的一点是

2579
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,480
It’s really interesting in acting,

2580
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,330
你做出的很多事...

2581
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,330
where you do so many things that are...

2582
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,680
都对你的个人生活有着决定性的影响

2583
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,680
very final about your personal life.

2584
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,500
没有回头路

2585
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,500
There’s no turning back.

2586
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,800
你说"好"，同意拍摄一部电影

2587
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,800
You say yes and agree to do a film,

2588
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:30,040
然后就是——就是他们说的"演戏或者给钱"式合同

2589
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:30,040
then it’s-it’s a... what they call a "pay-or-play contract,"

2590
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,700
这些年里，很多合同变成法律官司

2591
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,700
and a lot of them have been lawsuits through the years.

2592
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,860
你口头答应的时候，一切就被定下来了

2593
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,860
They become final if you verbally agree.

2594
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,180
而且，呃...

2595
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,180
And, uh...

2596
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,030
你所同意的是

2597
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,030
it’s your, uh...

2598
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:47,840
放弃你

2599
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:47,840
actual life that you’re agreeing to...

2600
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,060
真实的人生

2601
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,060
forfeit.

2602
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:59,320
这是他们用钱买回来的东西里的一件

2603
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:59,320
It’s one of the things that they buy for all that money.

2604
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,200
他们——他们确实在一段时间里

2605
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,200
They-they actually buy your...

2606
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,350
买走了你的人生

2607
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,350
life for a period of time.

2608
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:07,030
你的经验，你的观点，你的...

2609
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:07,030
Your experience, your opinions, your...

2610
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:11,620
某种意义上，你的灵魂

2611
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:11,620
soul in a way.

2612
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,240
印第安人觉得——觉得照片

2613
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,240
The Indians thought that-that a photograph

2614
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,270
或者图像会带走...

2615
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,270
or the image took away...

2616
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,780
你的灵魂

2617
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,780
the soul, and it’s...

2618
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,150
有时候就是这种感觉

2619
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,150
it sometimes feels like that.

01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,890
放开那个人！

2636
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,890

我很失望，因为我必须做的事没有被拍下来

2648
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,450
I’m frustrated because what I have to do isn’t getting filmed

2649
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,400
因为导演无法把它们呈现出来

2650

’cause the director isn’t able to bring it out.

就在不久以前，知道如何演戏非常重要

2652
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:25,680
Not very long ago, it mattered if you knew how to act.

笑一笑，方，笑一笑

方：现在那反倒成为一种阻碍

2656
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,240
VAL: Now it actually is a deterrent.

2657
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,720
对，要是你懂得如何表演

2658
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,720
Yeah, if you know how to act,

2659
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,410
你懂，就是说——你可能会成为一个问题演员

2660
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,410
you know, you-you know, you-you could be a problem actor.

2661

2666
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,190
你就是问题，因为你很危险

2667
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,190
You, ’cause you’re dangerous.

2668
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,650
你是个完美主义者

2669
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,650
You are a perfectionist.

2670
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,290
你在感情上非常极端，你不认为吗？

成为，呃，我能成为的

2679
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:54,970
is to be, uh, the best

2680
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,400
最好的演员

2681
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,400

You know, you don’t.

2690
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:11,260

He sees deeply.

2699
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,690
我觉得他总是对的，有时甚至会错综复杂

2700
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,690
I think he was always right, and sometimes it’s convoluted.

2701

就像是，又是那些陈词滥调

她的发型，她的珠宝...

2807
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,500
Her hairdo and her jewelry...

2808
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,500
永远闪闪发光

2809
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,500
they always popped.

2810
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,830
我想我的妈妈

2811
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,830
I miss my mama.

2812
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:54,530
但我有一个愿景

2813
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:54,530
But I had a vision

2814
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:58,350
她与她最小的儿子在一起

2815
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:58,350
that she was so happy

2816
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,890
是那么幸福、开心

2817
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,890
with her youngest son.

2818
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,520
我所真正感兴趣的那种表演

2819
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,520
The kind of acting that I’m really interested in,

2820
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:15,150
我没怎么...没怎么在电影里做过

2821
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:15,150
I haven’t very... I haven’t done very much of in movies.

2822
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:19,260
这感觉很奇怪，因为我没法儿发牢骚

2823
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:19,260
So it’s a strange feeling, because I can’t really complain.

2824
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:21,370
我非常、非常幸运...

2825
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:21,370
I’m very, very fortunate, and...

2826
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:26,000
而且，呃，你没法儿真的和演员同行讨论这个问题

2827
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:26,000
and, um, you... you can’t really discuss it with other fellow actors,

2828
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,480
因为没人在演艺界有工作，所以你不能...

2829
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,480
because nobody has a job in acting, so you can’t...

2830
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:34,680
你不能抱怨你的工作

2831
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:34,680
you can’t, uh, complain about jobs

2832
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,230
尤其是抱怨你成功的工作

2833
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,230
or, especially, successful jobs.

2834
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,400
他们只会觉得你是个疯子，或者傻猪，这之类的

2835
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,400
Then they just think you’re crazy or a pig or something.

2836
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,110
试着调和是——是很难的

2837
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,110
So, uh, it’s-it’s a difficult thing, uh, trying to reconcile.

2838
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,970
生意随时都在改变，所以...

2839
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,970
And the business changes all the time, so...

2840
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:52,300
但我——我没有一开始那种疑虑了

2841
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:52,300
But I-I don’t have the kind of doubts I did when I started.

2842
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,780
而且我...我还是兴趣深厚

2843
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,780
And I’m in... I’m still interested

2844
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:57,920
想追求表演，并且，呃

2845
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:57,920
in pursuing acting, and it’s-it’s, uh,

2846
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,730
为学习人类而着迷，不过

2847
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,730
fascinating studying people, but, uh,

2848
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,860
我——我不觉得我会让自己

2849
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,860
I-I don’t think I would let myself

2850
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:07,430
再像以前那样激动

2851
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:07,430
get as worked up as I used to.

2852
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,630
方：在电影这一行里

2853
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,630
VAL: It’s very hard in the movie business

2854
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:48,740
要是想在某个层面上做点儿不同的事

2855
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:48,740
to do something different on any level

2856
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:52,120
你就只能孤身一人

2857
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:52,120
without being on your own.

2858
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,120
这就是发生在我身上的事

2859
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,120
And so that’s what happened to me.

2860
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,470
最终，我身处于持续的冲突中

2861
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,470
I just ended up in sort of constant conflicts with people

2862
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,980
和希望我去拍商业作品的人们不断地争吵

2863
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,980
that wanted me to do commercial work.

2864
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:09,040
我想导演一个庞大的美国故事

2865
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:09,040
I was looking for a big American story to direct.

2866
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,310
我发现了马克·吐温和玛丽·贝克·艾迪的故事

2867
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,310
I came across the story of Mark Twain and Mary Baker Eddy.

2868
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:19,760
我花费十年的时间断断续续地撰写剧本

2869
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:19,760
I spent ten years writing the screenplay on and off.

2870
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,860
当剧本终于接近完成的时候

2871
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,860
When I got close to finishing the script,

2872
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,140
我感觉我需要弄懂这个

2873
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,140
I felt I needed to understand the character

2874
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,650
我将在自己的电影里扮演的角色

2875
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,650
I was going to play in my movie.

2876
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,350
我开始写一个独角戏

2877
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,350
I started writing a one-man play.

2878
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,480
我扮演马克·吐温这个角色

2879
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,480
I play the character of Mark Twain,

2880
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,990
可以说，他是美国最伟大的作家

2881
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,990
who was arguably America’s greatest writer.

2882
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,090
他也是第一个单口喜剧演员

2883
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,090
He was also the first stand-up comedian.

2884
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,150
我会说牛语

2885
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,150
I speak cow.

2886
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,620
创作一部好电影很难

2887
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,620
It’s very hard to write a good movie,

2888
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,790
而我想创作一部伟大的电影

2889
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,790
and I’ve been trying to write a great movie.

2890
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,220
呃，我甚至可能... 我甚至可能比那更进一步

2891
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,220
Uh, I might even... I might even go further than that,

2892
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:16,380
我想写一部经典之作

2893
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:16,380
say I’m trying to write a classic.

2894
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,740
杰克：为了让吐温在舞台上活过来

2895
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,740
JACK: In order to bring Twain to life onstage,

2896
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,430
我需要钱。很多很多钱

2897
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,430
I needed money and a lot of it.

2898
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,950
在那时，我因离婚而深陷债务

2899
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,950
And at the time, I was in a lot of debt from the divorce,

2900
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,080
经济也已经崩溃

2901
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,080
and the economy had crashed.

2902
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,730
我拥有的唯一有价值的东西

2903
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,730
The only thing I had of significant value

2904
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,430
是我在新墨西哥州积累的六千英亩土地

2905
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,430
was the 6,000 acres of land I’d accumulated in New Mexico,

2906
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:37,650
梦想有一天，我能在这里建造一个艺术家社区

2907
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:37,650
with the dream of one day building an artist community.

2908
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,540
它将成为我的遗产

2909
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,540
It was going to be my legacy

2910
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,660
传给我的孩子，给我孩子的孩子

2911
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,660
that I passed on to my children and their children.

2912
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,920
我&梅赛德斯

2913
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,210
我做出了不可能的选择

2914
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,210
I made the impossible choice

2915
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,080
决定卖掉我视为珍宝的土地

2916
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,080
to sell the land that was so dear to me

2917
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,080
为了付清我的债务

2918
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,080
in order to pay off my debts

2919
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:55,330
为了追求我注定要扮演的角色——我对此坚信不疑

2920
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:55,330
and pursue the role I believed I was destined to play.

2921
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,380
方（扮演吐温）：当一个人抓着尾巴提起一只猫，

01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,380
VAL (as Twain): If a man picks up a cat

2923
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,370
提起一只猫，他会学到一堂有关人生的课程

2924
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,370
by the tail, he learns something about life

2925
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:06,170
这堂课不可能以其他任何方法获得

2926
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:06,170
that he cannot learn in any other way.

2927
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:12,560
人类是唯一会脸红的动物

2928
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:12,560
Man is the only animal that blushes,

2929
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,910
也是唯一需要这样做的

2930
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,910
or needs to.

2931
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:21,790
文明是不必要的必需品的无限增殖

2932
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:21,790
Civilization is the limitless multiplication of unnecessary necessities.

2933
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:27,720
如果你需要为美国的故事选一位讲述者

2934
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:27,720
If you had to pick a narrator for the story of America,

2935
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,760
你不可能选出...

2936
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,760
you can’t name...

2937
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:35,570
更合适的人选，因为...

2938
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:35,570
a more qualified man, because...

2939
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,990
他真的懂得一切

2940
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,990
he really understood everything.

2941
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,870
如果你在后排听不清我说话

2942
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,870

in about three years of doing the play,

3017
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,120
因此，我正在巡演的旅途中

3018
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,120

因为我离家太远，四处奔走，以此还清债务

3048
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:41,470
because I was away too long touring to pay my debts

3049
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,140

3057
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,990

这也是我在人世受苦的最后一年

What are the words that heal a broken heart?

3073
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:50,880
我知道这不是世界上最重要的问题

3074
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:50,880
I know that’s not the most important question in the world,

3075

3079
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,770
我失去了我的声音

3080
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,770
when I lost my voice.

3081
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:43,000
我推迟了演出，以为这就是一两个月的事儿

3082
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:43,000
I postponed the show for what I thought would be a month or two.

3083
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,740
我的声音没有好转

3084
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,740
My voice didn’t get better.

3085
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:49,720
它每况愈下，有一天我开始咳血

3086
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:49,720
It got worse, and one day I started coughing up blood

3087
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:51,460
被紧急送往医院

3088
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:51,460
and was rushed to the hospital.

3089
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:58,120
通过治疗和祈祷，我缓慢地恢复了

3090
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:58,120
Through treatment and prayer, I slowly recovered,

3091
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:01,070
但我能多大程度地恢复我的声音仍是未知数。

3092
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:01,070
but how much I would regain my voice remained unknown.

3093
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:06,570
我的职业生涯或将终结，我与这个可能性殊死搏斗

3094
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:06,570
I wrestled with the possibility of my career being over,

3095
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,500
坠入黑暗

3096
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,500
and fell into darkness.

3097
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:16,410
如果天堂真的存在，当你抵达云端大门的时候

3098
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:16,410
If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say

3099
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,870
你希望听见上帝说什么？

3100
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,870
when you arrive at the pearly gates?

3101
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:22,730
我曾经做过这样一个梦

3102
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:22,730
Well, I had this dream once.

3103
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,280
梦里，呃...

3104
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,280
And, uh...

3105
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,370
这件事发生了

3106
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,370
this happened.

3107
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:37,040
她张开应该是双臂的存在

3108
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:37,040
And she opened what would be her arms,

3109
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,560
将我紧紧包围，对我说："我爱你"

3110
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,560
that feeling, and enveloped me and said, "I love you."

3111
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:58,150
杰克：在医院里，我重新开始画画

3112
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:58,150
JACK: In the hospital, I began to paint again.

3113
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,920
就像我们小时候做的那样

3114
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,920
The way we did when we were kids.

3115
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,390
等我终于出院，我把自己扔进艺术创作的世界

3116
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,390
When I finally got out, I threw myself into making art.

3117
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:20,500
我找到一个大到足够容纳我的想法的工作室

3118
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:20,500
I found a studio big enough for my ideas.

3119
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:26,740
那个工作室已经成为一处圣地

3120
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:26,740
That studio has become a sacred space

3121
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,820
艺术家们聚集于此，相互合作

3122
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,820
where artists gather and collaborate...

3123
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:34,000
帮助社区中的新一代艺术家成长

3124
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:34,000
and help the next generation of artists in our community grow.

3125
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,460
在地球上，天堂和地狱的距离

3126
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,460
Here on Earth, the distance between heaven and hell

3127
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,970
就是信仰与怀疑的区别

3128
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,970
is the difference between faith and doubt.

3129
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,570
比方说，我毫不怀疑，我的疾病赶走了很多

3130
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,570
I have no doubt, for example, my recent illness shut down

3131
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:52,030
根本不算机会的专业机会

3132
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:52,030
professional opportunities that were not opportunities at all.

3133
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,620
痊愈并非诞生自虚荣

3134
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,620
Healing is not born of vanity.

3135
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:57,400
而是生于诚实

3136
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:57,400
It is born of honesty.

3137
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,360
诚实生于纯粹的爱

3138
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,360
Honesty is born of pure love.

3139
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,860
而爱是最神圣的医者

3140
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,860
And love is the most divine healer,

3141
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:08,080
它最为甜美、最为圣洁、也最有效力

3142
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:08,080
the sweetest, holiest and most effective.

3143
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:14,560
方：我们要去马里布

3144
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:14,560
VAL: So we’re going out to Malibu

3145
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:18,770
因为我可爱的小教堂

3146
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:18,770
because of my wonderful little church,

3147
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:23,340
还有教会的成员都在那里，我非常爱他们

3148
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:23,340
and my members there, I love them very much.

3149
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:29,140
我研究过所有主要宗教

3150
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:29,140
I’ve studied all the major religions.

3151
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,630
我一直对宗教感兴趣

3152
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,630
I’ve always been interested in religions,

3153
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:33,650
而且

3154
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:33,650
and

3155
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:35,790
当我遇到某人的时候

3156
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:35,790
often when I meet someone,

3157
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,290
我最后经常在聊他们的信仰

3158
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,290
I’ll end up talking about their faith.

3159
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:39,800
我会问他们

3160
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:39,800
I’ll ask them.

3161
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:51,310
杰克：你还好吗？

3162
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:51,310
JACK: You okay?

3163
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,510
- 我忍不住啊              - 这不好玩

3164
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,510
- I can’t help it. - That’s not funny.

3165
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:01,760
我是个混球

3166
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:01,760
I’m a bastard.

3167
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,460
- 不好玩                   - 而我爱你

3168
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,460
- Not funny. - And I love you.

3169
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:06,960
不好玩

3170
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:06,960
Not funny.

3171
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,300
那非常、非常好玩

3172
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,300
It’s very, very funny.

3173
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,570
马里布，六英里

3174
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,570
Malibu, six miles.

3175
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,350
看看那片海

3176
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,350
Oh, look at the ocean.

3177
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:30,610
想象一下，要是我参加教堂礼拜

3178
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:30,610
What would happen if I went into this church service

3179
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:35,140
出来的时候能正常说话了？

3180
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:35,140
and I came out speaking perfectly well?

3181
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,690
女声：感恩归于上帝

3182
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,690
WOMAN (over computer): Thanks be to God

3183
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,790
他通过我们的主耶稣将荣耀降给我们

3184
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,790
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

3185
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:47,780
我们的主人完备地、终极地展示了神圣的科学。

3186
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:47,780
Our master fully and finally demonstrated divine science

3187
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,550
他的荣耀超乎死亡和坟墓

3188
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,550
in his victory over death and the grave.

3189
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,930
这对我是很好的一课

3190
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,930
It’s a very good lesson for me to study

3191
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,990
有关超乎坟墓的荣耀

3192
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,990
about victory over the grave.

3193
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,200
我觉得我们还有时间再讲一个故事，对不对？

3194
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,200
(as Twain): I think we got time for one more story, don’t we?

3195
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:13,730
我要再给你们讲一个故事

3196
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:13,730
I’m gonna tell you one more story.

3197
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,500
这是我最谦卑的姿态了

3198
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,500
This is as humble as I’m willing to get.

3199
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:29,880
杰克：我一直想讲一个有关表演的故事

3200
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:29,880
JACK: I’ve wanted to tell a story about acting

3201
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,420
已经想了很久很久

3202
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,420
for a very long time.

3203
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,250
有关真相

3204
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,250
About truth.

3205
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:36,910
有关幻象

3206
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:36,910
And illusion.

3207
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,110
我的布道有关真相和幻象

3208
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,110
VAL (as Twain): My sermon’s gonna be about truth and illusion.

3209
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:45,620
真相是，为了寻得每一个角色

3210
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:45,620
JACK: The truth is, in order to find each character,

3211
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:48,450
我把我的一部分放到他们里面

3212
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:48,450
I’ve had to put a little bit of me in them

3213
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,830
寻见他们的一部分，放到我的里面

3214
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,830
and find a little bit of them in me.

3215
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:55,660
我在幻象里生活的时间

3216
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:55,660
I’ve lived in the illusion

3217
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:58,260
几乎与我在幻象外生活得一样久

3218
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:58,260
almost as much as I’ve lived outside of it.

3219
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,140
我的行为曾经很糟糕

3220
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,140
I have behaved poorly.

3221
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,970
我曾经表现得很勇敢

3222
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,970
I have behaved bravely.

3223
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:07,050
对某些人来说，我的行为曾经稀奇古怪

3224
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:07,050
I have behaved bizarrely, to some.

3225
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:10,500
我不否认任何事，也不后悔任何事

3226
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:10,500
I deny none of this and have no regrets

3227
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,780
因为我失去也找回我的许多部分——而此前，我从不知道他们存在

3228
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,780
because I’ve lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed.

3229
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:17,420
我是被祝福的

3230
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:17,420
And I am blessed.

3231
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:39,130
开拍

3232
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:39,130
MAN: Action.

3233
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:44,820
就当是我在测试边界

3234
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:44,820
Let’s just say I was testing the bounds of reality.

3235
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:48,880
就这样，我只是好奇

3236
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:48,880
That’s all. I was curious.

3237
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:52,780
就像埃里克·冯·施特罗海姆在电影里一样

3238
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:52,780
Like Erich von Stroheim in the movies.

3239
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:55,470
让你爱恨交加的男人

3240
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:55,470
The man you love to hate.

3241
01:43:56,740 --> 01:44:01,370
这是在讽刺，就像勇气想放声大笑一样

3242
01:43:56,740 --> 01:44:01,370
It’s meant to be ironic, like courage wants to laugh.

3243
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:06,230
但本质上，这是一个愚蠢的局面

3244
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:06,230
But essentially, it’s a stupid situation.

3245
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:09,710
我走上舞台，为人们嚎哭、大叫

3246
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:09,710
I go out onstage and howl for people.

3247
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:14,220
哦，复仇！

3248
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:14,220
O, vengeance!

3249
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,720
我真是个混球！

3250
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,720
What an ass am I.

3251
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:26,340
在我身上，人们看到的都是他们想看见的东西

3252
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:26,340
In me, they see exactly what they want to see.

3253
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,130
有人说是蜥蜴王

3254
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,130
Some say a lizard king,

3255
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,620
管他是什么意思

3256
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,620
whatever that means.

3257
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:34,330
有人说是黑色的皮衣恶魔——也管他是什么意思

3258
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:34,330
Some black-clad leather demon, whatever that means.

3259
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:41,170
我把我自己看作...

3260
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:41,170
But really, I see myself as a...

3261
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,500
一个敏感而聪明的人类

3262
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,500
sensitive, intelligent human being...

3263
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:48,540
却拥有小丑的灵魂

3264
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:48,540
but with the soul of a clown.

3265
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:53,370
这是我要传讲的

3266
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:53,370
(as Twain): Here’s what I preach.

3267
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:57,080
做好你喜欢做的事...

3268
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:57,080
Do what you love to do so well...

3269
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,500
我太激动了，这让我很兴奋

3270
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,500
I’m thrilled. It excites me.

3271
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,870
这就是为什么在这儿工作这么刺激

3272
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,870
That’s why working here is so stimulating.

3273
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,380
有些人甚至甘愿花费他们的工资来见你

3274
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,380
that someone will pay you wages for it.

3275
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:10,590
有时候，上帝来的是如此迅速

3276
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:10,590
And then sometimes there is God so quickly.

3277
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,660
我是美国的意识吗？

3278
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,660
Am I the conscience of America?

3279
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:16,350
不，我把这个问题留给我的上级领导

3280
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:16,350
No, I leave that to my betters.

3281
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,640
也许我是讲述者

3282
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,640
Perhaps I am the narrator.

3283
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,070
是的，就是这样

3284
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,070
Yes, that’s it.

3285
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:26,140
你需要的只有无知和自信

3286
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:26,140
All you need is ignorance and confidence,

3287
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:28,300
然后，成功触手可及

3288
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:28,300
and success is sure

3289
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:32,650
不过，不要让你的幻象破灭

3290
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:32,650
Don’t let go of your illusions though.

3291
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:35,530
它们消失以后，或许你依然存在

3292
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:35,530
When they are gone, you may still exist,

3293
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,980
却不再活着

3294
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,980
