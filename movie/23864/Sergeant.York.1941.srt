1
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,645
"And he spake this parable
unto them saying,

2
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,709
"What man of you having a hundred sheep,

3
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,220
"if you lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety-nine, and..."

4
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,656
"Doth not leave the ninety-nine
in the wilderness,

5
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,563
"and go after that which was lost, until..."

6
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,937
"Until he find it."

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,101
"And when he hath found it, he layeth it,

8
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,145
"on his shoulder and rejoiceth.

9
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,941
"And when he cometh..."

10
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,444
All right, Zeke, sit yourself down.

11
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,386
"And when he cometh home
he calleth together his friends

12
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,945
"and neighbors saying..."

13
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,891
"He calleth to his friends and neighbors,

14
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,464
"saying unto them, 'Rejoice with me,

15
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,399
"'for I have found my sheep
which were lost."'

16
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,669
I recollect the time Sam Harkness
lost his old sow.

17
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,308
He come out one morning,

18
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,141
the pen be busted down,
the sow was gone.

19
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,580
Sam lit out after it to find it.

20
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,381
He had six or seven other pigs
that didn't run off.

21
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,256
But did Sam get down
on his marrowbones,

22
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,690
and thank the good Lord for that?

23
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,195
No, siree, not Sam.

24
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,857
He hunted high and low for that old...

25
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,098
As I was saying,

26
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,040
he hunted high and low for that old sow.

27
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,274
About all he...

28
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,590
About all he done that summer
was hunt for that sow.

29
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,366
Wouldn't even stop...

30
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,463
Wouldn't even stop hunting
when winter come.

31
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,838
And sure enough, one night,
when he was plowing home...

32
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,005
One night, when he was plowing home
through the snow,

33
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,673
he seen something move in the shadows.

34
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,751
Sam... Sam's right scared.

35
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,480
Figures maybe it's a bear.

36
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,289
Then the...

37
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,024
Then the...

38
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,993
Then the bear grunts
and it ain't no bear at all.

39
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,529
It's the sow!

40
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,192
Well, Sam was fitting to be tied.

41
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,359
The rejoicingest man you ever seen.

42
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:07,065
Ten times as rejoiceful for the lost one
as for 'em that stayed in the fold.

43
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,765
Now this here...

44
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,000
Now this here...

45
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,236
Now this here is the point!

46
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,752
It appears to me that
the devil be a-knocking at the

47
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
door of the house of worship.

48
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,598
If there's any of you
want to go get him, you're...

49
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,464
You'll be free to go.

50
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,564
'Cause the meeting's over.

51
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,934
Lookee here, Pastor Pile.

52
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,276
Alvin York done shot his initials
in this tree.

53
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,213
"A-Y," plain as day.

54
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,250
It was Alvin York, Ike Botkin
and Buck Lipscomb in their liquor.

55
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,480
Who was you saying it was?

56
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,451
Who was you saying it was?

57
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,992
-It was Alvin, Mrs. York.
-How be you know it?

58
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,999
It wasn't Alvin, Mother York,
it was the liquor.

59
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,973
Mighty good shooting
for a man in his liquor.

60
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,006
Ain't it?

61
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,462
Say, let's do it again.

62
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,773
-Howdy, boys!
-Howdy!

63
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,201
-Howdy, Pastor.
-Howdy, Luke.

64
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,406
-We were looking for you Saturday.
-Couldn't get here no more than fly.

65
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,382
Roads are getting soggier and soggier
between here and Rugby.

66
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,850
-Is that so?
-Water is so deep

67
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,049
in some of 'em creek beds,
had to use old Betsy's belly for a boat.

68
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,147
How are you, Zeke?

69
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,284
I reckon you could have got here quicker
if you had carried Betsy.

70
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,625
Yeah, wished I could get me another mule
like old Flora.

71
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,597
They ain't turning out mules
like they used to.

72
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,860
No, sir!

73
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,834
Hey, what you got there, young fellow?

74
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,133
The very latest thing in ladies' hats,
the cloche model.

75
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,174
Women folks around here
wear split bonnets.

76
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,868
The young ones goes bareheaded.

77
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,843
Maybe so, but in modern merchandising,

78
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,607
the storekeeper endeavors
to create a demand.

79
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,876
Now in this line of ladies' bloomers,

80
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,886
very moderately priced,
has the finest elastic in the waistband,

81
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,781
also in the knees.

82
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,154
No amount of washing
will make it lose its snap.

83
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,660
-Your first trip in these parts, ain't it?
-Yes.

84
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,787
And we have them in three lovely colors.

85
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,300
Which we absolutely guarantee
will not fade or shrink.

86
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,525
Plenty of room in the seat, too.

87
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,232
I can tell you these garments
are mighty popular with the ladies.

88
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,771
-You can, huh?
-Yes.

89
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,309
Well, folks hereabouts wouldn't know
what 'em things is for.

90
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,401
-Lem?
-Yeah.

91
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,742
-Lem, here's your Nashville paper.
-Well, thank you, Pastor.

92
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,339
I got letters here for Tom Carver
and Ed Watson.

93
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,145
Both back tax bills, I reckon.

94
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,449
-What does it say, Lem?
-Well...

95
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,052
They're a-telling, Cordell Hull
are speechmaking over in Jimtown.

96
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,231
Appears he's out running
for Congress again.

97
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,461
-It says...
-I mind when Cord Hull

98
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,561
wasn't knee high to a toad frog,

99
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,572
and running around in his shirttail.

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,132
Just goes to show you what
a fellow can do if he gets book learning.

101
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,872
That paper is four days old,
I read it over at Nashville.

102
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,073
Yep. It took Luke three days
of mule-paddling

103
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,775
to bring the mail from Rugby.

104
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,580
I can believe that,
after driving over here from Jamestown.

105
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,915
Jimtown.

106
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,613
-I thought it was Jamestown.
-It are.

107
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,461
Well, anyway, since driving over here,

108
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,832
what I'd like to know is,
how do you fellows get into this valley?

109
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,868
We were born here.

110
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,406
Now look, Mr. Pile,

111
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,136
I'd like to sell you some of these garments

112
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,235
before the price goes up
on account of the war.

113
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,575
What war?

114
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,075
Why, the... The war in Europe.

115
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,546
Oh, that war.

116
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,191
Yes, certainly.

117
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,653
Look likes the Germans
might get into Paris, don't you think?

118
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,756
Well, we ain't done
much thinking on it, mister.

119
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,630
It ain't in our corner, nohow.

120
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,499
If you're hankering for trouble,

121
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,765
it ain't scarce
right here in these mountains.

122
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,399
Oh, I ain't looking for any trouble.

123
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,974
Yep, fighting could have been
mighty plentiful

124
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,070
down at the meeting house last night.
Did you hear?

125
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,639
Alvin York and two other fellows
done busted up the meeting.

126
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,653
That ain't a smithereen
to what he done in Jimtown.

127
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,053
-Nigh split the jail, he did.
-No...

128
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,216
Raised such a rumpus
they had to turn him loose.

129
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,350
Do tell.

130
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,792
Old man Jarvis up Bear Creek way

131
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,126
told me he seen the three of 'em
riding their mules,

132
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,530
hell-bent for election,
toward the Kentucky border.

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,090
I reckon their liquor was getting low

134
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,035
and they wanted to get there
before they sobered up.

135
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,603
Howdy, Mrs. York.

136
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,147
-Howdy, Luke.
-Howdy, Mother York.

137
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,647
-Tolerable, Pastor.
-What can I do for you today?

138
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,414
Could I be getting a can of baking powder
and a...

139
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,351
-Poke of salt?
-Sure thing.

140
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:14,400
I ain't having but five eggs
and they're kind of puny.

141
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,633
Oh, eggs are eggs, I reckon.

142
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,078
I was plumb out of salt.

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,913
Don't be taking it hard, Mother York,
what you just heard.

144
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,912
I ain't taking nothing hard, Pastor.

145
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,255
And I ain't making excuses
for Alvin to nobody.

146
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,988
Of course you ain't,
and I ain't asking you to.

147
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,123
-I'm right proud of Alvin.
-Got a right to be.

148
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,969
Works hard, Alvin does.

149
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,173
Patching and scratching that poor land.

150
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,603
It's mighty hard work,
getting corn out of rocks.

151
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,543
-Indeed it is.
-Who's to blame him

152
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,975
if he busts loose now and again?

153
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,820
Nobody, Mother York, nary a soul.

154
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,985
Of course, I ain't for Alvin

155
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,357
doing like he does.

156
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,260
A little religion wouldn't do him no hurt.

157
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,969
No, it wouldn't.

158
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:25,375
Pastor, I wouldn't be against
your talking to Alvin.

159
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,573
You reckon it'd do any good?

160
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,051
Well, it wouldn't do no harm.

161
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,454
I'd be riding up and having a talk with him.

162
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,848
I'm thanking you, Pastor.

163
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,135
-George.
-Yes, Ma?

164
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,143
I reckon I know where your brother's at.

165
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,681
He's up at the Kentucky border.

166
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,852
-Go fetch him.
-Yessum.

167
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,334
Better be taking a piece of corn
for your supper, Son.

168
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,630
Yessum.

169
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,514
-Hiya, Marter.
-Hiya, Alvin.

170
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,820
-Mart, we wants to get us a bottle.
-Now look here, Alvin.

171
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,391
You know, I know and so do the Sheriff.
You're from over here in Tennessee.

172
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,957
And I can't sell you no liquor
less you gets over yonder in Kentucky.

173
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,939
Marter, you are the legalest fellow in
these here parts, if you ain't nothing else.

174
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,406
You gotta be, in this business.

175
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,342
Maybe our credit ain't no good
in Tennessee.

176
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,369
Bet it ain't no better in Kentuck.

177
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,639
What you be having, Alvin?

178
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,208
You got any corn without no lye in it?

179
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,254
No poison oak leaves in it, either.

180
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,449
Ain't no lye in this liquor.

181
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,823
Plumb hollow I am,
like an old, burnt-out stump.

182
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,420
Me, too.

183
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,463
What are we drinking to, Alvin?

184
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,795
What'll we drink to, Ike?

185
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,597
Why, I reckon we drunk
to pretty near everything there is.

186
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,543
-I can't think of nothing new.
-Me neither.

187
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,913
Reckon we better begin all over?

188
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,014
If we can't drink to something,

189
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,346
why don't we drink against something?

190
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,219
Against something? Against what?

191
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,727
Oh, against something
or somebody we're against.

192
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,855
I ain't against nobody or nothing.
Except getting sober.

193
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,031
We'll drink against that.

194
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,501
You... You'll be a-killing
two birds with one stone.

195
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,596
-Come on. Sure.
-Ain't never gonna get sober.

196
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,083
Never gonna get...

197
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,887
Well, I'll be blowed.

198
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,190
What are you doing here, George?

199
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,857
Young'uns like you ain't got no business
in a place like this here, nohow.

200
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,231
-Now just you skedaddle.
-Ma wants you home.

201
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,367
-Now look here, George...
-Ma wants you.

202
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,001
-Shucks, son of a gun...
-Well,

203
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,839
reckon I better go. I'll be seeing you.

204
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,279
His ma wants him.

205
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,156
Get up.

206
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,130
Here, here. Quit that.

207
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,292
Hold your horses, Marter.

208
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,612
Here we go.

209
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,716
Here we go again.

210
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,887
I'm still a-coming.

211
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,159
Say when you got enough.

212
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,788
Say it.

213
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,121
Enough, enough.

214
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,403
Ma wants you, Alvin.

215
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,044
Ma wants you.

216
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,374
Coming, George.

217
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,196
-I'll be seeing you.
-So long, Al.

218
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,345
Here he is, Ma.

219
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,723
It took a heap of looking,
but he come easy.

220
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,127
-Fetch me a pail of water, George.
-Yessum.

221
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,766
Breakfast's ready, now it is.
Better be getting at it.

222
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,502
South field needs a-plowing.

223
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,021
The Lord bless these victuals we done got

224
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,694
and help us to be
beholding to nobody. Amen.

225
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,837
I reckon you'll want some salt
on your pone.

226
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,081
Whoa, Fred.

227
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,493
Giddap, Noah.

228
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:36,992
Whoa.

229
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,132
-Howdy, Pastor.
-Howdy, Alvin.

230
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,506
I've been kind of expecting you.

231
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,645
I'm right sorry about the other night, I...

232
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,680
I reckon I done the wrong thing.

233
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,682
See that rock, Alvin?

234
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,352
You've been plowing around that rock
a heap of years.

235
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,054
Sure have.

236
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,850
Did you ever think when you start plowing
your furrows crooked,

237
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,795
it's mighty hard to get 'em straight again.

238
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,866
-I never thought on it much.
-It's that a-way, I reckon,

239
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,437
with other things besides plowing.

240
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,837
Satan's got you by the shirttail, Alvin.

241
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,044
Sure has. Giddap, Noah.

242
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,512
He's gonna yank you straight down to hell.

243
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,980
You are plum right, Pastor.

244
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,847
You gotta make him let loose of you
before it's too late.

245
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,283
I sure wish I know'd how.

246
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,651
Wrestle him, Alvin,
wrestle him like you would a bear.

247
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,180
I done wrestled him, Pastor, but...
Whoa, whoa there, Noah.

248
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,291
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, Noah.

249
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,960
But old Satan, he hangs on tight.

250
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,794
You and the Lord could throw him, Alvin.

251
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,699
Why, twixt the two of you,
you'd have old Satan down in a jiffy.

252
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,999
Why, I sure wish the Lord would throw in.

253
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,005
He will, if you ask him.

254
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,767
Oh, I done prayed, Pastor,
till I was black in the face.

255
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:59,211
-But it wasn't no use.
-It ain't only praying, Alvin, it's believing.

256
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,911
Now, you see here.

257
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,989
Take a look at the old oak yonder.
Looks mighty strong.

258
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,925
Been standing there since your pa
was a boy a-plowing in the same field.

259
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,792
Looks like it could go right on standing
all by itself, don't it?

260
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,921
Yep.

261
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,058
Just a-resting itself
and feeding on the earth.

262
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,929
Well, it can't. It can't stand there

263
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,201
without there's a lot of deep roots
a-holding it up.

264
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,641
Can't see the roots,
but they're there just the same.

265
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,506
It appears to me it's been planned
a fellow's got to have his roots

266
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,014
in something outside his own self.

267
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,684
I reckon I ain't found no roots
what'll hold me up, when...

268
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,445
When I'm hell-bent to fall.

269
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,888
And then take the animals in the woods.

270
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,357
Squirrels'd go mighty hungry

271
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,054
if nothing made 'em store up nuts
for the wintertime.

272
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,221
-Sure would.
-How do you reckon

273
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,131
birds get to fly north in the summer
if there ain't something a-guiding 'em?

274
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,170
A bird ain't got no way of telling
north from south.

275
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,034
And then there's the bees.

276
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,573
Bees'd sure be in a fix
if they wasn't beholding to something

277
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,235
to show 'em how to get back to the hives.

278
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,405
Well, I ain't no bird and I ain't no squirrel.

279
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,575
-And I sure ain't no bee.
-Well, that's right, Alvin.

280
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,451
The way I figure, there ain't no use for a
fellow going out looking for religion. It's...

281
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,217
Well, it's just gotta come to a fellow.

282
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,417
It'll come, my boy. You'll see.

283
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,961
Maybe slow, like the way daylight comes.

284
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,088
And maybe in a flash,
like a bolt of lightning.

285
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,631
-When?
-When you ain't even expecting it.

286
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,435
Well, I hope so.

287
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,005
Giddap, Noah. I'll be seeing you.

288
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,864
Get after him, now.

289
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,809
Tracks are mighty fresh.
Less than an hour old.

290
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,175
-Reckon it's a red fox?
-Might be red and might be gray.

291
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,645
It's making a big circle.

292
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,841
Can't tell about his course
till he gets out on the flat.

293
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,841
They took to the hill there.
Yeah, that-a-way.

294
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,844
What's the matter, Alvin?

295
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,353
Howdy.

296
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,496
-You're Alvin York, ain't you?
-Yes.

297
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,156
Let's get going, Alvin.

298
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:08,104
I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
Where you been keeping yourself?

299
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,970
-Hereabouts.
-What's ailing you?

300
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,906
Are you coming or ain't you?

301
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,377
You better go get that fox, George.

302
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,243
You're just tetched.

303
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,306
How's your ma?

304
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,312
I asked you how your ma was.

305
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,486
Tolerable.

306
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,354
I figured it was you out a-hunting.

307
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,987
No mistaking the voices
of 'em hound dogs.

308
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,963
One's a-having a hook to the end of its bay

309
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,159
you could be hanging a bucket on.

310
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:41,194
The other's a croak, just like a frog,
about moonrise.

311
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,942
-What...
-You ain't Gracie Williams, are you?

312
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,968
Well, I ain't nobody but.

313
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,304
Why, you was only just...

314
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,250
You sure growed up all of a sudden like...

315
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,021
Reckon I have.

316
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,025
Sounds as if they've run that fox
to ground.

317
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,797
I said 'em hound dogs
run the fox to ground.

318
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,258
You better be getting along.

319
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,869
Reckon I had.

320
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,035
-I'll be seeing you.
-Hoping.

321
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,006
Ma.

322
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,178
Yeah?

323
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,887
When you and Pa got hitched,
what did Pa have to set up with?

324
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,926
Well, your pa had this here farm

325
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:14,393
and a mule and $5, no $6.

326
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,798
What did Grandpa have?

327
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,165
Your grandpa had this here farm,
a pair of horses.

328
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,840
The mare was in foal.

329
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,340
I reckon I wouldn't, George.

330
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,813
Ma.

331
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,490
It's sure ripped down here.
You reckon you can fix it?

332
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,429
I reckon. Come over here, Alvin.

333
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,732
Bend over.

334
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,603
You're a-figuring on setting up,
ain't you, Son?

335
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,670
-Yessum.
-Getting married?

336
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,770
-Who's it gonna be?
-Gracie Williams.

337
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,807
Gracie Williams?

338
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,246
Asked her yet?

339
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,322
No, I ain't.

340
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,823
What's the matter?

341
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,927
I ain't said nothing.

342
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,531
Reckon that'll hold.

343
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,963
Reckon it better.

344
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,651
Hold it thataway, Zeb.

345
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:49,660
Thinking on going to that there shindig
next Saturday night, Miss Gracie?

346
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,122
-I ain't been asked.
-Well...

347
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,465
You've been asked now.

348
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,734
-I can't say, Zeb. I have to think it over.
-Well, I don't...

349
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,035
Joshua, 14, verse 9...

350
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,037
You'd be a-coming if you wanted to,
Miss Gracie.

351
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,605
Maybe I could and maybe I couldn't.

352
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,782
Why, it's Alvin York.

353
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,253
-Howdy, Miss Gracie.
-Howdy, Alvin.

354
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,020
-You know Zeb Andrews, ain't you?
-Howdy.

355
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,484
Knitting, Zeb?

356
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,929
He was just a-helping me.

357
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,199
I wasn't expecting you
to be a-calling so soon.

358
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,567
Well, I said I'd be seeing you.

359
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,340
Last time I seen Alvin
he was chasing a fox.

360
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,737
He stopped here for a spell to

361
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,669
kind of catch his breath.

362
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,174
-Did you kill that fox, Alvin?
-I sure did.

363
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,152
-We run over there...
-Was that a gray fox or a red?

364
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,910
Red. Just to the side of that...

365
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,981
Why, a red fox skin ain't worth nothing
this time of the year.

366
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,923
That little hollow...

367
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,427
This one was.

368
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:03,493
"Asa begat Joshiat
and Joshiat begat Joshua."

369
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,298
It's just Uncle Lige talking to himself.

370
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,070
Zeb here was telling me there's gonna be
a dance over to Thomson's Mill.

371
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,199
Yeah, I hear that...

372
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,676
Ed Morgan's gonna do the fiddling.

373
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,902
I was figuring that...

374
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,971
Just about the best fiddler
in these here parts, he is.

375
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,449
-He ain't.
-If he ain't, who'd be?

376
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,453
-Tod Haskins.
-He can't hold a candle to Ed.

377
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,949
-You're a-thinking.
-I'm a-knowing.

378
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,156
-Oh, you are, are you?
-Now, now, now. Hush up, you two.

379
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,719
There ain't no call
for fussing over a fiddler.

380
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,664
-We weren't a-fussing. I was telling him...
-Well, I'm a-telling you...

381
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:40,227
The way I figure, Ed's better at the jigging
and Tod can sure fiddle a square.

382
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,901
"It biteth like a serpent,
and stingeth like an adder."

383
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,213
Uncle Lige there was a-telling me
that corn's right good this harvest.

384
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,442
How's the crops up your way, Alvin?

385
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,418
We figure to get about
20 bushel to the acre.

386
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,386
We're gonna get about 60.

387
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,850
Well, there's a heap of difference

388
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,618
twixt farming the bottomland and the top.

389
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,785
-Well, there sure is.
-I reckon...

390
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,796
You know, I don't see how you get
five bushels off of that there land of yours.

391
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,958
Now look here, Zeb Andrews...

392
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,966
Miss... Miss Gracie,

393
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,040
I'd sure be much obliged
if I could have a cup of water.

394
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,633
I got some nipping cider.

395
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,908
-Well, that'd go mighty good.
-I'll be getting it.

396
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,548
"And the lion shall lie down
with the lamb."

397
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,605
Here's your cider. It's coming from the...

398
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,247
Where's Zeb?

399
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,382
-What's he...
-I reckon he lit out.

400
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,582
Well, isn't he be coming back?

401
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,190
No, ma'am, he ain't.

402
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,625
-That strikes me mighty queer.
-Yessum.

403
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,699
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

404
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,664
"do it with thy might."

405
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,710
Alvin, you...

406
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,037
You was fighting.

407
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,278
-It weren't much.
-Alvin York...

408
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,876
You ain't a-fitting to come a-visiting a girl.

409
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,716
He ain't got no business
around here anyhow.

410
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,847
As much business as you have, Alvin York.

411
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,823
-No, he ain't.
-Well, why ain't he?

412
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,053
-Well, he ain't because...
-Because, why?

413
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,359
Because...
Because I'm a-going to marry you.

414
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,223
-You what?
-I'm a-going to marry you.

415
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,971
Now, now, now, Alvin, you stop that.
Don't you be saying things like that.

416
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,837
-Don't you be saying 'em.
-Well, I have.

417
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,274
It ain't...

418
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,478
-Oh, you are, are you?
-Yessum.

419
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,241
Well, you can't...

420
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,440
-Well, your mother told me about it.
-That's what I'm a-doing.

421
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,312
Well, I never... Lookee here...

422
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,348
I wouldn't have you on a Christmas tree,
Alvin York.

423
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,959
Fine husband you'd make.

424
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,462
I allow Zeb Andrews would make
a better one?

425
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,930
Oh, how should I know? Maybe he would.

426
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,698
Zeb Andrews got a piece of bottomland,
that's it, ain't it?

427
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,671
You thinking that's it, aren't you?

428
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,644
Folks say you're no good
except for fighting and hell raising

429
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,044
and I'm thinking they're plumb right.

430
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,343
If I had a piece of bottomland,

431
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,441
I'd guess it'd make a heap of difference,
wouldn't it?

432
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,611
-A piece of bottomland!
-Well, I can get some.

433
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,678
Well, go and get it. I ain't a-caring.

434
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,214
There ain't nothing I can't get
if I set my mind to it.

435
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,817
You don't think much of yourself, do you?

436
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,795
Yes, I do.

437
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,456
Amen.

438
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,907
That there's bottomland soil, ain't it?

439
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,448
Queer how the folks
that lives on the bottom

440
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,809
looks down on the folks on top.

441
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,622
It was always that way.

442
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,190
Ain't no changing it.

443
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,197
Well, I'm a-gonna change it.

444
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,958
I'm a-gonna get us a piece of bottomland.

445
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,399
Your pa set out to get hisself
a piece of bottomland once.

446
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,031
Nary a man ever tried harder.

447
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,073
Liked to kill hisself trying.

448
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,216
It was a long time before he gave up,

449
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,515
but he had to in the end.

450
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,624
Well, I ain't a-setting myself up
as a better man than Pa.

451
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,957
I reckon I ain't half as good,

452
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,231
but I'm a-knowing where there's
a piece of bottomland to be had

453
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,264
and I'm a-gonna get it.

454
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,197
Maybe you will.

455
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,410
How old you say this here mule be?

456
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,814
-Nine year, but Abraham's sound.
-Yes, he are.

457
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,120
He's kind of pussle-gutted,
it appears to me.

458
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,091
Nary a bit.
He's just mighty well fed, that's all.

459
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,421
Well...

460
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,991
I reckon I might allow you $30 on him.

461
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,623
-$30?
-Yeah.

462
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,224
-You say $30?
-Yeah.

463
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,736
Well, he's worth $40 if he's worth a cent.

464
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,601
Then he ain't worth a cent.

465
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,367
-What's all this here you got?
-Well, there's two dozen pullets.

466
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,769
$6.

467
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,478
Why, that's 25 cents apiece.
They're worth twice that much.

468
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,109
Not to me, they ain't.

469
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,383
-What are these?
-Them's prime winter pelts, Mr. Tomkins.

470
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,356
Mighty poor. They won't fetch that much.

471
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,028
I might allow you $1.50 apiece for 'em.

472
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,621
Well, I can get $3 apiece for 'em
in Jimtown.

473
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,826
It's quite a-ways to Jimtown.

474
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,597
Let's see now. That's $40.50.

475
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,066
-What else you got?
-Well, there's

476
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,131
two sacks of rabbit skins,

477
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,144
this here clock
and a sack of goose feathers.

478
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,174
I tell you, Alvin,

479
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,053
I'll give you 50 United States dollars
for the whole caboodle.

480
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,149
-$50 for everything?
-That's the best I can do.

481
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,696
-Sounds like an awful little.
-Take it or leave it.

482
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,259
Can you... Can you do any better
on the price of the land?

483
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,096
Not a cent. $120.

484
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,693
-How much time I got to pay for the rest?
-Sixty days.

485
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,262
Well, it's a bargain. I'll take it.

486
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,540
Well, then I reckon
we can put it in writing.

487
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,040
You understand now, don't you, Alvin?

488
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,845
If I don't get my money afore the 60 days,

489
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:12,355
you lose the whole caboodle
and you don't get the land.

490
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,325
Now, $70 is a lot of money
for a fellow like you to get his hands on.

491
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,294
It's more than a dollar a day.

492
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,490
Now then, 60 days is all you got.

493
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,898
Sixty days and sixty nights.

494
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,798
What?

495
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,500
Well, the way I figure,

496
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:34,908
if I count the nights, too, I got
nigh onto four months to pay you off.

497
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,806
Well, that's one way of figuring it.

498
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,210
Well, I'll tell you.

499
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,278
I was figuring on taking
'em rocks out myself, Alvin.

500
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,917
But if you're willing to take on the job
at 75 cents a day,

501
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,153
-well, I...
-I'll take it.

502
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,161
-All right.
-Yes, sir.

503
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:55,488
Well, I tell you. I was thinking
maybe I could shoe your mules for you.

504
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,620
Sorry, Alvin. Had 'em shod
just yesterday over to Possum Trot.

505
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:03,292
Might give you two, three days
work though, splitting rails.

506
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,800
That's good.

507
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,085
Oh, I reckon it's worth about...

508
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,857
-$3.
-$3?

509
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,421
Why, that's a right fair price, Pastor.

510
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,862
I only worked two days to get it.

511
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,989
It's worth it

512
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,361
to me.

513
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,268
All right, George, let him go.

514
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,806
Giddap, Noah, giddap. Come on.

515
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,967
-Giddap, Noah.
-Giddap, Noah.

516
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,271
Come on, Noah.

517
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,173
Come on.

518
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,860
Whoa, Noah.

519
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,092
What... Why, Miss Gracie,

520
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,867
I was thinking you was to the dance.

521
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,430
No. I ain't at the dance.

522
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,576
No. No, I can see that.

523
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,977
Alvin, I...

524
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:24,903
Yeah?

525
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,482
-Alvin, I just...
-Yeah?

526
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,776
I...

527
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,616
Alvin...

528
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,732
That's what I was wanting to tell you.

529
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,546
Giddap, Noah.

530
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,288
Lord...

531
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,123
Lord, if you can,

532
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,332
help him to be getting his land.

533
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,761
Amen.

534
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,132
All right, George.

535
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,502
Again.

536
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,572
Again.

537
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,277
Gotta get under there.

538
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,063
It ain't no use, George.

539
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,358
I can't do it.

540
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,896
-Yes, you can.
-I tell you, I can't do it!

541
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,871
My time's up tomorrow night!

542
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,649
There ain't enough money
for the bottomland.

543
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,052
I can't get the rest!

544
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,051
How?

545
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,193
How am I gonna do it?

546
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,384
-Howdy, Alvin.
-Mr. Tomkins, I've got to talk to you.

547
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,752
Well, I reckon it's money
what talks the loudest.

548
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,313
You got the rest of your payment?

549
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,757
-Well, no, I ain't got it all.
-That's bad.

550
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,729
-But I can get it for you by Saturday.
-Saturday ain't Tuesday.

551
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,264
All I'm asking is, is for four extra days.

552
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,563
How can I be sure
you'll get it by Saturday?

553
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:09,163
Well, there's a beef and turkey shoot
coming up. You must've heard about it.

554
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,503
-Yeah.
-I'm aiming to cut five targets

555
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:14,135
and win the beef critter
and then put him up for cash money.

556
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,076
-It ain't likely.
-Oh, yes, it is.

557
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,081
-That'll take some shooting, Alvin.
-But I could do it.

558
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,312
Well, I'd like to do you a favor, Alvin, but...

559
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,375
Will you?

560
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,547
There's another fellow
asking for that land.

561
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,147
-You ain't letting him have it.
-I don't know.

562
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,524
I was telling him
your option was up Tuesday and...

563
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:35,827
But I got to have 'em extra days,
Mr. Tomkins. I just got to.

564
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,027
Well, I oughtn't to do it,

565
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,799
but I reckon he can wait till Saturday.

566
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,604
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tomkins.
I'll sure get it for you.

567
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,303
Yes, I sure will.

568
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,915
You plumb missed him but you cut wood.

569
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:59,478
It ain't the log you're supposed to shoot,
Zeke, it's the critter behind it.

570
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,717
You better get yourself
a pair of 'em specs, Zeke.

571
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,818
He won't stick his head up
so I can get a shot at him.

572
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,863
Jim Corey, next shooter.

573
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,702
Reckon he's laying an egg back there, Jim?

574
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,369
Yeah, he might be.

575
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,337
You missed!

576
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,076
Doggone it, that turkey can sure hide.

577
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,549
Maybe he wants to keep his head.

578
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,654
Alvin York, next shooter.

579
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,316
Bust him in the eye, Alvin,
if he winks at you.

580
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,723
Shoot him when he ain't looking.

581
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,830
You better sight him mighty fine, Alvin.
That there is the last turkey.

582
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,094
You can't hit him
if you can't see him, Alvin.

583
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,606
Better wait till he goes to roost, Alvin.

584
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,450
You got meat!

585
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,850
He sure busted him wide open.

586
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,617
I reckon
you just got to talk their language, Alvin.

587
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,748
I reckon you do.

588
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,885
You sure got him, Alvin. Ought to be
eating good if he ain't too tough.

589
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,155
This here bird ain't for eating.

590
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,221
Come on, fellows.
Get your targets ready for the beef shoot.

591
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,393
Rules same as all as were.
Shots are $1 apiece.

592
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,527
The two best shooters
get the hindquarters.

593
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,572
The next two get the forequarters.

594
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,573
Fifth man gets the hide and the tallow.

595
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,836
The sixth man gets to dig the lead
out of the tree.

596
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,105
All right, pay your dollar
and draw your number.

597
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,808
Load her up careful, George.
We got a long ways to paddle.

598
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,946
-Here you be, Alvin.
-Thankee.

599
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,316
Hey, Zeke, you ain't paid your dollar yet.

600
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,652
Why, sure enough.
I reckon it just slipped my mind.

601
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,586
How much for this here bird?

602
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,761
Well, I can't give you
any more than one shot, I reckon.

603
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,460
I'll be taking it and give me four more.

604
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,629
Five shots? Am I hearing you right, Alvin?

605
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,669
I'm a wanting five shots, Lem.

606
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,366
You figuring to get that whole critter?

607
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,934
My mind's sort of running that a-way.

608
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,809
Where'd you get 'em ideas, Alvin?

609
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,475
You sure got some shooters against you.

610
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,075
They'll get a chance
when I put the critter up again.

611
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:12,053
I'm a-needing cash money
and I'm gonna get it.

612
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,888
Ain't nobody ever cut five centers
unless it were Daniel Boone.

613
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,587
And you ain't wearing no coonskin hat.

614
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,094
I ain't a-needing one.

615
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,933
Number eight next.

616
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,116
Number nine.

617
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,635
How do they stand so far, Luke?

618
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,171
Ain't nobody cut center but Alvin York.

619
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,071
Alvin cut dead center all four times.

620
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,712
Two more shooters.
Tom Carver, you're first.

621
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,543
Alvin's got one more coming.

622
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,105
Get going, Tom.

623
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,391
You better draw down, Alvin.

624
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,168
You got to beat Tom's shot
if you want to get the whole beef, Alvin.

625
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,315
What do it look like?

626
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,758
It looks like plumb middle to me.

627
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,234
Well, Tom ain't more than a hair off,

628
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,741
but Alvin's done cut dead center,
fair and square.

629
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,709
-Howdy, Daniel Boone.
-There's your beef, Alvin. All yours.

630
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,313
-Five centers is right smart shooting.
-I ain't seen it like since the big one.

631
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,290
Well, any of you fellows
want another chance at that critter,

632
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,293
why, just drop a dollar apiece
in this here hat.

633
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,192
Are you shooting against us, Alvin?

634
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,322
-No, hey, not this time.
-I ain't got a dollar.

635
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,389
-Lend me a dollar, Lem.
-Here's my dollar, Alvin.

636
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,725
You... You lend me a couple of...

637
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,634
-Howdy, Miss Miranda.
-Howdy.

638
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,194
-Hello, boys.
-Hello, there.

639
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,104
-You all come over to see the shooting?
-Yeah.

640
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,335
It's all over now.

641
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,607
Alvin York cut center five times
and won Lem's beef critter on the hoof.

642
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,978
-Alvin won Lem's beef critter?
-Sure did.

643
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,540
-Well, I'll be danged.
-And he's putting him up again.

644
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,109
Well, boys, get your targets ready.

645
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,619
Oh, Mr. Tomkins,
I was just coming over to see you.

646
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:39,291
Here you be, $26. And I've got
the rest of it right here in my pocket.

647
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:43,321
I'm right sorry, Alvin, but I just sold that
bottomland to Zeb here.

648
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,928
-You're telling me you...
-Now, don't go raring off, Alvin.

649
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,561
I never figured you'd get that money.

650
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,038
Anyway, your time was rightly up
last Tuesday.

651
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,077
-Why, you allowed I could have more...
-But it wasn't in writing.

652
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,543
But I was a-taking your word for it...

653
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,342
And Zeb here paid me cash money
all down.

654
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,242
-He did, did he?
-It ain't my fault. He sold it to me.

655
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,751
Now look here...

656
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:03,979
Alvin!

657
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,751
Business is business.

658
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,119
-Wait a minute!
-Get out of here!

659
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,418
You better get, both of you!

660
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:12,485
It ain't no use, Alvin. You'd only be
fixing yourself for trouble.

661
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:17,794
I was... I was aiming to get that
piece of land.

662
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,199
Well, it weren't to be.

663
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,137
Mind you, Alvin, we can't always
figure the ways of Providence.

664
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,671
Alvin...

665
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,683
-Alvin, it don't make no difference.
-It do to me.

666
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,214
Come on, Buck.

667
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,970
Swing her, Buck, swing her!

668
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:04,612
I sure do admire big women. She's about
that biggest that I ever did see.

669
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,814
Three women in one she is, Alvin.
A whole passel of women.

670
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,453
Hey, a fellow who'd marry her'd
be a bigamist.

671
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:20,694
See? Big-muss. Yes, sir, bigamist.

672
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,197
Told me I could have 'em extra days.

673
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,703
-Oh, come on, Alvin.
-His word weren't no count.

674
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,337
Forget about Nate Tomkins, will you?

675
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,170
Quit pestering yourself. It ain't no use.

676
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,204
Look at that there big woman.

677
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:40,181
Why don't you have a turn with her, Alvin?
Take you back to your log rolling days.

678
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,717
"Business is business."

679
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:45,380
Well, once around her
is twice around Bear Mountain.

680
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,425
Look at Buck here, Alvin.
He's plumb tuckered out.

681
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,858
-I sure am.
-Well, he might be,

682
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,824
dancing around a whole passel of women
that-a-way.

683
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,661
-Another bottle, Marter.
-Sure.

684
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,360
That land were mine.

685
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,094
Ain't nobody gonna get it away from me.

686
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,341
I'd sure like to see you
toad-hop her about, Alvin.

687
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,741
I'm a-drinking against Nate Tomkins.

688
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,610
Now, how about that there big woman?

689
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,010
Alvin, you better be a-staying here.

690
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,847
-Let go of me.
-We'll go along with you.

691
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,046
What I got to do is my own.

692
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,326
It sure ain't a good night for a killing.

693
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,128
There's no stopping him now, I reckon.

694
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,164
Give me that old time religion.

695
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,131
-Howdy, Mr. Tomkins.
-Look here. Stand where you are.

696
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,763
Don't you come any closer.

697
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,934
-Mr. Tomkins, I just want to...
-Come closer and I'll hit you.

698
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,342
No need of getting riled, Mr. Tomkins.

699
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:39,870
-I ain't a-looking for no trouble with you.
-What you doing around here?

700
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,474
-Well, I want to talk to you about...
-What about?

701
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:43,883
About Abraham.

702
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:46,786
That mule's legally mine.
You ain't got no claim on him.

703
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,187
Well, I ain't denying he's yours...

704
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,285
Stay where you are if you don't want to be
laid out in two pieces.

705
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,196
Well, I was a-figuring
on a-buying Abraham back.

706
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,700
-Buying him back?
-Yes, sir.

707
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,826
My mule's kind of poorly,

708
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,533
and something done happened to him
and I sure need a mule.

709
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,536
-Are you meaning it?
-Yes, sir.

710
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,604
No hard feelings?

711
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,846
-Shucks, no, Mr. Tomkins.
-Well, I'll be damned.

712
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,182
And... And there's one more thing.

713
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,754
I'm asking your forgiveness
for a-flaring up at you the way I done.

714
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,622
It were Satan a-speaking out of me.

715
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:31,229
Zeke was a-telling me, but I...
I couldn't believe him.

716
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,462
-About what?
-That you got religion.

717
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,097
-Well, that's a fact, Mr. Tomkins.
-Well, I'll be damned.

718
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,198
Well, I sure would like to be a-buying
that there mule back.

719
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,641
-You would, huh?
-Yeah.

720
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,805
-How much would you be asking for him?
-Well, let's see.

721
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,941
You said he was worth $40
and I allowed you $30.

722
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,211
That's right.

723
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,743
Well, you can have him back for $20.

724
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,923
Mr. Tomkins, Abraham's worth
a sight more than that.

725
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,187
Maybe he is,

726
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:03,221
but seeing as how I'm trying to do
the fair and square thing, Alvin, $20.

727
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:09,436
I reckon I know what you're thinking.
It's more blessed to give than to receive.

728
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,803
Maybe. Come on, get your mule.

729
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,234
And another thing, I'm gonna
give you back the clock you sold me.

730
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,643
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it don't run nohow.

731
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,055
-Howdy, Mr. Andrews.
-Howdy.

732
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,000
I'd kind of like to see Zeb,
are he hereabout?

733
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,434
Maybe he is.

734
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,139
I sure would like to have words with him.

735
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,134
You coming peaceful?

736
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,647
Yes, sir, Mr. Andrews.
I ain't looking for no trouble.

737
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,272
Zeb. Come out of there.

738
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,318
There he be.

739
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,282
Howdy.

740
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,421
What you'd be wanting with me,
Alvin York?

741
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:07,025
I want to talk to you, Zeb, about...
About that there piece of land.

742
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,961
I bought it, it's mine.

743
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,998
I know it, but...

744
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,228
Sure it's yours, Zeb, but...

745
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,570
But Nate Tomkins was...
Was a-figuring that...

746
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,438
I ain't caring
what Nate Tomkins was a-figuring.

747
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,776
-Well, Nate was just thinking...
-It's mine and I'm gonna keep it.

748
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,680
Well, sure it's yours, Zeb,
but if you'll only allow me to talk...

749
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,843
Ain't nobody a-holding you.

750
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,814
Oh, yes, they are.

751
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,523
Well, anyway, Nate was a-thinking
that your being so busy here,

752
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:38,059
maybe you need some extra help
on the other piece of land.

753
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:41,927
-Well, what's that got to do with you?
-Well, I'm asking you for the job.

754
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:46,458
-You mean you're aiming to work for me?
-I'd be if you allow me.

755
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,733
Well, shucks. That sure got me stumped.

756
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,407
I was a-buying that land just to spite you.

757
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,671
Well, I sure don't blame you none.

758
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,343
Well, maybe we can figure it
so you can sharecrop the piece.

759
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,316
Then you kind of be a-working for yourself.

760
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,114
No, I ain't asking for anything extra, Zeb.

761
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,418
Well, if you can farm that bottomland
like you've been doing the top,

762
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,017
I reckon that land will be yours
in a couple of seasons.

763
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,857
Well, with the help of the Lord,
I'll make you a good crop.

764
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,592
Like I'm saying, Miss Gracie,

765
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,124
I ain't ever seen a prettier piece of land
than that there Andrews farm.

766
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,933
Corn is thicker than fur on a squirrel.

767
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,634
And I seen eight beef critters
a-grazing in the pasture there.

768
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,643
That are a lot of critters.

769
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:32,772
And that Zeb Andrews
sure are a forgiving man.

770
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,873
-Is he?
-Yes, sir.

771
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,745
Be sitting, Alvin.

772
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,716
-And a Christian man, if I ever seen one.
-Reckon so.

773
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,521
What I done to him that night
we were visiting you weren't right.

774
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,119
The devil was a-pushing me from behind.

775
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,596
It were too dark. I couldn't see.

776
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,859
I didn't have no call
to come twixt you and him.

777
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,631
What are you getting at, Alvin York?

778
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:58,070
All I'm aiming to say, Miss Gracie, is,

779
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,907
a upstanding man like Zeb Andrews
would make a girl a right smart husband.

780
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,468
-What's that?
-And...

781
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:08,176
And if you change your mind about Zeb,
well, I reckon I could...

782
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,914
-You could what?
-I could rightly understand.

783
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,980
Oh, you could, could you?

784
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,283
Lookee here, Alvin York,

785
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,525
if I wanted Zeb Andrews for a husband,

786
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:23,121
I reckon I could get him
without your acting so noble.

787
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,394
-I done kissed you, didn't I?
-Yes.

788
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,062
Well, I don't go around kissing men
I ain't gonna be a-marrying.

789
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,695
Now you be a-listening to me.

790
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,967
-Am I marrying a piece of land?
-Yes. No.

791
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,167
-Or a beef critter?
-No.

792
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,300
Or a field of corn?

793
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,868
No, it's you I'm marrying,
ain't nobody else in this here world.

794
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,004
-Are you hearing me?
-Yes.

795
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,105
Well, then don't you talk that way
to me again, Alvin!

796
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,980
-No.
-Don't you ever!

797
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,744
Oh!

798
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,085
The Lord sure do move
in mysterious ways.

799
01:03:56,532 --> 01:04:00,662
So that's what the Lord done said to Cain
when he done killed Abel.

800
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,569
It was a way of telling him
that he wouldn't get no crops no more.

801
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,108
And anybody that's a farmer
knows what that means.

802
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:10,339
Alvin, how do you know that it happened
just that-a-way?

803
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,278
A-seeing how you weren't there.

804
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,781
Well, the Book says so.

805
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,843
And there ain't nothing written
in the Book that ain't the truth.

806
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:23,487
So, a long time after that

807
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:27,017
when the Lord was a-giving Moses
the Ten Commandments,

808
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,460
he was a-saying, "Thou shalt not kill."

809
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,695
Now... Now go ahead with the reading.

810
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:36,800
Hey! Hey! War! Hey!

811
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:39,271
Hey! Pastor Pile!

812
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,701
-What's happened, Luke?
-It's war.

813
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,746
President Wilson done declared war
against Germany.

814
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,304
-You don't say?
-Yes, sir.

815
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,179
It says so right here in this here paper.

816
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,956
Here you are, Jim.
I reckon I won't wait to be drafted.

817
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,161
-I'm joining up as soon as the corn's in.
-Me, too.

818
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,967
Attaboy, Tom. I heard my daddy talk
about fighting Yankees.

819
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,134
And my granddaddy
done fought in the Revolution.

820
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,743
Sure wish I was a young fellow.

821
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,110
Well, come along, Zeke.
You load 'em and I'll shoot 'em.

822
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:23,378
-Hi, Alvin.
-Hi, Alvin.

823
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,044
Hey, Alvin, what about you?

824
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:27,681
You joining up now
or you waiting to be called?

825
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,657
I reckon I'm a-waiting.

826
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,955
-Howdy, Ike.
-Hi, Alvin.

827
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,063
Howdy, Alvin.

828
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,295
Good morning, Pastor.
Reckon I need some coal oil.

829
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,871
I'm glad you come in, Alvin.
I was gonna send for you.

830
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,433
You was?

831
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:49,003
-You ain't registered yet, have you, Alvin?
-Of course I ain't.

832
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,979
Is that the new seed
you was gonna send for?

833
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,020
It's Tuesday, Alvin. You only got till 6:00.

834
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,079
I ain't a-gonna register.

835
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,555
Come here.

836
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,860
-You gotta register, Alvin.
-I ain't a-going to. I ain't a-going to war.

837
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,858
War is killing
and the Book's against killing.

838
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,732
So war is against the Book.

839
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,033
You're plumb right, Alvin.

840
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,134
You got the using kind of religion,
not the meetinghouse kind, but you...

841
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,839
-The kind I got's the kind you teached me.
-I know that.

842
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,974
And I hate to be telling you, but
I don't want to see you get in no trouble.

843
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,074
Now, you got to register

844
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,641
and there ain't no way
you can get out of it.

845
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,121
You mean they can make you go to war
even if it's against what you think is right?

846
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,990
No, no, no, they won't make you do that.
It's what I want to tell you.

847
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,357
Come here.

848
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,921
It's right here.

849
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,231
Let me see.

850
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:49,730
Now, wait a minute. Here.
There it is right there, see?

851
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,906
"Members of well-recognized
religious sects

852
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,877
"whose existent creed
forbids its members to participate in war

853
01:06:56,946 --> 01:07:00,746
"are entitled to request exemption
from military service."

854
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,716
What... What's that there exemption?

855
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,653
Well, that, it means,
if you're exempted, you don't have to go.

856
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,451
Well, how do I get this exemption?

857
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,755
Well, you got to write a letter
to the draft board.

858
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,895
-Is that all there is to it?
-Yep.

859
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:19,325
Well. Well, sure I'll register.
Will you write the letter for me?

860
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,427
Why, I'd be glad to, Alvin.
Come on over here.

861
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,232
"Therefore, we find
that we can't consider your church

862
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,038
"a well-recognized religious sect,

863
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:32,478
"organized and existing, May 18, 1917.

864
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,185
"We find further, that it has
no special creed except the Bible,

865
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:40,552
"which can be interpreted
by its members as they choose.

866
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,853
"And finally, there's nothing
in the creed of the church,

867
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,894
"expressly forbidding its members
to participate in war.

868
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,294
"Therefore your application for exemption
is denied."

869
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,562
Is this here the last word
or has he got some place to appeal?

870
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,901
He can appeal to
the District Board at Nashville

871
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,372
and finally to the General Board
in Washington.

872
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,273
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

873
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,833
You're welcome.

874
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:08,348
I'll be a-writing 'em appeals for you,
Alvin, so don't you be worrying.

875
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,009
Oh, I ain't a-worrying.

876
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,992
We'll be a-fixing this here bridge.

877
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,229
There it is.

878
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:33,969
So, we'll be a-building the house
right over there by that tree.

879
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,375
And the big room is gonna be...

880
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:41,680
The big room is gonna be right...
Right here in front, just like this.

881
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,010
And it's gonna have three windows.

882
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:48,250
And the kitchen will be here,
and it's gonna be good and big, too.

883
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,223
-And there'll be a stove.
-Where?

884
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,284
Well, right about there.

885
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,790
And I'm gonna build you one of 'em sinks.

886
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,958
And I'm gonna give you a pump,
so you won't have to carry

887
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,125
no water from the springs.

888
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,066
-A pump, Alvin?
-Sure.

889
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,035
Alvin, pumps costs a heap of money.

890
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:06,905
Well, we're gonna have curtains in the
windows and carpets on the floors.

891
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,568
And it ain't gonna take very long either

892
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,169
if the Lord keeps a-showering
his blessings on me.

893
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,408
Won't take more than two, three years,
I reckon.

894
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:18,078
Just to think, in two, three years,
a house right there where we're looking.

895
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,713
And it will be our house.

896
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:25,086
-Alvin.
-What do you want?

897
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,520
Pastor Pile wants to see you, Alvin.

898
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,860
Well, Gracie and me
is kind of busy right now.

899
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,230
Well, tell him I'll stop by the store
on the way home.

900
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,428
He said he wants to see you right off.

901
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,027
He said you best be a-coming.

902
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,335
Well, tell him I'll be there.

903
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,107
Shucks, just when we was having fun.

904
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,407
Would you be
a-telling me again sometime?

905
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,844
I sure will.

906
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:59,187
-Howdy, Pastor.
-Howdy, Alvin.

907
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,723
I got right bad news for you.

908
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,664
Word just come.
They're a-taking you for the army.

909
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,995
Well, that can't be.

910
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:09,196
That letter we done sent to Washington,
says that I was against fighting and...

911
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,262
They ain't going to exempt you, Alvin.

912
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,332
You got to report to Nashville
tomorrow night.

913
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,202
I ain't a-going.

914
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,747
You ain't got no choice.
This was the last appeal.

915
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,614
I don't care about that. I ain't a-going.

916
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,851
You've got to go, Alvin. It's the law.

917
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:27,980
What?

918
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,423
What kind of law is it
that says a man's got to go

919
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,585
against the Book and its teachings?

920
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,494
Well, I reckon there ain't no answer, but,

921
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,630
if you don't go,
they'll be a-coming after you.

922
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,102
Well, they won't get me.
I'll go back in 'em hills.

923
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,001
Yeah, and they'll put hounds on your trail,

924
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,633
and they'll follow you
no matter how far back you go.

925
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:51,612
Then they'd better not catch up with me,
'cause they'll be a-wishing they hadn't. I...

926
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,783
Sorry, Pastor, I... Them's sinful words.

927
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,585
I wasn't thinking of what I was saying.

928
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,354
I'll go.

929
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:11,530
War's away to the other side
of the ocean, Alvin.

930
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,061
Lots of things can happen
before you get there.

931
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:20,800
You put your trust in the Lord
and he'll look out for you.

932
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,776
I done forgot the Lord.

933
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,040
I ain't never gonna forget him again.

934
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,442
Goodbye, Alvin.

935
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:50,898
Well...

936
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:58,703
I reckon these'll do till I get fixed up
in government clothes.

937
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,789
The corn's doing right good
on the south hill.

938
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,386
It might need a little extra hoeing.

939
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,994
Mule's at the gate.
You got a long ways to go.

940
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,501
Well, you'll be taking care of things
from now on, George.

941
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:29,839
Sure will.

942
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,710
I guess you'll be needing a man-sized gun.

943
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,783
-You can have my rifle.
-I'm a-thanking you.

944
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,749
Well...

945
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,658
I'm going.

946
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,399
I had to see you again, Alvin. I just had to.

947
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,004
Now, now...

948
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,777
No, no, don't you be looking at me, please.

949
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,242
Don't want you to be
remembering me like this.

950
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,356
Close your eyes, please?

951
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,351
Yessum.

952
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,484
-Are they closed?
-Yes.

953
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:31,904
Bye, Alvin.

954
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,844
I'll be a-coming back.

955
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:10,743
Bye, Alvin.

956
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,279
I'll be a-coming back.

957
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:21,413
Ma.

958
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,918
What are they a-fighting for?

959
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,688
I don't rightly know, child.

960
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,925
I don't rightly know.

961
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:44,803
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.

962
01:14:44,877 --> 01:14:46,276
Okay, Sarge.

963
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:52,783
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon
you got there, it's a shovel.

964
01:14:52,852 --> 01:14:55,013
-Lay into it.
-Okay, General.

965
01:14:55,154 --> 01:14:56,621
Dig, soldiers, dig.

966
01:14:56,856 --> 01:14:58,448
Dig your way straight down to China.

967
01:14:58,524 --> 01:15:00,253
-Okay, Sarge.
-China?

968
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:04,756
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.

969
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:10,735
Parsons, Sergeant Early.

970
01:15:11,937 --> 01:15:13,199
Yes, sir.

971
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:15,406
Which one of your men is York?

972
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:17,999
He is the big, lanky fellow,
fourth from the end, sir.

973
01:15:18,077 --> 01:15:20,671
-Having any trouble with him?
-No, sir. Why?

974
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:23,743
He's down here
as a conscientious objector.

975
01:15:23,816 --> 01:15:26,011
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.

976
01:15:26,085 --> 01:15:27,347
Yes, sir.

977
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:34,923
That'll be a big help.

978
01:15:35,594 --> 01:15:37,084
Dig. Dig. Dig.

979
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,867
I've been working in a subway all my life,
never thought about the guys that dug it.

980
01:15:42,935 --> 01:15:46,166
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.

981
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:48,138
-Subway you say?
-Yeah.

982
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:50,139
What's this here subway
you're talking about?

983
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:52,871
You mean to say you don't know
what a subway is? That guy kidding?

984
01:15:52,945 --> 01:15:55,038
No, they don't have subways
where he comes from, I guess.

985
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:57,674
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?

986
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,776
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.

987
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:02,944
-Where is that?
-Tennessee.

988
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,917
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?

989
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:08,255
-Ain't never even heard of one.
-You never... What? Heard?

990
01:16:08,327 --> 01:16:10,227
Heard? What kind of talk is that?

991
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:12,594
Do they all talk that kind of English
where you come from?

992
01:16:12,665 --> 01:16:16,726
Well, there ain't any English people
down our way, just Americans.

993
01:16:16,902 --> 01:16:20,099
Well, look, a subway is a big hole
in the ground, see?

994
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:21,866
It goes for miles.

995
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:24,273
-Straight down?
-Yeah... No.

996
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:26,711
It doesn't go straight down,
it goes this way.

997
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:28,371
-Oh, this a-way?
-Yeah.

998
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,641
-Under the ground?
-Under the ground.

999
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:33,480
-And trains run through it.
-They run through it?

1000
01:16:33,552 --> 01:16:35,452
-Yeah.
-Steam cars?

1001
01:16:35,521 --> 01:16:37,853
Steam... No. Steam cars.

1002
01:16:37,923 --> 01:16:40,858
-They're electric, Alvin.
-I sure would like to see one of 'em.

1003
01:16:40,926 --> 01:16:43,258
You see, they have to run trains
under the ground in New York,

1004
01:16:43,329 --> 01:16:45,593
-because it's so crowded.
-Crowded? I'll say.

1005
01:16:45,664 --> 01:16:48,155
Look, it's the rush hour,
the Bronx Express is just pulling in.

1006
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:50,224
I'm standing on the platform,
holding back the mob.

1007
01:16:50,302 --> 01:16:53,135
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?

1008
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:54,968
Just a word now and then.

1009
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,168
Well, you see, the people are just coming
from work and they wanna get home, see,

1010
01:16:58,243 --> 01:16:59,801
and they wanna get into the cars
all together.

1011
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:01,607
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.

1012
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:05,446
Well, anyway, the doors open up and
now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.

1013
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:07,041
"Move back in the cars," I yell.

1014
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:10,020
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."

1015
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:13,490
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used
to pack them in like sardines in a can.

1016
01:17:13,559 --> 01:17:14,787
That's why they call me "Pusher."

1017
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,725
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.

1018
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:18,763
-Get a move on.
-Yes, sir.

1019
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:22,563
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.

1020
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:25,703
-2-4-1-8-0-0.
-Zaranopolis Nick.

1021
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:29,840
2-4-1-8-0-1.

1022
01:17:29,908 --> 01:17:32,672
-2-4-1-8-0-1.
-Ross, Michael T.

1023
01:17:32,745 --> 01:17:34,838
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?

1024
01:17:34,913 --> 01:17:37,677
-Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
-Sure.

1025
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:42,483
-2-1-8-1-0-2.
-2-1-8-1-0-2.

1026
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:45,779
York, Alvin C.

1027
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:48,091
Anything wrong with it?

1028
01:17:48,827 --> 01:17:50,954
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.

1029
01:17:51,063 --> 01:17:55,193
I thought maybe you might have
some conscientious objections to it.

1030
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:57,028
No, sir, I ain't.

1031
01:17:57,136 --> 01:18:00,697
Careful you don't kill anybody with it
till we get to France.

1032
01:18:00,773 --> 01:18:02,798
-Next man.
-There you are, York.

1033
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:07,403
-2-1-4-8-0-3.
-2-1-4-8-0-3.

1034
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:09,003
Thomas, Bert E.

1035
01:18:17,222 --> 01:18:19,281
Boy, look at that shine,
is that clean or is that clean?

1036
01:18:19,358 --> 01:18:21,451
Look, Sarge, you can eat
right off the trigger.

1037
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:22,687
Not bad.

1038
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,025
You call that clean?

1039
01:18:27,099 --> 01:18:29,533
-What's the matter with it?
-Look.

1040
01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:32,965
-I don't see nothing.
-It's full of grease.

1041
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:34,699
Won't that make the bullet
come out faster?

1042
01:18:34,773 --> 01:18:36,001
Clean it.

1043
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:38,977
That's a good job, York.

1044
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:41,146
Did you ever clean a rifle before?

1045
01:18:41,213 --> 01:18:44,876
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.

1046
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,611
So you've got a gun of your own,
have you?

1047
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:49,620
-Yes, sir.
-I wouldn't think you'd have one.

1048
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:03,095
Well, the next time get your sling
a little higher on your arm.

1049
01:19:03,168 --> 01:19:04,294
Okay.

1050
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,166
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.

1051
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:10,902
Now, remember, you guys,
you're using real, live ammunition.

1052
01:19:10,976 --> 01:19:14,969
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.

1053
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:17,138
So don't start murdering each other.

1054
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:19,946
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.

1055
01:19:20,018 --> 01:19:21,645
Ready, number 30.

1056
01:19:22,855 --> 01:19:24,982
Not yet, we'll try it first.

1057
01:19:26,425 --> 01:19:29,326
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.

1058
01:19:29,428 --> 01:19:30,861
Take a deep breath.

1059
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,261
Blow, let a little of it out.

1060
01:19:33,966 --> 01:19:35,194
Hold it.

1061
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:37,667
Remember, keep your sights
on the center of the bull's-eye.

1062
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:39,704
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.

1063
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:43,208
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.

1064
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:45,743
Ready? Aim.

1065
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:49,771
I can't hold it no more.

1066
01:19:49,848 --> 01:19:52,248
All right, Ross, take another one.

1067
01:19:52,718 --> 01:19:53,810
Aim.

1068
01:19:55,187 --> 01:19:56,245
Fire.

1069
01:19:56,321 --> 01:19:59,290
Look, Ross, you had your thumb
sticking straight up in the air.

1070
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:00,518
Just like that.

1071
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,991
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.

1072
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,358
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?

1073
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:05,794
-Yeah.
-Here.

1074
01:20:06,832 --> 01:20:07,890
Load.

1075
01:20:09,902 --> 01:20:10,926
Aim.

1076
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:15,238
-Fire.
-Oh, my eye.

1077
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:17,766
Maybe that will teach you
to keep your thumb down.

1078
01:20:17,843 --> 01:20:21,210
That's something
for the rest of you men to remember.

1079
01:20:27,419 --> 01:20:28,943
-A miss.
-Miss.

1080
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:31,149
Ready on number 29.

1081
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:33,122
Ready on 29.

1082
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:34,523
Ready, 29.

1083
01:20:36,728 --> 01:20:39,629
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.

1084
01:20:39,731 --> 01:20:41,722
Aim. Fire.

1085
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,396
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.

1086
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:48,996
All right, next time get that sling
a little higher on your arm.

1087
01:20:49,074 --> 01:20:50,564
Press your cheek
a little closer to the stock.

1088
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:51,666
Yes, sir.

1089
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:54,644
Make sure that front sight
divides the rear sight in half.

1090
01:20:54,713 --> 01:20:56,874
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.

1091
01:20:56,949 --> 01:20:59,042
You reckon you know about that, do you?

1092
01:20:59,117 --> 01:21:00,744
We'll see. Here.

1093
01:21:03,088 --> 01:21:04,988
Load. Aim.

1094
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:10,719
Fire.

1095
01:21:14,433 --> 01:21:16,162
-A miss!
-Miss.

1096
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:20,494
So you know about sighting, do you?

1097
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:23,140
I sure thought I cut plumb center
that time.

1098
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:24,641
You did, huh?

1099
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:28,373
I can't no ways see how I can miss
that whole great big target.

1100
01:21:28,447 --> 01:21:31,041
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.

1101
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,274
Re-mark for 29.

1102
01:21:33,352 --> 01:21:35,081
Re-mark, 29.

1103
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,579
Oh, I didn't see that one.

1104
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,252
-A bull's-eye, 4:00.
-Bull's-eye.

1105
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:47,997
I can't figure out how I got
way down there on the edge.

1106
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:51,433
Well, I reckon I can do a little better
when I get used to this here rifle gun.

1107
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:53,903
Here's five chances to do better.

1108
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:00,769
Fire when ready.

1109
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:06,108
Hey, what are you wetting
that front sight for?

1110
01:22:06,652 --> 01:22:08,916
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.

1111
01:22:08,987 --> 01:22:12,650
I always wet my sights
when I'm fixing to do some shooting.

1112
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:15,250
Okay, do some shooting.

1113
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:27,197
-Bull's-eye, dead center.
-Bull's-eye.

1114
01:22:27,306 --> 01:22:29,570
Okay, York. You're on your own.

1115
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:38,405
-Bull's-eye.
-Bull's-eye.

1116
01:22:43,822 --> 01:22:46,052
-Bull's-eye.
-Bull's-eye.

1117
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,454
-Bull's-eye.
-Bull's-eye.

1118
01:22:58,036 --> 01:23:00,095
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.

1119
01:23:00,172 --> 01:23:02,163
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.

1120
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,265
Let's see that target, Sergeant.

1121
01:23:05,243 --> 01:23:07,370
Bring 29 to the firing line.

1122
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:15,979
There's the first shot,
and here's the other five here.

1123
01:23:16,054 --> 01:23:18,955
I reckon that there gun
shoots a might to the right.

1124
01:23:19,024 --> 01:23:21,515
Where did you learn to shoot, York?

1125
01:23:21,626 --> 01:23:24,322
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.

1126
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:28,127
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.

1127
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,532
But they was exaggerating some.

1128
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:36,630
Now, supposing these here cartridges
is a flock of wild turkeys,

1129
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:39,700
a-flying across the ridge
coming this a-way, see, right at me.

1130
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:41,405
Now, which one of them
would you shoot first?

1131
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,778
I'd take a crack at all of 'em
and trust to luck.

1132
01:23:43,849 --> 01:23:45,817
Well, you wouldn't have no luck
that way, Pusher.

1133
01:23:45,884 --> 01:23:48,717
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.

1134
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:52,347
-The what?
-The motorman. The guy out in front.

1135
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:55,622
Well, that ain't right either,
if you wanna get more than one turkey.

1136
01:23:55,694 --> 01:23:57,423
Now, which one of them's
got the most meat on him?

1137
01:23:57,496 --> 01:23:59,088
Yeah, what's the answer?

1138
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,394
Well, now, if you shoot this one here,
the leader,

1139
01:24:01,466 --> 01:24:03,764
the rest of 'em will see him drop
and fly off, see?

1140
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:07,032
So, you draw down
on the last turkey here,

1141
01:24:07,706 --> 01:24:09,799
and then the next one, see?

1142
01:24:10,075 --> 01:24:12,509
Kind of coming from back to front.

1143
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:15,435
Then the rest of 'em won't know
they're being hit.

1144
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:16,606
And, if...

1145
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:19,582
Of course, they might flare off some
when the shooting starts,

1146
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:21,949
but if a fellow's got himself
a repeating rifle,

1147
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,011
he's got a good chance
of getting the whole flock.

1148
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:26,751
-Sounds all right.
-Turkeys sure is dumb animals.

1149
01:24:26,825 --> 01:24:29,760
Seems you picked up a good bit
down in the hills, Alvin.

1150
01:24:29,828 --> 01:24:32,296
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting
knows that.

1151
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:35,561
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.

1152
01:24:35,634 --> 01:24:38,296
-Yes, sir.
-What have you been up to now?

1153
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,635
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.

1154
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:42,764
It's your move.

1155
01:24:45,877 --> 01:24:49,074
-Private York reporting, sir.
-Yes, York. At ease.

1156
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:54,250
York, Captain Danforth has just
handed me a report concerning you,

1157
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:56,219
made by your company sergeant.

1158
01:24:56,288 --> 01:24:57,550
Yes, sir?

1159
01:24:57,689 --> 01:25:00,283
You have a very excellent camp record.

1160
01:25:01,093 --> 01:25:03,561
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.

1161
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:07,291
You applied for exemption, I believe,
as a conscientious objector.

1162
01:25:07,365 --> 01:25:08,627
Yes, sir.

1163
01:25:08,834 --> 01:25:11,359
Well, I think we can disregard that.

1164
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:15,435
York, Sergeant Parsons
recommends your promotion

1165
01:25:15,507 --> 01:25:17,566
to the rank of corporal with special detail

1166
01:25:17,642 --> 01:25:20,270
as instructor in target practice.

1167
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:23,314
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.

1168
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:25,349
I congratulate you, York.

1169
01:25:26,518 --> 01:25:30,511
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.

1170
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:34,483
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot
the best I can,

1171
01:25:34,559 --> 01:25:36,891
like I already done Pusher and Bert.

1172
01:25:36,962 --> 01:25:41,558
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir,
but,

1173
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:45,701
well, I don't want to be no corporal.

1174
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:48,864
-What's that?
-I said I don't want to be no corporal.

1175
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,100
-Why not?
-Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.

1176
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:53,938
Well, you see, I...

1177
01:25:54,012 --> 01:25:56,742
Is it because of your
religious convictions, York?

1178
01:25:56,815 --> 01:25:58,544
Yes, sir. That's it.

1179
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,382
You see, I believe in the Bible,

1180
01:26:01,653 --> 01:26:06,317
and I'm a-believing
that this here life we're living

1181
01:26:06,391 --> 01:26:08,825
is something the Lord done give us.

1182
01:26:08,894 --> 01:26:11,692
And we got to be a-living it
the best we can.

1183
01:26:11,763 --> 01:26:15,756
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks

1184
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:20,168
ain't no part of what he was intending
for us to be a-doing here.

1185
01:26:21,907 --> 01:26:24,205
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.

1186
01:26:24,276 --> 01:26:26,244
York, with your permission, Major?

1187
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:28,802
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.

1188
01:26:29,414 --> 01:26:32,144
You... You say you believe in the Bible?

1189
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:33,813
Yes, sir.

1190
01:26:33,952 --> 01:26:35,544
Well, I do, too.

1191
01:26:35,954 --> 01:26:39,185
But do you believe that the Bible means
that a man shouldn't fight

1192
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:41,623
for what he believes to be right?

1193
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:43,656
Well, it done said,

1194
01:26:44,296 --> 01:26:46,161
"Blessed are the peacemakers."

1195
01:26:46,231 --> 01:26:47,926
Yes, I know, but...

1196
01:26:48,967 --> 01:26:51,959
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke,

1197
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:57,069
where he says, "He that hath no sword,
let him sell his garment, and buy one"?

1198
01:26:57,142 --> 01:26:58,973
He said that to Peter.

1199
01:26:59,477 --> 01:27:01,468
But he doesn't stop Peter
from using his sword.

1200
01:27:01,546 --> 01:27:05,676
He said, "Them that lives by the sword
will be a-perishing by the sword."

1201
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,377
That were further on.

1202
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:10,716
-Yes, I remember, but...
-No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.

1203
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:12,980
But according to St. John,

1204
01:27:13,258 --> 01:27:16,557
he said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

1205
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:20,261
"If my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servant fight."

1206
01:27:20,332 --> 01:27:22,163
Well, that's just the point, Captain.

1207
01:27:22,234 --> 01:27:25,328
He done said
his kingdom were not of this world.

1208
01:27:25,637 --> 01:27:27,730
And that... That is different.

1209
01:27:27,806 --> 01:27:30,331
-Yes, but...
-Just a moment, Captain.

1210
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:33,204
York, have you ever read this?

1211
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,843
"History of the United States."

1212
01:27:39,017 --> 01:27:41,144
It sure is a lot of writing.

1213
01:27:46,124 --> 01:27:47,887
-Daniel Boone?
-Yeah.

1214
01:27:48,627 --> 01:27:49,958
You know about him?

1215
01:27:50,028 --> 01:27:52,428
Well, everybody down our way
knows about Daniel Boone.

1216
01:27:52,497 --> 01:27:54,658
First man into
the Valley of the Three Forks.

1217
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:57,930
Yes, he was quite a man,
one of the greatest.

1218
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,538
And that book's full of great men.

1219
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:07,340
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for

1220
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:09,710
when he went out alone
into the wilderness?

1221
01:28:09,781 --> 01:28:12,181
Well, I never thought much on it.

1222
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:14,779
Was he looking for new lands?

1223
01:28:14,919 --> 01:28:16,682
-Might be.
-Maybe.

1224
01:28:17,622 --> 01:28:19,590
Maybe for something more.

1225
01:28:19,891 --> 01:28:24,624
Something that a man just can't see
with his eyes or hold in his hands.

1226
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:29,333
Something that some men don't even
know they have until they've lost it.

1227
01:28:29,401 --> 01:28:31,733
-Yes, sir.
-To be free.

1228
01:28:33,371 --> 01:28:35,771
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.

1229
01:28:36,574 --> 01:28:38,701
I think that's what he wanted.

1230
01:28:38,777 --> 01:28:42,508
I think that's what sent Boone
into your Tennessee country.

1231
01:28:42,814 --> 01:28:45,282
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?

1232
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,476
Yep.

1233
01:28:47,118 --> 01:28:50,679
That's the story of a whole people's
struggle for freedom

1234
01:28:50,755 --> 01:28:53,223
from the very beginning until now.

1235
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:55,384
For we're still struggling.

1236
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:58,086
It's quite a story, York.

1237
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:01,827
How they all got together
and set up a government,

1238
01:29:03,034 --> 01:29:06,697
whereby all men were pledged
to defend the rights of each man,

1239
01:29:06,771 --> 01:29:09,740
and each man
to defend the rights of all men.

1240
01:29:10,408 --> 01:29:13,809
We call it a government of the people,

1241
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:17,479
by the people and for the people.

1242
01:29:19,684 --> 01:29:22,585
Why, I never knowed
it was all written down.

1243
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:25,685
-You're a religious man, York.
-Yes, sir.

1244
01:29:26,991 --> 01:29:29,152
You want to worship God
in your own way.

1245
01:29:29,227 --> 01:29:30,387
Yes, sir.

1246
01:29:30,462 --> 01:29:32,555
-You're a farmer?
-Yes, sir.

1247
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,894
You want to plow your fields
as you see fit,

1248
01:29:34,966 --> 01:29:38,129
and raise your family
according to your own likes?

1249
01:29:38,203 --> 01:29:42,071
And that's your heritage and mine,
every American's.

1250
01:29:42,507 --> 01:29:44,304
But the cost of that heritage is high.

1251
01:29:44,376 --> 01:29:48,278
Sometimes it takes all we have
to preserve it, even our lives.

1252
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,612
How you gonna answer that, York?

1253
01:29:53,017 --> 01:29:54,211
Well...

1254
01:29:54,986 --> 01:29:58,478
You done given me a powerful lot
to be a-thinking about.

1255
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:02,322
Well, take your time.

1256
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:07,958
Well, if I could only get home,
back in 'em there hills, I...

1257
01:30:08,032 --> 01:30:10,557
-What would you do?
-Well, I could...

1258
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:14,100
I could figure something out.

1259
01:30:15,206 --> 01:30:17,606
I've done a heap of thinking
up yonder there once.

1260
01:30:17,675 --> 01:30:20,109
All right, take 10 days' furlough.

1261
01:30:20,612 --> 01:30:21,909
You mean I can go home?

1262
01:30:22,247 --> 01:30:24,147
And when you get back,
if you still can't see it our way,

1263
01:30:24,215 --> 01:30:25,307
I'll recommend your exemption.

1264
01:30:25,383 --> 01:30:27,681
-You will?
-Report to me as soon as you get back.

1265
01:30:27,752 --> 01:30:29,879
I'll arrange your furlough, York,
starting tomorrow.

1266
01:30:29,954 --> 01:30:31,819
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

1267
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,654
I sure would like to read this here book.

1268
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:37,456
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.

1269
01:30:37,529 --> 01:30:40,896
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.

1270
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:58,215
Come on, boy.

1271
01:31:53,505 --> 01:31:56,963
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma,
or just three?

1272
01:31:57,675 --> 01:31:59,302
Can't say, child.

1273
01:32:00,545 --> 01:32:03,207
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?

1274
01:32:04,382 --> 01:32:08,682
The Book says
man don't live by bread alone.

1275
01:32:09,387 --> 01:32:12,447
Well, what about that there hound dog
he's got with him?

1276
01:32:12,524 --> 01:32:14,355
He can't read the Book.

1277
01:32:15,426 --> 01:32:17,053
Get the table set.

1278
01:32:22,233 --> 01:32:25,168
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.

1279
01:32:25,904 --> 01:32:28,099
Want George to go get him, Ma?

1280
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:32,408
Let him be.

1281
01:32:49,827 --> 01:32:51,692
Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.

1282
01:32:51,763 --> 01:32:54,357
But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.

1283
01:32:54,432 --> 01:32:57,026
Them that lived by the sword,
will be a-perishing by the sword.

1284
01:32:57,101 --> 01:32:59,569
The government of all men
to defend the rights of each man.

1285
01:32:59,637 --> 01:33:01,662
And each man
to defend the rights of all men.

1286
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:04,469
Remember, the Lord done said,
"Thou shalt not kill."

1287
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:06,567
But the cost of that heritage is high.

1288
01:33:06,644 --> 01:33:08,942
Sometimes all we have to preserve it,
even our lives.

1289
01:33:09,013 --> 01:33:11,504
-Obey your God.
-Defend your country.

1290
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:13,380
-Your God.
-Your country.

1291
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:14,782
-Your God.
-Your country.

1292
01:33:14,852 --> 01:33:15,841
-God.
-Country.

1293
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:16,944
-God.
-Country.

1294
01:33:17,021 --> 01:33:18,386
-God.
-Country...

1295
01:33:30,501 --> 01:33:33,095
"Render therefore unto Caesar

1296
01:33:33,471 --> 01:33:35,803
"the things which were Caesar's,

1297
01:33:36,374 --> 01:33:41,141
"and unto God
the things that were God's."

1298
01:33:43,815 --> 01:33:46,613
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.

1299
01:33:49,387 --> 01:33:52,652
And unto God, God's.

1300
01:34:09,741 --> 01:34:12,266
-Private York reporting, sir.
-Have him come in.

1301
01:34:12,343 --> 01:34:14,402
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.

1302
01:34:18,616 --> 01:34:22,177
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.

1303
01:34:22,253 --> 01:34:24,187
Well, you're welcome, York.

1304
01:34:24,255 --> 01:34:26,917
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.

1305
01:34:26,991 --> 01:34:29,858
-Well?
-I'd like to stay in this here army.

1306
01:34:30,495 --> 01:34:32,360
I rather hoped that you would, York.

1307
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:36,025
But there's just one thing, sir,
that I ought to tell you.

1308
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:37,995
There's lots of things...

1309
01:34:38,069 --> 01:34:40,196
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.

1310
01:34:40,271 --> 01:34:43,172
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.

1311
01:34:43,274 --> 01:34:46,903
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.

1312
01:34:47,178 --> 01:34:51,877
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in
something that's a heap bigger than I be.

1313
01:34:54,318 --> 01:34:59,255
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel
called upon to look into your conscience.

1314
01:35:00,091 --> 01:35:02,616
It's enough for me that I trust you.

1315
01:35:03,094 --> 01:35:06,757
And I believe that when the time comes,
you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.

1316
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,093
Thank you, sir.

1317
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:12,000
And I'm going to approve your promotion
to the rank of corporal.

1318
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:15,870
Well, I'll sure take care of my men
the best I can, sir.

1319
01:35:15,973 --> 01:35:17,804
I know you will, York.

1320
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:20,604
-That's all.
-Thank you, Major.

1321
01:35:24,082 --> 01:35:27,882
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?

1322
01:35:28,386 --> 01:35:31,253
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?

1323
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:34,320
No, I don't think so, Captain.

1324
01:35:35,026 --> 01:35:37,961
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.

1325
01:35:46,337 --> 01:35:47,668
"Dear Mom,

1326
01:35:48,005 --> 01:35:52,237
"am feeling just fine
and have taken in all the sights.

1327
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:56,804
"And Bert took me to a church
called Notre Dame Cathedral.

1328
01:35:57,749 --> 01:36:02,209
"It's big enough inside for a fellow
to plant a crop of corn.

1329
01:36:04,555 --> 01:36:06,284
"Pusher just come in.

1330
01:36:06,357 --> 01:36:10,453
"He's saying our outfit is moving up
to front pretty soon.

1331
01:36:11,062 --> 01:36:15,362
"I reckon that's so
'cause we got all our training

1332
01:36:15,433 --> 01:36:19,301
"and they ain't brought us here
for no sight-seeing tour..."

1333
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,361
"Tour, nohow.

1334
01:36:22,673 --> 01:36:26,040
"Gracie wrote in her letter
she was a-worrying.

1335
01:36:26,878 --> 01:36:28,539
"Tell her, don't."

1336
01:36:30,114 --> 01:36:33,140
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.

1337
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:36,910
It ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.

1338
01:36:38,289 --> 01:36:40,154
Alvin's in good hands.

1339
01:36:41,559 --> 01:36:45,017
The Lord takes care of 'em
that's a-believing in Him.

1340
01:37:15,526 --> 01:37:18,324
-Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
-Yeah.

1341
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:20,529
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

1342
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:23,529
You know, you Yanks just got here
in the nick of time.

1343
01:37:23,601 --> 01:37:25,660
We're running shy of these.

1344
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:28,095
Besides, we can do with some help.

1345
01:37:28,172 --> 01:37:29,434
Look out.

1346
01:37:37,114 --> 01:37:41,050
It takes a while, but you'll learn
when to flop and when not to.

1347
01:37:41,285 --> 01:37:43,879
They say you never hear
the one that's hit you.

1348
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:46,116
That's only half the truth.

1349
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:49,990
No, the whole truth is,
if you hears it, you've got a chance.

1350
01:37:50,962 --> 01:37:52,054
Duck.

1351
01:37:56,534 --> 01:37:57,899
See what I mean?

1352
01:37:58,135 --> 01:38:02,367
-Heinie's got the range good.
-Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.

1353
01:38:02,974 --> 01:38:06,432
-Look out.
-Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.

1354
01:38:08,613 --> 01:38:09,671
See?

1355
01:38:12,783 --> 01:38:15,946
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.

1356
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,081
Duck again.

1357
01:38:27,398 --> 01:38:30,925
If that was shrapnel, now,
we wouldn't be flopping at all.

1358
01:38:31,002 --> 01:38:33,402
You know, you only flop for...

1359
01:38:35,006 --> 01:38:37,634
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.

1360
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,039
Hey, Bert!

1361
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:57,788
If one's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

1362
01:39:10,942 --> 01:39:14,776
So you see, gentlemen,
the grave responsibility rests upon us.

1363
01:39:15,646 --> 01:39:18,706
This entire German salient,
holding up the Argonne advance

1364
01:39:18,783 --> 01:39:21,843
depends for ammunition and supplies
on the Decauville Railroad,

1365
01:39:21,919 --> 01:39:24,615
which as you know,
lies just beyond these hills.

1366
01:39:24,722 --> 01:39:26,019
It must be taken.

1367
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,523
This is all open country ahead,

1368
01:39:27,591 --> 01:39:30,424
but you can expect heavy machinegun fire
from these wooded ridges

1369
01:39:30,494 --> 01:39:34,396
on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.

1370
01:39:34,999 --> 01:39:36,967
Synchronize your watches.

1371
01:39:38,202 --> 01:39:41,137
Use as a mark, 4:32.

1372
01:39:42,206 --> 01:39:45,642
It is now minus 10, eight, six,

1373
01:39:46,143 --> 01:39:48,805
four, two, mark.

1374
01:39:48,879 --> 01:39:49,937
Any questions?

1375
01:39:50,014 --> 01:39:52,141
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?

1376
01:39:52,216 --> 01:39:54,844
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage
at 6:00.

1377
01:39:54,919 --> 01:39:57,046
Zero hour will be 6:10.

1378
01:40:02,126 --> 01:40:05,289
I'd like to know where that barrage is
that we're supposed to have.

1379
01:40:05,363 --> 01:40:10,062
Runners, notify the platoon commanders
that we go over, barrage or no barrage.

1380
01:40:10,134 --> 01:40:11,726
First platoon at 6:10,

1381
01:40:11,802 --> 01:40:14,270
second and third platoons to follow
in waves of 100 meters.

1382
01:40:14,338 --> 01:40:15,600
Yes, sir.

1383
01:40:29,453 --> 01:40:31,353
-6:10.
-6:10. All right.

1384
01:40:51,142 --> 01:40:52,609
Come on, men!

1385
01:43:07,278 --> 01:43:08,768
Halt and take cover!

1386
01:43:21,692 --> 01:43:23,250
We'll never get through.

1387
01:43:25,396 --> 01:43:27,159
We gotta wipe out those nests.

1388
01:43:27,231 --> 01:43:30,962
Early, take what's left of your section
and work your way back around that hill.

1389
01:43:31,035 --> 01:43:32,662
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.

1390
01:43:32,736 --> 01:43:36,672
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.

1391
01:44:07,204 --> 01:44:08,535
Take cover.

1392
01:44:10,808 --> 01:44:11,968
Listen.

1393
01:44:33,497 --> 01:44:34,691
Heinie!

1394
01:44:35,866 --> 01:44:36,992
Listen.

1395
01:44:41,372 --> 01:44:42,737
We're not far enough back.

1396
01:44:42,806 --> 01:44:43,830
Savage, keep the men quiet.

1397
01:44:43,907 --> 01:44:45,966
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.

1398
01:45:11,302 --> 01:45:15,602
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.

1399
01:45:16,473 --> 01:45:17,963
Look! Heinies!

1400
01:45:18,742 --> 01:45:20,334
Come on, get 'em.

1401
01:45:40,464 --> 01:45:41,624
Hold your fire!

1402
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:45,191
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!

1403
01:45:45,903 --> 01:45:47,530
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!

1404
01:45:48,906 --> 01:45:50,533
-Get back there.
-Get 'em up there.

1405
01:45:50,607 --> 01:45:51,835
Go on.

1406
01:46:30,247 --> 01:46:32,545
-I'm hit bad, Cutting.
-Me, too.

1407
01:46:33,484 --> 01:46:34,644
Savage.

1408
01:46:35,619 --> 01:46:36,677
Savage?

1409
01:46:37,287 --> 01:46:38,584
Where's Savage?

1410
01:46:38,989 --> 01:46:41,787
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.

1411
01:46:41,859 --> 01:46:44,020
You're the only noncom left.

1412
01:46:46,363 --> 01:46:48,763
York, take over.

1413
01:46:49,299 --> 01:46:51,995
-Did you hear what I said?
-I heard you.

1414
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:55,131
Watch this fellow.

1415
01:46:55,939 --> 01:46:58,305
The rest of you keep under cover.

1416
01:47:00,177 --> 01:47:01,701
Come back here.

1417
01:47:01,812 --> 01:47:04,838
-Where are you going?
-You done give me command.

1418
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,257
Hey, Alvin!

1419
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:01,731
Well, he cleaned out
that machine gun nest.

1420
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:31,429
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys,

1421
01:48:31,502 --> 01:48:33,970
keep your eye on them Heinies
so they don't try any rough stuff.

1422
01:48:34,037 --> 01:48:35,732
Don't try anything funny.

1423
01:48:35,806 --> 01:48:37,774
Belly to the ground, you babies.

1424
01:48:37,841 --> 01:48:38,865
We better get up there.

1425
01:48:38,942 --> 01:48:41,103
No, we better keep an eye
on these prisoners.

1426
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:56,282
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off
your whole sauerkraut army.

1427
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:58,828
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.

1428
01:48:58,896 --> 01:49:01,228
-Tell him it's useless.
-What did you say?

1429
01:49:01,298 --> 01:49:02,856
I said tell him it's useless.

1430
01:49:02,933 --> 01:49:06,232
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.

1431
01:49:27,391 --> 01:49:29,586
Just like a flock of turkeys.

1432
01:49:54,384 --> 01:49:57,319
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!

1433
01:49:58,922 --> 01:50:00,412
Come this a-way.

1434
01:50:05,495 --> 01:50:08,828
Tell the rest of them fellows
to quit shooting and come on out of there.

1435
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:16,697
Keep 'em hands up
and start a-going down the hill there.

1436
01:50:19,743 --> 01:50:21,108
Keep a-coming.

1437
01:50:23,113 --> 01:50:25,775
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.

1438
01:50:27,985 --> 01:50:29,953
All right. Keep a-coming.

1439
01:50:31,154 --> 01:50:33,645
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.

1440
01:50:33,757 --> 01:50:35,281
All right, get on down!

1441
01:50:37,761 --> 01:50:40,025
Come on out and keep your hands up.

1442
01:50:40,097 --> 01:50:41,655
Boy, I told you.

1443
01:50:47,137 --> 01:50:48,195
Look at that mob.

1444
01:50:48,271 --> 01:50:49,932
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.

1445
01:50:50,007 --> 01:50:51,634
Sure we can. That's my mate.

1446
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:53,972
Come on, step lively. Move forward.

1447
01:50:54,044 --> 01:50:55,409
Get going.

1448
01:50:55,879 --> 01:50:57,972
-Move forward.
-Move it, now.

1449
01:50:59,483 --> 01:51:00,711
Move forward, there.

1450
01:51:00,784 --> 01:51:03,309
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.

1451
01:51:07,324 --> 01:51:09,690
-All right.
-Get those hands up. Get in there.

1452
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,955
-Come on.
-Come on, get going.

1453
01:51:12,029 --> 01:51:13,360
Nice going, York.

1454
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:16,524
-Come on there. Come on.
-Come on, get in there.

1455
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,826
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.

1456
01:51:19,903 --> 01:51:21,962
-Hiya, Pusher.
-That was a good job, pal.

1457
01:51:22,039 --> 01:51:25,304
-Where's the Sergeant?
-Over there. Hurt pretty bad.

1458
01:51:25,942 --> 01:51:28,706
-How many men we got left?
-Eight, besides you.

1459
01:51:31,815 --> 01:51:33,077
Watch them fellows.

1460
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:35,118
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...

1461
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,386
Pusher.

1462
01:51:45,062 --> 01:51:46,290
Pusher.

1463
01:51:46,863 --> 01:51:49,388
This is where we change cars, Alvin.

1464
01:51:51,635 --> 01:51:53,398
The end of the line.

1465
01:52:01,411 --> 01:52:04,073
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?

1466
01:52:09,319 --> 01:52:12,413
Come on, you, put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

1467
01:52:13,757 --> 01:52:15,384
You know what I'm a-saying?

1468
01:52:15,459 --> 01:52:17,051
-You understand?
-Yeah.

1469
01:52:17,127 --> 01:52:19,357
Tell 'em men of yours
if any more of that happens

1470
01:52:19,429 --> 01:52:22,660
you and a lot more of 'em's
going to be mighty sorry.

1471
01:52:22,733 --> 01:52:23,961
Go ahead.

1472
01:52:26,636 --> 01:52:28,331
Tell 'em to drop their belts.

1473
01:52:34,945 --> 01:52:37,038
Look them fellows over good.

1474
01:52:40,383 --> 01:52:42,510
-You ready back there?
-Okay here.

1475
01:52:42,586 --> 01:52:45,077
-Okay. Ready here.
-Watch 'em.

1476
01:52:48,992 --> 01:52:50,391
Now, get going.

1477
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:08,905
Tell 'em to halt.

1478
01:53:11,782 --> 01:53:13,682
If you wanted to get back
to the American lines,

1479
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:16,048
which way would you be a-going?

1480
01:53:16,119 --> 01:53:17,381
Up there.

1481
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:20,448
We'll go this a-way. Go on.

1482
01:53:31,101 --> 01:53:32,966
Hey, tell 'em to halt.

1483
01:53:35,105 --> 01:53:36,163
What's up?

1484
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:39,003
Sounds like them Heinies
is making a heap of trouble.

1485
01:53:41,244 --> 01:53:44,077
-What are we gonna do about it?
-Get 'em.

1486
01:53:44,314 --> 01:53:46,145
We got enough to take care of already.

1487
01:53:46,216 --> 01:53:47,911
And a few more won't make no difference.

1488
01:53:47,984 --> 01:53:49,212
Hey, you.

1489
01:53:49,486 --> 01:53:51,920
Signal up there
and tell 'em they're surrounded.

1490
01:53:51,988 --> 01:53:55,924
Tell 'em to drop their guns
and come down with their hands up.

1491
01:53:57,561 --> 01:54:00,496
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.

1492
01:54:48,645 --> 01:54:50,977
They sure are trained good, Major.

1493
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:54,812
Hey, Sarge, look.

1494
01:54:55,352 --> 01:54:57,513
-Looks like Heinies.
-Stand ready.

1495
01:54:59,589 --> 01:55:01,079
Hello, there!

1496
01:55:01,258 --> 01:55:03,522
-A Yank.
-It may be some kind of a trick.

1497
01:55:03,593 --> 01:55:05,857
-There's something funny here.
-Let 'em get a little closer.

1498
01:55:05,929 --> 01:55:07,863
-Hello there!
-Who are you?

1499
01:55:07,931 --> 01:55:11,298
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.

1500
01:55:12,302 --> 01:55:14,327
-Halt where you are.
-Halt!

1501
01:55:15,305 --> 01:55:16,738
That's a Yank, all right.

1502
01:55:16,806 --> 01:55:20,003
-Come out, let's have a look at you.
-Watch 'em, fellows!

1503
01:55:25,982 --> 01:55:27,609
Keep 'em covered.

1504
01:55:30,387 --> 01:55:31,718
Where you going?

1505
01:55:31,788 --> 01:55:34,416
Can you tell me where the 328th be?

1506
01:55:34,491 --> 01:55:36,083
It's up that way someplace.

1507
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:39,617
-Where did you pick up all this bunch?
-Back up the line a ways.

1508
01:55:39,696 --> 01:55:41,926
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands,
could you?

1509
01:55:41,998 --> 01:55:43,795
What would we do with them?

1510
01:55:44,034 --> 01:55:45,797
Well, I don't rightly know.

1511
01:55:45,869 --> 01:55:47,837
-Can we be going?
-Sure. Go ahead.

1512
01:55:47,904 --> 01:55:49,166
Thank you.

1513
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:51,264
Come on.

1514
01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:52,569
Forward!

1515
01:56:12,062 --> 01:56:13,393
All right. Halt!

1516
01:56:13,463 --> 01:56:15,260
Prisoners, hold right there!

1517
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:18,164
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.

1518
01:56:25,542 --> 01:56:27,271
Beg your pardon, sir.

1519
01:56:27,544 --> 01:56:28,602
Yeah?

1520
01:56:28,678 --> 01:56:32,079
We all got some prisoners,
can we be a-leaving 'em here?

1521
01:56:32,749 --> 01:56:34,740
Put 'em right over there.

1522
01:56:36,252 --> 01:56:37,685
Wait a minute.

1523
01:56:38,688 --> 01:56:39,780
How many have you got?

1524
01:56:39,856 --> 01:56:42,256
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.

1525
01:56:42,325 --> 01:56:45,488
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.

1526
01:56:45,562 --> 01:56:47,655
-Yes, sir, but...
-But what?

1527
01:56:47,831 --> 01:56:52,200
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we
tried to drop 'em off two other places.

1528
01:56:52,268 --> 01:56:54,327
And they ain't but only eight of us
to handle them.

1529
01:56:54,404 --> 01:56:58,704
-You should've brought more men.
-But that's all there were of us, sir.

1530
01:56:59,376 --> 01:57:02,243
You mean to say that you
and seven others captured all that bunch?

1531
01:57:02,312 --> 01:57:05,509
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.

1532
01:57:06,016 --> 01:57:08,007
Well, good Lord.

1533
01:57:08,952 --> 01:57:10,749
I guess we can give you some help.

1534
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:12,754
-Come on, Sergeant.
-Thank you.

1535
01:57:19,362 --> 01:57:22,798
Hey, Sarge! York by himself
captured 132 Germans.

1536
01:57:22,866 --> 01:57:26,597
Guy named York got 132 Heinies
all by his lonesome.

1537
01:57:26,669 --> 01:57:28,864
-How did he do it?
-Must have surrounded him.

1538
01:57:28,938 --> 01:57:31,304
-Guy named York.
-That's what they say.

1539
01:57:31,374 --> 01:57:34,172
Gee, he captured
hundreds of Boche and machine guns.

1540
01:57:34,244 --> 01:57:37,213
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!

1541
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,077
Hey, what's that? How many?

1542
01:57:39,149 --> 01:57:41,344
A whole division and a lot of high officers.

1543
01:57:41,418 --> 01:57:43,818
-I'm telling you, York?
-Who's they?

1544
01:57:43,887 --> 01:57:45,878
Yeah, about half the German army
and a general.

1545
01:57:45,955 --> 01:57:47,320
-I don't know.
-One guy.

1546
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:48,618
How could one guy...

1547
01:57:48,691 --> 01:57:50,921
-Guy named York.
-What's that?

1548
01:57:50,994 --> 01:57:53,326
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.

1549
01:57:53,396 --> 01:57:55,830
And brought them all back. They say...

1550
01:58:01,971 --> 01:58:05,236
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.

1551
01:58:08,678 --> 01:58:11,545
Now, as I understand it, York,
your detail came over that ridge there

1552
01:58:11,614 --> 01:58:13,582
and captured about 30 men,
right down in here.

1553
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,674
Yes, sir.

1554
01:58:14,751 --> 01:58:16,582
Then you were forced to cover
by a machine gun

1555
01:58:16,653 --> 01:58:18,814
that was right up on this other ridge.

1556
01:58:18,888 --> 01:58:20,879
Yes, sir. Right up there.

1557
01:58:21,691 --> 01:58:22,817
Where were you?

1558
01:58:22,892 --> 01:58:26,191
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.

1559
01:58:26,763 --> 01:58:30,893
They was machine-gunning us
pretty heavy, so I worked my way across

1560
01:58:31,334 --> 01:58:34,064
up behind that log there under the hill.

1561
01:58:35,772 --> 01:58:37,569
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,

1562
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:40,541
your being able to cross so much
open ground without being hit?

1563
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:43,636
I reckon the good Lord
was a-protecting me, sir.

1564
01:58:43,713 --> 01:58:45,738
What did you wanna go over there for?

1565
01:58:45,815 --> 01:58:47,578
Well, I figured that was a good place to be

1566
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:50,346
because they had to rear up
and show themselves

1567
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:52,945
in order to shoot at me
and the rest of the boys back here.

1568
01:58:53,022 --> 01:58:54,887
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.

1569
01:58:54,958 --> 01:58:55,982
I see.

1570
01:58:56,059 --> 01:58:59,825
So, I went up the hill,
up around that a-way,

1571
01:59:00,196 --> 01:59:03,893
then worked my way down the ridge
to a place where they was flanked

1572
01:59:03,967 --> 01:59:06,663
and couldn't show themselves
without being hit.

1573
01:59:06,769 --> 01:59:09,329
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.

1574
01:59:09,405 --> 01:59:11,270
How many did you kill?

1575
01:59:12,475 --> 01:59:14,375
I don't rightly know, sir.

1576
01:59:14,444 --> 01:59:16,674
I think Captain Danforth
is familiar with that, sir.

1577
01:59:16,746 --> 01:59:20,182
We counted about 20 bodies altogether
up around there.

1578
01:59:21,184 --> 01:59:23,379
What were your men doing
all this time, Corporal?

1579
01:59:23,453 --> 01:59:24,977
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.

1580
01:59:25,054 --> 01:59:27,955
I was pretty busy
and I reckon they was, too.

1581
01:59:28,158 --> 01:59:31,525
According to the statements of the others,
they were guarding the prisoners

1582
01:59:31,594 --> 01:59:35,086
and couldn't expose themselves
to the fire from the ridge.

1583
01:59:35,165 --> 01:59:38,066
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.

1584
01:59:42,839 --> 01:59:44,101
Corporal.

1585
01:59:45,742 --> 01:59:49,041
-There's something that I'd like to know.
-Yes, sir?

1586
01:59:49,245 --> 01:59:51,907
That night that you reported back to me
at Camp Gordon,

1587
01:59:51,981 --> 01:59:55,246
you as much as told me that you were
quite prepared to die for your country,

1588
01:59:55,318 --> 01:59:56,910
but not to kill.

1589
01:59:58,154 --> 02:00:00,918
What made you
decide to change your mind?

1590
02:00:01,324 --> 02:00:02,757
Well, sir...

1591
02:00:02,859 --> 02:00:05,987
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,
why, it's quite all right.

1592
02:00:06,062 --> 02:00:08,758
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever,
sir.

1593
02:00:08,898 --> 02:00:10,832
But it was this way, Colonel.

1594
02:00:11,234 --> 02:00:13,930
When I started out I felt just like you said.

1595
02:00:14,003 --> 02:00:16,096
But when I hear them
machine guns a-going

1596
02:00:16,172 --> 02:00:18,663
and all them fellows
are dropping around me,

1597
02:00:18,775 --> 02:00:22,836
I figured that them guns
was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,

1598
02:00:22,912 --> 02:00:26,109
and there weren't nothing anybody
could do, but to stop them guns.

1599
02:00:26,182 --> 02:00:28,047
And that's what I done.

1600
02:00:28,685 --> 02:00:31,313
You mean to tell me
that you did it to save lives?

1601
02:00:31,387 --> 02:00:33,855
Yes, sir. That was why.

1602
02:00:36,759 --> 02:00:41,389
Well, York, what you've just told me
is the most extraordinary thing of all.

1603
02:00:43,766 --> 02:00:45,256
Sergeant York!

1604
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,454
Thank you, sir.

1605
02:01:16,633 --> 02:01:19,693
And for conspicuous gallantry
beyond the call of duty,

1606
02:01:19,769 --> 02:01:23,170
you have been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross.

1607
02:01:28,444 --> 02:01:31,936
Sergeant York, I am proud that
you are of the All-American Division.

1608
02:01:32,015 --> 02:01:34,882
It's a privilege to command
such men as you.

1609
02:01:38,888 --> 02:01:40,355
Sergeant York,

1610
02:01:40,423 --> 02:01:44,189
as Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces,

1611
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:46,888
it is my pleasure to confer upon you

1612
02:01:46,963 --> 02:01:49,454
the United States
Congressional Medal of Honor

1613
02:01:49,532 --> 02:01:52,023
for heroism beyond the call of duty.

1614
02:01:54,270 --> 02:01:55,794
Thank you, sir.

1615
02:02:22,699 --> 02:02:24,496
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,

1616
02:02:24,567 --> 02:02:26,467
representative from
your district of Tennessee.

1617
02:02:26,536 --> 02:02:28,663
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.

1618
02:02:28,738 --> 02:02:31,172
And this is Mr. Harrison
from the Tennessee Society.

1619
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,174
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.

1620
02:02:33,242 --> 02:02:35,267
-Thank you.
-This way, Sergeant.

1621
02:02:47,223 --> 02:02:49,817
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?

1622
02:02:49,892 --> 02:02:53,157
Appears like everybody's
having a mighty good time.

1623
02:02:53,429 --> 02:02:55,989
So, Sergeant,
in the name of the people of New York,

1624
02:02:56,065 --> 02:02:58,533
may I present you with this key to our city

1625
02:02:58,601 --> 02:03:01,126
as a token of our very great esteem.

1626
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:03,135
And may God bless you.

1627
02:03:05,475 --> 02:03:06,737
Thank you for what you said,

1628
02:03:06,809 --> 02:03:09,573
and I'm sure grateful to you
for this here key.

1629
02:03:09,645 --> 02:03:12,136
Well, thank you. And thank you all.

1630
02:03:13,950 --> 02:03:17,386
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York
would like to show their appreciation.

1631
02:03:17,453 --> 02:03:19,216
Is there anything we can do for you?

1632
02:03:19,288 --> 02:03:21,313
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.

1633
02:03:21,391 --> 02:03:22,517
And that is?

1634
02:03:22,592 --> 02:03:24,116
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,

1635
02:03:24,193 --> 02:03:28,027
I sure would like to ride on the subway
on the Bronx Express.

1636
02:03:28,498 --> 02:03:29,726
I think we can arrange that.

1637
02:03:34,103 --> 02:03:35,730
Well, here we are.

1638
02:03:40,309 --> 02:03:43,107
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.

1639
02:03:43,179 --> 02:03:45,044
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please.

1640
02:03:45,114 --> 02:03:47,947
If there's anything you require,
all you will have to do is ask for it.

1641
02:03:48,017 --> 02:03:49,917
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1642
02:03:50,987 --> 02:03:53,979
An awful lot of room
for just one fellow here.

1643
02:04:09,539 --> 02:04:12,440
This here is mighty thoughtful of you,
gentlemen.

1644
02:04:12,508 --> 02:04:15,306
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma
for quite a spell.

1645
02:04:15,378 --> 02:04:17,505
So we understand.

1646
02:04:23,686 --> 02:04:25,449
Representative Hull.

1647
02:04:26,556 --> 02:04:28,751
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?

1648
02:04:29,525 --> 02:04:30,924
Put them on.

1649
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:33,526
-Somebody for you, Sergeant.
-Me?

1650
02:04:36,766 --> 02:04:38,131
Thank you.

1651
02:04:41,404 --> 02:04:43,463
Hello. Hello there.

1652
02:04:46,676 --> 02:04:47,768
What?

1653
02:04:49,645 --> 02:04:50,976
Who is it?

1654
02:04:53,749 --> 02:04:55,614
I... I can't hear you.

1655
02:04:56,652 --> 02:04:59,280
-Who is it?
-What's that you're saying?

1656
02:04:59,622 --> 02:05:00,953
I can't hear you.

1657
02:05:01,023 --> 02:05:02,991
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.

1658
02:05:03,059 --> 02:05:04,492
Stand closer, Ma.

1659
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,892
When are you coming home, Alvin?

1660
02:05:07,563 --> 02:05:11,294
I said, when are you coming home?

1661
02:05:14,537 --> 02:05:16,198
Oh, I'm glad, Son.

1662
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:19,430
I'll tell her.

1663
02:05:19,842 --> 02:05:21,503
She's right here.

1664
02:05:22,411 --> 02:05:24,777
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.

1665
02:05:26,749 --> 02:05:29,274
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!

1666
02:05:29,719 --> 02:05:32,244
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.

1667
02:05:32,321 --> 02:05:34,812
He's got this here phone in here now.

1668
02:05:34,891 --> 02:05:37,724
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.

1669
02:05:37,894 --> 02:05:39,885
I can't wait to see you.

1670
02:05:39,962 --> 02:05:43,261
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie,
right away.

1671
02:05:43,766 --> 02:05:44,858
Yeah.

1672
02:05:45,701 --> 02:05:49,068
-Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
-Goodbye, Alvin.

1673
02:05:50,606 --> 02:05:51,664
Bye.

1674
02:06:00,283 --> 02:06:02,513
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.

1675
02:06:02,585 --> 02:06:04,985
-I'm a-thanking you.
-You're welcome, Sergeant.

1676
02:06:30,046 --> 02:06:32,981
Just like the electric signs
down the street.

1677
02:06:35,851 --> 02:06:39,685
How do you like New York, Alvin,
as much as you've seen of it?

1678
02:06:40,323 --> 02:06:42,188
-Mr. Hull?
-Yes, Alvin?

1679
02:06:43,292 --> 02:06:45,260
I wanna be a-going home.

1680
02:06:45,795 --> 02:06:47,262
When do you think I can go?

1681
02:06:47,330 --> 02:06:50,163
-You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
-Yes, sir, I am.

1682
02:06:51,033 --> 02:06:52,591
I've got to get to work.

1683
02:06:52,668 --> 02:06:56,001
Well, as far as that goes,
there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.

1684
02:06:56,072 --> 02:06:57,061
What do you mean?

1685
02:06:57,139 --> 02:06:59,539
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

1686
02:06:59,609 --> 02:07:01,600
You're a pretty famous man now.

1687
02:07:01,677 --> 02:07:04,305
And judging by all these offers
you've been getting,

1688
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:06,610
it seems a lot of people realize it.

1689
02:07:06,682 --> 02:07:08,149
For instance,

1690
02:07:08,618 --> 02:07:11,451
two companies want you
in motion pictures,

1691
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,216
Ziegfeld wants you in an act
in his new Follies.

1692
02:07:14,290 --> 02:07:17,487
And here's an offer to appear
at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.

1693
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:21,587
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer
who wants you to endorse his product.

1694
02:07:21,664 --> 02:07:23,427
What does that mean?

1695
02:07:24,133 --> 02:07:28,661
Well, you've to tell him how much
you like it, how much good it's done you.

1696
02:07:29,305 --> 02:07:32,331
I ain't never ate
any of that there breakfast food.

1697
02:07:32,408 --> 02:07:34,205
Doesn't seem to make any difference.

1698
02:07:34,276 --> 02:07:36,767
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far

1699
02:07:36,846 --> 02:07:39,815
and they amount to around
a quarter of million dollars.

1700
02:07:39,882 --> 02:07:41,941
They're offering me all that money?

1701
02:07:42,018 --> 02:07:44,714
It's just a plain business proposition.

1702
02:07:45,388 --> 02:07:48,516
I sure could do a powerful sight
with that money.

1703
02:07:48,691 --> 02:07:51,182
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...

1704
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:53,490
Here's your chance to get it.

1705
02:07:55,297 --> 02:07:58,858
Are they offering that money
because of what happened over there?

1706
02:07:58,934 --> 02:08:01,368
-Well...
-That's it, ain't it?

1707
02:08:02,705 --> 02:08:04,036
That's it.

1708
02:08:05,441 --> 02:08:07,966
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?

1709
02:08:09,645 --> 02:08:12,011
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.

1710
02:08:12,381 --> 02:08:13,905
I reckon it is.

1711
02:08:14,083 --> 02:08:17,018
Take all the time you want to think it over.

1712
02:08:17,319 --> 02:08:19,651
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.

1713
02:08:19,722 --> 02:08:22,555
I ain't proud of what happened over there.

1714
02:08:22,692 --> 02:08:25,889
What we done in France
was something we had to do.

1715
02:08:25,995 --> 02:08:28,793
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.

1716
02:08:29,765 --> 02:08:33,929
So, the way I figure,
things like that ain't for buying and selling.

1717
02:08:34,036 --> 02:08:35,697
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.

1718
02:08:35,771 --> 02:08:38,865
Would you be a-telling them that
for me, please?

1719
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:41,339
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?

1720
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:48,207
-I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
-Thank you, Mr. Hull.

1721
02:08:54,657 --> 02:08:57,182
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.

1722
02:09:08,938 --> 02:09:10,530
Oh, there he is!

1723
02:09:26,655 --> 02:09:27,849
Alvin!

1724
02:09:27,923 --> 02:09:29,481
Oh, Alvin!

1725
02:09:30,059 --> 02:09:31,253
How are you?

1726
02:09:52,915 --> 02:09:54,382
Ma, I'm back.

1727
02:09:55,384 --> 02:09:57,614
I'm right glad, Son.

1728
02:10:00,689 --> 02:10:03,123
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?

1729
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:06,486
-What about 'em, George?
-I thought you'd be wearing 'em.

1730
02:10:06,562 --> 02:10:07,790
You'll be a-seeing 'em.

1731
02:10:07,863 --> 02:10:10,297
They better be a-something big.

1732
02:10:10,533 --> 02:10:11,864
As I was saying, Alvin,

1733
02:10:11,934 --> 02:10:15,370
of course, I always figured
on marrying you and Gracie myself,

1734
02:10:15,437 --> 02:10:18,372
but I ain't one to take the job away
from the Governor of the State.

1735
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:21,102
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero
raised in these parts

1736
02:10:21,177 --> 02:10:22,940
since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.

1737
02:10:23,012 --> 02:10:24,377
Sure are, Alvin.

1738
02:10:25,047 --> 02:10:26,571
Hang on, Rosie.

1739
02:10:28,884 --> 02:10:29,908
Hey,

1740
02:10:30,452 --> 02:10:33,979
what about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?

1741
02:10:34,056 --> 02:10:36,547
-It's still there, I reckon?
-Yep, it's still there.

1742
02:10:36,625 --> 02:10:39,185
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.

1743
02:10:39,261 --> 02:10:43,322
Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb
to hold it for me all this time.

1744
02:10:43,399 --> 02:10:45,765
I sure would like to see that there
piece of land, though.

1745
02:10:45,835 --> 02:10:48,065
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.

1746
02:10:48,137 --> 02:10:50,230
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.

1747
02:10:50,806 --> 02:10:54,264
I'll let you off at the fork and
you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.

1748
02:10:55,678 --> 02:10:57,339
Hang on, everyone.

1749
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:02,474
Hey, look here.

1750
02:11:04,286 --> 02:11:08,017
-Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
-Yeah, they have.

1751
02:11:08,858 --> 02:11:11,292
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.

1752
02:11:11,861 --> 02:11:13,726
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.

1753
02:11:13,796 --> 02:11:16,458
There's something we got to talk about.

1754
02:11:16,599 --> 02:11:19,762
-Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
-What about, Alvin?

1755
02:11:19,835 --> 02:11:21,700
Well, what with the governor fixing
to marry us

1756
02:11:21,770 --> 02:11:23,465
and all them people coming here
from all over...

1757
02:11:23,539 --> 02:11:26,997
Sure takes a body's breath away,
but I reckon we'll get through it all right.

1758
02:11:27,076 --> 02:11:30,443
-Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
-Well, what then?

1759
02:11:30,512 --> 02:11:34,710
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing
to offer you excepting a big wedding.

1760
02:11:34,783 --> 02:11:37,047
Why, some girls don't even get that.

1761
02:11:37,553 --> 02:11:40,647
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep,
wouldn't you?

1762
02:11:40,723 --> 02:11:42,190
Oh, I don't know.

1763
02:11:42,258 --> 02:11:44,522
I done a heap of sleeping
while you was away.

1764
02:11:44,593 --> 02:11:47,653
You sure ain't expecting
too much of a husband.

1765
02:11:47,897 --> 02:11:49,990
I'm expecting my husband to love me.

1766
02:11:50,065 --> 02:11:52,590
I reckon the good Lord
will take care of the rest.

1767
02:11:52,668 --> 02:11:55,159
Well, looks like he's done a heap already,

1768
02:11:55,237 --> 02:11:57,228
just a-having you. But...

1769
02:11:57,473 --> 02:12:01,102
Well, I was expecting to take over
from here myself.

1770
02:12:01,176 --> 02:12:03,770
I reckon you'll get to do your share.

1771
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:07,144
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.

1772
02:12:07,683 --> 02:12:08,672
We got to wait.

1773
02:12:08,751 --> 02:12:12,050
Maybe in another two or three years,
if you're willing to wait...

1774
02:12:12,121 --> 02:12:13,986
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.

1775
02:12:14,056 --> 02:12:17,685
-You mean you won't wait?
-There ain't no need of waiting.

1776
02:12:18,127 --> 02:12:21,756
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down
and don't you be looking up till I tell you.

1777
02:12:22,765 --> 02:12:23,993
Come on.

1778
02:12:29,972 --> 02:12:31,963
There! Now you can look.

1779
02:12:32,608 --> 02:12:34,940
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.

1780
02:12:35,210 --> 02:12:38,179
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.

1781
02:12:38,247 --> 02:12:41,080
The people of the state of Tennessee
for what you done.

1782
02:12:41,150 --> 02:12:43,084
-You mean...
-Only, it's 200 acres

1783
02:12:43,152 --> 02:12:47,213
and the house is bigger, with more
windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.

1784
02:12:47,890 --> 02:12:49,482
And it's for us.

1785
02:12:55,064 --> 02:12:57,897
The Lord sure does move
in mysterious ways.

1786
02:12:59,234 --> 02:13:00,462
Come on.
