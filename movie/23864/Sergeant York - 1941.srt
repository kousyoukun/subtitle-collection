1
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,645
"And he spake this parable
unto them saying,

2
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,709
"What man of you having a hundred sheep,

3
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,220
"if you lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety-nine, and..."

4
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,656
"Doth not leave the ninety-nine
in the wilderness,

5
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,563
"and go after that which was lost, until..."

6
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,937
"Until he find it."

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,101
"And when he hath found it, he layeth it,

8
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,145
"on his shoulder and rejoiceth.

9
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,941
"And when he cometh..."

10
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,444
All right, Zeke, sit yourself down.

11
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,386
"And when he cometh home
he calleth together his friends

12
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,945
"and neighbors saying..."

13
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,891
"He calleth to his friends and neighbors,

14
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,464
"saying unto them, 'Rejoice with me,

15
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,399
"'for I have found my sheep
which were lost."'

16
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,669
I recollect the time Sam Harkness
lost his old sow.

17
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,308
He come out one morning,

18
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,141
the pen be busted down,
the sow was gone.

19
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,580
Sam lit out after it to find it.

20
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,381
He had six or seven other pigs
that didn't run off.

21
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,256
But did Sam get down
on his marrowbones,

22
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,690
and thank the good Lord for that?

23
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,195
No, siree, not Sam.

24
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,857
He hunted high and low for that old...

25
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,098
As I was saying,

26
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,040
he hunted high and low for that old sow.

27
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,274
About all he...

28
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,590
About all he done that summer
was hunt for that sow.

29
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,366
Wouldn't even stop...

30
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,463
Wouldn't even stop hunting
when winter come.

31
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,838
And sure enough, one night,
when he was plowing home...

32
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,005
One night, when he was plowing home
through the snow,

33
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,673
he seen something move in the shadows.

34
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,751
Sam... Sam's right scared.

35
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,480
Figures maybe it's a bear.

36
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,289
Then the...

37
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,024
Then the...

38
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,993
Then the bear grunts
and it ain't no bear at all.

39
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,529
It's the sow!

40
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,192
Well, Sam was fitting to be tied.

41
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,359
The rejoicingest man you ever seen.

42
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:07,065
Ten times as rejoiceful for the lost one
as for 'em that stayed in the fold.

43
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,765
Now this here...

44
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,000
Now this here...

45
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,236
Now this here is the point!

46
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,752
It appears to me that
the devil be a-knocking at the

47
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
door of the house of worship.

48
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,598
If there's any of you
want to go get him, you're...

49
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,464
You'll be free to go.

50
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,564
'Cause the meeting's over.

51
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,934
Lookee here, Pastor Pile.

52
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,276
Alvin York done shot his initials
in this tree.

53
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,213
"A-Y," plain as day.

54
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,250
It was Alvin York, lke Botkin
and Buck Lipscomb in their liquor.

55
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,480
Who was you saying it was?

56
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,451
Who was you saying it was?

57
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,992
- It was Alvin, Mrs. York.
- How be you know it?

58
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,999
It wasn't Alvin, Mother York,
it was the liquor.

59
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,973
Mighty good shooting
for a man in his liquor.

60
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,006
Ain't it?

61
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,462
Say, let's do it again.

62
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,773
- Howdy, boys!
- Howdy!

63
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,201
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Luke.

64
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,406
- We were looking for you Saturday.
- Couldn't get here no more than fly.

65
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,382
Roads are getting soggier and soggier
between here and Rugby.

66
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,850
- Is that so?
- Water is so deep

67
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,049
in some of 'em creek beds,
had to use old Betsy's belly for a boat.

68
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,147
How are you, Zeke?

69
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,284
I reckon you could have got here quicker
if you had carried Betsy.

70
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,625
Yeah, wished I could get me another mule
like old Flora.

71
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,597
They ain't turning out mules
like they used to.

72
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,860
No, sir!

73
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,834
Hey, what you got there, young fellow?

74
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,133
The very latest thing in ladies' hats,
the cloche model.

75
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,174
Women folks around here
wear split bonnets.

76
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,868
The young ones goes bareheaded.

77
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,843
Maybe so, but in modern merchandising,

78
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,607
the storekeeper endeavors
to create a demand.

79
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,876
Now in this line of ladies' bloomers,

80
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,886
very moderately priced,
has the finest elastic in the waistband,

81
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,781
also in the knees.

82
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,154
No amount of washing
will make it lose its snap.

83
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,660
- Your first trip in these parts, ain't it?
- Yes.

84
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,787
And we have them in three lovely colors.

85
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,300
Which we absolutely guarantee
will not fade or shrink.

86
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,525
Plenty of room in the seat, too.

87
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,232
I can tell you these garments
are mighty popular with the ladies.

88
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,771
- You can, huh?
- Yes.

89
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,309
Well, folks hereabouts wouldn't know
what 'em things is for.

90
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,401
- Lem?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,742
- Lem, here's your Nashville paper.
- Well, thank you, Pastor.

92
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,339
I got letters here for Tom Carver
and Ed Watson.

93
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,145
Both back tax bills, I reckon.

94
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,449
- What does it say, Lem?
- Well...

95
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,052
They're a-telling, Cordell Hull
are speechmaking over in Jimtown.

96
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,231
Appears he's out running
for Congress again.

97
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,461
- It says...
- I mind when Cord Hull

98
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,561
wasn't knee high to a toad frog,

99
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,572
and running around in his shirttail.

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,132
Just goes to show you what
a fellow can do if he gets book learning.

101
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,872
That paper is four days old,
I read it over at Nashville.

102
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,073
Yep. It took Luke three days
of mule-paddling

103
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,775
to bring the mail from Rugby.

104
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,580
I can believe that,
after driving over here from Jamestown.

105
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,915
Jimtown.

106
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,613
- I thought it was Jamestown.
- It are.

107
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,461
Well, anyway, since driving over here,

108
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,832
what I'd like to know is,
how do you fellows get into this valley?

109
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,868
We were born here.

110
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,406
Now look, Mr. Pile,

111
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,136
I'd like to sell you some of these garments

112
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,235
before the price goes up
on account of the war.

113
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,575
What war?

114
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,075
Why, the... The war in Europe.

115
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,546
Oh, that war.

116
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,191
Yes, certainly.

117
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,653
Look likes the Germans
might get into Paris, don't you think?

118
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,756
Well, we ain't done
much thinking on it, mister.

119
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,630
It ain't in our corner, nohow.

120
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,499
If you're hankering for trouble,

121
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,765
it ain't scarce
right here in these mountains.

122
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,399
Oh, I ain't looking for any trouble.

123
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,974
Yep, fighting could have been
mighty plentiful

124
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,070
down at the meeting house last night.
Did you hear?

125
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,639
Alvin York and two other fellows
done busted up the meeting.

126
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,653
That ain't a smithereen
to what he done in Jimtown.

127
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,053
- Nigh split the jail, he did.
- No...

128
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,216
Raised such a rumpus
they had to turn him loose.

129
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,350
Do tell.

130
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,792
Old man Jarvis up Bear Creek way

131
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,126
told me he seen the three of 'em
riding their mules,

132
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,530
hell-bent for election,
toward the Kentucky border.

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,090
I reckon their liquor was getting low

134
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,035
and they wanted to get there
before they sobered up.

135
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,603
Howdy, Mrs. York.

136
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,147
- Howdy, Luke.
- Howdy, Mother York.

137
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,647
- Tolerable, Pastor.
- What can I do for you today?

138
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,414
Could I be getting a can of baking powder
and a...

139
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,351
- Poke of salt?
- Sure thing.

140
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:14,400
I ain't having but five eggs
and they're kind of puny.

141
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,633
Oh, eggs are eggs, I reckon.

142
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,078
I was plumb out of salt.

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,913
Don't be taking it hard, Mother York,
what you just heard.

144
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,912
I ain't taking nothing hard, Pastor.

145
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,255
And I ain't making excuses
for Alvin to nobody.

146
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,988
Of course you ain't,
and I ain't asking you to.

147
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,123
- I'm right proud of Alvin.
- Got a right to be.

148
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,969
Works hard, Alvin does.

149
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,173
Patching and scratching that poor land.

150
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,603
It's mighty hard work,
getting corn out of rocks.

151
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,543
- Indeed it is.
- Who's to blame him

152
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,975
if he busts loose now and again?

153
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,820
Nobody, Mother York, nary a soul.

154
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,985
Of course, I ain't for Alvin

155
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,357
doing like he does.

156
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,260
A little religion wouldn't do him no hurt.

157
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,969
No, it wouldn't.

158
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:25,375
Pastor, I wouldn't be against
your talking to Alvin.

159
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,573
You reckon it'd do any good?

160
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,051
Well, it wouldn't do no harm.

161
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,454
I'd be riding up and having a talk with him.

162
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,848
I'm thanking you, Pastor.

163
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,135
- George.
- Yes, Ma?

164
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,143
I reckon I know where your brother's at.

165
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,681
He's up at the Kentucky border.

166
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,852
- Go fetch him.
- Yessum.

167
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,334
Better be taking a piece of corn
for your supper, Son.

168
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,630
Yessum.

169
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,514
- Hiya, Marter.
- Hiya, Alvin.

170
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,820
- Mart, we wants to get us a bottle.
- Now look here, Alvin.

171
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,391
You know, I know and so do the Sheriff.
You're from over here in Tennessee.

172
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,957
And I can't sell you no liquor
less you gets over yonder in Kentucky.

173
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,939
Marter, you are the legalest fellow in
these here parts, if you ain't nothing else.

174
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,406
You gotta be, in this business.

175
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,342
Maybe our credit ain't no good
in Tennessee.

176
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,369
Bet it ain't no better in Kentuck.

177
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,639
What you be having, Alvin?

178
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,208
You got any corn without no lye in it?

179
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,254
No poison oak leaves in it, either.

180
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,449
Ain't no lye in this liquor.

181
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,823
Plumb hollow I am,
like an old, burnt-out stump.

182
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,420
Me, too.

183
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,463
What are we drinking to, Alvin?

184
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,795
What'll we drink to, lke?

185
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,597
Why, I reckon we drunk
to pretty near everything there is.

186
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,543
- I can't think of nothing new.
- Me neither.

187
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,913
Reckon we better begin all over?

188
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,014
If we can't drink to something,

189
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,346
why don't we drink against something?

190
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,219
Against something? Against what?

191
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,727
Oh, against something
or somebody we're against.

192
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,855
I ain't against nobody or nothing.
Except getting sober.

193
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,031
We'll drink against that.

194
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,501
You... You'll be a-killing
two birds with one stone.

195
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,596
- Come on. Sure.
- Ain't never gonna get sober.

196
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,083
Never gonna get...

197
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,887
Well, I'll be blowed.

198
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,190
What are you doing here, George?

199
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,857
Young'uns like you ain't got no business
in a place like this here, nohow.

200
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,231
- Now just you skedaddle.
- Ma wants you home.

201
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,367
- Now look here, George...
- Ma wants you.

202
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,001
- Shucks, son of a gun...
- Well,

203
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,839
reckon I better go. I'll be seeing you.

204
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,279
His ma wants him.

205
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,156
Get up.

206
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,130
Here, here. Quit that.

207
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,292
Hold your horses, Marter.

208
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,612
Here we go.

209
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,716
Here we go again.

210
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,887
I'm still a-coming.

211
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,159
Say when you got enough.

212
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,788
Say it.

213
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,121
Enough, enough.

214
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,403
Ma wants you, Alvin.

215
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,044
Ma wants you.

216
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,374
Coming, George.

217
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,196
- I'll be seeing you.
- So long, Al.

218
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,345
Here he is, Ma.

219
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,723
It took a heap of looking,
but he come easy.

220
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,127
- Fetch me a pail of water, George.
- Yessum.

221
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,766
Breakfast's ready, now it is.
Better be getting at it.

222
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,502
South field needs a-plowing.

223
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,021
The Lord bless these victuals we done got

224
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,694
and help us to be
beholding to nobody. Amen.

225
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,837
I reckon you'll want some salt
on your pone.

226
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,081
Whoa, Fred.

227
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,493
Giddap, Noah.

228
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:36,992
Whoa.

229
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,132
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Alvin.

230
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,506
I've been kind of expecting you.

231
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,645
I'm right sorry about the other night, I...

232
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,680
I reckon I done the wrong thing.

233
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,682
See that rock, Alvin?

234
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,352
You've been plowing around that rock
a heap of years.

235
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,054
Sure have.

236
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,850
Did you ever think when you start plowing
your furrows crooked,

237
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,795
it's mighty hard to get 'em straight again.

238
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,866
- I never thought on it much.
- It's that a-way, I reckon,

239
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,437
with other things besides plowing.

240
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,837
Satan's got you by the shirttail, Alvin.

241
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,044
Sure has. Giddap, Noah.

242
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,512
He's gonna yank you straight down to hell.

243
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,980
You are plum right, Pastor.

244
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,847
You gotta make him let loose of you
before it's too late.

245
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,283
I sure wish I know'd how.

246
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,651
Wrestle him, Alvin,
wrestle him like you would a bear.

247
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,180
I done wrestled him, Pastor, but...
Whoa, whoa there, Noah.

248
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,291
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, Noah.

249
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,960
But old Satan, he hangs on tight.

250
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,794
You and the Lord could throw him, Alvin.

251
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,699
Why, twixt the two of you,
you'd have old Satan down in a jiffy.

252
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,999
Why, I sure wish the Lord would throw in.

253
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,005
He will, if you ask him.

254
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,767
Oh, I done prayed, Pastor,
till I was black in the face.

255
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:59,211
- But it wasn't no use.
- It ain't only praying, Alvin, it's believing.

256
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,911
Now, you see here.

257
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,989
Take a look at the old oak yonder.
Looks mighty strong.

258
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,925
Been standing there since your pa
was a boy a-plowing in the same field.

259
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,792
Looks like it could go right on standing
all by itself, don't it?

260
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,921
Yep.

261
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,058
Just a-resting itself
and feeding on the earth.

262
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,929
Well, it can't. It can't stand there

263
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,201
without there's a lot of deep roots
a-holding it up.

264
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,641
Can't see the roots,
but they're there just the same.

265
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,506
It appears to me it's been planned
a fellow's got to have his roots

266
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,014
in something outside his own self.

267
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,684
I reckon I ain't found no roots
what'll hold me up, when...

268
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,445
When I'm hell-bent to fall.

269
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,888
And then take the animals in the woods.

270
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,357
Squirrels'd go mighty hungry

271
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,054
if nothing made 'em store up nuts
for the wintertime.

272
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,221
- Sure would.
- How do you reckon

273
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,131
birds get to fly north in the summer
if there ain't something a-guiding 'em?

274
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,170
A bird ain't got no way of telling
north from south.

275
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,034
And then there's the bees.

276
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,573
Bees'd sure be in a fix
if they wasn't beholding to something

277
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,235
to show 'em how to get back to the hives.

278
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,405
Well, I ain't no bird and I ain't no squirrel.

279
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,575
- And I sure ain't no bee.
- Well, that's right, Alvin.

280
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,451
The way I figure, there ain't no use for a
fellow going out looking for religion. It's...

281
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,217
Well, it's just gotta come to a fellow.

282
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,417
It'll come, my boy. You'll see.

283
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,961
Maybe slow, like the way daylight comes.

284
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,088
And maybe in a flash,
like a bolt of lightning.

285
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,631
- When?
- When you ain't even expecting it.

286
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,435
Well, I hope so.

287
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,005
Giddap, Noah. I'll be seeing you.

288
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,864
Get after him, now.

289
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,809
Tracks are mighty fresh.
Less than an hour old.

290
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,175
- Reckon it's a red fox?
- Might be red and might be gray.

291
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,645
It's making a big circle.

292
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,841
Can't tell about his course
till he gets out on the flat.

293
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,841
They took to the hill there.
Yeah, that-a-way.

294
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,844
What's the matter, Alvin?

295
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,353
Howdy.

296
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,496
- You're Alvin York, ain't you?
- Yes.

297
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,156
Let's get going, Alvin.

298
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:08,104
I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
Where you been keeping yourself?

299
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,970
- Hereabouts.
- What's ailing you?

300
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,906
Are you coming or ain't you?

301
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,377
You better go get that fox, George.

302
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,243
You're just tetched.

303
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,306
How's your ma?

304
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,312
I asked you how your ma was.

305
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,486
Tolerable.

306
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,354
I figured it was you out a-hunting.

307
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,987
No mistaking the voices
of 'em hound dogs.

308
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,963
One's a-having a hook to the end of its bay

309
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,159
you could be hanging a bucket on.

310
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:41,194
The other's a croak, just like a frog,
about moonrise.

311
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,942
- What...
- You ain't Gracie Williams, are you?

312
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,968
Well, I ain't nobody but.

313
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,304
Why, you was only just...

314
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,250
You sure growed up all of a sudden like...

315
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,021
Reckon I have.

316
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,025
Sounds as if they've run that fox
to ground.

317
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,797
I said 'em hound dogs
run the fox to ground.

318
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,258
You better be getting along.

319
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,869
Reckon I had.

320
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,035
- I'll be seeing you.
- Hoping.

321
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,006
Ma.

322
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,178
Yeah?

323
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,887
When you and Pa got hitched,
what did Pa have to set up with?

324
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,926
Well, your pa had this here farm

325
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:14,393
and a mule and $5, no $6.

326
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,798
What did Grandpa have?

327
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,165
Your grandpa had this here farm,
a pair of horses.

328
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,840
The mare was in foal.

329
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,340
I reckon I wouldn't, George.

330
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,813
Ma.

331
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,490
It's sure ripped down here.
You reckon you can fix it?

332
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,429
I reckon. Come over here, Alvin.

333
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,732
Bend over.

334
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,603
You're a-figuring on setting up,
ain't you, Son?

335
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,670
- Yessum.
- Getting married?

336
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,770
- Who's it gonna be?
- Gracie Williams.

337
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,807
Gracie Williams?

338
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,246
Asked her yet?

339
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,322
No, I ain't.

340
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,823
What's the matter?

341
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,927
I ain't said nothing.

342
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,531
Reckon that'll hold.

343
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,963
Reckon it better.

344
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,651
Hold it thataway, Zeb.

345
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:49,660
Thinking on going to that there shindig
next Saturday night, Miss Gracie?

346
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,122
- I ain't been asked.
- Well...

347
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,465
You've been asked now.

348
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,734
- I can't say, Zeb. I have to think it over.
- Well, I don't...

349
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,035
Joshua, 14, verse 9...

350
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,037
You'd be a-coming if you wanted to,
Miss Gracie.

351
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,605
Maybe I could and maybe I couldn't.

352
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,782
Why, it's Alvin York.

353
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,253
- Howdy, Miss Gracie.
- Howdy, Alvin.

354
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,020
- You know Zeb Andrews, ain't you?
- Howdy.

355
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,484
Knitting, Zeb?

356
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,929
He was just a-helping me.

357
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,199
I wasn't expecting you
to be a-calling so soon.

358
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,567
Well, I said I'd be seeing you.

359
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,340
Last time I seen Alvin
he was chasing a fox.

360
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,737
He stopped here for a spell to

361
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,669
kind of catch his breath.

362
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,174
- Did you kill that fox, Alvin?
- I sure did.

363
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,152
- We run over there...
- Was that a gray fox or a red?

364
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,910
Red. Just to the side of that...

365
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,981
Why, a red fox skin ain't worth nothing
this time of the year.

366
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,923
That little hollow...

367
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,427
This one was.

368
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:03,493
"Asa begat Joshiat
and Joshiat begat Joshua."

369
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,298
It's just Uncle Lige talking to himself.

370
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,070
Zeb here was telling me there's gonna be
a dance over to Thomson's Mill.

371
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,199
Yeah, I hear that...

372
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,676
Ed Morgan's gonna do the fiddling.

373
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,902
I was figuring that...

374
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,971
Just about the best fiddler
in these here parts, he is.

375
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,449
- He ain't.
- Lf he ain't, who'd be?

376
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,453
- Tod Haskins.
- He can't hold a candle to Ed.

377
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,949
- You're a-thinking.
- I'm a-knowing.

378
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,156
- Oh, you are, are you?
- Now, now, now. Hush up, you two.

379
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,719
There ain't no call
for fussing over a fiddler.

380
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,664
- We weren't a-fussing. I was telling him...
- Well, I'm a-telling you...

381
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:40,227
The way I figure, Ed's better at the jigging
and Tod can sure fiddle a square.

382
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,901
"It biteth like a serpent,
and stingeth like an adder."

383
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,213
Uncle Lige there was a-telling me
that corn's right good this harvest.

384
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,442
How's the crops up your way, Alvin?

385
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,418
We figure to get about
20 bushel to the acre.

386
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,386
We're gonna get about 60.

387
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,850
Well, there's a heap of difference

388
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,618
twixt farming the bottomland and the top.

389
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,785
- Well, there sure is.
- I reckon...

390
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,796
You know, I don't see how you get
five bushels off of that there land of yours.

391
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,958
Now look here, Zeb Andrews...

392
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,966
Miss... Miss Gracie,

393
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,040
I'd sure be much obliged
if I could have a cup of water.

394
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,633
I got some nipping cider.

395
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,908
- Well, that'd go mighty good.
- I'll be getting it.

396
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,548
"And the lion shall lie down
with the lamb."

397
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,605
Here's your cider. It's coming from the...

398
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,247
Where's Zeb?

399
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,382
- What's he...
- I reckon he lit out.

400
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,582
Well, isn't he be coming back?

401
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,190
No, ma'am, he ain't.

402
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,625
- That strikes me mighty queer.
- Yessum.

403
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,699
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

404
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,664
"do it with thy might."

405
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,710
Alvin, you...

406
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,037
You was fighting.

407
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,278
- It weren't much.
- Alvin York...

408
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,876
You ain't a-fitting to come a-visiting a girl.

409
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,716
He ain't got no business
around here anyhow.

410
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,847
As much business as you have, Alvin York.

411
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,823
- No, he ain't.
- Well, why ain't he?

412
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,053
- Well, he ain't because...
- Because, why?

413
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,359
Because...
Because I'm a-going to marry you.

414
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,223
- You what?
- I'm a-going to marry you.

415
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,971
Now, now, now, Alvin, you stop that.
Don't you be saying things like that.

416
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,837
- Don't you be saying 'em.
- Well, I have.

417
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,274
It ain't...

418
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,478
- Oh, you are, are you?
- Yessum.

419
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,241
Well, you can't...

420
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,440
- Well, your mother told me about it.
- That's what I'm a-doing.

421
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,312
Well, I never... Lookee here...

422
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,348
I wouldn't have you on a Christmas tree,
Alvin York.

423
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,959
Fine husband you'd make.

424
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,462
I allow Zeb Andrews would make
a better one?

425
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,930
Oh, how should I know? Maybe he would.

426
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,698
Zeb Andrews got a piece of bottomland,
that's it, ain't it?

427
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,671
You thinking that's it, aren't you?

428
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,644
Folks say you're no good
except for fighting and hell raising

429
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,044
and I'm thinking they're plumb right.

430
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,343
If I had a piece of bottomland,

431
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,441
I'd guess it'd make a heap of difference,
wouldn't it?

432
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,611
- A piece of bottomland!
- Well, I can get some.

433
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,678
Well, go and get it. I ain't a-caring.

434
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,214
There ain't nothing I can't get
if I set my mind to it.

435
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,817
You don't think much of yourself, do you?

436
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,795
Yes, I do.

437
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,456
Amen.

438
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,907
That there's bottomland soil, ain't it?

439
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,448
Queer how the folks
that lives on the bottom

440
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,809
looks down on the folks on top.

441
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,622
It was always that way.

442
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,190
Ain't no changing it.

443
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,197
Well, I'm a-gonna change it.

444
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,958
I'm a-gonna get us a piece of bottomland.

445
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,399
Your pa set out to get hisself
a piece of bottomland once.

446
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,031
Nary a man ever tried harder.

447
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,073
Liked to kill hisself trying.

448
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,216
It was a long time before he gave up,

449
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,515
but he had to in the end.

450
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,624
Well, I ain't a-setting myself up
as a better man than Pa.

451
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,957
I reckon I ain't half as good,

452
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,231
but I'm a-knowing where there's
a piece of bottomland to be had

453
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,264
and I'm a-gonna get it.

454
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,197
Maybe you will.

455
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,410
How old you say this here mule be?

456
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,814
- Nine year, but Abraham's sound.
- Yes, he are.

457
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,120
He's kind of pussle-gutted,
it appears to me.

458
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,091
Nary a bit.
He's just mighty well fed, that's all.

459
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,421
Well...

460
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,991
I reckon I might allow you $30 on him.

461
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,623
- $30?
- Yeah.

462
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,224
- You say $30?
- Yeah.

463
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,736
Well, he's worth $40 if he's worth a cent.

464
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,601
Then he ain't worth a cent.

465
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,367
- What's all this here you got?
- Well, there's two dozen pullets.

466
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,769
$6.

467
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,478
Why, that's 25 cents apiece.
They're worth twice that much.

468
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,109
Not to me, they ain't.

469
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,383
- What are these?
- Them's prime winter pelts, Mr. Tomkins.

470
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,356
Mighty poor. They won't fetch that much.

471
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,028
I might allow you $1.50 apiece for 'em.

472
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,621
Well, I can get $3 apiece for 'em
in Jimtown.

473
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,826
It's quite a-ways to Jimtown.

474
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,597
Let's see now. That's $40.50.

475
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,066
- What else you got?
- Well, there's

476
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,131
two sacks of rabbit skins,

477
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,144
this here clock
and a sack of goose feathers.

478
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,174
I tell you, Alvin,

479
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,053
I'll give you 50 United States dollars
for the whole caboodle.

480
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,149
- $50 for everything?
- That's the best I can do.

481
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,696
- Sounds like an awful little.
- Take it or leave it.

482
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,259
Can you... Can you do any better
on the price of the land?

483
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,096
Not a cent. $120.

484
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,693
- How much time I got to pay for the rest?
- Sixty days.

485
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,262
Well, it's a bargain. I'll take it.

486
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,540
Well, then I reckon
we can put it in writing.

487
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,040
You understand now, don't you, Alvin?

488
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,845
If I don't get my money afore the 60 days,

489
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:12,355
you lose the whole caboodle
and you don't get the land.

490
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,325
Now, $70 is a lot of money
for a fellow like you to get his hands on.

491
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,294
It's more than a dollar a day.

492
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,490
Now then, 60 days is all you got.

493
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,898
Sixty days and sixty nights.

494
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,798
What?

495
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,500
Well, the way I figure,

496
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:34,908
if I count the nights, too, I got
nigh onto four months to pay you off.

497
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,806
Well, that's one way of figuring it.

498
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,210
Well, I'll tell you.

499
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,278
I was figuring on taking
'em rocks out myself, Alvin.

500
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,917
But if you're willing to take on the job
at 75 cents a day,

501
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,153
- well, I...
- I'll take it.

502
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,161
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:55,488
Well, I tell you. I was thinking
maybe I could shoe your mules for you.

504
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,620
Sorry, Alvin. Had 'em shod
just yesterday over to Possum Trot.

505
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:03,292
Might give you two, three days
work though, splitting rails.

506
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,800
That's good.

507
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,085
Oh, I reckon it's worth about...

508
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,857
- $3.
- $3?

509
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,421
Why, that's a right fair price, Pastor.

510
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,862
I only worked two days to get it.

511
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,989
It's worth it

512
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,361
to me.

513
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,268
All right, George, let him go.

514
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,806
Giddap, Noah, giddap. Come on.

515
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,967
- Giddap, Noah.
- Giddap, Noah.

516
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,271
Come on, Noah.

517
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,173
Come on.

518
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,860
Whoa, Noah.

519
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,092
What... Why, Miss Gracie,

520
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,867
I was thinking you was to the dance.

521
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,430
No. I ain't at the dance.

522
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,576
No. No, I can see that.

523
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,977
Alvin, I...

524
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:24,903
Yeah?

525
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,482
- Alvin, I just...
- Yeah?

526
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,776
I...

527
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,616
Alvin...

528
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,732
That's what I was wanting to tell you.

529
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,546
Giddap, Noah.

530
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,288
Lord...

531
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,123
Lord, if you can,

532
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,332
help him to be getting his land.

533
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,761
Amen.

534
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,132
All right, George.

535
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,502
Again.

536
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,572
Again.

537
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,277
Gotta get under there.

538
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,063
It ain't no use, George.

539
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,358
I can't do it.

540
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,896
- Yes, you can.
- I tell you, I can't do it!

541
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,871
My time's up tomorrow night!

542
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,649
There ain't enough money
for the bottomland.

543
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,052
I can't get the rest!

544
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,051
How?

545
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,193
How am I gonna do it?

546
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,384
- Howdy, Alvin.
- Mr. Tomkins, I've got to talk to you.

547
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,752
Well, I reckon it's money
what talks the loudest.

548
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,313
You got the rest of your payment?

549
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,757
- Well, no, I ain't got it all.
- That's bad.

550
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,729
- But I can get it for you by Saturday.
- Saturday ain't Tuesday.

551
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,264
All I'm asking is, is for four extra days.

552
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,563
How can I be sure
you'll get it by Saturday?

553
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:09,163
Well, there's a beef and turkey shoot
coming up. You must've heard about it.

554
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,503
- Yeah.
- I'm aiming to cut five targets

555
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:14,135
and win the beef critter
and then put him up for cash money.

556
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,076
- It ain't likely.
- Oh, yes, it is.

557
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,081
- That'll take some shooting, Alvin.
- But I could do it.

558
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,312
Well, I'd like to do you a favor, Alvin, but...

559
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,375
Will you?

560
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,547
There's another fellow
asking for that land.

561
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,147
- You ain't letting him have it.
- I don't know.

562
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,524
I was telling him
your option was up Tuesday and...

563
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:35,827
But I got to have 'em extra days,
Mr. Tomkins. I just got to.

564
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,027
Well, I oughtn't to do it,

565
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,799
but I reckon he can wait till Saturday.

566
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,604
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tomkins.
I'll sure get it for you.

567
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,303
Yes, I sure will.

568
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,915
You plumb missed him but you cut wood.

569
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:59,478
It ain't the log you're supposed to shoot,
Zeke, it's the critter behind it.

570
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,717
You better get yourself
a pair of 'em specs, Zeke.

571
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,818
He won't stick his head up
so I can get a shot at him.

572
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,863
Jim Corey, next shooter.

573
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,702
Reckon he's laying an egg back there, Jim?

574
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,369
Yeah, he might be.

575
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,337
You missed!

576
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,076
Doggone it, that turkey can sure hide.

577
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,549
Maybe he wants to keep his head.

578
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,654
Alvin York, next shooter.

579
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,316
Bust him in the eye, Alvin,
if he winks at you.

580
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,723
Shoot him when he ain't looking.

581
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,830
You better sight him mighty fine, Alvin.
That there is the last turkey.

582
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,094
You can't hit him
if you can't see him, Alvin.

583
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,606
Better wait till he goes to roost, Alvin.

584
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,450
You got meat!

585
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,850
He sure busted him wide open.

586
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,617
I reckon
you just got to talk their language, Alvin.

587
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,748
I reckon you do.

588
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,885
You sure got him, Alvin. Ought to be
eating good if he ain't too tough.

589
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,155
This here bird ain't for eating.

590
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,221
Come on, fellows.
Get your targets ready for the beef shoot.

591
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,393
Rules same as all as were.
Shots are $1 apiece.

592
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,527
The two best shooters
get the hindquarters.

593
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,572
The next two get the forequarters.

594
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,573
Fifth man gets the hide and the tallow.

595
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,836
The sixth man gets to dig the lead
out of the tree.

596
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,105
All right, pay your dollar
and draw your number.

597
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,808
Load her up careful, George.
We got a long ways to paddle.

598
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,946
- Here you be, Alvin.
- Thankee.

599
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,316
Hey, Zeke, you ain't paid your dollar yet.

600
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,652
Why, sure enough.
I reckon it just slipped my mind.

601
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,586
How much for this here bird?

602
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,761
Well, I can't give you
any more than one shot, I reckon.

603
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,460
I'll be taking it and give me four more.

604
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,629
Five shots? Am I hearing you right, Alvin?

605
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,669
I'm a wanting five shots, Lem.

606
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,366
You figuring to get that whole critter?

607
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,934
My mind's sort of running that a-way.

608
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,809
Where'd you get 'em ideas, Alvin?

609
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,475
You sure got some shooters against you.

610
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,075
They'll get a chance
when I put the critter up again.

611
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:12,053
I'm a-needing cash money
and I'm gonna get it.

612
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,888
Ain't nobody ever cut five centers
unless it were Daniel Boone.

613
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,587
And you ain't wearing no coonskin hat.

614
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,094
I ain't a-needing one.

615
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,933
Number eight next.

616
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,116
Number nine.

617
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,635
How do they stand so far, Luke?

618
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,171
Ain't nobody cut center but Alvin York.

619
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,071
Alvin cut dead center all four times.

620
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,712
Two more shooters.
Tom Carver, you're first.

621
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,543
Alvin's got one more coming.

622
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,105
Get going, Tom.

623
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,391
You better draw down, Alvin.

624
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,168
You got to beat Tom's shot
if you want to get the whole beef, Alvin.

625
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,315
What do it look like?

626
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,758
It looks like plumb middle to me.

627
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,234
Well, Tom ain't more than a hair off,

628
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,741
but Alvin's done cut dead center,
fair and square.

629
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,709
- Howdy, Daniel Boone.
- There's your beef, Alvin. All yours.

630
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,313
- Five centers is right smart shooting.
- I ain't seen it like since the big one.

631
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,290
Well, any of you fellows
want another chance at that critter,

632
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,293
why, just drop a dollar apiece
in this here hat.

633
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,192
Are you shooting against us, Alvin?

634
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,322
- No, hey, not this time.
- I ain't got a dollar.

635
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,389
- Lend me a dollar, Lem.
- Here's my dollar, Alvin.

636
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,725
You... You lend me a couple of...

637
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,634
- Howdy, Miss Miranda.
- Howdy.

638
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,194
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, there.

639
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,104
- You all come over to see the shooting?
- Yeah.

640
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,335
It's all over now.

641
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,607
Alvin York cut center five times
and won Lem's beef critter on the hoof.

642
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,978
- Alvin won Lem's beef critter?
- Sure did.

643
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,540
- Well, I'll be danged.
- And he's putting him up again.

644
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,109
Well, boys, get your targets ready.

645
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,619
Oh, Mr. Tomkins,
I was just coming over to see you.

646
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:39,291
Here you be, $26. And I've got
the rest of it right here in my pocket.

647
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:43,321
I'm right sorry, Alvin, but I just sold that
bottomland to Zeb here.

648
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,928
- You're telling me you...
- Now, don't go raring off, Alvin.

649
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,561
I never figured you'd get that money.

650
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,038
Anyway, your time was rightly up
last Tuesday.

651
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,077
- Why, you allowed I could have more...
- But it wasn't in writing.

652
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,543
But I was a-taking your word for it...

653
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,342
And Zeb here paid me cash money
all down.

654
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,242
- He did, did he?
- It ain't my fault. He sold it to me.

655
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,751
Now look here...

656
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:03,979
Alvin!

657
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,751
Business is business.

658
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,119
- Wait a minute!
- Get out of here!

659
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,418
You better get, both of you!

660
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:12,485
It ain't no use, Alvin. You'd only be
fixing yourself for trouble.

661
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:17,794
I was... I was aiming to get that
piece of land.

662
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,199
Well, it weren't to be.

663
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,137
Mind you, Alvin, we can't always
figure the ways of Providence.

664
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,671
Alvin...

665
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,683
- Alvin, it don't make no difference.
- It do to me.

666
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,214
Come on, Buck.

667
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,970
Swing her, Buck, swing her!

668
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:04,612
I sure do admire big women. She's about
that biggest that I ever did see.

669
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,814
Three women in one she is, Alvin.
A whole passel of women.

670
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,453
Hey, a fellow who'd marry her'd
be a bigamist.

671
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:20,694
See? Big-muss. Yes, sir, bigamist.

672
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,197
Told me I could have 'em extra days.

673
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,703
- Oh, come on, Alvin.
- His word weren't no count.

674
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,337
Forget about Nate Tomkins, will you?

675
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,170
Quit pestering yourself. It ain't no use.

676
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,204
Look at that there big woman.

677
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:40,181
Why don't you have a turn with her, Alvin?
Take you back to your log rolling days.

678
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,717
"Business is business."

679
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:45,380
Well, once around her
is twice around Bear Mountain.

680
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,425
Look at Buck here, Alvin.
He's plumb tuckered out.

681
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,858
- I sure am.
- Well, he might be,

682
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,824
dancing around a whole passel of women
that-a-way.

683
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,661
- Another bottle, Marter.
- Sure.

684
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,360
That land were mine.

685
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,094
Ain't nobody gonna get it away from me.

686
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,341
I'd sure like to see you
toad-hop her about, Alvin.

687
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,741
I'm a-drinking against Nate Tomkins.

688
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,610
Now, how about that there big woman?

689
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,010
Alvin, you better be a-staying here.

690
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,847
- Let go of me.
- We'll go along with you.

691
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,046
What I got to do is my own.

692
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,326
It sure ain't a good night for a killing.

693
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,128
There's no stopping him now, I reckon.

694
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,164
Give me that old time religion.

695
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,131
- Howdy, Mr. Tomkins.
- Look here. Stand where you are.

696
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,763
Don't you come any closer.

697
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,934
- Mr. Tomkins, I just want to...
- Come closer and I'll hit you.

698
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,342
No need of getting riled, Mr. Tomkins.

699
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:39,870
- I ain't a-looking for no trouble with you.
- What you doing around here?

700
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,474
- Well, I want to talk to you about...
- What about?

701
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:43,883
About Abraham.

702
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:46,786
That mule's legally mine.
You ain't got no claim on him.

703
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,187
Well, I ain't denying he's yours...

704
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,285
Stay where you are if you don't want to be
laid out in two pieces.

705
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,196
Well, I was a-figuring
on a-buying Abraham back.

706
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,700
- Buying him back?
- Yes, sir.

707
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,826
My mule's kind of poorly,

708
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,533
and something done happened to him
and I sure need a mule.

709
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,536
- Are you meaning it?
- Yes, sir.

710
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,604
No hard feelings?

711
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,846
- Shucks, no, Mr. Tomkins.
- Well, I'll be damned.

712
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,182
And... And there's one more thing.

713
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,754
I'm asking your forgiveness
for a-flaring up at you the way I done.

714
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,622
It were Satan a-speaking out of me.

715
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:31,229
Zeke was a-telling me, but I...
I couldn't believe him.

716
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,462
- About what?
- That you got religion.

717
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,097
- Well, that's a fact, Mr. Tomkins.
- Well, I'll be damned.

718
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,198
Well, I sure would like to be a-buying
that there mule back.

719
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,641
- You would, huh?
- Yeah.

720
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,805
- How much would you be asking for him?
- Well, let's see.

721
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,941
You said he was worth $40
and I allowed you $30.

722
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,211
That's right.

723
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,743
Well, you can have him back for $20.

724
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,923
Mr. Tomkins, Abraham's worth
a sight more than that.

725
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,187
Maybe he is,

726
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:03,221
but seeing as how I'm trying to do
the fair and square thing, Alvin, $20.

727
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:09,436
I reckon I know what you're thinking.
It's more blessed to give than to receive.

728
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,803
Maybe. Come on, get your mule.

729
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,234
And another thing, I'm gonna
give you back the clock you sold me.

730
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,643
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it don't run nohow.

731
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,055
- Howdy, Mr. Andrews.
- Howdy.

732
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,000
I'd kind of like to see Zeb,
are he hereabout?

733
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,434
Maybe he is.

734
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,139
I sure would like to have words with him.

735
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,134
You coming peaceful?

736
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,647
Yes, sir, Mr. Andrews.
I ain't looking for no trouble.

737
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,272
Zeb. Come out of there.

738
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,318
There he be.

739
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,282
Howdy.

740
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,421
What you'd be wanting with me,
Alvin York?

741
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:07,025
I want to talk to you, Zeb, about...
About that there piece of land.

742
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,961
I bought it, it's mine.

743
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,998
I know it, but...

744
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,228
Sure it's yours, Zeb, but...

745
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,570
But Nate Tomkins was...
Was a-figuring that...

746
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,438
I ain't caring
what Nate Tomkins was a-figuring.

747
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,776
- Well, Nate was just thinking...
- It's mine and I'm gonna keep it.

748
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,680
Well, sure it's yours, Zeb,
but if you'll only allow me to talk...

749
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,843
Ain't nobody a-holding you.

750
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,814
Oh, yes, they are.

751
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,523
Well, anyway, Nate was a-thinking
that your being so busy here,

752
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:38,059
maybe you need some extra help
on the other piece of land.

753
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:41,927
- Well, what's that got to do with you?
- Well, I'm asking you for the job.

754
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:46,458
- You mean you're aiming to work for me?
- I'd be if you allow me.

755
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,733
Well, shucks. That sure got me stumped.

756
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,407
I was a-buying that land just to spite you.

757
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,671
Well, I sure don't blame you none.

758
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,343
Well, maybe we can figure it
so you can sharecrop the piece.

759
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,316
Then you kind of be a-working for yourself.

760
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,114
No, I ain't asking for anything extra, Zeb.

761
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,418
Well, if you can farm that bottomland
like you've been doing the top,

762
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,017
I reckon that land will be yours
in a couple of seasons.

763
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,857
Well, with the help of the Lord,
I'll make you a good crop.

764
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,592
Like I'm saying, Miss Gracie,

765
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,124
I ain't ever seen a prettier piece of land
than that there Andrews farm.

766
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,933
Corn is thicker than fur on a squirrel.

767
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,634
And I seen eight beef critters
a-grazing in the pasture there.

768
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,643
That are a lot of critters.

769
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:32,772
And that Zeb Andrews
sure are a forgiving man.

770
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,873
- Is he?
- Yes, sir.

771
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,745
Be sitting, Alvin.

772
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,716
- And a Christian man, if I ever seen one.
- Reckon so.

773
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,521
What I done to him that night
we were visiting you weren't right.

774
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,119
The devil was a-pushing me from behind.

775
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,596
It were too dark. I couldn't see.

776
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,859
I didn't have no call
to come twixt you and him.

777
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,631
What are you getting at, Alvin York?

778
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:58,070
All I'm aiming to say, Miss Gracie, is,

779
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,907
a upstanding man like Zeb Andrews
would make a girl a right smart husband.

780
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,468
- What's that?
- And...

781
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:08,176
And if you change your mind about Zeb,
well, I reckon I could...

782
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,914
- You could what?
- I could rightly understand.

783
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,980
Oh, you could, could you?

784
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,283
Lookee here, Alvin York,

785
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,525
if I wanted Zeb Andrews for a husband,

786
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:23,121
I reckon I could get him
without your acting so noble.

787
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,394
- I done kissed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

788
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,062
Well, I don't go around kissing men
I ain't gonna be a-marrying.

789
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,695
Now you be a-listening to me.

790
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,967
- Am I marrying a piece of land?
- Yes. No.

791
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,167
- Or a beef critter?
- No.

792
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,300
Or a field of corn?

793
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,868
No, it's you I'm marrying,
ain't nobody else in this here world.

794
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,004
- Are you hearing me?
- Yes.

795
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,105
Well, then don't you talk that way
to me again, Alvin!

796
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,980
- No.
- Don't you ever!

797
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,744
Oh!

798
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,085
The Lord sure do move
in mysterious ways.

799
01:03:56,532 --> 01:04:00,662
So that's what the Lord done said to Cain
when he done killed Abel.

800
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,569
It was a way of telling him
that he wouldn't get no crops no more.

801
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,108
And anybody that's a farmer
knows what that means.

802
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:10,339
Alvin, how do you know that it happened
just that-a-way?

803
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,278
A-seeing how you weren't there.

804
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,781
Well, the Book says so.

805
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,843
And there ain't nothing written
in the Book that ain't the truth.

806
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:23,487
So, a long time after that

807
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:27,017
when the Lord was a-giving Moses
the Ten Commandments,

808
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,460
he was a-saying, "Thou shalt not kill."

809
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,695
Now... Now go ahead with the reading.

810
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:36,800
Hey! Hey! War! Hey!

811
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:39,271
Hey! Pastor Pile!

812
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,701
- What's happened, Luke?
- It's war.

813
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,746
President Wilson done declared war
against Germany.

814
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,304
- You don't say?
- Yes, sir.

815
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,179
It says so right here in this here paper.

816
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,956
Here you are, Jim.
I reckon I won't wait to be drafted.

817
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,161
- I'm joining up as soon as the corn's in.
- Me, too.

818
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,967
Attaboy, Tom. I heard my daddy talk
about fighting Yankees.

819
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,134
And my granddaddy
done fought in the Revolution.

820
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,743
Sure wish I was a young fellow.

821
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,110
Well, come along, Zeke.
You load 'em and I'll shoot 'em.

822
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:23,378
- Hi, Alvin.
- Hi, Alvin.

823
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,044
Hey, Alvin, what about you?

824
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:27,681
You joining up now
or you waiting to be called?

825
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,657
I reckon I'm a-waiting.

826
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,955
- Howdy, lke.
- Hi, Alvin.

827
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,063
Howdy, Alvin.

828
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,295
Good morning, Pastor.
Reckon I need some coal oil.

829
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,871
I'm glad you come in, Alvin.
I was gonna send for you.

830
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,433
You was?

831
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:49,003
- You ain't registered yet, have you, Alvin?
- Of course I ain't.

832
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,979
Is that the new seed
you was gonna send for?

833
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,020
It's Tuesday, Alvin. You only got till 6:00.

834
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,079
I ain't a-gonna register.

835
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,555
Come here.

836
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,860
- You gotta register, Alvin.
- I ain't a-going to. I ain't a-going to war.

837
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,858
War is killing
and the Book's against killing.

838
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,732
So war is against the Book.

839
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,033
You're plumb right, Alvin.

840
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,134
You got the using kind of religion,
not the meetinghouse kind, but you...

841
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,839
- The kind I got's the kind you teached me.
- I know that.

842
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,974
And I hate to be telling you, but
I don't want to see you get in no trouble.

843
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,074
Now, you got to register

844
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,641
and there ain't no way
you can get out of it.

845
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,121
You mean they can make you go to war
even if it's against what you think is right?

846
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,990
No, no, no, they won't make you do that.
It's what I want to tell you.

847
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,357
Come here.

848
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,921
It's right here.

849
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,231
Let me see.

850
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:49,730
Now, wait a minute. Here.
There it is right there, see?

851
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,906
"Members of well-recognized
religious sects

852
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,877
"whose existent creed
forbids its members to participate in war

853
01:06:56,946 --> 01:07:00,746
"are entitled to request exemption
from military service."

854
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,716
What... What's that there exemption?

855
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,653
Well, that, it means,
if you're exempted, you don't have to go.

856
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,451
Well, how do I get this exemption?

857
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,755
Well, you got to write a letter
to the draft board.

858
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,895
- Is that all there is to it?
- Yep.

859
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:19,325
Well. Well, sure I'll register.
Will you write the letter for me?

860
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,427
Why, I'd be glad to, Alvin.
Come on over here.

861
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,232
"Therefore, we find
that we can't consider your church

862
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,038
"a well-recognized religious sect,

863
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:32,478
"organized and existing, May 18, 1917.

864
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,185
"We find further, that it has
no special creed except the Bible,

865
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:40,552
"which can be interpreted
by its members as they choose.

866
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,853
"And finally, there's nothing
in the creed of the church,

867
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,894
"expressly forbidding its members
to participate in war.

868
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,294
"Therefore your application for exemption
is denied."

869
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,562
Is this here the last word
or has he got some place to appeal?

870
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,901
He can appeal to
the District Board at Nashville

871
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,372
and finally to the General Board
in Washington.

872
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,273
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

873
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,833
You're welcome.

874
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:08,348
I'll be a-writing 'em appeals for you,
Alvin, so don't you be worrying.

875
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,009
Oh, I ain't a-worrying.

876
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,992
We'll be a-fixing this here bridge.

877
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,229
There it is.

878
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:33,969
So, we'll be a-building the house
right over there by that tree.

879
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,375
And the big room is gonna be...

880
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:41,680
The big room is gonna be right...
Right here in front, just like this.

881
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,010
And it's gonna have three windows.

882
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:48,250
And the kitchen will be here,
and it's gonna be good and big, too.

883
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,223
- And there'll be a stove.
- Where?

884
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,284
Well, right about there.

885
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,790
And I'm gonna build you one of 'em sinks.

886
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,958
And I'm gonna give you a pump,
so you won't have to carry

887
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,125
no water from the springs.

888
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,066
- A pump, Alvin?
- Sure.

889
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,035
Alvin, pumps costs a heap of money.

890
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:06,905
Well, we're gonna have curtains in the
windows and carpets on the floors.

891
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,568
And it ain't gonna take very long either

892
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,169
if the Lord keeps a-showering
his blessings on me.

893
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,408
Won't take more than two, three years,
I reckon.

894
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:18,078
Just to think, in two, three years,
a house right there where we're looking.

895
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,713
And it will be our house.

896
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:25,086
- Alvin.
- What do you want?

897
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,520
Pastor Pile wants to see you, Alvin.

898
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,860
Well, Gracie and me
is kind of busy right now.

899
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,230
Well, tell him I'll stop by the store
on the way home.

900
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,428
He said he wants to see you right off.

901
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,027
He said you best be a-coming.

902
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,335
Well, tell him I'll be there.

903
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,107
Shucks, just when we was having fun.

904
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,407
Would you be
a-telling me again sometime?

905
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,844
I sure will.

906
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:59,187
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Alvin.

907
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,723
I got right bad news for you.

908
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,664
Word just come.
They're a-taking you for the army.

909
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,995
Well, that can't be.

910
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:09,196
That letter we done sent to Washington,
says that I was against fighting and...

911
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,262
They ain't going to exempt you, Alvin.

912
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,332
You got to report to Nashville
tomorrow night.

913
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,202
I ain't a-going.

914
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,747
You ain't got no choice.
This was the last appeal.

915
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,614
I don't care about that. I ain't a-going.

916
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,851
You've got to go, Alvin. It's the law.

917
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:27,980
What?

918
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,423
What kind of law is it
that says a man's got to go

919
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,585
against the Book and its teachings?

920
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,494
Well, I reckon there ain't no answer, but,

921
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,630
if you don't go,
they'll be a-coming after you.

922
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,102
Well, they won't get me.
I'll go back in 'em hills.

923
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,001
Yeah, and they'll put hounds on your trail,

924
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,633
and they'll follow you
no matter how far back you go.

925
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:51,612
Then they'd better not catch up with me,
'cause they'll be a-wishing they hadn't. I...

926
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,783
Sorry, Pastor, I... Them's sinful words.

927
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,585
I wasn't thinking of what I was saying.

928
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,354
I'll go.

929
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:11,530
War's away to the other side
of the ocean, Alvin.

930
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,061
Lots of things can happen
before you get there.

931
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:20,800
You put your trust in the Lord
and he'll look out for you.

932
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,776
I done forgot the Lord.

933
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,040
I ain't never gonna forget him again.

934
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,442
Goodbye, Alvin.

935
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:50,898
Well...

936
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:58,703
I reckon these'll do till I get fixed up
in government clothes.

937
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,789
The corn's doing right good
on the south hill.

938
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,386
It might need a little extra hoeing.

939
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,994
Mule's at the gate.
You got a long ways to go.

940
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,501
Well, you'll be taking care of things
from now on, George.

941
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:29,839
Sure will.

942
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,710
I guess you'll be needing a man-sized gun.

943
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,783
- You can have my rifle.
- I'm a-thanking you.

944
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,749
Well...

945
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,658
I'm going.

946
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,399
I had to see you again, Alvin. I just had to.

947
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,004
Now, now...

948
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,777
No, no, don't you be looking at me, please.

949
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,242
Don't want you to be
remembering me like this.

950
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,356
Close your eyes, please?

951
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,351
Yessum.

952
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,484
- Are they closed?
- Yes.

953
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:31,904
Bye, Alvin.

954
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,844
I'll be a-coming back.
