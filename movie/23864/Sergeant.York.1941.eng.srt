1
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,383
"And he spake this parable
unto them saying,

2
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:32,446
"What man of you having a hundred sheep,

3
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:35,958
"if you lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety-nine, and..."

4
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,393
"Doth not leave the ninety-nine
in the wilderness,

5
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,300
"and go after that which was lost, until..."

6
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:55,675
"Until he find it."

7
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:57,838
"And when he hath found it, he layeth it,

8
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,882
"on his shoulder and rejoiceth.

9
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,679
"And when he cometh..."

10
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:06,182
All right, zeke, sit yourself down.

11
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,124
"And when he cometh home
he calleth together his friends

12
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:11,683
"and neighbors saying..."

13
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,629
"He calleth to his friends and neighbors,

14
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,202
"saying unto them, 'Rejoice with me,

15
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,137
"'for I have found my sheep
which were lost."'

16
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,407
I recollect the time Sam Harkness
lost his old sow.

17
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:32,046
He come out one morning,

18
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,879
the pen be busted down,
the sow was gone.

19
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:37,317
Sam lit out after it to find it.

20
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:42,118
He had six or seven other pigs
that didn't run off.

21
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,993
But did Sam get down
on his marrowbones,

22
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,427
and thank the good Lord for that?

23
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,932
No, siree, not Sam.

24
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,594
He hunted high and low for that old...

25
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:03,835
As I was saying,

26
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:06,778
he hunted high and low for that old sow.

27
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,011
About all he...

28
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:29,328
About all he done that summer
was hunt for that sow.

29
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:31,104
Wouldn't even stop...

30
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:34,201
Wouldn't even stop hunting
when winter come.

31
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:37,576
And sure enough, one night,
when he was plowing home...

32
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:40,742
One night, when he was plowing home
through the snow,

33
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:43,411
he seen something move in the shadows.

34
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:47,488
Sam... Sam's right scared.

35
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,218
Figures maybe it's a bear.

36
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,026
Then the...

37
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:53,762
Then the...

38
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,731
Then the bear grunts
and it ain't no bear at all.

39
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,267
It's the sow!

40
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,929
Well, Sam was fitting to be tied.

41
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:03,097
The rejoicingest man you ever seen.

42
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,803
Ten times as rejoiceful for the lost one
as for 'em that stayed in the fold.

43
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,503
Now this here...

44
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,738
Now this here...

45
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,974
Now this here is the point!

46
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:29,490
It appears to me that
the devil be a-knocking at the

47
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,397
door of the house of worship.

48
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,336
If there's any of you
want to go get him, you're...

49
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,202
You'll be free to go.

50
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,302
'Cause the meeting's over.

51
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:46,671
Lookee here, Pastor Pile.

52
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:49,013
Alvin York done shot his initials
in this tree.

53
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,950
"A-Y," plain as day.

54
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:54,988
It was Alvin York, Ike Botkin
and Buck Lipscomb in their liquor.

55
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,218
Who was you saying it was?

56
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:01,188
Who was you saying it was?

57
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,730
- It was Alvin, Mrs. York.
- How be you know it?

58
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,737
It wasn't Alvin, Mother York,
it was the liquor.

59
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,711
Mighty good shooting
for a man in his liquor.

60
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:18,744
Ain't it?

61
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,200
Say, let's do it again.

62
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,510
- Howdy, boys!
- Howdy!

63
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,939
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Luke.

64
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:29,143
- We were looking for you Saturday.
- Couldn't get here no more than fly.

65
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:32,120
Roads are getting soggier and soggier
between here and Rugby.

66
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,587
- Is that so?
- Water is so deep

67
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:37,786
in some of 'em creek beds,
had to use old Betsy's belly for a boat.

68
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,884
How are you, zeke?

69
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:42,022
I reckon you could have got here quicker
if you had carried Betsy.

70
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:45,363
Yeah, wished I could get me another mule
like old Flora.

71
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:47,335
They ain't turning out mules
like they used to.

72
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:48,597
No, sir!

73
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,571
Hey, what you got there, young fellow?

74
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,871
The very latest thing in ladies' hats,
the cloche model.

75
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,911
Women folks around here
wear split bonnets.

76
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,606
The young ones goes bareheaded.

77
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,580
Maybe so, but in modern merchandising,

78
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,345
the storekeeper endeavors
to create a demand.

79
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,613
Now in this line of ladies' bloomers,

80
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:08,623
very moderately priced,
has the finest elastic in the waistband,

81
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,519
also in the knees.

82
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,892
No amount of washing
will make it lose its snap.

83
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:16,397
- Your first trip in these parts, ain't it?
- Yes.

84
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,525
And we have them in three lovely colors.

85
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:22,037
Which we absolutely guarantee
will not fade or shrink.

86
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,263
Plenty of room in the seat, too.

87
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,969
I can tell you these garments
are mighty popular with the ladies.

88
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,508
- You can, huh?
- Yes.

89
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,047
Well, folks hereabouts wouldn't know
what 'em things is for.

90
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:33,139
- Lem?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,480
- Lem, here's your Nashville paper.
- Well, thank you, Pastor.

92
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:38,076
I got letters here for Tom Carver
and Ed Watson.

93
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:39,883
Both back tax bills, I reckon.

94
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:43,187
- What does it say, Lem?
- Well...

95
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:51,790
They're a-telling, Cordell Hull
are speechmaking over in Jimtown.

96
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,969
Appears he's out running
for Congress again.

97
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,199
- It says...
- I mind when Cord Hull

98
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,298
wasn't knee high to a toad frog,

99
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,309
and running around in his shirttail.

100
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,869
Just goes to show you what
a fellow can do if he gets book learning.

101
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,609
That paper is four days old,
I read it over at Nashville.

102
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:09,811
Yep. It took Luke three days
of mule-paddling

103
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,513
to bring the mail from Rugby.

104
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:14,317
I can believe that,
after driving over here from Jamestown.

105
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,652
Jimtown.

106
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,350
- I thought it was Jamestown.
- It are.

107
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:25,199
Well, anyway, since driving over here,

108
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,570
what I'd like to know is,
how do you fellows get into this valley?

109
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,606
We were born here.

110
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:37,144
Now look, Mr. Pile,

111
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,874
I'd like to sell you some of these garments

112
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,973
before the price goes up
on account of the war.

113
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,312
What war?

114
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,812
Why, the... The war in Europe.

115
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,283
Oh, that war.

116
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,929
Yes, certainly.

117
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:58,391
Look likes the Germans
might get into Paris, don't you think?

118
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:01,494
Well, we ain't done
much thinking on it, mister.

119
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:03,368
It ain't in our corner, nohow.

120
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,236
If you're hankering for trouble,

121
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,503
it ain't scarce
right here in these mountains.

122
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:10,137
Oh, I ain't looking for any trouble.

123
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,712
Yep, fighting could have been
mighty plentiful

124
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:15,808
down at the meeting house last night.
Did you hear?

125
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:19,377
Alvin York and two other fellows
done busted up the meeting.

126
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:22,390
That ain't a smithereen
to what he done in Jimtown.

127
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,790
- Nigh split the jail, he did.
- No...

128
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,954
Raised such a rumpus
they had to turn him loose.

129
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,087
Do tell.

130
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:30,530
Old man Jarvis up Bear Creek way

131
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,864
told me he seen the three of 'em
riding their mules,

132
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,267
hell-bent for election,
toward the Kentucky border.

133
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,828
I reckon their liquor was getting low

134
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,773
and they wanted to get there
before they sobered up.

135
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:47,340
Howdy, Mrs. York.

136
00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:50,884
- Howdy, Luke.
- Howdy, Mother York.

137
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:55,384
- Tolerable, Pastor.
- What can I do for you today?

138
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,152
Could I be getting a can of baking powder
and a...

139
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:03,088
- Poke of salt?
- Sure thing.

140
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:15,137
I ain't having but five eggs
and they're kind of puny.

141
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,371
Oh, eggs are eggs, I reckon.

142
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:20,816
I was plumb out of salt.

143
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:28,650
Don't be taking it hard, Mother York,
what you just heard.

144
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,650
I ain't taking nothing hard, Pastor.

145
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:35,992
And I ain't making excuses
for Alvin to nobody.

146
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,726
Of course you ain't,
and I ain't asking you to.

147
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:42,861
- I'm right proud of Alvin.
- Got a right to be.

148
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,707
Works hard, Alvin does.

149
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,911
Patching and scratching that poor land.

150
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:55,341
It's mighty hard work,
getting corn out of rocks.

151
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,281
- Indeed it is.
- Who's to blame him

152
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:01,713
if he busts loose now and again?

153
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:04,558
Nobody, Mother York, nary a soul.

154
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,723
Of course, I ain't for Alvin

155
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,095
doing like he does.

156
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,998
A little religion wouldn't do him no hurt.

157
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,707
No, it wouldn't.

158
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:26,113
Pastor, I wouldn't be against
your talking to Alvin.

159
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,310
You reckon it'd do any good?

160
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,788
Well, it wouldn't do no harm.

161
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:37,192
I'd be riding up and having a talk with him.

162
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,586
I'm thanking you, Pastor.

163
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,873
- George.
- Yes, Ma?

164
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,881
I reckon I know where your brother's at.

165
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,419
He's up at the Kentucky border.

166
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,590
- Go fetch him.
- Yessum.

167
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:25,072
Better be taking a piece of corn
for your supper, Son.

168
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,368
Yessum.

169
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,252
- Hiya, Marter.
- Hiya, Alvin.

170
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,557
- Mart, we wants to get us a bottle.
- Now look here, Alvin.

171
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:54,129
You know, I know and so do the Sheriff.
You're from over here in Tennessee.

172
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:57,695
And I can't sell you no liquor
less you gets over yonder in Kentucky.

173
00:13:57,773 --> 00:14:02,676
Marter, you are the legalest fellow in
these here parts, if you ain't nothing else.

174
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:04,144
You gotta be, in this business.

175
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:07,080
Maybe our credit ain't no good
in Tennessee.

176
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,107
Bet it ain't no better in Kentuck.

177
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:12,377
What you be having, Alvin?

178
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:14,946
You got any corn without no lye in it?

179
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:16,992
No poison oak leaves in it, either.

180
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,186
Ain't no lye in this liquor.

181
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:57,561
Plumb hollow I am,
like an old, burnt-out stump.

182
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,157
Me, too.

183
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,201
What are we drinking to, Alvin?

184
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:07,533
What'll we drink to, Ike?

185
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:11,335
Why, I reckon we drunk
to pretty near everything there is.

186
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:15,281
- I can't think of nothing new.
- Me neither.

187
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:18,651
Reckon we better begin all over?

188
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:21,751
If we can't drink to something,

189
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,083
why don't we drink against something?

190
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,957
Against something? Against what?

191
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:29,464
Oh, against something
or somebody we're against.

192
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:33,593
I ain't against nobody or nothing.
Except getting sober.

193
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,768
We'll drink against that.

194
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:39,239
You... You'll be a-killing
two birds with one stone.

195
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:42,334
- Come on. Sure.
- Ain't never gonna get sober.

196
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:52,821
Never gonna get...

197
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:01,625
Well, I'll be blowed.

198
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,928
What are you doing here, George?

199
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:07,594
Young'uns like you ain't got no business
in a place like this here, nohow.

200
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,969
- Now just you skedaddle.
- Ma wants you home.

201
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:15,105
- Now look here, George...
- Ma wants you.

202
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:18,738
- Shucks, son of a gun...
- Well,

203
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:23,577
reckon I better go. I'll be seeing you.

204
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,017
His ma wants him.

205
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,894
Get up.

206
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:40,867
Here, here. Quit that.

207
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,029
Hold your horses, Marter.

208
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:57,350
Here we go.

209
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,453
Here we go again.

210
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,625
I'm still a-coming.

211
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,897
Say when you got enough.

212
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,526
Say it.

213
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:47,859
Enough, enough.

214
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,141
Ma wants you, Alvin.

215
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:01,781
Ma wants you.

216
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,112
Coming, George.

217
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,934
- I'll be seeing you.
- So long, Al.

218
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:44,082
Here he is, Ma.

219
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:47,460
It took a heap of looking,
but he come easy.

220
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,864
- Fetch me a pail of water, George.
- Yessum.

221
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,504
Breakfast's ready, now it is.
Better be getting at it.

222
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:39,239
South field needs a-plowing.

223
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,759
The Lord bless these victuals we done got

224
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:59,431
and help us to be
beholding to nobody. Amen.

225
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:07,574
I reckon you'll want some salt
on your <i>pone:</i>

226
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:19,819
Whoa, Fred.

227
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:30,231
Giddap, Noah.

228
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:37,730
Whoa.

229
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,870
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Alvin.

230
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,243
I've been kind of expecting you.

231
00:20:46,482 --> 00:20:49,383
I'm right sorry about the other night, I...

232
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:52,417
I reckon I done the wrong thing.

233
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,420
See that rock, Alvin?

234
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:59,089
You've been plowing around that rock
a heap of years.

235
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:00,792
Sure have.

236
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:03,587
Did you ever think when you start plowing
your furrows crooked,

237
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:06,532
it's mighty hard to get 'em straight again.

238
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:10,603
- I never thought on it much.
- It's that a-way, I reckon,

239
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,174
with other things besides plowing.

240
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:18,575
Satan's got you by the shirttail, Alvin.

241
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:20,782
Sure has. Giddap, Noah.

242
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,249
He's gonna yank you straight down to hell.

243
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:24,717
You are plum right, Pastor.

244
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:27,585
You gotta make him let loose of you
before it's too late.

245
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,021
I sure wish I know'd how.

246
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:31,389
Wrestle him, Alvin,
wrestle him like you would a bear.

247
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,918
I done wrestled him, Pastor, but...
Whoa, whoa there, Noah.

248
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:37,029
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, Noah.

249
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,697
But old Satan, he hangs on tight.

250
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,531
You and the Lord could throw him, Alvin.

251
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:44,436
Why, twixt the two of you,
you'd have old Satan down in a jiffy.

252
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,736
Why, I sure wish the Lord would throw in.

253
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:48,743
He will, if you ask him.

254
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:52,504
Oh, I done prayed, Pastor,
till I was black in the face.

255
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:59,949
- But it wasn't no use.
- It ain't only praying, Alvin, it's believing.

256
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:01,649
Now, you see here.

257
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,727
Take a look at the old oak yonder.
Looks mighty strong.

258
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:09,662
Been standing there since your pa
was a boy a-plowing in the same field.

259
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:12,529
Looks like it could go right on standing
all by itself, don't it?

260
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:13,659
Yep.

261
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:16,795
Just a-resting itself
and feeding on the earth.

262
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,667
Well, it can't. It can't stand there

263
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:22,938
without there's a lot of deep roots
a-holding it up.

264
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:26,378
Can't see the roots,
but they're there just the same.

265
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:29,244
It appears to me it's been planned
a fellow's got to have his roots

266
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:31,752
in something outside his own self.

267
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,421
I reckon I ain't found no roots
what'll hold me up, when...

268
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,183
When I'm hell-bent to fall.

269
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,626
And then take the animals in the woods.

270
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:42,095
Squirrels'd go mighty hungry

271
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:44,792
if nothing made 'em store up nuts
for the wintertime.

272
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:45,959
- Sure would.
- How do you reckon

273
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:49,868
birds get to fly north in the summer
if there ain't something a-guiding 'em?

274
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:52,907
A bird ain't got no way of telling
north from south.

275
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,772
And then there's the bees.

276
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:57,311
Bees'd sure be in a fix
if they wasn't beholding to something

277
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,973
to show 'em how to get back to the hives.

278
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:03,142
Well, I ain't no bird and I ain't no squirrel.

279
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:06,313
- And I sure ain't no bee.
- Well, that's right, Alvin.

280
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:11,189
The way I figure, there ain't no use for a
fellow going out looking for religion. It's...

281
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,955
Well, it's just gotta come to a fellow.

282
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:15,155
It'll come, my boy. You'll see.

283
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,698
Maybe slow, like the way daylight comes.

284
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,826
And maybe in a flash,
like a bolt of lightning.

285
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,369
- When?
- When you ain't even expecting it.

286
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:28,172
Well, I hope so.

287
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:32,742
Giddap, Noah. I'll be seeing you.

288
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:59,602
Get after him, now.

289
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,547
Tracks are mighty fresh.
Less than an hour old.

290
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,913
- Reckon it's a red fox?
- Might be red and might be gray.

291
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:10,383
It's making a big circle.

292
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:12,579
Can't tell about his course
till he gets out on the flat.

293
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,579
They took to the hill there.
Yeah, that-a-way.

294
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,581
What's the matter, Alvin?

295
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,091
Howdy.

296
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,234
- You're Alvin York, ain't you?
- Yes.

297
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:01,893
Let's get going, Alvin.

298
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,842
I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
Where you been keeping yourself?

299
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,707
- Hereabouts.
- What's ailing you?

300
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,644
Are you coming or ain't you?

301
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:15,114
You better go get that fox, George.

302
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:16,980
You're just tetched.

303
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:20,043
How's your ma?

304
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,049
I asked you how your ma was.

305
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,224
Tolerable.

306
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,092
I figured it was you out a-hunting.

307
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,725
No mistaking the voices
of 'em hound dogs.

308
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:34,701
One's a-having a hook to the end of its bay

309
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,897
you could be hanging a bucket on.

310
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:41,932
The other's a croak, just like a frog,
about moonrise.

311
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:45,679
- What...
- You ain't Gracie Williams, are you?

312
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:48,706
Well, I ain't nobody but.

313
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,042
Why, you was only just...

314
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,987
You sure growed up all of a sudden like...

315
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,758
Reckon I have.

316
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:02,762
Sounds as if they've run that fox
to ground.

317
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,534
I said 'em hound dogs
run the fox to ground.

318
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,995
You better be getting along.

319
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:12,606
Reckon I had.

320
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:16,773
- I'll be seeing you.
- Hoping.

321
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:00,744
Ma.

322
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:02,915
Yeah?

323
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:06,625
When you and Pa got hitched,
what did Pa have to set up with?

324
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:09,664
Well, your pa had this here farm

325
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:15,131
and a mule and $5, no $6.

326
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,535
What did Grandpa have?

327
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:24,903
Your grandpa had this here farm,
a pair of horses.

328
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:27,578
The mare was in foal.

329
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,077
I reckon I wouldn't, George.

330
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:41,551
Ma.

331
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:45,228
It's sure ripped down here.
You reckon you can fix it?

332
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,167
I reckon. Come over here, Alvin.

333
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:51,470
Bend over.

334
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:57,340
You're a-figuring on setting up,
ain't you, Son?

335
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,407
- Yessum.
- Getting married?

336
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:03,508
- Who's it gonna be?
- Gracie Williams.

337
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:06,545
Gracie Williams?

338
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,984
Asked her yet?

339
00:28:13,728 --> 00:28:15,059
No, I ain't.

340
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,561
What's the matter?

341
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,665
I ain't said nothing.

342
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,268
Reckon that'll hold.

343
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,700
Reckon it better.

344
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,389
Hold it thataway, zeb.

345
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:50,398
Thinking on going to that there shindig
next Saturday night, Miss Gracie?

346
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,860
- I ain't been asked.
- Well...

347
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:56,202
You've been asked now.

348
00:28:57,138 --> 00:29:00,471
- I can't say, zeb. I have to think it over.
- Well, I don't...

349
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,773
Joshua, 14, verse 9...

350
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:09,775
You'd be a-coming if you wanted to,
Miss Gracie.

351
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:12,342
Maybe I could and maybe I couldn't.

352
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:16,520
Why, it's Alvin York.

353
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,991
- Howdy, Miss Gracie.
- Howdy, Alvin.

354
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:22,757
- You know zeb Andrews, ain't you?
- Howdy.

355
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:25,222
Knitting, zeb?

356
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:28,666
He was just a-helping me.

357
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,937
I wasn't expecting you
to be a-calling so soon.

358
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:34,305
Well, I said I'd be seeing you.

359
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:38,077
Last time I seen Alvin
he was chasing a fox.

360
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,475
He stopped here for a spell to

361
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,407
kind of catch his breath.

362
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:46,911
- Did you kill that fox, Alvin?
- I sure did.

363
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:49,889
- We run over there...
- Was that a gray fox or a red?

364
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:51,648
Red. Just to the side of that...

365
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:54,718
Why, a red fox skin ain't worth nothing
this time of the year.

366
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,661
That little hollow...

367
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,164
This one was.

368
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:04,231
"Asa begat Joshiat
and Joshiat begat Joshua."

369
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:07,036
It's just Uncle Lige talking to himself.

370
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:10,807
Zeb here was telling me there's gonna be
a dance over to Thomson's Mill.

371
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:11,937
Yeah, I hear that...

372
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:14,413
Ed Morgan's gonna do the fiddling.

373
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:15,640
I was figuring that...

374
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:18,709
Just about the best fiddler
in these here parts, he is.

375
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:21,187
- He ain't.
- Lf he ain't, who'd be?

376
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:24,191
- Tod Haskins.
- He can't hold a candle to Ed.

377
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,686
- You're a-thinking.
- I'm a-knowing.

378
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,893
- Oh, you are, are you?
- Now, now, now. Hush up, you two.

379
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:33,457
There ain't no call
for fussing over a fiddler.

380
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,402
- We weren't a-fussing. I was telling him...
- Well, I'm a-telling you...

381
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:40,965
The way I figure, Ed's better at the jigging
and Tod can sure fiddle a square.

382
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:45,638
"It biteth like a serpent,
and stingeth like an adder."

383
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:50,950
Uncle Lige there was a-telling me
that corn's right good this harvest.

384
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,180
How's the crops up your way, Alvin?

385
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:56,155
We figure to get about
20 bushel to the acre.

386
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,124
We're gonna get about 60.

387
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,588
Well, there's a heap of difference

388
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:01,356
twixt farming the bottomland and the top.

389
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,522
- Well, there sure is.
- I reckon...

390
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:07,534
You know, I don't see how you get
five bushels off of that there land of yours.

391
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:09,695
Now look here, zeb Andrews...

392
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:14,704
Miss... Miss Gracie,

393
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:18,778
I'd sure be much obliged
if I could have a cup of water.

394
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:20,371
I got some nipping cider.

395
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:23,645
- Well, that'd go mighty good.
- I'll be getting it.

396
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:28,285
"And the lion shall lie down
with the lamb."

397
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:57,343
Here's your cider. It's coming from the...

398
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:58,985
Where's zeb?

399
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,120
- What's he...
- I reckon he lit out.

400
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:09,319
Well, isn't he be coming back?

401
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:11,928
No, ma'am, he ain't.

402
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,363
- That strikes me mighty queer.
- Yessum.

403
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:19,437
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

404
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:22,402
"do it with thy might."

405
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,447
Alvin, you...

406
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,775
You was fighting.

407
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:33,015
- It weren't much.
- Alvin York...

408
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,614
You ain't a-fitting to come a-visiting a girl.

409
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,453
He ain't got no business
around here anyhow.

410
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:39,584
As much business as you have, Alvin York.

411
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:41,561
- No, he ain't.
- Well, why ain't he?

412
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,790
- Well, he ain't because...
- Because, why?

413
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,097
Because...
Because I'm a-going to marry you.

414
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,961
- You what?
- I'm a-going to marry you.

415
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:56,709
Now, now, now, Alvin, you stop that.
Don't you be saying things like that.

416
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:58,575
- Don't you be saying 'em.
- Well, I have.

417
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:00,011
It ain't...

418
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,215
- Oh, you are, are you?
- Yessum.

419
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:03,978
Well, you can't...

420
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:08,178
- Well, your mother told me about it.
- That's what I'm a-doing.

421
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,050
Well, I never... Lookee here...

422
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,085
I wouldn't have you on a Christmas tree,
Alvin York.

423
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:17,697
Fine husband you'd make.

424
00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:20,200
I allow zeb Andrews would make
a better one?

425
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:22,668
Oh, how should I know? Maybe he would.

426
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:27,435
Zeb Andrews got a piece of bottomland,
that's it, ain't it?

427
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,409
You thinking that's it, aren't you?

428
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:35,382
Folks say you're no good
except for fighting and hell raising

429
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,782
and I'm thinking they're plumb right.

430
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,080
If I had a piece of bottomland,

431
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:41,179
I'd guess it'd make a heap of difference,
wouldn't it?

432
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:43,349
- A piece of bottomland!
- Well, I can get some.

433
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,415
Well, go and get it. I ain't a-caring.

434
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:48,951
There ain't nothing I can't get
if I set my mind to it.

435
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,555
You don't think much of yourself, do you?

436
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,533
Yes, I do.

437
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:55,193
Amen.

438
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:12,645
That there's bottomland soil, ain't it?

439
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:20,185
Queer how the folks
that lives on the bottom

440
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:23,547
looks down on the folks on top.

441
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,360
It was always that way.

442
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:30,928
Ain't no changing it.

443
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:33,934
Well, I'm a-gonna change it.

444
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,696
I'm a-gonna get us a piece of bottomland.

445
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:42,137
Your pa set out to get hisself
a piece of bottomland once.

446
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:45,769
Nary a man ever tried harder.

447
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:49,810
Liked to kill hisself trying.

448
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,954
It was a long time before he gave up,

449
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,252
but he had to in the end.

450
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:03,361
Well, I ain't a-setting myself up
as a better man than Pa.

451
00:36:03,464 --> 00:36:05,694
I reckon I ain't half as good,

452
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:09,969
but I'm a-knowing where there's
a piece of bottomland to be had

453
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,002
and I'm a-gonna get it.

454
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:16,934
Maybe you will.

455
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:24,148
How old you say this here mule be?

456
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,551
- Nine year, but Abraham's sound.
- Yes, he are.

457
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,858
He's kind of pussle-gutted,
it appears to me.

458
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:35,828
Nary a bit.
He's just mighty well fed, that's all.

459
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,158
Well...

460
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:41,729
I reckon I might allow you $30 on him.

461
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,361
- $30?
- Yeah.

462
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:44,962
- You say $30?
- Yeah.

463
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,473
Well, he's worth $40 if he's worth a cent.

464
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,339
Then he ain't worth a cent.

465
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:55,105
- What's all this here you got?
- Well, there's two dozen pullets.

466
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:56,507
$6.

467
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,216
Why, that's 25 cents apiece.
They're worth twice that much.

468
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,847
Not to me, they ain't.

469
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:06,121
- What are these?
- Them's prime winter pelts, Mr. Tomkins.

470
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:10,093
Mighty poor. They won't fetch that much.

471
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,765
I might allow you $1.50 apiece for 'em.

472
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:15,359
Well, I can get $3 apiece for 'em
in Jimtown.

473
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:17,563
It's quite a-ways to Jimtown.

474
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:20,334
Let's see now. That's $40.50.

475
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,804
- What else you got?
- Well, there's

476
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:25,869
two sacks of rabbit skins,

477
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,882
this here clock
and a sack of goose feathers.

478
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:35,911
I tell you, Alvin,

479
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,790
I'll give you 50 United States dollars
for the whole caboodle.

480
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:42,887
- $50 for everything?
- That's the best I can do.

481
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:46,433
- Sounds like an awful little.
- Take it or leave it.

482
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:49,996
Can you... Can you do any better
on the price of the land?

483
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:51,834
Not a cent. $120.

484
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:54,431
- How much time I got to pay for the rest?
- Sixty days.

485
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,000
Well, it's a bargain. I'll take it.

486
00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:01,278
Well, then I reckon
we can put it in writing.

487
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,778
You understand now, don't you, Alvin?

488
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,583
If I don't get my money afore the 60 days,

489
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:13,093
you lose the whole caboodle
and you don't get the land.

490
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:17,063
Now, $70 is a lot of money
for a fellow like you to get his hands on.

491
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:19,031
It's more than a dollar a day.

492
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,228
Now then, 60 days is all you got.

493
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:27,636
Sixty days and sixty nights.

494
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:29,535
What?

495
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,237
Well, the way I figure,

496
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:35,646
if I count the nights, too, I got
nigh onto four months to pay you off.

497
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,544
Well, that's one way of figuring it.

498
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:42,948
Well, I'll tell you.

499
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:46,016
I was figuring on taking
'em rocks out myself, Alvin.

500
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:49,655
But if you're willing to take on the job
at 75 cents a day,

501
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,890
- well, I...
- I'll take it.

502
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,899
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:56,226
Well, I tell you. I was thinking
maybe I could shoe your mules for you.

504
00:39:56,297 --> 00:40:00,358
Sorry, Alvin. Had 'em shod
just yesterday over to Possum Trot.

505
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:04,029
Might give you two, three days
work though, splitting rails.

506
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:05,538
That's good.

507
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,822
Oh, I reckon it's worth about...

508
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,594
- $3.
- $3?

509
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:33,159
Why, that's a right fair price, Pastor.

510
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,600
I only worked two days to get it.

511
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:37,727
It's worth it

512
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:40,098
to me.

513
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:42,005
All right, George, let him go.

514
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:44,544
Giddap, Noah, giddap. Come on.

515
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,705
- Giddap, Noah.
- Giddap, Noah.

516
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:48,009
Come on, Noah.

517
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:49,911
Come on.

518
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:06,598
Whoa, Noah.

519
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:12,830
What... Why, Miss Gracie,

520
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,605
I was thinking you was to the dance.

521
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:18,167
No. I ain't at the dance.

522
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:21,314
No. No, I can see that.

523
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,715
Alvin, I...

524
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:25,641
Yeah?

525
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,220
- Alvin, I just...
- Yeah?

526
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:31,513
I...

527
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,353
Alvin...

528
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,470
That's what I was wanting to tell you.

529
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,283
Giddap, Noah.

530
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,026
Lord...

531
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:21,861
Lord, if you can,

532
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:25,069
help him to be getting his land.

533
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:27,499
Amen.

534
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:30,870
All right, George.

535
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,239
Again.

536
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:36,310
Again.

537
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,014
Gotta get under there.

538
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,800
It ain't no use, George.

539
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:55,096
I can't do it.

540
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,634
- Yes, you can.
- I tell you, I can't do it!

541
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,609
My time's up tomorrow night!

542
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:16,387
There ain't enough money
for the bottomland.

543
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,789
I can't get the rest!

544
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:24,789
How?

545
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:27,930
How am I gonna do it?

546
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:51,122
- Howdy, Alvin.
- Mr. Tomkins, I've got to talk to you.

547
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:53,490
Well, I reckon it's money
what talks the loudest.

548
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:55,051
You got the rest of your payment?

549
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:57,495
- Well, no, I ain't got it all.
- That's bad.

550
00:44:57,565 --> 00:45:01,467
- But I can get it for you by Saturday.
- Saturday ain't Tuesday.

551
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:04,002
All I'm asking is, is for four extra days.

552
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:06,301
How can I be sure
you'll get it by Saturday?

553
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:09,900
Well, there's a beef and turkey shoot
coming up. You must've heard about it.

554
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:12,241
- Yeah.
- I'm aiming to cut five targets

555
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,873
and win the beef critter
and then put him up for cash money.

556
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,814
- It ain't likely.
- Oh, yes, it is.

557
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,819
- That'll take some shooting, Alvin.
- But I could do it.

558
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:23,050
Well, I'd like to do you a favor, Alvin, but...

559
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:24,112
Will you?

560
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,284
There's another fellow
asking for that land.

561
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,885
- You ain't letting him have it.
- I don't know.

562
00:45:28,963 --> 00:45:32,262
I was telling him
your option was up Tuesday and...

563
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:36,565
But I got to have 'em extra days,
Mr. Tomkins. I just got to.

564
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:39,765
Well, I oughtn't to do it,

565
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,536
but I reckon he can wait till Saturday.

566
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:46,342
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tomkins.
I'll sure get it for you.

567
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,040
Yes, I sure will.

568
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:56,653
You plumb missed him but you cut wood.

569
00:45:56,724 --> 00:46:00,216
It ain't the log you're supposed to shoot,
zeke, it's the critter behind it.

570
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:02,455
You better get yourself
a pair of 'em specs, zeke.

571
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,556
He won't stick his head up
so I can get a shot at him.

572
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,601
Jim Corey, next shooter.

573
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:20,440
Reckon he's laying an egg back there, Jim?

574
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:22,106
Yeah, he might be.

575
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:25,075
You missed!

576
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:27,814
Doggone it, that turkey can sure hide.

577
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:30,286
Maybe he wants to keep his head.

578
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,391
Alvin York, next shooter.

579
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:35,053
Bust him in the eye, Alvin,
if he winks at you.

580
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:37,461
Shoot him when he ain't looking.

581
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:44,568
You better sight him mighty fine, Alvin.
That there is the last turkey.

582
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,831
You can't hit him
if you can't see him, Alvin.

583
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:53,344
Better wait till he goes to roost, Alvin.

584
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:02,187
You got meat!

585
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:04,588
He sure busted him wide open.

586
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:07,354
I reckon
you just got to talk their language, Alvin.

587
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:08,486
I reckon you do.

588
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:11,622
You sure got him, Alvin. Ought to be
eating good if he ain't too tough.

589
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:12,893
This here bird ain't for eating.

590
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,959
Come on, fellows.
Get your targets ready for the beef shoot.

591
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:19,130
Rules same as all as were.
Shots are $1 apiece.

592
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:21,265
The two best shooters
get the hindquarters.

593
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:23,310
The next two get the forequarters.

594
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:25,311
Fifth man gets the hide and the tallow.

595
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:27,574
The sixth man gets to dig the lead
out of the tree.

596
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:29,843
All right, pay your dollar
and draw your number.

597
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:33,546
Load her up careful, George.
We got a long ways to paddle.

598
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:35,683
- Here you be, Alvin.
- Thankee.

599
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:38,054
Hey, zeke, you ain't paid your dollar yet.

600
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:41,390
Why, sure enough.
I reckon it just slipped my mind.

601
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:44,323
How much for this here bird?

602
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,499
Well, I can't give you
any more than one shot, I reckon.

603
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,198
I'll be taking it and give me four more.

604
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:55,366
Five shots? Am I hearing you right, Alvin?

605
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:58,406
I'm a wanting five shots, Lem.

606
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:01,103
You figuring to get that whole critter?

607
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,671
My mind's sort of running that a-way.

608
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,547
Where'd you get 'em ideas, Alvin?

609
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:07,212
You sure got some shooters against you.

610
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,812
They'll get a chance
when I put the critter up again.

611
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,791
I'm a-needing cash money
and I'm gonna get it.

612
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,626
Ain't nobody ever cut five centers
unless it were Daniel Boone.

613
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:19,325
And you ain't wearing no coonskin hat.

614
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,831
I ain't a-needing one.

615
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,670
Number eight next.

616
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:42,854
Number nine.

617
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:33,373
How do they stand so far, Luke?

618
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,908
Ain't nobody cut center but Alvin York.

619
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:38,809
Alvin cut dead center all four times.

620
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:44,449
Two more shooters.
Tom Carver, you're first.

621
00:49:44,518 --> 00:49:46,281
Alvin's got one more coming.

622
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:47,843
Get going, Tom.

623
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,129
You better draw down, Alvin.

624
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:11,905
You got to beat Tom's shot
if you want to get the whole beef, Alvin.

625
00:50:27,461 --> 00:50:29,053
What do it look like?

626
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:31,495
It looks like plumb middle to me.

627
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:48,971
Well, Tom ain't more than a hair off,

628
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:52,479
but Alvin's done cut dead center,
fair and square.

629
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,447
- Howdy, Daniel Boone.
- There's your beef, Alvin. All yours.

630
00:50:56,523 --> 00:51:00,050
- Five centers is right smart shooting.
- I ain't seen it like since the big one.

631
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:03,028
Well, any of you fellows
want another chance at that critter,

632
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:05,030
why, just drop a dollar apiece
in this here hat.

633
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:06,929
Are you shooting against us, Alvin?

634
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,059
- No, hey, not this time.
- I ain't got a dollar.

635
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:11,127
- Lend me a dollar, Lem.
- Here's my dollar, Alvin.

636
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,462
You... You lend me a couple of...

637
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,371
- Howdy, Miss Miranda.
- Howdy.

638
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:16,932
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, there.

639
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,841
- You all come over to see the shooting?
- Yeah.

640
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:20,072
It's all over now.

641
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:24,345
Alvin York cut center five times
and won Lem's beef critter on the hoof.

642
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,716
- Alvin won Lem's beef critter?
- Sure did.

643
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:29,278
- Well, I'll be danged.
- And he's putting him up again.

644
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:31,847
Well, boys, get your targets ready.

645
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:35,357
Oh, Mr. Tomkins,
I was just coming over to see you.

646
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:40,029
Here you be, $26. And I've got
the rest of it right here in my pocket.

647
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,059
I'm right sorry, Alvin, but I just sold that
bottomland to zeb here.

648
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,666
- You're telling me you...
- Now, don't go raring off, Alvin.

649
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:49,299
I never figured you'd get that money.

650
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,776
Anyway, your time was rightly up
last Tuesday.

651
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:54,814
- Why, you allowed I could have more...
- But it wasn't in writing.

652
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:56,281
But I was a-taking your word for it...

653
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:59,080
And zeb here paid me cash money
all down.

654
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:01,980
- He did, did he?
- It ain't my fault. He sold it to me.

655
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:03,488
Now look here...

656
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:04,717
Alvin!

657
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:06,489
Business is business.

658
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,857
- Wait a minute!
- Get out of here!

659
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:09,156
You better get, both of you!

660
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:13,222
It ain't no use, Alvin. You'd only be
fixing yourself for trouble.

661
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:18,532
I was... I was aiming to get that
piece of land.

662
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:19,936
Well, it weren't to be.

663
00:52:20,007 --> 00:52:23,875
Mind you, Alvin, we can't always
figure the ways of Providence.

664
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,408
Alvin...

665
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:35,421
- Alvin, it don't make no difference.
- It do to me.

666
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:42,951
Come on, Buck.

667
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:59,707
Swing her, Buck, swing her!

668
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,349
I sure do admire big women. She's about
that biggest that I ever did see.

669
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:12,551
Three women in one she is, Alvin.
A whole passel of women.

670
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:16,191
Hey, a fellow who'd marry her'd
be a bigamist.

671
00:53:16,596 --> 00:53:21,431
See? Big-muss. Yes, sir, bigamist.

672
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,935
Told me I could have 'em extra days.

673
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:28,440
- Oh, come on, Alvin.
- His word weren't no count.

674
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,075
Forget about Nate Tomkins, will you?

675
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:33,908
Quit pestering yourself. It ain't no use.

676
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:36,942
Look at that there big woman.

677
00:53:37,017 --> 00:53:40,919
Why don't you have a turn with her, Alvin?
Take you back to your log rolling days.

678
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:42,455
"Business is business."

679
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:46,117
Well, once around her
is twice around Bear Mountain.

680
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:50,162
Look at Buck here, Alvin.
He's plumb tuckered out.

681
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,596
- I sure am.
- Well, he might be,

682
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:55,561
dancing around a whole passel of women
that-a-way.

683
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:57,398
- Another bottle, Marter.
- Sure.

684
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:59,098
That land were mine.

685
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:01,832
Ain't nobody gonna get it away from me.

686
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:07,078
I'd sure like to see you
toad-hop her about, Alvin.

687
00:54:07,147 --> 00:54:09,479
I'm a-drinking against Nate Tomkins.

688
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:12,347
Now, how about that there big woman?

689
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:14,747
Alvin, you better be a-staying here.

690
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:16,584
- Let go of me.
- We'll go along with you.

691
00:54:16,656 --> 00:54:18,783
What I got to do is my own.

692
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:30,064
It sure ain't a good night for a killing.

693
00:54:31,238 --> 00:54:33,866
There's no stopping him now, I reckon.

694
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:51,901
Give me that old time religion.

695
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:29,869
- Howdy, Mr. Tomkins.
- Look here. Stand where you are.

696
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,501
Don't you come any closer.

697
00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:34,672
- Mr. Tomkins, I just want to...
- Come closer and I'll hit you.

698
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:37,080
No need of getting riled, Mr. Tomkins.

699
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,608
- I ain't a-Iooking for no trouble with you.
- What you doing around here?

700
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,212
- Well, I want to talk to you about...
- What about?

701
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,621
About Abraham.

702
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:47,524
That mule's legally mine.
You ain't got no claim on him.

703
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:48,925
Well, I ain't denying he's yours...

704
00:58:48,995 --> 00:58:53,022
Stay where you are if you don't want to be
laid out in two pieces.

705
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:56,934
Well, I was a-figuring
on a-buying Abraham back.

706
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:59,437
- Buying him back?
- Yes, sir.

707
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:01,564
My mule's kind of poorly,

708
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:05,270
and something done happened to him
and I sure need a mule.

709
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,274
- Are you meaning it?
- Yes, sir.

710
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:10,342
No hard feelings?

711
00:59:10,784 --> 00:59:14,584
- Shucks, no, Mr. Tomkins.
- Well, I'll be damned.

712
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:17,919
And... And there's one more thing.

713
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:22,492
I'm asking your forgiveness
for a-flaring up at you the way I done.

714
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:25,360
It were Satan a-speaking out of me.

715
00:59:28,201 --> 00:59:31,967
Zeke was a-telling me, but I...
I couldn't believe him.

716
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:34,199
- About what?
- That you got religion.

717
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:37,835
- Well, that's a fact, Mr. Tomkins.
- Well, I'll be damned.

718
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:40,936
Well, I sure would like to be a-buying
that there mule back.

719
00:59:41,014 --> 00:59:42,379
- You would, huh?
- Yeah.

720
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:45,543
- How much would you be asking for him?
- Well, let's see.

721
00:59:45,618 --> 00:59:48,678
You said he was worth $40
and I allowed you $30.

722
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:49,949
That's right.

723
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:53,481
Well, you can have him back for $20.

724
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:57,660
Mr. Tomkins, Abraham's worth
a sight more than that.

725
00:59:57,731 --> 00:59:58,925
Maybe he is,

726
00:59:58,998 --> 01:00:03,958
but seeing as how I'm trying to do
the fair and square thing, Alvin, $20.

727
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:10,173
I reckon I know what you're thinking.
It's more blessed to give than to receive.

728
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:12,540
Maybe. Come on, get your mule.

729
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,972
And another thing, I'm gonna
give you back the clock you sold me.

730
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:18,381
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it don't run nohow.

731
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:37,793
- Howdy, Mr. Andrews.
- Howdy.

732
01:00:37,871 --> 01:00:40,738
I'd kind of like to see zeb,
are he hereabout?

733
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,172
Maybe he is.

734
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:44,877
I sure would like to have words with him.

735
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:48,871
You coming peaceful?

736
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:52,384
Yes, sir, Mr. Andrews.
I ain't looking for no trouble.

737
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:55,010
Zeb. Come out of there.

738
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:58,056
There he be.

739
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:01,019
Howdy.

740
01:01:01,394 --> 01:01:04,158
What you'd be wanting with me,
Alvin York?

741
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:07,763
I want to talk to you, zeb, about...
About that there piece of land.

742
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:09,699
I bought it, it's mine.

743
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:11,735
I know it, but...

744
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:13,966
Sure it's yours, zeb, but...

745
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:18,308
But Nate Tomkins was...
Was a-figuring that...

746
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:21,176
I ain't caring
what Nate Tomkins was a-figuring.

747
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:25,513
- Well, Nate was just thinking...
- It's mine and I'm gonna keep it.

748
01:01:25,585 --> 01:01:28,418
Well, sure it's yours, zeb,
but if you'll only allow me to talk...

749
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:30,581
Ain't nobody a-holding you.

750
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,551
Oh, yes, they are.

751
01:01:33,326 --> 01:01:36,261
Well, anyway, Nate was a-thinking
that your being so busy here,

752
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,797
maybe you need some extra help
on the other piece of land.

753
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:42,665
- Well, what's that got to do with you?
- Well, I'm asking you for the job.

754
01:01:42,735 --> 01:01:47,195
- You mean you're aiming to work for me?
- I'd be if you allow me.

755
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,470
Well, shucks. That sure got me stumped.

756
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:54,145
I was a-buying that land just to spite you.

757
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:57,409
Well, I sure don't blame you none.

758
01:01:57,917 --> 01:02:01,080
Well, maybe we can figure it
so you can sharecrop the piece.

759
01:02:01,154 --> 01:02:03,054
Then you kind of be a-working for yourself.

760
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:04,851
No, I ain't asking for anything extra, zeb.

761
01:02:04,924 --> 01:02:08,155
Well, if you can farm that bottomland
like you've been doing the top,

762
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:11,755
I reckon that land will be yours
in a couple of seasons.

763
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:15,595
Well, with the help of the Lord,
I'll make you a good crop.

764
01:02:16,102 --> 01:02:17,330
Like I'm saying, Miss Gracie,

765
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:20,861
I ain't ever seen a prettier piece of land
than that there Andrews farm.

766
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,670
Corn is thicker than fur on a squirrel.

767
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,372
And I seen eight beef critters
a-grazing in the pasture there.

768
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:29,381
That are a lot of critters.

769
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:33,510
And that zeb Andrews
sure are a forgiving man.

770
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,611
- Is he?
- Yes, sir.

771
01:02:35,822 --> 01:02:37,483
Be sitting, Alvin.

772
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:42,454
- And a Christian man, if I ever seen one.
- Reckon so.

773
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:45,259
What I done to him that night
we were visiting you weren't right.

774
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:47,856
The devil was a-pushing me from behind.

775
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:50,334
It were too dark. I couldn't see.

776
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:53,597
I didn't have no call
to come twixt you and him.

777
01:02:54,173 --> 01:02:56,368
What are you getting at, Alvin York?

778
01:02:56,476 --> 01:02:58,808
All I'm aiming to say, Miss Gracie, is,

779
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:02,644
a upstanding man like zeb Andrews
would make a girl a right smart husband.

780
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:04,205
- What's that?
- And...

781
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:08,914
And if you change your mind about zeb,
well, I reckon I could...

782
01:03:08,988 --> 01:03:12,651
- You could what?
- I could rightly understand.

783
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:15,717
Oh, you could, could you?

784
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:19,021
Lookee here, Alvin York,

785
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:21,262
if I wanted zeb Andrews for a husband,

786
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:23,859
I reckon I could get him
without your acting so noble.

787
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:26,132
- I done kissed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

788
01:03:26,205 --> 01:03:28,799
Well, I don't go around kissing men
I ain't gonna be a-marrying.

789
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:30,433
Now you be a-listening to me.

790
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,705
- Am I marrying a piece of land?
- Yes. No.

791
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:33,905
- Or a beef critter?
- No.

792
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,038
Or a field of corn?

793
01:03:35,114 --> 01:03:37,605
No, it's you I'm marrying,
ain't nobody else in this here world.

794
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:38,742
- Are you hearing me?
- Yes.

795
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:40,843
Well, then don't you talk that way
to me again, Alvin!

796
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,717
- No.
- Don't you ever!

797
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,482
Oh!

798
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:54,823
The Lord sure do move
in mysterious ways.

799
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:01,400
So that's what the Lord done said to Cain
when he done killed Abel.

800
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:05,307
It was a way of telling him
that he wouldn't get no crops no more.

801
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,846
And anybody that's a farmer
knows what that means.

802
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:11,077
Alvin, how do you know that it happened
just that-a-way?

803
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,015
A-seeing how you weren't there.

804
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:14,519
Well, the Book says so.

805
01:04:14,587 --> 01:04:18,580
And there ain't nothing written
in the Book that ain't the truth.

806
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,225
So, a long time after that

807
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:27,755
when the Lord was a-giving Moses
the Ten Commandments,

808
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:31,198
he was a-saying, "Thou shalt not kill."

809
01:04:31,738 --> 01:04:33,433
Now... Now go ahead with the reading.

810
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:37,537
Hey! Hey! War! Hey!

811
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,008
Hey! Pastor Pile!

812
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,439
- What's happened, Luke?
- It's war.

813
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:45,484
President Wilson done declared war
against Germany.

814
01:04:45,551 --> 01:04:47,041
- You don't say?
- Yes, sir.

815
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,917
It says so right here in this here paper.

816
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:04,694
Here you are, Jim.
I reckon I won't wait to be drafted.

817
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:07,899
- I'm joining up as soon as the corn's in.
- Me, too.

818
01:05:07,974 --> 01:05:11,705
Attaboy, Tom. I heard my daddy talk
about fighting Yankees.

819
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:14,872
And my granddaddy
done fought in the Revolution.

820
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:17,481
Sure wish I was a young fellow.

821
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:20,847
Well, come along, zeke.
You load 'em and I'll shoot 'em.

822
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:24,116
- Hi, Alvin.
- Hi, Alvin.

823
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,782
Hey, Alvin, what about you?

824
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:28,418
You joining up now
or you waiting to be called?

825
01:05:28,494 --> 01:05:30,394
I reckon I'm a-waiting.

826
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,693
- Howdy, Ike.
- Hi, Alvin.

827
01:05:35,368 --> 01:05:36,801
Howdy, Alvin.

828
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:40,032
Good morning, Pastor.
Reckon I need some coal oil.

829
01:05:40,173 --> 01:05:43,609
I'm glad you come in, Alvin.
I was gonna send for you.

830
01:05:43,943 --> 01:05:45,171
You was?

831
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:49,741
- You ain't registered yet, have you, Alvin?
- Of course I ain't.

832
01:05:49,816 --> 01:05:52,717
Is that the new seed
you was gonna send for?

833
01:05:56,823 --> 01:05:59,758
It's Tuesday, Alvin. You only got till 6:00.

834
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:01,817
I ain't a-gonna register.

835
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:04,292
Come here.

836
01:06:05,898 --> 01:06:10,597
- You gotta register, Alvin.
- I ain't a-going to. I ain't a-going to war.

837
01:06:11,604 --> 01:06:14,596
War is killing
and the Book's against killing.

838
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:17,470
So war is against the Book.

839
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:19,771
You're plumb right, Alvin.

840
01:06:19,846 --> 01:06:22,872
You got the using kind of religion,
not the meetinghouse kind, but you...

841
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:25,577
- The kind I got's the kind you teached me.
- I know that.

842
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:28,711
And I hate to be telling you, but
I don't want to see you get in no trouble.

843
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:29,812
Now, you got to register

844
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:31,379
and there ain't no way
you can get out of it.

845
01:06:31,457 --> 01:06:34,858
You mean they can make you go to war
even if it's against what you think is right?

846
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:38,727
No, no, no, they won't make you do that.
It's what I want to tell you.

847
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:40,095
Come here.

848
01:06:42,135 --> 01:06:43,659
It's right here.

849
01:06:44,604 --> 01:06:45,969
Let me see.

850
01:06:46,372 --> 01:06:50,468
Now, wait a minute. Here.
There it is right there, see?

851
01:06:50,777 --> 01:06:53,644
"Members of well-recognized
religious sects

852
01:06:53,713 --> 01:06:57,615
"whose existent creed
forbids its members to participate in war

853
01:06:57,683 --> 01:07:01,483
"are entitled to request exemption
from military service."

854
01:07:01,554 --> 01:07:03,454
What... What's that there exemption?

855
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:07,391
Well, that, it means,
if you're exempted, you don't have to go.

856
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,189
Well, how do I get this exemption?

857
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:12,493
Well, you got to write a letter
to the draft board.

858
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:15,632
- Is that all there is to it?
- Yep.

859
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:20,063
Well. Well, sure I'll register.
Will you write the letter for me?

860
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:23,165
Why, I'd be glad to, Alvin.
Come on over here.

861
01:07:24,977 --> 01:07:27,969
"Therefore, we find
that we can't consider your church

862
01:07:28,047 --> 01:07:29,776
"a well-recognized religious sect,

863
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:33,216
"organized and existing, May 18, 1917.

864
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:37,923
"We find further, that it has
no special creed except the Bible,

865
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:41,289
"which can be interpreted
by its members as they choose.

866
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,590
"And finally, there's nothing
in the creed of the church,

867
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:46,632
"expressly forbidding its members
to participate in war.

868
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:50,032
"Therefore your application for exemption
is denied."

869
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:55,300
Is this here the last word
or has he got some place to appeal?

870
01:07:55,374 --> 01:07:57,638
He can appeal to
the District Board at Nashville

871
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:00,110
and finally to the General Board
in Washington.

872
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:02,010
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

873
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:03,571
You're welcome.

874
01:08:05,685 --> 01:08:09,086
I'll be a-writing 'em appeals for you,
Alvin, so don't you be worrying.

875
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:10,747
Oh, I ain't a-worrying.

876
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:18,730
We'll be a-fixing this here bridge.

877
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:30,967
There it is.

878
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:34,706
So, we'll be a-building the house
right over there by that tree.

879
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:37,112
And the big room is gonna be...

880
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:42,418
The big room is gonna be right...
Right here in front, just like this.

881
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:44,747
And it's gonna have three windows.

882
01:08:44,824 --> 01:08:48,988
And the kitchen will be here,
and it's gonna be good and big, too.

883
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:51,961
- And there'll be a stove.
- Where?

884
01:08:52,031 --> 01:08:54,022
Well, right about there.

885
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,528
And I'm gonna build you one of 'em sinks.

886
01:08:56,602 --> 01:08:58,695
And I'm gonna give you a pump,
so you won't have to carry

887
01:08:58,771 --> 01:08:59,863
no water from the springs.

888
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:01,804
- A pump, Alvin?
- Sure.

889
01:09:01,908 --> 01:09:03,773
Alvin, pumps costs a heap of money.

890
01:09:03,843 --> 01:09:07,643
Well, we're gonna have curtains in the
windows and carpets on the floors.

891
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:09,305
And it ain't gonna take very long either

892
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:11,907
if the Lord keeps a-showering
his blessings on me.

893
01:09:11,984 --> 01:09:14,145
Won't take more than two, three years,
I reckon.

894
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,816
Just to think, in two, three years,
a house right there where we're looking.

895
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:22,451
And it will be our house.

896
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:25,824
- Alvin.
- What do you want?

897
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:28,258
Pastor Pile wants to see you, Alvin.

898
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:30,598
Well, Gracie and me
is kind of busy right now.

899
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,968
Well, tell him I'll stop by the store
on the way home.

900
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:35,166
He said he wants to see you right off.

901
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:36,765
He said you best be a-coming.

902
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:39,072
Well, tell him I'll be there.

903
01:09:39,445 --> 01:09:41,845
Shucks, just when we was having fun.

904
01:09:41,914 --> 01:09:44,144
Would you be
a-telling me again sometime?

905
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:45,581
I sure will.

906
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,925
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Alvin.

907
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:02,461
I got right bad news for you.

908
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:05,402
Word just come.
They're a-taking you for the army.

909
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:06,733
Well, that can't be.

910
01:10:06,806 --> 01:10:09,934
That letter we done sent to Washington,
says that I was against fighting and...

911
01:10:10,009 --> 01:10:12,000
They ain't going to exempt you, Alvin.

912
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:15,070
You got to report to Nashville
tomorrow night.

913
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:16,940
I ain't a-going.

914
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:21,484
You ain't got no choice.
This was the last appeal.

915
01:10:21,554 --> 01:10:24,352
I don't care about that. I ain't a-going.

916
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,588
You've got to go, Alvin. It's the law.

917
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,718
What?

918
01:10:28,794 --> 01:10:31,160
What kind of law is it
that says a man's got to go

919
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:33,323
against the Book and its teachings?

920
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:36,232
Well, I reckon there ain't no answer, but,

921
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,368
if you don't go,
they'll be a-coming after you.

922
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:42,839
Well, they won't get me.
I'll go back in 'em hills.

923
01:10:42,975 --> 01:10:44,738
Yeah, and they'll put hounds on your trail,

924
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,370
and they'll follow you
no matter how far back you go.

925
01:10:47,446 --> 01:10:52,349
Then they'd better not catch up with me,
'cause they'll be a-wishing they hadn't. I...

926
01:10:57,256 --> 01:11:00,521
Sorry, Pastor, I... Them's sinful words.

927
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:03,323
I wasn't thinking of what I was saying.

928
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:06,092
I'll go.

929
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:12,268
War's away to the other side
of the ocean, Alvin.

930
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:15,798
Lots of things can happen
before you get there.

931
01:11:16,976 --> 01:11:21,538
You put your trust in the Lord
and he'll look out for you.

932
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:23,514
I done forgot the Lord.

933
01:11:25,184 --> 01:11:27,778
I ain't never gonna forget him again.

934
01:11:30,656 --> 01:11:32,180
Goodbye, Alvin.

935
01:11:50,476 --> 01:11:51,636
Well...

936
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:59,441
I reckon these'll do till I get fixed up
in government clothes.

937
01:12:10,796 --> 01:12:13,526
The corn's doing right good
on the south hill.

938
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:16,124
It might need a little extra hoeing.

939
01:12:20,706 --> 01:12:23,732
Mule's at the gate.
You got a long ways to go.

940
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:29,238
Well, you'll be taking care of things
from now on, George.

941
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:30,577
Sure will.

942
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:33,447
I guess you'll be needing a man-sized gun.

943
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,521
- You can have my rifle.
- I'm a-thanking you.

944
01:12:41,327 --> 01:12:42,487
Well...

945
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,395
I'm going.

946
01:12:51,337 --> 01:12:55,137
I had to see you again, Alvin. I just had to.

947
01:12:58,377 --> 01:12:59,742
Now, now...

948
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,515
No, no, don't you be looking at me, please.

949
01:13:08,988 --> 01:13:11,980
Don't want you to be
remembering me like this.

950
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:15,093
Close your eyes, please?

951
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:17,089
Yessum.

952
01:13:18,197 --> 01:13:20,222
- Are they closed?
- Yes.

953
01:13:31,277 --> 01:13:32,642
Bye, Alvin.

954
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:39,581
I'll be a-coming back.

955
01:14:10,115 --> 01:14:11,480
Bye, Alvin.

956
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:15,017
I'll be a-coming back.

957
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:22,150
Ma.

958
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:25,655
What are they a-fighting for?

959
01:14:26,298 --> 01:14:28,425
I don't rightly know, child.

960
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:32,662
I don't rightly know.

961
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:45,543
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.

962
01:14:45,618 --> 01:14:47,017
Okay, Sarge.

963
01:14:49,622 --> 01:14:53,524
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon
you got there, it's a shovel.

964
01:14:53,592 --> 01:14:55,753
- Lay into it.
- Okay, General.

965
01:14:55,894 --> 01:14:57,361
Dig, soldiers, dig.

966
01:14:57,596 --> 01:14:59,188
Dig your way straight down to China.

967
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:00,994
- Okay, Sarge.
- China?

968
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:05,497
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.

969
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:11,476
Parsons, Sergeant Early.

970
01:15:12,678 --> 01:15:13,940
Yes, sir.

971
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:16,147
Which one of your men is York?

972
01:15:16,215 --> 01:15:18,740
He is the big, lanky fellow,
fourth from the end, sir.

973
01:15:18,817 --> 01:15:21,411
- Having any trouble with him?
- No, sir. Why?

974
01:15:21,754 --> 01:15:24,484
He's down here
as a conscientious objector.

975
01:15:24,556 --> 01:15:26,751
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.

976
01:15:26,825 --> 01:15:28,087
Yes, sir.

977
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:35,664
That'll be a big help.

978
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:37,825
Dig. Dig. Dig.

979
01:15:39,171 --> 01:15:43,608
I've been working in a subway all my life,
never thought about the guys that dug it.

980
01:15:43,676 --> 01:15:46,907
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.

981
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:48,879
- Subway you say?
- Yeah.

982
01:15:49,014 --> 01:15:50,879
What's this here subway
you're talking about?

983
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:53,611
You mean to say you don't know
what a subway is? That guy kidding?

984
01:15:53,686 --> 01:15:55,779
No, they don't have subways
where he comes from, I guess.

985
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:58,414
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?

986
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:01,516
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.

987
01:16:01,694 --> 01:16:03,685
- Where is that?
- Tennessee.

988
01:16:03,929 --> 01:16:05,658
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?

989
01:16:05,731 --> 01:16:08,996
- Ain't never even heard of one.
- You never... What? Heard?

990
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:10,968
Heard? What kind of talk is that?

991
01:16:11,036 --> 01:16:13,334
Do they all talk that kind of English
where you come from?

992
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:17,466
Well, there ain't any English people
down our way, just Americans.

993
01:16:17,643 --> 01:16:20,840
Well, look, a subway is a big hole
in the ground, see?

994
01:16:20,946 --> 01:16:22,607
It goes for miles.

995
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:25,013
- Straight down?
- Yeah... No.

996
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:27,451
It doesn't go straight down,
it goes this way.

997
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,111
- Oh, this a-way?
- Yeah.

998
01:16:29,221 --> 01:16:31,382
- Under the ground?
- Under the ground.

999
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:34,221
- And trains run through it.
- They run through it?

1000
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:36,193
- Yeah.
- Steam cars?

1001
01:16:36,261 --> 01:16:38,593
Steam... No. Steam cars.

1002
01:16:38,664 --> 01:16:41,599
- They're electric, Alvin.
- I sure would like to see one of 'em.

1003
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:43,999
You see, they have to run trains
under the ground in New York,

1004
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:46,333
- because it's so crowded.
- Crowded? I'll say.

1005
01:16:46,405 --> 01:16:48,896
Look, it's the rush hour,
the Bronx Express is just pulling in.

1006
01:16:48,974 --> 01:16:50,965
I'm standing on the platform,
holding back the mob.

1007
01:16:51,043 --> 01:16:53,876
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?

1008
01:16:53,946 --> 01:16:55,709
Just a word now and then.

1009
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:58,909
Well, you see, the people are just coming
from work and they wanna get home, see,

1010
01:16:58,984 --> 01:17:00,542
and they wanna get into the cars
all together.

1011
01:17:00,619 --> 01:17:02,348
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.

1012
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:06,187
Well, anyway, the doors open up and
now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.

1013
01:17:06,258 --> 01:17:07,782
"Move back in the cars," I yell.

1014
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,761
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."

1015
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:14,230
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used
to pack them in like sardines in a can.

1016
01:17:14,299 --> 01:17:15,527
That's why they call me "Pusher."

1017
01:17:15,601 --> 01:17:17,466
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.

1018
01:17:17,536 --> 01:17:19,504
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:23,304
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.

1020
01:17:23,509 --> 01:17:26,444
- 2-4-1-8-0-0.
- Zaranopolis Nick.

1021
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,580
2-4-1-8-0-1.

1022
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:33,413
- 2-4-1-8-0-1.
- Ross, Michael T.

1023
01:17:33,485 --> 01:17:35,578
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?

1024
01:17:35,654 --> 01:17:38,418
- Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
- Sure.

1025
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:43,223
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.

1026
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,520
York, Alvin C.

1027
01:17:46,932 --> 01:17:48,832
Anything wrong with it?

1028
01:17:49,568 --> 01:17:51,695
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.

1029
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:55,934
I thought maybe you might have
some conscientious objections to it.

1030
01:17:56,141 --> 01:17:57,768
No, sir, I ain't.

1031
01:17:57,876 --> 01:18:01,437
Careful you don't kill anybody with it
till we get to France.

1032
01:18:01,513 --> 01:18:03,538
- Next man.
- There you are, York.

1033
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:08,143
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.

1034
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,744
Thomas, Bert E.

1035
01:18:17,963 --> 01:18:20,022
Boy, look at that shine,
is that clean or is that clean?

1036
01:18:20,098 --> 01:18:22,191
Look, Sarge, you can eat
right off the trigger.

1037
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:23,427
Not bad.

1038
01:18:26,572 --> 01:18:27,766
You call that clean?

1039
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,274
- What's the matter with it?
- Look.

1040
01:18:31,009 --> 01:18:33,705
- I don't see nothing.
- It's full of grease.

1041
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:35,440
Won't that make the bullet
come out faster?

1042
01:18:35,514 --> 01:18:36,742
Clean it.

1043
01:18:37,749 --> 01:18:39,717
That's a good job, York.

1044
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:41,886
Did you ever clean a rifle before?

1045
01:18:41,954 --> 01:18:45,617
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.

1046
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:47,352
So you've got a gun of your own,
have you?

1047
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:50,361
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't think you'd have one.

1048
01:19:01,106 --> 01:19:03,836
Well, the next time get your sling
a little higher on your arm.

1049
01:19:03,909 --> 01:19:05,035
Okay.

1050
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,906
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.

1051
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:11,643
Now, remember, you guys,
you're using real, live ammunition.

1052
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:15,710
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.

1053
01:19:15,888 --> 01:19:17,879
So don't start murdering each other.

1054
01:19:17,956 --> 01:19:20,686
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.

1055
01:19:20,759 --> 01:19:22,386
Ready, number 30.

1056
01:19:23,595 --> 01:19:25,722
Not yet, we'll try it first.

1057
01:19:27,165 --> 01:19:30,066
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.

1058
01:19:30,168 --> 01:19:31,601
Take a deep breath.

1059
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:34,002
Blow, let a little of it out.

1060
01:19:34,706 --> 01:19:35,934
Hold it.

1061
01:19:36,008 --> 01:19:38,408
Remember, keep your sights
on the center of the bull's-eye.

1062
01:19:38,477 --> 01:19:40,445
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.

1063
01:19:40,512 --> 01:19:43,948
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.

1064
01:19:44,016 --> 01:19:46,484
Ready? Aim.

1065
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:50,512
I can't hold it no more.

1066
01:19:50,589 --> 01:19:52,989
All right, Ross, take another one.

1067
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,550
Aim.

1068
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:56,986
Fire.

1069
01:19:57,062 --> 01:20:00,031
Look, Ross, you had your thumb
sticking straight up in the air.

1070
01:20:00,098 --> 01:20:01,258
Just like that.

1071
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,732
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.

1072
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:05,099
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?

1073
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,535
- Yeah.
- Here.

1074
01:20:07,573 --> 01:20:08,631
Load.

1075
01:20:10,642 --> 01:20:11,666
Aim.

1076
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:15,978
- Fire.
- Oh, my eye.

1077
01:20:16,481 --> 01:20:18,506
Maybe that will teach you
to keep your thumb down.

1078
01:20:18,584 --> 01:20:21,951
That's something
for the rest of you men to remember.

1079
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,684
- A miss.
- Miss.

1080
01:20:30,195 --> 01:20:31,890
Ready on number 29.

1081
01:20:32,464 --> 01:20:33,863
Ready on 29.

1082
01:20:33,932 --> 01:20:35,263
Ready, 29.

1083
01:20:37,469 --> 01:20:40,370
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.

1084
01:20:40,472 --> 01:20:42,463
Aim. Fire.

1085
01:20:44,543 --> 01:20:47,137
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.

1086
01:20:47,212 --> 01:20:49,737
All right, next time get that sling
a little higher on your arm.

1087
01:20:49,815 --> 01:20:51,305
Press your cheek
a little closer to the stock.

1088
01:20:51,383 --> 01:20:52,407
Yes, sir.

1089
01:20:52,484 --> 01:20:55,385
Make sure that front sight
divides the rear sight in half.

1090
01:20:55,454 --> 01:20:57,615
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.

1091
01:20:57,689 --> 01:20:59,782
You reckon you know about that, do you?

1092
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:01,485
We'll see. Here.

1093
01:21:03,829 --> 01:21:05,729
Load. Aim.

1094
01:21:10,435 --> 01:21:11,459
Fire.

1095
01:21:15,173 --> 01:21:16,902
- A miss!
- Miss.

1096
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:21,235
So you know about sighting, do you?

1097
01:21:21,446 --> 01:21:23,880
I sure thought I cut plumb center
that time.

1098
01:21:23,949 --> 01:21:25,382
You did, huh?

1099
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:29,113
I can't no ways see how I can miss
that whole great big target.

1100
01:21:29,187 --> 01:21:31,781
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.

1101
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:34,015
Re-mark for 29.

1102
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:35,821
Re-mark, 29.

1103
01:21:36,261 --> 01:21:38,320
Oh, I didn't see that one.

1104
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,992
- A bull's-eye, 4:00.
- Bull's-eye.

1105
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:48,737
I can't figure out how I got
way down there on the edge.

1106
01:21:48,807 --> 01:21:52,174
Well, I reckon I can do a little better
when I get used to this here rifle gun.

1107
01:21:52,244 --> 01:21:54,644
Here's five chances to do better.

1108
01:21:59,951 --> 01:22:01,509
Fire when ready.

1109
01:22:03,789 --> 01:22:06,849
Hey, what are you wetting
that front sight for?

1110
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:09,656
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.

1111
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:13,391
I always wet my sights
when I'm fixing to do some shooting.

1112
01:22:13,965 --> 01:22:15,990
Okay, do some shooting.

1113
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:27,938
- Bull's-eye, dead center.
- Bull's-eye.

1114
01:22:28,046 --> 01:22:30,310
Okay, York. You're on your own.

1115
01:22:36,655 --> 01:22:39,146
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

1116
01:22:44,563 --> 01:22:46,793
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

1117
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:54,195
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

1118
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:00,836
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.

1119
01:23:00,912 --> 01:23:02,903
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.

1120
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:05,006
Let's see that target, Sergeant.

1121
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:08,111
Bring 29 to the firing line.

1122
01:23:13,592 --> 01:23:16,720
There's the first shot,
and here's the other five here.

1123
01:23:16,795 --> 01:23:19,696
I reckon that there gun
shoots a might to the right.

1124
01:23:19,765 --> 01:23:22,256
Where did you learn to shoot, York?

1125
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:25,063
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.

1126
01:23:25,137 --> 01:23:28,868
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.

1127
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:31,272
But they was exaggerating some.

1128
01:23:33,378 --> 01:23:37,371
Now, supposing these here cartridges
is a flock of wild turkeys,

1129
01:23:37,449 --> 01:23:40,441
a-flying across the ridge
coming this a-way, see, right at me.

1130
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:42,146
Now, which one of them
would you shoot first?

1131
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,518
I'd take a crack at all of 'em
and trust to luck.

1132
01:23:44,589 --> 01:23:46,557
Well, you wouldn't have no luck
that way, Pusher.

1133
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:49,458
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.

1134
01:23:50,061 --> 01:23:53,087
- The what?
- The motorman. The guy out in front.

1135
01:23:53,598 --> 01:23:56,362
Well, that ain't right either,
if you wanna get more than one turkey.

1136
01:23:56,434 --> 01:23:58,163
Now, which one of them's
got the most meat on him?

1137
01:23:58,236 --> 01:23:59,828
Yeah, what's the answer?

1138
01:23:59,905 --> 01:24:02,135
Well, now, if you shoot this one here,
the leader,

1139
01:24:02,207 --> 01:24:04,505
the rest of 'em will see him drop
and fly off, see?

1140
01:24:04,576 --> 01:24:07,773
So, you draw down
on the last turkey here,

1141
01:24:08,446 --> 01:24:10,539
and then the next one, see?

1142
01:24:10,816 --> 01:24:13,250
Kind of coming from back to front.

1143
01:24:13,685 --> 01:24:16,176
Then the rest of 'em won't know
they're being hit.

1144
01:24:16,254 --> 01:24:17,346
And, if...

1145
01:24:17,422 --> 01:24:20,323
Of course, they might flare off some
when the shooting starts,

1146
01:24:20,392 --> 01:24:22,690
but if a fellow's got himself
a repeating rifle,

1147
01:24:22,761 --> 01:24:24,752
he's got a good chance
of getting the whole flock.

1148
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:27,492
- Sounds all right.
- Turkeys sure is dumb animals.

1149
01:24:27,566 --> 01:24:30,501
Seems you picked up a good bit
down in the hills, Alvin.

1150
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:33,037
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting
knows that.

1151
01:24:33,104 --> 01:24:36,301
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.

1152
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:39,036
- Yes, sir.
- What have you been up to now?

1153
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:42,375
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.

1154
01:24:42,447 --> 01:24:43,505
It's your move.

1155
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:49,815
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Yes, York. At ease.

1156
01:24:50,622 --> 01:24:54,991
York, Captain Danforth has just
handed me a report concerning you,

1157
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,960
made by your company sergeant.

1158
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:58,290
Yes, sir?

1159
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:01,024
You have a very excellent camp record.

1160
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:04,301
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.

1161
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:08,032
You applied for exemption, I believe,
as a conscientious objector.

1162
01:25:08,106 --> 01:25:09,368
Yes, sir.

1163
01:25:09,574 --> 01:25:12,099
Well, I think we can disregard that.

1164
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:16,176
York, Sergeant Parsons
recommends your promotion

1165
01:25:16,248 --> 01:25:18,307
to the rank of corporal with special detail

1166
01:25:18,383 --> 01:25:21,011
as instructor in target practice.

1167
01:25:21,586 --> 01:25:24,054
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.

1168
01:25:24,122 --> 01:25:26,090
I congratulate you, York.

1169
01:25:27,259 --> 01:25:31,252
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.

1170
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:35,224
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot
the best I can,

1171
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,632
like I already done Pusher and Bert.

1172
01:25:37,702 --> 01:25:42,298
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir,
but,

1173
01:25:43,575 --> 01:25:46,442
well, I don't want to be no corporal.

1174
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:49,605
- What's that?
- I said I don't want to be no corporal.

1175
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:52,841
- Why not?
- Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.

1176
01:25:53,018 --> 01:25:54,679
Well, you see, I...

1177
01:25:54,753 --> 01:25:57,483
Is it because of your
religious convictions, York?

1178
01:25:57,555 --> 01:25:59,284
Yes, sir. That's it.

1179
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:02,123
You see, I believe in the Bible,

1180
01:26:02,394 --> 01:26:07,058
and I'm a-believing
that this here life we're living

1181
01:26:07,132 --> 01:26:09,566
is something the Lord done give us.

1182
01:26:09,634 --> 01:26:12,432
And we got to be a-living it
the best we can.

1183
01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:16,497
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks

1184
01:26:16,574 --> 01:26:20,908
ain't no part of what he was intending
for us to be a-doing here.

1185
01:26:22,647 --> 01:26:24,945
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.

1186
01:26:25,016 --> 01:26:26,984
York, with your permission, Major?

1187
01:26:27,052 --> 01:26:29,543
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.

1188
01:26:30,155 --> 01:26:32,885
You... You say you believe in the Bible?

1189
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,553
Yes, sir.

1190
01:26:34,693 --> 01:26:36,285
Well, I do, too.

1191
01:26:36,695 --> 01:26:39,926
But do you believe that the Bible means
that a man shouldn't fight

1192
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:42,364
for what he believes to be right?

1193
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:44,396
Well, it done said,

1194
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:46,901
"Blessed are the peacemakers."

1195
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:48,667
Yes, I know, but...

1196
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:52,700
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke,

1197
01:26:53,111 --> 01:26:57,810
where he says, "He that hath no sword,
let him sell his garment, and buy one"?

1198
01:26:57,882 --> 01:26:59,713
He said that to Peter.

1199
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:02,209
But he doesn't stop Peter
from using his sword.

1200
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:06,417
He said, "Them that lives by the sword
will be a-perishing by the sword."

1201
01:27:06,491 --> 01:27:08,118
That were further on.

1202
01:27:08,259 --> 01:27:11,456
- Yes, I remember, but...
- No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.

1203
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:13,721
But according to St. John,

1204
01:27:13,999 --> 01:27:17,298
he said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

1205
01:27:17,702 --> 01:27:21,001
"If my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servant fight."

1206
01:27:21,072 --> 01:27:22,903
Well, that's just the point, Captain.

1207
01:27:22,974 --> 01:27:26,068
He done said
his kingdom were not of this world.

1208
01:27:26,378 --> 01:27:28,471
And that... That is different.

1209
01:27:28,546 --> 01:27:31,071
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, Captain.

1210
01:27:31,282 --> 01:27:33,944
York, have you ever read this?

1211
01:27:34,285 --> 01:27:36,583
<i>"History of the United States."</i>

1212
01:27:39,758 --> 01:27:41,885
It sure is a lot of writing.

1213
01:27:46,865 --> 01:27:48,628
- Daniel Boone?
- Yeah.

1214
01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:50,698
You know about him?

1215
01:27:50,769 --> 01:27:53,169
Well, everybody down our way
knows about Daniel Boone.

1216
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:55,399
First man into
the Valley of the Three Forks.

1217
01:27:55,473 --> 01:27:58,670
Yes, he was quite a man,
one of the greatest.

1218
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:02,279
And that book's full of great men.

1219
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:08,080
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for

1220
01:28:08,153 --> 01:28:10,451
when he went out alone
into the wilderness?

1221
01:28:10,522 --> 01:28:12,922
Well, I never thought much on it.

1222
01:28:13,324 --> 01:28:15,519
Was he looking for new lands?

1223
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,423
- Might be.
- Maybe.

1224
01:28:18,363 --> 01:28:20,331
Maybe for something more.

1225
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:25,365
Something that a man just can't see
with his eyes or hold in his hands.

1226
01:28:26,638 --> 01:28:30,074
Something that some men don't even
know they have until they've lost it.

1227
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:32,473
- Yes, sir.
- To be free.

1228
01:28:34,112 --> 01:28:36,512
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.

1229
01:28:37,315 --> 01:28:39,442
I think that's what he wanted.

1230
01:28:39,517 --> 01:28:43,248
I think that's what sent Boone
into your Tennessee country.

1231
01:28:43,555 --> 01:28:46,023
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?

1232
01:28:46,091 --> 01:28:47,217
Yep.

1233
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:51,420
That's the story of a whole people's
struggle for freedom

1234
01:28:51,496 --> 01:28:53,964
from the very beginning until now.

1235
01:28:54,032 --> 01:28:56,125
For we're still struggling.

1236
01:28:56,801 --> 01:28:58,826
It's quite a story, York.

1237
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:02,567
How they all got together
and set up a government,

1238
01:29:03,775 --> 01:29:07,438
whereby all men were pledged
to defend the rights of each man,

1239
01:29:07,512 --> 01:29:10,481
and each man
to defend the rights of all men.

1240
01:29:11,149 --> 01:29:14,550
We call it a government of the people,

1241
01:29:15,386 --> 01:29:18,219
by the people and for the people.

1242
01:29:20,425 --> 01:29:23,326
Why, I never knowed
it was all written down.

1243
01:29:23,661 --> 01:29:26,425
- You're a religious man, York.
- Yes, sir.

1244
01:29:27,732 --> 01:29:29,893
You want to worship God
in your own way.

1245
01:29:29,968 --> 01:29:31,128
Yes, sir.

1246
01:29:31,202 --> 01:29:33,295
- You're a farmer?
- Yes, sir.

1247
01:29:33,404 --> 01:29:35,634
You want to plow your fields
as you see fit,

1248
01:29:35,707 --> 01:29:38,870
and raise your family
according to your own likes?

1249
01:29:38,943 --> 01:29:42,811
And that's your heritage and mine,
every American's.

1250
01:29:43,248 --> 01:29:45,045
But the cost of that heritage is high.

1251
01:29:45,116 --> 01:29:49,018
Sometimes it takes all we have
to preserve it, even our lives.

1252
01:29:50,021 --> 01:29:52,353
How you gonna answer that, York?

1253
01:29:53,758 --> 01:29:54,952
Well...

1254
01:29:55,727 --> 01:29:59,219
You done given me a powerful lot
to be a-thinking about.

1255
01:30:01,266 --> 01:30:03,063
Well, take your time.

1256
01:30:03,568 --> 01:30:08,699
Well, if I could only get home,
back in 'em there hills, I...

1257
01:30:08,773 --> 01:30:11,298
- What would you do?
- Well, I could...

1258
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,840
I could figure something out.

1259
01:30:15,947 --> 01:30:18,347
I've done a heap of thinking
up yonder there once.

1260
01:30:18,416 --> 01:30:20,850
All right, take 10 days' furlough.

1261
01:30:21,352 --> 01:30:22,649
You mean I can go home?

1262
01:30:22,987 --> 01:30:24,887
And when you get back,
if you still can't see it our way,

1263
01:30:24,956 --> 01:30:26,048
I'll recommend your exemption.

1264
01:30:26,124 --> 01:30:28,422
- You will?
- Report to me as soon as you get back.

1265
01:30:28,493 --> 01:30:30,620
I'll arrange your furlough, York,
starting tomorrow.

1266
01:30:30,695 --> 01:30:32,560
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1267
01:30:33,131 --> 01:30:35,395
I sure would like to read this here book.

1268
01:30:35,466 --> 01:30:38,196
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.

1269
01:30:38,269 --> 01:30:41,636
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.

1270
01:30:57,488 --> 01:30:58,955
Come on, boy.

1271
01:31:54,245 --> 01:31:57,703
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma,
or just three?

1272
01:31:58,416 --> 01:32:00,043
Can't say, child.

1273
01:32:01,286 --> 01:32:03,948
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?

1274
01:32:05,123 --> 01:32:09,423
The Book says
man don't live by bread alone.

1275
01:32:10,128 --> 01:32:13,188
Well, what about that there hound dog
he's got with him?

1276
01:32:13,264 --> 01:32:15,095
He can't read the Book.

1277
01:32:16,167 --> 01:32:17,794
Get the table set.

1278
01:32:22,974 --> 01:32:25,909
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.

1279
01:32:26,644 --> 01:32:28,839
Want George to go get him, Ma?

1280
01:32:31,749 --> 01:32:33,148
Let him be.

1281
01:32:50,568 --> 01:32:52,433
<i>Put your trust in the Book, A/vin.</i>

1282
01:32:52,503 --> 01:32:55,097
<i>But here's another book, York.</i>
The History of the United States.

1283

1287

And unto God, God's.

1300
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:13,006
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Have him come in.

1301
01:34:13,084 --> 01:34:15,143
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.

1302
01:34:19,357 --> 01:34:22,918
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.

1303
01:34:22,994 --> 01:34:24,928
Well, you're welcome, York.

1304
01:34:24,996 --> 01:34:27,658
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.

1305
01:34:27,732 --> 01:34:30,599
- Well?
- I'd like to stay in this here army.

1306
01:34:31,235 --> 01:34:33,100
I rather hoped that you would, York.

1307
01:34:33,171 --> 01:34:36,766
But there's just one thing, sir,
that I ought to tell you.

1308
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:38,736
There's lots of things...

1309
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:40,937
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.

1310
01:34:41,012 --> 01:34:43,913
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.

1311
01:34:44,015 --> 01:34:47,644
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.

1312
01:34:47,919 --> 01:34:52,618
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in
something that's a heap bigger than I be.

1313
01:34:55,059 --> 01:34:59,996
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel
called upon to look into your conscience.

1314
01:35:00,832 --> 01:35:03,357
It's enough for me that I trust you.

1315
01:35:03,835 --> 01:35:07,498
And I believe that when the time comes,
you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.

1316
01:35:07,572 --> 01:35:08,834
Thank you, sir.

1317
01:35:08,906 --> 01:35:12,740
And I'm going to approve your promotion
to the rank of corporal.

1318
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:16,610
Well, I'll sure take care of my men
the best I can, sir.

1319
01:35:16,714 --> 01:35:18,545
I know you will, York.

1320
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:21,345
- That's all.
- Thank you, Major.

1321
01:35:24,822 --> 01:35:28,622
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?

1322
01:35:29,126 --> 01:35:31,993
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?

1323
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:35,060
No, I don't think so, Captain.

1324
01:35:35,766 --> 01:35:38,701
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.

1325
01:35:47,078 --> 01:35:48,409
"Dear Mom,

1326
01:35:48,746 --> 01:35:52,978

called Notre Dame Cathedral.

1336
01:36:30,855 --> 01:36:33,881
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.

1337
01:36:34,659 --> 01:36:37,651
It ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.

1338
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:40,895
Alvin's in good hands.

- Yeah.

1341
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,270
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

1342
01:37:21,505 --> 01:37:24,269
You know, you Yanks just got here
in the nick of time.

1343
01:37:24,342 --> 01:37:26,401
We're running shy of these.

1344
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:28,836
Besides, we can do with some help.

1345
01:37:28,913 --> 01:37:30,175
Look out.

1346
01:37:37,855 --> 01:37:41,791
It takes a while, but you'll learn
when to flop and when not to.

1347
01:37:42,026 --> 01:37:44,620
They say you never hear
the one that's hit you.

1348
01:37:44,695 --> 01:37:46,856
That's only half the truth.

1349
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:50,731
No, the whole truth is,
if you hears it, you've got a chance.

1350
01:37:51,702 --> 01:37:52,794
Duck.

1351
01:37:57,274 --> 01:37:58,639
See what I mean?

1352
01:37:58,876 --> 01:38:03,108
- Heinie's got the range good.
- Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.

1353
01:38:03,714 --> 01:38:07,172
- Look out.
- Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.

1354
01:38:09,353 --> 01:38:10,411
See?

1355
01:38:13,524 --> 01:38:16,687
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.

1356
01:38:17,662 --> 01:38:18,822
Duck again.

1357
01:38:28,139 --> 01:38:31,666
If that was shrapnel, now,
we wouldn't be flopping at all.

1358
01:38:31,742 --> 01:38:34,142
You know, you only flop for...

1359
01:38:35,746 --> 01:38:38,374
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.

1360
01:38:38,449 --> 01:38:39,780
Hey, Bert!

1361
01:38:54,832 --> 01:38:58,529
If one's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

1362
01:39:11,682 --> 01:39:15,516
So you see, gentlemen,
the grave responsibility rests upon us.

1363
01:39:16,387 --> 01:39:19,447
This entire German salient,
holding up the Argonne advance

1364
01:39:19,523 --> 01:39:22,583
depends for ammunition and supplies
on the Decauville Railroad,

1365
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:25,356
which as you know,
lies just beyond these hills.

1366
01:39:25,463 --> 01:39:26,760
It must be taken.

1367
01:39:26,831 --> 01:39:28,264
This is all open country ahead,

1368
01:39:28,332 --> 01:39:31,165
but you can expect heavy machinegun fire
from these wooded ridges

1369
01:39:31,235 --> 01:39:35,137
on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.

1370
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,708
Synchronize your watches.

1371
01:39:38,943 --> 01:39:41,878
Use as a mark, 4:32.

1372
01:39:42,947 --> 01:39:46,383
It is now minus 10, eight, six,

1373
01:39:46,884 --> 01:39:49,546
four, two, mark.

1374
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,678
Any questions?

1375
01:39:50,755 --> 01:39:52,882
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?

1376
01:39:52,957 --> 01:39:55,585
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage
at 6:00.

1377
01:39:55,659 --> 01:39:57,786
Zero hour will be 6:10.

1378
01:40:02,867 --> 01:40:06,030
I'd like to know where that barrage is
that we're supposed to have.

1379
01:40:06,103 --> 01:40:10,802
Runners, notify the platoon commanders
that we go over, barrage or no barrage.

1380
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,467
First platoon at 6:10,

1381
01:40:12,543 --> 01:40:15,011
second and third platoons to follow
in waves of 100 meters.

1382
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:16,341
Yes, sir.

1383
01:40:30,194 --> 01:40:32,094
- 6:10.
- 6:10. All right.

1384
01:40:51,882 --> 01:40:53,349
Come on, men!

1385
01:43:08,018 --> 01:43:09,508
Halt and take cover!

1386
01:43:22,433 --> 01:43:23,991
We'll never get through.

1387
01:43:26,136 --> 01:43:27,899
We gotta wipe out those nests.

1388
01:43:27,972 --> 01:43:31,703
Early, take what's left of your section
and work your way back around that hill.

1389
01:43:31,775 --> 01:43:33,402
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.

1390
01:43:33,477 --> 01:43:37,413
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.

1391
01:44:07,945 --> 01:44:09,276
Take cover.

1392
01:44:11,548 --> 01:44:12,708
Listen.

1393
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:35,432
Heinie!

1394
01:44:36,607 --> 01:44:37,733
Listen.

1395
01:44:42,112 --> 01:44:43,477
We're not far enough back.

1396
01:44:43,547 --> 01:44:44,571
Savage, keep the men quiet.

1397
01:44:44,648 --> 01:44:46,707
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.

1398
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:16,342
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.

1399
01:45:17,214 --> 01:45:18,704
Look! Heinies!

1400
01:45:19,483 --> 01:45:21,075
Come on, get 'em.

1401
01:45:41,205 --> 01:45:42,365
Hold your fire!

1402
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:45,931
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!

1403
01:45:46,643 --> 01:45:48,270
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!

1404
01:45:49,646 --> 01:45:51,273
- Get back there.
- Get 'em up there.

1405
01:45:51,348 --> 01:45:52,576
Go on.

1406
01:46:30,988 --> 01:46:33,286
- I'm hit bad, Cutting.
- Me, too.

1407
01:46:34,224 --> 01:46:35,384
Savage.

1408
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:37,418
Savage?

1409
01:46:38,028 --> 01:46:39,325
Where's Savage?

1410
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:42,528
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.

1411
01:46:42,599 --> 01:46:44,760
You're the only noncom left.

1412
01:46:47,104 --> 01:46:49,504
York, take over.

1413
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,736
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.

1414
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:55,872
Watch this fellow.

1415
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,046
The rest of you keep under cover.

1416
01:47:00,918 --> 01:47:02,442
Come back here.

1417
01:47:02,553 --> 01:47:05,579
- Where are you going?
- You done give me command.

1418
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:51,998
Hey, Alvin!

1419
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:02,471
Well, he cleaned out
that machine gun nest.

1420
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:32,170
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys,

1421
01:48:32,242 --> 01:48:34,710
keep your eye on them Heinies
so they don't try any rough stuff.

1422
01:48:34,778 --> 01:48:36,473
Don't try anything funny.

1423
01:48:36,546 --> 01:48:38,514
Belly to the ground, you babies.

1424
01:48:38,582 --> 01:48:39,606
We better get up there.

1425
01:48:39,683 --> 01:48:41,844
No, we better keep an eye
on these prisoners.

1426
01:48:54,031 --> 01:48:57,023
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off
your whole sauerkraut army.

1427
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,568
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.

1428
01:48:59,636 --> 01:49:01,968
- Tell him it's useless.
- What did you say?

1429
01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:03,597
I said tell him it's useless.

1430
01:49:03,674 --> 01:49:06,973
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.

1431
01:49:28,131 --> 01:49:30,326
Just like a flock of turkeys.

1432
01:49:55,125 --> 01:49:58,060
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!

1433
01:49:59,663 --> 01:50:01,153
Come this a-way.

1434
01:50:06,236 --> 01:50:09,569
Tell the rest of them fellows
to quit shooting and come on out of there.

1435
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:17,437
Keep 'em hands up
and start a-going down the hill there.

1436
01:50:20,484 --> 01:50:21,849
Keep a-coming.

1437
01:50:23,854 --> 01:50:26,516
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.

1438
01:50:28,725 --> 01:50:30,693
All right. Keep a-coming.

1439
01:50:31,895 --> 01:50:34,386
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.

1440
01:50:34,498 --> 01:50:36,022
All right, get on down!

1441
01:50:38,502 --> 01:50:40,766
Come on out and keep your hands up.

1442
01:50:40,837 --> 01:50:42,395
Boy, I told you.

1443
01:50:47,878 --> 01:50:48,936
Look at that mob.

1444
01:50:49,012 --> 01:50:50,673
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.

1445
01:50:50,747 --> 01:50:52,374
Sure we can. That's my mate.

1446
01:50:52,449 --> 01:50:54,713
Come on, step lively. Move forward.

1447
01:50:54,785 --> 01:50:56,150
Get going.

1448
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,713
- Move forward.
- Move it, now.

1449
01:51:00,223 --> 01:51:01,451
Move forward, there.

1450
01:51:01,525 --> 01:51:04,050
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.

1451
01:51:08,064 --> 01:51:10,430
- All right.
- Get those hands up. Get in there.

1452
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,695
- Come on.
- Come on, get going.

1453
01:51:12,769 --> 01:51:14,100
Nice going, York.

1454
01:51:14,171 --> 01:51:17,265
- Come on there. Come on.
- Come on, get in there.

1455
01:51:17,541 --> 01:51:20,567
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.

1456
01:51:20,644 --> 01:51:22,703
- Hiya, Pusher.
- That was a good job, pal.

1457
01:51:22,779 --> 01:51:26,044
- Where's the Sergeant?
- Over there. Hurt pretty bad.

1458
01:51:26,683 --> 01:51:29,447
- How many men we got left?
- Eight, besides you.

1459
01:51:32,556 --> 01:51:33,818
Watch them fellows.

1460
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:35,858
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...

1461
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,126
Pusher.

1462
01:51:45,802 --> 01:51:47,030
Pusher.

1463
01:51:47,604 --> 01:51:50,129
This is where we change cars, Alvin.

1464
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:54,138
The end of the line.

1465
01:52:02,152 --> 01:52:04,814
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?

1466
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:13,154
Come on, you, put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

1467
01:52:14,498 --> 01:52:16,125
You know what I'm a-saying?

1468
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:17,791
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1469
01:52:17,868 --> 01:52:20,098
Tell 'em men of yours
if any more of that happens

1470
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:23,401
you and a lot more of 'em's
going to be mighty sorry.

1471
01:52:23,473 --> 01:52:24,701
Go ahead.

1472
01:52:27,377 --> 01:52:29,072
Tell 'em to drop their belts.

1473
01:52:35,685 --> 01:52:37,778
Look them fellows over good.

1474
01:52:41,124 --> 01:52:43,251
- You ready back there?
- Okay here.

1475
01:52:43,326 --> 01:52:45,817
- Okay. Ready here.
- Watch 'em.

1476
01:52:49,733 --> 01:52:51,132
Now, get going.

1477
01:53:07,951 --> 01:53:09,646
Tell 'em to halt.

1478
01:53:12,522 --> 01:53:14,422
If you wanted to get back
to the American lines,

1479
01:53:14,491 --> 01:53:16,789
which way would you be a-going?

1480
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,122
Up there.

1481
01:53:19,062 --> 01:53:21,189
We'll go this a-way. Go on.

1482
01:53:31,841 --> 01:53:33,706
Hey, tell 'em to halt.

1483
01:53:35,845 --> 01:53:36,903
What's up?

1484
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,744
Sounds like them Heinies
is making a heap of trouble.

1485
01:53:41,985 --> 01:53:44,818
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Get 'em.

1486
01:53:45,055 --> 01:53:46,886
We got enough to take care of already.

1487
01:53:46,957 --> 01:53:48,652
And a few more won't make no difference.

1488
01:53:48,725 --> 01:53:49,953
Hey, you.

1489
01:53:50,226 --> 01:53:52,660
Signal up there
and tell 'em they're surrounded.

1490
01:53:52,729 --> 01:53:56,665
Tell 'em to drop their guns
and come down with their hands up.

1491
01:53:58,301 --> 01:54:01,236
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.

1492
01:54:49,386 --> 01:54:51,718
They sure are trained good, Major.

1493
01:54:53,823 --> 01:54:55,552
Hey, Sarge, look.

1494
01:54:56,092 --> 01:54:58,253
- Looks like Heinies.
- Stand ready.

1495
01:55:00,330 --> 01:55:01,820
Hello, there!

1496
01:55:01,998 --> 01:55:04,262
- A Yank.
- It may be some kind of a trick.

1497
01:55:04,334 --> 01:55:06,598
- There's something funny here.
- Let 'em get a little closer.

1498
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:08,604
- Hello there!
- Who are you?

1499
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:12,039
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.

1500
01:55:13,043 --> 01:55:15,068
- Halt where you are.
- Halt!

1501
01:55:16,046 --> 01:55:17,479
That's a Yank, all right.

1502
01:55:17,547 --> 01:55:20,744
- Come out, let's have a look at you.
- Watch 'em, fellows!

1503
01:55:26,723 --> 01:55:28,350
Keep 'em covered.

1504
01:55:31,127 --> 01:55:32,458
Where you going?

1505
01:55:32,529 --> 01:55:35,157
Can you tell me where the 328th be?

1506
01:55:35,231 --> 01:55:36,823
It's up that way someplace.

1507
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:40,358
- Where did you pick up all this bunch?
- Back up the line a ways.

1508
01:55:40,437 --> 01:55:42,667
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands,
could you?

1509
01:55:42,739 --> 01:55:44,536
What would we do with them?

1510
01:55:44,774 --> 01:55:46,537
Well, I don't rightly know.

1511
01:55:46,609 --> 01:55:48,577
- Can we be going?
- Sure. Go ahead.

1512
01:55:48,645 --> 01:55:49,907
Thank you.

1513
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,004
Come on.

1514
01:55:52,082 --> 01:55:53,310
Forward!

1515
01:56:12,802 --> 01:56:14,133
All right. Halt!

1516
01:56:14,204 --> 01:56:16,001
Prisoners, hold right there!

1517
01:56:17,073 --> 01:56:18,904
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.

1518
01:56:26,282 --> 01:56:28,011
Beg your pardon, sir.

1519
01:56:28,284 --> 01:56:29,342
Yeah?

1520
01:56:29,419 --> 01:56:32,820
We all got some prisoners,
can we be a-leaving 'em here?

1521
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:35,481
Put 'em right over there.

1522
01:56:36,993 --> 01:56:38,426
Wait a minute.

1523
01:56:39,429 --> 01:56:40,521
How many have you got?

1524
01:56:40,597 --> 01:56:42,997
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.

1525
01:56:43,066 --> 01:56:46,229
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.

1526
01:56:46,302 --> 01:56:48,395
- Yes, sir, but...
- But what?

1527
01:56:48,571 --> 01:56:52,940
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we
tried to drop 'em off two other places.

1528
01:56:53,009 --> 01:56:55,068
And they ain't but only eight of us
to handle them.

1529
01:56:55,145 --> 01:56:59,445
- You should've brought more men.
- But that's all there were of us, sir.

1530
01:57:00,116 --> 01:57:02,983
You mean to say that you
and seven others captured all that bunch?

1531
01:57:03,052 --> 01:57:06,249
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.

1532
01:57:06,756 --> 01:57:08,747
Well, good Lord.

1533
01:57:09,692 --> 01:57:11,489
I guess we can give you some help.

1534
01:57:11,561 --> 01:57:13,495
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Thank you.

1535
01:57:20,103 --> 01:57:23,539
Hey, Sarge! York by himself
captured 132 Germans.

1536
01:57:23,606 --> 01:57:27,337
Guy named York got 132 Heinies
all by his Ionesome.

1537
01:57:27,410 --> 01:57:29,605
- How did he do it?
- Must have surrounded him.

1538
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,045
- Guy named York.
- That's what they say.

1539
01:57:32,115 --> 01:57:34,913
Gee, he captured
hundreds of Boche and machine guns.

1540
01:57:34,984 --> 01:57:37,953
Guy named York! All by his Ionesome!

1541
01:57:38,021 --> 01:57:39,818
Hey, what's that? How many?

1542
01:57:39,889 --> 01:57:42,084
A whole division and a lot of high officers.

1543
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:44,558
- I'm telling you, York?
- Who's they?

1544
01:57:44,627 --> 01:57:46,618
Yeah, about half the German army
and a general.

1545
01:57:46,696 --> 01:57:48,061
- I don't know.
- One guy.

1546
01:57:48,131 --> 01:57:49,359
How could one guy...

1547
01:57:49,432 --> 01:57:51,662
- Guy named York.
- What's that?

1548
01:57:51,734 --> 01:57:54,066
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.

1549
01:57:54,137 --> 01:57:56,571
And brought them all back. They say...

1550
01:58:02,712 --> 01:58:05,977
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.

1551
01:58:09,419 --> 01:58:12,286
Now, as I understand it, York,
your detail came over that ridge there

1552
01:58:12,355 --> 01:58:14,323
and captured about 30 men,
right down in here.

1553
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:15,414
Yes, sir.

1554
01:58:15,491 --> 01:58:17,322
Then you were forced to cover
by a machine gun

1555
01:58:17,393 --> 01:58:19,554
that was right up on this other ridge.

1556
01:58:19,629 --> 01:58:21,620
Yes, sir. Right up there.

1557
01:58:22,432 --> 01:58:23,558
Where were you?

1558
01:58:23,633 --> 01:58:26,932
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.

1559
01:58:27,503 --> 01:58:31,633
They was machine-gunning us
pretty heavy, so I worked my way across

1560
01:58:32,075 --> 01:58:34,805
up behind that log there under the hill.

1561
01:58:36,512 --> 01:58:38,309
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,

1562
01:58:38,381 --> 01:58:41,282
your being able to cross so much
open ground without being hit?

1563
01:58:41,351 --> 01:58:44,377
I reckon the good Lord
was a-protecting me, sir.

1564
01:58:44,454 --> 01:58:46,479
What did you wanna go over there for?

1565
01:58:46,556 --> 01:58:48,319
Well, I figured that was a good place to be

1566
01:58:48,391 --> 01:58:51,087
because they had to rear up
and show themselves

1567
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,685
in order to shoot at me
and the rest of the boys back here.

1568
01:58:53,763 --> 01:58:55,628
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.

1569
01:58:55,698 --> 01:58:56,722
I see.

1570
01:58:56,799 --> 01:59:00,565
So, I went up the hill,
up around that a-way,

1571
01:59:00,937 --> 01:59:04,634
then worked my way down the ridge
to a place where they was flanked

1572
01:59:04,707 --> 01:59:07,403
and couldn't show themselves
without being hit.

1573
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:10,070
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.

1574
01:59:10,146 --> 01:59:12,011
How many did you kill?

1575
01:59:13,216 --> 01:59:15,116
I don't rightly know, sir.

1576
01:59:15,184 --> 01:59:17,414
I think Captain Danforth
is familiar with that, sir.

1577
01:59:17,487 --> 01:59:20,923
We counted about 20 bodies altogether
up around there.

1578
01:59:21,925 --> 01:59:24,120
What were your men doing
all this time, Corporal?

1579
01:59:24,193 --> 01:59:25,717
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.

1580
01:59:25,795 --> 01:59:28,696
I was pretty busy
and I reckon they was, too.

1581
01:59:28,898 --> 01:59:32,265
According to the statements of the others,
they were guarding the prisoners

1582
01:59:32,335 --> 01:59:35,827
and couldn't expose themselves
to the fire from the ridge.

1583
01:59:35,905 --> 01:59:38,806
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.

1584
01:59:43,579 --> 01:59:44,841
Corporal.

1585
01:59:46,482 --> 01:59:49,781
- There's something that I'd like to know.
- Yes, sir?

1586
01:59:49,986 --> 01:59:52,648
That night that you reported back to me
at Camp Gordon,

1587
01:59:52,722 --> 01:59:55,987
you as much as told me that you were
quite prepared to die for your country,

1588
01:59:56,059 --> 01:59:57,651
but not to kill.

1589
01:59:58,895 --> 02:00:01,659
What made you
decide to change your mind?

1590
02:00:02,065 --> 02:00:03,498
Well, sir...

1591
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,727
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,
why, it's quite all right.

1592
02:00:06,803 --> 02:00:09,499
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever,
sir.

1593
02:00:09,639 --> 02:00:11,573
But it was this way, Colonel.

1594
02:00:11,975 --> 02:00:14,671
When I started out I felt just like you said.

1595
02:00:14,744 --> 02:00:16,837
But when I hear them
machine guns a-going

1596
02:00:16,913 --> 02:00:19,404
and all them fellows
are dropping around me,

1597
02:00:19,515 --> 02:00:23,576
I figured that them guns
was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,

1598
02:00:23,653 --> 02:00:26,850
and there weren't nothing anybody
could do, but to stop them guns.

1599
02:00:26,923 --> 02:00:28,788
And that's what I done.

1600
02:00:29,425 --> 02:00:32,053
You mean to tell me
that you did it to save lives?

1601
02:00:32,128 --> 02:00:34,596
Yes, sir. That was why.

1602
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:42,130
Well, York, what you've just told me
is the most extraordinary thing of all.

1603
02:00:44,507 --> 02:00:45,997
<i>Sergeant</i> York!

1604
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:16,194
Thank you, sir.

1605
02:01:17,373 --> 02:01:20,433
And for conspicuous gallantry
beyond the call of duty,

1606
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:23,911
you have been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross.

1607
02:01:29,185 --> 02:01:32,677
Sergeant York, I am proud that
you are of the All-American Division.

1608
02:01:32,755 --> 02:01:35,622
It's a privilege to command
such men as you.

1609
02:01:39,629 --> 02:01:41,096
Sergeant York,

1610
02:01:41,164 --> 02:01:44,930
as Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces,

1611
02:01:45,001 --> 02:01:47,629
it is my pleasure to confer upon you

1612
02:01:47,703 --> 02:01:50,194
the United States
Congressional Medal of Honor

1613
02:01:50,273 --> 02:01:52,764
for heroism beyond the call of duty.

1614
02:01:55,011 --> 02:01:56,535
Thank you, sir.

1615
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:25,236
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,

1616
02:02:25,308 --> 02:02:27,208
representative from
your district of Tennessee.

1617
02:02:27,276 --> 02:02:29,403
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.

1618
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:31,913
And this is Mr. Harrison
from the Tennessee Society.

1619
02:02:31,981 --> 02:02:33,915
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.

1620
02:02:33,983 --> 02:02:36,008
- Thank you.
- This way, Sergeant.

1621
02:02:47,964 --> 02:02:50,558
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?

1622
02:02:50,633 --> 02:02:53,898
Appears like everybody's
having a mighty good time.

1623
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:56,730
So, Sergeant,
in the name of the people of New York,

1624
02:02:56,806 --> 02:02:59,274
may I present you with this key to our city

1625
02:02:59,342 --> 02:03:01,867
as a token of our very great esteem.

1626
02:03:02,011 --> 02:03:03,876
And may God bless you.

1627
02:03:06,215 --> 02:03:07,477
Thank you for what you said,

1628
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:10,314
and I'm sure grateful to you
for this here key.

1629
02:03:10,386 --> 02:03:12,877
Well, thank you. And thank you all.

1630
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:18,126
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York
would like to show their appreciation.

1631
02:03:18,194 --> 02:03:19,957
Is there anything we can do for you?

1632
02:03:20,029 --> 02:03:22,054
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.

1633
02:03:22,131 --> 02:03:23,257
And that is?

1634
02:03:23,332 --> 02:03:24,856
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,

1635
02:03:24,934 --> 02:03:28,768
I sure would like to ride on the subway
on the Bronx Express.

1636
02:03:29,238 --> 02:03:30,466
I think we can arrange that.

1637
02:03:34,844 --> 02:03:36,471
Well, here we are.

1638
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:43,848
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.

1639
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,785
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please.

1640
02:03:45,855 --> 02:03:48,688
If there's anything you require,
all you will have to do is ask for it.

1641
02:03:48,758 --> 02:03:50,658
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1642
02:03:51,727 --> 02:03:54,719
An awful lot of room
for just one fellow here.

1643
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:13,180
This here is mighty thoughtful of you,
gentlemen.

1644
02:04:13,249 --> 02:04:16,047
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma
for quite a spell.

1645
02:04:16,118 --> 02:04:18,245
So we understand.

1646
02:04:24,427 --> 02:04:26,190
Representative Hull.

1647
02:04:27,296 --> 02:04:29,491
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?

1648
02:04:30,266 --> 02:04:31,665
Put them on.

1649
02:04:31,901 --> 02:04:34,267
- Somebody for you, Sergeant.
- Me?

1650
02:04:37,506 --> 02:04:38,871
Thank you.

1651
02:04:42,144 --> 02:04:44,203
Hello. Hello there.

1652
02:04:47,416 --> 02:04:48,508
What?

1653
02:04:50,386 --> 02:04:51,717
Who is it?

1654
02:04:54,490 --> 02:04:56,355
I... I can't hear you.

1655
02:04:57,393 --> 02:05:00,021
- Who is it?
- What's that you're saying?

1656
02:05:00,363 --> 02:05:01,694
I can't hear you.

1657
02:05:01,764 --> 02:05:03,732
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.

1658
02:05:03,799 --> 02:05:05,232
Stand closer, Ma.

1659
02:05:05,301 --> 02:05:07,633
When are you coming home, Alvin?

1660
02:05:08,304 --> 02:05:12,035
I said, when are you coming home?

1661
02:05:15,278 --> 02:05:16,939
Oh, I'm glad, Son.

1662
02:05:18,681 --> 02:05:20,171
I'll tell her.

1663
02:05:20,583 --> 02:05:22,244
She's right here.

1664
02:05:23,152 --> 02:05:25,518
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.

1665
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:30,015
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!

1666
02:05:30,459 --> 02:05:32,984
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.

1667
02:05:33,062 --> 02:05:35,553
He's got this here phone in here now.

1668
02:05:35,631 --> 02:05:38,464
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.

1669
02:05:38,634 --> 02:05:40,625
I can't wait to see you.

1670
02:05:40,703 --> 02:05:44,002
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie,
right away.

1671
02:05:44,507 --> 02:05:45,599
Yeah.

1672
02:05:46,442 --> 02:05:49,809
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
- Goodbye, Alvin.

1673
02:05:51,347 --> 02:05:52,405
Bye.

1674
02:06:01,023 --> 02:06:03,253
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.

1675
02:06:03,326 --> 02:06:05,726
- I'm a-thanking you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.

1676
02:06:30,786 --> 02:06:33,721
Just like the electric signs
down the street.

1677
02:06:36,592 --> 02:06:40,426
How do you like New York, Alvin,
as much as you've seen of it?

1678
02:06:41,063 --> 02:06:42,928
- Mr. Hull?
- Yes, Alvin?

1679
02:06:44,033 --> 02:06:46,001
I wanna be a-going home.

1680
02:06:46,535 --> 02:06:48,002
When do you think I can go?

1681
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:50,903
- You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
- Yes, sir, I am.

1682
02:06:51,774 --> 02:06:53,332
I've got to get to work.

1683
02:06:53,409 --> 02:06:56,742
Well, as far as that goes,
there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.

1684
02:06:56,812 --> 02:06:57,801
What do you mean?

1685
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:00,280
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

1686
02:07:00,349 --> 02:07:02,340
You're a pretty famous man now.

1687
02:07:02,418 --> 02:07:05,046
And judging by all these offers
you've been getting,

1688
02:07:05,121 --> 02:07:07,351
it seems a lot of people realize it.

1689
02:07:07,423 --> 02:07:08,890
For instance,

1690
02:07:09,358 --> 02:07:12,191
two companies want you
in motion pictures,

1691
02:07:12,261 --> 02:07:14,957
ziegfeld wants you in an act
in his new <i>Fo//ies.</i>

1692
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:18,227
And here's an offer to appear
at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.

1693
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:22,327
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer
who wants you to endorse his product.

1694
02:07:22,405 --> 02:07:24,168
What does that mean?

1695
02:07:24,874 --> 02:07:29,402
Well, you've to tell him how much
you like it, how much good it's done you.

1696
02:07:30,045 --> 02:07:33,071
I ain't never ate
any of that there breakfast food.

1697
02:07:33,149 --> 02:07:34,946
Doesn't seem to make any difference.

1698
02:07:35,017 --> 02:07:37,508
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far

1699
02:07:37,586 --> 02:07:40,555
and they amount to around
a quarter of million dollars.

1700
02:07:40,623 --> 02:07:42,682
They're offering me all that money?

1701
02:07:42,758 --> 02:07:45,454
It's just a plain business proposition.

1702
02:07:46,128 --> 02:07:49,256
I sure could do a powerful sight
with that money.

1703
02:07:49,432 --> 02:07:51,923
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...

1704
02:07:52,001 --> 02:07:54,231
Here's your chance to get it.

1705
02:07:56,038 --> 02:07:59,599
Are they offering that money
because of what happened over there?

1706
02:07:59,675 --> 02:08:02,109
- Well...
- That's it, ain't it?

1707
02:08:03,446 --> 02:08:04,777
That's it.

1708
02:08:06,182 --> 02:08:08,707
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?

1709
02:08:10,386 --> 02:08:12,752
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.

1710
02:08:13,122 --> 02:08:14,646
I reckon it is.

1711
02:08:14,824 --> 02:08:17,759
Take all the time you want to think it over.

1712
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:20,392
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.

1713
02:08:20,463 --> 02:08:23,296
I ain't proud of what happened over there.

1714
02:08:23,432 --> 02:08:26,629
What we done in France
was something we had to do.

1715
02:08:26,735 --> 02:08:29,533
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.

1716
02:08:30,506 --> 02:08:34,670
So, the way I figure,
things like that ain't for buying and selling.

1717
02:08:34,777 --> 02:08:36,438
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.

1718
02:08:36,512 --> 02:08:39,606
Would you be a-telling them that
for me, please?

1719
02:08:39,782 --> 02:08:42,080
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?

1720
02:08:45,421 --> 02:08:48,948
- I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
- Thank you, Mr. Hull.

1721
02:08:55,397 --> 02:08:57,922
Here she comes, zeke. Right on time.

1722
02:09:09,678 --> 02:09:11,270
Oh, there he is!

1723
02:09:27,396 --> 02:09:28,590
Alvin!

1724
02:09:28,664 --> 02:09:30,222
Oh, Alvin!

1725
02:09:30,799 --> 02:09:31,993
How are you?

1726
02:09:53,656 --> 02:09:55,123
Ma, I'm back.

1727
02:09:56,125 --> 02:09:58,355
I'm right glad, Son.

1728
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:03,864
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?

1729
02:10:04,133 --> 02:10:07,227
- What about 'em, George?
- I thought you'd be wearing 'em.

1730
02:10:07,303 --> 02:10:08,531
You'll be a-seeing 'em.

1731
02:10:08,604 --> 02:10:11,038
They better be a-something big.

1732
02:10:11,273 --> 02:10:12,604
As I was saying, Alvin,

1733
02:10:12,675 --> 02:10:16,111
of course, I always figured
on marrying you and Gracie myself,

1734
02:10:16,178 --> 02:10:19,113
but I ain't one to take the job away
from the Governor of the State.

1735
02:10:19,181 --> 02:10:21,843
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero
raised in these parts

1736
02:10:21,917 --> 02:10:23,680
since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.

1737
02:10:23,752 --> 02:10:25,117
Sure are, Alvin.

1738
02:10:25,788 --> 02:10:27,312
Hang on, Rosie.

1739
02:10:29,625 --> 02:10:30,649
Hey,

1740
02:10:31,193 --> 02:10:34,720
what about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?

1741
02:10:34,797 --> 02:10:37,288
- It's still there, I reckon?
- Yep, it's still there.

1742
02:10:37,366 --> 02:10:39,926
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.

1743
02:10:40,002 --> 02:10:44,063
Well, I couldn't rightly expect zeb
to hold it for me all this time.

1744
02:10:44,139 --> 02:10:46,505
I sure would like to see that there
piece of land, though.

1745
02:10:46,575 --> 02:10:48,805
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.

1746
02:10:48,877 --> 02:10:50,970
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.

1747
02:10:51,547 --> 02:10:55,005
I'll let you off at the fork and
you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.

1748
02:10:56,418 --> 02:10:58,079
Hang on, everyone.

1749
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:03,214
Hey, look here.

1750
02:11:05,027 --> 02:11:08,758
- Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
- Yeah, they have.

1751
02:11:09,598 --> 02:11:12,032
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.

1752
02:11:12,601 --> 02:11:14,466
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.

1753
02:11:14,536 --> 02:11:17,198
There's something we got to talk about.

1754
02:11:17,339 --> 02:11:20,502
- Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
- What about, Alvin?

1755
02:11:20,576 --> 02:11:22,441
Well, what with the governor fixing
to marry us

1756
02:11:22,511 --> 02:11:24,206
and all them people coming here
from all over...

1757
02:11:24,279 --> 02:11:27,737
Sure takes a body's breath away,
but I reckon we'll get through it all right.

1758
02:11:27,816 --> 02:11:31,183
- Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
- Well, what then?

1759
02:11:31,253 --> 02:11:35,451
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing
to offer you excepting a big wedding.

1760
02:11:35,524 --> 02:11:37,788
Why, some girls don't even get that.

1761
02:11:38,293 --> 02:11:41,387
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep,
wouldn't you?

1762
02:11:41,463 --> 02:11:42,930
Oh, I don't know.

1763
02:11:42,998 --> 02:11:45,262
I done a heap of sleeping
while you was away.

1764
02:11:45,334 --> 02:11:48,394
You sure ain't expecting
too much of a husband.

1765
02:11:48,637 --> 02:11:50,730
I'm expecting my husband to love me.

1766
02:11:50,806 --> 02:11:53,331
I reckon the good Lord
will take care of the rest.

1767
02:11:53,409 --> 02:11:55,900
Well, looks like he's done a heap already,

1768
02:11:55,978 --> 02:11:57,969
just a-having you. But...

1769
02:11:58,213 --> 02:12:01,842
Well, I was expecting to take over
from here myself.

1770
02:12:01,917 --> 02:12:04,511
I reckon you'll get to do your share.

1771
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:07,884
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.

1772
02:12:08,424 --> 02:12:09,413
We got to wait.

1773
02:12:09,491 --> 02:12:12,790
Maybe in another two or three years,
if you're willing to wait...

1774
02:12:12,861 --> 02:12:14,726
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.

1775
02:12:14,797 --> 02:12:18,426
- You mean you won't wait?
- There ain't no need of waiting.

1776
02:12:18,867 --> 02:12:22,496
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down
and don't you be looking up till I tell you.

1777
02:12:23,505 --> 02:12:24,733
Come on.

1778
02:12:30,713 --> 02:12:32,704
There! Now you can look.

1779
02:12:33,348 --> 02:12:35,680
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.

1780
02:12:35,951 --> 02:12:38,920
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.

1781
02:12:38,987 --> 02:12:41,820
The people of the state of Tennessee
for what you done.

1782
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:43,824
- You mean...
- Only, it's 200 acres

1783
02:12:43,892 --> 02:12:47,953
and the house is bigger, with more
windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.

1784
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:50,222
And it's for us.

1785
02:12:55,804 --> 02:12:58,637
The Lord sure does move
in mysterious ways.

1786
02:12:59,975 --> 02:13:01,203
Come on.

1787
02:14:01,937 --> 02:14:02,926
English
