1
00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:02,418
Bye, Alvin.

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,954
l'll be a-coming back.

3
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:13,088
Ma.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,593
What are they a-fighting for?

5
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:19,363
l don't rightly know, child.

6
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:23,600
l don't rightly know.

7
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,544
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.

8
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:38,017
Okay, Sarge.

9
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:44,524
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon
you got there, it's a shovel.

10
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:46,753
-Lay into it.
-Okay, General.

11
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:48,362
Dig, soldiers, dig.

12
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:50,188
Dig your way straight down to China.

13
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,994
-Okay, Sarge.
-China?

14
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,497
What's the idea of going to China?
l thought this war was in Europe.

15
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,476
Parsons, Sergeant Early.

16
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:04,940
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:07,147
Which one of your men is York?

18
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,740
He is the big, lanky fellow,
fourth from the end, sir.

19
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:12,412
-Having any trouble with him?
-No, sir. Why?

20
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:15,484
He's down here
as a conscientious objector.

21
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,752
Keep your eye on him.
l want a weekly report.

22
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,088
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,664
That'll be a big help.

24
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,825
Dig. Dig. Dig.

25
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:34,608
l've been working in a subway all my life,
never thought about the guys that dug it.

26
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,907
But since l'm in the army,
l sure take my hat off to them.

27
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,879
-Subway you say?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,879
What's this here subway
you're talking about?

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,612
You mean to say you don't know
what a subway is? That guy kidding?

30
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,779
No, they don't have subways
where he comes from, l guess.

31
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,415
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?

32
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,517
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.

33
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,685
-Where is that?
-Tennessee.

34
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,658
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?

35
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,996
-Ain't never even heard of one.
-You never... What? Heard?

36
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,968
Heard? What kind of talk is that?

37
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:04,334
Do they all talk that kind of English
where you come from?

38
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:08,467
Well, there ain't any English people
down our way, just Americans.

39
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,840
Well, look, a subway is a big hole
in the ground, see?

40
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,607
lt goes for miles.

41
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,013
-Straight down?
-Yeah... No.

42
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,452
lt doesn't go straight down,
it goes this way.

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,112
-Oh, this a-way?
-Yeah.

44
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,382
-Under the ground?
-Under the ground.

45
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:25,221
-And trains run through it.
-They run through it?

46
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,193
-Yeah.
-Steam cars?

47
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,594
Steam... No. Steam cars.

48
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:32,599
-They're electric, Alvin.
-l sure would like to see one of 'em.

49
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,999
You see, they have to run trains
under the ground in New York,

50
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,333
-because it's so crowded.
-Crowded? l'll say.

51
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,896
Look, it's the rush hour,
the Bronx Express is just pulling in.

52
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:41,965
l'm standing on the platform,
holding back the mob.

53
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,876
The doors open up and l...
You know what l'm talking about?

54
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,709
Just a word now and then.

55
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,909
Well, you see, the people are just coming
from work and they wanna get home, see,

56
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,542
and they wanna get into the cars
all together.

57
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,348
They start pushing,
l'm trying to hold 'em back.

58
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,187
Well, anyway, the doors open up and
now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.

59
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,782
''Move back in the cars,'' l yell.

60
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,761
Ain't no room in there, but l yell,
''Move back in the cars.''

61
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,231
Boy, how l used to push 'em in. l used
to pack them in like sardines in a can.

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,528
That's why they call me ''Pusher.''

63
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,466
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.

64
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,504
-Get a move on.
-Yes, sir.

65
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:14,304
This is the one bugle call
l ain't got no arguments with.

66
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:17,444
-2-4-1-8-0-0.
-Zaranopolis Nick.

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,581
2-4-1-8-0-1 .

68
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,413
-2-4-1-8-0-1 .
-Ross, Michael T.

69
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,579
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?

70
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:29,418
-Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
-Sure.

71
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:34,224
-2-1-8-1-0-2.
-2-1-8-1-0-2.

72
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,520
York, Alvin C.

73
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,832
Anything wrong with it?

74
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,695
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.

75
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:46,934
l thought maybe you might have
some conscientious objections to it.

76
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,768
No, sir, l ain't.

77
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:52,438
Careful you don't kill anybody with it
till we get to France.

78
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,539
-Next man.
-There you are, York.

79
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:59,144
-2-1-4-8-0-3.
-2-1-4-8-0-3.

80
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,744
Thomas, Bert E.

81
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,022
Boy, look at that shine,
is that clean or is that clean?

82
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,192
Look, Sarge, you can eat
right off the trigger.

83
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,428
Not bad.

84
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:18,766
You call that clean?

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,274
-What's the matter with it?
-Look.

86
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,706
-l don't see nothing.
-lt's full of grease.

87
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,440
Won't that make the bullet
come out faster?

88
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:27,742
Clean it.

89
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,718
That's a good job, York.

90
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,887
Did you ever clean a rifle before?

91
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:36,617
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
l done clean my own, though.

92
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,352
So you've got a gun of your own,
have you?

93
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:41,361
-Yes, sir.
-l wouldn't think you'd have one.

94
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,836
Well, the next time get your sling
a little higher on your arm.

95
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,035
Okay.

96
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,906
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.

97
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,643
Now, remember, you guys,
you're using real, live ammunition.

98
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:06,710
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
lt'll hit whatever you aim it at.

99
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,879
So don't start murdering each other.

100
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,687
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.

101
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,386
Ready, number 30.

102
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,723
Not yet, we'll try it first.

103
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,067
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.

104
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,602
Take a deep breath.

105
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,002
Blow, let a little of it out.

106
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:26,935
Hold it.

107
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,408
Remember, keep your sights
on the center of the bull's-eye.

108
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:31,445
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.

109
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:34,948
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.

110
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,484
Ready? Aim.

111
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,512
l can't hold it no more.

112
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,989
All right, Ross, take another one.

113
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,551
Aim.

114
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:47,986
Fire.

115
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:51,031
Look, Ross, you had your thumb
sticking straight up in the air.

116
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,259
Just like that.

117
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,732
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.

118
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,099
Oh, it does? lt gives you balance, does it?

119
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,535
-Yeah.
-Here.

120
00:05:58,573 --> 00:05:59,631
Load.

121
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:02,667
Aim.

122
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,979
-Fire.
-Oh, my eye.

123
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:09,507
Maybe that will teach you
to keep your thumb down.

124
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:12,951
That's something
for the rest of you men to remember.

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,684
-A miss.
-Miss.

126
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,890
Ready on number 29.

127
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:24,863
Ready on 29.

128
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,263
Ready, 29.

129
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:31,370
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.

130
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,463
Aim. Fire.

131
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:38,137
l ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.

132
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,737
All right, next time get that sling
a little higher on your arm.

133
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,305
Press your cheek
a little closer to the stock.

134
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,407
Yes, sir.

135
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:46,385
Make sure that front sight
divides the rear sight in half.

136
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:48,615
l reckon l know about that, Sergeant.

137
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,783
You reckon you know about that, do you?

138
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,485
We'll see. Here.

139
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,729
Load. Aim.

140
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:02,460
Fire.

141
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,903
-A miss!
-Miss.

142
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,235
So you know about sighting, do you?

143
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,881
l sure thought l cut plumb center
that time.

144
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,382
You did, huh?

145
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:20,114
l can't no ways see how l can miss
that whole great big target.

146
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,782
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.

147
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,015
Re-mark for 29.

148
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,822
Re-mark, 29.

149
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,320
Oh, l didn't see that one.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,992
-A bull's-eye, 4:00.
-Bull's-eye.

151
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,737
l can't figure out how l got
way down there on the edge.

152
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:43,174
Well, l reckon l can do a little better
when l get used to this here rifle gun.

153
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,644
Here's five chances to do better.

154
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,510
Fire when ready.

155
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,849
Hey, what are you wetting
that front sight for?

156
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:00,656
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.

157
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:04,391
l always wet my sights
when l'm fixing to do some shooting.

158
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,991
Okay, do some shooting.

159
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,938
-Bull's-eye, dead center.
-Bull's-eye.

160
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:21,310
Okay, York. You're on your own.

161
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:30,146
-Bull's-eye.
-Bull's-eye.

162
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,793
-Bull's-eye.
-Bull's-eye.

163
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,195
-Bull's-eye.
-Bull's-eye.

164
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,836
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.

165
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:53,904
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.

166
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,006
Let's see that target, Sergeant.

167
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,111
Bring 29 to the firing line.

168
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,720
There's the first shot,
and here's the other five here.

169
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,696
l reckon that there gun
shoots a might to the right.

170
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,256
Where did you learn to shoot, York?

171
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,063
Well, l ain't never learnt, Sergeant.

172
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:19,868
Folks back home used to say
l could shoot a rifle before l was weaned.

173
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,273
But they was exaggerating some.

174
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:28,438
Now, supposing these here cartridges
is a flock of wild turkeys,

175
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:31,507
a-flying across the ridge
coming this a-way, see, right at me.

176
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,212
Now, which one of them
would you shoot first?

177
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,585
l'd take a crack at all of 'em
and trust to luck.

178
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,624
Well, you wouldn't have no luck
that way, Pusher.

179
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:40,524
No? Well, then l'd pick the motorman.

180
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:44,154
-The what?
-The motorman. The guy out in front.

181
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,429
Well, that ain't right either,
if you wanna get more than one turkey.

182
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,230
Now, which one of them's
got the most meat on him?

183
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,895
Yeah, what's the answer?

184
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,201
Well, now, if you shoot this one here,
the leader,

185
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:55,572
the rest of 'em will see him drop
and fly off, see?

186
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:58,840
So, you draw down
on the last turkey here,

187
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,606
and then the next one, see?

188
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:04,316
Kind of coming from back to front.

189
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:07,243
Then the rest of 'em won't know
they're being hit.

190
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,413
And, if...

191
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:11,390
Of course, they might flare off some
when the shooting starts,

192
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,756
but if a fellow's got himself
a repeating rifle,

193
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,818
he's got a good chance
of getting the whole flock.

194
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:18,558
-Sounds all right.
-Turkeys sure is dumb animals.

195
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,567
Seems you picked up a good bit
down in the hills, Alvin.

196
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:24,103
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting
knows that.

197
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,368
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.

198
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,103
-Yes, sir.
-What have you been up to now?

199
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:33,442
l don't know.
l've been aiming not to make no trouble.

200
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,572
lt's your move.

201
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,882
-Private York reporting, sir.
-Yes, York. At ease.

202
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:46,058
York, Captain Danforth has just
handed me a report concerning you,

203
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,026
made by your company sergeant.

204
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,357
Yes, sir?

205
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,090
You have a very excellent camp record.

206
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,368
Well, l'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.

207
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:59,099
You applied for exemption, l believe,
as a conscientious objector.

208
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:00,435
Yes, sir.

209
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,166
Well, l think we can disregard that.

210
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,242
York, Sergeant Parsons
recommends your promotion

211
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:09,373
to the rank of corporal with special detail

212
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,078
as instructor in target practice.

213
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,121
Captain Danforth and l heartily approve.

214
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:17,157
l congratulate you, York.

215
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:22,318
Well, l'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.

216
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:26,291
Well, l'll learn 'em fellows to shoot
the best l can,

217
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,699
like l already done Pusher and Bert.

218
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:33,365
l mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir,
but,

219
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,508
well, l don't want to be no corporal.

220
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:40,672
-What's that?
-l said l don't want to be no corporal.

221
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:43,908
-Why not?
-Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.

222
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:45,745
Well, you see, l...

223
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:48,549
ls it because of your
religious convictions, York?

224
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,351
Yes, sir. That's it.

225
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:53,190
You see, l believe in the Bible,

226
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,124
and l'm a-believing
that this here life we're living

227
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,632
is something the Lord done give us.

228
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,499
And we got to be a-living it
the best we can.

229
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,563
And l'm figuring that a-killing other folks

230
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:11,975
ain't no part of what he was intending
for us to be a-doing here.

231
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,012
Well, yes. ln a way l agree with you.

232
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,051
York, with your permission, Major?

233
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,609
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.

234
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,951
You... You say you believe in the Bible?

235
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,620
Yes, sir.

236
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,351
Well, l do, too.

237
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,992
But do you believe that the Bible means
that a man shouldn't fight

238
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,430
for what he believes to be right?

239
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:35,463
Well, it done said,

240
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,968
''Blessed are the peacemakers.''

241
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,733
Yes, l know, but...

242
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:43,766
You remember that verse,
l think it's in Luke,

243
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:48,877
where he says, ''He that hath no sword,
let him sell his garment, and buy one''?

244
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,780
He said that to Peter.

245
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:53,276
But he doesn't stop Peter
from using his sword.

246
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:57,483
He said, ''Them that lives by the sword
will be a-perishing by the sword.''

247
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,185
That were further on.

248
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:02,523
-Yes, l remember, but...
-No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.

249
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,787
But according to St. John,

250
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:08,364
he said, ''My kingdom is not of this world.

251
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,068
''lf my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servant fight.''

252
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,970
Well, that's just the point, Captain.

253
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,135
He done said
his kingdom were not of this world.

254
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:19,537
And that... That is different.

255
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:22,138
-Yes, but...
-Just a moment, Captain.

256
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,011
York, have you ever read this?

257
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:27,650
''History of the United States. ''

258
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:32,951
lt sure is a lot of writing.

259
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,694
-Daniel Boone?
-Yeah.

260
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:41,765
You know about him?

261
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,235
Well, everybody down our way
knows about Daniel Boone.

262
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,465
First man into
the Valley of the Three Forks.

263
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,737
Yes, he was quite a man,
one of the greatest.

264
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:53,346
And that book's full of great men.

265
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:59,147
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for

266
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,517
when he went out alone
into the wilderness?

267
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,988
Well, l never thought much on it.

268
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,586
Was he looking for new lands?

269
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,490
-Might be.
-Maybe.

270
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,397
Maybe for something more.

271
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:16,431
Something that a man just can't see
with his eyes or hold in his hands.

272
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:21,140
Something that some men don't even
know they have until they've lost it.

273
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,540
-Yes, sir.
-To be free.

274
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,578
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.

275
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,509
l think that's what he wanted.

276
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,315
l think that's what sent Boone
into your Tennessee country.

277
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,089
ls that what...
That what this here book's about?

278
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,283
Yep.

279
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:42,487
That's the story of a whole people's
struggle for freedom

280
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,031
from the very beginning until now.

281
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:47,191
For we're still struggling.

282
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:49,893
lt's quite a story, York.

283
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:53,634
How they all got together
and set up a government,

284
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:58,504
whereby all men were pledged
to defend the rights of each man,

285
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,548
and each man
to defend the rights of all men.

286
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:05,616
We call it a government of the people,

287
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:09,286
by the people and for the people.

288
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:14,392
Why, l never knowed
it was all written down.

289
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:17,492
-You're a religious man, York.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,960
You want to worship God
in your own way.

291
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,194
Yes, sir.

292
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,362
-You're a farmer?
-Yes, sir.

293
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,701
You want to plow your fields
as you see fit,

294
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:29,936
and raise your family
according to your own likes?

295
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,878
And that's your heritage and mine,
every American's.

296
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,111
But the cost of that heritage is high.

297
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:40,085
Sometimes it takes all we have
to preserve it, even our lives.

298
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,420
How you gonna answer that, York?

299
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,019
Well...

300
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,285
You done given me a powerful lot
to be a-thinking about.

301
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,129
Well, take your time.

302
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:59,766
Well, if l could only get home,
back in 'em there hills, l...

303
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,365
-What would you do?
-Well, l could...

304
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,907
l could figure something out.

305
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,414
l've done a heap of thinking
up yonder there once.

306
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,917
All right, take 10 days' furlough.

307
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:13,716
You mean l can go home?

308
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,954
And when you get back,
if you still can't see it our way,

309
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,115
l'll recommend your exemption.

310
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,488
-You will?
-Report to me as soon as you get back.

311
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,686
l'll arrange your furlough, York,
starting tomorrow.

312
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,627
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

313
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,461
l sure would like to read this here book.

314
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,263
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.

315
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,703
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.

316
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,022
Come on, boy.

317
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:48,770
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma,
or just three?

318
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,110
Can't say, child.

319
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:55,014
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?

320
00:17:56,189 --> 00:18:00,489
The Book says
man don't live by bread alone.

321
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:04,254
Well, what about that there hound dog
he's got with him?

322
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:06,162
He can't read the Book.

323
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:08,861
Get the table set.

324
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,975
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.

325
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,906
Want George to go get him, Ma?

326
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,215
Let him be.

327
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,500
Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.

328
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,164
But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.

329
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,833
Them that lived by the sword,
will be a-perishing by the sword.

330
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,377
The government of all men
to defend the rights of each man.

331
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,469
And each man
to defend the rights of all men.

332
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,277
Remember, the Lord done said,
''Thou shalt not kill. ''

333
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,374
But the cost of that heritage is high.

334
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,749
Sometimes all we have to preserve it,
even our lives.

335
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:03,312
-Obey your God.
-Defend your country.

336
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,187
-Your God.
-Your country.

337
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,589
-Your God.
-Your country.

338
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,649
-God.
-Country.

339
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:08,751
-God.
-Country.

340
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:10,194
-God.
-Country...

341
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:24,903
''Render therefore unto Caesar

342
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,610
''the things which were Caesar's,

343
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:32,948
''and unto God
the things that were God's.''

344
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:38,420
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.

345
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:44,459
And unto God, God's.

346
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,073
-Private York reporting, sir.
-Have him come in.

347
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,209
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.

348
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:13,984
l'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And l'm a-thanking you.

349
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,994
Well, you're welcome, York.

350
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,724
l done what you told me,
l thought things over.

351
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,665
-Well?
-l'd like to stay in this here army.

352
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:24,167
l rather hoped that you would, York.

353
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:27,832
But there's just one thing, sir,
that l ought to tell you.

354
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:29,802
There's lots of things...

355
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,003
There's lots of things
l ain't figured out yet.

356
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,979
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.

357
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:38,710
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.

358
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:43,684
l reckon l can just be a-trusting in
something that's a heap bigger than l be.

359
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:51,063
York, as your superior officer, l don't feel
called upon to look into your conscience.

360
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,423
lt's enough for me that l trust you.

361
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:58,564
And l believe that when the time comes,
you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.

362
00:20:58,638 --> 00:20:59,900
Thank you, sir.

363
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:03,807
And l'm going to approve your promotion
to the rank of corporal.

364
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:07,677
Well, l'll sure take care of my men
the best l can, sir.

365
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,612
l know you will, York.

366
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:12,411
-That's all.
-Thank you, Major.

367
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:19,689
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?

368
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:23,060
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?

369
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:26,127
No, l don't think so, Captain.

370
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,768
l don't think l'm taking any chances at all.

371
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:39,475
''Dear Mom,

372
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:44,045
''am feeling just fine
and have taken in all the sights.

373
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:48,611
''And Bert took me to a church
called Notre Dame Cathedral.

374
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:54,016
''lt's big enough inside for a fellow
to plant a crop of corn.

375
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,092
''Pusher just come in.

376
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:02,260
''He's saying our outfit is moving up
to front pretty soon.

377
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:07,169
''l reckon that's so
'cause we got all our training

378
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,108
''and they ain't brought us here
for no sight-seeing tour...''

379
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,168
''Tour, nohow.

380
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:17,848
''Gracie wrote in her letter
she was a-worrying.

381
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,346
''Tell her, don't.''

382
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:24,947
l was feared. l'm a-feared for Alvin.

383
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:28,717
lt ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.

384
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,961
Alvin's in good hands.

385
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:36,824
The Lord takes care of 'em
that's a-believing in Him.

386
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,131
-Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
-Yeah.

387
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:12,337
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

388
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:15,336
You know, you Yanks just got here
in the nick of time.

389
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:17,467
We're running shy of these.

390
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:19,902
Besides, we can do with some help.

391
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,241
Look out.

392
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:32,858
lt takes a while, but you'll learn
when to flop and when not to.

393
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,687
They say you never hear
the one that's hit you.

394
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,923
That's only half the truth.

395
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:41,797
No, the whole truth is,
if you hears it, you've got a chance.

396
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:43,861
Duck.

397
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:49,706
See what l mean?

398
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:54,175
-Heinie's got the range good.
-Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.

399
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:58,239
-Look out.
-Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.

400
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,478
See?

401
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:07,754
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.

402
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:09,888
Duck again.

403
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:22,732
lf that was shrapnel, now,
we wouldn't be flopping at all.

404
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,209
You know, you only flop for...

405
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:29,441
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.

406
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:30,847
Hey, Bert!

407
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,596
lf one's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

408
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:06,583
So you see, gentlemen,
the grave responsibility rests upon us.

409
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:10,513
This entire German salient,
holding up the Argonne advance

410
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,650
depends for ammunition and supplies
on the Decauville Railroad,

411
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:16,422
which as you know,
lies just beyond these hills.

412
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,826
lt must be taken.

413
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:19,330
This is all open country ahead,

414
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,232
but you can expect heavy machinegun fire
from these wooded ridges

415
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:26,204
on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.

416
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,774
Synchronize your watches.

417
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,944
Use as a mark, 4:32.

418
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,449
lt is now minus 10, eight, six,

419
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:40,613
four, two, mark.

420
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:41,745
Any questions?

421
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,948
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?

422
00:25:44,023 --> 00:25:46,651
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage
at 6:00.

423
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,853
Zero hour will be 6:10.

424
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:57,096
l'd like to know where that barrage is
that we're supposed to have.

425
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,869
Runners, notify the platoon commanders
that we go over, barrage or no barrage.

426
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,533
First platoon at 6:10,

427
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,078
second and third platoons to follow
in waves of 100 meters.

428
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:07,407
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,161
-6:10.
-6:10. All right.

430
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,416
Come on, men!

431
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,575
Halt and take cover!

432
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,057
We'll never get through.

433
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:18,966
We gotta wipe out those nests.

434
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,769
Early, take what's left of your section
and work your way back around that hill.

435
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,469
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.

436
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:28,480
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.

437
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:00,342
Take cover.

438
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:03,775
Listen.

439
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:26,498
Heinie!

440
00:30:27,673 --> 00:30:28,799
Listen.

441
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,544
We're not far enough back.

442
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:35,638
Savage, keep the men quiet.

443
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:37,774
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.

444
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,409
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.

445
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:09,771
Look! Heinies!

446
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,142
Come on, get 'em.

447
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:33,431
Hold your fire!

448
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:36,998
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!

449
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,337
Line 'em up and disarm 'em !

450
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:42,340
-Get back there.
-Get 'em up there.

451
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:43,643
Go on.

452
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:24,352
-l'm hit bad, Cutting.
-Me, too.

453
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,451
Savage.

454
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:28,484
Savage?

455
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,392
Where's Savage?

456
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:33,594
l seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.

457
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,827
You're the only noncom left.

458
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,570
York, take over.

459
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:43,803
-Did you hear what l said?
-l heard you.

460
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,938
Watch this fellow.

461
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:50,113
The rest of you keep under cover.

462
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,508
Come back here.

463
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,645
-Where are you going?
-You done give me command.

464
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,064
Hey, Alvin!

465
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:53,538
Well, he cleaned out
that machine gun nest.

466
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:23,236
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys,

467
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:25,777
keep your eye on them Heinies
so they don't try any rough stuff.

468
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,540
Don't try anything funny.

469
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:29,581
Belly to the ground, you babies.

470
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:30,672
We better get up there.

471
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,911
No, we better keep an eye
on these prisoners.

472
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:48,089
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off
your whole sauerkraut army.

473
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,635
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.

474
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:53,035
-Tell him it's useless.
-What did you say?

475
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:54,663
l said tell him it's useless.

476
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,039
You tell him.
You talk better English than l do.

477
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,393
Just like a flock of turkeys.

478
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:49,127
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!

479
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:52,219
Come this a-way.

480
00:35:57,303 --> 00:36:00,636
Tell the rest of them fellows
to quit shooting and come on out of there.

481
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:08,504
Keep 'em hands up
and start a-going down the hill there.

482
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,915
Keep a-coming.

483
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,582
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.

484
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,760
All right. Keep a-coming.

485
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:25,453
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.

486
00:36:25,564 --> 00:36:27,088
All right, get on down!

487
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,832
Come on out and keep your hands up.

488
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,462
Boy, l told you.

489
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:40,002
Look at that mob.

490
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,740
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.

491
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:43,441
Sure we can. That's my mate.

492
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,779
Come on, step lively. Move forward.

493
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:47,216
Get going.

494
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:49,779
-Move forward.
-Move it, now.

495
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,518
Move forward, there.

496
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:55,116
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.

497
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:01,497
-All right.
-Get those hands up. Get in there.

498
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,762
-Come on.
-Come on, get going.

499
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,167
Nice going, York.

500
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:08,331
-Come on there. Come on.
-Come on, get in there.

501
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:11,633
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.

502
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,769
-Hiya, Pusher.
-That was a good job, pal.

503
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:17,111
-Where's the Sergeant?
-Over there. Hurt pretty bad.

504
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,514
-How many men we got left?
-Eight, besides you.

505
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:24,884
Watch them fellows.

506
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,925
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...

507
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,193
Pusher.

508
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,097
Pusher.

509
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,196
This is where we change cars, Alvin.

510
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:45,205
The end of the line.

511
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:55,880
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?

512
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:04,220
Come on, you, put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

513
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:07,191
You know what l'm a-saying?

514
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,858
-You understand?
-Yeah.

515
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:11,164
Tell 'em men of yours
if any more of that happens

516
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:14,467
you and a lot more of 'em's
going to be mighty sorry.

517
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,768
Go ahead.

518
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:20,139
Tell 'em to drop their belts.

519
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,845
Look them fellows over good.

520
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:34,318
-You ready back there?
-Okay here.

521
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,884
-Okay. Ready here.
-Watch 'em.

522
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,198
Now, get going.

523
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:00,713
Tell 'em to halt.

524
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:05,489
lf you wanted to get back
to the American lines,

525
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:07,855
which way would you be a-going?

526
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,188
Up there.

527
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:12,256
We'll go this a-way. Go on.

528
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:24,773
Hey, tell 'em to halt.

529
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:27,970
What's up?

530
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,811
Sounds like them Heinies
is making a heap of trouble.

531
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:35,885
-What are we gonna do about it?
-Get 'em.

532
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:37,952
We got enough to take care of already.

533
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,718
And a few more won't make no difference.

534
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,020
Hey, you.

535
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,727
Signal up there
and tell 'em they're surrounded.

536
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:47,732
Tell 'em to drop their guns
and come down with their hands up.

537
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:52,303
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.

538
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:42,784
They sure are trained good, Major.

539
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,619
Hey, Sarge, look.

540
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,320
-Looks like Heinies.
-Stand ready.

541
00:40:51,396 --> 00:40:52,886
Hello, there!

542
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:55,329
-A Yank.
-lt may be some kind of a trick.

543
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,664
-There's something funny here.
-Let 'em get a little closer.

544
00:40:57,736 --> 00:40:59,670
-Hello there!
-Who are you?

545
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:03,105
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.

546
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:06,134
-Halt where you are.
-Halt!

547
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,545
That's a Yank, all right.

548
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:11,811
-Come out, let's have a look at you.
-Watch 'em, fellows!

549
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:19,416
Keep 'em covered.

550
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,525
Where you going?

551
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:26,223
Can you tell me where the 328th be?

552
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:27,890
lt's up that way someplace.

553
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:31,424
-Where did you pick up all this bunch?
-Back up the line a ways.

554
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,733
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands,
could you?

555
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,602
What would we do with them?

556
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,604
Well, l don't rightly know.

557
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:39,644
-Can we be going?
-Sure. Go ahead.

558
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:40,973
Thank you.

559
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,071
Come on.

560
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:44,376
Forward!

561
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,200
All right. Halt!

562
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,067
Prisoners, hold right there!

563
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,971
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.

564
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,078
Beg your pardon, sir.

565
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:20,409
Yeah?

566
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:23,886
We all got some prisoners,
can we be a-leaving 'em here?

567
00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:26,547
Put 'em right over there.

568
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,493
Wait a minute.

569
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:31,587
How many have you got?

570
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:34,063
Well, l done counted 132 heads, sir.

571
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:37,295
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.

572
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:39,462
-Yes, sir, but...
-But what?

573
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:44,007
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we
tried to drop 'em off two other places.

574
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,135
And they ain't but only eight of us
to handle them.

575
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:50,511
-You should've brought more men.
-But that's all there were of us, sir.

576
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:54,050
You mean to say that you
and seven others captured all that bunch?

577
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,316
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.

578
00:42:57,823 --> 00:42:59,814
Well, good Lord.

579
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:02,556
l guess we can give you some help.

580
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,562
-Come on, Sergeant.
-Thank you.

581
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:14,605
Hey, Sarge! York by himself
captured 132 Germans.

582
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:18,404
Guy named York got 132 Heinies
all by his lonesome.

583
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:20,672
-How did he do it?
-Must have surrounded him.

584
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:23,112
-Guy named York.
-That's what they say.

585
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:25,979
Gee, he captured
hundreds of Boche and machine guns.

586
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:29,020
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!

587
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:30,884
Hey, what's that? How many?

588
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:33,151
A whole division and a lot of high officers.

589
00:43:33,225 --> 00:43:35,625
-l'm telling you, York?
-Who's they?

590
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:37,685
Yeah, about half the German army
and a general.

591
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:39,128
-l don't know.
-One guy.

592
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:40,425
How could one guy...

593
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:42,729
-Guy named York.
-What's that?

594
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:45,133
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.

595
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:47,637
And brought them all back. They say...

596
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:57,044
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.

597
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:03,352
Now, as l understand it, York,
your detail came over that ridge there

598
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:05,390
and captured about 30 men,
right down in here.

599
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:06,481
Yes, sir.

600
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:08,389
Then you were forced to cover
by a machine gun

601
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,621
that was right up on this other ridge.

602
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:12,687
Yes, sir. Right up there.

603
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:14,624
Where were you?

604
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,999
Well, l was...
l was a-laying behind that log there.

605
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,700
They was machine-gunning us
pretty heavy, so l worked my way across

606
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:25,871
up behind that log there under the hill.

607
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,376
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,

608
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:32,349
your being able to cross so much
open ground without being hit?

609
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:35,443
l reckon the good Lord
was a-protecting me, sir.

610
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,545
What did you wanna go over there for?

611
00:44:37,622 --> 00:44:39,385
Well, l figured that was a good place to be

612
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,154
because they had to rear up
and show themselves

613
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:44,752
in order to shoot at me
and the rest of the boys back here.

614
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,695
And whenever they did,
l could touch 'em off.

615
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:47,789
l see.

616
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:51,632
So, l went up the hill,
up around that a-way,

617
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:55,700
then worked my way down the ridge
to a place where they was flanked

618
00:44:55,774 --> 00:44:58,470
and couldn't show themselves
without being hit.

619
00:44:58,577 --> 00:45:01,137
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.

620
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:03,078
How many did you kill?

621
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,182
l don't rightly know, sir.

622
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:08,481
l think Captain Danforth
is familiar with that, sir.

623
00:45:08,553 --> 00:45:11,989
We counted about 20 bodies altogether
up around there.

624
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:15,186
What were your men doing
all this time, Corporal?

625
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,784
Well, l couldn't just answer that, sir.

626
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:19,763
l was pretty busy
and l reckon they was, too.

627
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:23,332
According to the statements of the others,
they were guarding the prisoners

628
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:26,894
and couldn't expose themselves
to the fire from the ridge.

629
00:45:26,972 --> 00:45:29,873
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.

630
00:45:34,646 --> 00:45:35,908
Corporal.

631
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:40,848
-There's something that l'd like to know.
-Yes, sir?

632
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:43,714
That night that you reported back to me
at Camp Gordon,

633
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:47,054
you as much as told me that you were
quite prepared to die for your country,

634
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,717
but not to kill.

635
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:52,725
What made you
decide to change your mind?

636
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:54,564
Well, sir...

637
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,794
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,
why, it's quite all right.

638
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,565
Well, l'm as much against killing as ever,
sir.

639
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:02,639
But it was this way, Colonel.

640
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,737
When l started out l felt just like you said.

641
00:46:05,811 --> 00:46:07,904
But when l hear them
machine guns a-going

642
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:10,470
and all them fellows
are dropping around me,

643
00:46:10,582 --> 00:46:14,643
l figured that them guns
was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,

644
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:17,916
and there weren't nothing anybody
could do, but to stop them guns.

645
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:19,854
And that's what l done.

646
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:23,120
You mean to tell me
that you did it to save lives?

647
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:25,663
Yes, sir. That was why.

648
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:33,197
Well, York, what you've just told me
is the most extraordinary thing of all.

649
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:37,064
Sergeant York!

650
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,261
Thank you, sir.

651
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,500
And for conspicuous gallantry
beyond the call of duty,

652
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:14,977
you have been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross.

653
00:47:20,252 --> 00:47:23,744
Sergeant York, l am proud that
you are of the All-American Division.

654
00:47:23,822 --> 00:47:26,689
lt's a privilege to command
such men as you.

655
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:32,162
Sergeant York,

656
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,996
as Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces,

657
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:38,695
it is my pleasure to confer upon you

658
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,261

659
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:43,830
for heroism beyond the call of duty.

660
00:47:46,077 --> 00:47:47,601
Thank you, sir.

661
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:16,303
l'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,

662
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,274
representative from
your district of Tennessee.

663
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:20,470
l'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.

664
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:22,979
And this is Mr. Harrison
from the Tennessee Society.

665
00:48:23,048 --> 00:48:24,982
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.

666
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,075
-Thank you.
-This way, Sergeant.

667
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,624
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?

668
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,965
Appears like everybody's
having a mighty good time.

669
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,796
So, Sergeant,
in the name of the people of New York,

670
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:50,340
may l present you with this key to our city

671
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:52,933
as a token of our very great esteem.

672
00:48:53,078 --> 00:48:54,943
And may God bless you.

673
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:58,544
Thank you for what you said,

674
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:01,381
and l'm sure grateful to you
for this here key.

675
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:03,944
Well, thank you. And thank you all.

676
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:09,193
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York
would like to show their appreciation.

677
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,023
ls there anything we can do for you?

678
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:13,121
Well, there's just one thing
l'd like to ask you.

679
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:14,324
And that is?

680
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:15,923
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,

681
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:19,835
l sure would like to ride on the subway
on the Bronx Express.

682
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:21,533
l think we can arrange that.

683
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,537
Well, here we are.

684
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:34,915
l hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.

685
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:36,851
Well, if it ain't, l'd be pretty hard to please.

686
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:39,754
lf there's anything you require,
all you will have to do is ask for it.

687
00:49:39,824 --> 00:49:41,724
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

688
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:45,786
An awful lot of room
for just one fellow here.

689
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:04,247
This here is mighty thoughtful of you,
gentlemen.

690
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:07,113
l reckon you know l ain't seen my ma
for quite a spell.

691
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:09,312
So we understand.

692
00:50:15,493 --> 00:50:17,256
Representative Hull.

693
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:20,558
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?

694
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:22,731
Put them on.

695
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:25,333
-Somebody for you, Sergeant.
-Me?

696
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:29,938
Thank you.

697
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:35,270
Hello. Hello there.

698
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:39,575
What?

699
00:50:41,453 --> 00:50:42,784
Who is it?

700
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:47,422
l... l can't hear you.

701
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,088
-Who is it?
-What's that you're saying?

702
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:52,760
l can't hear you.

703
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:54,799
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.

704
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:56,299
Stand closer, Ma.

705
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,699
When are you coming home, Alvin?

706
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:03,101
l said, when are you coming home?

707
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:08,005
Oh, l'm glad, Son.

708
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,238
l'll tell her.

709
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:13,310
She's right here.

710
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:16,585
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.

711
00:51:18,556 --> 00:51:21,081
lt's me, Alvin. lt's me, Gracie!

712
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:24,051
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.

713
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:26,620
He's got this here phone in here now.

714
00:51:26,698 --> 00:51:29,531
Oh, l just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.

715
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:31,692
l can't wait to see you.

716
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,069
Yeah, yeah. l'll be coming home, Gracie,
right away.

717
00:51:35,573 --> 00:51:36,665
Yeah.

718
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:40,876
-Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
-Goodbye, Alvin.

719
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:43,471
Bye.

720
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,320
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.

721
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:56,792
-l'm a-thanking you.
-You're welcome, Sergeant.

722
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:24,788
Just like the electric signs
down the street.

723
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:31,493
How do you like New York, Alvin,
as much as you've seen of it?

724
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,995
-Mr. Hull?
-Yes, Alvin?

725
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,067
l wanna be a-going home.

726
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:39,069
When do you think l can go?

727
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:41,970
-You're pretty anxious, l reckon.
-Yes, sir, l am.

728
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:44,399
l've got to get to work.

729
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:47,808
Well, as far as that goes,
there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.

730
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:48,868
What do you mean?

731
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:51,347
l've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

732
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,407
You're a pretty famous man now.

733
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:56,112
And judging by all these offers
you've been getting,

734
00:52:56,187 --> 00:52:58,417
it seems a lot of people realize it.

735
00:52:58,489 --> 00:52:59,956
For instance,

736
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:03,258
two companies want you
in motion pictures,

737
00:53:03,328 --> 00:53:06,024
Ziegfeld wants you in an act
in his new Follies.

738
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:09,294
And here's an offer to appear
at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.

739
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:13,394
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer
who wants you to endorse his product.

740
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:15,234
What does that mean?

741
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,468
Well, you've to tell him how much
you like it, how much good it's done you.

742
00:53:21,112 --> 00:53:24,138
l ain't never ate
any of that there breakfast food.

743
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:26,012
Doesn't seem to make any difference.

744
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:28,575
Anyway, l've totaled the offers so far

745
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:31,622
and they amount to around
a quarter of million dollars.

746
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:33,748
They're offering me all that money?

747
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:36,521
lt's just a plain business proposition.

748
00:53:37,195 --> 00:53:40,323
l sure could do a powerful sight
with that money.

749
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:42,989
There was a piece of bottomland
l was a-trying to get...

750
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,297
Here's your chance to get it.

751
00:53:47,105 --> 00:53:50,666
Are they offering that money
because of what happened over there?

752
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:53,176
-Well...
-That's it, ain't it?

753
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:55,843
That's it.

754
00:53:57,248 --> 00:53:59,773
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?

755
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:03,818
Well, l think that's up to you, Alvin.

756
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:05,712
l reckon it is.

757
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,825
Take all the time you want to think it over.

758
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,459
l've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.

759
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:14,362
l ain't proud of what happened over there.

760
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:17,696
What we done in France
was something we had to do.

761
00:54:17,802 --> 00:54:20,600
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.

762
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:25,736
So, the way l figure,
things like that ain't for buying and selling.

763
00:54:25,843 --> 00:54:27,504
So l reckon l'll have to refuse 'em.

764
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:30,672
Would you be a-telling them that
for me, please?

765
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:33,146
And tell 'em l'm a-going home?

766
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:40,014
-l'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
-Thank you, Mr. Hull.

767
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,989
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.

768
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:02,337
Oh, there he is!

769
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:19,657
Alvin!

770
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:21,289
Oh, Alvin!

771
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:23,060
How are you?

772
00:55:44,722 --> 00:55:46,189
Ma, l'm back.

773
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,421
l'm right glad, Son.

774
00:55:52,497 --> 00:55:54,931
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?

775
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,293
-What about 'em, George?
-l thought you'd be wearing 'em.

776
00:55:58,369 --> 00:55:59,597
You'll be a-seeing 'em.

777
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,104
They better be a-something big.

778
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,671
As l was saying, Alvin,

779
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:07,177
of course, l always figured
on marrying you and Gracie myself,

780
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:10,180
but l ain't one to take the job away
from the Governor of the State.

781
00:56:10,248 --> 00:56:12,910
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero
raised in these parts

782
00:56:12,984 --> 00:56:14,747
since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.

783
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,184
Sure are, Alvin.

784
00:56:16,854 --> 00:56:18,378
Hang on, Rosie.

785
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:21,715
Hey,

786
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,787
what about that there piece of land
l was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?

787
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:28,354
-lt's still there, l reckon?
-Yep, it's still there.

788
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:30,993
Somebody else has got it by now,
l suppose.

789
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:35,130
Well, l couldn't rightly expect Zeb
to hold it for me all this time.

790
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,572
l sure would like to see that there
piece of land, though.

791
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:39,872
l reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.

792
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:42,037
l'd like to be a-seeing it, too.

793
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:46,071
l'll let you off at the fork and
you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.

794
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:49,146
Hang on, everyone.

795
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:54,281
Hey, look here.

796
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:59,825
-Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
-Yeah, they have.

797
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:03,099
Gracie, l... l gotta talk to you.

798
00:57:03,668 --> 00:57:05,533
lt wasn't just the land
l was a-wanting to see.

799
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:08,265
There's something we got to talk about.

800
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:11,569
-Miss Gracie, l'm plumb worried.
-What about, Alvin?

801
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,507
Well, what with the governor fixing
to marry us

802
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:15,273
and all them people coming here
from all over...

803
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:18,804
Sure takes a body's breath away,
but l reckon we'll get through it all right.

804
00:57:18,883 --> 00:57:22,250
-Well, it ain't just that l'm worried about.
-Well, what then?

805
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,518
Well, it sure looks like l ain't got nothing
to offer you excepting a big wedding.

806
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:28,855
Why, some girls don't even get that.

807
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,454
Well, l reckon you'd like a place to sleep,
wouldn't you?

808
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,997
Oh, l don't know.

809
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:36,329
l done a heap of sleeping
while you was away.

810
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,460
You sure ain't expecting
too much of a husband.

811
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:41,797
l'm expecting my husband to love me.

812
00:57:41,873 --> 00:57:44,398
l reckon the good Lord
will take care of the rest.

813
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:46,966
Well, looks like he's done a heap already,

814
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:49,035
just a-having you. But...

815
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,909
Well, l was expecting to take over
from here myself.

816
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:55,578
l reckon you'll get to do your share.

817
00:57:56,187 --> 00:57:58,951
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.

818
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,479
We got to wait.

819
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:03,857
Maybe in another two or three years,
if you're willing to wait...

820
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:05,793
Oh, but l ain't, that's the point.

821
00:58:05,863 --> 00:58:09,492
-You mean you won't wait?
-There ain't no need of waiting.

822
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:13,563
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down
and don't you be looking up till l tell you.

823
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:15,800
Come on.

824
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:23,770
There! Now you can look.

825
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:26,747
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.

826
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:29,987
lt's yours, Alvin. lt's all yours.
They give it to you.

827
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:32,887
The people of the state of Tennessee
for what you done.

828
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:34,891
-You mean...
-Only, it's 200 acres

829
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:39,020
and the house is bigger, with more
windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.

830
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:41,289
And it's for us.

831
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,704
The Lord sure does move
in mysterious ways.

832
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:52,270
Come on.
