伦敦  皮卡迪利大街145号

43
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,080
深深吸进肺里  殿下
Inhale deep into your lungs... Your Royal Highness.

44
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,990
这能放松您的喉咙  是吧
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

45
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,240
吸烟让您精神放松并给您自信
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.

46
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,750
殿下  请您张开手

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,930
这是消过毒的

四  五  六  七
four, five, six, seven.

50
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,590
恕我冒昧
Now, if I may take the liberty,

51
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,790
请把它们含在嘴里
insert them into your mouth.

52
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,250
抱歉  医生  请问这样做是为了什么
Excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?

53
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,480
这是传统疗法  它治好了德摩斯梯尼(古希腊雄辩家)
It is the classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.

54
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
那是在古希腊
That was in Ancient Greece.

55
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,700
现在还管用吗
Has it worked since?

56
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,440
现在  请您读一下
Now, if you would be so kind as to read.

57
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,820
这几段话
"A wealth of words."

58
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,660
克服那些弹珠的阻碍  殿下
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.

59
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,490
读出来
Enunciate!

60
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,110
再专心一点  殿下 
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.

61
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,290
我差点吞了这些该死的玩意儿
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

62
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,780
谢谢您  医生
Thank you so much, Doctor,

63
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,440
这非常  有意思
it's been most, hmm... interesting.

64
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,920
殿下
Your highness.

65
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,340
含  弹珠
Insert... marbles!

66
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,060
他自己怎么不含
He can insert his own bloody marbles.

67
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,780
滴答  滴答
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

68
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
你不能总这样  博迪
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.

69
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,030
我知道
I know.

70
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,480
答应我  答应我  治疗到此为止
Promise me. Promise me, no more.

71
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,500
哈里街

72
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,600
查普曼医生
L・罗格  语言障碍

73
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,690
你好  有人在吗
Hello. Is anyone there?

74
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,500
我在厕所里
I'm just in the loo.

75
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,900
约翰逊夫人  您来了
Ah, Mrs.Johnson, there you are.

76
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
抱歉  我这没前台  我喜欢简单
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist. I like to keep things simple.

77
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,460
"乐而安贫就是富"
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."

78
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,160
-什么  -莎士比亚说的  您好
- I'm Sorry?  - Shakespeare. How are you?

79
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,500
您好
How do you do?

80
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,700
我近来咳嗽不断
Oh, chuffing along.

81
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,760
这有点棘手  但是  恐怕您迟到了
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.

82
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,990
是的  恐怕是的
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

83
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,940
约翰逊先生呢
Where's Mr Johnson?

84
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,750
他不知道我来
Ah... He doesn't know I'm here.

85
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,430
这个开头可不好
That's not a promising start.

86
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,440
是  是不好  情形是
No. No, look,

87
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,080
我丈夫求医无数  皆无好转
my husband has seen everyone to no avail.

88
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,910
恐怕他已经放弃了
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.

89
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,880
他还没见过我
He hasn't seen me.

90
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
你很自信
You're awfully sure of yourself.

91
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,100
我对每个期望治好的人都满怀信心
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.

92
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,600
当然他想要治好
Of course, he wishes to be cured.

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,140
我丈夫  需要在公开场合讲话
My husband is um... Well, he's required to speak publicly.

94
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,000
或许他该换个工作
Perhaps he should change jobs?

95
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,610
没法换
He can't.

96
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,060
卖身契
Indentured servitude?

97
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
差不多
Something of that nature. Yes.

98
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,610
那么  你老公得过来
Well we need to have your hubby pop by.

99
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,990
周二可以
Uh..Tuesday would be good...

100
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,990
他可以跟我说下个人情况
He can give me his personal details

101
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,630
我来做个准确评估  然后开始治疗
and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.

102
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
抱歉  医生
Doctor, forgive me.

103
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,100
我不称他为老公  我们也不过来
I do not have a hubby. We don't pop.

104
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,430
更不对外人讲我们的私生活
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.

105
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,680
您  必须来我家
You... must come to us.

106
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,450
抱歉  约翰逊夫人  我的地盘听我的
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.

107
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,490
你得说服你丈夫
You'll have to talk over this with your husband

108
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,260
然后给我打电话
and then you can speak to me on the telephone.

109
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,890
感谢你来访  再见
Thank you very much for dropping by... Good afternoon.

110
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,270
如果我丈夫是约克公爵呢
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?

111
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,030
约克公爵
The Duke of York?

112
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,930
是的  约克公爵
Yes... the Duke of York.

113
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,160
我以为预约的是约翰逊  抱歉  殿...
I thought the appointment was for Johnson? Forgive me, your ...?

114
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,960
殿下
Royal Highness.

115
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,880
大战时他用这个姓
Johnson was used during the Great War;

116
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,660
皇家海军不想让敌人知道他在船上
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know he was aboard.

117
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,840
我被当成敌人吗
Am I...considered the enemy?

118
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,850
是的  如果您不合作  
You will be, if you remain unobliging.

119
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,540
而且你得严格保密
And you have to have abosolute descretion.

120
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,750
当然  殿下  您是怎么找到我的
Of course. How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?

121
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,170
通过语言矫治协会的会长
The President of society of the Speech Therapists.

122
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,730
艾琳・麦克卢尔  她是我的朋友
Eileen McCleod? She's a sport.

123
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,450
麦克卢尔医生提醒我说
Dr McCleod warned me your

124
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,020
您的澳洲式疗法是异端而且颇有争议
antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.

125
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,590
我告诉她  我不爱听那些词
I warned her... those were not my favorite words.

126
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,660
我可以为您丈夫治疗
I can cure your husband.

127
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,850
但用我的办法需要信任和彻底的平等
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;

128
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,230
并在我的诊室里进行
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.

129
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,100
概不例外
No exceptions.

130
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,930
那么  既然这样
Well then, in that case...

131
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,800
您什么时候可以开始
When can you start?

132
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,520
听起来还是有点刺耳  小伙子
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.

133
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,400
是你让我开得太慢了  老爸 
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

134
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,420
你去桥那边接你妈了吗
Did you pick mum up from bridge?

135
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,210
是的  一整天我都开着车到处跑
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.

136
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,560
今天下午  来了位特别的客人
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

137
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,400
-我可以离桌了吧  -怎么个特别法
- May I please leave this table.  - How special, special?

138
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,010
不行  小蠢蛋
No, You must stay, bored stupid,

139
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,200
你得留下来听你爸妈无聊的谈话

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,150
不能说提它干嘛

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,150
莫特尔  只是一个女人  想帮她丈夫

149
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,840
还有  我接到一个电话

得到一个试镜机会

151
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,610
-我的最爱之一  -所有角色不都是你最爱吗

152
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,490
很有意思的角色
It could be a lot of fun.

153
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,650
我相信你会做得很好
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

154
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,320
是个有威望的剧团
They're a highly regarded group.

155
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,440
来自普特尼

156
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,380
明天读第四章
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.

157
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,300
飞行
The flight

158
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,770
-我都不知道他会飞  -我都等不及了
- Mama, I don't know they fly at all. - I can't wait

159
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,010
飞走了
Oh, to fly away

160
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,780
他们不是很幸运吗
Weren't they lucky!

161
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,960
那爸爸讲个故事吧
Now Papa tell a story!

162
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,140
我装企鹅还不行吗
Could I be a penguin instead?

163
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,280
我想听企鹅的故事
Well, now I want a penguin story.

164
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,450
讲个短的
Very quickly.

165
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,590
从前  有两个公主
Once, there were two princesses.

166
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,730
伊丽莎白公主和玛格丽特公主
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.

167
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,390
她们的爸爸是只企鹅
whose Papa was a penguin.

168
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,610
因为邪恶的女巫对他施了魔咒
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.

169
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,920
这让他为难
This was an inconvenient for him.

170
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,350
因为他喜欢用手怀抱两个公主
Because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms...

171
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,320
但企鹅不行  因为他长着青鱼般的翅膀
and penguin can't because he has wings like herrings.

172
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,700
青鱼没有翅膀
Herrings don't have wings.

173
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,340
企鹅翅膀的形状像青鱼
Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings...

174
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,020
但更糟的是
and make matters worse...

175
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,700
女巫把他扔到了南极
is that she sent him to the South Pole.

176
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,130
回来的路很遥远
which is an awfully long walk back.

177
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,940
除非会飞
if you can't fly.

178
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,290
所以  他来到水边
So... When he reached the water,

179
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,330
迅速潜入水中
he dived in through the dept so fast...

180
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,150
中午时他已抵达南汉普顿海域
that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.

181
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,080
在那儿搭两点半的船
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge,

182
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,530
然后在克拉珀姆换船
changed at Clapham Junction and...

183
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,660
向一只路过的野鸭打听去白金汉宫的路
asked a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.

184
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,790
他游过泰晤士河  从出水孔里钻出来
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole,

185
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,370
让厨师
and gave the cook,

186
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,700
妈妈还有惠特克太太吃了一惊
Mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.

187
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,950
女孩儿们听到了一片混乱
Now when the girls heard all the commotions,

188
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,240
她们跑进厨房给他彻底地洗了个澡
they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub,

189
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,900
并给了他一条马鲛鱼和一个吻
a mackerel and a kiss.

190
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,790
当她们吻他时
and as they kissed him,

191
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,970
猜他变成了什么
guess what he turned into?

192
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,740
一个英俊的王子
A handsome prince.

193
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,490
一只短尾巴的信天翁
A short-tailed Albatross.

194
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,540
有一双大翅膀
With wings so big...

195
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,640
这样他就可以一把搂过他的两个女儿了
that he could wrap them both his two girls together.

196
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,790
好了  该睡觉了  快点
Now, now... It's time for bed. Come on.

197
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,500
把这两匹小马拉回马厩
Take these horses to stable.

198
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
-动作快  就给你们1分钟  -晚安

喂食  刷洗然后睡觉
Feed them, bath them and to bed.

200
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,790
辛普森夫人会参加吗
Will Mrs Simpson be there?

201
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
我哥哥坚持让她来
My brother's insisting.

202
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,090
他是认真的吗
Is he serious?

203
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,550
让她参加晚宴吗
About her coming to dinner?

204
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,230
不是  对她
No, about her.

205
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,980
一个有夫之妇  他不会的
A married woman? He can't be.

206
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,980
她会
She can.

207
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,310
对了 我发现一个很有趣的人
By the way, I think I found someone rather interesting.

208
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,660
在哈里大街  一个医生
On Harley Street. A doctor.

209
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,660
绝不
Out of the question.

210
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:20,470
我不想再谈了  到此为止
I'm not having this conversation again. The matter's settled.

211
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
他的方法好像很特别
His approach seems rather different....

212
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,840
现在开始吗
Now?

213
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,780
开始
Now.

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,380
如今约克之子把我们讨厌的冬天
"Now is the winter of our discontent,

215
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,150
变成了灿烂的夏天

所有掠过我们家园的乌云

217
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,890
都被深埋在海洋的怀抱中
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

218
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,690
现在  我们的双眉周围缠绕着凯旋的花环
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths."

219
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,890

罗格先生
Well, Mr.Logue.

223
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,970
我听不出这是一个丑陋的家伙
I'm not hearing the cries

224
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,510
想要成为国王的呐喊
of a deformed creature yearning to be King.

225
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,700
也看不出理查三世像殖民地的国王
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.

226
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,430
我知道所有台词  我演过这角色
I do know all the lines. I've played the role before.

227
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,420

228
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,070
剧场很多的城镇  对吧
Major theater town, is it?

229
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,650
很狂热
Enthusiastic.

230
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,510
我经过了层层筛选
I was well reviewed.

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,010
莱昂内尔
Yes... well, Lionel,

232
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,520
我们的戏剧社
I think our dramatic society,

233
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,330
想找个年轻点的

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,440
更有帝王气质的人
little more regal.

235
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
得先关上外面那个  再把这个往前推
You have to shut that one first. Put that one forth.

236
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
很好
Excellent.

237
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,980
你在哪找到的这个医生
Where did you find this... physician?

238
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,110
分类广告
Classifieds,

239
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,970
紧挨着"法国模特  请联系牧羊菜市场"那条
next to 'French model, Shepherd's Market'.

240
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,770
有人强烈推荐他
He comes highly recommended.

241
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,740
为了救济穷人他收取高昂的费用
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.

242
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,090
天啊  或许他是共产主义者
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!

243
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,590
没有前台  他喜欢简单
Ah, there's no receptionist. Likes to keep things simple.

244
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,400
我们是约翰逊夫妇
Uh... The Johnsons.

245
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,210
你可以进去了  约翰逊先生
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.

246
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,700
莱昂内尔说
Lionel says...

247
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,870
如果你愿意可以在这等  约翰逊夫人
wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.

248
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,580
或者
Or, it being a...

249
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,760
天气不错  
pleasant day...

250
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,360
也许您可以去散步
perhaps take a stroll.

251
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,010
我说的对吗  莱昂内尔
Was that alright... Lionel?

252
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,220
棒极了  维利  
Marvellous! Willy.

253
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,760
在这等妈妈来接你吧
You can stay and wait for your mom.

254
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,570
约翰逊夫人
Mrs Johnson...

255
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,770
约翰逊先生  您请进
Mr Johnson, Do you come in?

256

你喜欢糖果吗?
Would you like a sweetie?

257
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,700
维利是个好孩子
He's a good lad, Willy.

258
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,030
第一次来见我时
He could hardly make a sound, you know,

259
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,930
他几乎一个音都发不出
when he first came to me.

260
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,700
我儿子们的杰作  不错吧
My boys made those. They're good, aren't they?

261
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,390
请随意
Please make yourself comfortable.

262
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,970
有人告诉我不要坐得太近
I was told not to sit too close.

263
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,910
我认为和王子说话时
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,

264
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,710
要等王子选话题
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.

265
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,650
让我开始谈话
Waiting for me to... commence

266
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,020
那得等很久
a conversation, one can wait a rather long wait.

267
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,400
呵  这样
Ah, yes, well...

268
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,500
您知道什么笑话吗
Do you know any jokes?

269
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
计时不是我的强项
Timing isn't my strong suit.

270
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,130
喝茶吗
Cup of tea?

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,410
不  谢谢
No thank you.

272
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,300
我要来一杯 
I think I'll have one.

273
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,550
罗格医生您还不开始治疗吗
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr Logue?

274
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,230
除非您愿意被治疗
Only if you're interested in being treated.

275
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,730
请叫我莱昂内尔
Please, call me Lionel.

276
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,130
我更愿称你为先生
I prefer Doctor.

277
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,820
我更愿被称为莱昂内尔  
I prefer Lionel.

278
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,900
-我该怎么称呼您  -殿下
- What will I call you? - Your Royal Highness.

279
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,930
之后可以称阁下 
Then... it's "sir" after that.

280
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,810
在这个场合太正式了  您的名字是
A little bit formal for here. I prefer names.

281
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,060
阿尔伯特・弗雷德里克・亚瑟・乔治王子
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George.

282
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
叫博迪怎样
How about Bertie?

283
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,700
-只有我的家人那么叫  -很好  
- Only my family uses that. - Perfect.

284
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,370
在这里  我们平等相处比较好
In here, it's better if we're equals.

285
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,560
如果我们真平等  我就不用来了
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.

286
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,660
在家陪妻子
I'd be... at home with my wife

287
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
谁管我结不结巴
and no one would give a damn.

288
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,270
请不要抽烟
Please, Don't do that.

289
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,880
不要什么
I'm sorry?

290
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,150
我认为抽烟对您的健康不利
I believe, sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.

291
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,980
我的医生说这能放松喉...  喉咙
My physicians say it relaxes the... the throat.

292
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,900
-一群白痴  -他们都是御医
- They're idiots. - They've all been knighted.

293
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,100
那就是官方认证的白痴
Makes it official then.

294
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,460
我的地盘我做主
My castle, my rules.

295
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,890
谢谢
Thank you.

296
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,820
请问你最早的记忆是
What was your earliest memory?

297
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,020
什  什么意思
What on earth do you mean?

298
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
你记得的第一件事
Your first recollection.

299
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,320
我不
I'm not...

300
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,490
不是来谈私事的
here to discuss my personal matters.

301
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,770
那您来干什么
Why're you here then?

302
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,190
因为我他妈的结巴
Because I am bloody well stammer!

303
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,140
您还有点脾气
You have a bit of a temper?

304
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,330
诸多缺点中的一个
One of my many faults.

305
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,210
结巴是从何时开始的
When did the defect start?

306
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,740
一直都这样
I've always been this way!

307
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
我觉得不是
I doubt that.

308
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,610
你知道什么  结巴的是我
Don't tell me! It's my stammer!

309
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,180
可我是专家  我向您保证  
It's my field. I can assure you,

310
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,090
口吃绝非天生
no infant starts to speak with a stammer.

311
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,810
您是几岁开始的
When did yours start?

312
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,970
四五岁
Four or five.

313
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,480
一般都是这个年纪
That's typical.

314
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,970
都这么说
So I've been told.

315
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,550
我记事起就结巴了
I can't remember not doing it.

316
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,750
我知道
I can believe that.

317
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,380
您思考的时候也会停顿吗
Do you hesitate when you think?

318
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,050
胡说
Don't be ridiculous.

319
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,700
自言自语时呢
How about when you talk to yourself?

320
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,510
博迪  所有人都会偶尔自言自语
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.

321
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,200
别那么叫我
Stop... stop calling me that.

322
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,510
我就这么叫
I'm not going to call you anything else.

323
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,050
那就没什么好说了
Then we shan't speak!

324
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,760
医生  你收钱吗
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

325
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,490
收一大笔呢
A fortune.

326
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,320
泡一会再喝
I'll just let that brew.

327
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,510
那么  自言自语时  你结巴吗
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?

328
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,600
不结巴  当然不会
No... of course not!

329
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,770
那证明您的口吃不是天生的
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.

330
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,610
你觉得病因是什么
What do you think was the cause?

331
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
我不 不知道
I don't... don't know.

332
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,620
我...  我也不...  不在乎  
I... I don't... I don't care!

333
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,000
我就是结巴
I... I stammer!

334
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,280
没人能治好
And no one can fix it.

335
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,270
我打赌  您此时此刻就能流利地朗诵
I bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.

336
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,010
要是我赢  我就要问您更多问题 
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.

337
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,790
-如果我赢呢  -您不必回答
- And if I win? - You don't have to answer.

338
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,630
一般人都  都赌钱
One usually... wagers money.

339
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,600
每人一先令作为开始
A bob each to keep it sweet?

340
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,500
-你出一先令  -我不  不带钱
- Let's see your shilling. - I don't... carry money.

341
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,700
就知道您没有
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

342
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,160
我借您  下回还我
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.

343
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,950
谁说有下回
Who says there is a next time?

344
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,650
那倒是  我还没决定给您治疗
I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.

345
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,260
请起立  看看这个
Please stand. And take a look at that.

346
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,900
我读  读不了
I can't... I can't read this.

347
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,850
您都没试就输给我一先令
Well, then you owe me a shilling, for not trying.

348
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,340
活着  还是死去  这...
To be... or not to be, that...

349
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,000
我读不了
I can't read!

350
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,350
还没完呢
I haven't finished yet.

351
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,580
我用这机器给您录音
I'm going to record your voice

352
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,950
再放出来给您听
and then play it back to you on the same machine.

353
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,410
这机器棒极了
This is brilliant.

354
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,810
美国的最新产品  银音牌
It's the latest thing from America. It's a Silvertone.

355
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,800
戴上这个
Pop this on?

356
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,600
伙计  这能赚一先令  您可以满载而归
There's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!

357
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,260
-这在放音乐  -我知道
- You're playing music. - I know.

358
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,690
那我怎么听见自己说什么
So how can I hear what I'm saying?

359
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,750
王子的脑子肯定知道嘴在说什么
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing.

360
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,200
你一定不了解王子
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

361
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,090
完全没用
Hopeless. Hopeless!

362
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,210
您读得非常好
You were sublime.

363
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,390
我怎么会为了一先令欺骗王子殿下
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve pence?

364
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,650
我怎么知道一个澳洲人
I've no idea... what an Australian might do

365
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,080
为了那点钱会做出什么
for that sort of money.

366
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,890
我放出来给您听听
Let me play it back to you.

367
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,600
不用
No.

368
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,970
那好吧  我就要提问了
All right then, I get to ask you the question.

369
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,970
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor,

370
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
我觉得这治不好我
I don't feel... this is for me.

371
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,650
麻烦你了  再见
Thank You for your time, Bye.

372
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,440
阁下
Sir?

373
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,080
录音是免费的
The recording is free.

374
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,780
请收下做纪念
Please keep it as a souvenir.

375
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,480
没用
No.

376
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,800
乔治五世

377
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,800
1934年圣诞讲话

378
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,800
诺福克郡  桑德林姆宫

379
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,970
当前形势下
For the present,

380
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,550
我们共同担当的重任
the work to which we are all equally bound,

381
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,810
便是在全国之内
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity

382
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,000
营造和平平静的环境
within our borders,

383
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,610
在此萧条期间
to regain prosperity at this time of depression,

384
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,490
摒弃私心
without self-seeking...

385
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,970
与我们这些为之前的重负倍感灰心与挫折的人
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years...

386
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,380
再图繁荣
has disheartened or overborne.

387
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,600
祝每位国民圣诞快乐
To all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.

388
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,800
上帝保佑你们
God bless you.

389
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,490
直播结束
And off air.

390
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,090
熟能生巧
Easy when you know how.

391
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,500
阁下
Sir.

392
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,200
你来试试
Have a go yourself.

393
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,480
-演讲很成功  陛下  -伍德先生
- Congratulations, Sir. - Mr. Wood.

394
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,110
他很厉害  
Splendid fellow.

395
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,410
教会我最重要的一条
Chap taught me everything I know.

396
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,230
麦克风自然会播音
Let the microphone do the work.

397
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,970
-阁下  -谢谢  
- Sir. - Thank you.

398
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,460
各位这边走
Gentlemen.

399
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,330
挺胸坐直
Sit up, straight back,

400
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,510
抬头面对话筒  直视它
face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye,

401
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,510
当它是个平民
as you would any decent Englishman.

402
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,130
拿出皇家气派
Show who's in command.

403
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,640
爸爸  我觉得我读不了
Papa, I don't think I can read this.

404
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,000
如果读不了  这该死的东西能毁了一切
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.

405
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,930
过去一个国王要做的事情
In the past all a King had to do was

406
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,930
就是穿上正装摆摆样子  别掉下马
look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.

407
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,830
现在我们必须进入平常百姓家
Now, we must invade people's homes...

408
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,610
去讨好他们
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

409
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,360
所谓皇室家族
This family's been reduced

410
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,800
已经降为最低等的平民
to those lowest, basest of all creatures.

411
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,900
我们变成了演员
We've become actors!

412
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,720
我们不是皇室  而是公司
We're not a family, we're a firm.

413
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,700
然而某些成员随时会失业
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.

414
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,700
你的兄长  我的王储
Your darling brother, and future king!

415
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,110
他唯一感兴趣的妻子
The only wife he appears interested in

416
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,070
无一例外都是有夫之妇
is invariably the wife of another!

417
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,520
他和弗勒斯女士分手了
He's broken off with Lady Furness.

418
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,860
又看上了辛普森夫人
And taken up a Mrs. Simpson,

419
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,240
一个已经结过两次婚的女人
a woman with two husbands living!

420
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,620
我跟他直说
I told him straight,

421
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,930
皇室不会接受这种女人
no divorced person could ever be received at court.

422
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,710
他说他感到十分幸福
He said it made him sublimely happy.

423
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,800
我想这是因为她已经和他上床了
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.

424
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,030
他说  "我保证"
"I give you my word," this is what he said.

425
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,720
"我们绝没发生不正当关系"
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations."

426
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,550
当着他父亲的面撒谎
stared square into his father's face and lied!

427
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,020
等我死了  他用不了一年
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself,

428
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,340
就会毁掉自己  毁掉这个家族  毁掉这个国家
this family and this nation within twelve months.

429
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,670
到时谁收拾残局
Who'll pick up the pieces, hmm?

430
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,730
希特勒震慑了半个欧洲
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.

431
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,470
另半个在马歇尔・斯大林掌控
Marshall Stalin the other half.

432
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,000
谁来保护英国
Who'll stand between us,

433
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,480
免遭纳粹军队和无产阶级的侵犯
the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?

434
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,600
你能行吗
You?

435
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,660
这样的话  
Well,

436
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,120
你哥哥逃避责任
with your older brother shirking his duties,

437
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,600
你势必将更多地做这事情
you're going to have to do a lot more of this.

438
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,340
你自己来一次
Have a go yourself.

439
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,360
-通过无线电  -别紧张  孩子
- With the wireless... - Get it out, boy!

440
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:27,310
-这一伟大的  现  -现代
- one of the... marvels of... - Modern.

441
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,600
慢慢来  小心组词 
Just take your time, form your words carefully.

442
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,480
-现代科技  我能够  -放松
- science, I am enabled... - Relax!

443
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,600
-大胆说  -在这个圣诞节
- Just try it! - This Chrismas Day...

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,340
向我的...
to speak to all my...

445
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,100
说啊
Do it!

446
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,200
骗人的混蛋
Lying .. bastard.

447
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,280
-这在放音乐  -我知道
- "You're playing music. - I know.

448
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,000
我怎么知道自己说什么
So how can I hear what I'm saying?

449
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,900
王子的大脑肯定知道嘴在说什么
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?

450
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,070
你不了解王子
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

451
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,790
活着  还是死去  这是个难题
To be, or not to be, that is the question.

452
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,970
哪一种选择更为高贵
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer...

453
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,100
是甘心忍受残暴命运的飞箭流石
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

454
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,500
还是奋起搏击无边的苦海
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

455
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,240
通过反抗一了百了
and by opposing end them?

456
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,080
死去  睡去  仅此而已
To die, to sleep no more,

457
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,740
如果说睡去能了结
and by a sleep to say we end...

458
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,540
肉体注定要承受的伤心
is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks...

459
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,260
以及千百次的打击  那可是...
that flesh is heir to. Tis a consummation...

460
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,900
完全没用
Hopeless. Hopeless!"

461
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,370
只能治病
Strictly business.

462
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:32,310
别  打听私事
No... personal nonsense.

463
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,570
我想在之前的会面我已经说清楚了
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.

464
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,410
欠我那一先令带了吗
Have you got the shilling you owe me?

465
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,080
没带
No, I haven't.

466
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,580
没想到
Didn't think so.

467
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,540
而且上次你耍花招了
Besides, you tricked me!

468
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,310
身体操练和花招很重要
Physical excercises and tricks are important...

469
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,380
你们的要求
What you're asking

470
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,090
只能治标不治本
will only deal with the surface of the problem.

471
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,100
那不是更有效吗
Is that effecient?

472
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,000
在我看来
No, as far as I see it,

473
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,070
我丈夫只是在演讲时有身体上的困难
my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.

474
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,010
也许处理这个就可以了
Maybe just deal with that.

475
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,100
我愿意刻苦练习  罗格医生  
I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue.

476
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,200
叫我莱昂内尔
Lionel.

477
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,830
你愿意治我吗
Are you... are you willing to do your part?

478
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,030
行  你想治身体对吧
Alright. You want mechanics?

479
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,340
我要放松你的颚肌  
We need to relax your jaw muscles

480
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,400
练习绕口令  锻炼舌头
and strengthen your tongue by repeating tongue twisters

481
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,300
比如说  四是四  十是十
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.

482
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,900
十四是十四
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and...

483
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,840
四十是四十
a sieve of unsifted thistles because I am a thistle-sifter.

484
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,760
行
Fine!

485
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,930
你的腹肌比较松软
You do have a flabby tummys,

486
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,520
我们要花时间增强你的横膈膜力量
we need spend some times to strength in your diaphragm.

487
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,820
很简单的物理治疗
Simple mechanics.

488
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,840
我们就需要这个
That is all we ask.

489
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,010
那我只收一先令就够了
And that's about a shilling's worth.

490
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,520
别提他妈的先令
Forget about the bloody shilling!

491
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,800
我可能时不时地
Perhaps, upon occasions...

492
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,740
需要你帮  帮忙
you might be requested to assist...

493
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,990
应付些活动
in coping with... some minor event.

494
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,500
你同意吗  
Will that be agreeable?

495
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,510
当然
Of course.

496
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,420
好  您的任务就这些
Yes. And that will be the full extent of your services.

497
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,180
那下周见
Shall I see you next week?

498
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,350
我们要天天见
I shall see you every day.

499
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,600
感觉下巴放松
Feel the loosening of the jaw.

500
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,440
好  来蹦两下  蹦  放松肩膀
Good. Little bounces, bounces. Shoulders loose.

501
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,460
来  甩嘴唇
Now lips.

502
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,220
深吸一口气  扩张胸腔
Take a nice deep breath. Expand your chest..

503
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,000
把手放在肋骨上
put your hands on your ribs.

504
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,200
继续吸  好
Deeper, good.

505
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,760
感觉如何  
How do you feel?

506
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,100
满腹废话
Full of hot air.

507
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,460
演说不就是这样吗
Isn't that what public speaking is all about?

508
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,630
我妻子和我很荣幸来参观如此重要的
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...

509
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,470

Take a good deep breath, and up comes Her Royal Highness

510
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,250
慢慢呼气  把殿下放下
and slowly exhale, and down comes Her Royal Highness.

511
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,840
-博迪你还好吗  -好
- You alright, Bertie? - Yes.

512
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,130
这还挺好玩
This is actually quite good fun.

513
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,310
母... 母亲

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,700
很好
Perfect.

-放松肩膀  -打南边来了个喇嘛
- Loosen the shoulders. - Ding dong bell,

522
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,380
手里提着五斤鳎犸  打北边来了个哑巴
which is in the well... who put any little ton in ten...

523
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,020
还不长记性  博迪  继续
Still short memory, Bertie, come on.

524
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,400
-一头牛  -一头牛

只要能站在窗前掉嗓
Anyone who can shout vows in a open window

527
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,730
就能学会演讲

528
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,980
40秒  50秒
Fourty... fifty!

529
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,400
-深深吸气  -今天
- Take a deep breath, and... - It is...

530
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,500
-然后脱口而出  -狗屁御医都他妈没用
- Let the words flow. - Knight as a bloody wack...

531
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,120
再来一次博迪  加油
Come on. One more time, Bertie, do it!

532
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,860

539
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
等很久了吗
You waiting long?

540
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,000
老天  真他妈冷
Christ, it's bloody freezing.

541

伊丽莎白得了肺炎
Elizabeth has pneumonia.

544
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,140
真可怜  她会康复的
I'm sorry. She'll recover.

545
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,090
父亲就难说了
Father won't.

546
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,270

老家伙这是成心的  
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.

548
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,780
成心要死吗
Dying?

549
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,490
提前离席
Departing prematurely...

550
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,000
恶化和威利斯(辛普森夫人)的关系

551
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,170

For heaven's sake, David. You know how long he's been ill.

552
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,540
威利斯是这么想的
Wallis explained.

553
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,100
她对这种事很明白
She's terribly clever about these things.

554
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,040
1912年6月11日于威斯敏斯特

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,170
上诏加盖国玺
bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June, 1912

556
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,770
乔治五世陛下宣布
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute...

557
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,350
-任命国家议会  -怎么了
- order and declare that there should be a guardian, -What's going on here.

558
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,470
-监国  -我  我没明白  不理解
- Custos Regni... - I cannot follow you. I'm confused that and...

559
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,450
-代天巡守  -我不懂你在说什么
- in the form of council of state. - I don't understand what you are talking about...

560
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,490
阁下  这是有关英国议会的决议
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.

561
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,710
授权我们代您行政
So we may act on your behalf...

562
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,550
说  说清楚点  我
talk clearer to me, I'm afraid...

563
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,930
-我一点都不明白  -通过
- I'm so confused but... - Approved.

564
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,670
谢谢
Thank you.

565
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,500
阁下  请伸手 
Give me your hand, sir.

566
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,530
谢谢
Thank you.

567
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,480
感觉好点吗  阁下 
Feeling a little better, Sir?

568
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,080
没有  不好  太难受了
No. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.

569
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
你滑冰  滑冰去了吗
Been, Uh, ice skating? Ice skating?

570
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
没有  乔治
No, no, George.

571
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,100
是  是  他好着呢
Yes, yes, he's alright, of course.

572
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,400
亲爱的我知道  即使聊再长时间 
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk,

573
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,090
也比不上紧密的拥抱和小酌微醺
is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.

574
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,960
我们也不能小醉了
Nor making our own drowsies either,

575
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,380
因为最近酒会太多
as we've had to do far too often lately.

576
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,690
大卫  来吃晚饭
David, dinner?

577
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,930
我跟威利斯说话呢
I'm on with Wallis!

578
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,990
是博迪  不  不  这无所谓
Bertie. No. No, it's not important.

579
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,630
我不想当国王  真的
I don't want to! No!

580
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,630
晚点打给你  
I'll phone you later.

581
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,040
再见
Bye, bye.

582
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,150
威利斯很想我
Wallis misses me terribly.

583
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,440
妈妈说你晚饭迟到了
Mama says you're late for dinner.

584
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,290
她忘了
She forgets

585
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,690
爸爸的钟都快半小时
Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast.

586
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,680
陛下怎样  他没在痛吧 
How is the King? I hope he is not in pain.

587
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,570
没有  阁下  陛下现在平静多了
No, no, sir. His Majesty is quieter now.

588
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,400
谢谢
Thank you.

589
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,450
大卫  你父王要在场
David, if your father were here,

590
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,210
不会容忍你迟到
tardiness would not be tolerated.

591
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,450
也不会容忍这样不愉快的事情发生
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.

592
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,770
殿下  如您所知  我很欣赏您
You know sir, I appreciate that

593
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,210
您与令尊相比
you are different from your father

594
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,240
目光远大  性格温和
both in outlook and temperament.

595
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,590
我想告诉您
I want you to know that...

596
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,800
只要国王质疑您的行为
whenever the King questioned your conduct,

597
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,950
我都是站在您的立场上
I tried in your interest,

598
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,520
为您的利益着想
to present it in a most favourable light.

599
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,100
我相信您心里时刻想着'国王'的利益
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.

600
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,340
恐怕国王大限将至
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.

601
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,650
各位请慢用
Please continue.

602
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,320
我们将乔治弟兄
We commend our brother George...

603
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,690
交予仁慈的天父  我们的造物主和救赎者
to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.

604
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,390
国王万岁
Long live the King.

605
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,610
我希望  我能做得和他一样好
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.

606
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,820
这到底是谁怎么了
What on earth was that?

607
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,900
可怜的威利斯  这下我陷入困境了
Poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!

608
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,100
来段莎士比亚的戏吧  爸爸
Time for a Shake, dad?

609
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,030
真的要吗
You sure?

610
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,350
来吧
Go on.

611
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,990
准备好猜谜
Put your thinking caps on.

612
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,470
我猜是《麦克白》
Bet its the Scottish Play.

613
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,840
不对  肯定《奥赛罗》  总是《奥赛罗》
No, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.

614
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,350
害怕吗  
Are thou afeard.

615
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,680
不要怕
Be not afeard.

616
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,510
凯列班[莎士比亚剧《暴风雨》中角色]
Caliban!

617
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,510
老天  肯定是蒙对的
Oh! For heaven's sake... that was a lucky guess!

618
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,910
别听那书呆子的  继续  爸爸
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

619
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,070
岛上回响着各种声音  空气宜人
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs,

620
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,680
讨人喜欢  没有伤害
that give delight, and hurt not.

621
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,020
有时无数叮咚乐器声
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments...

622
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,440
在我耳边鸣响
will hum about mine ears,

623
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,640
有时我酣睡醒来
and sometimes voices, that, if then...

624
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,200
听见歌声  又使我沉沉睡去
I had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again.

625
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,900
好了  小机灵鬼  下一句是什么
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?

626
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,800
于是在梦里  我以为云要散了
And then, in dreaming, the clouds methought would open,

627
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,220
昭示财富将临  醒来之后
and show riches ready to drop upon me...

628
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,660
醒来之后  我含泪重又入梦
that when I'm awaked, I cried to dream again.

629
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,510
这可真悲痛
It's such a sad thought.

630
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,680
肯定是我的下一个病人来早了
My next patient must be early.

631
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,830
你们得走了  小伙子们  对不起
You better go lads, I'm sorry.

632
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,830
马上来  克利福德
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

633
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,600
博迪  
Bertie!

634
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,210
他们告诉我说你不来了
They told me not to expect you.

635
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,390
节哀顺变
I am sorry about your father.

636
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,640
希望没有打扰您
I don't wish to intrude.

637
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,300
没有没有  请进
Oh no... Please come in.

638
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,650
我一直在练习  无论如何每天练一小时
I've been practising. One hour a day. In spite of everything.

639
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,870
你那儿怎么了
What's going on there?

640
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,280
不好意思  我在跟孩子们胡闹
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.

641
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,740
你今天想进行练习吗
Do you feel like working today?

642
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,110
柯蒂斯双翼飞机
A Curtis bi-plane.

643
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,060
我来准备点热牛奶
I'll put on some hot milk.

644
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,370
罗格  我喝点刺激的
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.

645
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,400
我父亲临终前我不在 
I wasn't there for my father's death.

646
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,500
这让我抱憾至今
Still makes me sad.

647
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,300
我可以想象
I can imagine so.

648
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,710
你父亲是干什么的
What did you father do?

649
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,300
他是个酿酒的
He was a brewer.

650
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,330
至少喝酒不要钱
At least there was free beer.

651
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,390
这杯来缅怀您父亲
Here's to the memory of your father.

652
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,310
后来  他们告诉我
I was informed, after the fact...

653
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,710
我父亲的临终遗言是
that my father's last words were,

654
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,610
博迪比其他几个兄弟加一起更勇敢
Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.

655
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,170
他没能直接对我说
He couldn't say that to my face.

656
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,030
我哥哥
My brother.

657
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,710
他怎么了
What about him?

658
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,820
试着唱出来
Try singing it.

659
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,140
什么
I'm sorry.

660
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,690
你会唱什么歌
What songs do you know?

661
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,400
唱歌
Songs?

662
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,440
对  唱歌
Yes, songs.

663
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,640
《史瓦尼河》
"Swanee River"?

664
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,730
我喜欢那首歌
I love that song.

665
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,190
刚好也是我的最爱
Happens to be my favorite.

666
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,340
给我唱唱副歌部分
Sing me the chorus.

667
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,300
不  当然不行
No. Certainly not.

668
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,350
我以前总想做模型  
Always wanted to build models.

669
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,810
父亲不让
Father... father wouldn't allow it.

670
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,190
他集邮  所以我们都得跟着集邮
He collected stamps. So we had to collect stamps.

671
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,960
如果您唱歌  就可以把这个做完  
You can finish that off. If you sing.

672
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,240
我哥哥大卫  笨  笨  笨瓜
My brother David. Dum, dum, dum-dum...

673
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,070
我可不想在这瞎哼哼
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.

674
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,420
你可以跟着我唱
You can with me.

675
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,660
因为你是个怪人
Because you're peculiar.

676
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,310
我就当你在夸我
I take that as a compliment.

677
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,570
按规矩来
Rules are rules.

678
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:29,080
我才不哼《史瓦尼河》
I'm not crooning "Swanee River".

679
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,170
那唱《康城赛马》
"Camptown Races" then.

680
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,870
我哥哥大卫告诉我  嘟哒
My brother David, he said to me, doo-dah

681
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,870
嘟哒  持续发音可以让您说话流利 
doo-dah... Continuous sound will give you flow.

682
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,070
现在大卫当国王了  会不会感觉很奇怪
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?

683
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,490
说实话
To tell the truth,

684
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,910
这是种解脱
it was a relief...

685
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,660
知道自己当不了国王
knowing I wouldn't be... King.

686
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:05,720
可除非他有孩子  否则您就是下一任
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.

687
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,610
然后是您的女儿伊丽莎白继任
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.

688
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,500
医生啊医生  你是在胡说
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.

689
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,270
叫我莱昂内尔  看  你不结巴了
Lionel See? You didn'stammer.

690
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,190
我当然不结巴  我在唱歌
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!

691
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,250
作为奖励
Well, as a little reward,

692
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,150
您可以在支架上抹点胶水
you get to put some glue on these struts.

693
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,330
你儿子不会介意吧
Your boy, won't mind?

694
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,240
不  完全不会
No, not at all.

695
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,500
大卫和我曾经很亲密  
David and I were very close.

696
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:48,420
你知道  年轻人嘛
Young bucks... You know.

697
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,950
你们追一个姑娘
Did you chase the same girls?

698
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:01,690
安排引见的时候大卫总是很帮得上忙
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.

699
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:10,660
我们都受到了巴黎的波莱特无微不至的照顾
We shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.

700
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,020
当然不是同一个时候
Not at the same time of course.

701
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,820
大卫嘲笑过你吗
Did David ever tease you?

702
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,030
他们都嘲笑过  博-博-博-博迪
Yes, they all did. Buh-buh-buh-Bertie?

703
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,270
父亲纵容他们
Father encouraged it.

704
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,050
说"别紧张  孩子"  说这样能让我不结巴
Said,"Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.

705
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,300
他说"我害怕我父亲
Said that "I sas afraid of my father,

706
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,960
我的孩子必须也得怕我"
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."

707
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,110
你天生就是右撇子吗
Are you naturally right handed?

708
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:57,870
左撇子  我被迫改过来的  现在我习惯右手了
Left. I was... punished. Now I use the right.

709
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,480
没错  这种情况在结巴中很常见
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.

710
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,930
还做过别的矫正吗
Anything other corrections?

711
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,040
X型腿
Knock knees.

712
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,450
整天都得戴着金属夹板
Metal splints were made. Worn... worn day and night.

713
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,940
-那一定很疼  -疼死了
- That must have been painful. - Bloody agony.

714
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,290
现在腿直了
Straight legs now.

715
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,310
你同哪个家人最亲近
Who were you closest to in your family?

716
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,000
乳母们  不是第一个  
Nannies. Not my first nanny.

717
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,090
她喜欢大卫  讨厌我
She loved David... hated me.

718
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,400
我们被带去
When we are presented to my...

719
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,440
觐见父母的时候  
parents for the daily viewing,

720
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:45,950
她会掐我
she'd pinch me..

721
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:50,220
我就哭  然后被立刻交回给她
I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.

722
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,110
然后  她就
And then she would...

723
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,470
唱出来
Sing it.

724
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:08,310
"然后她就不喂我"
"Then she wouldn't feed me. Far far away."

725
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,500
三年之后我父母才发现
Took my parents... three years to notice.

726
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,060
胃会出毛病一点都不奇怪  直到现在
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.

727
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,420
你弟弟约翰尼呢
What about your brother, Johnny?

728
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,980
你和他亲近吗
Were you close to him?

729
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,780
约翰尼  
Johnny.

730
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,400
好孩子
Sweet boy.

731
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,000
得了...
Had...

732
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,910
得了癫痫
epilepsy.

733
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:55,310
他不一样
And he was... different.

734
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:01,040
13岁就去世了  
He died at... 13.

735
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,210
不曾在公开场合出现
hidden from view.

736
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,970
他们告诉我这病不传染
I'm... I'm told it's not... catching.

737
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,900
再来一杯吗
Do you want a top-up?

738
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,490
谢谢
Please.

739
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,730
你知道吗
You know...

740
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,300
莱昂内尔  你是...
Lionel, you're...

741
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,350
你是英国平民中第一个...
you're the first ordinary Englishman...

742
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,200
澳大利亚平民
Australian.

743
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,200
(英国平民中第一个)同我真正交谈的
I've ever really spoken to.

744
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,830
当我坐在车里穿过街道时
When I'm... driven through the streets and see the,

745
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,350
看见那些平民注视着我
you know, the common man staring at me,

746
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,530
我总为我对他的生活一无所知
I'm struck by how little I know of his life,

747
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,500
和他对我的生活一无所知而感到震惊
and how little he knows of mine.

748
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,600
谢谢
Thank you.

749
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,160
朋友就是倾诉对象
What're friends for.

750
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,940
我本来不会明白
I wouldn't know.

751
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,400
苏格兰 巴尔莫勒尔堡

752
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:13,620
我用一个结实的大筛子...  筛了七个粗茎蓟草
I sifted seven... thick-stalked thistles trough a strong, thick sieve.

753
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,400
我筛了七个粗茎蓟草  
I sifted seven thick-stalked...

754
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,800
可以了  亲爱的
That's enough now, darling.

755
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,500
说的差劲  我得接着练
I have to keep doing this, it's awful.

756
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,400
-我筛了七个粗茎蓟草  -不会吧
I sifted seven... thick-stalked... - Oh, no.

757
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,020
百年的云杉  为了开阔视野就这么砍了
One hundred year old spruces... removed to improve the view!

758
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,560
她以为她是谁
Who does she think she is!

759
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,900
不管怎样  我们必须对辛普森夫人尽量亲切友好一些
Nonetheless... we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.

760
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,670
你知道她管我叫"苏格兰胖厨子"吗
You know she calls me the Fat Scottish Cook?

761
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,770
你又不胖
You're not fat.

762
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,280
我快要发福了
I'm getting plump.

763
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,130
你不下厨
You seldom cook.

764
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,530
-我筛了七个...  -闭嘴
I sifted seven... - Shut up!

765
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,800
结实的大筛子...  粗茎蓟草
trough a strong... thick sieves...

766
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,800
再次说反 ||

767
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,800
我筛了七个...
I sifted seven...

768
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,410
约克郡公爵与公爵夫人殿下驾到
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.

769
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,450
见到你们俩真高兴
How lovely to see you both.

770
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,900
欢迎来到我们的乡间小屋
Welcome to our little country shack.

771
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,730
国王邀请我才来的
I came at the invitation of the King.

772
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,510
国王陛下
Your Majesty.

773
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,710
-路上顺利吗  -抱歉我们来晚了  
- You all right? - Sorry we're late.

774
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,380
很高兴见到你  
Very nice to see you.

775
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,900
辛普森夫人
Mrs. Simpson.

776
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,640
很高兴
Very nice.

777
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,260
大卫
Hello David.

778
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,910
我发现你在...  改造花园
Making some... changes to the garden, I see.

779
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,810
对  还没弄完 
Yes, I am not quite finished yet.

780
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,570
别告诉我我表现不礼貌  丘吉尔先生
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.

781
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:58,250
恰恰相反  殿下  礼仪规定
On the contrary, your Royal Highness. Etiquette decrees

782
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,320
皇室成员应当被正式主人接待  
royalty must be greeted by the official host,

783
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,260
在此  就应该是国王  而不是平民
in this case, the King. Not a commoner.

784
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,160
谢谢
Thank you.

785
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,600
她是怎么迷住他的
What is her hold on him?

786
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,080
不知道
I have no idea.

787
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,900
显然她在上海国教教会
Apparently she has certain skills...

788
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,600
学会了某些技巧
acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.

789
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,490
大卫  
David.

790
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,000
马上  亲爱的  失陪一下
Just be a sec, darling. Would you excuse me?

791
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,260
大卫  我一直想见你
David, I've been trying to see you...

792
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,030
我忙得焦头烂额
I've been terribly busy.

793
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,500
忙什么
Doing what?

794
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,020
-当国王  -真的吗
- Kinging. - Really?

795
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:54,130
如今当国王如履薄冰
Kinging... is a precarious business these days.

796
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,020
俄罗斯的沙皇何在  德国的威廉皇帝何在
Where is the Russian Tsar? Where is Cousin Wilhelm?

797
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,620
你可真没趣
You're being dreary.

798
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:03,180
难道当国王要把桑德林汉姆夏宫80个臣属革职
Is Kinging laying off 80... staff

799
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,460
给威利斯买更多的珍珠
and buying more pearls for Wallis

800
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,210
而此时共产主义者已席卷了整个欧洲大陆
while people are marching across Europe singing the Red Flag?

801
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,270
你别操心了  希特勒先生会解决这些问题
Stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort them out.

802
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,920
那谁来解决希特勒先生
And who'll sort out Herr Hitler?

803
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,510
那瓶该死的二三年陈酿在哪
Where's the bloody '23?

804
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,620
你甚至让那女人住进妈妈的套房
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?

805
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,470
妈妈不再睡床了  不是吗
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?

806
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,700
这不好笑
That's not funny.

807
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,300
就是这个  威利斯只喜欢最好的
Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.

808
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,440
我不关心你晚上跟哪个女人暧昧
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night,

809
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:26,420
只要你白天履行身为国王的职责
as long as you show up for duty in the morning!

810
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,830
威利斯不只是跟我暧昧
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.

811
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,300
我们准备结婚了
We intend to marry.

812
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,310
你说什么
Excuse me?

813
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,700
她正在申请离婚
She's filing a petition for divorce.

814
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,790
老天
Good God.

815
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,520
你就不能给她间好房子  再给她封个爵位吗
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?

816
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,940
我不会让她做我的情妇的
I'm not having her as my mistress.

817
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,500
教会不允许离婚
The Church doesn't recognize divorce,

818
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,180
而你正是...  教会的领袖
and you are the... head of the Church.

819
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,440
我难道一点权利也没有吗
Haven't I any rights?

820
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,670
你有很多特权
Many privileges...

821
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,010
不是一回事
Not the same thing.

822
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,790
平民都能为了爱情结婚
Your beloved common man may marry for love,

823
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,800
我怎么就不行
why not me?

824
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,380
你要是...  一个平民
If you were... a common man,

825
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,600
又凭什么加冕为王
on what basis could you... possibly claim to be King?

826
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,370
听起来你对我们这悲惨的宪法很有研究
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.

827
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,260
听起来你没研究
Sounds like you haven't.

828
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,850
这就是你的目的吗
That's what this is about.

829
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:11,370
从演讲课开始  反复练习
Brushing up. Hence, the elocution lessons?

830
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,700
这可是镇上的奇闻
That's the scoop around town.

831
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,240
我是想
I'm trying to...

832
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,820
想再多些听众吗  博  博  博  博  博迪
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-B-B-B-Bertie?

833
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,000
别
Don't...

834
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,300
别什么
What's that?

835
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
抱歉  我...
I'm sorry, I...

836
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,520
弟弟想把哥哥赶下王位
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne..

837
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,350
还  还  还  还  还真老套
P-P-P-P-Positively medieval.

838
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,400
威利斯
Wallis.

839
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,700
你上哪儿去了  
Ah. Where have you been all this time?

840
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,100
-你跟谁聊天呢  -不要你管
- Who have you been talking to? - Never you mind.

841
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:53,700
你究竟是怎样一个让人难以揣摩的国王呢
What a very complicated little King you are.

842
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,700
你喜欢就好
I try to be.

843
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,550
所有的努力都付之东流
All that work... down the drain.

844
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,940
我亲生的哥哥
My own brother...

845
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,800
我居然对着他一个字都说不出来
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.

846
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,690
为什么你跟大卫说话比跟我说话结巴得多
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?

847
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,850
因为你收了一大笔钱听我说话
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!

848
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,690
博迪  我可不是陪聊的艺伎
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.

849
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,750
别说俏皮话了
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!

850
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,000
大卫怎么会让你说不出话
What is it about David that stops you speaking?

851
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,110
你是怎么回事  他妈成天
What is it about you that bloody well makes...

852
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,320
没完没了纠结这个问题
you want to go on about him, the whole bloody time.

853
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,020
粗鄙  但很流利  你骂人的时候从不结巴
Vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.

854
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,820
滚蛋
Bugger off!

855
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,520
你只会骂这个吗
Is that the best you can do?

856
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,160
去你妈的  你这禽兽不如的混蛋
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

857
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,420
公共学校的道学先生都比你会骂人
A public school prig can do better than that.

858
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,440
日
Shit!

859
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,400
日  日  日
Shit, shit, shit.

860
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,400
日  日  日  日  日  日  日
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

861
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,000
-日  日  -这就对了
Shit! Shit! - Yes!

862
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,810
看脏话从舌尖喷涌而出
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?

863
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,840
因为我怒了
Because I'm angry!

864
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,000
你会说那个F开头的词吗
You Know the f-word?

865
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,200
通奸
Fornication?

866
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,350
博迪  别装
Oh Bertie.

867
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,900
操  
Fuck.

868
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,060
操  操  操  操它的操
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking fuck!

869
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,320
操  操且兽性大发
Fuck, fuck and bugger!

870
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,010
鸡奸  兽奸  
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, buggedy.

871
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,570
鸡奸  操  操  菊花

Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.

874
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,480
爸   
Dad? What's going on?

875
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,870
抱歉  做作业去
Sorry. Finish your homework

876
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,800
我们很少见到你这一面
Well...That's a side of you we don't get to see that often.

877
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,000
我们不该这样的  不能公开这样
No. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.

878
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,560
出去透透气吧
Let's get some air.

879
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,200
不  罗格  我不认为这是个好主意
No, Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.

880
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,700
怎么了  什么让你这么沮丧
What's the matter? What's got you so upset?

881
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,560
罗格  你都想不到
Logue, you have no idea.

882
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:49,710
我哥哥迷恋一个结过两次婚的女人
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.

883
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:54,160
她正在申请离婚  而大卫决定要娶她
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.

884
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:59,880
巴尔的摩的威利斯・辛普森夫人
Mrs. Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.

885
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,070
不对  以后就是巴尔的摩的威利斯皇后
That's not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?

886
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,040
难以想象
Unthinkable.

887
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,770
他能这么做吗
Can he do that?

888
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:10,500
当然不能  但他决意如此
Absolutely not. But he's going to anyway.

889
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,260
所有事情全乱套了
All hell's broken loose.

890
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,480
他们不能偷偷的继续吗
Can't they carry on privately?

891
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,870
要是他们愿意就好了
If only they would.

892
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,510
你的立场是什么
Where does that leave you?

893
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,450
我知道我的本份
I know my place.

894
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,000
我会尽我一切所能
I'll do anything...

895
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,800
让我哥哥继续留在王位上
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.

896
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,560
你是认真的
Is it that serious?

897
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,000
也许做国王是你的本份
Your place may well be on the throne.

898
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,820
我不是我哥哥的替代者
I am not an alternative to my brother.

899
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,390
如果你是国王  你会做的比大卫更好
You can outshine David.

900
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,090
别乱说
Don't take liberties!

901
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,370
这近乎叛国
That's bordering on treason.

902
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,340
我只是说你可以做国王  你能做到
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!

903
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,790
这是叛国
That is treason!

904
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,800
我只是想让你明白
I'm trying to get you to realise...

905
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,190
-你不用被恐惧控制  -够了
- you need not be governed by fear. - I've had enough of this!

906
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,940
你到底在怕什么
What're you so afraid of?

907
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,030
你这些讨厌的话
Your poisonous words!

908
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,680
那你为什么来找我
Why'd you come to me?

909
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,440
你可不是什么中产阶级人士
You are not some middle class bugger,

910
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,780
上了演讲课去跟别人胡扯
who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...

911
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:04,680
别对我的事指手画脚
Don't instruct me on my duties!

912
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,990
我是国王的儿子
I'm the son of a.... King.

913
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,570
国王的弟弟
The brother of a king.

914
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,090
你只是酿酒师没出息的儿子
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!

915
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,700
一个澳洲乡下来的暴发户
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!

916
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,250
你什么都不是
You're nobody.

917
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,800
疗程结束
These sessions are over!

918
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,000
花园入口

919
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,000
首相办公室

920
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,000
唐宁街十号

921
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,860
不是因为她是美国人  那不算什么
It's not because she's an American. That is the least of it.

922
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,300
是因为她是一个就要离婚两次的美国人
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American,

923
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,820
而国王作为英国国教的最高领袖
And the King, as head of The Church of England...

924
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,700
不能娶一个离过婚的女人
can not marry a divorced woman.

925
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,940
阁下  我对此感到遗憾
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this.

926
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,800
根据苏格兰场的调查
According to Scotland Yard,

927
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:41,820
国王并不是辛普森夫人唯一的爱人
the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's favours and affections,

928
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,620
她另有一个情人  是个二手汽车商人  
sharing them with a married used car salesman,

929
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,800
名叫盖伊・特兰德尔
a certain Mr Guy Trundle.

930
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,680
而且  还有传言说
In addition, it is also rumoured...

931
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,450
希特勒的大使  坎特・冯・李宾特洛普
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop,

932
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,400
每天给她送十七支康乃馨
sends her 17 carnations every day.

933
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:04,220
如果你哥哥继续无视内阁的忠告
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government,

934
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,320
他必须退位
he must abdicate.

935
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:10,000
否则内阁别无选择  只能辞职
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.

936
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,010
首相
Prime Minister,

937
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:16,690
你要让这个国家没有内阁
you'd leave the country without a... a government?

938
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,340
一个国王该做他想做的
Does the King do what he wants,

939
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,540
还是该做他的人民想让他做的
or does he do what his people expect him to do?

940
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,520
怎么了  亲爱的
What's the matter, love?

941
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,120
我只是为一个病人苦恼
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.

942
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:42,300
这可不像你  为什么苦恼
That isn't like you.. Why?

943
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,560
他很害怕  
He's scared...

944
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,900
害怕他自己的影子
H's afraid of his own shadow.

945
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,920
他们不就是为了这个来找你吗
Isn't that why they come to you?

946
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:56,280
这个人真的可以很优秀
This fellow could be really somebody great,

947
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,700
但他反对我的说法
and he's fighting me.

948
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,620
可能他不想成为优秀的人
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.

949
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,450
也许是你一厢情愿
Perhaps that's what you want.

950
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,980
我可能有点过分了
I might have overstepped the mark.

951
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,740
去道歉
Apologize,

952
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,230
对你们俩都好
do you both good.

953
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,430
很抱歉  罗格先生  公爵大人很忙
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.

954
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,200
我可以等  或者晚点再来
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.

955
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,730
我说了  公爵大人非常忙
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

956
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,020
谢谢
Thank you.

957
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,030
议会不会支持这桩婚姻的
The parliament will not support their marriage.

958
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,260
但还有其他顾虑  阁下 
But there were other reasons for concern.

959
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,760
他不关心国家政策
He was careless with state papers.

960
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,320
他不承担义务  缺少决心
He lacked commitment and resolve.

961
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:17,060
还有人担心
There were those that worried

962
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,970
如果同德国开战  他是什么立场
where he would stand when war comes with Germany .

963
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,450
我们不会走到那一步吧
We're not coming to that?

964
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,410
绝对会  阁下 
Indeed we are, Sir.

965
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,010
鲍德温首相也许会否认这点
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,

966
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,500
但希特勒的野心昭然若揭
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

967
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,290
与德国大战在即
War with Germany will come,

968
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:39,000
而我们需要一个带领我们团结一致的国王
and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand behind, united.

969
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,150
我担心  此时我哥哥
I fear my... brother is not of...

970
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,520
还没有看清形势
sound mind, at this time.

971
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,850
你想过赋予自己什么头衔吗
Have you thought what you will call yourself?

972
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:01,860
当然不能是阿尔伯特  阁下  太德国化了
Certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.

973
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,290
乔治怎么样
What about George?

974
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,540
用你父亲的头衔  
After your father?

975
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,620
乔治六世
George the sixth.

976
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,050
是个不错的传承  
It has rather a nice continuity to it,

977
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,180
你不觉得吗
don't you think?

978
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,780
大卫  谢天谢地
David! Thank God.

979
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:29,700
你看起来很累坏了
You look exhausted!

980
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,800
你还撑得住吗
How are you bearing up?

981
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,400
博迪  我已经决定了
Bertie. The decision's been made, I...

982
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,700
我要退位
I am going.

983
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,340
我无法接受
I cannot accept that.

984
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,890
你无论如何都不该做此决定
You are in no condition to make that decision.

985
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:44,820
恐怕没有别的办法
I'm afraid there's no other way.

986
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,300
我要娶她
I must marry her.

987
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,590
我已经决定了  抱歉
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

988
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,300
真是个糟糕的消息
That's a terrible thing to hear.

989
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:06,000
大卫  没人想你这么做  特别是我
David, nobody wants that. I least of all.

990
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:18,600
终于  我可以说点自己的话
"At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.

991
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:23,750
我于1936年12月10日签字证明

992
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:23,750
爱德华签署于景观台城堡

993
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,090
我从来没有想要隐瞒什么  
I have never wanted to withhold anything,

994
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,900
但在此之前
but until now,

995
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,200
根据宪法我不能发表任何讲话
it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.

996
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:33,380
几个小时之前  我卸下了
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty...

997
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,400
作为一个国王和君主最后职责
as King and Emperor.

998
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,460
现在  将由我的弟弟约克公爵继位
And now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York

999
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,730
首先我表明对他效忠
my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.

1000
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,400
全心全意忠顺
This I do with all my heart.

1001
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,270
相信你们都知道
You all know the reasons

1002
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,960
我宣布放弃王位的原因
which have impelled me to renounce the throne.

1003
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,540
但是请你们相信我接下来的话
But you must believe me, when I tell you

1004
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,340
如果没有我心爱女人的支持
I have found it impossible to carry the

1005
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:10,040
我无法承担如此重任
heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..

1006
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,860
也无法如我所愿的
as King as I would wish to do...

1007
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,610
卸除作为国王的职责
without the help and support of the woman I love.

1008
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,070
同时  我希望你们知道
And I want you to know.

1009
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,310
出于对我弟弟的了解
This decision has been made less difficult to me...

1010
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,880
这个决定做的并不艰难
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

1011
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,400
我弟弟一直致力于国家事务管理
with his long training in the public affairs of this country...

1012
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,930
加上他的优秀品质
and with his fine qualities...

1013
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,990
必然能够即刻继位
will be able to take my place forth with...

1014
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,590
不会让国家的前途和发展
without interruption or injury...

1015
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,740
受到任何的阻碍或伤害
to the life and progress of the empire."

1016
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,340
登基会议

1017
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,340
圣詹姆斯宫

1018
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,340
1936年12月21日

1019
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,030
我  在今天
I meet you at today...

1020
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,300
在此情况下  和你们会面
in circumstances which are...

1021
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:34,240
我保证你们会喜欢的
I'm sure you will love it.

1022
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:37,070
谢谢宝贝  马鞍给我  玛格丽特
Thank you darling, saddles, Margret.

1023
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,840
-好的  妈妈  -乖孩子
- Yes mom. - Good boy.

1024
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,990
-妈妈这是威尔逊马鞍  -谢谢你
- Mama, here’s the Wilson saddle - Thank you.

1025
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,510
别担心  我们一会就喂你吃东西
Don’t worry, we’ll get you food in a minute

1026
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,300
妈妈  新家里有地方放小马吗
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?

1027
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,700
当然有  小宝贝  宫殿里有很多房间 
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.

1028
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:03,940
屈膝礼
Curtsey.

1029
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,620
陛下
Your Majesty.

1030
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,580
登基怎么样
How was it?

1031
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:45,750
我在努力熟悉公文
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.

1032
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,830
鲍德温先生来的信件  我一个字都没看懂
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.

1033
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,860
大卫的财务状况
David's finances.

1034
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,730
圣诞演说
The Christmas... broadcast.

1035
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:11,930
我觉得这是个错误
I think that might be a mistake.

1036
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:12,930
别担心了
Don't worry about that.

1037
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,020
还有加冕典礼计划
Plans for the Coronation

1038
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,670
这或许是个更大的错误
I think that's an even bigger mistake.

1039
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,780
我不是国王
I'm not a King.

1040
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,760
我是海军军官  只知道怎么做海军军官
I'm a naval officer. That's all I know.

1041
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:46,430
我不属于这里  我不是国王
I'm not here. I'm not a King.

1042
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

1043
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

1044
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,270
别  别这样
Please, please.

1045
01:15:57,330 --> 01:16:00,770
亲爱的  亲爱的
Oh, dear. Dear, dear man.

1046
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,280
你知道吗  
You know...

1047
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,930
我两次拒绝你的求婚
I refused your first two marriage proposals,

1048
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,120
不是因为我不爱你
not because I didn't love you,

1049
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,600
而是因为我不能忍受皇室的生活
but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.

1050
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,020
不能忍受四处出访和公共责任
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties,

1051
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:24,240
生活不再属于我们自己
a life that no longer was really to be my own.

1052
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,740
不过后来我想
But then I thought...

1053
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,460
他是结巴太好了
he stammers so beautifully...

1054
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,250
大家会放过我们
they'll leave us alone.

1055
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:38,670
支持国王  上帝保佑他

1056
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,150
等国王来道歉  那要等很久
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.

1057
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,410
恐怕我们迟到了一会
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

1058
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,540
这就是我家  
This is home.

1059
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,280
莫特尔去打桥牌了
Myrtle's at bridge.

1060
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,700
我让孩子们都出去
I've made sure the boys are out.

1061
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,180
太好了
It's lovely.

1062
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,750
非常好
Absolutely lovely.

1063
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,630
我能坐这吗
May I sit down?

1064
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:23,890
当然可以
Yes, of course.

1065
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,820
喝点茶吧  夫人
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?

1066
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,500
好的  我自己来就行
Yes. I'll help myself.

1067
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,930
你们聊吧
Off you go...

1068
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,060
还是需要我强迫你们
Or must I knock your heads together?

1069
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,370
这是我欠你的一先令
Here's your shilling,

1070
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,920
我  我明白
I... I understand...

1071
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,000
你之前的意思了  罗格
what you were trying to say, Logue.

1072
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,900
我做错了
I went about it the wrong way.

1073
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,690
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1074
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,410
所以  我来了
So, here I am.

1075
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,660
全国准备好
Is the nation ready for two...

1076
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:11,980
听我的两分钟无声广播了吗
minutes of radio silence?

1077
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:15,380
所有结巴都害怕自己又回到原点
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.

1078
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,440
我不会让这个情况发生的
I don't let that happen.

1079
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:20,160
如果我做的不好
If I fail in my duty...

1080
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:22,710
大卫就会回来
David could come back.

1081
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,460
我看到那些布告了
I've seen the placard.

1082
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,500
天佑吾王
"God save our... King."

1083
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,010
他们指的不是我
They don't mean me.

1084
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:35,810
历史上每一位君主的继任
Every other monarch in history

1085
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,600
都是在前任去世或者命不久矣的情况下
succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.

1086
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:50,630
而我的前任不仅活着  还活得很好
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.

1087
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,890
真是一团糟
What a bloody mess!

1088
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,530
我甚至不能发表一次圣诞演说
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.

1089
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,230
像您父亲曾经那样
Like your Dad used to do?

1090
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,620
没错
Precisely.

1091
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,900
他已经不在了
He's not here anymore.

1092
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,820
不  他还在  就在我给你的一先令上
Yes he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.

1093
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,130
随便都能送人
Easy enough to give away.

1094
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:18,030
您不用总带着他的影子
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.

1095
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:20,470
或者你哥哥的影子
Or your brother.

1096
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,420
您无需害怕那些
You don't need to be afraid of

1097
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,400
您五岁时候害怕的东西
the things as you were afraid of when you were five.

1098
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,000
您已经独立自主  博迪
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

1099
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,430
是吗
Am I?

1100
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,000
你的脸会印在下一批硬币上  哥们
Your face is next, mate.

1101
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:45,400
莱昂纳尔
Lionel?

1102
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,580
莫特尔
Myrtle!

1103
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:50,030
-没事吧  -没事
- Is it alright? - Yes.

1104
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,630
博迪  过来
Bertie, come here.

1105
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,160
-你还好吧  罗格  -还好
- Are you alright, Logue? - Yes.

1106
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:02,980
-要出去吗  -相信我  这很重要
- Shall we go through? - Trust me. It's important.

1107
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,660
怎么了
What is it?

1108
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,350
-陛  陛  -第一次叫陛下就好
- Your... Your... - It's your Majesty? The first time.

1109
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,350
之后可以叫夫人  别读错了
After that, it's Ma'am. As in Ham, not Malm as in Palm.

1110
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,930
我没跟她讲过我们的事
I haven't told her about us.

1111
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,080
先坐下  放松
Sit down, relax.

1112
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:24,050
你丈夫叫我丈夫博迪
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie

1113
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,090
而我丈夫叫你丈夫莱昂纳尔
and my husband calls your husband Lionel.

1114
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,240
我想你应该不会叫我莉斯
I trust you won't call me Liz.

1115
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:33,090
陛下  你可以叫我罗格夫人
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.

1116
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,180
见到你很高兴  罗格夫人
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.

1117
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,520
罗格  我们不能一直站这
Logue, we can't stand here all day.

1118
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,520
我们可以的  我得等个合适的时候
Yes we can. Look, I need to wait for the right moment.

1119
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,040
罗格你这样像胆小鬼
Logue, you're being a coward!

1120
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,720
你说的没错
You're damn right.

1121
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,450
出去吧  伙计
Get out there, man!

1122
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,500
嗨  亲爱的莫特尔
Hello, Myrtle darling!

1123
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,960
你回来早了  
You're early.

1124
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,230
我相信你们已经见过面了
I believe you two have met!

1125
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:58,870
但是  我想你应该还没见过
But I didn't think, you know...

1126
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:02,000
国王乔治六世
King George the Sixth.

1127
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,760
很高兴见到你
It's very nice to meet you.

1128
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,650
陛下们要留下吃晚饭吗
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?

1129
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,650
我们也想留下来  谢谢你的好意
We would love to, such a treat, but alas...

1130
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,660
但是有约在身  真遗憾
a previous engagement. What a pitty.

1131
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:37,380
-主教大人  -欢迎您  陛下
- Archbishop. - Welcome, your Majesty.

1132
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:41,230
多么壮观的改造  阁下
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.

1133
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,260
请允许我们继续准备
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.

1134
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:51,760
现在请允许我为您介绍仪式的过程
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.

1135
01:21:56,180 --> 01:22:00,730
我们从西门进来  然后到中殿
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.

1136
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:03,880
我听说您所有讲话
I see you all your

1137
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,660
都会被广播  主教大人
pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1138
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:11,960
是的  无线电就像潘多拉的盒子
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.

1139
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:16,280
我恐怕还得批准新闻摄影的拍摄
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.

1140
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:19,800
我会亲自监督剪辑的
The product of which I shall personally edit.

1141
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,490
真是毫不犹豫
Without momentary hesitation.

1142
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:27,410
这是哈里大街的罗格医生
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.

1143
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:29,530
他是我的语言治疗师
He's my speech therapist.

1144
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,640
-大人  -如果知道
- Your Grace. - Had I known

1145
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,890
陛下您在寻医
that Your Majesty was seeking assistance

1146
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,490
我一定会亲自给您推荐人选的
I should've made my own recommendation.

1147
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,200
罗格医生
Dr. Logue...

1148
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,120
会  会出席加冕礼
will be attending the Coronation.

1149
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,880
我可以去跟教长说一下
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean,

1150
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,680
但会很困难
but it was extremely difficult.

1151
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:55,250
我想让他坐到国王的包厢里
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.

1152
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,780
但那是给您的家人准备的  阁下
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.

1153
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,730
这正是那里合适的原因
That is why it's suitable.

1154
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:05,040
大人如果你不介意的话
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace,

1155
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:05,940
我们需要场地准备
we need the premises.

1156
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:08,520
老兄  这可是威斯敏斯特教堂
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!

1157
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,680
教堂必须为陛下准备
The Church must prepare his Majesty.

1158
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:13,520
我的准备也一样重要
My preparations are equalized in important

1159
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:20,720
如果你不介意的话  最好清场
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.

1160
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,700
我也希望这样  大人
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1161
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:29,650
今晚教堂就交由陛下使用
I shall place the Abbey at Your majesty's disposal...

1162
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:32,980
容我告退  陛下
this evening. Your Majesty.

1163
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,480
我不敢相信我正走在
I can't believe I'm walking on...

1164
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,840
乔叟  韩德尔和狄更斯的墓上
Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1165
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:13,470
准备好了吗  我们开始吧
Everything alright? Let's get cracking.

1166
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:19,040
我不是来这彩排的  罗格医生
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.

1167
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:23,710
叫我莱昂纳尔
Call me Lionel.

1168
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:31,130
是啊  你一直  都不管自己叫医生
True, you... never... called yourself "Doctor".

1169
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:35,570
是我这么叫你
I did that... for you.

1170
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:47,940
没有培训  没有文凭  没有资质
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.

1171
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,350
只有一身的胆量
Just a... great deal of nerve.

1172
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,060
这是秘密审问吗
The star chamber inquisition, is it?

1173
01:24:56,110 --> 01:25:01,520
你要求信任  和充分的平等
You asked trust. And... total equality.

1174
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:04,430
博迪  我听了你在温布利的演讲
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.

1175
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,630
我当时在场
I was there.

1176
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:08,370
我的儿子劳里说  爸爸
My son Laurie said dad,

1177
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,980
你能不能帮帮这个可怜人
do you think you could help that poor man?

1178
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,180
怎么帮  就凭一个失败的演员
What, as a failed actor!?

1179
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:15,290
这是事实  我不是一个医生
It's true, I'm not a doctor,

1180
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:18,000
而且  我确实当过一阵演员
and yes I acted a bit,

1181
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:23,230
我在俱乐部朗诵  在学校教演讲
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.

1182
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,350
当大战来临
When the Great War came,

1183
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,780
我们的士兵从前线回来
all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front,

1184
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,320
很多人得了炮弹休克症
a lot of them shell-shocked,

1185
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,580
无法开口说话
unable to speak

1186
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:34,020
有人跟我说  莱昂纳尔  你这么会演讲
somebody said, Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.

1187
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,820
你能帮帮这些可怜的人吗
Do you think you can possibly help these poor buggers?

1188
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,940
我做了肌肉治疗练习放松
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation,

1189
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,780
但是我知道要治好还需要更多
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1190
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,000
这些可怜的年轻人害怕的大叫
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear,

1191
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,110
却没有人倾听
no-one was listening to them.

1192
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,750
我的工作就是让他们相信自己的声音
My job was to give them faith in their own voice

1193
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:57,560
让他们知道有个朋友在用心倾听
and let them know that a friend was listening.

1194
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,970
博迪  这一定让你想到自己
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.

1195
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,980
你说得自己真高尚
You give a very noble account of yourself.

1196
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,130
你去打听  这都是事实
Make inquiries. It's all true.

1197
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,760
我都打听过了
Inquiries have been made!

1198
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,800
你不知道多少人在找我的麻烦
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?

1199
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,060
我为你做担保
I vouched for you

1200
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:23,730
可你却连文凭都没有
and you have no... credentials.

1201
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,850
可我成功治好了很多人
But lots of success!

1202
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,360
我拿不出证书给你看
I can't show you certificate...

1203
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,140
那时没有什么培训机构
there was no training then.

1204
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,020
我会的一切都来自于经验
Everything I know I know from experience,

1205
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,550
是那场战争  给我的经验
and that war... was some experience.

1206
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,480
我的牌子上写的是  L・ 罗格  治疗言语缺陷
My plaque says, "L.Logue, Speech Defects."

1207
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,230
没有医生两个字
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.

1208
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,790
把我关进监狱好了
Lock me in the Tower.

1209
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,950
如果可以我早就关了
I would if I could!

1210
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,850
-以什么罪名  -欺诈罪
- On what charge? - Fraud!

1211
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:53,720
战争一触即发
With war looming,

1212
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:56,990
你让一个不能说话的国王坐上王位
you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.

1213
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,340
你毁了我的家庭幸福
You destroyed the happiness of my family.

1214
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,770
所有这一切都是为了欺骗
All for the sake of ensnaring a star...

1215
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:07,240
一个你根本就无法救治的明星病人
patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!

1216
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:13,900
就像疯子国王乔治三世
It'll be like mad... King George the Third,

1217
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:21,430
我就是口吃的疯子国王乔治
there'll be mad King George the stammerer...

1218
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:28,290
在人民最需要的时候让他们失望
who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!

1219
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:29,850
你这是干什么  
What're you doing?

1220
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:31,480
起来  你不能坐在这儿  快起来
Get up! You can't sit there! Get up!

1221
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,740
为什么不能  这就是把椅子 
Why not? It's a chair.

1222
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:36,100
不  那不只是一把椅子  那是  那是
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...

1223
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,040
那是圣爱德华的王座
That is Saint Edward's Chair!

1224
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,700
有人随便在上面刻了自己的名字
People have carved their names on it.

1225
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,380
这把椅子是让历任国王和女王
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen.

1226
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,280
下面还有块大石头
It's held in a place by a large rock!

1227
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,610
那是来自斯昆的石头
That's the Stone of Scone yard,

1228
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,990
-你亵渎一切  -你相信这套吗
- you are trivialising everything. - You believe such bollocks.

1229
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:48,880
你亵渎一切
You're trivialising everything!

1230
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,690
我可不在乎有多少...
I don't care how many royal...

1231
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,550
-听我说  听我说  -皇族蠢货坐在这椅子上
- Listen to me. Listen to me! - arse have sat in this chair.

1232
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,560
-听我说  -听你说  凭什么
- Listen to me! - Listen to you? By what right?

1233
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:55,570
神授王权  我是你的国王
By the divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!

1234
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,250
不  你不是  你自己告诉过我
No you're not! You told me so yourself.

1235
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,420
你说过你并不想做国王
You said you didn't want it.

1236
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,820
那我为什么还要浪费时间听你说话
Why should I waste my time listening to you?

1237
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,960
因为我有权被倾听
Because I have a right to be heard!

1238
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,410
-听什么  -听我说话
- Heard as what? - I HAVE A VOICE!

1239
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,860
没错
Yes you do.

1240
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:21,440
你有毅力
You have such a perservance,

1241
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,680
博迪  你是我见过的最勇敢的人
Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.

1242
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,410
你会成为一个非常好的国王
And you'll make a bloody good king.

1243
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,600
这到底是怎么了  陛下
What on earth's going on, Sir?

1244
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,200
一切正常  主教大人
It's quite alright, Archbishop.

1245
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,280
罗格先生  我要告诉你
Mr Logue, you must know

1246
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,500
我已经找了一个非常有资质的
that I found a replacement English specialist

1247
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,860
英国专家来替代你
with impeccable credentials.

1248
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,570
你的工作即将结束
Hence, your services will no longer be required.

1249
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:47,760
你说什么
I'm sorry?

1250
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,450
陛下的工作是咨询并听取建议
Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.

1251
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,120
而您没有咨询  但刚得到建议
And you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.

1252
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,020
我来给你提个建议
Now I advise you:

1253
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,700
在这  种私人问题上  我会自己做决定
In this personal matter I will make my own decision.

1254
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:07,840
我是为加冕国王的安危着想
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.

1255
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:12,890
我很感激  主教大人  但这是我自己的事情
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!

1256
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:16,890
恕我告退
Your humble servant.

1257
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,830
谢谢  博迪
Thank you Bertie.

1258
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,010
我们排练吧  坐在您的位子上 
Shall we rehearse? Come on upon your purge.

1259
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:42,440
当您和伊丽莎白从西门进来之后
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door,

1260
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:46,340
您将听到赞歌  "我很高兴他们对我说"
you'll be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said onto me"

1261
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,340
其实您也没那么高兴
Actually you won't be that glad,

1262
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,340
因为他们会在那里唱很久
because they sing it for a very long time.

1263
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,110
然后  你的朋友
Then your friend

1264
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:56,310
主教大人会面向你走上台阶
the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you

1265
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,810
说  "陛下  您愿意宣誓吗"
and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The oath"

1266
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:05,410
-"我愿意"  -你当然愿意
- "I am willing" - Course you are!

1267
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,030
我得去最后面的位子听下效果
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats

1268
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,280
保证连您的老保姆也能听到
so even your old nanny can hear.

1269
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,510
"您愿意根据当地习俗统治不列颠  爱尔兰
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1270
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:21,010
加拿大  澳大利亚  以及新西兰的人民吗"
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs"

1271
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:23,810
"我在此庄严承诺"
"I solemnly promise so do so."

1272
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,610
大点声  我在后面听不到
Louder! I can't hear you up the back.

1273
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:28,620
"我在此庄严承诺"
"I solemnly promise so do so."

1274
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,220
很好
Very good!

1275
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:33,630
您愿意以仁爱之心用法律和公正的判断
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy,

1276
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,860
来行使您的权利吗
to be executed in all your judgements?"

1277
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,880
"我愿意"  "我愿意"
"I will." "I WILL!"

1278
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,610
之后会有很长一段是关于坚持信念的
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith,

1279
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:45,310
继续的也是废话  废话  废话  直到你最后说
goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. To which you finally say...

1280
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:50,000
"我在这里所承诺的事
"The things which I have... here before promised,

1281
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,500
我会一如既往的履行"
I will perform and keep."

1282
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,290
上帝保佑
So help me God

1283
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:58,470
你要说的就是这些  只有四句
And that's all you'll say. Four short responses,

1284
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:01,420
亲吻那本书  在誓约上签字  你就是国王了
kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.

1285
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:03,760
很简单
Easy.

1286
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,890
您差点把王冠戴反了  主教大人
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!

1287
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:25,230
有人把标志王冠反面的线弄掉了  陛下
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.

1288
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:28,190
别把线弄掉  主教大人
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.

1289
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,100
主教先生  我们看不到爸爸了
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1290
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:39,000
非常好  非常好  主教大人
Very good, very good. Archbishop.

1291
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:43,570
我希望国王和王后陛下对结果满意
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.

1292
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,800
现在你可以把机器关掉了
You could switch that machine off now.

1293
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:48,890
不要  等等  继续放
No, wait, keep going.

1294
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,490
请坐下吧  主教大人
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

1295
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,290
爸爸  爸爸  他在说什么
Papa? Papa, what's he saying?

1296
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:17,730
不知道  但他似乎说的很好
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.

1297
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:41,220
陛下  我今天来见您
Sir, I have asked to see you today...

1298
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:46,220
是为了向您辞去首相的职务
in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.

1299
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,030
听你这么说我很难过  鲍德温先生
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.

1300
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:55,150
内维尔・张伯伦会接替首相之职
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.

1301
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:58,760
我在一个重大问题上做了错误的决定
It's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.

1302
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,840
很难想象  这个世界上
I have found it impossible to believe...

1303
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,370
竟然有像希特勒这样
that there is any man in the world...

1304
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:11,320
如此缺乏道德感
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1305
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:15,700
而这个世界也很可能会
but the world may be hurled for...

1306
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:19,730
再次陷入战争灾难的深渊
a second time into the abyss of destructive War.

1307
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,430
一直以来丘吉尔都是对的
Churchill was right all along.

1308
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:27,230
这就是希特勒的野心
This was always Hitler's intention.

1309
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,730
在这危急时刻离开您  我感到很抱歉
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.

1310
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,330
国王陛下  我很担心
I am very much afraid Sir,

1311
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:41,750
您将面临最大的考验
that your greatest test is yet to come.

1312
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:51,500
我在唐宁街10号的内阁会议室
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room...

1313
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,210
发表广播(1939年9月3日)
at 10 Downing Street.

1314
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,420
今天早晨  英国驻柏林大使
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin...

1315
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:02,500
提交了一份德国政府的最后声明
handed the German Government a final note...

1316
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:08,330
如果我们在11点之前没有得到知会
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 oclock,

1317
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,640
既是表示德国已经做好准备
that they were prepared at once...

1318
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,650
立即从波兰撤军
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1319
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:17,600
德英两国随即进入战争状态
a state of war would exist between us.

1320
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,020
我要告诉你们的是
I have to tell you now

1321
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:24,210
我们并未收到任何知会
that no such undertaking has been received,

1322
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:30,490
因此  德英两国已经进入战争状态
and that consequently, this country is at war with Germany.

1323
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,960
最后  陛下  这是您的演讲稿  
At last Sir, here is your speech.

1324
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,670
6点开始直播
You are on air at six.

1325
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:46,800
时间不超过9分钟
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.

1326
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,240
措辞经过充分推敲
The wording is fully approved.

1327
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:52,220
首相先生也将在广播中发表演说
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast

1328
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,640
这次广播将在全国
which will go out live across the Nation,

1329
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,660
整个帝国及军队播放
the Empire and to our Armed Forces.

1330
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:58,360
马上把罗格叫过来
Get Logue here immediately.

1331
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:15,600
-那是防空气球  -是呀
- There's the barrage balloons. - Yes.

1332
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,990
-他们动作倒是挺快  -是啊
- They got them up there quickly. - Yeah.

1333
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:35,020
我们是不是停车找掩体躲避
Should we pull over and find shelter?

1334
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,970
不  继续开  没事的
No, go straight on. We'll be alright

1335
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,500
-您好  先生  -我是莱昂纳尔・罗格
- Yes. Sir? - Lionel Logue.

1336
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,470
哈特利大人正在等我  这是我的儿子劳里
Major Hartley's expecting me. This is my son Laury.

1337
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:01,290
-谢谢  劳里  -一切顺利  爸爸
- Thank you, Laurie. - Good luck, Dad.

1338
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,540
-这是国王的演讲稿  -谢谢  先生
- The King's Speech. - Thank you, Sir.

1339
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:11,890
现在离直播还有大约40分钟
We have about forty minutes to the broadcast.

1340
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:17,030
非常感谢  谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1341
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:23,370
"我们前方也许是黑暗"
"there may be dark days ahead, and..."

1342
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,790
再来一次
Try again.

1343
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:33,590
"我们前方也许是黑暗"
"there may be dark days ahead, and..."

1344
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:36,730
在卡住的地方停顿
Turn the hesitations into pauses...

1345
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,540
然后自言自语说  天佑吾王
and say to yourself, "God save the King."

1346
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:42,090
这句话我经常说  可明显没人听
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.

1347
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:45,560
长的停顿很好  在重大场合更显庄重
Long pauses are good. They add solemnity to great occasions.

1348
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,460
那我就是最为庄重的国王
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.

1349
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:52,890
如果我是国王  权利何在 
You know, if I am to be King, where is my power?

1350
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,340
我能  我能重组内阁吗
Can I... Can I reform a government?

1351
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,960
我能  我能征税吗  能宣战吗  不能
Can I... Can I... levy a tax? Declare a war? No.

1352
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:03,260
而我是所有职权的代表  为什么
Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why?

1353
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:08,960
因为民众相信我是为了他们讲话
Because the Nation believes that when I... I speak, I speak for them.

1354
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:10,560
但我却不善于讲话
But I cannot speak!

1355
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,870
我们从头再来一遍  
Let's take it all again from the top.

1356
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,800
从"在这一庄严时刻"开始
"In this grave hour"

1357
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,470
在这一庄严时刻  操  操  操
In this grave hour... Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1358
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,780
也许是我们有史以来最生死攸关的时刻  混蛋  日  日
perhaps the most fateful in our history... Bugger, shit, shit.

1359
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:38,480
我要向所有家庭
I send to every household of my...

1360
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:43,620
就算我唱着说  "人"也总是很难发音 
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.

1361
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:45,700
遇到"人"的时候用"一个人"代替
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."

1362
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,560
-而不是"人"  -一个人
- Not people. - A people.

1363
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,380
大英人民的所有家庭  无论是在国内
Household of my peoples both at home...

1364
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:55,590
-还是海外  -很好
- and overseas. - Beautiful.

1365
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,520
传达这一消息  啦啦啦
this message, doo-dah day.

1366
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,390
怀着同样的深刻情感  啦啦啦
spoken with the same depth of feeling. Doo-dah day...

1367
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,390
对你们每个人说  就好像我在  日  操  混蛋
for each one of you as if I were able to... Shit, fuck, bugger!

1368
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,450
和你们面对面交流
cross your threshold and speak to you...

1369
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:12,340
你要在脑子里想  我有权力要你们都听到
In your head, now. "I have a right to be bloody well heard."

1370
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:16,090
都听到  都听到  都听到我说话
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!

1371
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:19,090
来段华尔兹  动起来  动作流畅 
Now, waltz. Move. Get continuous movement.

1372
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:24,830
对大多数人来说  在有生之年  我们第二次...
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at...

1373
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:28,550
-"我们"要停顿一下  -莱昂纳尔  我做不来
- "We are," Take a pause. - Lionel, I can't do this.

1374
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,640
博迪  你可以的
Bertie, you can do it.

1375
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,260
-再看一下最后一段  -博迪  时间到了
- Have a look at the last paragraph. - Bertie, it's time.

1376
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:52,300
-主教大人  -国王陛下
- Archbishop. - Your Majesty.

1377
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,090
伟大的时刻  陛下
A great moment, Sir.

1378
01:38:59,570 --> 01:39:01,770
-首相  -国王陛下
- Prime Minister. - Your Majesty.

1379
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:08,150
我们又见面了  真快
Nice to see you... again so soon.

1380
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:14,840
你能来很好  
Good of you to be here.

1381
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:19,430
我相信你刚度过了繁忙的一天
I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.

1382
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:21,410
希望我们不会再被那些
Let's hope we have no more

1383
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:23,810
该死的警报声打断  阁下
interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.

1384
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:25,990
或者那些可怜的小狗们
Or the wretched dogs.

1385
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:31,400
恭喜你荣任海军大臣  
Congrat... Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty.

1386
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,430
谢谢国王陛下
Your Majesty.

1387
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,460
很长...  一段路
The long... walk.

1388
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:43,750
一切顺利  陛下
Good luck, Sir.

1389
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,040
我也害怕这种仪器
I, too, dread this apparatus.

1390
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,670
您知道吗  我也曾口吃
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.

1391
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:56,190
-没听说过  -家族秘密  舌头打结
- I didn't. - Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1392
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,620
手术风险很大
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.

1393
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:03,220
最终我把它变成长处了
I eventually made an asset of it.

1394
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:08,540
-谢谢  丘吉尔先生  -陛下请
- Thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.

1395
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,770
亲爱的
Darling.

1396
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:11,900
还有多久  罗格  
How long, Logue?

1397
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,990
不到3分钟  陛下
Just under three minutes, Sir.

1398
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:47,050
-伍德先生  -好运  陛下
- Mr Wood. - Good luck, Your Majesty.

1399
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:51,100
伍德先生
Mr Wood.

1400
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:53,700
你会被授予奖章  罗格  
You'll be decorated, Logue.

1401
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,160
拿来当杯垫
I made it cosy.

1402
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:58,700
来点新鲜空气
Some fresh air.

1403
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,910
来吧  亲爱的
There you are, Darling.

1404
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:07,240
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve

1405
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:10,180
不吃葡萄倒吐葡萄皮
of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.

1406
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,910
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
I've a sieve of sifted thistles

1407
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:14,510
不吃葡萄倒吐葡萄皮
and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...

1408
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,560
博迪  亲爱的  别忘了开关
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!

1409
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:19,860
记住红灯闪烁4次之后
Remember the red light will blink four times

1410
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:22,090
我会叫他们关灯
and then I've asked them to turn it off,

1411
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,660
因为不想
because we don't want that

1412
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,400
让那只邪恶的眼睛一直盯着你
evil eye staring at you all the way through.

1413
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:28,190
还有1分钟  陛下
One minute, sir.

1414
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:32,930
我肯定你会做得非常好
I am sure you will be splendid.

1415
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:46,480
40秒  陛下
Fourty seconds, Sir.

1416
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:53,150
罗格 不管结果如何
Logue, however this turns out,

1417
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,580
我都不知道该如何感谢你
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.

1418
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:03,230
授爵行吗
Knighthood?

1419
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:09,450
20秒
Twenty seconds.

1420
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:20,220
抛开一切  只要对着我说话就好
Forget everything else and just say it to me.

1421
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:22,910
对着我说  就像对朋友说
Say it to me, as a friend.

1422
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,050
在这一庄严时刻
In this grave hour,

1423
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:21,220
也许是我们有史以来生死攸关的时刻
perhaps the most fateful in our history,

1424
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:32,880
我要向大英人民的每个家庭
I send to every household of my peoples,

1425
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,830
无论是在国内
both at home...

1426
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:43,940
还是海外
and overseas,

1427
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:55,830
传达这一消息
this message...

1428
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:01,440
和你们一样 
spoken with the same depth of feeling...

1429
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,250
怀着同样深刻的感受
for each one of you...

1430
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:09,160
就好像我在和你们
as if I were able to cross your threshold...

1431
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,810
面对面交谈
and speak to you myself.

1432
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,140
对我们大多数人来说  有生之年
For the second time in the lives of most of us,

1433
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:27,670
我们再一次面临  面临战争
we are at... at war.

1434
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:36,140
一次有一次
Over and over again,

1435
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:40,460
我们竭尽全力
we have tried to find...

1436
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:51,130
想为我们和那些如今成为敌人的人之间的差异
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves...

1437
01:44:52,550 --> 01:45:00,180
找到和平的解决办法
and those who are now our enemies.

1438
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:05,410
但终是突然
But it has been in vain.

1439
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,000
我们被迫面临冲突
We have been forced into a conflict.

1440
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:17,040
因为我们是被号召去挑战一种信条
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle

1441
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,680
这种信条如果获胜
which, if it were to prevail,

1442
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:25,000
将是对全世界文明秩序的
would be fatal to any civilized order...

1443
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:27,680
致命打击
in the world.

1444
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:30,870
这种信条
Such a principle,

1445
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:36,200
剥除所有伪装
stripped of all disguise,

1446
01:45:37,650 --> 01:45:40,240
无疑是一种简单的
is surely the mere...

1447
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:50,130
原始信条  那就是强权即真理
primitive doctrine that might is right.

1448
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:56,890
为了我们所珍惜的一切
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear,

1449
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:08,100
毫无疑问  我们不应拒绝迎接这种挑战
it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.

1450
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:18,270
为了这个崇高的目标  在此
It is to this high purpose that I now call...

1451
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:26,100
我号召海内外所有的大英臣民
my people at home and my peoples across the seas,

1452
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:31,470
将我们事业当作自己的事业
who will make our cause their own.

1453
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:38,010
请你们保持镇静和坚定
I ask them to stand calm and firm,

1454
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:43,020
在此危难之时团结一致
and united in this time of trial.

1455
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,450
任务十分艰巨
The task will be hard.

1456
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:51,440
我们前方也许是黑暗
There may be dark days ahead,

1457
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:59,250
而战争也将不再局限于战场
and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.

1458
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:04,940
但我们只能做我们认为正确的事情
But we can only do the right as we see the right...

1459
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:13,950
并向上帝虔诚祈祷
and reverently commit our cause to God.

1460
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:23,950
如果我们所有人都能坚定信念
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it,

1461
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:29,150
那么  有上帝的庇佑
then, with God's help,

1462
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:34,760
我们将取得胜利
we shall prevail.

1463
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,700
非常好  博迪
Very good, Bertie.

1464
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:09,060
你说"和"还是有点结巴
You still stammered on the "w"?

1465
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:13,810
总得结巴几下  他们才知道是我
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.

1466
01:48:19,150 --> 01:48:22,200
恭喜您  国王陛下  一次真正的广播
Congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.

1467
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:23,800
谢谢  伍德先生
Thank you, Mr Wood.

1468
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:29,040
恭喜您  国王陛下
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1469
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:32,770
-恭喜您  陛下  -谢谢
- Congratulations, your Majesty. - Thank you.

1470
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,200
好了
Ready.

1471
01:48:46,090 --> 01:48:47,590
-行吗  -很好
- Good? - Perfect.

1472
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:53,860
你的首次战争演讲  恭喜
Your first war time speech. Congratulations.

1473
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,210
我还应做的更好
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.

1474
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,890
谢谢你  罗格
Thank you, Logue.

1475
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:17,830
干得好  我的朋友
Well done, my friend.

1476
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,810
谢谢您  国王陛下
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1477
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,470
我知道你行的
I knew you'd be good.

1478
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:50,470
谢谢你  莱昂纳尔
Thank you, Lionel.

1479
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:55,650
继续吧
Onwards?

1480
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,370
恭喜您  陛下
Congratulations, Sir.

1481
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:01,810
您做得比我还好  陛下
Almost did it better than myself, Sir.

1482
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:04,600
国王陛下  您让我难以言表
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.

1483
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:06,670
恭喜您  陛下
Congratulations, Sir.

1484
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:07,970
先生们
Gentlemen.

1485
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:10,440
恭喜您  国王陛下
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1486
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:12,260
你觉得爸爸怎么样  伊丽莎吧
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?

1487
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:17,970
开始有些吞吐  但已经很好了  爸爸
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.

1488
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,640
亲一个
Bless you.

1489
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:24,460
-你觉得呢  玛格丽特  -真是太精彩了  爸爸
- And how about you, Margaret? - You were just splendid, Papa.

1490
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:25,930
那当然了
Of course I was.

1491
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,480
都准备好了吗
We all ready?

1492
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:31,710
来吧姑娘们
Come on girls.

1493
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:46,440
1944年

1494
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:46,440
乔治六世国王为莱昂纳尔・罗格授予了英国皇家维多利亚勋章

1495
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:46,440
这是为感谢为君主个人服务而特别设立的唯一勋章

1496
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:56,510
此后国王的每一次战争演讲都有莱昂纳尔陪同

1497
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:56,510
通过广播  乔治六世国王成为国家抵抗的象征
