00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,480
国王陛下的

31
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,470
1934年  伦敦  皮卡迪利大街145号

32
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,050
深深吸进肺里  殿下
Inhale deep into your lungs..Your Royal Highness.

33
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,960
这能放松您的喉咙  是吧
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

34
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,210
吸烟让您精神放松并给您自信

35
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,720
殿下  请您张开手
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...

36
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,900
这是消过毒的
It's Sterilized. Now..

37
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:03,470
一  二  三  四  五  六  七
One,two,three,four,five,six,seven.

38
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,560
恕我冒昧
Now...if I may take the liberty?

39
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,760
请把它们含在嘴里
...insert them into your mouth.

40
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,220
抱歉  医生  请问这样做是为了什么
Excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?

41
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,450
这是传统疗法  它治好了德摩斯梯尼(古希腊雄辩家)
It is the classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.

42
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,410
那是在古希腊
That was in ancient Greece...uh

43
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,060
现在还管用吗
Has it worked since?

44
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,410
现在  请您读一下

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,790
这几段话
A wealth of words.

46
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,420
克服那些弹珠的阻碍  殿下
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.

47
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,460
读出来
Enunciate!

48
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,080
再专心一点  殿下 
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.

49
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,260
我差点吞了这些该死的玩意儿
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

50
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,750
谢谢您  医生
Thank you so much, Doctor,

51
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,950
这非常  有意思
it's been most...hmm interesting.

52
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,750
殿下
Your highness.

53
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,310
含弹珠
Insert marbles!

54
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,030
他怎么不自己含
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!

55
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,520
你不能总这样  博迪
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.

56
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
我知道
I know.

57
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,070
答应我  答应我  治疗到此为止
Promise me. Promise me, no more.

58
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,470
哈里街

59
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,470
查普曼医生
L・罗格  语言障碍

60
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,660
你好  有人在吗
Hello. Is anyone there?

61
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,470
我在厕所里
I'm just in the loo.

62
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,360
约翰逊夫人  您来了
Ah, Mrs.Johnson There you are.

63
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,720
抱歉  我这没前台  我喜欢简单
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist. I like to keep things simple.

64
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,220
乐而安贫就是富
Poor and content is rich and rich enough.

65
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,310
-什么  -莎士比亚说的  您好
- Sorry?  - Shakespeare. How are you?

66
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,470
您好
How do you do?

67
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,670
我近来咳嗽不断
Coughing a lot.

68
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,480
这有点棘手  但是  恐怕您迟到了
Now, this is slightly awkward, But.. I'm afraid you're late.

69
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,960
是的  恐怕是的
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

70
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,910
约翰逊先生呢
Where's Mr Johnson?

71
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,120
他不知道我来
He doesn't know I'm here.

72
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,400
这个开头可不好
That's not a promising start.

73
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,750
我丈夫求医无数  皆无好转
Look, my husband has seen everyone to no avail.

74
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,880
恐怕他已经放弃了
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.

75
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,830
他还没见过我
He hasn't seen me.

76
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,410
你很自信
You're awfully sure of yourself.

77
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,070
我对每个期望治好的人都满怀信心
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.

78
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,070
当然他想要治好
Of course, he wishes to be cured.

79
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,110
我丈夫  需要在公开场合讲话
My husband is umm.. he's required to speak publicly.

80
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,070
或许他该换个工作
Perhaps he should change jobs?

81
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,580
不行
He can't.

82
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,030
卖身契
Indentured servitude?

83
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,880
差不多
Something of that nature. Yes.

84
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,580
那么  你老公得过来
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...

85
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,960
周二可以
Uh..Tuesday would be good...

86
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,960
他可以跟我说下个人情况
He can give me his personal details

87
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,600
我来做个准确评估  然后开始治疗
and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.

88
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,600
抱歉  医生
Doctor, forgive me.

89
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,690
我不称他为老公  我们也不过来
I do not have a hubby. We don't pop.

90
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,890
更不对外人讲我们的私生活
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.

91
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,650
您  必须来我家
You... must come to us.

92
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,420
抱歉  约翰逊夫人  我的地盘听我的
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.

93
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,460
你得说服你丈夫
You'll have to talk over this with your husband

94
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,230
然后给我打电话
and then you can speak to me on the telephone.

95
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,860
感谢你来访  再见
Thank you very much for dropping by... Good afternoon.

96
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,240
如果我丈夫是约克公爵呢
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?

97
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,000
约克公爵
The Duke of York?

98
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,900
是的  约克公爵
Yes... the Duke of York.

99
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,130
我以为预约的是约翰逊  抱歉  殿...
I thought the appointment was for Johnson? Forgive me, your ...?

100
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,930
殿下
..Royal Highness.

101
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,890
大战时他用这个姓
Johnson was used during the Great War;

102
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,630
皇家海军不想让敌人知道他在船上
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know he was aboard.

103
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,810
我被当成敌人吗
Am I...considered the enemy?

104
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,490
是的  如果您不合作  而且你得严格保密
You will be, if you remain unobliging. And you have to have abosolute descretion.

105
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,720
当然  殿下  您是怎么找到我的
Of course. How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?

106
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,140
通过语言矫治协会的会长
The President of society of the Speech Therapists.

107
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,700
艾琳・麦克卢尔  她是我的朋友
Eileen McCleod? She's a sport.

108
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,420
麦克卢尔医生提醒我说
Dr McCleod warned me your

109
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,990
您的澳洲式疗法是异端而且颇有争议
antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.

110
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,560
我告诉她  我不爱听那些词
I warned her... those were not my favorite words.

111
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,630
我可以为您丈夫治疗
I can cure your husband.

112
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,820
但用我的办法需要信任和彻底的平等
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;

113
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,200
并在我的诊室里进行
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.

114
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,070
概不例外
No exceptions.

115
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,900
那么  既然这样
Well then, in that case...

116
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,770
您什么时候可以开始
When can you start?

117
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,490
听起来还是有点刺耳  小伙子
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.

118
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,370
是你让我开得太慢了  老爸 
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

119
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,390
你去桥那边接你妈了吗
Did you pick mum up from bridge?

120
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,180
是的  一整天我都开着车到处跑
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.

121
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,530
今天下午  来了位特别的客人
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

122
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,370
-我可以离桌了吧  -怎么个特别法
- May I please leave this table.  - How special, special?

123
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,980
不行  小蠢蛋
No, You must stay, bored stupid,

124
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,170
你得留下来听你爸妈无聊的谈话
listening to your parents'inane conversation.

125
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,470
-谢谢爸爸  -还有你妈
- Thanks Dad..  - and Mum.

126
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,990
谢谢妈妈
And mom.

127
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,070
-我也走了  -去见简吗
- Me too.  - You meeting Jean?

128
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,440
不是  别人
No, someone else.

129
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,030
博士  博士  你能帮兄弟们洗碗吗
Doctor? Doctor? Can't you help your brother with the washing...

130
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,830
我正忙着呢
I'm fine.

131
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,330
是谁  莱昂内尔
Who's it Lionel?

132
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,120
不能说提它干嘛
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?

133
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,120
莫特尔  只是一个女人  想帮她丈夫
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.

134
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,810
还有  我接到一个电话
Oh! And I had a call.

135
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,730
得到一个试镜机会
For an audition.

136
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,580
-我的最爱之一  -所有角色不都是你最爱吗
- One of my favorites.  - Aren't they all?

137
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,460
很有意思的角色
It could be a lot of fun.

138
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,620
我相信你会做得很好
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

139
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,290
是个有威望的剧团
They're a highly regarded group.

140
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,410
来自普特尼
From Putney.

141
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,650
明天读第四章
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.

142
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,150
飞行
The flight

143
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,470
-我都不知道他会飞  -我都等不及了
- Mama, I don't know he can fly at all. - I can't wait

144
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,470
他们能飞走
Oh, they can fly away

145
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,750
不是很幸运吗
Weren't they lucky!

146
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,930
那爸爸讲个故事吧
Now Papa tell a story!

147
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,110
我装企鹅还不行吗
Could I be a penguin instead?

148
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,320
我想听企鹅的故事
Well, now I want a penguin story.

149
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
讲个短的
Very quickly.

150
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,560
从前  有两个公主
Once, there were two princesses...

151
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,700
伊丽莎白公主和玛格丽特公主
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.

152
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,360
她们的爸爸是只企鹅
whose Papa was a penguin.

153
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,180
因为邪恶的女巫对他施了魔咒
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.

154
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,240
这让他为难
This was an... inconvenient for him..

155
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:21,320
因为他喜欢用手怀抱两个公主
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms...

156
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,290
但企鹅不行  因为他长着青鱼般的翅膀
and penguin can't because he has wings like herrings

157
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,070
青鱼没有翅膀
Herrings don't have wings.

158
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,310
企鹅翅膀的形状像青鱼
Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings

159
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,990
但更糟的是
and make matters worse...

160
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,670
女巫把他扔到了南极
is that she sent him to the South Pole.

161
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,100
回来的路很遥远
which is an awfully long walk..back.

162
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,910
除非会飞
if you can't fly.

163
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,260
所以  他来到水边
So..When he reached the water,

164
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,030
迅速潜入水中
he dived in through the dept so fast...

165
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,120
中午时他已抵达南汉普顿海域
that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.

166
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,050
在那儿搭两点半的船
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge,

167
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,500
然后在克拉珀姆换船
changed at Clapham Junction and

168
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,630
向一只路过的野鸭打听去白金汉宫的路
asked a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.

169
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,760
他游过泰晤士河  从出水孔里钻出来
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole,

170
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,710
让厨师
and gave the cook,

171
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,670
妈妈还有惠特克太太吃了一惊
Mama and ...Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.

172
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,920
女孩儿们听到了一片混乱
Now when the girls heard all the commotions,

173
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,210
她们跑进厨房给他彻底地洗了个澡
they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub,

174
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,500
并给了他一条马鲛鱼和一个吻
a mackerel and a kiss.

175
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,460
当她们吻他时
and as they kissed him,

176
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,940
猜他变成了什么
guess what he turned into?

177
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,710
一个英俊的王子
A handsome prince.

178
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,070
一只短尾巴的信天翁
A short-tailed Albatross.

179
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,800
有一双大翅膀
With wings so big

180
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,610
这样他就可以一把搂过他的两个女儿了
that he could wrap them both his two girls together.

181
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,380
好了  该睡觉了  快点
Now, now.. It's time for bed.Come on.

182
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,380
把这两匹小马拉回马厩
Take these horsies to stable.

183
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,470
-晚安  -晚安

喂食刷洗然后睡觉
Feed them, bath them and to bed.

185
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,760
辛普森夫人会参加吗

186
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,240
我哥哥坚持让她来

187

他是认真的吗
Is he serious?

188
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,520
让她参加晚宴吗
About her coming to dinner?

189
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,200
不是  对她
No. About her!

190
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,950
一个有夫之妇  他不会的
A married woman? He can't be.

191
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,950
她会

192
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,950
对了
By the way,

193

我发现一个很有趣的人

在哈里大街  一个医生

195
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,630
绝不

196
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,440
我不想再谈了  到此为止
I'm not having this conversation again. The matter's settled.

197
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,090
他的方法好像很特别
His approach seems rather different....

198

200

如今约克之子把我们讨厌的冬天

变成了灿烂的夏天

所有掠过我们家园的乌云

203
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,860
都被深埋在海洋的怀抱中
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

204
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,660
现在  我们的双眉周围缠绕着凯旋的花环
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;

205
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,860

209
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,940
我听不出这是一个丑陋的家伙

想要成为国王的呐喊

211
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,290
也看不出理查三世像殖民地的国王
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.

212

更有帝王气质的人

分类广告
Classifieds,

225
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,210
紧挨着"法国模特  请联系牧羊菜市场"那条

228
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,060

第一次来见我时
He could hardly make a sound, you know,

242
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,240
他几乎一个音都发不出

243
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,010
我儿子们的杰作  不错吧

有人告诉我不要坐得太近

246
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,220
我认为和王子说话时

要等王子选话题

除非您愿意被治疗
Only if you're interested in being treated.

257
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,190
请叫我莱昂内尔

258
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,440
我更愿称你为先生

259
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,710
我更愿被称为莱昂内尔  我该怎么称呼您

260
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,520
殿下  之后可以称阁下 
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.

261
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,120
在这个场合太正式了  您的名字是
A little bit formal for here. I prefer names.

262
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,480
阿尔伯特・弗雷德里克・亚瑟・乔治王子
Prince Albert ...Frederick Arthur George.

263
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,830
叫博迪怎样

264
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,220
只有我的家人那么叫
Only my family uses that.

265
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,860
很好  在这里  我们平等相处比较好
Perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.

266
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,970
如果我们真平等  我就不用来了
If we were equals, I wouldn't be here.

267
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,970
在家陪妻子
I'd be at home with my wife

268
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,030
谁管我结巴
and no one would give a damn.

269
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,910
请不要抽烟
Please, Don't do that.

270
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,190
什么
I'm sorry?

271
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,810
我认为抽烟对您的健康不利
I believe, sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.

272
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,290
我的医生说这能放松喉咙
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.

273
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,610
一群白痴
They're idiots.

274
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,070
他们都是御医
They've all been knighted.

275
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,170
那就是官方认证的白痴
Makes it official then.

276
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,770
我的地盘我做主
My castle, my rules.

277
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,490
谢谢
Thank you.

278
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,260
请问你最早的记忆是
What was your earliest memory?

279
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,820
什  什么意思
What on earth do you mean?

280
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
你记得的第一件事
Your first recollection.

281
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,120
我不
I'm not...

282
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,520
不是来谈私事的
here to discuss my personal matters.

283
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,840
那您来干什么
Why're you here then?

284
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,020
因为我他妈的结巴
Because I am bloody well stammer!

285
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,750
您脾气挺大
You have a bit of a temper?

286
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,780
这是我缺点之一
One of my many faults.

287
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,540
结巴是从何时开始的
When did the defect start?

288
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
一直都这样
I've always been this way!

289
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
我觉得不是
I doubt that.

290
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,810
你知道什么  结巴的是我
Don't tell me! It's my stammer!

291
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,810
可我是专家
It's my field.

292
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,480
我向您保证  口吃绝非天生
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.

293
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,540
您是几岁开始的
When did yours start?

294
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,770
四五岁
Four or five.

295
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,280
一般都是这个年纪
That's typical.

296
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,480
都这么说
So I've been told.

297
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,350
我记事起就结巴了
I can't remember not doing it.

298
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,550
我知道
I can believe that.

299
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,180
您思考的时候也会停顿吗
Do you hesitate when you think?

300
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,850
胡说
Don't be ridiculous.

301
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,400
自言自语时呢
How about when you talk to yourself?

302
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,310
博迪  所有人都会偶尔自言自语
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.

303
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,000
别那么叫我
Stop calling me that.

304
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,810
我就这么叫
I'm not going to call you anything else.

305
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,660
那就别说了
Then we shan't speak!

306
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,560
医生  这次你收钱吗
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

307
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,290
收  一大笔呢
A fortune.

308
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,120
泡一会再喝
I'll just let that brew.

309
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,510
那么  自言自语时  你结巴吗
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?

310
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,840
当然不会
Of course not!

311
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,130
那您的结巴还能治好
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.

312
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,490
你觉得病因是什么
What do you think was the cause?

313
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,560
我不 不知道
I don't...Don't know.

314
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,560
也不  不在乎  我就是结巴
I don't care! I stammer!

315
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,080
没人能治好
And no one can fix it.

316
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,070
我打赌  您此时此刻就能流利地朗诵
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.

317
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,010
要是我赢  我就要问您更多问题 
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.

318
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,590
-如果我赢呢  -您不必回答
- And if I win? - You don't have to answer.

319
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,430
一般人都  都赌钱
One usually... wagers money.

320
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,420
每人一先令作为开始
A bob each to keep it sweet?

321
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:27,300
-你出一先令  -我不  不带钱
- Let's see your shilling?? - I don't... carry money.

322
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,500
就知道您没有
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

323
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,080
我借您  下回还我
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.

324
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,750
谁说有下回
Who says there is a next time?

325
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,450
那倒是  我还没决定给您治疗
I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.

326
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,020
请起立  看这个
Please stand. And take a look at that.

327
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,700
我读  读不了
I can't...can't read this.

328
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,650
您都没试就输给我一先令
Then you owe me a shilling, for not trying.

329
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,140
活着  还是死去  这...
To be... or not to be, that...

330
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,350
我读不了
I can't read!

331
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,800
还没完呢
I haven't finished yet.

332
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,380
我用这机器给您录音
I'm going to record your voice

333
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,750
再放出来给您听
and then play it back to you on the same machine.

334
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,210
这机器棒极了
This is brilliant.

335
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,610
美国的最新产品  银音牌
It's the latest thing from America: its a Silvertone.

336
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,070
戴上这个
Pop this on?

337
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,250
伙计  这能赚一先令  您可以满载而归
There's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!

338
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,060
-这在放音乐  -我知道
- You're playing music. - I know.

339
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,490
那我怎么听见自己说什么
How can I hear what I'm saying?

340
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,550
王子的脑子肯定知道嘴在说什么
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing.

341
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,000
你一定不了解王子
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

342
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,890
完全没用
Hopeless. Hopeless!

343
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,810
您读得非常好
You were sublime.

344
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,190
我怎么会为了一先令欺骗王子殿下
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve pence?

345
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,070
我怎么知道一个澳洲人
I've no idea what an Australian might do

346
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,880
为了那点钱会做出什么
for that sort of money.

347
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,030
我放出来给您听听
Let me play it back to you.

348
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,400
不用
No.

349
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,770
那好吧  我就要提问了
All right then, I get to ask you the question.

350
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,770
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor,

351
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,800
我觉得这治不好我
I don't feel.. this is for me.

352
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,450
麻烦你了  再见
Thank You for your time, Bye.

353
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,240
阁下
Sir?

354
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,230
录音是免费的
The recording is free.

355
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,780
请收下做纪念
Please keep it as a souvenir.

356
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,080
没用
No.

357
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,990
乔治五世
1934年圣诞讲话
诺福克郡  桑德林姆宫

358
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,770
当前形势下
For the present,

359
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,350
我们共同担当的重任
the work to which we are all equally bound,

360
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,010
便是在全国之内
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity

361
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,480
营造和平平静的环境
within our borders,

362
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,180
在此萧条期间
to regain prosperity at this time of depression

363
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,400
摒弃私心
without self-seeking

364
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,300
与我们这些为之前的重负倍感灰心与挫折的人
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years

365
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,180
再图繁荣
has disheartened or overborne.

366
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,000
祝每位国民圣诞快乐
To all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.

367
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,620
上帝保佑你们
God bless you.

368
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,660
直播结束
And off air.

369
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,300
熟能生巧
Easy when you know how.

370
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,730
阁下
Sir.

371
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,320
你来试试
Have a go yourself.

372
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,600
-演讲很成功  陛下  -伍德先生
- Congratulations, Sir. - Mr. Wood.

373
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,230
他很厉害  
Splendid fellow.

374
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,530
教会我最重要的一条
Chap taught me everything I know:

375
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,350
麦克风自然会播音
let the microphone do the work.

376
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,180
-谢谢  -各位这边走
- Thank you. - Gentlemen.

377
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,450
挺胸坐直
Sit up, straight back,

378
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,630
抬头面对话筒  直视它
face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye

379
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,630
当它是个平民
as you would any decent Englishman.

380
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,250
拿出皇家气派
Show who's in command.

381
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,760
爸爸  我觉得我读不了
Papa, I don't think I can read this.

382
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,990
如果读不了  这该死的东西能毁了一切
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.

383
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,050
过去一个国王要做的事情
In the past all a King had to do was

384
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,230
就是穿上正装摆摆样子别掉下马
look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.

385
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,800
现在我们必须进入平常百姓家
Now we must invade people's homes

386
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,230
去讨好他们
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

387
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,040
所谓皇室家族
This family has been reduced

388
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,750
已经降为最低等的平民
to those lowest, basest of all creatures.

389
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,840
我们变成了演员
We've become actors!

390
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,840
我们不是皇室  而是公司
We're not a family, we're a firm.

391
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
然而某些成员随时会失业
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.

392
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,710
你的兄长  我的王储
Your darling brother, and future king!

393
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,200
他唯一感兴趣的妻子
The only wife he appears interested in

394
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,190
无一例外都是有夫之妇
is invariably the wife of another!

395
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,640
他和弗勒斯女士分手了
He's broken off with Lady Furness.

396
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,660
又看上了辛普森夫人
And taken up a Mrs. Simpson,

397
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,360
一个已经结过两次婚的女人
a woman with two husbands living!

398
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,740
我跟他直说
I told him straight,

399
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,050
皇室不会接受这种女人
no divorced person could ever be received at court.

400
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,180
他说  他感到十分幸福
He said, "It made him sublimely happy."

401
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,680
我想这是因为她已经和他上床了
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.

402
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,430
他说  "我保证"
"I give you my word..." this is what he said.

403
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,340
"我们绝没发生不正当关系"
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,"

404
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,370
当着他父亲的面撒谎
stared square into his father's face... and lied!

405
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,420
等我死了  他用不了一年
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself,

406
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,020
就会毁掉自己  毁掉这个家族  毁掉这个国家
this family, and this nation, within twelve months.

407
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,480
到时谁收拾残局
Who'll pick up the pieces?

408
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,220
希特勒震慑了半个欧洲
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,

409
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,290
另半个在马歇尔・斯大林掌控
Marshall Stalin the other half.

410
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,810
谁来保护英国
Who'll stand between us,

411
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,300
免遭纳粹军队和无产阶级的侵犯
the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?

412
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,290
你能行吗
You?

413
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,240
你哥哥逃避责任
With your older brother shirking his duties,

414
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,050
你势必将更多地做这事情
you're going to have to do a lot more of this.

415
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,460
你自己来一次
Have a go yourself.

416
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,480
-通过无线电  -别紧张  孩子
- With the wireless... - Get it out, boy!

417
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,690
-这一伟大的  现  -现代
- ...one of the m-marvels of m... - Modern...

418
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,240
慢慢来  小心组词 
Just take your time, form your words carefully.

419
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,300
-现代科技  我能够  -放松
- ...science, I am enabled, to... - Relax!

420
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,740
-大胆说  -在这个圣诞节
- Just try it! - This Chrismas Day...

421
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,020
向我的国...
...to speak to all my...

422
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,690
说啊
Do it!

423
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,320
骗人的混蛋
Lying .. bastard.

424
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,830
-这在放音乐  -我知道
- You're playing music. - I know.

425
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,960
我怎么知道自己说什么
How can I hear what I'm saying?

426
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,520
王子的大脑肯定知道嘴在说什么
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?

427
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,190
你不了解王子
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

428
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,220
活着  还是死去  这是个难题
To be, or not to be, that is the question:

429
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,680
哪一种选择更为高贵
whether 'tis nobler in the mind

430
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,400
是甘心忍受残暴命运的飞箭流石
to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

431
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,830
还是奋起搏击无边的苦海
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

432
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,730
通过反抗一了百了
and by opposing end them.

433
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,450
死去  睡去  仅此而已
To die; to sleep; no more.

434
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,120
如果说睡去能了结
and by a sleep to say we end

435
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,800
肉体注定要承受的伤心
the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks

436
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:21,050
以及千百次的打击  那可是...
that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation...

437
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,760
完全没用
Hopeless. Hopeless!

438
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,490
只能治病
Strictly business.

439
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,430
别打听私  私事
No p...personal nonsense.

440
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,690
我想在之前的会面我已经说清楚了
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.

441
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,530
欠我那一先令带了吗
Have you got the shilling you owe me?

442
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,200
没带
No, I haven't.

443
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,700
没想到
Didn't think so.

444
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,660
而且上次你耍花招了
Besides, you tricked me!

445
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,430
身体操练和花招很重要
Physical excercises and tricks are important...

446
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,110
你们的要求
What you're asking

447
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,210
只能治标不治本
will only deal with the surface of the problem.

448
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,950
那不是更有效吗
Is that effecient?

449
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,410
在我看来
No, as far as I see it,

450
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:56,190
我丈夫只是在演讲时有身体上的困难
my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.

451
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,130
也许处理这个就可以了
Maybe just deal with that.

452
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,810
-我愿意刻苦练习  罗格医生  -叫我莱昂内尔
- I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue... - Lionel.

453
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,460
你愿意治我吗
Are you...are you willing to do your part?

454
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,660
行  你想治身体对吧
Alright. You want mechanics?

455
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,640
我要放松你的颚肌  
We need to relax your jaw muscles

456
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,590
练习绕口令  锻炼舌头
and strengthen your tongue by repeating tongue twisters

457
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,900
比如说  四是四  十是十
For example, I am a thistle-sifter.

458
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,890
十四是十四
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and

459
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,470
四十是四十
a sieve of unsifted thistles because I am a thistle-sifter.

460
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
行
Fine!

461
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,450
你的腹肌比较松软
You have a flabby tummy,

462
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,640
我们要花时间增强你的横膈膜力量
we need spend some times to strength in your diaphragm.

463
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,940
很简单的物理治疗
Simple mechanics.

464
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,960
我们就需要这个
That is all we ask.

465
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,130
那我只收一先令就够了
And that's about a shilling's worth.

466
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,640
别提他妈的先令
Forget about the bloody shilling!

467
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,920
我可能时不时地
Perhaps, upon occasions,

468
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:02,030
需要你帮  帮忙
you might be requested to assist

469
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,330
应付些活动
in coping with some minor event.

470
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,090
-你同意吗  -当然
- Will that agreeable? - Of course.

471
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,010
好  您的任务就这些
Yes. And that will be the full extent of your services.

472
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,790
那下周见
Shall I see you next week?

473
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,070
我们得天天见
I shall see you every day.

474
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,030
感觉下巴放松
Feel the loosening of the jaw.

475
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,560
好  来蹦两下  蹦  放松肩膀
Good. Little bounces, bounces. Shoulders loose.

476
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,580
来  甩嘴唇
Now lips.

477
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,340
深吸一口气  扩张胸腔
Take a nice deep breath. Expand your chest..

478
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,540
把手放在肋骨上
put your hands on your ribs.

479
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,030
继续吸  好
Deeper, good.

480
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,000
-感觉如何  -满腹废话
- How do you feel? - Full of hot air.

481
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,950
演说不就是这样吗
Isn't that what public speaking is all about?

482
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,750
我妻子和我很荣幸来参观如此重要的
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...

483
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,430
深深吸气  把殿下顶起来
Take a good deep breath, and up comes Her Royal Highness

484
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,690
慢慢呼气  把殿下放下
and slowly exhale, and down comes Her Royal Highness.

485
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,050
-博迪你还好吗  -好
- You alright, Bertie? - Yes.

486
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,250
这还挺好玩
This is actually quite good fun.

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,860
-母...母亲  -每次都加快  母亲

现在前后摆动
Now just sway.

492
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,210
很好
Perfect.

493
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,720
我们不  不愿
We'll not permit us to...

494
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,690
-放松肩膀  -打南边来了个喇嘛
- Loosen the shoulders. - Ding dong bell,

495
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,810

which is in the well... who put any little ton in ten...

496
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,450
还不长记性  博迪  继续
Still short memory, Bertie, come on.

497
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,460
-翁  翁  -王  王
-A cow. A cow. - A king. A king.

498
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,860
只要能站在窗前掉嗓
Anyone who can shout vows in a open window

499
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,110
就能学会演讲

500
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,400
40秒  50秒

510
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,570
等很久了吗
You waiting long?

511
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,890
老天  真他妈冷
Christ, it's bloody freezing.

512
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,840
你怎么样
Where've you been?

513
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,080
-到处忙  -我也是

514
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,660
伊丽莎白得了肺炎
Elizabeth has pneumonia.

515
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,260
真可怜  她会康复的
I'm sorry. She'll recover.

516
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,210
父亲就难说了
Father won't.

517
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,860
我开车

-老家伙这是成心的  -成心要死吗
- Old bugger's doing this on purpose. - Dying?

519
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,200
提前离席
Departing prematurely...

520
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,230
恶化和威利斯(辛普森夫人)的关系
to complicate matters with Wallis.

521
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,800
得了吧  大卫  他都病这么久了
For heaven's sake, David. You know how long he's been ill.

522
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,760
威利斯是这么想的
Wallis explained.

523
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,000
她对这种事很明白
She's terribly clever about these things.

524
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,540
1912年6月11日于威斯敏斯特

bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June, 1912

526
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,290
乔治五世陛下宣布

-监国  -我  我不明白

- in the form of council of state. - I don't understand what you are talking about...

530
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,960
阁下  这是有关英国议会的决议
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.

531
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,350
授权我们代您行政

谢谢
Thank you.

537
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,600
感觉好点吗  阁下 
Feeling a little better, Sir?

538
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,750
没有  不好  太难受了
No. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.

539
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,160
你滑冰  滑冰去了吗

I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk,

543
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,220
也比不上拥抱和小醉
is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.

544
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,080
我们也不能小醉了
Nor making our own drowsies either,

545
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,500
因为最近酒会太多
as we've had to do far too often lately.

546
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,810
大卫  来吃晚饭
David, dinner?

547
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,460
我跟威利斯说话呢
I'm on with Wallis!

548
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,720
是博迪  不  不  这无所谓
Bertie. No. No, it's not important.

549
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,750
我不想当国王  真的
I don't want to! No!

550
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,840
晚点打给你  再见
I'll phone you later. Bye.

551
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,270
威利斯很想我
Wallis misses me terribly.

552
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,820
妈妈说你晚饭迟到了
Mama says you're late for dinner.

553
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,410
她忘了
She forgets

554
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,660
爸爸的钟都快半小时
Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast.

555
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,170
陛下怎样  他没在痛吧 
How is the King? I hope he is not in pain.

556
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,200
没有  阁下  陛下现在平静多了
No, no, sir. His Majesty is quieter now.

557
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,110
谢谢
Thank you.

558
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,130
大卫  你父王要在场
David, if your father were here,

559
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,290
不会容忍你迟到
tardiness would not be tolerated.

560
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,210
也不会容忍这样不愉快的事情发生
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.

561
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
殿下  如您所知  我很欣赏您
You know sir, I appreciate that

562
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,920
您与令尊相比
you are different from your father

563
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,010
目光远大  性格温和
both in outlook and temperament.

564
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,610
我想告诉您
I want you to know that

565
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,570
只要国王质疑您的行为
whenever the King questioned your conduct,

566
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,010
我都是站在您的立场上
I tried in your interest,

567
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:27,210
为您的利益着想
to present it in a most favourable light.

568
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,220
我相信您心里时刻想着'国王'的利益
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.

569
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,630
恐怕国王大限将至
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.

570
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,830
各位请慢用
Please continue.

571
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,440
我们将乔治弟兄
We commend our brother George

572
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,310
交予仁慈的天父  我们的造物主和救赎者
to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.

573
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,490
国王万岁
Long live the King.

574
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,730
我希望  我能做得和他一样好
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.

575
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,940
这到底是谁怎么了
What on earth was that?

576
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,260
可怜的威利斯  这下我陷入困境了
Poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!

577
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,220
来段莎士比亚的戏吧  爸爸
Time for a Shake, dad?

578
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,150
真的要吗
You sure?

579
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,470
来吧
Go on.

580
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,260
准备好猜谜
Put your thinking caps on.

581
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,590
我猜是《麦克白》
Bet its the Scottish Play.

582
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,390
不对  肯定《奥赛罗》  总是《奥赛罗》
No, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.

583
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,390
你害怕吗  不要怕
Are thou afeard. Be not afeard.

584
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,590
凯列班[莎士比亚剧《暴风雨》中角色]
Caliban!

585
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,060
老天  肯定是蒙对的
Oh! For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!

586
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,440
别听那书呆子的  继续  爸爸
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

587
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,520
岛上回响着各种声音  空气宜人
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs,

588
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,330
讨人喜欢  没有伤害
that give delight, and hurt not.

589
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,950
有时无数叮咚乐器声
Sometimes a thousand

590
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,560
在我耳边鸣响
twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears;

591
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,760
有时我酣睡醒来
and sometimes voices, that, if then

592
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,200
听见歌声  又使我沉沉睡去
I had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again:

593
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,020
好了  小机灵鬼  下一句是什么
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?

594
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,330
于是在梦里  我以为云要散了
And then, in dreaming, the clouds methought would open,

595
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,420
昭示财富将临  醒来之后
and show riches ready to drop upon me; that when I'm awake...

596
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,780
醒来之后  我含泪重又入梦
...when I waked, I cried to dream again.

597
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,630
这可真悲痛
It's such a sad thought.

598
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,800
肯定是我的下一个病人来早了
My next patient must be early.

599
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,950
你们得走了  小伙子们  对不起
You better go lads, I'm sorry.

600
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,950
马上来  克利福德
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

601
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,780
博迪  他们告诉我说你不来了
Bertie! They told me not to expect you.

602
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,990
节哀顺变
I am sorry about your father.

603
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,990
希望没有打扰您
I don't wish to intrude..

604
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,210
没有没有  请进
Oh no... Please come in.

605
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,770
我一直在练习  无论如何每天练一小时
I've been practising. One hour a day. In spite of everything.

606
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,490
你那儿怎么了
What's going on there?

607
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,400
不好意思  我在跟孩子们胡闹
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.

608
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,860
你今天想进行练习吗
Do you feel like working today?

609
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,230
柯蒂斯双翼飞机
A Curtis bi-plane.

610
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,180
我来准备点热牛奶
I'll put on some hot milk.

611
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,490
罗格  我喝点刺激的
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.

612
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,820
我父亲临终前我不在  这让我抱憾至今
I wasn't there for my father's death. Still makes me sad.

613
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,990
我可以想象
I can imagine so.

614
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,830
你父亲是干什么的
What did you father do?

615
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,420
他是个酿酒的
He was a brewer.

616
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,510
至少喝酒不要钱
At least there was free beer.

617
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,510
这杯来缅怀您父亲
Here's to the memory of your father.

618
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,780
后来  他们告诉我
I was informed, after the fact...

619
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,200
我父亲的临终遗言是
that my father's last words were:

620
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,800
博迪比其他几个兄弟加一起更勇敢
Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.

621
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,290
他没能直接对我说
He couldn't say that to my face.

622
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,150
我哥哥
My brother.

623
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,830
他怎么了
What about him?

624
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,940
试着唱出来
Try singing it.

625
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,260
什么
I'm sorry.

626
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,810
你会唱什么歌
What songs do you know?

627
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,260
唱歌
Songs?

628
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,560
对  唱歌
Yes songs.

629
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,760
《史瓦尼河》
"Swanee River"?

630
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,850
我喜欢那首歌
I love that song.

631
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,310
刚好也是我的最爱
Happens to be my favorite.

632
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,820
给我唱唱副歌部分
Sing me the chorus.

633
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,420
不  绝对不行
No. Certainly not.

634
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:50,350
我以前总想做模型  父亲不让
Always wanted to build models. Father wouldn't allow it.

635
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,690
他集邮  所以我们都得跟着集邮
He collected stamps. So we had to collect stamps.

636
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,850
如果您唱歌  就可以把这个做完  
You can finish that off. If you sing.

637
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,850
我可不想在这瞎哼哼
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.

638
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,270
你可以跟着我唱
You can with me.

639
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,390
因为你是个怪人
Because you're peculiar.

640
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,430
我就当你在夸我
I take that as a compliment.

641
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,690
按规矩来
Rules are rules.

642
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,640
我才不哼《史瓦尼河》
I'm not crooning "Swanee River".

643
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,290
那唱《康城赛马》
"Camptown Races" then.

644
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,990
我哥哥大卫告诉我  嘟哒
My brother David, he said to me, doo- dah

645
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,360
嘟哒  持续发音可以让您说话流利 
doo-dah... Continuous sound will give you flow.

646
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,190
现在大卫当国王了  会不会感觉很奇怪
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?

647
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,810
说实话
To tell the truth,

648
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,030
这是种解脱
it was a relief...

649
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,790
知道自己当不了国王
knowing I wouldn't be King.

650
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:05,250
可除非他有孩子  否则您就是下一任
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.

651
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,030
然后是您的女儿伊丽莎白继任
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.

652
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,130
医生啊医生  你是在胡说
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.

653
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,860
叫我莱昂内尔  看  你不结巴了
Lionel See? You didn'stammer.

654
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,710
我当然不结巴  我在唱歌
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!

655
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,640
作为奖励
Well, as a little reward,

656
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,060
您可以在支架上抹点胶水
you get to put some glue on these struts.

657
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,980
你儿子不会介意吧
Your boy, won't mind?

658
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,360
不  完全不会
No, not at all.

659
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:47,880
大卫和我曾经很亲密  你知道  年轻人嘛
David and I were very close. Young bucks... You know.

660
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,070
你们追一个姑娘
Did you chase the same girls?

661
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:03,410
安排引见的时候大卫总是很帮得上忙
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.

662
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:10,280
我们都受到了巴黎的Paulette的无微不至的照顾
We shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.

663
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,140
当然不是同一个时候
Not at the same time of course.

664
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,730
David嘲笑过你吗
Did David ever tease you?

665
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,150
他们都嘲笑过  Buh-buh-buh-博迪
Yes, they all did. Buh-buh-buh-Bertie?

666
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,760
父亲纵容他们  "别紧张
Father encouraged it. "Get it out,

667
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,220
孩子"  说这样能让我不结巴
boy!" Said it would make me stop.

668
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,370
他说"我害怕我父亲
Said that "I sas afraid of my father,

669
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:43,560
我的孩子必须也得怕我"
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."

670
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,230
你天生就是右撇子吗
Are you naturally right handed?

671
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:56,730
左撇子  我被迫改过来的  现在我习惯右手了
Left. I was punished. Now I use the right.

672
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,740
没错  这种情况在结巴中很常见
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.

673
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,430
还做过别的矫正吗
Anything other corrections?

674
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,620
X型腿
Knock knees.

675
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:15,170
从早到晚都得戴着金属夹板
Metal splints were made...worn night and day.

676
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,530
那一定很疼
That must have been painful.

677
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,800
疼死了  现在腿直了
Bloody agony. Straight legs now.

678
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,430
你同哪个家人最亲近
Who were you closest to in your family?

679
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:34,370
乳母  不是第一个  她喜欢大卫  讨厌我
Nannies. Not my first nanny, though..She loved David...hated me.

680
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,320
我们被带去
When we are presented to my

681
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:45,140
觐见父母的时候  她掐我
parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..

682
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:49,110
我就哭  然后被立刻
I'd cry and be handed back to her..

683
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,340
交回给她
immediately.

684
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,230
然后  她就
Then... she would...

685
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,590
唱出来
Sing it.

686
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:08,430
"然后她就不喂我"
"Then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."

687
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,500
三年之后我父母才发现
Took my parents three years to notice.

688
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:23,670
胃会出毛病一点都不奇怪  直到现在
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.

689
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,540
你弟弟约翰尼呢
What about your brother Johnny?

690
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,100
你和他亲近吗
Were you close to him?

691
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,930
约翰尼  好孩子
Johnny.. Sweet boy.

692
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,940
得了癫痫
Epilepsy...and...

693
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,430
他不一样
he was different.

694
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,530
13岁就去世了  不在公开场合出现
Died at 13, hidden from view.

695
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,300
他们告诉我这病不传染
I've been told it's not catching.

696
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,180
再来一杯吗
Do you want a top-up?

697
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,810
谢谢
Please.

698
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,620
莱昂内尔  你是第一个英国平民

700
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,320
同我真正交谈的

701
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:42,740
有时候  当我穿过街道  看见
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know,

702
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,470
那些平民盯着我
the common man staring at me,

703
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,570
我总为我对他的生活一无所知
I'm struck by how little I know of his life,

704
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,840
和他对我的生活一无所知而感到震惊
and how little he knows of mine.

705
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,940
谢谢
Thank you.

706
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,280
朋友就是倾诉对象

巴尔莫勒尔堡  苏格兰

709
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,330

- That's enough darling. - I have to keep doing this.

710
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,140
百年的橡树  为了开阔视野就这么砍了
One hundred year old oaks...removed to improve the view!

711
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,630
她以为她是谁
Who does she think she is!

712
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,770
不管怎样  我们必须对辛普森夫人礼貌
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.

713
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,020
你知道她管我叫"苏格兰胖厨子"吗
You know she calls me the Fat Scottish Cook?

714
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,420
你又不胖
You're not fat.

715
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,400
我快要发福了
I'm getting plump.

716
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,250
你不下厨
You seldom cook.

717
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,790
吃葡萄
I sifted seven.

718
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,070
闭嘴
Shut up!!

约克郡公爵与公爵夫人殿下驾到

721

我发现你改造了花园
You're making some changes to the garden, I see.

729
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,340
对  还没弄完 
Yes, I am. I am not quite finished.

730
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,230
别告诉我我表现不礼貌  丘吉尔先生
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.

731
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,630
恰恰相反  殿下  礼仪规定
On the contrary, your Royal Highness. Etiquette decrees

732
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:01,820
皇室成员应当被正式主人接待  在此  就应该是国王 
royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.

733
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:07,190
-而不是平民  -谢谢
- Not a commoner. - Thank you.

734
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,800
她是怎么迷住他的
What is her hold on him?

735
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,200
不知道
I have no idea.

736
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,230
显然她在上海国教教会
Apparently she has certain...skills,

737
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,880
学会了某些技巧
acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.

738
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:27,630
-大卫  -马上  亲爱的
- David.  - Just be a sec, darling.

739
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,380
大卫  我一直想见你
David, I've been trying to see you...

740
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,150
我忙得很
I've been terribly busy.

741
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,350
忙什么
Doing what?

742
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,630
当国王
Kinging.

743
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,320
当国王
Kinging

744
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,670
如今需要如履薄冰
is a precarious business these days.

745
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,100
俄罗斯的沙皇何在  德国的威廉皇帝何在
Where is the Russian Tsar? Where is Cousin Wilhelm?

746
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,740
你可真无趣
You're being dreary.

747
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:03,300
难道当国王要把桑德林汉姆夏宫80个臣属革职
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham

748
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,580
给威利斯买更多的珍珠
and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while

749
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,330
而此时共产主义者以席卷了整个欧洲大陆
there are people marching across Europe singing the Red Flag?

750
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,390
你别操心了  希特勒先生会解决这些
Stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.

751
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,230
那谁来解决希特勒先生
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?

752
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,880
那瓶该死的二三年陈酿在哪
Where's the bloody '23?

753
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,150
你甚至让那女人住进妈妈的套房
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?

754
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,110
妈妈没睡  不是吗
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?

755
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,610
这不好笑
That's not funny.

756
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,190
威利斯只喜欢最好的
Wallis likes the very best.

757
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,560
我不关心你晚上跟哪个女人暧昧
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night,

758
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,540
只要你白天履行身为国王的职责
as long as you show up for duty in the morning!

759
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,030
威利斯不只是跟我暧昧
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.

760
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,650
我们准备结婚了
We intend to marry.

761
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,430
你说什么
Excuse me?

762
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,820
她正在申请离婚
She's filing a petition for divorce.

763
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,910
老天
Good God.

764
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,360
你就不能给她间好房子  再给她封个爵位吗
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?

765
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,060
我不会让她做我的情妇的
I won't have her as my mistress.

766
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,200
大卫  教会不允许离婚
David, the Church does not recognise divorce

767
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,420
而你正是教会的领袖
and you are the head of the Church.

768
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,850
我难道一点权利也没有吗
Haven't I any rights?

769
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,790
你有很多特权
Many privileges...

770
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,130
不是一回事
Not the same thing.

771
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,610
那些平民都能为了爱情结婚
Your beloved common man may marry for love,

772
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,650
我怎么就不行
why not me?

773
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,580
你要是平民
If you were the common man,

774
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,140
又凭什么加冕为王
on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!

775
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,490
听起来你对我们这悲惨的宪法很有研究
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.

776
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,380
听起来你没研究
Sounds like you haven't.

777
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,000
这就是你的目的吗
Is that what this is all about?

778
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,490
从演讲课开始  反复练习
Brushing up.. hence the elocution lessons?

779
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,360
我是想
I'm trying to t-t...

780
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,940
想再多些听众吗  博  博  博迪
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-b-b-bertie?

781
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,720
别
D-don't ...

782
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,640
弟弟想把哥哥赶下王位
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..

783
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,180
还  还  还真老套
Pa pa.. ...Positively medieval.

784
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,270
-你上哪儿去了这么久  -你跟谁聊天呢  
- Where have you been all this time? - Who have you been talking to?

785
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:45,670
不关你的是
Never you mind.

786
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:53,090
你可真是个让人又爱又恨小家伙
Ahh..What a complicated lovely coon you are.

787
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,430
你喜欢就好
I try to be.

788
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,960
所有的努力都尽付东流了
All that work, down the drain.

789
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,800
我亲生的哥哥
My own brother...

790
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,410
我居然  居然对着他一个字都说不出来
I couldn't say.. I couldn't say a word to him in reply!

791
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,150
为什么你跟大卫说话比跟我说话结巴得多
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?

792
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,490
因为你收了一大笔钱听我说话
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!

793
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,590
博迪  我可不是陪聊的艺伎
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.

794
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,870
别说俏皮话了
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!

795
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,530
大卫怎么回事  会让你说不出话的
What is it about David that stops you speaking?

796
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,580
你是怎么回事  他妈成天
What is it about you, that bloody

797
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,440
没完没了纠结这个问题
well makes you want to go on about it, the whole bloody time.

798
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,550
粗鄙却很流利  你骂人的时候从不结巴
Vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.

799
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,490
滚蛋
Bugger off!

800
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,910
你只会骂这个吗
Is that the best you can do?

801
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,720
去你妈的  你这禽兽不如的混蛋
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

802
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,910
公共学校的道学先生都比你会骂人
A public school prig can do better than that.

803
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,560
日
Shit!

804
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,930
日  日  日  日
Shit, shit, shit! Shit!

805
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,930
看脏话从舌尖喷涌而出
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?

806
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:50,960
因为我生气了
Because I'm angry!

807
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,610
你会说那个F开头的词吗
You Know the f-word?

808
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,320
通奸
Fornication?

809
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,470
不是吧  博迪
Oh Bertie.

810
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,390
操  操  操  操
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!

811
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,130
没错  你看  多流利 
Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!

812
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:10,670
见鬼  见鬼  日  日
Bloody, bloody, bloody! Shit, shit,

813
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,690
日  混蛋  混蛋  操  操  奶子
Shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Tits.

814
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,600
爸  怎么了
Dad? What's going on?

815
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,270
抱歉  做作业去
Sorry. Finish your homework

816
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,740
我们很少见到你这一面
Well ..That's a side of you we don't get to see that often.

817
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,490
我们不该这样的  不能公开这样
No. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.

818
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,680
出去透透气吧
Let's get some air.

819
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,810
不  罗格  我认为这不是个好主意
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.

820
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,820
怎么了  什么让你这么沮丧
What's the matter? What's got you so upset?

821
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,100
罗格  说出来吓到你
Logue, you have no idea.

822
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:49,830
我哥哥迷恋一个结过两次婚的女人
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.

823
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:54,160
她正在申请离婚  而大卫决定要娶她
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.

824
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:59,250
巴尔的摩的威利斯・辛普森夫人
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.

825
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,910
这也没什么  以后就是巴尔的摩的威利斯皇后
That's all right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?

826
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,160
难以想象
Unthinkable.

827
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,890
他能这么做吗
Can he do that?

828
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,950
当然不能  但他决意如此
Absolutely not. But he's going to anyway.

829
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,790
所有事情全乱套了
All hell's broken loose.

830
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,290
他们不能偷偷的继续吗
Can't they carry on privately?

831
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,990
要是他们愿意就好了
If only they would.

832
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,030
你的立场是什么
Where does that leave you?

833
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,570
我知道我的本份
I know my place!

834
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,020
我会尽我一切所能
I'll do anything...

835
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,270
让我哥哥继续留在王位上
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.

836
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,690
你是认真的
Is it that serious?

837
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:38,120
也许做国王是你的本份
Your place may be on the throne.

838
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,940
我不是我哥哥的替代者
I am not an alternative to my brother.

839
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,510
如果你是国王  你会做的比大卫更好
If you had to you could outshine David...

840
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,210
别乱说
Don't talk about this!

841
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,490
这近乎叛国
That's bordering on treason.

842
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,460
我只是说你可以做国王  你能做到
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!

843
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,910
这是叛国
That is treason!

844
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,750
我只是想让你明白
I'm trying to get you to realise

845
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,110
你不用被恐惧控制
you need not be governed by fear.

846
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,960
够了
I've had enough of this!

847
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,060
你到底在怕什么
What're you so afraid of?

848
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,150
你这些讨厌的话
Your poisonous words!

849
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,800
那你为什么来找我
Why'd you come to me?

850
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,560
你可不是什么中产阶级人士
You are not some middle class bugger,

851
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,900
上了演讲课去跟别人胡扯
who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...

852
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:04,800
别对我的事指手画脚
Don't instruct me on my duties!

853
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:08,110
我是国王的儿子
I'm the son of a .... King...

854
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,690
国王的弟弟
the brother of a king.

855
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,210
你只是酿酒师没出息的儿子
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!

856
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,370
一个澳洲乡下来的暴发户
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!

857
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,370
你什么都不是
You're nobody.

858
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,920
疗程结束
These sessions are over!

859
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:04,380
花园入口  总统办公室  唐宁街十号

860
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,980
不是因为她是美国人  那不算什么
It's not because she's an American. That is the least of it.

861
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,080
是因为她是一个就要离婚两次的美国人
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American,

862
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,940
而国王作为英国国教的最高领袖
and the King as head of The Church of England...

863
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,200
不能娶一个离过婚的女人
can not marry a divorced woman.

864
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,300
阁下  我对此感到遗憾
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this,

865
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,990
根据苏格兰场的调查
according to Scotland Yard,

866
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:41,940
国王并不是辛普森夫人唯一爱人
the King has not always possess exclusive..Rights to Mrs. Simpson's... favours and affections,

867
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,520
她另有一个情人是个二手汽车商人  名叫推车盖
sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.

868
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:52,800
而且  还有传言说
In addition, it is also rumoured...

869
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,570
希特勒的大使  坎特・冯・李宾特洛普
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop,

870
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,670
每天给她送十七支康乃馨
sends her 17 carnations every day.

871
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,640
如果你哥哥继续无视内阁的忠告
Should your brother continue to

872
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:05,710
他必须逊位
ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.

873
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,780
否则内阁别无选择只能辞职
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.

874
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:10,850
首相
Prime Minister,

875
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:16,150
你要让这个国家没有内阁
you'd leave the country without a government?

876
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:20,460
一个国王该做他想做的
Does the King do what he wants,

877
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,660
还是该做他的人民想让他做的
or does he do what his people expect him to do?

878
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,640
怎么了  亲爱的
What's the matter, love?

879
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,240
我只是为一个病人苦恼
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.

880
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:41,890
这可不像你  怎么了
That isn't like you.. Why?

881
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,620
他很害怕  害怕他自己的影子
He's scared... He is afraid with his own shadow.

882
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,780
他们不就是为了这个来找你吗
Isn't that why they come to you?

883
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,400
这个人真的可以成就伟业
This fellow could be really somebody great,

884
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,340
但他反对我的说法
and he's fighting me.

885
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,740
可能他不想成就伟业
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.

886
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,570
可能那是你一厢情愿
Perhaps that's what you want.

887
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,100
我可能僭越了
I might have overstepped the mark.

888
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,860
去道歉
Apologize,

889
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,350
对你们两都好
do you both good.

890
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,550
很抱歉  罗格先生  公爵大人很忙
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.

891
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,320
我可以等  或者晚点再来
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.

892
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,850
我说了  公爵大人非常忙
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

893
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,140
谢谢
Thank you.

894
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:07,150
议会不会支持这桩婚姻的
The parliament will not support their marriage.

895
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,380
但还有其他原因  阁下 
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.

896
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,880
他不关心国家政策
He was careless with state papers.

897
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,440
他不承担义务  缺少决心
He lacked commitment and resolve.

898
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:17,180
还有人担心
There were those that worried

899
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,090
如果同德国开战  他是什么立场
where he would stand when war comes with Germany .

900
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,300
我们不会走到那一步吧
We're not coming to that?

901
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,230
绝对会  阁下 
Indeed we are, Sir.

902
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,830
鲍德温首相否认这点
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,

903
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:31,400
但希特勒的野心昭然若揭
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

904
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:35,130
与德国大战在即
War with Germany will come,

905
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,620
而我们需要一个带领我们团结一致的国王
and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.

906
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,810
我担心  此时我哥哥
I fear...my brother is not of

907
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,240
还没有看清形势
sound mind, at this time.

908
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,970
你想过赋予自己什么头衔吗
Have you thought what you will call yourself?

909
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,980
当然不能是阿尔伯特  阁下  太德国化了
Certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.

910
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,410
乔治怎么样
What about George?

911
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,260
用你父亲的头衔  乔治六世
After your father? George the sixth.

912
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:20,720
是个不错的传承  你不觉得吗
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?

913
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,900
大卫  谢天谢地
David! Thank God.

914
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:30,240
你看起来很累
You look exhausted!

915
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,100
你还撑得住吗
How are you bearing up?

916
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,890
博迪  我已经决定了
Bertie. The decision's been made.

917
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:39,820
我要逊位
I am going.

918
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:42,460
我无法接受
I cannot accept that.

919
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,010
你无论如何都不该做此决定
You are in no condition to make that decision.

920
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,290
恐怕没有别的办法
I'm afraid there's no other way.

921
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,810
我要娶她
I must marry her.

922
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,710
我已经决定了  抱歉
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

923
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,900
真是个糟糕的消息
That's a terrible thing to hear.

924
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:05,970
大卫  没人想你这么做  特别是我
David, nobody wants that. I least of all.

925
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:18,380
终于  我可以说我自己要说的话
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.

926
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,840
我于1936年12月10日签字证明
爱德华签署于景观台城堡

927
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:24,400
我从来没有想要隐瞒什么  但今天之前
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now,

928
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,000
根据宪法我不能发表任何讲话
it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.

929
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,500
几个小时之前  我卸下了
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty

930
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,350
作为一个国王和君主最后职责
as King and Emperor.

931
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,740
现在  将由我的弟弟约克公爵继位
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York

932
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:47,850
首先我表明对他效忠
my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.

933
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,260
全心全意忠顺
This I do with all my heart.

934
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,390
相信你们都知道
You all know the reasons

935
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,080
我宣布放弃王位的原因
which have impelled me to renounce the throne.

936
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,660
但是请你们相信我接下来的话
But you must believe me, when I tell you

937
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,460
如果没有我心爱女人的支持
I have found it impossible to carry the

938
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,700
我无法承担如此重任
heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..

939
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:14,940
也无法如我所愿的
as King as I would wish to do

940
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,730
卸除作为国王的职责
without the help and support of the woman I love...

941
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,190
同时  我希望你们知道
And I want you to know.

942
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,430
出于对我弟弟的了解
..This decision has been made less difficult to me

943
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,960
这个决定做的并不艰难
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

944
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,090
我弟弟一直致力于国家事务管理
with his long training in the public affairs of this country...

945
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,360
加上他的优秀品质
...and with his fine qualities...

946
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,110
必然能够即刻继位
...will be able to take my place forth with

947
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,850
不会让国家的前途和发展
without interruption or

948
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:47,350
受到任何的阻碍或伤害
injury to the life and progress of the empire."

949
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:52,130
登基会议  圣詹姆斯宫  1936年12月21日

950
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,150
我 在今天
I meet you at today...

951
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,080
在此情况下  和你们会面
in circumstances which are -

952
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,070
我保证你们会喜欢的
I'm sure you will love it.

953
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,190
谢谢宝贝  马鞍给我  玛格丽特
Thank you darling, saddles, Margret.

954
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,960
-好的  妈妈  -乖孩子
- Yes mom. - Good boy.

955
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,110
-妈妈这是威尔逊马鞍  -谢谢你
- Mama, here’s the Wilson saddle - Thank you.

956
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,630
别担心  我们一会就喂你吃东西
Don’t worry, we’ll get you food in a minute

957
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,420
妈妈  新家里有地方放小马吗
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?

958
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:53,870
当然有  小宝贝  宫殿里有很多房间 
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.

959
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,060
屈膝礼
Curtsey.

960
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,740
陛下
Your Majesty.

961
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,700
登基怎么样
How was it?

962
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:45,870
我在努力熟悉公文
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.

963
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,450
鲍德温先生来的信件  我一个字都没看懂
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.

964
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,980
大卫的财务状况
David's finances.

965
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:09,810
圣诞演说
The Christmas broadcast -

966
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:12,050
我觉得这是个错误
I think that might be a mistake.

967
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,050
别担心了
Don't worry about that.

968
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,140
还有加冕典礼计划
Plans for the Coronation -

969
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:30,050
这或许是个更大的错误
I think that's an even bigger mistake.

970
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,900
我不是国王
I'm not a King.

971
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,860
我只是个海军军官
I'm a naval officer.

972
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:42,810
我只知道怎么做海军军官
It's the only thing I know.

973
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,550
我不属于这里  我不是国王
I'm not here. I'm not a King.

974
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,510
对不起
I'm sorry.

975
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,280
对不起
I'm sorry.

976
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,280
别  别这样
Please...please.

977
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,150
亲爱的  亲爱的
Dear, dear man...

978
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:09,740
你知道吗  我两次拒绝你的求婚
You know... I refused your first two marriage proposals,

979
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,450
不是因为我不爱你
not because I didn't love you,

980
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,930
而是因为我不能忍受皇室的生活
but because I couldn't bear the idea royal life.

981
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,700
不能忍受四处出访和公共责任
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties,

982
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,360
生活不再属于我们自己
a life that no longer was really to be my own.

983
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:26,860
不过后来我想
But then I thought...

984
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,580
他是结巴太好了
he stammers so beautifully...

985
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,370
大家会放过我们
they'll leave us alone.

986
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,400
支持国王  上帝保佑他

987
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,750
等国王来道歉  那要等很久
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.

988
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,230
恐怕我们迟到了一会
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

989
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,310
这就是我家  莫特尔去打桥牌了
This is home. Myrtle's at bridge.

990
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:16,470
我让孩子们都出去
I've made sure the boys are out.

991
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,000
太好了
It's lovely.

992
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,870
非常好
Absolutely lovely.

993
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:22,250
我能坐这吗
May I sit down?

994
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,310
当然可以
Yes, of course.

995
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,940
喝点茶吧  夫人
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?

996
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,260
好的  我自己来就行
Yes. I'll help myself.

997
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:35,740
你们聊吧
Off you go...

998
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:38,180
还是需要我强迫你们
Or must I knock your heads together?

999
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,790
这是我欠你的一先令
Here's your shilling,

1000
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,040
我明白
I understand...

1001
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,810
你之前的意思了  罗格
what you were trying to say, Logue.

1002
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,660
我做错了
I went about it the wrong way.

1003
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:02,810
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1004
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:06,530
所以  我来了
Now here I am.

1005
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,920
民众准备好
Is the nation ready for

1006
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,770
听我的两分钟无声广播了吗
two minutes of radio silence?

1007
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,500
所有结巴都害怕自己又回到原点
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.

1008
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,560
我不会让这个情况发生的
I don't let that happen.

1009
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,360
如果我做的不好
If I fail in my duty...

1010
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,830
大卫就会回来
David could come back.

1011
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,580
我看到那些布告了
I've seen the placards

1012
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,720
天佑吾王
God save Our King!?

1013
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,130
他们指的不是我
They don't mean me.

1014
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,930
历史上每一位君主的继任
Every other monarch in history

1015
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:42,720
都是在前任去世或者命不久矣的情况下
succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.

1016
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:50,750
而我的前任不仅活着  还活得很好
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.

1017
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,010
真是一团糟
What a bloody mess!

1018
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,650
我甚至不能发表一次圣诞演说
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.

1019
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,350
像您父亲曾经那样
Like your Dad used to do?

1020
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,740
没错
Precisely.

1021
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,020
他已经不在了
He's not here anymore.

1022
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,940
不  他还在  就在我给你的一先令上
Yes he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.

1023
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,250
随便都能送人
Easy enough to give away.

1024
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,150
您不用总带着他的影子
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.

1025
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,590
或者你哥哥的影子
Or your brother.

1026
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,540
您无需害怕那些
You don't need to be afraid of

1027
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:26,520
您五岁时候害怕的东西
the things as you were afraid of when you were five.

1028
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:35,120
您已经独立自主  博迪
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

1029
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,550
是吗
Am I?

1030
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,120
你的脸会印在下一批硬币上  哥们
Your face is next, mate.

1031
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:45,520
莱昂纳尔
Lionel?

1032
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,700
莫特尔
Myrtle!

1033
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:50,150
-没事吧  -没事
- Is it alright? - Yes.

1034
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,750
博迪  过来
Bertie, come here.

1035
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,280
-你还好吧  罗格  -还好
- Are you alright, Logue? - Yes.

1036
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,100
-要出去吗  -相信我  这很重要
- Shall we go through? - Trust me. It's important.

1037
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,780
怎么了
What is it?

1038
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,470
-陛  陛  -第一次叫陛下就好
- Your... Your... - It's your Majesty? The first time.

1039
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,470
之后可以叫夫人  别读错了
After that, it's Ma'am,As in Ham, not Malm as in Palm.

1040
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,050
我没跟她讲过我们的事
I haven't told her about us.

1041
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,200
先坐下  放松
Sit down, relax.

1042
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:24,170
你丈夫叫我丈夫博迪
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie

1043
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,210
而我丈夫叫你丈夫莱昂纳尔
and my husband calls your husband Lionel.

1044
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,360
我想你应该不会叫我莉斯
I trust you won't call me Liz.

1045
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:33,210
陛下  你可以叫我罗格夫人
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.

1046
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,300
见到你很高兴  罗格夫人
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.

1047
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:39,640
罗格  我们不能一直站这
Logue, we can't stand here all day.

1048
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:42,640
我们可以的  我得等个合适的时候
Yes we can. Look, I need to wait for the right moment.

1049
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,940
罗格你这样像胆小鬼
Logue, you're being a coward!

1050
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:45,840
你说的没错
You're damn right.

1051
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,560
出去吧  伙计
Get out there, man!

1052
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,620
嗨  亲爱的莫特尔
Hello, Myrtle darling!

1053
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,860
你回来早了  我相信你们已经见过面了
You're early. I believe you two have met!

1054
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,990
但是  我想你应该还没见过
But I didn't think, you know...

1055
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:03,160
国王乔治六世
King George the Sixth.

1056
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:03,880
很高兴见到你
It's very nice to meet you.

1057
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,770
陛下们要留下吃晚饭吗
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?

1058
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,770
我们也想留下来  谢谢你的好意
We would love to, such a treat, but alas...

1059
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,780
但是有约在身  真遗憾
a previous engagement. What a pitty.

1060
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:37,500
-主教大人  -欢迎您  陛下
- Archbishop. - Welcome, your Majesty.

1061
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,350
多么壮观的改造  阁下
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.

1062
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,380
请允许我们继续准备
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.

1063
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:51,880
现在请允许我为您介绍仪式的过程
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.

1064
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:00,850
我们从西门进来  然后到中殿
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.

1065
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:04,000
我听说您所有讲话
I see you all your

1066
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,780
都会被广播  主教大人
pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1067
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:12,080
是的  无线电就像潘多拉的盒子
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.

1068
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:16,400
我恐怕还得批准新闻摄影的拍摄
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.

1069
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,920
我会亲自监督剪辑的
The product of which I shall personally edit.

1070
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,610
真是毫不犹豫
Without momentary hesitation.

1071
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:27,530
这是哈里大街的罗格医生
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.

1072
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,650
他是我的语言治疗师
He's my speech therapist.

1073
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,760
-大人  -如果知道
- Your Grace. - Had I known

1074
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,010
陛下您在寻医
that Your Majesty was seeking assistance

1075
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,610
我一定会亲自给您推荐人选的
I should've made my own recommendation.

1076
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:40,320
罗格医生
Dr. Logue...

1077
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:43,240
会  会出席加冕礼
will be attending the Coronation.

1078
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,000
我可以去跟教长说一下
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean,

1079
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,800
但会很困难
but it was extremely difficult.

1080
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:55,370
我想让他坐到国王的包厢里
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.

1081
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,900
但那是给您的家人准备的  阁下
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.

1082
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,850
这正是为何坐那里合适
That is why it's suitable.

1083
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,160
大人如果你不介意的话
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace,

1084
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,060
我们需要场地准备
we need the premises.

1085
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:08,640
老兄  这可是威斯敏斯特教堂
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!

1086
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,800
教堂必须为陛下准备
The Church must prepare his Majesty.

1087
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:13,640
我的准备也一样重要
My preparations are equalized in important

1088
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,840
如果你不介意的话  最好清场
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.

1089
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,820
我也希望这样  大人
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1090
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:29,770
今晚教堂就交由陛下使用
I shall place the Abbey at Your majesty's disposal...

1091
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,100
容我告退  陛下
this evening. Your Majesty.

1092
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:57,210
看  他又来了
Look, he comes again.

1093
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:56,300
我不敢相信我正走在
I can't believe I'm walking on

1094
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,050
乔叟  韩德尔和狄更斯的墓上
tombs of Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1095
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,220
准备好了吗  我们开始吧
Everything alright? Let's get cracking.

1096
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:19,160
我不是来这彩排的  罗格医生
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.

1097
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:23,830
叫我莱昂纳尔
Call me Lionel.

1098
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:31,250
是啊  你一直  都不管自己叫医生
True, you... never... called yourself "Doctor."

1099
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:35,690
是我这么叫你
I did that... for you.

1100
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:48,060
没有培训  没有文凭  没有资质
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.

1101
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:52,470
只有一身的胆量
Just a... great deal of nerve.

1102
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,180
这是秘密审问吗
The star chamber inquisition, is this?

1103
01:24:56,230 --> 01:25:01,640
你要求信任  和充分的平等
You asked trust and... total equality.

1104
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,420
博迪  我听了你在温布利的演讲
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.

1105
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:05,750
我当时在场
I was there.

1106
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:08,170
我的儿子劳里说  爸爸
My son Laurie said dad,

1107
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,990
你能不能帮帮这个可怜人
do you think you could help that poor man??

1108
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,610
怎么帮  就凭一个失败的演员
What, as a failed actor!?

1109
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,410
这是事实  我不是一个医生
It's true, I'm not a doctor,

1110
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,120
而且  我确实当过演员
and yes I acted a bit,

1111
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,350
我在俱乐部朗诵  在学校教演讲
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.

1112
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,470
当大战来临
When the Great War came,

1113
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,900
我们的士兵从前线回来
all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front,

1114
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,740
很多人得了炮弹休克症
a lot of them shell-shocked,

1115
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,700
无法开口说话
unable to speak

1116
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,140
有人跟我说  莱昂纳尔  你这么会演讲
somebody said, Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.

1117
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:37,440
你能帮帮这些可怜的人吗
Do you think you can possibly help these poor buggers.?

1118
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:46,530
我做了肌肉治疗练习放松
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation,

1119
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:48,930
但是我知道要治好还需要更多
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1120
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,550
这些可怜的年轻人害怕的大叫
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear,

1121
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,230
却没有人倾听
no-one was listening to them.

1122
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,870
我的工作就是让他们相信自己的声音
My job was to give them faith in their own voice

1123
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:57,680
让他们知道有个朋友在用心倾听
and let them know that a friend was listening.

1124
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,090
博迪  这一定让你想到自己
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.

1125
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,100
你说得自己真高尚
You give a very noble account of yourself.

1126
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,250
你去打听  这都是事实
Make inquiries. It's all true.

1127
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:12,880
我都打听过了
Inquiries have been made!

1128
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,920
你不知道多少人在找我的麻烦
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?

1129
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:20,660
我为你做担保
I vouched for you

1130
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,850
可你却连文凭都没有
and you have no... credentials.

1131
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,970
可我成功治好了很多人
But lots of success!

1132
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:27,480
我拿不出证书给你看
I can't show you certificate -

1133
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,260
那时没有什么培训机构
there was no training then.

1134
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,140
我会的一切都来自于经验
Everything I know I know from experience,

1135
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:34,670
是那场战争  给我的经验
and that war... was some experience.

1136
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,600
我的牌子上写的是  L・ 罗格  治疗言语缺陷
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."

1137
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:42,350
没有医生两个字
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.

1138
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,910
把我关进监狱好了
Lock me in the Tower.

1139
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,070
如果可以我早就关了
I would if I could!

1140
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,970
-以什么罪名  -欺诈罪
- On what charge? - Fraud!

1141
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,840
战争一触即发
With war looming,

1142
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:57,110
你让一个不能说话的国王坐上王位
you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.

1143
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,460
你毁了我的家庭幸福
You destroyed the happiness of my family.

1144
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,890
所有这一切都是为了欺骗
All for the sake of ensnaring a star...

1145
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:07,360
一个你根本就无法救治的明星病人
patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!

1146
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:14,020
就像疯子国王乔治三世
It'll be like mad... King George the Third,

1147
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:21,550
我就是口吃的疯子国王乔治
there'll be mad King George the stammerer,

1148
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:28,410
在人民最需要的时候让他们失望
who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!

1149
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:31,600
你这是干什么  起来  你不能坐在这儿  快起来
What're you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! Get up!

1150
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:32,860
为什么不能  这就是把椅子 
Why not? It's a chair.

1151
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:36,220
不  那不只是一把椅子  那是  那是
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...

1152
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,160
那是圣爱德华的王座
That is Saint Edward's Chair!

1153
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,820
有人随便在上面刻了自己的名字
People have carved their names on it.

1154
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:42,500
这把椅子是让历任国王和女王
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen---

1155
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:44,400
下面还有块大石头
It's held in a place by a large rock!

1156
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,730
那是来自斯昆的石头
That's the Stone of Scone yard,

1157
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,110
-你亵渎一切  -你相信这套吗
- you are trivialising everything. - You believe such bollocks.

1158
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,000
你亵渎一切
You're trivialising everything!

1159
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,810
我可不在乎有多少...
I don't care how many royal...

1160
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,670
-听我说  听我说  -...皇族蠢货坐在这椅子上
- Listen to me. Listen to me! - ...arse have sat in this chair.

1161
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,680
-听我说  -听你说  凭什么
- Listen to me... ! - Listen to you?! By what right?

1162
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:55,690
神授王权  我是你的国王
By the divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!

1163
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,370
不  你不是  你自己告诉过我
No you're not! You told me so yourself.

1164
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,540
你说过你并不想做国王
You said you didn't want it.

1165
01:27:58,590 --> 01:27:59,940
那我为什么还要浪费时间听你说话
Why should I waste my time listening to you?

1166
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,080
因为我有权被倾听
Because I have a right to be heard!

1167
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:03,530
-听你说什么  -我有权说话
- Heard as what?! - I HAVE A VOICE!!!

1168
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,980
没错
Yes you do.

1169
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,560
你有毅力
You have such a perservance,

1170
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,800
博迪  你是我见过的最勇敢的人
Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.

1171
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,530
你会成为一个非常好的国王
And you'll make a bloody good king.

1172
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:35,430
这到底是怎么了
What on earth's going on,

1173
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:37,680
-陛下  -一切正常  主教大人
- Sir? - It's quite alright, Archbishop.

1174
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,150
罗格先生  我要告诉你
Mr Logue, you must know

1175
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:41,620
我已经找了一个非常有资质的
that I found a replacement English specialist

1176
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:43,980
英国专家来替代你
with impeccable credentials.

1177
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,690
你的工作即将结束
Hence, your services will no longer be required.

1178
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:47,880
你说什么
I'm sorry?

1179
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,570
陛下的工作是咨询并听取建议
Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.

1180
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:54,240
而您没有咨询  但刚得到建议
And you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.

1181
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:58,140
我来给你提个建议
Now I advise you:

1182
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:02,820
在这  种私人问题上  我会自己做决定
In this personal matter I will make my own decision.

1183
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,960
我是为加冕国王的安危着想
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.

1184
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:13,010
我很感激  主教大人  但这是我自己的事情
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!

1185
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,010
恕我告退
Your humble servant.

1186
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:25,950
谢谢  博迪
Thank you Bertie.

1187
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:31,130
我们排练吧  坐在您的位子上 
Shall we rehearse? Come on upon your purge.

1188
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:42,560
当您和伊丽莎白从西门进来之后
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door,

1189
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:46,460
您将听到赞歌  "我很高兴他们对我说"
you'll be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said onto me"

1190
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,460
其实您也没那么高兴
Actually you won't be that glad,

1191
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,460
因为他们会在那里唱很久
because they sing it for a very long time.

1192
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,230
然后  你的朋友
Then your friend

1193
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:56,430
主教大人会面向你走上台阶
the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you

1194
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:01,930
说  "陛下  您愿意宣誓吗"
and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The oath"

1195
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:05,530
-"我愿意"  -你当然愿意
- "I am willing" - Course you are!

1196
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,150
我得去最后面的位子听下效果
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats

1197
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,400
保证连您的老保姆也能听到
so even your old nanny can hear.

1198
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,630
"您愿意根据当地习俗统治不列颠  爱尔兰
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1199
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:21,130
加拿大  澳大利亚  以及新西兰的人民吗"
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs"

1200
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:23,930
"我在此庄严承诺"
"I solemnly promise so do so."

1201
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:25,730
大点声  我在后面听不到
Louder! I can't hear you up the back.

1202
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:28,740
"我在此庄严承诺"
"I solemnly promise so do so."

1203
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,340
很好
Very good!

1204
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:33,750
您愿意以仁爱之心用法律和公正的判断
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy,

1205
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,980
来行使您的权利吗
to be executed in all your judgements?"

1206
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,000
"我愿意"  "我愿意"
"I will." "I WILL!"

1207
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,730
之后会有很长一段是关于坚持信念的
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith,

1208
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:45,430
继续的也是废话  废话  废话  直到你最后说
goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. To which you finally say...

1209
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:50,730
"我在这里所承诺的事
"The things which I have...herebefore promised,

1210
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:53,490
我会一如既往的履行"
I will perform and keep."

1211
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:55,410
上帝保佑
So help me God

1212
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,590
你要说的就是这些  只有四句
And that's all you'll say. Four short responses,

1213
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,540
亲吻那本书  在誓约上签字  你就是国王了
kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.

1214
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,880
很简单
Easy.

1215
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:20,010
您差点把王冠戴反了  主教大人
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!

1216
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,350
有人把标志王冠反面的线弄掉了  陛下
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.

1217
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:28,310
别把线弄掉  主教大人
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.

1218
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:31,220
主教先生  我们看不到爸爸了
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1219
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:39,120
非常好  非常好  主教大人
Very good, very good. Archbishop.

1220
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,690
我希望国王和王后陛下对结果满意
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.

1221
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:46,920
现在你可以把机器关掉了
You could switch that machine off now.

1222
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,010
不要  等等  继续放
No, wait, keep going.

1223
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,610
请坐下吧  主教大人
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

1224
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:14,410
爸爸  爸爸  他在说什么
Papa? Papa, what's he saying?

1225
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,850
不知道  但他似乎说的很好
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.

1226
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:41,340
陛下  我今天来见您
Sir, I have asked to see you today

1227
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:46,340
是为了向您辞去首相的职务
in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.

1228
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,150
听你这么说我很难过  鲍德温先生
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.

1229
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:55,270
内维尔・张伯伦会接替首相之职
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.

1230
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:58,880
我在一个重大问题上做了错误的决定
It's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.

1231
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,960
很难想象  这个世界上
I have found it impossible to believe

1232
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,490
竟然有像希特勒这样
that there is any man in the World

1233
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:11,440
如此缺乏道德感
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1234
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:15,820
而这个世界也很可能会
but the world may be hurled for

1235
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:19,850
再次陷入战争灾难的深渊
a second time into the abyss of destructive War.

1236
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:24,550
一直以来丘吉尔都是对的
Churchill was right all along.

1237
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:27,350
这就是希特勒的野心
This was always Hitler's intention.

1238
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:32,850
在这危急时刻离开您  我感到很抱歉
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.

1239
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,450
国王陛下  我很担心
I am very much afraid Sir,

1240
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:41,870
您将面临最大的考验
that your greatest test is yet to come.

1241
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:53,030
我在唐宁街10号的内阁会议室发表广播(1939年9月3日)
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.

1242
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,540
今天早晨  英国驻柏林大使
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin

1243
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:02,620
提交了一份德国政府的最后声明
handed the German Government a final note

1244
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:08,450
如果我们在11点之前没有得到知会
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 oclock

1245
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,760
既是表示德国已经做好准备
that they were prepared at once

1246
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,770
立即从波兰撤军
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1247
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,720
德英两国随即进入战争状态
a state of war would exist between us.

1248
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,140
我要告诉你们的是
I have to tell you now

1249
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:24,330
我们并未收到任何知会
that no such undertaking has been received,

1250
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,610
因此  德英两国已经进入战争状态
and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.

1251
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,790
最后  陛下  这是您的演讲稿  6点开始直播
At last Sir, here is your speech. You are on air at six.

1252
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:46,220
时间不超过9分钟
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.

1253
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:49,060
措辞经过充分推敲
The wording is fully approved.

1254
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:52,340
首相先生也将在广播中发表演说
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast

1255
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:54,760
这次广播将在全国
which will go out live across the Nation,

1256
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,780
整个帝国及军队播放
the Empire and to our Armed Forces.

1257
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:58,780
马上把罗格叫过来
Get Logue here immediately.

1258
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:15,890
-那是防空气球  -是呀
- There's the barrage balloons. - Yes.

1259
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:20,030
他们动作倒是挺快
They got them up there quickly.

1260
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:35,140
我们是不是停车找掩体躲避
Should we pull over and find shelter?

1261
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,090
不  继续开  没事的
No, go straight on. We'll be alright

1262
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,620
-您好  先生  -我是莱昂纳尔・罗格
- Yes. Sir? - Lionel Logue.

1263
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:51,590
哈特利大人正在等我  这是我的儿子劳里
Major Hartley's expecting me. This is my son Laury.

1264
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:01,410
-谢谢  劳里  -一切顺利  爸爸
- Thank you, Laurie. - Good luck, Dad.

1265
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,660
-这是国王的演讲稿  -谢谢  先生
- The King's Speech. - Thank you, Sir.

1266
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:12,590
现在离直播还有大约40分钟
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.

1267
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:17,150
非常感谢  谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1268
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:23,490
"我们前方也许是黑暗"
"there may be dark days ahead, and..."

1269
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,910
再来一次
Try again.

1270
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:33,710
"我们前方也许是黑暗"
"there may be dark days ahead, and..."

1271
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:36,850
在卡住的地方停顿
Turn the hesitations into pauses,

1272
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,660
然后自言自语说  天佑吾王
and say to yourself, God save the King

1273
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:42,210
这句话我经常说  可明显没人听
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.

1274
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:45,680
长的停顿很好  在重大场合更显庄重
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.

1275
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:48,580
那我就是最为庄重的国王
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.

1276
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:53,010
莱昂纳尔  如果我是国王  权利何在 
And Lionel, if I am to be King... where is my power?

1277
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:56,460
我能  我能组织内阁吗
Can I... Can I form a Government?

1278
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:01,080
我能  我能征税或宣战吗  不能
Can I... Can I levy a tax or declare a war? No!

1279
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:03,380
而我是所有职权的代表  为什么
Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why?

1280
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:09,080
因为民众认为我讲话是为了他们
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.

1281
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,680
但我却不善于讲话
Yet I cannot speak!

1282
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,920
我们从头再来一遍  "在这一庄严时刻"
Let's take it all again from the top. "In this grave hour"

1283
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:31,590
"在这一庄严时刻"  日  日  日
"In this grave hour" fuck fuck fuck

1284
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,900
也许是我们有史以来最生死攸关的时刻  混蛋  操  操
perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit

1285
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:38,600
我要向所有家庭
I send to every household of my...

1286
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:43,740
就算我唱着说  "人"也总是很难发音 
You see "P" Is always difficult, even when I'm singing.

1287
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:46,940
遇到"人"的时候用"一个人"代替
Bounce onto it "A-peoples", not "People".

1288
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:50,370
"一个人"   "...大英人民...
"A-peoples" ...household of my

1289
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:54,640
的所有家庭  无论是在国内还是海外"
peoples both at home and overseas..."

1290
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,250
很好
Beaut.

1291
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:58,160
"传达这一消息"
...this message, doo-dah,

1292
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,510
"怀着同样的深刻情感"
"...spoken with the same depth of feeling," doo-dah-dey,

1293
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,510
"对你们每个人说  就好像我在"  操  日  混蛋
"...for each one of you as if I were able to" shit fuck bugger

1294
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,570
和你们面对面交流
cross your threshold and speak to you"

1295
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:12,460
你要在脑子里想  我有权力要你们都听到
In your head, now: I have a right to be bloody well heard!?

1296
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:16,210
都听到  都听到  都听到我说话
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!

1297
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:19,210
来段华尔兹  动起来  动作流畅 
Now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.

1298
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:24,950
"对大多数人来说  在有生之年  我们第二次..."
"For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at..."

1299
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:28,670
-"我们"要停顿一下  -莱昂纳尔  我做不来
- We are...?Take a pause. - Lionel, I can't do this.

1300
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,760
博迪  你可以的
Bertie, you can do it.

1301
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,380
-再看一下最后一段  -博迪  时间到了
- Have a look at the last paragraph. - Bertie, it's time.

1302
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:52,420
-主教大人  -国王陛下
- Archbishop. - Your Majesty.

1303
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,210
这是个伟大的时刻  陛下
A great moment, Sir.

1304
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:01,890
-首相  -国王陛下
- Prime Minister. - Your Majesty.

1305
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:08,270
我们又见面了  真快
Nice to see you again, so soon.

1306
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:19,550
你能来很好  我相信你刚度过了繁忙的一天
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.

1307
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:21,530
希望我们不会再被那些
Let's hope we have no more

1308
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:23,930
该死的警报声打断  阁下
interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.

1309
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,110
或者那些可怜的小狗们
Or the wretched dogs.

1310
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:32,550
-恭喜你荣任海军大臣  -谢谢国王陛下
- Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. - Your Majesty.

1311
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:39,580
很长一段路
The long walk.

1312
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,870
一切顺利  陛下
Good luck, Sir.

1313
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,160
我也害怕这种仪器
I too dread this apparatus.

1314
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,790
您知道吗  我也曾口吃
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.

1315
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:56,310
-没听说过  -家族秘密  舌头打结
- I didn't. - Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1316
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,740
手术风险很大
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.

1317
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:03,340
最终我把它变成长处了
I eventually made an asset of it.

1318
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:08,660
-谢谢  丘吉尔先生  -陛下请
- Thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.

1319
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,890
亲爱的
Darling.

1320
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:14,110
-还有多久  罗格  -不到3分钟  陛下
- How long, Logue? - Just under three minutes, Sir.

1321
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:47,170
-伍德先生  -祝您好运  陛下
- Mr Wood. - Good luck, Your Majesty.

1322
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,860
伍德先生
Mr Wood.

1323
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,280
-你会被授予奖章  罗格  -拿来当杯垫
- You'll be decorated, Logue. - I made it cosy.

1324
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:59,190
来点新鲜空气
Some fresh air.

1325
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:02,030
来吧  亲爱的
There you are, Darling.

1326
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:07,360
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve

1327
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,300
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.

1328
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:12,030
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
I've a sieve of sifted thistles

1329
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,630
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...

1330
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,680
博迪  亲爱的  别忘了开关
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!

1331
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:19,980
记住红灯闪烁4次之后
Remember the red light will blink four times

1332
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:22,210
我会叫他们关灯
and then I've asked them to turn it off,

1333
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:23,780
因为不想
because we don't want that

1334
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:26,360
让那只邪恶的眼睛一直盯着你
evil eye staring at you all the way through.

1335
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:28,310
还有1分钟  陛下
One minute, sir.

1336
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:33,050
我肯定你会做得很好
I am sure you will be splendid.

1337
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:46,600
40秒  陛下
Fourty seconds, Sir.

1338
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:53,270
罗格 不管结果如何
Logue, however this turns out,

1339
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,700
我都不知道该如何感谢你
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.

1340
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:03,350
授爵行吗
Knighthood?

1341
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:09,570
20秒
Twenty seconds.

1342
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:20,340
抛开一切  只要对着我说话就好
Forget everything else and just say it to me.

1343
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:23,030
对着我说  就像对朋友说
Say it to me, as a friend.

1344
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:09,170
在这一庄严时刻
In this grave hour,

1345
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:21,340
也许是我们有史以来生死攸关的时刻
perhaps the most fateful in our history,

1346
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:33,000
我要向大英人民的每个家庭
I send to every household of my peoples,

1347
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,950
无论是在国内
both at home

1348
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,060
还是海外
and overseas

1349
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,950
传达这一消息
this message

1350
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:01,560
和你们一样 
spoken with the same depth of feeling

1351
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,370
怀着同样深刻的感受
for each one of you

1352
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:09,280
就好像我在和你们
as if I were able to cross your threshold

1353
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,930
面对面交谈
and speak to you myself.

1354
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,260
对我们大多数人来说  有生之年
For the second time in the lives of most of us

1355
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:27,790
我们再一次面临  面临战争
we are at... at war.

1356
01:44:32,290 --> 01:44:36,260
一次有一次
Over and over again

1357
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:40,580
我们竭尽全力
we have tried to find

1358
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:51,250
想为我们和那些如今成为敌人的人之间的差异
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves

1359
01:44:52,670 --> 01:45:00,300
找到和平的解决办法
and those who are now our enemies.

1360
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,530
但终是突然
But it has been in vain.

1361
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:11,120
我们被迫面临冲突
We have been forced into a conflict.

1362
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:17,160
因为我们是被号召去挑战一种信条
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle

1363
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,800
这种信条如果获胜
which, if it were to prevail,

1364
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,120
将是对全世界文明秩序的
would be fatal to any civilized order

1365
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:27,800
致命打击
in the world.

1366
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:30,990
这种信条
Such a principle,

1367
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:36,320
剥除所有伪装
stripped of all disguise,

1368
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:40,360
无疑是一种简单的
is surely the mere

1369
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:50,250
原始信条  那就是强权即真理
primitive doctrine that might is right.

1370
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:57,010
为了我们所珍惜的一切
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear,

1371
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:08,220
毫无疑问  我们不应拒绝迎接这种挑战
it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.

1372
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:18,390
为了这个崇高的目标  在此
It is to this high purpose that I now call

1373
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:26,220
我号召海内外所有的大英臣民
my people at home and my peoples across the seas,

1374
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:31,590
将我们事业当作自己的事业
who will make our cause their own.

1375
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:38,130
请你们保持镇静和坚定
I ask them to stand calm and firm,

1376
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:43,140
在此危难之时团结一致
and united in this time of trial.

1377
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,570
任务十分艰巨
The task will be hard.

1378
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:51,560
我们前方也许是黑暗
There may be dark days ahead,

1379
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:59,370
而战争也将不再局限于战场
and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.

1380
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:05,060
但我们只能做我们认为正确的事情
But we can only do the right as we see the right

1381
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:14,070
并向上帝虔诚祈祷
and reverently commit our cause to God.

1382
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:24,070
如果我们所有人都能坚定信念
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it,

1383
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:29,270
那么  有上帝的庇佑
then, with God's help,

1384
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:34,880
我们将取得胜利
we shall prevail.

1385
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,820
非常好  博迪
Very good, Bertie.

1386
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,180
你说"和"还是有点结巴
You still stammered on the "w"?

1387
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:13,930
总得结巴几下  他们才知道是我
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.

1388
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:22,320
恭喜您  国王陛下  一次真正的广播
Congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.

1389
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:23,920
谢谢  伍德先生
Thank you, Mr Wood.

1390
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,160
恭喜您  国王陛下
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1391
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:32,890
-恭喜您  陛下  -谢谢
- Congratulations, your Majesty. - Thank you.

1392
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:45,320
好了
Ready.

1393
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:47,710
-行吗  -很好
- Good? - Perfect.

1394
01:48:49,450 --> 01:48:53,980
你的首次战争演讲  恭喜
Your first war time speech. Congratulations.

1395
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:59,330
我还应做的更好
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.

1396
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:05,010
谢谢你  罗格
Thank you, Logue.

1397
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:17,950
干得好  我的朋友
Well done, my friend.

1398
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,930
谢谢您  国王陛下
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1399
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:38,590
我知道你行的
I knew you'd be good.

1400
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:50,590
谢谢你  莱昂纳尔
Thank you, Lionel.

1401
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:55,770
继续吧
Onwards?

1402
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:58,490
恭喜您  陛下
Congratulations, Sir.

1403
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:01,930
您做得比我还好  陛下
Almost did it better than myself, Sir.

1404
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:04,720
国王陛下  您让我难以言表
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.

1405
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:06,790
恭喜您  陛下
Congratulations, Sir.

1406
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:08,090
先生们
Gentlemen.

1407
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:10,560
恭喜您  国王陛下
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1408
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:12,380
你觉得爸爸怎么样  伊丽莎吧
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?

1409
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:18,090
开始有些吞吐  但已经很好了  爸爸
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.

1410
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:19,760
亲一个
Bless you.

1411
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:24,580
-你觉得呢  玛格丽特  -真是太精彩了  爸爸
- And how about you, Margaret? - You were just splendid, Papa.

1412
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:26,050
那当然了
Of course I was.

1413
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:29,600
都准备好了吗
We all ready?

1414
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:31,830
来吧姑娘们
Come on girls.

1415
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:38,200
1944年  乔治六世国王为莱昂纳尔・罗格授予了英国皇家维多利亚勋章

1416
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:45,930
这是为感谢为君主个人服务而特别设立的唯一勋章

1417
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:55,930
此后国王的每一次战争演讲都有莱昂纳尔陪同
通过广播  乔治六世国王成为国家抵抗的象征

1418
01:51:57,930 --> 01:52:02,730
莱昂纳尔和博迪在有生之年一直保持友谊
