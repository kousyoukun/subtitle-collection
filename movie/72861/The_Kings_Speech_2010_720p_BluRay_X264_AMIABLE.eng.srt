00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,630
(1925) King George V reigns over a quarter of the world¡¯s people.

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,470
He asks his second son, the Duke of York,

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,900
to give the closing speech at the Empire Exhibition in Wembley, London.

6
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,300
The King¡¯s Speech

7
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,230
You're live in two minutes. Your Royal Highness

8
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,150
Sir

9
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,270
Thank you

10
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,250
Let the microphone do the work, sir.

11
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,610
I am sure you will be splendid. Just take your time.

12
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,340
Time to go.

13
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,230
Good afternoon.

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,370
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services

15
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,680
taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.

16
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,540
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York

17
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,740
will read a message from the his father,

18
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,920
his Majesty, King George the fifth.

19
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,260
-58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part,

20
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,030
making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,090
Your Majesty, 3 flashes, and steady red means you¡¯re live.

22
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,340
Using the new invention of radio

23
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,470
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,940
addressed his subjects on the wireless.

25
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,890
At the close of the first Season

26
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,140
The air to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince Wales made his first broadcast

27
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,460
And today, his younger brother his Royal Highness, the Duke of York

28
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,210
will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.

29
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,430
I have received

30
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,630
from his Majesty

31
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,890
the¡­the¡­the

32
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,240
...the King

33
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,960
(145 Piccadilly, London 1934)

34
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,350
Inhale deep into your lungs, your Royal Highness.

35
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,770
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

36
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,970
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.

37
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,910
If Your Highness will be so kind as to open your hand...

38
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,410
Sterilized.

39
00:05:53,170 --> 00:06:04,090
-1,2,3,4,5,6,7

40
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,670
Now...if I may take the liberty?

41
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,990
...insert them into your mouth.

42
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?

43
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,160
It¡¯s the classic approach that cured Demosthenes.

44
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,550
That was in Ancient Greece. Has it worked since?

45
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,290
Now if you would be so kind as to read. A wealth of words.

46
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,400
Fight against those marbles Your Royal Highness.

47
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,410
Enunciate!

48
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,190
A little more concentration your Royal Highness.

49
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,040
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

50
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,040
Thank you so much, Doctor,

51
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,210
it¡¯s been most interesting.

52
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,940
Your Royal Highness

53
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,420
Insert marbles!

54
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,880
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!

55
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,270
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

56
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,320
You can¡¯t keep doing this, Bertie.

57
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,690
I know. Promise me

58
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,130
Promise me: no more.

Australia is calling;Sydney bridge celebrations mar 1932

62
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,450
Hello. Is anyone there?

63
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,040
I¡¯m just in the loo.

64
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
Hello Mrs Johnson, there you are.

65
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,860
Sorry I don't have receptionist.I like to keep things simple

66
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,640
¡°Poor and content is rich and rich enough¡±

67
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,590
For?

68
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,070
Shakespeare. How are you?

69
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,950
How do you do

70
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,390
Ahh, traveling alone

71
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,700
Now, this is slightly awkward

72
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,350
But I¡¯m afraid you¡¯re late.

73
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,530
Yes, I¡¯m afraid I am.

74
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,050
Where¡¯s Mr Johnson?

75
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,740
He doesn¡¯t know I¡¯m here.

76
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,420
That¡¯s not a very promising start.

77
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,930
No. My husband has seen everyone to no avail. He¡¯s given up hope.

78
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,420
He hasn¡¯t seen me.

79
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,150
You¡¯re awfully sure of yourself.

80
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,970
I¡¯m sure of anyone who wants to be cured.

81
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,280
Of course he wants to be cured.

82
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,910
My husband is required to speak publicly.

83
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,140
Perhaps he should change jobs.

84
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,800
He can¡¯t.

85
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,410
Indentured servitude?

86
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,510
Something of that nature.Yes

87
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,070
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...

88
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,660
Tuesday would be good...

89
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,320
He can give me his personal details and I¡¯ll make a frank appraisal.

90
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,940
And then we can take it from there

91
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,260
Doctor, forgive me.

92
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,770
I do not have a ¡°hubby¡±. We don¡¯t ¡®pop¡¯.

93
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,280
And nor do we never talk about our private lives.

94
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,720
You must come to us.

95
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,220
Sorry, Mrs J, my game, my turf, my rules.

96
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,140
You¡¯ll have to talk over with your husband

97
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,890
And then you can speak to me on the telephone

98
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,930
Thank you very much for dropping by.

99
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,790
Good afternoon

100
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,160
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?

101
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,650
The Duke of York?

102
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,370
Yes the Duke of York.

103
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,980
I thought the appointment was for ¡°Johnson¡±?

104
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,290
- Forgive me, your Royal...? - Highness.

105
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,680
Your Royal Highness.

106
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,500
Johnson was used during the Great War

107
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,420
when the Navy didn¡¯t want the enemy to know ¡®he¡¯ was aboard.

108
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,920
Am I considered the enemy?

109
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,700
You will be if you remain un-obliging.

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,030
You¡¯ll appreciate the need for absolutely discretion

111
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,170
Of course.

112
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,500
How did you find me? Your Royal Highness

113
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,860
The President of the Society for Speech Therapists

114
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,550
Eileen McCleod? She¡¯s a sport.

115
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,090
She warned me your antipodean methods were

116
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,550
¡°unorthodox and controversial¡±.

117
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,580
I warned her...they were not my favorite words.

118
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,670
I can cure your husband.

119
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,150
But for my method to work

120
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,910
I need trust and total equality here in the safety of my consultation room.

121
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,360
No exceptions.

122
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,560
Well then, in that case...

123
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,450
When can you start?

124
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,540
BOVRIL NOURISHES YOU TO RESIST 'FLU

125
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,650
Still sounds a bit rough.

126
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,460
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

127
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,750
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?

128
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,320
Yes, I¡¯ve hardly been out of the car all day.

129
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,250
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

130
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,800
May I be please leave the table?

131
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,070
How special is special?

132
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,740
You must stay, bored stupid,listening to your parents¡¯ inane conversation.

133
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,960
Thanks, dad!

134
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,160
- And mum. - And mum!

135
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,810
- Me too - You're meeting Jean?

136
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,470
No, someone else

137
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,340
Doctor? Doctor? Don't you help you brother with the washing up

138
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,680
I¡¯m fine

139
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,080
Who is it Lionel?

140
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,020
Why bring it up if you can¡¯t talk about it?

141
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,610
Myrtle, just a woman looking to help her husband.

142
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,570
And I had a ¡®call¡¯. For an audition

143
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,580
- One of my favourates.- Aren¡¯t they all.

144
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,780
- Could be a lot of fun ¨C I¡¯m sure you¡¯ll be splendid

145
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,350
In the amateur scene, they¡¯re a highly regarded group

146
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,340
From Putney.

147
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,840
That's all girls.Tomorrow, Chapter 4,The Flight

148
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,660
- I long to know they fly to  - I can¡¯t wait

149
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,810
Oh, to fly away!

150
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,770
Weren¡¯t they lucky!

151
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,420
Now Papa tell a story!

152
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,680
Could I be a penguin instead?

153
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,790
Now I want to a penguin story.

154
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,400
Very quickly

155
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,720
Once there were two princesses

156
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,080
Princesses Elisabeth, and Princesses Margret

157
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,760
Their papa was a penguin

158
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,340
This was because he been turned into by a wicked witch

159
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,480
This was inconvenient for him because he loved

160
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,440
to hold his princesses in his arms

161
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,610
and you can¡¯t do that if you¡¯re a penguin,

162
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,290
because you have wings like herrings.

163
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,360
Herrings don¡¯t have wings.

164
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,060
Penguins have wings which like the shape of herrings.

165
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,350
And what make matters worse she sent him to the South Pole

166
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,970
which is an awfully long walk back if you can¡¯t fly.

167
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,890
When he reached the water

168
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,850
He dived in, through the depth so fast

169
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,410
that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.

170
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,550
From there he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction

171
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,340
and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.

172
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,520
He swam up the Thames and out through the plughole,

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,200
giving the cook mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.

174
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,070
When the girls heard all the commotion

175
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,040
They run to the kitchen where they gave him

176
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,630
a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.

177
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,520
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?

178
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,680
A handsome prince!

179
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,480
A short-tailed Albatross.

180
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,990
With wings big enough that he could wrap them both around his two girls together

181
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,810
Now girls, time for bed. Come on

182
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,830
Take the horses to the stable

183
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,380
You have exactly a minute

184
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,570
Good night

185
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,260
feed them brush them and to bed.

186
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,140
Will Mrs Simpson be there?

187
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,080
My brother¡¯s insisting.

188
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,820
Is he serious?

189
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,180
About our coming to dinner?

190
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,480
No. About her!

191
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,800
A married woman? He can¡¯t be.

192
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,310
She can. By the way I think I found someone rather interesting.

193
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,670
On Harley Street. A doctor.

194
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,660
Out of the question. I¡¯m not having this conversation again.

195
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,870
The matter¡¯s settled.

196
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,240
His approach seems rather different....

197
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,670
Now?

198
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:28,900
Now!

199
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,850
¡°Now is the winter of our discontent

200
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,840
Made glorious summer by this sun of York.¡±

201
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,470
¡°And all the clouds that lour¡¯d upon our house

202
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

203
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,690
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;

204
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,410
Thank you.

205
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,160
Lovely diction, Mr...

206
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,950
Logue. Lionel Logue.

207
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,650
Well, Mr Logue,

208
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,130
I¡¯m not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.

209
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,420
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.

210
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,660
I do know all the lines.

211
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,190
I¡¯ve played the role before.

212
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,980
- Sydney? - Perth.

213
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,320
- Major theater town, is it? - Enthusiastic.

214
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,330
- Ah. - I was well reviewed.

215
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,650
Yes...well...Lionel,

216
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,500
I think our dramatic society is looking for

217
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,490
someone slightly younger

218
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,830
and a little more regal.

219
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,700
You have to shut that one first.

220
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,200
Close that one first, that

221
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,910
Where did you find this...physician?

222
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,270
Classifieds, next to ¡°French model, Shepherd¡¯s Market¡±.

223
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,500
He comes highly recommended.

224
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,210
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.

225
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,260
Oh dear, perhaps he¡¯s a Bolshevik?!

226
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,300
He has no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.

227
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,820
The Johnsons.

228
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,270
You can go in now, ¡°Mr. Johnson¡±.

229
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,590
Lionel says...wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.

230
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,490
Or, it being a p-pleasant day,

231
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,150
p-perhaps take a stroll.

232
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,520
Was that alright...Lionel?

233
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,380
Marvellous, Willy

234
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,670
You can stay here and wait for your mum.

235
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,980
Mrs Johnson. Mr.Johnson, do come in.

236
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,040
Would you like a sweetie

237
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
He¡¯s a good lad, Willy.

238
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,010
He could hardly make a sound, you know,

239
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,580
when he first came to me.

240
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,590
My boys made those. Good, aren¡¯t they.

241
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,480
Please, make yourself comfortable.

242
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,780
I was told not not to sit too close.

243
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,430
when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.

244
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,290
Waiting for me to¡­ commence a conversation

245
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,680
one can wait a rather long wait.

246
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,350
Do you know any jokes?

247
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,480
Timing isn¡¯t my strong suit.

248
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,430
Cuppa tea?

249
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,920
No thank you.

250
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,890
I think I¡¯ll have one.

251
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,580
Aren¡¯t you going to start treating me Dr Logue?

252
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,460
Only if you¡¯re interested in being treated.

253
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,210
Please, call me Lionel.

254
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,110
I¡­ I prefer Doctor.

255
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,110
I prefer Lionel. What¡¯ll I call you?

256
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,860
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.

257
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,790
A bit formal for here. I prefer names

258
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,980
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?

259
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,120
How about Bertie?

260
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,030
Only my family uses that.

261
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,180
Perfect. In here, it¡¯s better if we¡¯re equals.

262
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,400
If we were equal.. I wouldn¡¯t be here.

263
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:33,090
I'd be.. at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.

264
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,110
Please don¡¯t do that.

265
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,910
I¡¯m sorry?

266
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,060
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.

267
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,210
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.

268
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,730
They¡¯re idiots.

269
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,160
They¡¯ve all been knighted.

270
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,940
Makes it official then.

271
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,250
My ¡¯castle¡¯, my rules.

272
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,180
Thank you

273
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,610
What was your earliest memory?

274
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,680
What an earth do you mean?

275
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,230
Your first recollection.

276
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,900
I¡¯m not¡­

277
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,300
here to discuss personal matters.

278
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,920
Why¡¯re you here then?

279
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,670
Because I bloody well stammer!

280
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,620
You have a bit of a temper.

281
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,510
One of my many faults.

282
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,250
When did the defect start?

283
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,910
I¡¯ve always been this way!

284
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,080
I doubt that.

285
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,500
Don't.. tell me! It's my stammer!

286
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,130
It¡¯s my field. I assure you,

287
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,060
no infant starts to speak with a stammer.

288
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,530
When did it start?

289
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,540
Four or five.

290
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,990
That¡¯s typical.

291
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,510
So I¡¯ve been told.

292
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,710
I can¡¯t remember not doing it.

293
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,800
I can believe that. Do you hesitate when you think?

294
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,510
Don¡¯t be ridiculous.

295
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,510
How about when you talk to yourself?

296
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,350
Everyone natters occasionally, Bertie.

297
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,020
Stop calling me that!

298
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,660
I¡¯m not going to call you anything else.

299
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,130
Then we shan¡¯t speak!

300
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,020
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

301
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,960
A fortune.

302
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,980
I¡¯ll just save that brew

303
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,470
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?

304
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,320
Of course not!

305
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,950
That proves your impediment isn¡¯t a permanent part of you.

306
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,380
What do you think was the cause?

307
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,470
I don¡¯t know! I¡­ don¡¯t care!

308
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,930
I stammer. And no one can fix it.

309
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,990
I¡¯ll bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.

310
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,950
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.

311
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,250
And if I win?

312
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,960
You don¡¯t have to answer them.

313
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,520
One usually¡­ wagers money.

314
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,480
A bob each to keep it sweet? Let¡¯s see your shilling.

315
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,510
I don¡¯t¡­ carry money.

316
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,830
I had a funny feeling you mightn¡¯t.

317
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,000
I¡¯ll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.

318
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,980
If there is a next time.

319
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,270
I haven¡¯t agreed to take you on yet

320
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,810
So please stand, and take a look at that, from there

321
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,990
I can¡¯t read this.

322
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,100
Then you owe me a shilling for not trying.

323
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:13,660
¡°To.. to..be or not to be,

324
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,970
That¡­ is..¡±  damn

325
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960
I haven¡¯t finished yet.

326
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,480
I¡¯m going to record your voice

327
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,190
And then play it back to you on the same machine.

328
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,220
This is brilliant. It¡¯s the latest thing from America :a Silvertone.

329
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,750
Pop these on?

330
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,030
There¡¯s a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!

331
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,130
- You¡¯re playing music. - I know.

332
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,290
How can I hear what I¡¯m saying?!

333
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,610
Surely a Prince¡¯s brain knows what its mouth is doing?

334
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,950
You¡¯re not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

335
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,010
(to be or not to be.. that is the question)

336
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,950
Hopeless. Hopeless!

337
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,240
You were sublime.

338
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,250
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?

339
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,040
I¡¯ve no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.

340
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,700
- let me play it back to you - No.

341
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,920
Alright then, I¡¯ll get to ask you the questions.

342
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,710
Thank you Doctor, I don¡¯t¡­ feel this is for me.

343
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,350
Thank you for your time. Bye

344
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,730
Sir?

345
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,510
The recording is free.

346
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,480
Please keep it as a souvenir?

347
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,810
No

348
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,190
Ah well.

349
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,350
bugger

350
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,140
King George V.Christmas Broadcast 1934,

351
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,150
For the present(Sandringham House,Norfolk)

352
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,700
the work to which we are all equally bound,

353
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,400
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility...

354
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,230
...within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking

355
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:42,160
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.

356
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,310
To all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.

357
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,860
God bless you.

358
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,140
And off air

359
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,950
Easy when you know how.

360
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,710
Sir?

361
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,770
Have a go yourself.

362
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,250
Congratulations, Sir.

363
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow.

364
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,490
Chap taught me everything I know:

365
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,440
let the microphone do the work.

366
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,970
Sir.

367
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
Thank you.

368
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,260
Sit up, straight back,

369
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,080
face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare its quare in the eye,

370
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,820
as you would any decent Englishman.

371
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,540
Show who¡¯s in command.

372
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,620
Papa I don't¡­think I read this

373
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,900
This devilish device will change everything if you won¡¯t.

374
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,320
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.

375
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,460
Now we must invade people¡¯s homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.

376
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,300
This family has been reduced to those lowest

377
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,730
beast of all creatures...we¡¯ve become...actors!

378
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,140
we¡¯re not a family, we¡¯re a firm.

379
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,670
Yet any moment some of us may be out of work.

380
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,690
Your darling brother... and future king

381
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,030
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!

382
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,560
He¡¯s broken off with Lady Furness.

383
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,070
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!

384
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,990
I told him straight no divorced person can ever be received at court.

385
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,970
He said she made him sublimely happy.

386
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,400
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.

387
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,000
¡°I give you my word¡± this is what he said

388
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,480
¡°I give you my word, we¡¯ve never had immoral relations,¡±

389
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,670
Stared square into his father¡¯s eyes...

390
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,580
and lied.

391
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,850
When I¡¯m dead that boy will ruin himself, this family,

392
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,520
and this nation, within twelve months.

393
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,100
Who¡¯ll pick up the pieces?

394
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,410
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,

395
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,410
Marshall Stalin the other half?

396
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,430
Who¡¯ll stand between us, the jackboots,

397
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,240
and the proletarian abyss? You?

398
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,030
With your older brother shirking his duties,

399
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,410
you¡¯re going to have to do a lot more of this.

400
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,910
Have a go yourself.

401
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,220
Through..the¡­ one of the m-

402
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,700
Get it out boy!

403
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,010
...m-marvels of m-

404
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,060
Modern - just take your time

405
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,580
form your words carefully

406
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,550
Science, I am enabled, this C

407
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:43,030
Relax! Just try it!

408
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,080
...this Christmas Day, to speak to all my p-

409
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,670
Do it!

410
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,650
Lying bastard.

411
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,360
- You¡¯re playing music. - I know.

412
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,900
How can I hear what I¡¯m saying?!

413
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,240
Surely a Prince¡¯s brain knows what its mouth is doing?

414
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,520
You¡¯re not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

415
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,810
¡°To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -

416
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,010
¡°...whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

417
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,860
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

418
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,340
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

419
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,970
And by opposing end them..

420
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,840
To die, to sleep no more

421
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,700
And by a sleep to say we end

422
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,320
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks

423
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,190
That flesh is heir to? ¡®tis a consummation¡­¡±

424
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,480
Hopeless! Hopeless!

425
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,800
Strictly business. No.. personal nonsense.

426
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,620
I thought I¡¯d made that very clear in our interview.

427
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,430
Got the shilling you owe me?

428
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,210
No I haven¡¯t

429
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,650
Didn¡¯t think so.

430
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,720
Besides, you¡­tricked me!

431
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,360
Physical exercises and tricks are important

432
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,460
But what you¡¯re asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.

433
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,740
Is that that¡¯s sufficient? Ah, no.

434
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,750
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.

435
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,370
Maybe just deal with that.

436
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,300
I..I¡¯m willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...

437
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,680
Lionel.

438
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,740
Are you¡­ willing to do your part?

439
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,050
Alright. You want mechanics?

440
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,420
We need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue.

441
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,770
By repeating tongue twisters for example.

442
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,320
¡°I am a thistle-sifter.

443
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,810
I have a sieve of sifted thistles

444
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,170
And a sieve of unsifted thistles.

445
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,510
Because I am a thistle sifter.¡±

446
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,930
Fine.

447
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,050
You do have a flabby tummy,

448
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,450
We¡¯ll need to spend some time strength in your diaphragm.

449
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,850
Simple mechanics.

450
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,190
That is all we ask.

451
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,460
And that¡¯s about a shilling¡¯s worth.

452
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,790
Forget about the blessed shilling!

453
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,720
Perhaps, upon occasion,

454
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,820
You might be request to assistance¡­

455
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,040
in coping with¡­some minor event.

456
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,890
Will that be agreeable?

457
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,670
Of course.

458
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,350
That will be the full extent of your services.

459
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,290
Shall I see you next week?

460
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,300
I shall see you every day.

461
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,330
Feel the loosening of the jaw

462
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,110
Good. Little bounces,bounces

463
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,670
Shoulders. shoulders

464
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,550
Now loose

465
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,960
Take a nice deep breath, expand the chest

466
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,480
Put your hands on your ribs

467
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,030
Deeper, good

468
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,550
How do you feel?

469
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,150
Full of hot air.

470
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,870
Isn¡¯t that what public speaking is all about?

471
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,980
My wife and I are glad to visit this important¡­

472
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,860
Take a good deep breathe, and up come your Royal Highness

473
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,120
And slowly exhale and down come your Royal Highness

474
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,790
- are you alright, Bertie?  - yes

475
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,100
this is actually quite good fun.

476
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,240
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmother.

477
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,080
Short the humming each time

478
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,590
Manufacturing¡­the district¡­

479
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,750
- Another deep breath and ¡°jack and Jill¡± - ¡°Jack and Jill¡±

480
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,920
- Went up the hill - went up the hill

481
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,450
Just sway¡­ perfect

482
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,420
We are not permit to ask¡­to

483
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,790
Loosen the shoulder

484
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,810
Ding dong bell, Pussy¡¯s in the well

485
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,170
Who put her in? Little Johnny Green

486
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,920
Have a short memory Bertie? Come on

487
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,380
- cow - cow

488
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,760
- king - king

489
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,450
Anyone who can shout vowels in an open window can learn to deliver a speech.

490
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:09,100
- 14¡­15
- Deep breath. And it is..

491
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,450
- it is ... - let the words flow

492
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,110
mine doesn¡¯t bloody work

493
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,540
come on, one more time, Bertie

494
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,740
you can do it

495
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,650
a sieve of sifted thistles

496
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,590
- father - father

497
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,830
- Wait for ¡°aa¡± in patient - father

498
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,820
Sandringham Estate 1936

499
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,220
- Hello, Bertie. - Hello David

500
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,440
- I see you¡¯ve been coming out - Not at all

501
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,060
Been waiting long? For Christ, bloody freezing

502
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,160
Where¡¯ve you been?

503
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,830
Been busy.

504
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,120
So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.

505
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,800
I¡¯m sorry. She¡¯ll recover.

506
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,360
Father won¡¯t.

507
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,850
I¡¯ll drive.

508
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,830
Old bugger¡¯s doing this on purpose.

509
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,930
Dying?

510
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,790
Departing prematurely to complicate matters with Wallis.

511
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,140
Oh for heaven¡¯s sake, David.

512
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,250
You know how long he¡¯s been ill.

513
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,800
Wallis explained. She¡¯s terribly clever about these things.

514
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,000
... whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal,

515
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,820
bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912

516
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,500
his Majesty King George V did constitute,

517
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,490
order and declare that there should be a guardian,

518
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,380
- what¡¯s going on here? - Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State.

519
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,920
I cannot follow you. I¡¯m confused and I don¡¯t understand

520
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,620
- ¡­ what you¡¯re taking about  - It¡¯s the order of the Council for the State, Sir.

521
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,670
- would you do that? - So we may act on your behalf.

522
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:43,310
not clearly I¡¯m afraid...I¡¯m still confused...

523
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,490
But Approved. Thank you.

524
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,070
- Let me help you sir - alright

525
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,470
- thank you sir - thank you

526
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,730
Feeling a little better Sir?

527
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,780
No. I¡¯m not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.

528
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,270
Been ice-skating?

529
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,380
No, George.

530
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,850
Yes, he¡¯s alright. Of course.

531
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,450
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk,

532
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,960
is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.

533
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,190
Nor making our own drowsies either,

534
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,780
as we¡¯ve had to do far too often lately.

535
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,740
- David, the dinner - I¡¯m on with Wallis

536
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,870
It¡¯s Bertie.

537
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,870
No, it¡¯s not important. No. I don¡¯t want to

538
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,050
No, telephone me later? Right, bye

539
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,360
Wallis misses me terribly.

540
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,310
Mama says you¡¯re late for dinner.

541
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,580
She forgets Papa¡¯s bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!

542
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,220
How is the king? I hope he is not in pain.

543
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,960
No, no, His Majesty is quieter now.

544
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,740
Thank you

545
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,760
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.

546
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,360
None of this..unpleasantness would be tolerated

547
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,880
You know Sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father

548
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,950
Both in outlook and temperament.

549
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,740
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,

550
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,080
I tried in your interest to present it in a most favorable light.

551
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,020
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.

552
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,240
I¡¯m fear our vigil will not be of long duration.

553
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,580
Please continue, thank you

554
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,640
just commend our brother George to the mercy of God,

555
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,810
our Maker and Redeemer.

556
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,230
Long live the King.

557
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,230
I hope I will make good as he has made good.

558
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,750
What on earth was that?

559
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,840
Poor Wallis. Now I¡¯m trapped!

560
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,320
And in these last 25 crowded troubled glorious years

561
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,430
If there¡¯s one thing that King George has taught

562
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,400
It is the art of the leader with also a brother to his followers

563
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,550
As long as he lives he was the guiding star of a great nation

564
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,970
Dad? (When he died, the little children cried in the street)

565
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,760
Time for a Shake, dad?

566
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,900
- You sure? - Go on

567
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,640
Put your thinking caps on.

568
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,510
Bet its the Scottish Play.

569
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,520
No, I bet it¡¯s Othello. It¡¯s always Othello.

570
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,410
¡°Art thou afeard? Be not afeard¡±

571
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,040
- Caliban! - Oh! For heaven¡¯s sake.. that was a lucky guess!

572
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,670
Don¡¯t listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

573
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,680
¡°the isle is full of noises,

574
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,820
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.

575
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,160
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments

576
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,670
Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,

577
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,470
That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:¡±

578
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,470
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?

579
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,310
- ¡°..and then, in dreaming, Me thought the clouds¡± - the clouds me thought

580
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,990
¡°The clouds me thought would open,

581
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,630
And show riches Ready to drop upon me; that...¡±

582
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,830
...when I waked, I cried to dream again.¡±

583
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,310
It¡¯s such a sad thought.

584
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,230
My next patient must be a bit early. You better go lads, I¡¯m sorry.

585
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,150
Won¡¯t be a moment, Clifford.

586
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,930
Bertie, they told me not to expect you.

587
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,310
Sorry about your father.

588
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,660
I don¡¯t wish to intrude..

589
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,710
No..Not at all, please come in

590
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,440
I¡¯ve been practising. One hour a day.

591
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,450
In spite of everything.

592
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,190
What¡¯s going on there?

593
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,670
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.

594
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,250
Do you feel like working today?

595
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,490
A Curtis bi-plane.

596
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,670
I¡¯ll put on some hot milk.

597
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,420
Logue, I¡¯d kill for something stronger.

598
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,340
I wasn¡¯t there for my father¡¯s death.

599
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,370
Still makes me sad.

600
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,520
I can imagine so.

601
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,150
- What did you father do?  - He was brewer.

602
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,440
- Oh. - At least there was free beer.

603
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,950
Here¡¯s to the memory of your father.

604
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,300
I was informed, after the fact,

605
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,570
my father¡¯s ¡­last words were:

606
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,260
¡°Bertie has more.. guts than the rest of his brothers.. put together.¡±

607
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,320
He couldn¡¯t say that to my face.

608
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,220
My brother.

609
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,670
What about him?

610
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,700
- Try singing it. - I¡¯m sorry?

611
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,770
What songs do you know?

612
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,590
- Songs? - ¡°Swanee River¡±

613
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,060
- I love that song. - Happens to be my favorite.

614
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,680
- Sing me the chorus. - No. Certainly not.

615
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,270
I always.. wanted to build models.

616
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:55,380
Father¡­ wouldn¡¯t allow it. He.. collected stamps.

617
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,060
We had to collect stamps.

618
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,410
You can finish that off. If you sing.

619
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:08,950
- ¡°My brother David, doo-dah¡± - I¡¯m not going to sit here wobbling

620
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,170
You can with me.

621
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,430
Because¡­ you¡¯re peculiar.

622
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,290
I take that as a compliment.

623
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,190
Rules are rules

624
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,060
I¡¯m not¡­crooning ¡°Swanee River!¡±

625
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,590
Try ¡°Camptown Races¡± then.

626
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,060
¡°My brother D, he said to me, doodah doo-dah...¡±

627
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,840
- Continuous sound will give you flow. - No

628
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,110
Does it feel strange, now that David¡¯s on the throne?

629
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,810
Tell you the truth, It was a relief...

630
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:00,070
Knowing.. I wouldn't be ..King.

631
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,260
But unless he produces an heir, you¡¯re next in line.

632
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,610
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.

633
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,470
¡°You¡¯re barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.¡±

634
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,040
¡°Lionel,¡± You didn¡¯t stammer.

635
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,180
Of course I didn¡¯t stammer, I was singing!

636
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,290
Well, as a little reward,

637
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,130
you get to put some glue on these struts.

638
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,080
- your boy wouldn¡¯t mind? - No, not at all

639
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,340
David and I were very close.

640
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,300
Young bucks... You know.

641
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,720
Did you chase the same girls?

642
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:01,100
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.

643
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:10,550
We shared¡­ the expert ministrations of ¡°Paulette¡± in Paris.

644
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,810
Not at the same time of course.

645
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,720
Did David ever tease you?

646
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,520
Oh yes they all did.

647
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,330
¡°Buh-buh-buh-Bertie¡±.

648
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,260
Father encouraged it.

649
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,050
¡°Get it out, boy!¡±

650
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,850
Said it would make me stop.

651
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,160
Said...¡±I was afraid of my father,

652
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,810
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me¡±.

653
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,480
Are you naturally right handed?

654
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:57,080
Left. I was¡­ punished. Now I use the right.

655
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,320
Yes, that¡¯s very common with stammerers.

656
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,890
Anything other corrections?

657
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,030
Knock knees.

658
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:15,400
Metal¡­ splints were made...worn¡­day and night

659
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,750
That must have been painful.

660
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,170
Bloody agony. Straight legs now.

661
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,000
Who were you closest to in your family?

662
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,310
Nannies. Not my first nanny..

663
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,810
she loved David...hated me.

664
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:41,070
When I.. was presented to my parents for the daily viewing,

665
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,150
she¡¯d...She pinch me so I¡¯d cry,

666
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,040
and be¡­handed back to her immediately,

667
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,390
then she wouldn¡¯t¡­

668
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:08,850
- sing it - then she wouldn¡¯t feed me, far far away.¡±

669
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,180
Took my parents three years to notice.

670
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,550
As you can imagine,

671
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,620
it caused some stomach problems. Still.

672
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,440
What about your brother Johnnie?

673
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,080
Were you close to him?

674
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,330
Johnnie, Sweet boy.

675
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:55,570
Epilepsy...and...he was 'different'.

676
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:04,140
He died at 13, hidden from view.

677
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,910
I¡¯ve been told it¡¯s not catching.

678
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,250
- Do you want a top-up? - Please.

679
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,560
You know, Lionel,

680
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,460
- you¡¯re the first ordinary Englishman... - Australian.

681
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,820
...I¡¯ve ever really spoken to.

682
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,870
when I¡¯m driven through the streets and see,

683
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,840
you know, the Common Man staring at me,

684
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,940
I¡¯m struck by how little I know of his life,

685
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,380
and how little he knows of mine.

686
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,900
- Thank you - What¡¯re friends for.

687
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,280
I wouldn¡¯t know.

688
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,080
Balmoral Castle, Scotland

689
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,030
¡°I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles

690
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,230
through strong thick sieves.

691
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,020
I sifted seven...¡±

692
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,900
- isn¡¯t that enough darling? No? - I have to keep doing this

693
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,130
This is your fault.

694
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,240
- I sifted seven - Oh no

695
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,600
One hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!

696
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,490
Who do you think she is?

697
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,830
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.

698
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,140
You know she calls me ¡°The Fat Scottish Cook¡±?

699
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,930
You¡¯re not fat.

700
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,120
I¡¯m getting plump.

701
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,880
You seldom cook.

702
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,850
- I sifted seven. - Shut up!!

703
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,650
I sifted¡­

704
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,850
- 3,2,1 and booze - Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.

705
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,470
How lovely to see you both.

706
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,890
Welcome to our little country shack.

707
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,800
I came at the invitation of the King.

708
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,440
Your Majesty

709
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,650
- All right - Sorry we¡¯re late

710
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,980
Very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson

711
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,990
Very nice

712
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,810
Hello David.

713
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,860
Making¡­ some changes to the garden I see.

714
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,780
I am. I am not quite finished yet.

715
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,740
Don¡¯t tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.

716
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,510
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.

717
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,510
Etiquette decrees royalty should be greeted by the official host:

718
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,970
in this case: the King. Not a commoner.

719
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:09,090
- Thank you. - what is her hold on him?

720
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,320
I¡¯ve no idea.

721
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,660
Apparently she has certain...skills,

722
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,670
which she learnt in an establishment in Shanghai.

723
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,090
- David - just be a sec, darling

724
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,720
Excuse me.

725
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,340
David, I¡¯ve been trying to see you...

726
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,520
I¡¯ve been terribly busy.

727
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,170
- Doing what? - Kinging.

728
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,140
Really?

729
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:54,170
Kinging.. is a precarious business these days!

730
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,670
Where is the Tsar of Russia?

731
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,320
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?

732
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,640
You¡¯re being dreary.

733
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,080
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis

734
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,370
while there are people marching across Europe singing ¡°The Red Flag¡±?

735
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,380
Stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.

736
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,800
Who¡¯ll sort out Herr Hitler?

737
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,450
Where¡¯s the bloody 23¡¯?

738
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,690
And you¡¯ve put that woman into our mother¡¯s suite?

739
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,730
Mother¡¯s not still in the bed, is she?

740
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,900
That¡¯s not funny.

741
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,140
Here it is, Wally likes the very best.

742
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,700
I don¡¯t care what woman you carry on with at night,

743
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,270
as long as you show up for duty in the morning!

744
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,360
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.

745
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,170
We intend to marry

746
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,220
Excuse me?

747
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,680
She¡¯s filing a petition for divorce.

748
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,810
Good God.

749
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,780
Can¡¯t you just give her a nice house and a title?

750
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,390
I¡¯m not having her as my mistress.

751
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,740
The Church does not recognise divorce

752
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,100
and you are the¡­ head of the Church.

753
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,450
- Haven¡¯t I any rights? - Many privileges...

754
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,940
Not the same thing. Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,

755
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,990
Why not me?

756
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,470
If you were the Common Man,

757
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,450
on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!

758
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,600
Sounds like you¡¯ve studied our wretched constitution.

759
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,000
Sounds like you haven¡¯t.

760
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,200
Is that what this is all about? Bashing up?

761
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,960
Hence the elocution lessons?

762
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,480
That¡¯s the scoop around town.

763
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,430
I¡¯m trying to¡­to...

764
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,320
Yearning for a larger audience are we,

765
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,770
B-b-b-bertie?

766
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,160
D-don¡¯t¡­

767
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,290
What¡¯s that? I¡¯m sorry.

768
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,310
Young brother trying to push older brother off throne...

769
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,380
Po..Po..sitively medieval.

770
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,700
- Wallis - where have you been all this time?

771
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,060
I¡¯ve been talking to.

772
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,430
Never mind.

773
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,780
- It¡¯s very complicated little king you¡¯re  - I tried to be

774
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,700
All that work, down the drain.

775
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:05,670
My own ..brother... I couldn¡¯t say.. a single word to him in reply!

776
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,190
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?

777
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,950
Because you¡¯re bloody well paid to listen!

778
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,060
Bertie I¡¯m not a geisha girl.

779
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,200
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!

780
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,770
What is it about David that stops you speaking?

781
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:23,180
What is it about you that bloody well make you want to go on about it the whole bloody time?

782
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,930
Vulgar but fluent. You don¡¯t stammer when you swear.

783
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,200
Bugger off!

784
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,580
Is that the best you can do?

785
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:35,190
Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

786
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,070
A public school prig can do better than that.

787
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:46,100
Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

788
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,020
Defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?

789
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,280
Because I¡¯m angry!

790
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,770
Ah. Know the f-word?

791
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,110
Fornication?

792
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,580
Oh Bertie.

793
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,120
Fuck. Fuck, fucking, fuck!

794
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,380
Bugger, bugger, bugger!

795
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,130
Fuck Fuck ass

796
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,780
- Balls Balls Fuckity - Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!

797
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,390
Willy, Shit and Fuck, and tits

798
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,430
Dad? What¡¯s going on?

799
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,130
Sorry. Just finish your homework.

800
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,970
Well that¡¯s a side of you we don¡¯t get to see all that often.

801
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,720
No. No we¡¯re not supposed to really, not publicly.

802
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,610
Let¡¯s get some air.

803
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,380
No Logue, I don¡¯t think that¡¯s a good idea.

804
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,750
What¡¯s the matter? Why are you so upset?

805
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,690
Logue, you have no idea.

806
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:49,720
My brother.. is infatuated with a woman who¡¯s been married twice

807
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,450
She¡¯s asking for a divorce

808
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,990
And he is determined to marry her.

809
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,940
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.

810
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,620
That¡¯s not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?

811
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,700
Unthinkable.

812
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,020
- Can he do it? - Absolutely not.

813
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,060
But he¡¯s going to anyway. All hell¡¯s broken loose.

814
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,530
Can¡¯t they carry on privately?

815
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:16,880
If only they would.

816
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,410
Where does that leave you?

817
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,320
I know my place!

818
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:31,700
I¡¯ll¡­ do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.

819
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,060
Is it that serious? Your place may be on the throne.

820
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,710
I am not an alternative to my brother.

821
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,680
- You can outshine David... - Don¡¯t take liberties!

822
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,850
That¡¯s bordering on treason.

823
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,070
I¡¯m just saying you could be King. You could do it!

824
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,450
That is treason!

825
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,170
I¡¯m trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear.

826
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,710
I¡¯ve had enough of this!

827
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,160
What¡¯re you afraid of?

828
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:56,570
Your poisonous words!

829
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,920
Why¡¯d you come to me?

830
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,070
You¡¯re not middle-class banker who want elocution lessons¡­

831
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,660
- so you can chit-chat at posh tea parties? - Don¡¯t attempt to instruct me on my duties!

832
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:08,020
I¡¯m the son of a¡­ King...

833
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,370
the brother of a King...

834
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,820
You¡¯re the disappointing son of a brewer!

835
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,610
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!

836
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,820
You¡¯re nobody. These sessions are over!

837
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:01,600
Through here sir.

838
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,000
Garden Entrance.Prime Minister's Office.10 Dawning Street

839
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:07,990
It¡¯s not just because she¡¯s an American.

840
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:14,190
That the least of it, it¡¯s because she is soon to be a twice divorced American,

841
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,460
and the King, as the head of Church of England¡­

842
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:21,410
can not marry a divorced woman.

843
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:28,600
And sir, I apologize for the nature of this, but...

844
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,700
according to Scotland Yard,

845
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:40,670
the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs.Simpson¡¯s favours and affections,

846
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,620
sharing them with a married used car salesman,

847
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,750
a certain Mr Guy Trundle.

848
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:54,680
In addition, it is also rumored that Hitler¡¯s ambassador,

849
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,950
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day......

850
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:04,270
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government,

851
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,920
He must abdicate. Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.

852
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:15,910
Prime Minister, you¡¯d leave the country without a¡­ government?

853
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:20,190
Does the King do what he wants,

854
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,450
or does he do what his people expect him to do?

855
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,480
As crowds on Donning Street watch Ministers come and go

856
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,240
There raised an age-old problem.

857
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,940
Can the King separate his personal life from his public duty?

858
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,630
- What¡¯s the matter, love? - I¡¯m just having trouble with a patient

859
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,950
- it isn¡¯t like you. Why - He¡¯s scared.

860
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,010
Frightened of his own shadow.

861
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,720
Isn¡¯t that why they come to you?

862
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:58,660
This fellow could really be somebody great. He¡¯s fighting me.

863
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,940
Perhaps he doesn¡¯t want to be great.

864
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,000
Perhaps that¡¯s what you want.

865
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,500
I might have overstepped the mark.

866
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,470
Apologize. Deep of good.

867
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,770
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue,the Duke is busy

868
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,200
I¡¯m happy to wait. Or I could come back later.

869
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,820
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

870
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,520
Thank you

871
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,620
Thank you

872
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:06,220
Parliament will not support the marriage.

873
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,210
But there were other reasons for concern.

874
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,920
He was careless with state papers.

875
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:15,620
He lacked commitment and resolve.

876
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:20,450
There were those that worried where he would stand when war with Germany.

877
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,440
We¡¯re not coming to that?

878
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,030
Indeed we are, Sir. Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,

879
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,630
but Hitler¡¯s intent is crystal clear.

880
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,370
War with Germany will come,

881
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,930
and we will need a King we can all stand behind united.

882
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:47,500
I fear..my brother is of sound mind at this time

883
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,230
Have you thought what you will call yourself?

884
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,610
I¡­I¡­

885
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:02,290
Certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.

886
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:13,210
What about George? After your father?

887
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,500
George the sixth.

888
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,910
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don¡¯t you think.

889
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,390
David! Thank God. You look exhausted!

890
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,370
How are you bearing up?

891
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:39,010
Bertie. The decision¡¯s been made. I¡¯m¡­ I¡¯m going

892
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:43,660
I cannot accept that. You are in no condition to make that decision.

893
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,630
I¡¯m afraid there¡¯s no other way.

894
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,450
I must marry her.

895
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,570
My mind¡¯s made up. I¡¯m... sorry.

896
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:58,960
That¡¯s a terrible thing to hear.

897
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,360
nobody wants that. I least of all.

898
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:19,240
At long last I am able to say a few words of my own.

899
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,090
I have never wanted to withhold anything

900
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:27,980
But until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.

901
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:35,860
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.

902
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:43,180
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York

903
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,790
my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.

904
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,510
This I do with all my heart.

905
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:58,380
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.

906
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:02,680
But you must believe me when I tell you

907
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,790
That I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility

908
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,520
and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do

909
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,840
without the help and support of the woman I love...

910
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:25,520
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me

911
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:28,430
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

912
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,300
with his long training in the public affairs of this country...

913
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,760
...and with his fine qualities...

914
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,310
...will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption

915
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:47,650
or injury to the life and progress of the empire.

916
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:53,010
Accession Council.St James's Palace.12th Dec,1936

917
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:09,660
I meet you today.. in..

918
01:13:13,031 --> 01:13:17,291
in circumstances which are ..

919
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:34,700
I¡¯m sure you¡¯ll love it.

920
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:37,150
Thank you darling, saddles, Margret

921
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,780
Yes mom.

922
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,800
Good boy.

923
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,170
- Mama, here¡¯s the Wilson saddle - thank you

924
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,430
Don¡¯t worry, we¡¯ll get you food in a minute

925
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:50,250
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?

926
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,340
Of course we will, darling, we¡¯ll have a palace of rooms.

927
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,400
Curtsey.

928
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,710
Your Majesty.

929
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,240
How was it?

930
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:45,900
I¡¯m trying to¡­ familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.

931
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:55,000
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don¡¯t understand a word of.

932
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,730
David¡¯s finances.

933
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,810
The Christmas broadcast ¨C

934
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:11,950
I think that might be a mistake.

935
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,420
Don¡¯t worry about that

936
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,620
Plans for the Coronation. I think that¡¯s an even bigger mistake.

937
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,750
I¡¯m not a King.

938
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,970
I¡¯m a naval officer. That¡¯s all I know

939
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:47,280
I¡¯m not a King, not a king.

940
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,870
- I¡¯m sorry. I¡¯m sorry. - No. Dear.

941
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:01,170
Dear, dear man...

942
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,790
I¡¯m sorry.

943
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:10,060
You know, I refused your first two marriage proposals,

944
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,120
Not because I didn¡¯t love you,

945
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,290
but because I couldn¡¯t bear the idea of a royal life

946
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,330
Could bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties,

947
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:24,420
a life that no longer was really to be my own.

948
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:29,400
Then I thought...he stammers so beautifully...

949
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,710
they¡¯ll leave us alone.

950
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:40,120
STAND BY THE KING.GOD SAVE THE KING

951
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,740
Waiting for a king to apologize,

952
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,980
one can wait rather a long wait.

953
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,010
I¡¯m afraid we¡¯re slightly late.

954
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:15,370
- This is home. Myrtle¡¯s at bridge.

955
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,080
I¡¯ve made sure the boys are out.

956
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,310
It¡¯s lovely. Absolutely lovely.

957
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,860
- May I sit down? - Yes, of course

958
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,140
Would you like some tea, Ma¡¯am?

959
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,820
Yes. I¡¯ll help myself.

960
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,060
Off you go now. Or must I knock your heads together?

961
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,230
Here¡¯s your shilling

962
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:57,130
I.. understand what you were trying to say, Logue.

963
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:02,630
I went about it the wrong way. I¡¯m sorry.

964
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,550
So here I am.

965
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:11,840
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?

966
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:15,350
Every stammer always fears they will fall back to square one.

967
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,030
I don¡¯t let that happen.

968
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:22,620
If I fail in my duty... David could come back.

969
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,360
I¡¯ve seen the placards

970
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:29,370
¡°God Save Our¡­ King!¡±

971
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,680
They don¡¯t mean me.

972
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:40,090
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead,

973
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,040
Or about to be.

974
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,860
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.

975
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:00,010
Bloody mess! I can¡¯t even give them a Christmas Speech.

976
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,100
- Like your Dad used to do? - Precisely.

977
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,680
He¡¯s not here anymore.

978
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,350
Yes he is. He¡¯s on that shilling I gave you.

979
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,290
Easy enough to give away.

980
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,960
You don¡¯t have to carry him around in your pocket.

981
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:20,250
Or your brother.

982
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,270
You don¡¯t need to be afraid of things you were afraid of when you were five.

983
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,580
You¡¯re very much your own man, Bertie.

984
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,970
Right

985
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,150
Your face is next, mate.

986
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,030
Lionel? Dear?

987
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,410
Myrtle!

988
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,980
- Is this your wife? - Yes.

989
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,930
Bertie, come here

990
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:56,740
- Are you alright, Logue? - Yes.

991
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:01,250
Shall we go through?

992
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,960
Trust me it¡¯s important.

993
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,890
What is it?

994
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,860
Your... your...

995
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,910
It¡¯s ¡°Your Majesty¡±, the first time.

996
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,410
After that, ¡°Ma¡¯am¡±, as in ham, not Ma¡¯lm as in palm.

997
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,230
I haven¡¯t told her about us. Sit down, relax.

998
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,070
I¡¯m told your husband calls my husband Bertie

999
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,020
and my husband calls your husband Lionel.

1000
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,550
I trust you won¡¯t call me Liz.

1001
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,350
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma¡¯am.

1002
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:35,460
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue

1003
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,250
- Logue, we can¡¯t stay here all day. - Yes we can.

1004
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:42,650
- Logue.. - Look, I need to wait for the opportune moment.

1005
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,860
- You¡¯re being a coward! - You¡¯re damn right.

1006
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:48,320
Get out there, man!

1007
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:54,530
Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! You¡¯re early.

1008
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,890
I believe you two have met!

1009
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:01,760
I don¡¯t believe you know....King George VI?

1010
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,000
It¡¯s very nice to meet you.

1011
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,400
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?

1012
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,490
We would love to, such a treat, but alas...

1013
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,580
a previous engagement. What a pity.

1014
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,590
Archbishop.

1015
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,380
Welcome your Majesty.

1016
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,120
What a glorious transformation, Sir.

1017
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,530
I hope you¡¯ll forgive us if we continue our preparations.

1018
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:51,990
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.

1019
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:00,880
We begin, of course at the West Door, then into the nave.

1020
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,880
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1021
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:11,870
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora¡¯s Box.

1022
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,020
I¡¯m afraid I¡¯ve also had to permit the newsreel cameras.

1023
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:19,900
The product of which I shall personally edit.

1024
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,170
Without momentary hesitation.

1025
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,270
This is Dr. Logue from Harley Street.

1026
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:29,620
He¡¯s¡­ my speech therapist.

1027
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,440
Your Grace

1028
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:34,840
Had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance

1029
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,050
I would¡¯ve made my own recommendation.

1030
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:42,450
Dr. Logue will be attending the Coronation.

1031
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,530
Well of course I shall speak to the Dean,

1032
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,830
but it will be extremely difficult.

1033
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:55,510
I should like¡­ the Doctor to be seated in the¡­ King¡¯s Box.

1034
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:59,680
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.

1035
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,560
That why it¡¯s suitable.

1036
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,340
And now, if you don¡¯t mind, your grace we need the premises.

1037
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,450
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!

1038
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,740
The Church must prepare his Majesty.

1039
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,250
My preparations are equally important.

1040
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,520
With complete privacy. If you don¡¯t mind.

1041
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,500
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1042
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,320
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty¡¯s disposal...this evening.

1043
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,460
Your Majesty.

1044
01:23:55,561 --> 01:23:58,461
Look, he again. Come on.

1045
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,740
I can¡¯t believe I¡¯m walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1046
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,530
Everything alright? Let¡¯s get cracking.

1047
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,230
I'm not here to rehearse, "Doctor" Logue.

1048
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:23,640
Call me Lionel

1049
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,440
True, you never¡­

1050
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:36,050
called yourself 'Doctor'.I did that for you.

1051
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:48,290
no training, no diploma, no.. qualifications.

1052
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,730
Just a great deal of nerve.

1053
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:56,180
the star chamber inquisition, is it?

1054
01:24:56,750 --> 01:25:01,860
You asked for trust and.. total equality.

1055
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,490
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley,

1056
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,940
I was there.

1057
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,170
My son Laurie said ¡°Do you think you could help that poor man?¡±

1058
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,980
What, as a failed actor!?

1059
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:18,140
It¡¯s true, I¡¯m not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,

1060
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,310
I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.

1061
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:27,990
When the Great War came, our soldiers were pouring back from the front,

1062
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,630
shell-shocked and unable to speak

1063
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:34,090
and somebody said,"Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.

1064
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,990
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers¡±.

1065
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:41,050
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation,

1066
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,700
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1067
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,100
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear,

1068
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,700
and no-one was listening to them.

1069
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,250
My job was to give them faith in their voice

1070
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:57,180
and let them know that a friend was listening.

1071
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:02,030
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.

1072
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,770
You give a very noble account of yourself.

1073
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,150
Make inquiries. It¡¯s all true.

1074
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:12,910
Inquiries have been made!

1075
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,290
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.

1076
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:24,080
I vouched for you and you have no¡­credentials.

1077
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,440
But lots of success! I can¡¯t show you a certificate

1078
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:29,280
there was no training then.

1079
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,080
All I know I know by experience,

1080
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,300
and that war was some experience.

1081
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,820
May plaque says, ¡®L.Logue, Speech Defects¡¯.

1082
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:41,690
No Dr., no letters after my name.

1083
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,860
Lock me in the Tower.

1084
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,220
I would if I could!

1085
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,480
On what charge?

1086
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,650
Fraud! With war looming,

1087
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:56,510
you¡¯ve saddle this nation with a voiceless King.

1088
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,790
You destroyed the happiness of my family...

1089
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,950
all for the sake of ensnaring a star patient

1090
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,080
you couldn't possibly hope to assist!

1091
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,080
It¡¯ll be like mad ¡­King George the Third,

1092
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:21,870
there¡¯ll be¡­Mad King George the Stammerer,

1093
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,270
who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!

1094
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:31,220
What¡¯re you doing? Get up! You can¡¯t sit there! Get up

1095
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:32,750
Why not? It¡¯s a chair.

1096
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:38,200
No, it¡¯s not, that is¡­ Saint Edward¡¯s Chair-

1097
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,910
People have carved their name into it!

1098
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,770
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen

1099
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,560
It¡¯s held in place by a large rock!

1100
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,080
That is the Stone of Scone,

1101
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,310
- you are trivialising everything - I don¡¯t care.

1102
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,520
I don¡¯t care how many Royal arses have sat in this chair-

1103
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,310
Listen to me... ! Listen to me... ! Listen to me... !

1104
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,730
- Listen to you?! By what right?

1105
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:55,520
My divine right, if you must! I¡¯m your King!!!

1106
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,320
Noooo you¡¯re not! Told me so yourself.

1107
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,170
Said you didn¡¯t want it. Why should I waste my time listening to you?

1108
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:01,550
Because I have a right to be heard!

1109
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,380
I HAVE A VOICE!!!

1110
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,820
Yes you do.

1111
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:21,440
You have such perseverance, Bertie,

1112
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,870
you¡¯re the bravest man I know.

1113
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,310
you¡¯ll make a bloody good king.

1114
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,530
What on earth¡¯s going on, Sir?

1115
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,220
It¡¯s quite all right, Archbishop.

1116
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:41,640
Mr Logue, you should know that I have found a replacement English specialist

1117
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:46,310
with impeccable credentials. Hence, your services will no longer be required.

1118
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,620
I¡¯m sorry?

1119
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:50,480
Your Majesty¡¯s function is to consult and be advised.

1120
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,820
You didn¡¯t consult, but you¡¯ve just been advised.

1121
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:02,790
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.

1122
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,390
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.

1123
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,070
I appreciate that Archbishop

1124
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,420
but it¡¯s my head!

1125
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,560
Your humble servant.

1126
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:25,680
Thank you Bertie.

1127
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,940
Shall we rehearse?

1128
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:31,520
Come on, up on your perch

1129
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,480
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through West door,

1130
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,950
you¡¯ll be greeted with the hymn ¡°I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me.¡±

1131
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,110
You won¡¯t actually be that glad,

1132
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,790
because they sing it for a great long time.

1133
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,110
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs towards you

1134
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:01,790
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"

1135
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,210
¡°I am willing¡±.

1136
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:07,970
Course you are! I¡¯ll see what it sounds like from the cheap seats

1137
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,710
so even your old nanny can hear.

1138
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:14,560
¡°Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland,

1139
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:20,780
Canada, Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?¡±

1140
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,910
"I solemnly promise so do so."

1141
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:26,030
LOUDER! I can¡¯t hear you up the back.

1142
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,170
¡°I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!¡±

1143
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:33,240
Very good! "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice,

1144
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:36,260
in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?"

1145
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,210
"I will." ¡°I WILL!¡±

1146
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,840
Then a long bit about upholding the faith goes on, rubbish, rubbish

1147
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,650
To which you finally say...

1148
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:49,910
¡°These things which I have here before promised,

1149
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:54,790
I will perform and keep. So help me God.¡±

1150
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,600
That¡¯s all you have to say. Four short responses,

1151
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,090
kiss the book and sign the oath.

1152
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,710
There you are: you¡¯re King.

1153
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:03,850
Easy.

1154
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,530
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!

1155
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:25,050
Someone had removed the thread marking the front of the Crown, Sir.

1156
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,650
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.

1157
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,120
Archbishop, your missing Papa.

1158
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,960
Very good, very good. Archbishop.

1159
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,510
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.

1160
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:46,710
You can switch that machine off now.

1161
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,440
No, wait, keeping going.

1162
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,220
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

1163
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:00,790
(Hitler)

1164
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,760
Papa, what¡¯s he saying?

1165
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:17,840
I don¡¯t know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.

1166
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:46,330
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.

1167
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:51,050
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.

1168
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:54,690
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.

1169
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,660
It¡¯s a matter of principal. I was mistaken.

1170
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:03,320
I have found it impossible to believe that

1171
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:11,380
there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1172
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:19,840
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.

1173
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:26,900
Churchill was right all along. This was always Hitler¡¯s intention.

1174
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:32,820
I am only sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.

1175
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:38,010
I am very much afraid Sir,

1176
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:41,780
That your greatest test is yet to come.

1177
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:53,040
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street.(3rd,Sep,1939)

1178
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:01,040
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government

1179
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:08,520
a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o¡¯clock

1180
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:13,540
that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1181
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,320
a state of war would exist between us.

1182
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:24,330
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received,

1183
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,730
and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.

1184
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:41,370
At last. Sir, here¡¯s your speech. You are on air at six.

1185
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:46,620
I¡¯ve timed it to just under nine minutes.

1186
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:48,960
The wording is fully approved.

1187
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:51,970
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast

1188
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,140
which will go out live across to the Nation,

1189
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,350
the Empire and to our Armed Forces.

1190
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:58,070
Get Logue here immediately.

1191
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:14,920
there are the barrage balloons.

1192
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:18,800
Yes, they got them up there quickly.

1193
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:34,360
Should we pull over and find shelter?

1194
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:36,660
No, go straight there. We'll be alright.

1195
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,000
- Yes sir? - Lionel Logue, Major Harding is expecting me

1196
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,490
This is my son Laurie

1197
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,300
- Thank you Laurie  -Good luck dad

1198
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,370
- The King¡¯s speech, we have about 40 minutes to the broadcast - Thank you

1199
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:17,190
Thank you very much. Thank you

1200
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:23,340
"There may be dark days ahead,and..."

1201
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,160
Try again.

1202
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:33,930
¡°There may be dark days ahead, andw-... ¡±

1203
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:37,080
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself,

1204
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,550
¡°God save the King¡±.

1205
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:41,740
I say that continually, but apparently no one¡¯s listening.

1206
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:45,220
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.

1207
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:48,330
Then I¡¯m the solemnest king who ever lived.

1208
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:52,620
If I am a..King...where is my power?

1209
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:54,900
Can I form a Government,

1210
01:36:55,310 --> 01:37:00,560
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?

1211
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,030
No! Yet I am the seat of all authority.

1212
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:08,010
Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak,

1213
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:10,190
I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!

1214
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:15,130
Let's take it all again from the top. "In this grave hour..."

1215
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:31,440
¡°In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck

1216
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,670
perhaps the most fateful in our

1217
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:34,950
history bugger shit shit

1218
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,280
I send to every household of my p-p-

1219
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,060
The ¡®P¡¯ is always difficult even when I¡¯m singing

1220
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,560
Bounce onto it 'a-peoples'

1221
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:54,460
¡°a-peoples both at home and overseas,...¡±

1222
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:55,730
Beautiful.

1223
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,800
¡°... this message, doo-dah, doodah....

1224
01:37:59,050 --> 01:38:00,960
spoken with the same depth of feeling...doodah

1225
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:04,990
for each one of you as if I able to fuck shit bugger

1226
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:09,570
cross your threshold and speak to you m-my - ...¡±

1227
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:12,620
In your head, now: ¡°I have a right to be bloody well heard!¡±

1228
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:14,290
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard,

1229
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:16,220
bloody well heard myself!

1230
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,600
Now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.

1231
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:25,070
¡°For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at wa - ...¡±

1232
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,100
Pause. ¡°we are...¡± Take a pause.

1233
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:28,600
I can¡¯t do this.

1234
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:33,990
Bertie, you can do it. Have a look at the last paragraph.

1235
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:35,800
Bertie...it¡¯s time.

1236
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,730
- Archbishop - Your Majesty

1237
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,270
A great moment, sir.

1238
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,150
- Prime Minister. - Your Majesty

1239
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:08,570
Nice to see you again, so soon.

1240
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,790
Good.. of you to be here, I¡¯m sure you¡¯ve had rather a busy day.

1241
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:23,730
Let¡¯s hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.

1242
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,420
Or the wretched dogs.

1243
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:32,230
- Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. - Your Majesty.

1244
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,050
The long walk.

1245
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:48,180
Good luck, Sir. I too dread this...apparatus.

1246
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:51,900
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.

1247
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:56,140
- I didn¡¯t. - Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1248
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:59,450
An operation was considered too dangerous.

1249
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:03,380
I eventually made an asset of it.

1250
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,100
- Thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.

1251
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,730
Darling

1252
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,090
How long, Logue?

1253
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:13,460
Just under three minutes, Sir.

1254
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:38,590
(5,4,3,check,2,1)

1255
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:45,630
Mr Wood.

1256
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,840
Good luck, Your Majesty.

1257
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:51,240
Mr Wood.

1258
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,940
- You¡¯ve redecorated, Logue. - I made it cozy.

1259
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:58,680
Some fresh air.

1260
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,250
There you are, darling.

1261
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:08,820
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles

1262
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:10,170
and a sieve on unsifted thistles..

1263
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:13,440
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles

1264
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:17,050
Bertie, darling, make sure it¡¯s not switched on!

1265
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,800
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I¡¯ve asked them to turn it off,

1266
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,260
because we don¡¯t want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.

1267
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:27,750
One minute, sir.

1268
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,220
I am sure you will be splendid.

1269
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:46,110
40 second, sir

1270
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:53,080
Logue, however this turns out,

1271
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:58,700
I don¡¯t know how to thank you for what you¡¯ve done.

1272
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:02,950
Knighthood?

1273
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:09,250
Twenty seconds.

1274
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,280
Forget everything else and just say it to me.

1275
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:23,390
Say it to me, as a friend.

1276
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:21,460
In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,

1277
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:33,030
I send to every household of my peoples,

1278
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:43,880
both at home and overseas

1279
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:55,770
this message

1280
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:04,030
spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you

1281
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:14,250
as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.

1282
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:27,760
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war.

1283
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:46,180
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out

1284
01:44:47,390 --> 01:45:00,200
of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.

1285
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:11,280
But it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict.

1286
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:18,660
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which,

1287
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:27,390
if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.

1288
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:36,400
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,

1289
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:50,650
is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.

1290
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:56,970
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear,

1291
01:45:58,150 --> 01:46:08,020
it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.

1292
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:21,520
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home

1293
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:31,290
and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.

1294
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:43,310
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.

1295
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:51,270
The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead,

1296
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:59,590
and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.

1297
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:04,980
But we can only do the right as we see the right

1298
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:14,370
and reverently commit our cause to God.

1299
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:24,610
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it,

1300
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:35,180
then, with God¡¯s help, we shall prevail.

1301
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,560
That was very good, Bertie.

1302
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:09,220
You still stammered on the ¡°w¡±.

1303
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:13,630
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.

1304
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:21,850
Congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.

1305
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:24,040
Thank you, Mr Wood.

1306
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,200
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1307
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,430
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1308
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:33,240
Thank you.

1309
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:46,520
- Ready? - Good

1310
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,210
Perfect

1311
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:54,140
Your first war time speech. Congratulation.

1312
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:59,240
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.

1313
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,620
Thank you, Logue.

1314
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:18,220
Well done. My friend.

1315
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:24,390
Thank you... Your Majesty.

1316
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:38,020
I knew you¡¯d be good.

1317
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,180
Thank you...

1318
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,030
...Lionel. (first time call Lionel)

1319
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:55,580
Onwards?

1320
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,080
Congratulations, Sir

1321
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:01,770
Couldn¡¯t have said it better myself, Sir

1322
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:04,760
Your Majesty, I¡¯m speechless.

1323
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,700
Congratulations, Sir

1324
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,570
Gentlemen.

1325
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,070
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?

1326
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:17,940
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.

1327
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:19,850
Bless you.

1328
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,440
And how about you, Margret?

1329
01:50:22,930 --> 01:50:24,580
You were just splendid, Papa.

1330
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:26,020
Of course I was.

1331
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,200
You¡¯re all ready?

1332
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,390
Come on girls.

1333
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:36,100
King George VI made Lionel Logue

1334
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,440
a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1944.

1335
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:41,490
This high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of

1336
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:46,410
the only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of personal service to the Monarch.

1337
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:50,270
Lionel was with the King for every wartime speech.

1338
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:56,230
Through his broadcasts, George VI became a symbol of national resistance.

1339
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:03,570
Lionel and Bertie remained friends for the rest of their lives.

1340
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:12,571
The End
