2
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:49,792
Tie it off, come on!

3
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:16,651
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

4
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:18,886
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

5
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:20,522
Stay close.

6
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:29,599
Here we are.

7
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,300
Get on his back.

8
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:52,889
Hurry up.

9
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:54,857
Whoa!

10
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:00,529
Ow!

11
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,630
Whoa!

12
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:06,967
There he is.
Go get him.

13
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,537
Oh, you'll pay
for that.

14
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,928
No. No, please.

15
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,866
Please, no.

16
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:33,956
Hold it there.

17
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,406
I only got one...

18
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:55,142
but he's a fine specimen.

19
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,884
- That's all?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,619
That shroom bit me twice.

21
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,789
Huh.

22
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:15,097
Tomb Bloom.

23
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,086
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

24
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,554
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,</i>

25
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,489
<i>for you may
remember this story...</i>

26
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:47,797
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

27
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,206
<i>For some reason,
the mistress of evil</i>

28
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,875
<i>and protector of the Moors...</i>

29
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:04,044
<i>was still hated
after all this time.</i>

30
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:07,014
<i>True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora...</i>

31
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,116
<i>but that was before
she found light</i>

32
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:11,018
<i>in the heart
of a human child...</i>

33
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,954
<i>and raised the girl
as her own.</i>

34
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,824
<i>After all,
it was Maleficent's love</i>

35
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:19,894
<i>which broke
that very same curse.</i>

36
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:24,164
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

37
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,466
<i>For as the tale was told</i>

38
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,803
<i>over and again
throughout the kingdom...</i>

39
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:33,809
<i>Maleficent became the villain
once more.</i>

40
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:48,656
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

41
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,790
It's the big day!

42
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:50,925
- Come on.
- Let's go!

43
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,927
Wake up. Wake up.

44
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,064
Come on.

45
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,877
Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!

46
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you both remember
the secret plan?

47
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,728
I've got it
all right here.

48
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,263
When do I tell the queen
the secret?

49
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,065
You must be patient,
Thistlewit.

50
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,933
Do you think Queen
Aurora's awake yet?

51
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,136
Well, she's not
"Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

52
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,672
I see what you did there.

53
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:54,221
Next item of business,
the missing fairies.

54
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,723
I've sent more sprites

55
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,825
to search
the Tomb Bloom field.

56
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,293
They'll report back to me
at nightfall.

57
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,697
We will keep searching
until we find them.

58
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,934
Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief.

59
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:10,072
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

60
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,341
Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side.

61
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:20,247
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

62
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:26,587
We must all learn
a little kindness.

63
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,721
Coming through.

64
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,156
Excuse us.

65
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,324
Official pixie business.

66
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,759
A word,
Your Majesty.

67
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,193
- Maybe two.
- Aunties...

68
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,629
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

69
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,664
- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace.

70
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,999
Not for a moment.

71
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,536
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

72
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:43,205
Is that...?

73
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:47,808
Pinto!

74
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,243
She's come
bearing gifts.

75
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:52,379
The first sap
from the warming trees.

76
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:54,348
It's for the big day!

77
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,916
Quiet, Thistlewit.

78
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:57,751
What big day?

79
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:01,323
Hey! My crown!

80
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:08,764
I'm not in the mood for this.

81
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:11,566
Pinto!

82
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,300
Whoa!

83
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,343
Come on.

84
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:25,379
Where are you going,
aunties?

85
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,882
Whoa!

86
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,053
I don't have time
for games, Pinto.

87
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,071
What's gotten
into all of you?

88
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,741
Oh. Uh-oh!

89
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:00,216
There she goes,
Your Majesty.

90
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:05,154
Come back here.

91
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,797
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

92
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:16,765
Look at me.

93
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,238
Oh.

94
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,206
Philip.
What are you doing here?

95
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,875
I was looking for you.

96
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,843
- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello.

97
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:32,079
I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now.

98
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,447
The Moors have turned
to madness.

99
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,015
I've got a castle
full of complaints.

100
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:37,050
- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!

101
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:38,352
I wanted to
ask you something.

102
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:39,419
Yes.

103
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:41,021
Do you think there
could be a union

104
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,691
between Ulstead
and the Moors?

105
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,292
A union?

106
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,060
To connect both lands.

107
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,463
To bring harmony
and peace.

108
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,333
I've been imagining a bridge.

109
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,269
Oh, a bridge.

110
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:55,269
Yes, a bridge.

111
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,771
A union's
a wonderful idea...

112
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,675
if both sides are willing.

113
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,810
Well, I'm working
on that part.

114
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,279
He's going to blow it.

115
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,348
Give him time.
He's warming up.

116
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:10,452
Wait.

117
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,956
That's your formal coat.

118
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,825
You're in on all of this,
aren't you?

119
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,294
If you're busy,
I could always come back.

120
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,196
No. No, no.

121
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,497
I'm not busy at all.

122
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,065
No, because I'd hate to...

123
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,433
Really. All ears.

124
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:27,770
What did you
want to talk about?

125
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,940
You're right.
He's blowing it.

126
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,810
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

127
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:39,048
I've decided to reclaim
this day for us.

128
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,782
I've loved you
since the moment I met you

129
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:43,116
and every day since.

130
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,520
If love has a truth,
here is mine.

131
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,055
There is no magic
nor curse

132
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:50,292
that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora.

133
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,562
Are you sure
this is a good time?

134
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:56,899
Oh, Philip.

135
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,434
Oh, he's on his knee.

136
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,904
He took his sweet
time about it.

137
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,773
Will you marry me?

138
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:08,108
Yes.

139
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,876
- Yes?
- Yes.

140
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,015
Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me.

141
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,927
We're having a wedding!

142
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,531
A secret surprise wedding.

143
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:35,137
Of course,
we have to tell our parents.

144
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,273
Do we?

145
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:10,937
Mistress.

146
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,372
What?

147
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:14,609
I have
a little bit of news.

148
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:17,411
Well, on with it.

149
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,379
It's nothing
of any real consequence...

150
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:23,450
and it's certainly
no reason to overreact.

151
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,087
It's just that...

152
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:28,322
Prince Philip has, um...

153
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:29,923
Disappeared?

154
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:32,926
No.
No. Philip has...

155
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,263
Yellow fever?
No, wait!

156
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,130
Leprosy!

157
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,466
No, Mistress.

158
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,402
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

159
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,139
Don't...

160
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,242
ruin my morning.

161
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,146
Mistress, please.

162
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,085
Stay calm!

163
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,058
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

164
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,393
am I to be a best man,

165
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:08,495
or did you choose a
creature from the Moors?

166
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,429
General,
if that's your way

167
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,232
of asking me if she said
yes, then I, uh...

168
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,301
I know
she said yes, sire.

169
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:17,037
What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?

170
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,639
What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?

171
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:21,475
"Moor folk"? Is that what
we're calling them now?

172
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,477
Winged beasts,
murderous trees.

173
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,345
Guard your tongue,
General.

174
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,647
You know nothing about them.

175
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,616
I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...

176
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:32,221
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

177
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:35,122
She's not like that.

178
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,524
It's my job to protect
this kingdom.

179
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,194
And I will do so,
old friend...

180
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,598
without hesitation.

181
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,299
Walk on.

182
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,506
Open the gates!

183
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,282
Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation

184
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:03,620
of the Midlands have arrived.

185
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,521
Weapons.

186
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,592
No. We have no need of arms.

187
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:12,461
Our days of war are over.

188
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:18,031
Ingrith...

189
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,233
you see where
I've had you placed.

190
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,236
Right behind me.

191
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,439
And that's
where I'll always be.

192
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:29,009
Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms.

193
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,246
One can never be too careful.

194
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,352
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

195
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,288
Is it, now?

196
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:48,462
- Father, Mother.
- Well?

197
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:49,531
What did she say?

198
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,465
She said yes.

199
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,300
Yes!

200
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:56,269
That is wonderful news. Oh!

201
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,039
Two kingdoms united
at last.

202
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,042
Yes.

203
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,581
Yes.

204
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,514
Perhaps I've
been selfish...

205
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,752
looking at this
the wrong way.

206
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,487
You've made your choice.

207
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,121
Now is a time to celebrate.

208
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,729
I'm glad
you finally approve.

209
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:22,830
Much more than that.

210
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:27,602
I am ready to welcome
your fiancee with open arms.

211
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:30,638
She shall come to dinner.

212
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,806
That would be incredible.

213
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,608
Under one condition.

214
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,610
She will bring her godmother.

215
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:36,777
Your Majesty, I strongly...

216
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,179
We will meet the one
who raised her

217
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,748
right here in this castle.

218
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,282
Yes.
The queen is right.

219
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,416
I'm not sure
her godmother will...

220
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,252
No, but I insist.

221
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:49,456
After all,
we will soon be family.

222
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,092
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

223
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:55,596
that my son
is to marry Aurora.

224
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,501
And Maleficent
is coming to dinner.

225
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,740
I shall send word
straightaway.

226
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:19,488
Oh!

227
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:27,229
Incoming.

228
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,669
Hold on to your petticoats!

229
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,782
Well, well.

230
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:49,786
So?

231
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:52,120
So.

232
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:56,726
Godmother...

233
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,699
Philip asked me to marry him.

234
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,432
Poor thing.

235
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,169
He'll recover.

236
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:11,206
My answer was yes.

237
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:16,376
- No.
- Yes.

238
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:17,510
No.

239
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:18,779
I wasn't really asking.

240
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:19,849
Nor was I.

241
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:22,215
What's next?

242
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,753
You'll turn him into a goat?

243
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:25,920
Hmm.

244
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,321
Stop.

245
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,423
Why don't you like Philip?

246
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,425
Well, for one thing,
he's human.

247
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,894
I'm a human.

248
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:36,799
And I have never
held that against you.

249
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,399
Until I fell in love.

250
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:44,705
Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty.

251
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:47,374
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

252
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,944
A very handsome
and charming prince.

253
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,884
I'm just asking you
to trust me.

254
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:58,953
Please give him a chance.

255
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,788
Let us prove you wrong.

256
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,857
Philip is thoughtful...

257
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:04,524
he's very kind...

258
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,661
Kind of what?

259
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:08,829
The king and queen
are celebrating tonight...

260
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:11,966
and they have invited
both of us to the castle.

261
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:17,303
You want me
to meet his parents?

262
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,407
It's just a dinner.

263
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:22,442
They don't want me
in Ulstead.

264
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:24,645
Why on earth would I go?

265
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:27,482
Because his mother
wishes to meet mine.

266
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,485
Please.

267
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,795
Philip.

268
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,397
I want you
to wear this tonight.

269
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,032
Your sword?

270
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:46,067
Because of you,

271
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,738
Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last.

272
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:53,874
Father,
my love for Aurora

273
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:55,643
has nothing to do
with politics.

274
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,978
Yes, but your love...

275
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,916
will ensure peace
for generations.

276
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:04,517
Now take it.
And wear it...

277
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,489
to know that you will
never have to use it.

278
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,593
Oh, my son.

279
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,463
I've never been more proud.

280
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,632
And what about Mother?

281
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:21,635
Is she okay with this?

282
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:25,742
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

283
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:20,897
Oh.

284
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:25,001
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

285
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:38,681
Oh.

286
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:43,552
I'm losing my patience.

287
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,619
Your Majesty.

288
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,421
You need to move faster,
Lickspittle.

289
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:49,623
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,428
Aurora said yes.

291
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,569
It's all coming together...

292
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,339
perfectly.

293
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:15,017
Hello.

294
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,787
Hello.

295
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,456
Hello.

296
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,393
Try it with
a little less fang.

297
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,497
How's this?

298
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,035
Try the greeting.

299
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:37,771
How kind of you
to invite me this evening.

300
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:40,641
Remember,
it's not a threat.

301
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:44,647
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

302
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:48,649
- Yeah. Better.
- Oh.

303
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:49,652
Try it with a curtsy.

304
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,589
We can skip that part.

305
00:21:58,227 --> 00:22:00,462
She really loves that boy,
you know.

306
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:04,000
You're doing her
a great kindness.

307
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:07,737
Kindness?

308
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:09,839
Mistress...

309
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:25,553
Doesn't she look lovely?

310
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,759
I have something for you.

311
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:32,762
Hmm?

312
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:36,531
For your horns.

313
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:38,866
I just thought
it might make

314
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:40,703
Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

315
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,470
And you, as well.

316
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,175
Maybe it's a bad idea.

317
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:49,812
No, it's...

318
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:52,815
It's all right.

319
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:04,024
I'm so excited.

320
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:07,194
Mmm... It's more
than I can bear.

321
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,701
It's Maleficent!

322
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,307
Pitchforks?

323
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,778
- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm.

324
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,751
- It's getting better.
- Hmm.

325
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,666
Anyone leaves
their post gets hung.

326
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,736
Yes, sir.

327
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,248
They're here.

328
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,855
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

329
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,158
I think I'd make
quite an impressive one.

330
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,726
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

331
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,329
Why are we
talking about bears?

332
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:51,000
Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors.

333
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:02,278
Thank you.

334
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,646
You look wonderful.

335
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:07,116
I'm so happy
to be here.

336
00:25:08,984 --> 00:25:11,687
Aurora, this is
truly an honor.

337
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:17,626
Welcome to Ulstead.

338
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,196
Such a beautiful girl.

339
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,767
I can see how you stole
Philip's heart.

340
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,137
Your Majesty.

341
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,973
The flowers
in your hair.

342
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:34,775
I'm allergic.

343
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:36,076
I'm so sorry.

344
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,278
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.

345
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,680
They're beautiful.

346
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:40,816
Presenting Maleficent.

347
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:55,129
Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again.

348
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:59,766
This is my father,
King John of Ulstead.

349
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,670
And my mother,
Queen Ingrith.

350
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:05,074
Welcome to our home.

351
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:13,180
It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

352
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:14,316
Don't smile.

353
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:20,954
And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.

354
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,725
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

355
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,426
Why would I have trouble?

356
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,198
Shoo!

357
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,466
He's making small talk.

358
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:34,670
I'll explain it later.

359
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,803
No trouble at all.

360
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,872
Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,

361
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:40,407
dinner is served.

362
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:43,777
Please, make yourselves
at home.

363
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,164
Hmm.

364
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:13,976
Bird.

365
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:17,479
Delicious.

366
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:27,790
Is there a problem?

367
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,325
It's iron.

368
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:33,961
Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,

369
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:35,264
she is averse to iron.

370
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,899
I had no idea.

371
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:41,270
Take it away at once.

372
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:49,445
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

373
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:54,081
Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?

374
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,482
It certainly is.

375
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:59,186
Shoo!

376
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:03,123
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

377
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:07,396
to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?

378
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:18,138
Oh, I simply can't wait

379
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,842
to have a little one running
through the castle again.

380
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,213
This castle?

381
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:27,516
Yes, of course.

382
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,352
This will be their home.

383
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:36,025
I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.

384
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,026
Yes, sir, I do.

385
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:41,495
Yes...

386
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:46,333
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

387
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,235
- I made her queen.
- Her castle is

388
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:49,637
quite stunning.
You must see it.

389
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,574
Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle.

390
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,277
Does she not?

391
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,878
Mother...

392
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,979
One in the Moors,

393
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:01,948
and one left behind
by her father.

394
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,552
King Stefan,
was it not?

395
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:08,857
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

396
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,627
So, you're also
a true princess.

397
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:15,028
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

398
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,865
Remind me, did he die
or was he killed?

399
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,968
Both.

400
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:24,071
Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently.

401
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:28,075
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

402
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:31,113
A baby cursed to sleep...

403
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,315
and never wake up.

404
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,116
Really?

405
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:37,517
Who would do
such a terrible thing

406
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,589
to an innocent child?

407
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:46,193
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

408
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:48,696
I'm sure
your kind would agree.

409
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:50,464
What do you mean,
my kind?

410
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,966
She means humans.

411
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:54,968
There are fairies missing
from the Moors.

412
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,536
What I'm missing
is some wine.

413
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:58,438
Stolen by human poachers.

414
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,006
That's the first
I've heard of it.

415
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,276
Someone gave the order.

416
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,320
It sounds as if
you're accusing the king.

417
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:14,087
No, she never said that.

418
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:16,556
Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?

419
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:17,958
Your Majesty,
I must report

420
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,192
that two peasants
were found dead...

421
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,161
just outside the Moors.

422
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,029
They'd been missing
for several days.

423
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,564
I see.

424
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, we all see.

425
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,468
The borders are open,

426
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,237
but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?

427
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,107
What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?

428
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:37,578
Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors...

429
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,348
and she's talking
about fairies.

430
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:45,753
Contain your animal.

431
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:47,655
Or I will.

432
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:53,594
If I didn't know better,

433
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:55,128
I'd say you were
making a threat.

434
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,296
Well, do you?

435
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,398
- Do I what?
- Know better?

436
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,533
Enough.

437
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:00,936
Put her down.

438
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:04,273
Please, put her down.

439
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:09,378
We're here to celebrate.

440
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:14,582
Forgive me, he's right.

441
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:16,684
Let's not forget
why we're here.

442
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:19,622
The start of a new life
for Aurora.

443
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:23,225
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

444
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:31,198
You have done an admirable
job, Maleficent...

445
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,237
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

446
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:37,738
But now...

447
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,408
Aurora will finally get...

448
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,680
the love of a real family.

449
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:46,179
A real mother.

450
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:49,549
Because the one thing
I regret...

451
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:52,419
is never having a daughter
of my own.

452
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:55,422
But tonight changes that.

453
00:31:55,424 --> 00:32:00,763
Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own.

454
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:16,443
Guards!

455
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:18,545
We have opened our home
to a witch!

456
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,192
Stop!

457
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,693
There is no union.

458
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:34,394
There will be no wedding.

459
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:37,264
- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!

460
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:39,099
Maleficent, please, stop now.

461
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,370
John, I'm so frightened.

462
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:42,837
Ah!

463
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,138
What has she done to me?

464
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:47,442
Father!

465
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:50,479
John!

466
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:52,414
We go home.

467
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:55,284
John!

468
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:57,452
It's a curse.

469
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:01,722
It's a curse!

470
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,660
Maleficent has cursed
the king!

471
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:07,695
What have you done?

472
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,531
I've done nothing.

473
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,769
Aurora, we go home now.

474
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:15,838
Aurora!

475
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,217
Aurora!

476
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,554
Wake him!

477
00:33:34,757 --> 00:33:36,593
Wake him, please.

478
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,410
Stand aside!

479
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:04,847
To the bedroom!

480
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:09,351
This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.

481
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:14,254
There must be a lesion.

482
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:15,388
Proof of her witchery.

483
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,358
Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity.

484
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,561
We all saw what Maleficent
did to him.

485
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:23,430
I'm so sorry.

486
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:26,769
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

487
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:31,438
All he wanted was peace.

488
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,607
This is all my fault.

489
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,812
You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear.

490
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:40,781
Maleficent is a threat
to everyone.

491
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:42,652
Especially you.

492
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:46,221
We'll do our best
to protect you.

493
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:49,424
There must be a way
to reverse this.

494
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,562
Mother, could you
try kissing him?

495
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:57,633
True love and all that.

496
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,804
I doubt
that would work.

497
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:05,338
It could save him.

498
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,975
- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother.

499
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:09,679
Very well.

500
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:22,790
You wanted peace...

501
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:25,795
now rest in peace forever.

502
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:36,804
I told you.

503
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:40,440
This is no fairy tale.

504
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:42,676
I have to return
to the Moors.

505
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:43,844
It's the only way.

506
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:45,345
Wait, wait. Come here.

507
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:46,847
I have to find her.

508
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:47,982
It's the middle
of the night.

509
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:49,850
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

510
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:51,919
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

511
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:54,354
No. You should stay
with your family.

512
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:55,625
You are my family.

513
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,760
Let her go, Philip.

514
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:01,998
Maybe she can save him.

515
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,753
Maleficent!

516
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,927
Maleficent!

517
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:14,168
Godmother!

518
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,445
Please come back.

519
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,651
She's not in the Moors.

520
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,020
Diaval.

521
00:38:32,722 --> 00:38:34,520
No one's seen her.

522
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,025
I'm so happy to see you.

523
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:39,161
She's nowhere to be found.

524
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,663
What if she
never comes back?

525
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:44,932
I could be stuck
as a human forever.

526
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,636
I have to find her.

527
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,507
She's the only one
who can break the curse.

528
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:53,869
Tell me she's dead.

529
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:57,271
The iron pierced her flesh.

530
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,942
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

531
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:04,745
Then where is her head?

532
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:07,014
There was something else.

533
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:09,283
Another creature.

534
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:12,786
It pulled her from
the depths of the sea.

535
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,489
What did it look like?

536
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:15,958
Her.

537
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,860
It carried her
up into the sky.

538
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:22,329
Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out

539
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,831
and now she's not alone.

540
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,534
We must be ready for war.

541
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:31,173
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

542
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,981
Stay inside!

543
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:47,890
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

544
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,787
If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead.

545
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:30,326
They tried to kill her
with this.

546
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:49,145
Do you hear it?

547
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:51,647
Do you hear it?

548
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:54,283
Huh?

549
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:57,019
It's a message
from the humans.

550
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,256
I hear it loud and clear.

551
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,324
Time for us to die.

552
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:08,128
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

553
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,764
And we are almost extinct
because of it.

554
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:12,266
Killing peasants
on the Moors

555
00:43:12,268 --> 00:43:15,068
will only lead
to more conflict, Borra.

556
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,803
They've pulled the iron
from the earth...

557
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:19,473
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

558
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:20,943
But this...

559
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,412
This will finish us.

560
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:27,414
Our people are safe
here for now.

561
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,116
But for how long?

562
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:31,020
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

563
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:33,921
I call for war.

564
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:37,124
I call for war!

565
00:43:37,126 --> 00:43:38,425
Right now!

566
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:41,430
There are
too many humans.

567
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,232
Too many kingdoms.

568
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:47,367
Conall,
they will keep finding

569
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,303
new ways to destroy us.

570
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:50,973
We can't win.

571
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,246
We can't win!

572
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,016
Not this way.

573
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:04,453
No. You're wrong, Conall.

574
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:08,891
We have something
they didn't plan on.

575
00:44:11,227 --> 00:44:13,095
We have her.

576
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:20,102
She holds powers
none of us possess.

577
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:23,872
She is wounded, Borra.

578
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:26,475
Who are you?

579
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,288
Hmm.

580
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:43,156
Hmm.

581
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,294
You reek of human.

582
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,329
Maybe I was wrong about you.

583
00:44:49,331 --> 00:44:51,465
Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead

584
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:52,935
at the bottom of the sea.

585
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,073
No.

586
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:01,510
It's there, isn't it?

587
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:04,380
It's inside you.

588
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:06,546
Mmm.

589
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:09,818
Ahhh!

590
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:24,500
You see?

591
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:31,104
You see what's inside her?

592
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,474
That is what will save us all.

593
00:45:52,528 --> 00:45:54,129
You saved me.

594
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,068
Come.

595
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:06,108
Let me show you who we are.

596
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:03,232
We're Dark Fey.

597
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,301
Same as you.

598
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:19,281
We're all that remain.

599
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:23,552
Unseen here,
far away from mankind.

600
00:47:24,186 --> 00:47:25,285
Look!

601
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:28,188
As more
human kingdoms emerged,

602
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,757
we went into hiding...

603
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,325
from every corner
of the earth...

604
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:35,495
doing what we had to,
to survive.

605
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:38,233
But many were lost.

606
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,323
Only a few
generations ago...

607
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:05,527
our kind roamed
every part of the world.

608
00:48:07,062 --> 00:48:08,395
The tundra.

609
00:48:08,397 --> 00:48:09,764
The forest.

610
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,266
The jungle.

611
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:17,239
The desert.

612
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:25,580
Now, our only refuge
is here...

613
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:27,380
in this cave.

614
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:29,483
Our nest of origin.

615
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:36,391
Listen.
Play in the wind.

616
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:39,194
Go!

617
00:48:59,348 --> 00:49:00,581
Those children
should be soaring

618
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,750
over the trees and rivers.

619
00:49:02,752 --> 00:49:04,687
Instead,
they are raised in exile.

620
00:49:05,387 --> 00:49:06,756
I could protect them.

621
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:11,424
How? By waging war
against the humans?

622
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:13,493
I've been at war with them
my whole life.

623
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,495
Not all of them.

624
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,767
There was one you raised
as your own.

625
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:23,370
Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans.

626
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:25,438
Maybe we can exist
without fear...

627
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,642
and war.

628
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:30,145
Find a way together.

629
00:49:31,748 --> 00:49:33,549
That will never happen.

630
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:03,211
Oh.

631
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:21,430
Whoa.

632
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,471
Whoa!

633
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:54,797
Ow! Oh.

634
00:50:55,564 --> 00:50:56,565
Huh?

635
00:51:05,675 --> 00:51:06,676
Gotcha!

636
00:51:11,848 --> 00:51:14,817
Welcome to your new home.

637
00:51:33,836 --> 00:51:36,371
We've been worried
about you, dear.

638
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:38,407
Your Majesty.

639
00:51:39,374 --> 00:51:41,408
I couldn't find her.

640
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,913
My heart breaks for you.

641
00:51:44,947 --> 00:51:47,414
She has brought
a cloud of darkness

642
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,483
upon your happiness.

643
00:51:49,585 --> 00:51:52,586
I know she was
against this marriage.

644
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:55,923
Never trusted your
instincts as a queen.

645
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:58,560
When I saw her at dinner...

646
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:02,632
with her horns covered...

647
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:06,736
bent cowering...

648
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:15,243
Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out.

649
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:18,378
I just don't know
what to do.

650
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,281
You do truly love him,
don't you?

651
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:22,618
My son.

652
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:24,219
Deeply.

653
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:27,957
It is love
that will heal you.

654
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,324
It's what heals us all.

655
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:34,529
Let's move
forward together...

656
00:52:35,397 --> 00:52:36,966
as a family.

657
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:56,483
<i>To all who live
on the Moors...</i>

658
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:00,621
What is that noise?

659
00:53:00,623 --> 00:53:02,388
<i>...and kingdoms
far and wide,</i>

660
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,724
<i>the king and queen
invite you...</i>

661
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:06,392
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

662
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:09,364
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

663
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:11,799
<i>All are welcome.</i>

664
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:12,802
Huh?

665
00:53:14,737 --> 00:53:17,472
<i>And all are expected!</i>

666
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:21,407
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

667
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:23,611
I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!

668
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:25,813
I always knew
I'd be invited.

669
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:28,749
Just glad you two
made the cut.

670
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,586
Who's getting married?

671
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:42,632
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

672
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,966
The queen is right.

673
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:48,736
We owe it to everyone...

674
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:50,907
especially the king.

675
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,776
What about Maleficent?

676
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:58,981
She's gone.

677
00:54:11,794 --> 00:54:13,459
The Phoenix.

678
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:15,731
It is said the Dark Fey
began with her...

679
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:19,068
evolved over centuries.

680
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:23,338
You are the last
of her descendants.

681
00:54:23,973 --> 00:54:26,474
Her blood is your own.

682
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,812
You are her.

683
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:36,717
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

684
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:39,554
destruction and rebirth.

685
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:43,423
But nature's greatest power

686
00:54:43,425 --> 00:54:46,561
is the power
of true transformation.

687
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:51,601
You transformed
when you raised Aurora.

688
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,803
When you found love...

689
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:58,875
in the middle of your pain.

690
00:55:00,643 --> 00:55:03,145
I'm asking you
to take all of your fury...

691
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,715
all of your pain...

692
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:08,849
and not use it.

693
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:12,088
Help us broker peace
with the humans.

694
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:15,890
Because peace...

695
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:20,495
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

696
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:32,006
The Moors are our last
true nature on earth.

697
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:36,110
And yet you named
a human as queen.

698
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,814
A daughter you cared for.

699
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:43,019
I have no daughter.

700
00:55:45,755 --> 00:55:48,024
She has chosen her side.

701
00:56:00,535 --> 00:56:02,703
We've just heard.

702
00:56:02,705 --> 00:56:05,473
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

703
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:09,743
Humans will come
from all over.

704
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,745
That's when we attack.

705
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,682
We'll kill the king
and queen of Ulstead...

706
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,686
and their young prince.

707
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:22,056
Their kingdom will fall.

708
00:56:22,058 --> 00:56:24,727
And the Fey will rise again.

709
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:43,112
The fairies made it.

710
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,764
I wore it when I
married the king.

711
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:11,240
I'm sure it's perfect.

712
00:57:11,874 --> 00:57:13,209
So am I.

713
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:22,049
Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely.

714
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:23,851
Considering
how she was raised.

715
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:26,820
By the same evil witch
who cursed her.

716
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:29,723
It's a miracle Prince
Philip came along.

717
00:57:29,725 --> 00:57:30,858
It's a miracle

718
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,695
the poor child is
alive at all.

719
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:35,996
Thank you so much.

720
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:36,864
It's exquisite.

721
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,263
<i>When I'm older...</i>

722
00:58:09,265 --> 00:58:11,100
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

723
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:14,703
Then we can
look after each other.

724
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,893
- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing.

725
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,697
Aurora, I know you
better than that.

726
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:45,734
This jewelry...

727
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:48,068
my hair...

728
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,204
all these rules.

729
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:53,941
I can't breathe.

730
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:56,910
I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore.

731
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:59,213
I feel like
a different person.

732
00:58:59,215 --> 00:59:01,081
Listen...

733
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:04,718
I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her.

734
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,253
You don't have to change.

735
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:08,357
I don't want you to change.

736
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:19,802
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

737
00:59:38,988 --> 00:59:40,222
Ah, yes.

738
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:43,325
Well...

739
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,426
Does it work?

740
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:48,228
I only have a handful

741
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,196
of fairy specimens
to work with...

742
00:59:49,198 --> 00:59:51,967
and the extraction process
is painstaking.

743
00:59:52,935 --> 00:59:54,737
Extraction from what?

744
00:59:55,738 --> 00:59:57,971
Tomb Bloom flowers.

745
00:59:57,973 --> 00:59:59,206
They grow from
a fairy's grave,

746
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:00,974
contain their very essence.

747
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,976
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

748
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,946
the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life.

749
01:00:05,948 --> 01:00:07,449
We will need thousands more.

750
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:10,786
Show me.

751
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,221
Show me.

752
01:00:14,223 --> 01:00:15,224
Very well.

753
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:19,459
So...

754
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:13,382
Finally,
the Moors will be mine.

755
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:17,184
No more fairies.

756
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:52,388
Stay alert, men.

757
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,238
Wow!

758
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,406
This is where
I found them.

759
01:02:12,408 --> 01:02:14,074
Excellent.

760
01:02:14,076 --> 01:02:15,909
But what if
the winged one returns?

761
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:17,846
Don't you worry about that.

762
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:19,913
We'll be ready.

763
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,050
Take the Tomb Blooms.

764
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:23,651
Get to work!

765
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,467
Sentries, stay alert!

766
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:41,937
Keep your weapons on hand.

767
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:03,959
Move it!

768
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:13,268
Maleficent...

769
01:03:56,278 --> 01:03:59,214
This is where
we bury our dead.

770
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:02,351
They've destroyed it.

771
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,456
This is what
the humans do.

772
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,992
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

773
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:13,529
We have to stop them.

774
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:19,466
You spent years
caring for a human...

775
01:04:19,468 --> 01:04:22,471
now it's time
to care for your own.

776
01:04:32,114 --> 01:04:33,148
Fire!

777
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:56,438
Reload! We go again!

778
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:02,745
Fire!

779
01:05:06,415 --> 01:05:09,017
Reload!
There's another one!

780
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:27,828
Everyone, stay together!

781
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,697
We're about to leave
the Moors.

782
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:31,398
Grab the hand or the wing...

783
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,703
or the tail of whoever
is closest to you.

784
01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:18,411
Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!

785
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:20,482
Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation.

786
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:24,317
- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there.

787
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,485
I'm with the bride.

788
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,554
We've been told to let
the, uh, other kind

789
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:28,689
find their seats first.

790
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:29,890
But I'm not a human.

791
01:07:29,892 --> 01:07:31,826
- I'm a raven.
- What?

792
01:07:31,828 --> 01:07:34,595
A raven. The black bird.

793
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:36,864
Mmm. This rice is delicious.

794
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:38,431
You're supposed
to throw it

795
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,634
at the bride and groom.

796
01:07:39,636 --> 01:07:42,302
What? And waste good rice?

797
01:07:42,304 --> 01:07:43,403
What's the hold up?

798
01:07:44,473 --> 01:07:45,640
Let me in!

799
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:47,610
Why can't humans come in, too?

800
01:07:49,344 --> 01:07:50,813
Why can't we come in?

801
01:07:58,286 --> 01:07:59,419
I know it's bad luck...

802
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,156
but I had to see you.

803
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:03,958
For you.

804
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,826
A Tomb Bloom?

805
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:06,894
Where did you get this?

806
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:08,663
From my mother.

807
01:08:08,665 --> 01:08:11,400
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

808
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:21,276
<i>From my mother.</i>

809
01:11:10,478 --> 01:11:12,146
Where should we sit, Flittle?

810
01:11:12,148 --> 01:11:14,181
On the left.
We're with the bride.

811
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:15,916
Yes, we are.

812
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:17,785
But the groom's lovely, too.

813
01:11:17,787 --> 01:11:19,589
Mmm. Yes, he is.

814
01:11:20,522 --> 01:11:22,156
I'm with both.

815
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:24,392
Huh?

816
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:32,869
Now.

817
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,125
What's this?

818
01:11:58,127 --> 01:11:59,994
Nobody is allowed in here
except me.

819
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:02,798
And I'm already here,
so go away!

820
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:22,550
Maleficent, please stop.

821
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:31,491
Maleficent.

822
01:12:31,493 --> 01:12:32,828
She didn't do it.

823
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:37,600
Get out!

824
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:40,566
Before I call the guards!

825
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,009
The missing fairies.

826
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:50,543
I said get out.
Did you hear me?

827
01:12:50,545 --> 01:12:53,180
What have you done?

828
01:12:57,519 --> 01:12:59,219
You're a pixie.

829
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,788
How dare you call me that?

830
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,890
I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman...

831
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:04,694
and I serve the queen.

832
01:13:05,527 --> 01:13:07,663
She took your wings.

833
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,200
We have to release them.

834
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:15,002
They belong on the Moors.

835
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:16,070
As you do, Aurora.

836
01:13:18,107 --> 01:13:21,644
A human who has betrayed
her kind.

837
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,184
You put the curse
on the king.

838
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:32,252
Oh, dear.

839
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:34,855
You may be queen...

840
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:36,657
but you are very young.

841
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:39,760
Ruling humans is a bit
more complicated...

842
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:43,632
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

843
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:48,536
When I was young...

844
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,773
my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors.

845
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:57,111
And one particularly
harsh winter...

846
01:13:57,113 --> 01:13:58,946
our crops died...

847
01:13:58,948 --> 01:14:02,683
and the people
began to suffer.

848
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:05,285
And as we looked
over our walls...

849
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:09,656
we could see
the fairies thriving.

850
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,593
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

851
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:17,700
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

852
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:20,667
Choosing peace
over our people,

853
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:23,003
he sent my brother
to do his bidding.

854
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,107
He never came back.

855
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:28,208
Those savages...

856
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,843
creatures who could
barely grunt,

857
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,214
let alone engage in talks,
killed him.

858
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:34,615
I don't believe that.

859
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:35,983
Our people became fearful.

860
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:38,819
They overthrew my father.

861
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:42,689
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

862
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:47,628
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

863
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,363
Another weak king

864
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:52,099
speaking of
tolerance and civility.

865
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:54,701
And now, my own son...

866
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:58,705
corrupted with visions
of harmony.

867
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:01,077
But peace
will not be our downfall.

868
01:15:06,148 --> 01:15:07,983
Now lock her up.

869
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:11,087
A war is coming.

870
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:18,894
No! No!

871
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:29,772
I wish you could be here
with me.

872
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:40,349
Conall wanted peace...

873
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:45,321
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

874
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:49,225
Now, we will have our war.

875
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:54,461
Our fight begins now!

876
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:57,264
We will rise together!

877
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:59,833
We fight together.

878
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:04,204
And we will show them
no mercy!

879
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:23,259
Come on! Go!

880
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:30,731
Go! Go!

881
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:33,235
Go! Go! Go!

882
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:49,082
Where are all Philip's guests?

883
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:51,253
- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm.

884
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,216
Start the music.

885
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,800
Come on! Come on!

886
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:44,867
She's gone.

887
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:47,403
Hey!

888
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,316
It's a trap! Get down!

889
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,436
Your Majesty...

890
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:24,039
they're coming from the sea.

891
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:34,915
She escaped!

892
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:43,359
Down this way, come on!

893
01:19:51,033 --> 01:19:52,499
Your Highness.

894
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:54,036
Upon my command.

895
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:06,246
Check every room!

896
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:09,318
She can't be far!

897
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:43,285
Wait.

898
01:20:44,654 --> 01:20:45,988
Wait.

899
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:11,313
What's going on?

900
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,050
Now.

901
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,151
Fire!

902
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:28,729
No!

903
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,526
They look just like her.

904
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,263
Withdraw!

905
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:05,300
Withdraw!

906
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:08,168
Pull back!

907
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,604
Maleficent's
starting a war.

908
01:22:09,606 --> 01:22:12,072
First my father,
and now this.

909
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:14,341
Philip!
She didn't curse him.

910
01:22:14,343 --> 01:22:16,443
- Maleficent.
- What?

911
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:18,213
She never cursed him.

912
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:21,147
It was your mother.

913
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:22,449
What are you saying?

914
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:23,620
It was the spindle.

915
01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:30,758
The curse is still in it.

916
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,462
Your mother used it
against your father.

917
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:36,599
Look.

918
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:40,801
It's the same.

919
01:22:40,803 --> 01:22:43,570
She's locked the Moor folk
in the chapel.

920
01:22:43,572 --> 01:22:44,872
This isn't a wedding.

921
01:22:44,874 --> 01:22:47,075
It's a trap.

922
01:22:51,648 --> 01:22:54,182
Remember where
you came from.

923
01:22:54,851 --> 01:22:57,152
Remember who you are.

924
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,291
I've made my choice.

925
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:05,394
You'll have to make yours.

926
01:23:33,623 --> 01:23:35,257
Stay low!

927
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:38,595
Divide!

928
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:42,431
Follow me!

929
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:52,441
Attack!

930
01:23:53,743 --> 01:23:55,408
Attack!

931
01:24:06,388 --> 01:24:08,190
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

932
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:19,468
No!

933
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,280
Aunties! Aunties!

934
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,719
It's too heavy!

935
01:25:10,987 --> 01:25:12,485
Aurora!

936
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:13,656
Diaval! You're here.

937
01:25:16,893 --> 01:25:18,661
Oh, what's happening?

938
01:25:39,015 --> 01:25:40,482
Weapon change!

939
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:43,586
Weapon change! Go!

940
01:26:23,893 --> 01:26:24,894
Mother!

941
01:26:25,828 --> 01:26:27,460
You have to stop this.

942
01:26:27,462 --> 01:26:28,963
We are at war.

943
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:30,998
This isn't a war.
It's a massacre.

944
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,733
Philip,
you don't understand.

945
01:26:32,735 --> 01:26:35,603
These creatures stand
between us...

946
01:26:35,605 --> 01:26:38,404
and everything
we need to survive.

947
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:39,740
You're wrong.

948
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:41,374
We can stand together.

949
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:44,078
Well, you're a fool
to believe that.

950
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,516
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

951
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,685
You lied to me.

952
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,820
I am protecting the kingdom...

953
01:26:52,822 --> 01:26:55,555
and your throne.

954
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:56,726
What about Father?

955
01:26:58,426 --> 01:27:01,463
Were you protecting him, too?

956
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:06,068
The prince
is not feeling well.

957
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:09,105
See him to his chambers.

958
01:27:12,975 --> 01:27:13,976
Now.

959
01:27:18,581 --> 01:27:19,749
Sire, stop!

960
01:27:46,676 --> 01:27:49,076
Yield! Yield!

961
01:27:49,078 --> 01:27:50,144
My mother cursed the king

962
01:27:50,146 --> 01:27:51,444
so she could destroy
the Moor folk.

963
01:27:51,446 --> 01:27:53,581
Your men are paying
heavily for it.

964
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:02,923
We have to do something!

965
01:28:06,428 --> 01:28:07,828
Goodbye, girls.

966
01:28:09,031 --> 01:28:11,131
No, come back!

967
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:12,935
Flittle! No!

968
01:28:25,615 --> 01:28:26,981
No!

969
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:28,851
Hey, you,
stay with your own!

970
01:28:29,551 --> 01:28:31,118
Run, Aurora, run!

971
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,920
Let him go!

972
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:39,629
No! No!

973
01:29:06,756 --> 01:29:08,622
Godmother.

974
01:30:06,816 --> 01:30:08,649
For Flittle!

975
01:30:17,026 --> 01:30:19,561
We've got her!

976
01:30:34,143 --> 01:30:35,144
Huh?

977
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:08,108
Go! Go!

978
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,844
This way! This way!

979
01:31:10,846 --> 01:31:11,847
Go!

980
01:31:55,057 --> 01:31:56,358
Stand down!

981
01:31:58,194 --> 01:32:00,360
This is not my fight.

982
01:32:00,362 --> 01:32:02,998
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

983
01:32:04,834 --> 01:32:07,736
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

984
01:32:26,055 --> 01:32:27,890
There will be no Fey blood
on my hands.

985
01:32:49,845 --> 01:32:51,879
This way!
This way!

986
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:55,851
Maleficent's back!

987
01:33:00,389 --> 01:33:02,958
She's going for the queen.

988
01:33:08,764 --> 01:33:10,764
Yield! Yield!

989
01:33:10,766 --> 01:33:11,899
Stand down!

990
01:33:11,901 --> 01:33:13,169
Lower your weapons!

991
01:33:25,414 --> 01:33:28,250
There's the evil
that I promised them.

992
01:33:31,921 --> 01:33:34,423
Your kind is more predictable
than humans.

993
01:33:41,063 --> 01:33:42,064
Stop!

994
01:33:42,965 --> 01:33:44,031
Stop!

995
01:33:44,033 --> 01:33:46,135
Well, almost.

996
01:33:46,402 --> 01:33:47,768
Stop.

997
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:51,038
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

998
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,006
There's another way.

999
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:54,176
I know who you are.

1000
01:33:56,812 --> 01:33:59,081
I know you.

1001
01:33:59,515 --> 01:34:01,181
You do not.

1002
01:34:03,452 --> 01:34:05,821
Yes, I do.

1003
01:34:06,288 --> 01:34:08,157
You're my mother.

1004
01:34:43,259 --> 01:34:44,493
No!

1005
01:35:00,309 --> 01:35:02,911
Do you know what makes a great
leader, Aurora?

1006
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:07,347
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

1007
01:35:07,349 --> 01:35:08,616
and then use that fear...

1008
01:35:08,618 --> 01:35:09,818
Your Majesty.

1009
01:35:11,287 --> 01:35:13,520
...against your enemies.

1010
01:35:13,522 --> 01:35:16,290
So...

1011
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:19,893
I spread the story
of the evil witch...

1012
01:35:19,895 --> 01:35:23,397
and the princess she cursed.

1013
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:27,202
It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty.

1014
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:30,203
They were all terrified.

1015
01:35:30,205 --> 01:35:33,309
And the story became legend.

1016
01:35:35,578 --> 01:35:38,278
I know you think
I'm a monster.

1017
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,252
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

1018
01:35:44,086 --> 01:35:47,187
I did for Ulstead.

1019
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:49,956
You are a traitor
to your kind,

1020
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,560
and you will pay for it.

1021
01:35:52,595 --> 01:35:54,897
Maleficent is dead!

1022
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,068
We will never again
live in fear!

1023
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:02,471
Get back here!

1024
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:08,643
Ulstead is free at last!

1025
01:36:08,645 --> 01:36:11,480
Let me go!

1026
01:36:20,155 --> 01:36:21,256
What's happening?

1027
01:39:46,829 --> 01:39:48,698
Well, well.

1028
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:51,801
Hello, Beasty.

1029
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:11,553
I missed you.

1030
01:40:13,355 --> 01:40:14,757
Did you bump
your head, then?

1031
01:40:15,357 --> 01:40:16,556
I did.

1032
01:40:19,461 --> 01:40:20,730
Philip.

1033
01:40:21,296 --> 01:40:22,632
Yes?

1034
01:40:24,499 --> 01:40:26,368
Do you love my daughter?

1035
01:40:29,371 --> 01:40:30,607
With everything I have.

1036
01:40:39,816 --> 01:40:41,149
Good.

1037
01:40:49,759 --> 01:40:52,862
I believe this belongs to you.

1038
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:01,802
Curses don't end.

1039
01:41:01,804 --> 01:41:03,572
They're broken.

1040
01:41:28,898 --> 01:41:30,700
It ends.

1041
01:41:36,839 --> 01:41:39,372
There will be
no more fighting.

1042
01:41:39,374 --> 01:41:41,942
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

1043
01:41:41,944 --> 01:41:43,378
And from this day on...

1044
01:41:44,013 --> 01:41:46,714
we move forward...

1045
01:41:46,716 --> 01:41:49,184
and find our way...

1046
01:41:50,252 --> 01:41:51,587
in peace.

1047
01:41:51,988 --> 01:41:53,555
Together.

1048
01:41:56,826 --> 01:41:59,627
Today,
there will be a wedding.

1049
01:41:59,629 --> 01:42:03,030
Not just a union
of two people...

1050
01:42:03,032 --> 01:42:06,366
but a union of two kingdoms.

1051
01:42:06,368 --> 01:42:07,770
And all are invited...

1052
01:42:08,838 --> 01:42:10,938
all are safe...

1053
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:13,373
and all are welcome.

1054
01:42:47,442 --> 01:42:49,244
Hello, there.

1055
01:43:30,019 --> 01:43:33,120
We cannot live
amongst monsters...

1056
01:43:38,628 --> 01:43:41,764
Someone should
really cover those horns.

1057
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:00,616
If only Conall could see you.

1058
01:44:02,752 --> 01:44:03,753
Borra...

1059
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:08,555
it's time to come home.

1060
01:44:14,664 --> 01:44:15,965
Hello.

1061
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:19,602
Can you come here?

1062
01:44:29,946 --> 01:44:31,080
Yes?

1063
01:44:33,015 --> 01:44:34,851
Will you give me away?

1064
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:36,719
Never.

1065
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:39,820
No.

1066
01:44:39,822 --> 01:44:41,389
Will you walk me
down the aisle?

1067
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,558
Ah.

1068
01:44:45,895 --> 01:44:46,896
Yes.

1069
01:45:10,152 --> 01:45:12,520
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

1070
01:45:24,834 --> 01:45:25,835
Is that...?

1071
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:28,536
She can change her back.

1072
01:45:29,205 --> 01:45:30,638
I suppose.

1073
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:34,808
Only if we wanted to.

1074
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,476
Father.

1075
01:45:40,983 --> 01:45:43,250
I'm so glad to see you.

1076
01:45:43,252 --> 01:45:45,619
I've dreamed
of this moment.

1077
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:48,521
Two kingdoms
united at last.

1078
01:45:48,523 --> 01:45:51,258
And it's because of you.

1079
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:54,194
I'm so proud of you.
So proud.

1080
01:46:23,159 --> 01:46:24,725
She looks better
in green.

1081
01:46:24,727 --> 01:46:25,828
Pink, you mean.

1082
01:46:29,098 --> 01:46:30,199
No, in green.

1083
01:46:30,933 --> 01:46:31,999
Pink.

1084
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:33,235
- Green.
- Pink.

1085
01:46:36,571 --> 01:46:38,005
Flittle!

1086
01:46:38,007 --> 01:46:40,242
It's perfect.

1087
01:47:24,754 --> 01:47:26,589
Let her go.

1088
01:47:40,102 --> 01:47:42,903
Pull yourself together.

1089
01:47:42,905 --> 01:47:46,106
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1090
01:47:46,108 --> 01:47:47,810
divided by fear.

1091
01:47:48,711 --> 01:47:50,744
Today, you teach us

1092
01:47:50,746 --> 01:47:53,881
we are not defined
by where we are from...

1093
01:47:53,883 --> 01:47:56,052
but by whom we love.

1094
01:47:58,087 --> 01:47:59,755
The bands, please.

1095
01:48:15,337 --> 01:48:17,171
Do you, Philip,
take Aurora...

1096
01:48:17,173 --> 01:48:17,973
I do.

1097
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,108
And do you,
Aurora, take...

1098
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:22,810
I do.

1099
01:48:22,812 --> 01:48:26,680
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1100
01:48:26,682 --> 01:48:28,717
You may kiss the bride.

1101
01:48:59,348 --> 01:49:00,447
You're smiling.

1102
01:49:23,339 --> 01:49:25,074
It's a new day.

1103
01:49:27,476 --> 01:49:29,245
It is.

1104
01:49:40,923 --> 01:49:41,957
Morning.

1105
01:49:42,858 --> 01:49:45,058
Will you stay awhile?

1106
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,793
A little while.

1107
01:49:46,795 --> 01:49:48,829
But don't worry...

1108
01:49:48,831 --> 01:49:51,233
I'll see you
at the christening.

1109
01:50:08,317 --> 01:50:09,318
Hmm.

1110
01:50:10,519 --> 01:50:12,121
Hmm.

1111
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:13,746
