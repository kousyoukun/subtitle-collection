1
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,883
Tie it off, come on!

2
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,534
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

3
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,828
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

4
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,538
Stay close.

5
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,631
Here we are.

6
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,258
Get on his back.

7
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,987
Hurry up.

8
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,918
There he is. Go get him.

9
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,545
You'll pay for that.

10
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,854
No. No, please.

11
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,939
Please, no.

12
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,047
Hold it there.

13
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,191
I only got one...

14
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,193
but he's a fine specimen.

15
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,451
-That's all?
-Yeah.

16
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,328
That shroom bit me twice.

17
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,213
Tomb Bloom.

18
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,029
Once upon a time...

19
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,283
or perhaps twice upon a time,
for you may remember this story...

20
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,829
there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.

21
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:55,045
МАLEFICENT: MISTRESS OF EVIL

22
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,759
For some reason, the mistress of evil
and protector of the Moors...

23
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,928
was still hated after all this time.

24
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,931
True, she had cursed the princess,
Aurora...

25
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,935
but that was before she found light
in the heart of a human child...

26
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,855
and raised the girl as her own.

27
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:19,778
After all, it was Maleficent's love
which broke that very same curse.

28
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,115
But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.

29
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:29,662
For as the tale was told
over and again throughout the kingdom...

30
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,833
Maleficent became the villain once more.

31
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,556
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

32
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,809
-It's the big day! Let's go!
-Come on.

33
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,560
Wake up. Wake up.

34
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,146
Come on.

35
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,327
Hurry up, wallerbogs! It's time!

36
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,844
Do you both remember the secret plan?

37
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,222
I've got it all right here.
When do I tell the queen the secret?

38
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,974
You must be patient, Thistlewit.

39
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,809
Do you think Queen Aurora's awake yet?

40
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,146
Well, she's not "Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

41
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,773
I see what you did there.

42
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,830
Next item of business, the missing fairies.

43
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,667
I've sent more sprites
to search the Tomb Bloom field.

44
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,252
They'll report back to me at nightfall.

45
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,671
We will keep searching until we find them.

46
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,801
Please don't raise your roots at me, Lief.

47
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,138
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

48
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,392
Diaval, you're supposed to be on my side.

49
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,315
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

50
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,820
We must all learn a little kindness.

51
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
Coming through.

52
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,074
Excuse us.

53
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,283
Official pixie business.

54
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,576
A word, Your Majesty.

55
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,119
-Maybe two.
-Aunties...

56
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,413
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

57
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,457
-No!
-This can't wait, Your Grace.

58
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,875
Not for a moment.

59
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,461
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

60
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,296
Is that...?

61
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,634
Pinto!

62
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,347
She's come bearing gifts.
The first sap from the warming trees.

63
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,640
It's for the big day!

64
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,600
Quiet, Thistlewit.

65
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,310
What big day?

66
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,439
Hey! My crown!

67
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,738
I'm not in the mood for this.

68
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,491
Pinto!

69
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
Come on.

70
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,422
Where are you going, aunties?

71
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,094
I don't have time for games, Pinto.

72
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,031
What's gotten into all of you?

73
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,290
There she goes, Your Majesty.

74
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,211
Come back here.

75
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,763
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

76
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,723
Look at me.

77
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,107
Philip. What are you doing here?

78
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,525
I was looking for you.

79
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,652
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

80
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,946
I'm really sorry, I can't talk right now.

81
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,866
The Moors have turned to madness.
I've got a castle full of complaints.

82
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,201
I know how busy you are.

83
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,995
-I wanted to ask you something.
-Yes.

84
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,624
Do you think there could be a union
between Ulstead and the Moors?

85
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,001
A union?

86
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,920
To connect both lands.

87
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,214
To bring harmony and peace.

88
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,424
I've been imagining a bridge.

89
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,343
A bridge.

90
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,178
Yes, a bridge.

91
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,555
A union's a wonderful idea...

92
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
if both sides are willing.

93
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,603
Well, I'm working on that part.

94
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,188
He's going to blow it.

95
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,439
Give him time. He's warming up.

96
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,568
Wait.

97
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,947
That's your formal coat.

98
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,867
You're in on all of this, aren't you?

99
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,203
If you're busy, I could always come back.

100
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,080
No. No, no.

101
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm not busy at all.

102
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,916
No, because I'd hate to...

103
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,711
Really. All ears.
What did you want to talk about?

104
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,922
You're right.
He's blowing it.

105
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,759
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

106
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,055
I've decided to reclaim this day for us.

107
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,726
I've loved you since the moment I met you
and every day since.

108
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,479
If love has a truth, here is mine.

109
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,358
There is no magic nor curse that could
ever tear me away from you, Aurora.

110
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,865
-Are you sure this is a good time?
-Philip.

111
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,368
He's on his knee.

112
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,870
He took his sweet time about it.

113
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,706
Will you marry me?

114
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,917
Yes.

115
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,669
-Yes?
-Yes.

116
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,670
Yes!

117
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,006
Yes, just stand up. Kiss me.

118
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,893
We're having a wedding!

119
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,647
A secret surprise wedding.

120
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,153
Of course, we have to tell our parents.

121
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,240
Do we?

122
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,397
Mistress.

123
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,898
What?

124
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,192
I have a little bit of news.

125
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,486
Well, on with it.

126
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,280
It's nothing of any real consequence...

127
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,118
and it's certainly no reason to overreact.

128
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,078
It's just that...

129
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,706
Prince Philip has...

130
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,541
Disappeared?

131
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,711
No. No. Philip has...

132
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,295
Yellow fever? No, wait!

133
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,881
Leprosy!

134
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,675
No, Mistress.

135
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,303
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

136
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,139
Don't...

137
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,267
ruin my morning.

138
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,146
Mistress, please.

139
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,067
Stay calm!

140
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,868
So, tell me, sire...

141
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,413
am I to be a best man,
or did you choose a creature from the Moors?

142
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,083
General, if that's your way of asking me
if she said yes, then I...

143
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,169
I know she said yes, sire.

144
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,838
What human wouldn't want to leave that place?

145
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,590
What do you have against Moor folk, Percival?

146
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,009
"Moor folk"?
Is that what we're calling them now?

147
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,386
Winged beasts, murderous trees.

148
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,221
Guard your tongue, General.

149
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,598
You know nothing about them.

150
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,558
I know that Maleficent is a killer of men...

151
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,228
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

152
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,939
She's not like that.

153
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,442
It's my job to protect this kingdom.

154
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,194
And I will do so, old friend...

155
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,696
without hesitation.

156
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,990
Walk on.

157
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,580
Open the gates!

158
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,718
Your Majesty, spoils from the annexation
of the Midlands have arrived.

159
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,595
Weapons.

160
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,683
No. We have no need of arms.

161
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,519
Our days of war are over.

162
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,357
Ingrith...

163
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,236
you see where I've had you placed.
Right behind me.

164
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,948
And that's where I'll always be.

165
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,410
Ingrith, I said we had no need of arms.

166
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,246
One can never be too careful.

167
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,129
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

168
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,256
Is it, now?

169
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,346
-Father, Mother.
-Well?

170
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,806
What did she say?

171
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,224
She said yes.

172
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,517
Yes!

173
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,104
That is wonderful news.

174
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,898
Two kingdoms united at last.

175
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,983
Yes.

176
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,654
Yes.

177
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,407
Perhaps I've been selfish...

178
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,868
looking at this the wrong way.

179
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,079
You've made your choice.

180
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,873
Now is a time to celebrate.

181
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,671
I'm glad you finally approve.

182
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,006
Much more than that.

183
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:27,302
I am ready to welcome your fiancée
with open arms.

184
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,555
She shall come to dinner.

185
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,765
That would be incredible.

186
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,516
Under one condition.

187
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,060
She will bring her godmother.

188
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,728
Your Majesty, I strongly...

189
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,690
We will meet the one who raised her
right here in this castle.

190
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,108
Yes. The queen is right.

191
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm not sure her godmother will...

192
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,070
No, but I insist.

193
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:49,324
After all, we will soon be family.

194
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,868
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

195
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:56,039
that my son is to marry Aurora.

196
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,542
And Maleficent is coming to dinner.

197
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,838
I shall send word straightaway.

198
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,195
Incoming.

199
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,742
Hold on to your petticoats!

200
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,880
Well, well.

201
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,884
So?

202
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,053
So.

203
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,808
Godmother...

204
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,772
Philip asked me to marry him.

205
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,275
Poor thing.

206
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,110
He'll recover.

207
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,156
My answer was yes.

208
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:14,993
No.

209
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,202
Yes.

210
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,328
No.

211
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,705
I wasn't really asking.

212
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,956
Nor was I.

213
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,000
What's next?

214
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,835
You'll turn him into a goat?

215
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,589
Stop.

216
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,258
Why don't you like Philip?

217
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,260
Well, for one thing, he's human.

218
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,845
I'm a human.

219
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,890
And I have never held that against you.

220
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,225
Until I fell in love.

221
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,521
Love doesn't always end well, Beasty.

222
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,192
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

223
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,986
A very handsome and charming prince.

224
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,576
I'm just asking you to trust me.

225
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,870
Please give him a chance.

226
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,705
Let us prove you wrong.

227
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,791
Philip is thoughtful...

228
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,334
he's very kind...

229
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,794
Kind of what?

230
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,755
The king and queen are celebrating tonight...

231
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,383
and they have invited both of us
to the castle.

232
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:16,721
You want me to meet his parents?

233
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,390
It's just a dinner.

234
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,268
They don't want me in Ulstead.

235
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,229
Why on earth would I go?

236
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,482
Because his mother wishes to meet mine.

237
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,485
Please.

238
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,120
Philip.

239
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,372
I want you to wear this tonight.

240
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,000
Your sword?

241
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,795
Because of you,
Ulstead and the Moors will be united at last.

242
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,510
Father, my love for Aurora
has nothing to do with politics.

243
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,929
Yes, but your love...

244
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:01,850
will ensure peace for generations.

245
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,352
Now take it. And wear it...

246
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,480
to know that you will never have to use it.

247
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,608
My son.

248
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,446
I've never been more proud.

249
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,491
And what about Mother?

250
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,785
Is she okay with this?

251
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,790
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

252
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,100
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

253
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,535
I'm losing my patience.

254
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,286
Your Majesty.

255
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,206
You need to move faster, Lickspittle.

256
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,416
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,378
Aurora said yes.

258
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,552
It's all coming together...

259
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,264
perfectly.

260
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,108
Hello.

261
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,819
Hello.

262
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,406
Hello.

263
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,326
Try it with a little less fang.

264
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,456
How's this?

265
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,126
Try the greeting.

266
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,630
How kind of you to invite me this evening.

267
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,674
Remember, it's not a threat.

268
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,637
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

269
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,599
Yeah. Better.

270
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,642
Try it with a curtsy.

271
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,563
We can skip that part.

272
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,403
She really loves that boy, you know.

273
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,074
You're doing her a great kindness.

274
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,744
Kindness?

275
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,871
Mistress...

276
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,512
Doesn't she look lovely?

277
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,559
I have something for you.

278
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,481
For your horns.

279
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,694
I just thought it might make Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

280
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,404
And you, as well.

281
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,951
Maybe it's a bad idea.

282
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,828
No, it's...

283
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,831
It's all right.

284
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,633
I'm so excited.

285
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,053
It's more than I can bear.

286
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,675
It's Maleficent!

287
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,224
Pitchforks?

288
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,143
Humans are hilarious.

289
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,733
It's getting better.

290
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,710
-Anyone leaves their post gets hung.
-Yes, sir.

291
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,347
They're here.

292
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,690
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

293
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,067
I think I'd make quite an impressive one.

294
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,485
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

295
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,445
Why are we talking about bears?

296
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,032
Presenting Queen Aurora of the Moors.

297
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,377
Thank you.

298
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:07,173
-You look wonderful.
-I'm so happy to be here.

299
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,636
Aurora, this is truly an honor.

300
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,559
Welcome to Ulstead.

301
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,563
Such a beautiful girl.

302
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,733
I can see how you stole Philip's heart.

303
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,194
Your Majesty.

304
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,367
The flowers in your hair. I'm allergic.

305
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:35,952
I'm so sorry.

306
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,456
Oh, no. No, no. It's all right.
They're beautiful.

307
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,790
Presenting Maleficent.

308
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,096
Maleficent, it's wonderful to see you again.

309
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,559
This is my father, King John of Ulstead.

310
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,603
And my mother, Queen Ingrith.

311
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,106
Welcome to our home.

312
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,614
It's so very kind of you to invite me
this evening.

313
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,407
Don't smile.

314
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,704
And I would like to introduce you to Diaval.

315
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,501
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

316
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,336
Why would I have trouble?

317
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,258
He's making small talk.

318
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,594
I'll explain it later.

319
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,596
No trouble at all.

320
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,974
Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

321
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,645
Please, make yourselves at home.

322
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:13,967
Bird.

323
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,595
Delicious.

324
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,731
Is there a problem?

325
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,026
It's iron.

326
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,321
Majesty, as you are sensitive to flowers,
she is averse to iron.

327
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,700
I had no idea.

328
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,327
Take it away at once.

329
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,544
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

330
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,840
Such a warm spell of weather, isn't it?

331
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,467
It certainly is.

332
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,974
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

333
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,811
to celebrate their
glorious future together.

334
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,783
I simply can't wait to have a little one
running through the castle again.

335
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,081
This castle?

336
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,624
Yes, of course.

337
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,961
This will be their home.

338
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,007
I hear Aurora has a castle of her own.

339
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,843
Yes, sir, I do.

340
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,387
Yes...

341
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:46,184
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

342
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,519
I made her queen.

343
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,604
Her castle is quite stunning.
You must see it.

344
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,691
Yes, but in fact, she has another castle.

345
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,318
Does she not?

346
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:57,654
Mother...

347
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:01,741
One in the Moors,
and one left behind by her father.

348
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,911
King Stefan, was it not?

349
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,790
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

350
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,585
So, you're also a true princess.

351
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,838
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

352
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,798
Remind me, did he die or was he killed?

353
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,926
Both.

354
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,888
Yes, you're right, it is very warm recently.

355
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:27,892
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

356
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,104
A baby cursed to sleep...

357
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,356
and never wake up.

358
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,942
Really?

359
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,696
Who would do such a terrible thing
to an innocent child?

360
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:46,036
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

361
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,288
I'm sure your kind would agree.

362
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,123
What do you mean, my kind?

363
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,751
She means humans.

364
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,753
There are fairies missing from the Moors.

365
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,463
What I'm missing is some wine.

366
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,340
Stolen by human poachers.

367
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,799
That's the first I've heard of it.

368
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,301
Someone gave the order.

369
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,353
It sounds as if you're accusing the king.

370
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:13,897
No, she never said that.

371
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,483
Wait...
Sorry, who would steal a fairy?

372
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,027
Your Majesty, I must report
that two peasants were found dead...

373
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,987
just outside the Moors.

374
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,822
They'd been missing for several days.

375
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:23,990
I see.

376
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,992
Yes, we all see.

377
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:30,497
The borders are open, but humans
are not welcome. Isn't that right?

378
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,917
What exactly are you implying, Your Majesty?

379
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,212
Innocent men are being slaughtered
on the Moors...

380
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,381
and she's talking about fairies.

381
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,720
Contain your animal.

382
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,681
Or I will.

383
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,938
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were making a threat.

384
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,147
Well, do you?

385
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,148
Do I what?

386
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,274
Know better?

387
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,442
Enough.

388
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:00,860
Put her down.

389
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,280
Please, put her down.

390
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,411
We're here to celebrate.

391
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,499
Forgive me, he's right.

392
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,626
Let's not forget why we're here.

393
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,713
The start of a new life for Aurora.

394
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:23,216
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

395
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:31,016
You have done an admirable job, Maleficent...

396
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:35,228
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

397
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,689
But now...

398
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:41,276
Aurora will finally get...

399
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,778
the love of a real family.

400
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:45,989
A real mother.

401
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,451
Because the one thing I regret...

402
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,287
is never having a daughter of my own.

403
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:55,290
But tonight changes that.

404
00:31:55,457 --> 00:32:00,879
Tonight, I consider Aurora my own.

405
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,311
Guards!

406
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,521
We have opened our home to a witch!

407
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,158
Stop!

408
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:32,619
There is no union.

409
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,245
There will be no wedding.

410
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:37,082
-Maleficent!
-We must protect the king!

411
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,875
Maleficent, please, stop now.

412
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,378
John, I'm so frightened.

413
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,006
What has she done to me?

414
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,467
Father!

415
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,470
John!

416
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,430
We go home.

417
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,266
John!

418
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,477
It's a curse.

419
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,356
It's a curse!

420
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,733
Maleficent has cursed the king!

421
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,612
What have you done?

422
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,572
I've done nothing.

423
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,867
Aurora, we go home now.

424
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:15,954
Aurora!

425
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:30,885
Aurora!

426
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,595
Wake him!

427
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,641
Wake him, please.

428
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,393
Stand aside!

429
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:04,938
To the bedroom!

430
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,317
This magic, we have no tools to reverse it.

431
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,030
There must be a lesion.

432
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,448
Proof of her witchery.

433
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,784
Please, leave His Majesty his dignity.

434
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,912
We all saw what Maleficent did to him.

435
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,248
I'm so sorry.

436
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,835
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

437
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,964
All he wanted was peace.

438
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:32,966
This is all my fault.

439
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,885
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.

440
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:40,432
Maleficent is a threat to everyone.

441
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,684
Especially you.

442
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,146
We'll do our best to protect you.

443
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,399
There must be a way to reverse this.

444
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,570
Mother, could you try kissing him?

445
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,657
True love and all that.

446
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,705
I doubt that would work.

447
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,123
It could save him.

448
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,917
-A kiss is just a kiss.
-Please, Mother.

449
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,711
Very well.

450
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,349
You wanted peace...

451
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,852
now rest in peace forever.

452
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,696
I told you.

453
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,824
This is no fairy tale.

454
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,535
I have to return to the Moors.

455
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:43,745
It's the only way.

456
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,121
Wait, wait. Come here.

457
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:46,748
I have to find her.

458
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:47,916
It's the middle of the night.

459
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,751
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

460
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,544
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

461
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,130
No. You should stay with your family.

462
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,632
You are my family.

463
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,636
Let her go, Philip.

464
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,097
Maybe she can save him.

465
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,696
Maleficent!

466
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:04,993
Maleficent!

467
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,210
Godmother!

468
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,386
Please come back.

469
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,641
She's not in the Moors.

470
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,102
Diaval.

471
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,272
No one's seen her.

472
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,107
I'm so happy to see you.

473
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,277
She's nowhere to be found.

474
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,489
What if she never comes back?

475
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,824
I could be stuck as a human forever.

476
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,618
I have to find her.

477
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:52,457
She's the only one who can break the curse.

478
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:53,893
Tell me she's dead.

479
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,230
The iron pierced her flesh.

480
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,983
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

481
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,237
Then where is her head?

482
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,698
There was something else.

483
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,908
Another creature.

484
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,203
It pulled her from the depths of the sea.

485
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,414
What did it look like?

486
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,999
Her.

487
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,794
It carried her up into the sky.

488
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:23,673
A wounded animal lashes out
and now she's not alone.

489
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,468
We must be ready for war.

490
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,264
Maleficent has cursed the king!

491
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,022
Stay inside!

492
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:47,906
Maleficent has cursed the king!

493
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:24,753
If Conall hadn't found her,
she would be dead.

494
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:30,425
They tried to kill her with this.

495
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:49,194
Do you hear it?

496
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:51,571
Do you hear it?

497
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,035
It's a message from the humans.

498
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:00,330
I hear it loud and clear.

499
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:03,291
Time for us to die.

500
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:08,004
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

501
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:10,548
And we are almost extinct because of it.

502
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:14,427
Killing peasants on the Moors
will only lead to more conflict, Borra.

503
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:16,596
They've pulled the iron from the earth...

504
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:19,432
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

505
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,934
But this...

506
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:25,355
This will finish us.

507
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,065
Our people are safe here for now.

508
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:28,983
But for how long?

509
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,027
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

510
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,822
I call for war.

511
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:36,991
I call for war!

512
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:38,201
Right now!

513
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,538
There are too many humans.

514
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,125
Too many kingdoms.

515
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:49,212
Conall, they will keep finding
new ways to destroy us.

516
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,964
We can't win.

517
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,303
We can't win!

518
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,016
Not this way.

519
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,561
No. You're wrong, Conall.

520
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,857
We have something they didn't plan on.

521
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,111
We have her.

522
00:44:18,324 --> 00:44:20,118
She holds powers none of us possess.

523
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:23,830
She is wounded, Borra.

524
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:26,583
Who are you?

525
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,352
You reek of human.

526
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,897
Maybe I was wrong about you.

527
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:52,901
Or maybe Conall should have left you
for dead at the bottom of the sea.

528
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:58,073
No.

529
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,618
It's there, isn't it?

530
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,454
It's inside you.

531
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:24,599
You see?

532
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:31,022
You see what's inside her?

533
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,484
That is what will save us all.

534
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,129
You saved me.

535
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:59,050
Come.

536
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:06,099
Let me show you who we are.

537
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:03,239
We're Dark Fey.

538
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:06,326
Same as you.

539
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,297
We're all that remain.

540
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,635
Unseen here, far away from mankind.

541
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,053
Look!

542
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:29,182
As more human kingdoms emerged,
we went into hiding...

543
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:31,976
from every corner of the earth...

544
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:35,146
doing what we had to, to survive.

545
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:38,233
But many were lost.

546
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:03,174
Only a few generations ago...

547
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:05,593
our kind roamed every part of the world.

548
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,263
The tundra.

549
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,723
The forest.

550
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,266
The jungle.

551
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:17,230
The desert.

552
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,488
Now, our only refuge is here...

553
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:27,240
in this cave.

554
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,451
Our nest of origin.

555
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:36,416
Listen. Play in the wind.

556
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:39,169
Go!

557
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:02,692
Those children should be soaring
over the trees and rivers.

558
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:04,778
Instead, they are raised in exile.

559
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:06,863
I could protect them.

560
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:11,284
How? By waging war against the humans?

561
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,370
I've been at war with them my whole life.

562
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,579
Not all of them.

563
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:17,874
There was one you raised as your own.

564
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:23,213
Maybe we don't have to hide from the humans.

565
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,298
Maybe we can exist without fear...

566
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,258
and war.

567
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:30,095
Find a way together.

568
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:33,598
That will never happen.

569
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:06,733
Gotcha!

570
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:14,908
Welcome to your new home.

571
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,346
We've been worried about you, dear.

572
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,390
Your Majesty.

573
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,226
I couldn't find her.

574
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:44,020
My heart breaks for you.

575
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:48,483
She has brought a cloud of darkness
upon your happiness.

576
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:52,028
I know she was against this marriage.

577
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:55,490
Never trusted your instincts as a queen.

578
00:51:56,032 --> 00:51:58,576
When I saw her at dinner...

579
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:02,664
with her horns covered...

580
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,793
bent cowering...

581
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:15,176
Well, it's no wonder that she lashed out.

582
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:17,721
I just don't know what to do.

583
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:21,057
You do truly love him, don't you?

584
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:22,642
My son.

585
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:24,144
Deeply.

586
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:28,064
It is love that will heal you.

587
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:30,483
It's what heals us all.

588
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:34,529
Let's move forward together...

589
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:37,073
as a family.

590
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:56,384
To all who live on the Moors...

591
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,472
What is that noise?

592
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:03,600
...and kingdoms far and wide,
the king and queen invite you...

593
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,810
to attend the wedding...

594
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:09,314
of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.

595
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,858
All are welcome.

596
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:17,447
And all are expected!

597
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,201
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

598
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:23,453
I knew Aurora wouldn't abandon us!

599
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,705
I always knew I'd be invited.

600
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:27,999
Just glad you two made the cut.

601
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,585
Who's getting married?

602
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:42,639
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

603
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:45,809
The queen is right.

604
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:48,311
We owe it to everyone...

605
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,980
especially the king.

606
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:53,817
What about Maleficent?

607
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:59,072
She's gone.

608
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:13,253
The Phoenix.

609
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,755
It is said the Dark Fey began with her...

610
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,175
evolved over centuries.

611
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,263
You are the last of her descendants.

612
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:26,433
Her blood is your own.

613
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,853
You are her.

614
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:36,568
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

615
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:39,529
destruction and rebirth.

616
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:46,536
But nature's greatest power
is the power of true transformation.

617
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:51,583
You transformed when you raised Aurora.

618
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,670
When you found love...

619
00:54:55,837 --> 00:54:58,923
in the middle of your pain.

620
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:03,261
I'm asking you to take all of your fury...

621
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,722
all of your pain...

622
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:08,725
and not use it.

623
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:12,187
Help us broker peace with the humans.

624
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,106
Because peace...

625
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,445
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

626
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:31,081
The Moors are our last true nature on earth.

627
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:35,543
And yet you named a human as queen.

628
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:38,838
A daughter you cared for.

629
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:43,093
I have no daughter.

630
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:48,098
She has chosen her side.

631
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:02,153
We've just heard.

632
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:05,407
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

633
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:09,202
Humans will come from all over.

634
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:11,579
That's when we attack.

635
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:14,499
We'll kill the king and queen of Ulstead...

636
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,668
and their young prince.

637
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,548
Their kingdom will fall.

638
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:24,718
And the Fey will rise again.

639
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:43,194
The fairies made it.

640
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:01,755
I wore it when I married the king.

641
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:11,348
I'm sure it's perfect.

642
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,308
So am I.

643
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,566
Your Majesty, she's absolutely lovely.

644
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:23,693
Considering how she was raised.

645
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,237
By the same evil witch who cursed her.

646
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,532
It's a miracle Prince Philip came along.

647
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:32,660
It's a miracle
the poor child is alive at all.

648
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:35,872
Thank you so much.

649
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,040
It's exquisite.

650
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,197
When I'm older...

651
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,157
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

652
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,661
Then we can look after each other.

653
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:37,892
-Tell me what's troubling you.
-It's nothing.

654
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:41,646
Aurora, I know you better than that.

655
00:58:44,482 --> 00:58:45,692
This jewelry...

656
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:47,944
my hair...

657
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:50,196
all these rules.

658
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:52,866
I can't breathe.

659
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,536
I feel like
I'm not Queen of the Moors anymore.

660
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:58,913
I feel like a different person.

661
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:00,498
Listen...

662
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:04,502
I fell in love with a girl in the forest
and only her.

663
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:06,171
You don't have to change.

664
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,465
I don't want you to change.

665
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,768
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

666
00:59:38,995 --> 00:59:40,288
Ah, yes.

667
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:43,416
Well...

668
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:46,378
Does it work?

669
00:59:46,544 --> 00:59:49,339
I only have a handful of fairy specimens
to work with...

670
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:51,966
and the extraction process is painstaking.

671
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:54,678
Extraction from what?

672
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,806
Tomb Bloom flowers.

673
00:59:57,972 --> 01:00:00,809
They grow from a fairy's grave,
contain their very essence.

674
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:02,811
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

675
01:00:02,977 --> 01:00:05,772
the resulting dust ends a fairy's life.

676
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,565
We will need thousands more.

677
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:10,735
Show me.

678
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:13,822
Show me.

679
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:15,281
Very well.

680
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:19,411
So...

681
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:13,465
Finally, the Moors will be mine.

682
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,968
No more fairies.

683
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:52,462
Stay alert, men.

684
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:12,315
This is where I found them.

685
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,483
Excellent.

686
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:15,694
But what if the winged one returns?

687
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,779
Don't you worry about that.

688
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:19,698
We'll be ready.

689
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:21,032
Take the Tomb Blooms.

690
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,702
Get to work!

691
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:40,468
Sentries, stay alert!

692
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:41,886
Keep your weapons on hand.

693
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:03,867
Move it!

694
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,293
Maleficent...

695
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:59,214
This is where we bury our dead.

696
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:02,384
They've destroyed it.

697
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:09,015
This is what the humans do.

698
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,768
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

699
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,603
We have to stop them.

700
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:19,359
You spent years caring for a human...

701
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:22,529
now it's time to care for your own.

702
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,123
Fire!

703
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,603
Reload! We go again!

704
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:02,861
Fire!

705
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,950
Reload! There's another one!

706
01:06:25,985 --> 01:06:27,779
Everyone, stay together!

707
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:29,614
We're about to leave the Moors.

708
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,241
Grab the hand or the wing...

709
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:33,785
or the tail of whoever is closest to you.

710
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:18,329
Hey, over here! Yeah, over here!

711
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:20,874
Hold formation, guards. Hold formation.

712
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,127
-Excuse me, sir.
-Stop right there.

713
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,337
I'm with the bride.

714
01:07:25,503 --> 01:07:28,590
We've been told to let the other kind
find their seats first.

715
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:29,841
But I'm not a human.

716
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:31,760
-I'm a raven.
-What?

717
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:34,054
A raven. The black bird.

718
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,806
This rice is delicious.

719
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:39,517
You're supposed to throw it
at the bride and groom.

720
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:42,103
What? And waste good rice?

721
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:43,521
What's the hold up?

722
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:45,523
Let me in!

723
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,650
Why can't humans come in, too?

724
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:50,904
Why can't we come in?

725
01:07:58,244 --> 01:07:59,245
I know it's bad luck...

726
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,081
but I had to see you.

727
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:03,917
For you.

728
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,752
A Tomb Bloom?

729
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:06,878
Where did you get this?

730
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,004
From my mother.

731
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:11,383
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

732
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:21,226
From my mother.

733
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:12,105
Where should we sit, Flittle?

734
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,149
On the left.
We're with the bride.

735
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:15,817
Yes, we are.

736
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:17,736
But the groom's lovely, too.

737
01:11:17,902 --> 01:11:19,571
Yes, he is.

738
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:21,865
I'm with both.

739
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:32,917
Now.

740
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,068
What's this?

741
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,903
Nobody is allowed in here except me.

742
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,822
And I'm already here, so go away!

743
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,509
Maleficent, please stop.

744
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:31,267
Maleficent.

745
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:32,852
She didn't do it.

746
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:37,565
Get out!

747
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,443
Before I call the guards!

748
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:48,910
The missing fairies.

749
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:50,328
I said get out. Did you hear me?

750
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:51,871
What have you done?

751
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,170
You're a pixie.

752
01:12:59,337 --> 01:13:00,630
How dare you call me that?

753
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,757
I'm Lickspittle, the nobleman...

754
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,676
and I serve the queen.

755
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:07,637
She took your wings.

756
01:13:11,182 --> 01:13:12,684
We have to release them.

757
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:14,894
They belong on the Moors.

758
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:16,062
As you do, Aurora.

759
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:21,609
A human who has betrayed her kind.

760
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,076
You put the curse on the king.

761
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:31,828
Oh, dear.

762
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,289
You may be queen...

763
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:36,207
but you are very young.

764
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:39,210
Ruling humans is a bit more complicated...

765
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:43,590
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

766
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:48,470
When I was young...

767
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:52,599
my family's kingdom bordered the Moors.

768
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:57,020
And one particularly harsh winter...

769
01:13:57,187 --> 01:13:58,813
our crops died...

770
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,775
and the people began to suffer.

771
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:05,236
And as we looked over our walls...

772
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:08,448
we could see the fairies thriving.

773
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:12,369
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

774
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:17,665
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

775
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:22,462
Choosing peace over our people,
he sent my brother to do his bidding.

776
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,173
He never came back.

777
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,134
Those savages...

778
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:32,305
creatures who could barely grunt,
let alone engage in talks, killed him.

779
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:34,391
I don't believe that.

780
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:35,850
Our people became fearful.

781
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:38,645
They overthrew my father.

782
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:41,773
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

783
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:47,028
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

784
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:51,616
Another weak king
speaking of tolerance and civility.

785
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:54,494
And now, my own son...

786
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:57,872
corrupted with visions of harmony.

787
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,126
But peace will not be our downfall.

788
01:15:06,214 --> 01:15:08,008
Now lock her up.

789
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:11,136
A war is coming.

790
01:15:16,933 --> 01:15:18,893
No! No!

791
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:29,738
I wish you could be here with me.

792
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,457
Conall wanted peace...

793
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:45,420
and they filled him with iron.

794
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,299
Now, we will have our war.

795
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:54,512
Our fight begins now!

796
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,265
We will rise together!

797
01:15:57,932 --> 01:15:59,559
We fight together.

798
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:04,189
And we will show them no mercy!

799
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:23,333
Come on! Go!

800
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,339
Go! Go!

801
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,301
Go! Go! Go!

802
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:48,942
Where are all Philip's guests?

803
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:51,319
Humans are poor timekeepers.

804
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:20,265
Start the music.

805
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,701
Come on! Come on!

806
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:44,808
She's gone.

807
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:47,477
Hey!

808
01:18:57,904 --> 01:19:00,365
It's a trap! Get down!

809
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,510
Your Majesty...

810
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:24,014
they're coming from the sea.

811
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:34,691
She escaped!

812
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:43,408
Down this way, come on!

813
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,417
Your Highness.

814
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,002
Upon my command.

815
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:05,805
Check every room!

816
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,351
She can't be far!

817
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:43,301
Wait.

818
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:45,929
Wait.

819
01:21:09,577 --> 01:21:11,329
What's going on?

820
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,626
Now.

821
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:18,044
Fire!

822
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:28,763
No!

823
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:57,584
They look just like her.

824
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:03,089
Withdraw!

825
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:05,300
Withdraw!

826
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:07,969
Pull back!

827
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:09,512
Maleficent's starting a war.

828
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,848
First my father, and now this.

829
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:14,184
Philip! She didn't curse him.

830
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:15,977
-Maleficent.
-What?

831
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,188
She never cursed him.

832
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:20,940
It was your mother.

833
01:22:21,107 --> 01:22:22,317
What are you saying?

834
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:23,693
It was the spindle.

835
01:22:28,948 --> 01:22:30,492
The curse is still in it.

836
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,495
Your mother used it against your father.

837
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,664
Look.

838
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,043
It's the same.

839
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:43,463
She's locked the Moor folk in the chapel.

840
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,839
This isn't a wedding.

841
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:47,008
It's a trap.

842
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:54,140
Remember where you came from.

843
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:57,102
Remember who you are.

844
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,273
I've made my choice.

845
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,402
You'll have to make yours.

846
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,223
Stay low!

847
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:38,643
Divide!

848
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:42,439
Follow me!

849
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:52,449
Attack!

850
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:55,326
Attack!

851
01:24:06,379 --> 01:24:08,131
-Ignite!
-Ignite!

852
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:19,476
No!

853
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:05,230
Aunties!
Aunties!

854
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,776
It's too heavy!

855
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,320
Aurora!

856
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:13,697
Diaval! You're here.

857
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:19,494
What's happening?

858
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:40,473
Weapon change!

859
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:43,601
Weapon change! Go!

860
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:24,976
Mother!

861
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:27,270
You have to stop this.

862
01:26:27,437 --> 01:26:28,897
We are at war.

863
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:30,940
This isn't a war. It's a massacre.

864
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:32,609
Philip, you don't understand.

865
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:35,445
These creatures stand between us...

866
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:38,198
and everything we need to survive.

867
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:39,616
You're wrong.

868
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:41,159
We can stand together.

869
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:44,037
Well, you're a fool to believe that.

870
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:47,499
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

871
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:49,709
You lied to me.

872
01:26:50,752 --> 01:26:52,712
I am protecting the kingdom...

873
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:55,131
and your throne.

874
01:26:55,548 --> 01:26:56,758
What about Father?

875
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:01,429
Were you protecting him, too?

876
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:06,184
The prince is not feeling well.

877
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,229
See him to his chambers.

878
01:27:13,149 --> 01:27:14,067
Now.

879
01:27:18,571 --> 01:27:19,781
Sire, stop!

880
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:49,019
Yield! Yield!

881
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:50,895
My mother cursed the king
so she could destroy the Moor folk.

882
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,481
Your men are paying heavily for it.

883
01:28:00,363 --> 01:28:02,407
We have to do something!

884
01:28:06,369 --> 01:28:07,787
Goodbye, girls.

885
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:10,915
No, come back!

886
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:13,001
Flittle! No!

887
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:26,890
No!

888
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:28,892
Hey, you, stay with your own!

889
01:28:29,517 --> 01:28:31,061
Run, Aurora, run!

890
01:28:31,227 --> 01:28:32,896
Let him go!

891
01:28:37,525 --> 01:28:39,611
No! No!

892
01:29:06,763 --> 01:29:08,515
Godmother.

893
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:08,533
For Flittle!

894
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:18,251
We've got her!

895
01:31:06,299 --> 01:31:08,009
Go! Go!

896
01:31:08,176 --> 01:31:10,720
This way! This way!

897
01:31:10,887 --> 01:31:11,846
Go!

898
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:56,474
Stand down!

899
01:31:58,268 --> 01:31:59,686
This is not my fight.

900
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:03,023
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

901
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:07,694
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

902
01:32:26,087 --> 01:32:27,881
There will be no Fey blood on my hands.

903
01:32:49,819 --> 01:32:51,780
This way!
This way!

904
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,825
Maleficent's back!

905
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:02,957
She's going for the queen.

906
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:10,548
Yield! Yield!

907
01:33:10,715 --> 01:33:11,716
Stand down!

908
01:33:11,883 --> 01:33:13,218
Lower your weapons!

909
01:33:25,522 --> 01:33:28,316
There's the evil that I promised them.

910
01:33:31,903 --> 01:33:34,531
Your kind is more predictable than humans.

911
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:42,080
Stop!

912
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:43,873
Stop!

913
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,167
Well, almost.

914
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:47,544
Stop.

915
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:50,714
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

916
01:33:51,047 --> 01:33:52,841
There's another way.

917
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:54,217
I know who you are.

918
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:59,097
I know you.

919
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:01,141
You do not.

920
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,770
Yes, I do.

921
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,189
You're my mother.

922
01:34:43,308 --> 01:34:44,601
No!

923
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:02,869
Do you know what
makes a great leader, Aurora?

924
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:07,248
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

925
01:35:07,415 --> 01:35:08,625
and then use that fear...

926
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:09,751
Your Majesty.

927
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:13,546
...against your enemies.

928
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:15,298
So...

929
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:19,678
I spread the story of the evil witch...

930
01:35:19,844 --> 01:35:22,514
and the princess she cursed.

931
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:27,227
It didn't matter who woke Sleeping Beauty.

932
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:30,063
They were all terrified.

933
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,358
And the story became legend.

934
01:35:35,652 --> 01:35:37,737
I know you think I'm a monster.

935
01:35:38,321 --> 01:35:43,284
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

936
01:35:44,077 --> 01:35:47,038
I did for Ulstead.

937
01:35:47,205 --> 01:35:51,668
You are a traitor to your kind,
and you will pay for it.

938
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:54,838
Maleficent is dead!

939
01:35:57,841 --> 01:36:00,051
We will never again live in fear!

940
01:36:01,052 --> 01:36:02,554
Get back here!

941
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:08,685
Ulstead is free at last!

942
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,563
Let me go!

943
01:36:20,155 --> 01:36:21,281
What's happening?

944
01:39:46,945 --> 01:39:48,780
Well, well.

945
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,908
Hello, Beasty.

946
01:40:10,552 --> 01:40:11,594
I missed you.

947
01:40:13,346 --> 01:40:14,848
Did you bump your head, then?

948
01:40:15,348 --> 01:40:16,516
I did.

949
01:40:19,477 --> 01:40:20,812
Philip.

950
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:22,689
Yes?

951
01:40:24,524 --> 01:40:26,359
Do you love my daughter?

952
01:40:29,362 --> 01:40:30,655
With everything I have.

953
01:40:39,914 --> 01:40:41,082
Good.

954
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:52,969
I believe this belongs to you.

955
01:40:59,684 --> 01:41:01,728
Curses don't end.

956
01:41:01,895 --> 01:41:03,605
They're broken.

957
01:41:29,005 --> 01:41:30,757
It ends.

958
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:38,848
There will be no more fighting.

959
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:41,893
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

960
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:43,353
And from this day on...

961
01:41:44,145 --> 01:41:46,356
we move forward...

962
01:41:46,773 --> 01:41:49,109
and find our way...

963
01:41:50,193 --> 01:41:51,611
in peace.

964
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:53,571
Together.

965
01:41:56,908 --> 01:41:59,202
Today, there will be a wedding.

966
01:41:59,661 --> 01:42:02,997
Not just a union of two people...

967
01:42:03,164 --> 01:42:06,167
but a union of two kingdoms.

968
01:42:06,334 --> 01:42:07,836
And all are invited...

969
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,880
all are safe...

970
01:42:11,047 --> 01:42:13,258
and all are welcome.

971
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:49,169
Hello, there.

972
01:43:30,126 --> 01:43:33,171
We cannot live amongst monsters...

973
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:41,805
Someone should really cover those horns.

974
01:43:58,863 --> 01:44:00,615
If only Conall could see you.

975
01:44:02,784 --> 01:44:03,785
Borra...

976
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:08,164
it's time to come home.

977
01:44:14,671 --> 01:44:16,047
Hello.

978
01:44:17,632 --> 01:44:19,592
Can you come here?

979
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,187
Yes?

980
01:44:33,106 --> 01:44:34,899
Will you give me away?

981
01:44:35,275 --> 01:44:36,735
Never.

982
01:44:37,902 --> 01:44:39,237
No.

983
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:41,322
Will you walk me down the aisle?

984
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:46,953
Yes.

985
01:45:10,268 --> 01:45:12,479
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

986
01:45:25,075 --> 01:45:25,867
Is that...?

987
01:45:26,701 --> 01:45:28,495
She can change her back.

988
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:30,455
I suppose.

989
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:33,124
Only if we wanted to.

990
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:36,336
Father.

991
01:45:41,049 --> 01:45:43,218
I'm so glad to see you.

992
01:45:43,385 --> 01:45:45,428
I've dreamed of this moment.

993
01:45:45,595 --> 01:45:47,847
Two kingdoms united at last.

994
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:50,600
And it's because of you.

995
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:53,937
I'm so proud of you. So proud.

996
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:24,551
She looks better in green.

997
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:25,844
Pink, you mean.

998
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:30,306
No, in green.

999
01:46:31,182 --> 01:46:31,891
Pink.

1000
01:46:32,058 --> 01:46:33,351
-Green.
-Pink.

1001
01:46:36,521 --> 01:46:37,897
Flittle!

1002
01:46:38,064 --> 01:46:40,358
It's perfect.

1003
01:47:24,736 --> 01:47:26,529
Let her go.

1004
01:47:40,168 --> 01:47:42,545
Pull yourself together.

1005
01:47:42,921 --> 01:47:46,007
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1006
01:47:46,174 --> 01:47:47,801
divided by fear.

1007
01:47:48,677 --> 01:47:53,723
Today, you teach us
we are not defined by where we are from...

1008
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:56,101
but by whom we love.

1009
01:47:58,144 --> 01:47:59,729
The bands, please.

1010
01:48:15,453 --> 01:48:18,248
-Do you, Philip, take Aurora...
-I do.

1011
01:48:19,874 --> 01:48:22,168
-And do you, Aurora, take...
-I do.

1012
01:48:22,794 --> 01:48:26,464
Then I pronounce you husband and wife.

1013
01:48:26,631 --> 01:48:28,675
You may kiss the bride.

1014
01:48:59,456 --> 01:49:00,498
You're smiling.

1015
01:49:23,438 --> 01:49:25,106
It's a new day.

1016
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:29,319
It is.

1017
01:49:40,914 --> 01:49:41,956
Morning.

1018
01:49:42,832 --> 01:49:44,918
Will you stay awhile?

1019
01:49:45,085 --> 01:49:46,336
A little while.

1020
01:49:46,753 --> 01:49:48,630
But don't worry...

1021
01:49:48,797 --> 01:49:51,299
I'll see you at the christening.
