Fleshy lower lip.

00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:12,541
Prognathous jaw
typical of non-European races.

8
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,710
Narrow forehead.

9
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,577
Low hairline.

10
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:30,046
Hair is thick, oily and shiny.

11
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:35,540
Normal ears.

00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,580

Non-Jewish body language
during examination.

18
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,404
Now walk.

19
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,696
Naturally large and flaccid hips.

20
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,638
On tiptoe now.

21
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,638
Soles of the feet are flat.

22
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:14,894
Arch is totally absent.

23
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:18,704
Get dressed.

24
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:22,336
In the opinion of the undersigned,

25
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:27,210
based on morphological
and behavioral data,

26
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,278
the subject could well belong

27
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:35,039
to the Semitic race.

28
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:40,506
Her ancestry could be either Jewish,

29
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:42,972
Armenian,

30
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,036
or Arab.

31
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:49,800
For now, the case must be
considered doubtful.

32
00:03:58,714 --> 00:03:59,975
You can go.

33
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,775
How much do I owe you?

34
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,370
See my secretary.

35
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:06,208
You’ll be notified
by the prefecture of police.

36
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:21,560
Fifteen francs.

37
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:03,580
How did it go?

38
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:06,036
All right.

39
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,342
- What about you?
- All right.

40
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,580
Did he tell you anything?

41
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,014
And you?

42
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,340
<i>- Mr. Klein?
- Yes, that’s me.</i>

43
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,573
<i>Would you please come in?</i>

44
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,575
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

45
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:42,375
<i>I have something
that might interest you.</i>

46
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:46,244
<i>Did a mutual friend send you?</i>

47
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,839
<i>I don’t believe we’ve met.</i>

48
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:54,772
<i>I was told you might be interested</i>

49
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,473
<i>in purchasing paintings.</i>

50
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,706
<i>Well,yes, I might be.</i>

51
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,973
<i>I have a painting here.</i>

52
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:08,014
<i>It’s a work by Adriaen van Ostade,</i>

53
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,141
<i>a portrait of a gentleman.</i>

54
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:15,010
<i>It’s an authentic painting,
signed and dated.</i>

55
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,519
<i>It appears in the catalog.</i>

56
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,110
<i>Snow</i>

57
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,374

<i>lacy arabesques,</i>

60
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:30,511
<i>webs of icy silk.</i>

61

<i>Fables, dreams,</i>

62
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:34,644
<i>spells, illusions.</i>

63
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,006
<i>And suddenly</i>

64
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,138
<i>the blue glare and the red blaze</i>

65
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,975
<i>of the young Phalangists.</i>

66
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:44,136
<i>The flower,</i>

67
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,340
<i>the pride of France.!</i>

68
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,002
<i>The paladins.!</i>

69
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,076
<i>On the horizon,
the pinnacles of Leningrad</i>

70
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:54,340
<i>appear and disappear</i>

71
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,403
<i>like a mirage.</i>

72
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,321
<i>Six hundred louis.</i>

73
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,774
<i>Three hundred.</i>

74
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,776
<i>You must be joking</i>

75
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,012
<i>At that price, I’d rather keep it.</i>

76
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,113
<i>As you wish.</i>

77
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>It’s easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell.</i>

78
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,704
<i>But I’m not forced to buy.</i>

79
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,029
<i>I’m not a collector.</i>

80

<i>For me</i>

81
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:27,574
<i>it’s just a job.</i>

82
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,306
<i>Make me a reasonable offer.</i>

83
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:34,006
<i>Three hundred.</i>

84
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,873
Robert!

85
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,208
Go back to bed.

86
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,941
- Why?
- "Why?"

87
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,947
Why do you think?

88
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:01,337
- Wait a minute.
- Later. Go back to bed.

89
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,973
If it were a matter of francs,

90
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:41,706
instead of gold louis...

91
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,370
It’s true that francs
are worthless abroad,

92
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,708
but if you need money in France --

93
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,202
I don’t need it in France.

94
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,436
Very well.

95
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:56,842
Let’s make out a receipt.

96
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:00,836
It’s just a formality.
It’s for me.

97
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:03,536
It’ll stay in my safe.

98
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,806
Here. Write it yourself.

99
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:13,504
Unless you have a receipt
from whoever sold it to you.

100
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,342
We’ve always had it in our house.

101
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:22,236
Always.

102
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,279
Well, perhaps my grandfather,

103
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,136
when he came from Holland.

104
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,007
Or perhaps his father.

105
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,206
Yes.

106
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:35,029
It’s a long time ago.
It doesn’t matter.

107
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:37,506
It’s just a formality.

108
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,376
Now would you write

109
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,706
"I, the undersigned" --

110
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,604
Name, surname and address.

111
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:51,383
No, never mind the address.

112
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:53,877
Name, surname.

113
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,372
"Declare that I hereby make over

114
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,675

the agreed amount acceptable to me --

And your signature.

124
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,603
Have you got something to put it in?

125
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,203
No, but it doesn’t matter.

126
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,579
Don’t you want to count it?

127
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:34,635
Wait. I’ll give you a present.

128
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,011
No, thank you.
Don’t bother.

129
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,338
May I take one?

130
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,740
I have friends in the same situation,

131
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:53,109
and perhaps they...

132
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:54,908
Yes, of course.

133
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,139
Although I’d rather--

134
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,544
That is, recently,
I’ve seen many clients like you,

135
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:01,739
urgently needing to sell.

136
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:05,307
And I assure you
it’s most unpleasant for me.

137
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,869
Embarrassing

138
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,547
Very often I’d rather not buy.

139
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,311
Then don’t.

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,074

I mean, I have no reason to be.

184

Isn’t your paper sent
only to subscribers?

185
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:14,444
It’s our only way to keep
the community informed

about meetings, decisions

by the authorities, and so on.

188
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,435
I understand,

189
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,574
but I don’t belong to your--

190
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,209
Yes, I understand.

191
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,506
It’s strange.

192
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,544
Unless someone else --

193
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,841
perhaps a friend of yours --

194
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:36,573
subscribed for you.

195
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,174
That’s impossible.

196
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:42,508
No one would play
that sort of joke on me.

197
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:49,439
You think we make
a good subject for jokes?

198
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,973
No, I didn’t mean that.

199
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,808
But the very idea seems so absurd.

200
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,869
Please excuse me.

201
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,642
So you no longer wish
to receive our newspaper?

202
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:06,043
Exactly

203
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,438
I would also like to know
why you sent it to me.

204
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,742
I understand. Unfortunately,

205
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:19,505
we must wait until the prefecture
returns our list of subscribers.

206
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,240
Then we can check.

207
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:24,973
- The prefecture?
- Yes, the prefecture of police.

208
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,821
You give your lists to the police?

209
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,472
They’re the ones who’ve allowed us
and advised us to publish this newspaper.

210
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,274
As I told you,
it’s the only way we have --

211
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,503
Yes, I understand.

212
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:43,445
Where is the prefecture?

213
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,945
The Commission for Jewish Affairs.

214
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,060
Robert Klein, did you say?

215
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,841
Yes.

216
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,340
Like that?

217
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,944
Address?

218
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,135
136 Rue du Bac.

219
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,045
How long have you lived there?

220
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,340
About seven years,
since I came to Paris.

221
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,704
Yes, in fact,
there is a Robert Klein.

222
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,010
But at another address.

223
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,976
Obviously a man with the same name.

224
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,535
May I have his address?

225
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:49,643
What would you say if I gave yours
to anyone who asked for it?

226
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,769
Take it away.

227
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:05,258
Where did you say you lived?

228
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,336
136 Rue du Bac.

229
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,133
The fact remains, someone
wrote my name on the paper. Why?

230
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:18,343
You understand my concern?

231
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:21,243
Perfectly.

232
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:25,973
It’s more curiosity than anxiety.
The fact someone would --

233
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:33,243
I’m sorry.
I’m taking up your time.

234
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:36,408
Such things can’t interest the police.

235
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,140
Luckily for me.

236
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:01,107
What does "Moby Dick" mean?
Is it a name?

237
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,507
Yes.

238
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,269
A woman’s name?

239
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:08,510
No, a whale’s.

240
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,412
He’s exactly like me.

241
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,140
Who’s that?

242
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:24,702
Ishmael.

243
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,206
Listen to this.

244
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,513
"Sixteen hours in bed.

245
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,739
The small of my back ached.

246
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,835
I felt worse and worse.

247
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:37,675
At last, I got up

248
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:40,696
and threw myself at her feet,

249
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:43,172
beseeching her to beat me,

250
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:45,042
to do anything, indeed,

251
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:48,738
but condemn me to lie in bed

252
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:51,845
for such an unendurable
length of time."

253
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,340
Can I get up?

254
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,436
Do me a favor:
Get a different book.

255
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,535
The one with the pink cover.

256
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,511
"Chloé."

257
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,769
From the beginning?

258
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,608
Wherever you’d like.

259
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:44,345
Page 47.

260
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,727
"Pale and trembling like doves,

261
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,592
the three maidens entered the room.

262
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,245
In the dancing firelight,

263
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:52,779
it looked even more
imposing and fantastic" --

264
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:56,035
It can’t be.

265
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,268
Go on.

266
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,135
I can’t.

267
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,869
Go on.

268
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:07,244
"Imposing and fantastic.

269
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,844
That enormous penis,

270
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:13,745
tumescent,

271
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,540
superb,

272
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:16,772
alive."

273
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:39,972
Go on.

274
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,936
<i>I know very little about him.</i>

275
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:00,343
<i>I never saw much of him</i>

276
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,504
The girl took care of everything.

277
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,478
A brunette,

278
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,206
pretty sexy.

279
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,609
I think she was a whore

280
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,339
or a dancer.

281
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:14,894
He only went out at night
when I was in bed.

282
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,940
Around midnight,
after curfew,

283
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:19,741
I’d hear him come down the stairs.

284
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,560
And the morning I saw him,

285
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:26,977
it was about 5:00.
I was taking out the trash.

286
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,540
There he is!

287
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:35,941
You’re Mr. Klein, aren’t you,
from the second floor?

288
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,940
No, I’m sorry.

289
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,340
I’m not your Mr. Klein.

290
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,335
Pardon me.

291
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:46,013
I thought you were him.

292
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:50,277
Same height, same hair,just as slim.

293
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,141
The same look.

294
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:55,145
Because I never saw
the other one’s face.

295
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:59,154
What do you want?

296
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,808
I’ve come about the apartment.
Is it still available?

297
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,043
- If you don’t mind waiting a minute.
- Not at all.

298
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,138
We’re finished.
What about the calling card?

299
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:11,201
Yes, it’s right here.

300
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,007
Wait, I’ll write down
the address for his mail.

301
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,173
- Does he still get mail?
- Yes, but not much.

302
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:20,905
A newspaper, a letter.

303
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,468
Nothing else.

304
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,135
So you want to move in here?

305
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,610
No, it’s for a friend
who’s coming to Paris.

306
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:33,942
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

307
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:37,372
If you hear anything, call us.

308
00:25:37,446 --> 00:25:39,173
Yes, certainly.

309
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:47,105
Good-bye.

310
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:52,104
Do you really want
to see the apartment?

311
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,977
The wallpaper needs changing.
It’s all moldy.

312
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:10,602
The ceiling needs painting.

313
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,909
The toilet bowl’s got to be changed.

314
00:26:16,346 --> 00:26:19,005
And you’d have to get rid of the rats.

315
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:21,645
- Rats?
- Yes, rats.

316
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:24,202
Look at this.

317
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,258
All over the place.

318
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:39,274
No, this is no place for you.

319
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:42,040
If you’re interested,

320
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:43,773
it’s 150 francs a month.

321
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,144
Outrageous.

322
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,607
Plus electricity
and a maintenance fee.

323
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:12,972
He had a dog?

324
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,842
Yes, a German shepherd.

325
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,576
Sometimes he’d bark
and then whimper

326
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,542
as if he were being beaten.

327
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:52,269
My husband always said you could
judge a house by the bathroom,

328
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:54,005
and he was right.

329
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:58,308
Well? Haven’t you seen enough?

330
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,542
- The shower?
- It’s out of order.

331
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,868
What’s wrong?

332
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,739
I’m sorry,

333
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:31,710
but since my husband
has been gone,

334
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:32,768
I get funny.

335
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,870
Every now and then,

336
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:39,811
I have these hallucinations.

337
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,940
Is your husband dead?

338
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,739
No, he’s in Germany.

339
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,472
Prisoner of war.

340
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:03,972
Yes, I remember.

341
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,670
A pretty girl and a beautiful dog.

342
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:17,344
You, on the other hand,

343
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:19,072
your face was hidden.

344
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:21,772
But you’re recognizable.

345
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:25,008
Do you still have that sidecar?

346
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,801
No, it got blown up.

347
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,602
May I?

348
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,268
Good evening.

349
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,570
Who’s that skeleton in your house?

350
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,078
What skeleton?

351
00:30:58,146 --> 00:30:59,077
That whore!

352
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:02,105
What do you mean?

353
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:04,869
A girl called Janine.

354
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:11,175
A friend.

355
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,211
Why did I find her here?

356
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,970
Because you got here after her.

357
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:32,902
She was alone in the house.

358
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:36,227
Because she got here first.

359
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:38,872
Is your husband here?

360
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,575
Yes.

361
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:48,569
And two policemen
are waiting for you.

362
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:14,308
Good evening.

363
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:18,201
Sorry I’m late.

364
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,145
Listen.

365
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:26,605
They’re waiting for you.

366
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,168
Yes, your wife told me.

367
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,371
- What’s going on?
- Nothing. I’ll explain later.

368
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,768
Good evening.

369
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,905
I have the impression
we’ve met before.

370
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:45,639
We have that same impression.

371
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:48,870
Did you rent that apartment
for your friend after all?

372
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:51,773
No, I haven’t made up my mind yet.

373
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,241
We brought back your card.

374
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:56,972
Thank you very much.

375
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,544
I have a terrible habit
of handing them out everywhere.

376
00:33:02,212 --> 00:33:04,270
- How about a drink?
- No, thank you.

377
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:06,208
But you go ahead.
We can wait.

378
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:09,408
Are we going somewhere?

379
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,968
The Pigalle police station.

380
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,638
Again?
I went there after I saw you.

381
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:16,144
I spoke to the inspector
just five minutes ago.

382
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,336
Pierre, please turn down
the phonograph.

383
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:24,238
Nicole, would you get me a beer?

384
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:32,544
Maybe you should call him.
That would save time.

385
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:40,068
Pigalle 30-30?

386
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:45,272
- Call him, François.
- May I?

387
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:46,834
Go right ahead.

388
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:01,405
You bastard.

389
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:03,446
Inspector, we’re here with Mr. Klein.

390
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,610
Yes, sir. Very well.

391
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,002
Who could this other Klein be?

392
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:19,567
I have no idea.

393
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,446
I first heard about him
yesterday at the prefecture.

394
00:34:23,513 --> 00:34:25,445
Our orders came from the prefecture.

395
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:30,741
Anyway, if you hear anything --

396
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,545
Don’t worry.
It’s in my interest.

397
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:04,134
I don’t like this business.

398
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:08,410
So there’s a man
who’s got the same name, a Jew.

399
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:11,883
He’s gone off and left you
with his problem.

400
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:12,738
How could he know about me?

401
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,473
Your calling cards are all over Paris.

402
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,034
It doesn’t make any sense.

403
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:20,101
Does he expect me
to just shut up and take his place?

404
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,371
It’s someone with a grudge
against me

405
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,910
trying to get me into trouble,
provoke me.

406
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:29,227
Why should he have
a grudge against you?

407
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:31,425
And why not?

408
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:21,210
"My love,

409
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:24,592
what interminable months!

410
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,608
In two days,
it’ll be our January 26th.

411
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,702
I’m here, waiting for you.

412
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:32,402
The train to Ivry la Bataille
still leaves at 6:15.

413
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,468
You mustn’t miss it, you know that?

414
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,409
Because this time, I swear

415
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,535
you’d lose me.

416
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:41,805
And that would be awful,
my darling.

417
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,438
Florence."

418
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,738
"You mustn’t miss it, you know that?

419
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,277
Because this time
it would be awful, my darling.

420
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,339
Florence."

421
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,704
Do you have any baggage?

422
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:26,019
Please follow me, sir.

423
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:39,141
Good evening, Mr. Klein.

424
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:40,905
Please come in.

425
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,405
They’re expecting you.

426
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,768
May I take your coat?

427
00:41:50,379 --> 00:41:51,708
Please.

428
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,334
Good evening.

429
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:04,744
I’m Charles-Xavier,

430
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,200
your host.

431
00:43:17,245 --> 00:43:19,836
I know, it’s a complicated story.

432
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,243
Come with me.

433
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:25,875
It’s quieter in there.

434
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:28,071
Yes, then I can explain.

435
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:11,409
Florence, can you imagine Robert
living in Pigalle?

436
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,138
In a furnished room?

437
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:15,440
Robert in Pigalle?

438
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:17,974
In lodgings, Rue des Abbesses.

439
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:21,170
That’s impossible.
It’s absurd.

440
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,108
This gentleman has the same name.

441
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:24,941
Really? Just like Robert?

442
00:44:25,013 --> 00:44:26,671
Isn’t that funny.

443
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:27,904
Please.

444
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:32,174
What was Robert doing in Pigalle?

445
00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:33,710
Nothing.

446
00:44:33,778 --> 00:44:35,642
I don’t think he was ever there.

447
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,939
Then God only knows
why this letter was sent to him in Pigalle.

448
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,842
That’s right.

449
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,572
There’s a letter.

450
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,134
They’re waiting for us.

451
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:47,336
Couldn’t we read it after dinner?

452
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:48,900
It’s only a few lines.

453
00:44:50,345 --> 00:44:52,503
We’re all starving.

454
00:44:52,578 --> 00:44:54,374
Yes, I see your point.

455
00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:58,075
But if you knew Robert
as well as I do --

456
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:01,371
I can’t accept your theory.

457
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:04,468
We can’t be talking
about the same person.

458
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:06,977
Let’s go in to dinner.
Will you stay?

459
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:09,307
No, thank you.
I must return to Paris.

460
00:45:09,378 --> 00:45:11,038
My train leaves soon.

461
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:13,374
I don’t believe there are
any more trains tonight.

462
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,738
No, only on odd days.

463
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:18,592
You see?
Now you have no excuse.

464
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:20,403
There must be a hotel nearby.

465
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:21,910
Requisitioned.

466
00:45:22,578 --> 00:45:24,010
Don’t worry. You’re my guest.

467
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:26,169
Anyhow,

468
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:30,445
we did invite you
in a way, didn’t we?

469
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:32,444
Come on.
Now you have no more excuses.

470
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:06,503
No, don’t move.

471
00:46:06,578 --> 00:46:08,613
Don’t turn on the light.

472
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:17,006
Don’t turn on the light.

473
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,600
My letter.

474
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:23,769
Would you mind giving it back to me?

475
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,768
Would you mind turning around?

476
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:29,208
Why?

477
00:46:31,045 --> 00:46:32,739
Because I sleep in the nude.

478
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:59,404
Tell me.

479
00:47:01,511 --> 00:47:04,000
Does your friend happen to be Jewish?

480
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:05,976
Robert? I don’t think so.

481
00:47:06,913 --> 00:47:10,140
As far as I know, he’s an atheist.

482
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:13,400
Yet he subscribes
to a Jewish newspaper.

483
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:17,154
That’s possible.
He reads a lot.

484
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,533
And talks very little.

485
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:20,941
Who told you that?
On the contrary.

486
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:23,668
Then what did he tell you about me?

487
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:26,241
Nothing.

488
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,743
He never mentioned you.

489
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,608
No letter, then.

490
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:41,217
I know what Robert would say
if he were here.

491
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,070
First, he’d compare you
to an animal or an insect.

492
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,675
His theory is based on
what he calls

493
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:53,108
the infinite variety
of specialized instincts.

494
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:55,701
- How fascinating!
- Isn’t it?

495
00:47:55,778 --> 00:47:59,040
He claims that
in animals and insects,

496
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,340
this variety manifests

497
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,400
in a series of different species.

498
00:48:03,478 --> 00:48:05,706
But in man this is not possible,

499
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:08,244
since there’s only one human species.

500
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:10,435
- Therefore --
- I get the point.

501
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:21,773
The eyes are important,

502
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:23,276
the mouth,

503
00:48:23,345 --> 00:48:25,004
the curve of the lips.

504
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:28,677
A feeling of being superior to others,

505
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:30,608
a love of freedom,

506
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:32,542
egoism.

507
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:34,008
A bird.

508
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,399
Of prey.

509
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:36,842
A falcon.

510
00:48:36,912 --> 00:48:39,105
- A vulture.
- Why?

511
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:41,831
Do I eat corpses?

512
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:46,806
You don’t return letters.

513
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:51,939
How about your friend?

514
00:48:54,345 --> 00:48:56,207
What animal
did he choose for himself?

515
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:59,178
The eagle? The lion?

516
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,633
The snake.

517
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:05,439
A hibernating snake,
waiting for a better season.

518
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,635
I can’t understand
why he got you into this mess.

519
00:49:12,845 --> 00:49:14,641
So he could hide, I think.

520
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:18,374
To disappear behind another man.

521
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:20,367
Me.

522
00:49:20,445 --> 00:49:22,467
No, he’s no coward.

523
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:24,670
He wouldn’t harm anyone.

524
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:26,574
Fxcept himself, perhaps.

525
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:30,203
Or else for revenge.
Yes, then he might.

526
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:32,301
But revenge for what?

527
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,435
I don’t even know him.

528
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:38,078
You know what I thought
when I saw you come in?

529
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,654
That Robert himself had sent you.

530
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:45,599
Why?

531
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:48,940
To explain to me
why he hadn’t come,

532
00:49:49,011 --> 00:49:51,842
to see how I’d react,
to provoke me,

533
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,409
to humiliate me.

534
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:55,808
I don’t understand.

535
00:49:55,878 --> 00:49:57,867
Yes, as if to tell me,

536
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:02,206
"I’m sending another man in my place,
but it will be all the same to you."

537
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:06,204
Yes, he’s capable of that.

538
00:50:07,444 --> 00:50:10,468
That seems a little excessive,
don’t you think?

539
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:13,446
He’s quite capable of that.

540
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,207
What if it were true?

541
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,800
Suppose that’s why I came.

542
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:27,008
He loves that sort of situation.

543
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:30,042
So do I.

544
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,415
What about you?

545
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:33,934
Fven if it’s really untrue?

546
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:35,500
Especially

547
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:39,870
Or let’s suppose --

548
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:45,106
It’s very late. I must go.

549
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:49,073
My husband must be looking for me.

550
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:45,936
We forgot to say good night.

551
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:51,244
I can’t sleep when that happens.

552
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,975
I see you have the same problem.

553
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,967
Do you realize
I could go to the police?

554
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:20,033
Then you must talk.

555
00:53:21,077 --> 00:53:22,771
Where is he?

556
00:53:23,478 --> 00:53:26,035
I swear I don’t know.

557
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:29,469
Let’s start at the beginning.

558
00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:32,436
Where did he live before Pigalle?

559
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:36,267
In a hotel on the Rue de l’Université.

560
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:40,105
When did you learn about Pigalle?

561
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,606
Two months ago.

562
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:45,956
Through a messenger boy

563
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,839
who brought me
his flute and a note.

564
00:53:50,511 --> 00:53:52,534
What did the note say?

565
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:54,832
Nothing.

566
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,910
Jokes, as usual.

567
00:53:58,578 --> 00:54:00,601
He said he was going
into hibernation,

568
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:04,609
and I was to keep his flute
until a better season.

569
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,736
Where did he go into hibernation?

570
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:11,973
I don’t know.

571
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:14,529
He didn’t say.

572
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:16,072
Very well.

573
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:18,941
The police will find out.

574
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:23,469
And you, your husband
and every member of your musical zoo

575
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:25,804
will be called in for questioning.

576
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:30,708
Please don’t do that.

577
00:54:33,175 --> 00:54:34,240
I’m sorry, Florence.

578
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:37,039
But one way or another,
I must find out

579
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:39,044
what this man wants from me.

580
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,907
Good-bye.

581
00:54:49,145 --> 00:54:51,542
It’s a shame about last night.

582
00:54:53,352 --> 00:54:54,871
Just a moment.

583
00:54:56,545 --> 00:54:58,033
All right.

584
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:03,541
But first, you must swear
you won’t go to the police.

585
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,300
I swear.

586
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,534
136 Rue du Bac.

587
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,473
You have the present?

588
00:57:22,545 --> 00:57:24,670
I didn’t sleep all night.

589
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:27,154
Neither did I.
Have you got it?

590
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:29,103
You could have told me.
Some people came looking for you.

591
00:57:29,178 --> 00:57:30,439
What did they want?

592
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:31,999
I don’t know.

593
00:57:59,444 --> 00:58:01,477
Pierre.

594
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:05,592
Is it serious?

595
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:18,243
Tell me, are the Kleins
full-blooded French,

596
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:20,800
or are there Jews in your family?

597
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:28,988
Indifference

598
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:31,934
is like a still, flat sea

599
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:34,170
surrounding a drowning man.

600
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:38,000
It’s like a flock of sheep

601
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:41,669
grazing in the ruins of a village.

602
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,633
Or like a worm

603
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,473
crawling over a putrid wound.

604
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:55,770
A man can be stingy, selfish,
hypocritical, anything --

605
00:58:55,845 --> 00:59:00,539
as long as he’s aware.

606
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:04,138
The result is the same.

607
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:07,076
No, not exactly.

608
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:10,770
- Have you ever heard of remorse?
- Yes.

609
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,400
It’s like a vulture

610
00:59:14,478 --> 00:59:17,435
pierced by an arrow,

611
00:59:16,877 --> 00:59:18,706
yet it continues to fly.

612
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:20,869
Oh, it’s you!

613
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:23,674
What’s the matter?

614
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,733
- Why have you come?
- To see you.

615
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,276
Yes, of course.
But what else?

616
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:32,243
Nostalgia...

617
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:34,905
for my roots.

618
00:59:36,378 --> 00:59:39,469
I want the birth certificates
of my grandparents

619
00:59:39,545 --> 00:59:41,204
on both sides.

620
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,238
And mine too, naturally.

621
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:46,560
Why?

622
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:48,166
I told you.

623
00:59:48,444 --> 00:59:51,696
Nostalgia, curiosity.

624
01:00:00,677 --> 01:00:03,905
Don’t be an idiot, Robert.
Tell me why.

625
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:07,270
It’s nothing.

626
01:00:08,178 --> 01:00:11,474
A formality, a routine check.

627
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,407
These days, the Paris police

628
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,602
want to prove they exist.

629
01:00:17,677 --> 01:00:23,042
So a slight misunderstanding
must be cleared up.

630
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,176
What kind of misunderstanding?

631
01:00:27,077 --> 01:00:28,566
About my identity.

632
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:31,167
What’s that got to do
with your grandparents?

633
01:00:31,244 --> 01:00:33,436
Your own certificate
should be enough,

634
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:36,033
or mine and your mother’s
at the very most.

635
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,770
They want my grandparents’ too
to be sure.

636
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:42,271
Sure of what?

637
01:00:42,344 --> 01:00:44,207
My origins.

638
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:48,642
Well, yes.

639
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,870
I must prove I’m not a certain man
the police are looking for.

640
01:01:14,244 --> 01:01:17,310
How long have they given you?

641
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:21,010
Two weeks.

642
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,671
That’s quite enough.

643
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:28,633
It all sounds very strange.

644
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:32,409
Are you sure there isn’t
something more behind it?

645
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:35,204
It’s just a formality.

646
01:01:35,278 --> 01:01:37,210
There’s no real doubt.

647
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:40,209
So why do they want the certificates?

648
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,502
Because it’s the law.

649
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:48,267
And also...

650
01:01:52,845 --> 01:01:55,758
because there’s another Robert Klein.

651
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:58,167
And apparently he’s a Jew.

652
01:01:59,444 --> 01:02:00,966
A Jew?

653
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:05,072
Impossible!

654
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:10,102
Or it could be the Dutch branch.

655
01:02:10,844 --> 01:02:12,673
Are there Kleins in Holland?

656
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:15,488
Quite a different breed.

657
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:16,933
- But we’re related.
- I tell you,

658
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,766
we’ve been French and Catholic
since Louis XIV!

659
01:02:30,745 --> 01:02:32,233
Yes, miss.

660
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,367
Hello. Yes.

661
01:02:39,444 --> 01:02:40,569
What?

662
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:41,803
No, I’m all right.

663
01:02:41,877 --> 01:02:44,742
Three of the certificates
are here in Strasbourg.

664
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:48,107
But as for my maternal grandparents,

665
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:50,803
one of them was born in Marseilles.

666
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:54,654
Jules Marcel Bleard.

667
01:02:55,344 --> 01:02:58,434
Yes, B-L-F-A-R-D. You got it?

668
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,408
And my grandmother in Algiers.

669
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,702
Yeah, Algeria.

670
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:06,767
- No, she wasn’t an Arab.
- Imbecile!

671
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:09,367
Her father was a Communard
who was deported to Algeria.

672
01:03:10,044 --> 01:03:13,874
Okay. Send someone to Algiers
and Marseilles right away.

673
01:03:16,977 --> 01:03:18,341
Okay.

674
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,770
See you tomorrow.

675
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,370
That was my lawyer.

676
01:03:30,675 --> 01:03:33,967
So do you know
any of those Kleins from Holland?

677
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,654
I’ve heard about them.

678
01:03:38,844 --> 01:03:41,309
And this other Robert Klein?

679
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:46,471
Never.

680
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:39,970
Thank you.

681
01:07:48,576 --> 01:07:52,644
And now I’m going to do

682
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:55,736
what they ought to do!

683
01:07:59,777 --> 01:08:01,573
I will leave...

684
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:05,866
before you throw me out...

685
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:11,904
with a kick in the ass!

686
01:08:15,077 --> 01:08:16,736
Please, let’s go.

687
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:50,336
Mr. Klein!

688
01:10:06,044 --> 01:10:08,033
Maybe it’s not for me.

689
01:10:09,144 --> 01:10:11,167
He could be hiding in the crowd.

690
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,599
You think I’m crazy?

691
01:10:20,277 --> 01:10:22,175
What were you saying?

692
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:25,605
I sent my assistant to Ivry.

693
01:10:25,677 --> 01:10:28,371
The house is closed.
The owners left for Mexico.

694
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:31,675
Are they Jews as well?

695
01:10:32,777 --> 01:10:34,266
Probably.

696
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:39,802
Look, you can play at being
a detective, chasing ghosts,

697
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:41,536
but at least do what I say.

698
01:10:43,444 --> 01:10:45,069
We can’t go on waiting like fools

699
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:47,474
for papers that may never come.

700
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:48,873
Let’s try to get a --

701
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,039
I told you. I’m not a horse.

702
01:10:52,467 --> 01:10:54,871
I won’t have my nose or ears
or anything else measured.

703
01:10:54,943 --> 01:10:56,932
I detest veterinarians.

704
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,076
I’ll wait for the papers from Algiers.

705
01:11:00,144 --> 01:11:02,042
How can a man as distrustful as you

706
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:04,803
suddenly show such boundless
confidence in the post office,

707
01:11:04,877 --> 01:11:07,173
the railways, the bureaucracy,
and even the police!

708
01:11:07,244 --> 01:11:09,267
Because I’m a good Frenchman.

709
01:11:09,344 --> 01:11:11,434
I believe in our institutions,

710
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,669
including the phone system.

711
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,170
Was there a call for me?

712
01:11:21,863 --> 01:11:23,176
No, no one called.

713
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:33,940
I’m Mr. Klein.

714
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,999
There’s someone
asking for you on the phone --

715
01:11:36,077 --> 01:11:38,009
I mean, at the bar.

716
01:11:44,677 --> 01:11:46,667
Well, he was here.

717
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:49,739
He must have left.
That’s strange.

718
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,332
What did he look like?

719
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,968
Tall with dark hair.
Pretty much like you.

720
01:11:56,977 --> 01:11:59,000
Do you really think this man --

721
01:12:05,309 --> 01:12:07,832
You can’t!
The curfew’s in 30 minutes.

722
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:09,569
- Then I’ll spend the night.
- Where?

723
01:12:09,644 --> 01:12:11,007
I’ll rent the place.

724
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,508
- Why not?
- Well, first I have to see

725
01:12:13,576 --> 01:12:15,065
the administrator.

726
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,473
I’ll see him tomorrow.

727
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:25,436
Here’s the deposit.

728
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,669
No, I’m not allowed to --

729
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,504
- Fven if it’s for you?
- For me?

730
01:12:29,576 --> 01:12:31,440
- For your trouble.
- I don’t want it.

731
01:12:32,476 --> 01:12:34,806
You don’t really mean
to sleep here, do you?

732
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:35,900
Why not?

733
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:39,341
The police told me
not to let anyone in.

734
01:12:39,842 --> 01:12:40,342
And if they check--

735
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:42,104
I just want to have a look.

736
01:12:42,177 --> 01:12:43,506
But you’ve already seen it.

737
01:12:43,998 --> 01:12:45,235
I must see it again to decide.

738
01:12:46,077 --> 01:12:48,599
Did you hear
from that man Klein?

739
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:53,104
What about the girl?

740
01:12:53,177 --> 01:12:54,506
What’s her name again?

741
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:56,872
Isabelle.

742
01:12:56,943 --> 01:12:59,306
Isabelle. And her last name?

743
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,270
I never knew it.

744
01:15:05,843 --> 01:15:07,502
<i>Is that you, Robert?</i>

745
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,669
<i>I’m across the street.</i>

746
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,402
<i>I saw you at the window.</i>

747
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,808
<i>Did something happen?</i>

748
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:27,342
<i>Then why?</i>

749
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,773
Why what?

750
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,740
Someone keeps calling all the time.
Who was that?

751
01:16:04,843 --> 01:16:06,433
I don’t know.

752
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:08,536
It was a woman’s voice.

753
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,940
Did you give her
Mr. Klein’s new number?

754
01:16:12,665 --> 01:16:13,602
How stupid of me.

755
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:16,605
How could you know that?

756
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:46,235
There aren’t any Isabelles here.

757
01:16:59,677 --> 01:17:00,700
What is it, Gerard?

758
01:17:00,777 --> 01:17:02,436
This man’s looking for a girl.

759
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:05,869
Here I am.

760
01:17:05,943 --> 01:17:07,932
Her name is Isabelle.

761
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,840
Too bad.

762
01:17:16,276 --> 01:17:17,765
I don’t know her.

763
01:17:17,843 --> 01:17:19,775
There’s no one here named Isabelle.

764
01:17:23,877 --> 01:17:26,040
That’s not Isabelle. It’s Cathy.

765
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,272
She doesn’t work here anymore.

766
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,934
She left a month or two ago,

767
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:32,498
maybe even three.

768
01:17:32,576 --> 01:17:34,967
Do you know where she lives?

769
01:17:34,309 --> 01:17:35,969
With him, I think.

770
01:17:36,044 --> 01:17:37,883
God knows where.

771
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:38,899
Do you know him?

772
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:42,905
I saw him a couple of times
when he’d come for her.

773
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,000
Why?

774
01:17:46,883 --> 01:17:48,336
He’s no good.

775
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,603
A Corsican or an Arab.

776
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,539
Something like that.

777
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:56,441
A gangster, you know, or a pimp.

778
01:17:57,943 --> 01:18:00,623
And he plays the flute.

779
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,798
No, nothing.

780
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,808
In any case, he ruined her.

781
01:18:03,877 --> 01:18:06,274
She was such a nice, funny girl.

782
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:07,832
I saw her recently.

783
01:18:07,909 --> 01:18:10,535
She’s changed. Tough, distant.

784
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:13,869
- And those horrible overalls.
- Overalls?

785
01:18:15,443 --> 01:18:16,635
Come on, hurry up!

786
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,767
You’re on in 10 minutes!

787
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:23,072
- Will you wait for me?
- Yes.

788
01:18:23,943 --> 01:18:25,932
But first tell me where you saw her.

789
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:28,872
After the show.

790
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:30,774
Where did you see her?

791
01:18:30,843 --> 01:18:32,775
In the metro, at the Balard station.

792
01:18:32,843 --> 01:18:34,570
She was going to work.

793
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,302
Or so she said.

794
01:20:23,843 --> 01:20:25,639
Excuse me, miss.

795
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:27,369
Do you know this girl?

796
01:20:29,809 --> 01:20:31,842
Let me see.

797
01:20:32,843 --> 01:20:35,535
I don’t know her.
You know her?

798
01:20:35,609 --> 01:20:38,633
She’s not the type
to work in a factory.

799
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,471
What’s she got on her face?

800
01:20:40,543 --> 01:20:42,467
Foundation cream.

801
01:20:41,809 --> 01:20:43,469
- Do you use it?
- Sure.

802
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:46,342
Glycerin mixed with nitrate
and a little sulfur.

803
01:20:45,943 --> 01:20:47,704
It’s great for the skin.

804
01:20:49,581 --> 01:20:50,498
Are you sure she works here?

805
01:20:50,576 --> 01:20:52,405
I was told she was here.

806
01:20:53,843 --> 01:20:55,933
Yes, hustling.

807
01:20:57,043 --> 01:20:58,532
Well, that’s possible.

808
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:01,869
Is she your fiancée, by any chance?

809
01:21:01,943 --> 01:21:03,499
No, not yet.

810
01:21:03,998 --> 01:21:05,303
I’d like to know what she does.

811
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:09,274
Listen, the gentleman
is looking for this girl.

812
01:21:09,343 --> 01:21:11,366
He’s been asking if we know her.

813
01:21:11,443 --> 01:21:13,341
Yes, that’s Françoise.

814
01:21:13,409 --> 01:21:17,035
She’s the new girl.
She works in the detonator section.

815
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:18,769
Isn’t her name Cathy?

816
01:21:18,843 --> 01:21:20,502
No, it’s Françoise.

817
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:22,565
We had lunch together
a couple of times.

818
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:24,731
Michelle!

819
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:26,366
That girl works with her.

820
01:21:26,443 --> 01:21:27,999
Look at little Françoise.

821
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:42,842
No, that’s not Françoise.

822
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:49,769
Michelle, that was his picture.

823
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:53,436
Really?

824
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,601
I thought it was a joke.

825
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:57,370
I’m sorry.

826
01:21:58,643 --> 01:22:00,541
Never mind. I’ve got the negative.

827
01:22:00,609 --> 01:22:02,667
In any case, it’s not Françoise.

828
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:07,502
I don’t doubt it.

829
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:31,665
St. Lazare, Madeleine:

830
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:35,398
six minutes.

831
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,503
Etoile, Alma:

832
01:23:41,276 --> 01:23:43,217
ten minutes.

833
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:46,969
République, Châtelet:

834
01:23:48,044 --> 01:23:49,736
fifteen minutes.

835
01:23:52,176 --> 01:23:54,074
<i>Bastille, Montparnasse:</i>

836
01:23:56,643 --> 01:23:58,268
<i>Twenty-five minutes.</i>

837
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:07,541
Put that with the rest.

838
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:09,905
Hello, Inspector.

839
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:15,605
Report these gentlemen for trespassing
and breaking and entering.

840
01:25:16,276 --> 01:25:18,299
And for wasting my time,
which is money!

841
01:25:18,376 --> 01:25:19,364
Calm down.

842
01:25:20,576 --> 01:25:23,041
- Don’t be ridiculous.
- Me?

843
01:25:23,109 --> 01:25:26,166
They’re taking my papers,
my car, my paintings.

844
01:25:26,243 --> 01:25:28,738
I’m not allowed to buy or sell.

845
01:25:28,243 --> 01:25:31,039
No more bars, restaurants,
movie theaters, nothing.

846
01:25:31,108 --> 01:25:32,769
Everything’s forbidden.

847
01:25:32,843 --> 01:25:36,665
They say I can’t go anywhere,
not even to a public restroom.

848
01:25:37,415 --> 01:25:39,566
Just because my grandmother’s
certificate hasn’t arrived yet!

849
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:42,506
No, you can’t take that one!
It’s not for sale.

850
01:25:43,176 --> 01:25:45,967
This isn’t a piece of merchandise.
It belongs to me.

851
01:25:46,509 --> 01:25:49,634
Inspector, you do have
a warrant, of course?

852
01:25:51,476 --> 01:25:53,339
Here you are.

853
01:25:54,043 --> 01:25:57,771
Try to make him understand
it’s not personal.

854
01:25:57,843 --> 01:25:59,535
I’m not doing this for fun.

855
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:01,269
It’s the law.

856
01:26:01,943 --> 01:26:03,670
I’m not questioning the law.

857
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,833
It doesn’t concern me.

858
01:26:05,909 --> 01:26:08,068
I refuse to pay for another man!

859
01:26:08,143 --> 01:26:11,075
The prefecture reported your case.

860
01:26:11,143 --> 01:26:13,904
But I’m the one who reported
the case to the prefecture!

861
01:26:14,248 --> 01:26:15,442
This has nothing to do with me!

862
01:26:17,509 --> 01:26:19,738
That remains to be proved.

863
01:26:19,809 --> 01:26:23,742
It wouldn’t be the first time
that a man came forward,

864
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,866
the better to hide.

865
01:26:25,943 --> 01:26:28,915
What’s that? I don’t follow.

866
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:30,904
I was speaking in general.

867
01:26:30,976 --> 01:26:32,635
Please come now.

868
01:26:32,831 --> 01:26:35,175
You know the law.
Don’t make things difficult.

869
01:26:35,243 --> 01:26:37,258
All right.

870
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:39,373
Pierre.

871
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,436
- And the girl?
- She’s vanished.

872
01:26:42,509 --> 01:26:45,998
She hasn’t shown up for work,
and the address she gave them was false.

873
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,269
Nobody knows anything about her.

874
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:57,802
Yes. We’ll leave.

875
01:27:04,943 --> 01:27:06,999
<i>That’s about all of it.</i>

876
01:27:19,309 --> 01:27:22,241
When did you start writing music?

877
01:27:30,376 --> 01:27:32,727
Investigate all this.

878
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:36,774
I’d forgotten.

879
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:44,135
You play, don’t you?

880
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:47,092
- Just a little.
- Give it a try.

881
01:27:46,776 --> 01:27:48,503
What is it?

882
01:27:48,575 --> 01:27:51,132
It’s our friend’s.
It seems he composes now,

883
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:53,904
in the bathroom.

884
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:08,405
What is it, a military march?

885
01:28:08,475 --> 01:28:11,236
The way you play,
it could be anything.

886
01:28:15,276 --> 01:28:16,765
Stop that!

887
01:28:17,143 --> 01:28:19,132
Have you gone crazy?

888
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:27,205
Go on.

889
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:38,033
I knew you were stupid
but not that stupid!

890
01:28:44,475 --> 01:28:48,373
If I weren’t an idiot,
how could I trust you?

891
01:29:58,876 --> 01:30:03,035
I know where to get
a passport and a visa.

892
01:30:03,109 --> 01:30:04,768
All it takes is money.

893
01:30:07,008 --> 01:30:09,032
So first you find a buyer,

894
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:11,868
and when your passport’s ready,

895
01:30:11,942 --> 01:30:13,305
and at the last moment,

896
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,705
we’ll sell.

897
01:30:16,581 --> 01:30:17,834
I’ll sell.

898
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:21,008
Well, yes, of course.

899
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:22,398
You’ll sell.

900
01:30:26,676 --> 01:30:29,438
And how much is all of this worth?

901
01:30:29,509 --> 01:30:31,442
About 10 million.

902
01:30:33,876 --> 01:30:36,671
Would you settle

903
01:30:37,043 --> 01:30:38,702
for seven or eight?

904
01:30:45,308 --> 01:30:46,706
Forget it.

905
01:30:46,776 --> 01:30:48,799
Leave that to me.

906
01:30:49,676 --> 01:30:51,869
What are you thinking?

907
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:55,073
Nothing.

908
01:30:57,475 --> 01:31:00,374
In any case, I’m not selling,
and I’m not leaving.

909
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:28,868
Morning, Georges.

910
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,833
- Is he yours?
- No.

911
01:31:32,909 --> 01:31:35,931
I found him wandering
around here this morning.

912
01:31:36,009 --> 01:31:38,304
He must be lost.
He’s starving.

913
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,204
Why don’t you take him?

914
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:43,106
- Don’t you like dogs?
- Yes. Other people’s dogs.

915
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,767
- See you tomorrow.
- Good-bye.

916
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:57,566
Georges, call the dog.
He’s following me.

917
01:31:58,543 --> 01:32:01,331
I don’t know his name.

918
01:32:15,342 --> 01:32:17,400
Go on. Go away!

919
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:05,931
This is incredible.

920
01:33:06,008 --> 01:33:07,906
It looks like the same dog.

921
01:33:07,976 --> 01:33:10,217
Absolutely identical.

922
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:14,240
He was all alone outside,

923
01:33:15,742 --> 01:33:17,401
wandering around all night long.

924
01:33:18,475 --> 01:33:21,907
No one could abandon
such a beautiful dog, could they?

925
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:28,772
Come on.

926
01:33:28,842 --> 01:33:30,705
Let’s see if there’s
anything to eat.

927
01:34:25,075 --> 01:34:27,123
Excuse me.

928
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:30,034
Robert, listen.

929
01:34:30,275 --> 01:34:32,581
I’m going.

930
01:34:34,409 --> 01:34:35,500
Where?

931
01:34:37,175 --> 01:34:38,834
Have some coffee.

932
01:34:38,908 --> 01:34:40,568
Sit down.

933
01:34:59,542 --> 01:35:01,303
Pierre is right, you know.

934
01:35:02,442 --> 01:35:05,875
Three articles today,
just on the front page.

935
01:35:11,142 --> 01:35:13,633
Apart from the usual cartoons.

936
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:24,540
Look.

937
01:35:24,076 --> 01:35:25,939
This one’s pretty funny.

938
01:35:29,675 --> 01:35:31,403
Don’t you like it?

939
01:35:31,842 --> 01:35:33,069
Well,

940
01:35:34,575 --> 01:35:36,234
perhaps it’s a bit vulgar.

941
01:35:37,008 --> 01:35:38,941
But Pierre is right.

942
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:42,608
They’re getting the public
ready for something.

943
01:35:44,608 --> 01:35:46,098
It’s obvious.

944
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:50,369
Let’s see the classifieds.

945
01:35:51,488 --> 01:35:52,871
Lost and found.

946
01:35:56,475 --> 01:35:59,168
No, nothing about the dog.

947
01:36:09,123 --> 01:36:10,434
Shut up.

948
01:36:51,008 --> 01:36:52,837
I read about it in the paper.

949
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,365
Did they all die?

950
01:36:56,442 --> 01:36:58,101
Yes, all five of them.

951
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:08,305
There was enough TNT
in the sidecars to blow up half of Paris.

952
01:37:15,076 --> 01:37:17,633
Not just the Gestapo headquarters.

953
01:37:24,975 --> 01:37:27,634
The poor devils didn’t have much luck.

954
01:37:43,676 --> 01:37:45,608
You should leave now.

955
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:48,999
The guard must have
finished his meal.

956
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:52,734
I’ll show you out.

957
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,239
Was he a relative?

958
01:37:57,175 --> 01:37:58,834
A friend?

959
01:38:00,575 --> 01:38:02,064
Don’t worry.

960
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:05,602
I’d do the same thing
if I was a bit younger,

961
01:38:06,275 --> 01:38:07,866
or braver.

962
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:54,006
- Did you bring my papers?
- It was very difficult.

963
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:58,034
Here’s your passport.

964
01:39:00,142 --> 01:39:02,267
"De Guigny." An aristocrat?

965
01:39:02,342 --> 01:39:03,569
Probably.

966
01:39:04,908 --> 01:39:06,704
That’s the end of the Robert Kleins.

967
01:39:06,776 --> 01:39:08,832
One got blown up,
and the other--

968
01:39:08,908 --> 01:39:12,397
Here’s your ticket to Marseilles,
and one for the ship.

969
01:39:12,475 --> 01:39:14,031
It leaves in two days.

970
01:39:17,942 --> 01:39:19,800
The money?

971
01:39:20,308 --> 01:39:23,001
Of course.
But at the last minute --

972
01:39:24,175 --> 01:39:26,123
How much?

973
01:39:25,742 --> 01:39:29,003
- Or should I say, how much less?
- Half a million.

974
01:39:29,776 --> 01:39:33,367
Let me explain.
The buyer argued over the gold.

975
01:39:33,442 --> 01:39:35,771
In francs, he would’ve paid
twice as much.

976
01:39:35,842 --> 01:39:38,807
That doesn’t matter.
Half a million, well --

977
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:41,534
It’s quite reasonable and correct.

978
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,935
- Or almost.
- You don’t think I --

979
01:39:44,008 --> 01:39:46,803
No, of course not.

980
01:39:47,842 --> 01:39:50,138
- Should I count it?
- Yes, I want you to.

981
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:52,231
I’ll deny you that pleasure.

982
01:39:54,307 --> 01:39:55,797
Here you are.

983
01:39:56,363 --> 01:39:57,671
Keep your promise.

984
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,173
Don’t worry.
I’ve always wanted a dog like this.

985
01:40:00,243 --> 01:40:01,798
But he isn’t just any dog.

986
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:03,569
You can count on me.

987
01:40:05,976 --> 01:40:07,464
Well, good-bye.

988
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:16,973
- Good luck, Robert.
- Good luck to you.

989
01:40:17,043 --> 01:40:20,008
I must admit
I was getting fed up with France.

990
01:40:20,542 --> 01:40:23,531
We’re too civilized, too polite.

991
01:40:24,242 --> 01:40:26,790
Too many tabs are kept on us.

992
01:40:27,043 --> 01:40:28,701
Cheer up.

993
01:40:28,776 --> 01:40:30,434
You have half a million,

994
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,768
a fine dog,

995
01:40:32,842 --> 01:40:34,671
and above all, Nicole.

996
01:41:10,404 --> 01:41:12,205
Nicole told me.

997
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:14,832
- When will you be back?
- I don’t know.

998
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:18,060
- Soon?
- I don’t know.

999
01:41:18,842 --> 01:41:21,773
- After the war?
- Maybe. I don’t know.

1000
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:23,569
What about me?

1001
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:26,265
I really don’t know.

1002
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:33,536
I left the dog with Pierre.

1003
01:41:33,608 --> 01:41:36,473
But I don’t trust him.
Promise to look after the dog?

1004
01:41:36,642 --> 01:41:39,196
Yes.

1005
01:42:07,779 --> 01:42:08,801
Hello, Françoise.

1006
01:42:13,108 --> 01:42:14,768
Hello, Cathy.

1007
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:30,140
Hello...

1008
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:31,838
Isabelle.

1009
01:42:40,808 --> 01:42:41,967
Here.

1010
01:42:50,542 --> 01:42:52,201
Hello, Nathalie.

1011
01:42:54,342 --> 01:42:55,602
Hello.

1012
01:42:56,275 --> 01:42:58,764
See? You’ve got the wrong person.

1013
01:42:59,875 --> 01:43:01,068
Do I?

1014
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:06,106
No. You’re wrong not to trust me.

1015
01:43:11,571 --> 01:43:14,363
You don’t know it,
but we’re old friends, in a way.

1016
01:43:15,342 --> 01:43:17,330
We have an old friend in common.

1017
01:43:19,575 --> 01:43:21,438
Robert Klein.

1018
01:43:26,935 --> 01:43:27,797
You know Robert?

1019
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:30,773
Robert Klein,
3 2 Rue des Abbesses, second floor.

1020
01:43:31,442 --> 01:43:33,271
Poor Robert.

1021
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:38,171
We’ve left him all alone

1022
01:43:38,975 --> 01:43:42,668
with his ghastly, lovesick concierge.

1023
01:43:43,408 --> 01:43:45,601
He called her his kangaroo.

1024
01:43:50,941 --> 01:43:53,203
No, you’re not a friend of Robert’s.

1025
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:55,241
You just saw him at the station

1026
01:43:55,308 --> 01:43:57,240
and didn’t even say hello.

1027
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:01,469
You’re quite right.

1028
01:44:02,142 --> 01:44:04,505
I’m not his friend, nor is he mine.

1029
01:44:11,308 --> 01:44:13,696
Excuse me.

1030
01:44:59,242 --> 01:45:02,332
<i>- What is it?
- Open up. It’s me-- Robert.</i>

1031
01:45:09,175 --> 01:45:11,404
Quick!

1032
01:45:17,075 --> 01:45:18,904
- What’s happened?
- Nothing.

1033
01:45:18,975 --> 01:45:20,634
I need to make a call.

1034
01:45:23,269 --> 01:45:24,100
Hi, Nicole.

1035
01:45:29,508 --> 01:45:31,566
Go back to bed.

1036
01:45:34,275 --> 01:45:35,933
What about your ship?

1037
01:45:37,442 --> 01:45:39,202
I may not need to go now.

1038
01:45:39,274 --> 01:45:41,298
I don’t get it.
Who are you calling?

1039
01:45:43,007 --> 01:45:45,566
- Mr. Klein.
- But isn’t he dead?

1040
01:45:47,408 --> 01:45:49,068
So you found his number?

1041
01:45:50,274 --> 01:45:51,934
It never changed.

1042
01:45:53,108 --> 01:45:54,630
He never left.

1043
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:58,471
He put up a "For Rent" sign,
gave my card to the concierge,

1044
01:45:58,542 --> 01:46:00,201
and returned home every night.

1045
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:13,701
<i>Who’s calling?</i>

1046
01:46:21,207 --> 01:46:22,934
<i>I was looking for you too.</i>

1047
01:46:23,008 --> 01:46:24,667
<i>I’d like to talk to you.</i>

1048
01:46:25,242 --> 01:46:27,401
Fine. When?

1049
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:29,939
<i>- Whenever you like.
- Immediately.</i>

1050
01:46:30,007 --> 01:46:32,467
<i>All right. Where?</i>

1051
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:34,330
At your place in half an hour.

1052
01:46:34,408 --> 01:46:37,135
<i>- Do you have my address?
- Yes, I have your address.</i>

1053
01:46:37,207 --> 01:46:40,401
<i>Good. I’ll come down
in half an hour to let you in.</i>

1054
01:46:42,441 --> 01:46:44,134
You’re not really going, are you?

1055
01:46:46,142 --> 01:46:47,630
That’s why I came back.

1056
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:50,197
What do you mean?
This is ridiculous.

1057
01:46:50,274 --> 01:46:52,035
Send the police.

1058
01:46:53,352 --> 01:46:54,870
- This is personal.
- But if you --

1059
01:46:56,841 --> 01:46:59,398
I said it’s personal.

1060
01:48:47,808 --> 01:48:49,467
I had to do it.

1061
01:48:50,775 --> 01:48:52,764
He’s a criminal.

1062
01:48:52,841 --> 01:48:54,739
And I was afraid for you.

1063
01:52:14,307 --> 01:52:15,603
Mr. Klein?

1064
01:52:17,841 --> 01:52:19,363
Robert de Guigny.

1065
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:12,203
Where do you think they’re taking us?

1066
01:53:14,307 --> 01:53:15,967
I don’t know.

1067
01:53:17,474 --> 01:53:19,270
But there’s no need to worry.

1068
01:53:21,507 --> 01:53:23,665
Is there?

1069
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:25,500
It’s just a routine check.

1070
01:53:25,574 --> 01:53:27,631
I don’t know.

1071
01:53:30,508 --> 01:53:33,269
I hear they’re going
to turn us over to the Krauts

1072
01:53:33,341 --> 01:53:34,806
and send us to Germany.

1073
01:53:37,107 --> 01:53:39,029
But it can’t be true.

1074
01:53:39,607 --> 01:53:42,613
The French police would never do that.

1075
01:53:43,875 --> 01:53:45,533
Don’t you agree?

1076
01:53:45,607 --> 01:53:47,540
I don’t know anything.
How could I?

1077
01:53:47,608 --> 01:53:49,436
This has nothing to do with me!

1078
01:53:52,274 --> 01:53:53,933
I’m sorry.

1079
01:57:49,907 --> 01:57:51,567
Come on!

1080
01:58:53,473 --> 01:58:55,269
Look! I’ve got the certificates!

1081
01:58:55,941 --> 01:58:59,373
- I’ll be back.
- Robert, what are you doing?

1082
01:59:02,374 --> 01:59:04,033
I’ll be back.

1083
02:00:06,707 --> 02:00:08,435
<i>Six hundred louis.</i>

1084
02:00:08,807 --> 02:00:10,569
<i>Three hundred.</i>

1085
02:00:11,941 --> 02:00:14,202
<i>You must be joking</i>

1086
02:00:17,907 --> 02:00:20,339
<i>At that price, I’d rather keep it.</i>

1087
02:00:21,174 --> 02:00:22,867
<i>As you wish.</i>

1088
02:00:25,206 --> 02:00:28,105
<i>It’s easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell.</i>

1089
02:00:28,907 --> 02:00:31,169
<i>But I’m not forced to buy.</i>

1090
02:00:31,841 --> 02:00:34,033
<i>Make me a reasonable offer.</i>

1091
02:00:35,941 --> 02:00:37,735
<i>Three hundred.</i>
