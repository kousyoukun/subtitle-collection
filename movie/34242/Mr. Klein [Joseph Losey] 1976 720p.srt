1
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:37,623
Rounded gums...

2
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:44,248
Slight prognathism.

3
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:50,498
Nostrils arched...

4
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:56,623
Naso-labial space "normal".

5
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,706
Septum slightly flattened.

6
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:07,081
Lover lip fleshy.

7
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:12,873
Prognathous jaw typical
of non-European races.

8
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,414
Forehead narrow.

9
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:25,248
Scalp low.

10
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,081
Hair thick...

11
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,873
...oily, shiny.

12
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:36,789
Ears normal... lobes not fixed...

13
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,497
...slanted.

14
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:44,081
Upper eyelids dropping.

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,039
Skin swarthy.

16
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,914
Facial expression
more or less Jewish.

17
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:54,497
Attitudes during examination
not Jewish.

18
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,289
Now walk.

19
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,955
Hips naturally large
and flaccid.

20
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:07,414
On tiptoe now.

21
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,789
Soles of the feet flat.

22
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,622
Arch totally absent.

23
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,955
Get dressed.

24
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,080
In the opinion of the undersigned...

25
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:26,997
...based on morphological
and behavioural data...

26
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,705
...the person examined
could well belong...

27
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,830
...to the Semitic race.

28
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:40,080
Her ancestry
could be either Jewish...

29
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,413
Armenian...

30
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,538
...or Arab.

31
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:49,413
For now, the case
must be considered doubtful.

32
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,996
You can go.

33
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:01,621
How much do I owe you?

34
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:02,996
See my secretary.

35
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:06,038
You'll be notified
by the Prefecture of Police.

36
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:20,871
Fifteen francs.

37
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,078
How did it go?

38
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:05,578
All right.

39
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:07,912
What about you?

40
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:09,037
All right.

41
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:16,495
Did he tell you anything?

42
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:19,912
And you?

43
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,078
Mr. Klein?

44
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:32,911
Come in.

45
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,494
I don't know you.

46
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:54,494
I was told you might
be interested...

47
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:57,578
...in buying paintings.

48
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,619
Well... yes, I might be...

49
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,452
I have a painting...

50
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:23,494
<i>Snow, woven of quartz</i>
<i>and crystal...</i>

51
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,244
<i>Pendant drops...</i>

52
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:27,202
<i>Lacy arabesques...</i>

53
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:30,327
<i>Webs of icy silk...</i>

54
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:31,994
<i>Fable, dream...</i>

55
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:34,494
<i>...spell, illusion...</i>

56
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,785
<i>And suddenly...</i>

57
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,077
<i>...the blue glare</i>
<i>and the red blaze...</i>

58
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:42,410
<i>...of the young Phalangists.</i>

59
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,994
<i>The flower...</i>

60
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,369
<i>...the pride of France!</i>

61
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:47,827
<i>The paladins!</i>

62
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,785
<i>On the horizon,</i>
<i>the pinnacles of L eningrad...</i>

63
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:55,452
<i>...appear and disappear</i>
<i>like a mirage.</i>

64
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:57,910
Six hundred louis.

65
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,160
Three hundred.

66
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,327
You must be joking!

67
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,701
At the price,
I'd rather keep it.

68
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,951
As you like.

69
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,910
It's easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell!

70
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,451
But I'm not forced to buy!

71
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm not a collecter...

72
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,410
For me...

73
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,910
...it's just a job.

74
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:31,284
Make me a reasonable offer!

75
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:33,618
Three hundred.

76
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,576
Go back to bed.

77
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:53,784
Why?

78
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:56,034
Why? Why, do you think?

79
00:07:58,534 --> 00:07:59,242
Wait a minute.

80
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:01,117
Later... Go back to bed.

81
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,325
If it was a matter of francs...

82
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:41,533
...instead of gold louis...

83
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:44,867
Abroad, frames are worthless...

84
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,867
But if you need
the money in France...

85
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:51,783
I don't need it in France.

86
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,908
Very well...

87
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,866
Let's make out a receipt.

88
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:00,783
Just a formality... it's for me.

89
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:03,116
It'll stay in my safe.

90
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:09,700
There... write it yourself.

91
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:13,574
Unless you have a receipt
from whoever sold it to you.

92
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,908
We'we always had it in our house.

93
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,866
Always!

94
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,533
Well, perhaps my grandfather,
when he came from Holland...

95
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,949
...or perhaps, his father.

96
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:34,199
It's a long time ago...
it doesn't matter.

97
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,074
It's only a formality.
Now, would you write.

98
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,907
'I, the undersigned...'

99
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:44,241
...name, surname and address.

100
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,699
No, never mind the address!

101
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:53,491
Name, surname...

102
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,157
...'declare that I hereby make over...'

103
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,657
...'to Mr. Robert Klein...'

104
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,657
...'for an agreed sum...'

105
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,324
...'acceptable to me...'

106
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:20,198
...'agreed sum acceptable to me...'

107
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,490
...'a painting by A. Van Ostade...'

108
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,240
...'fifty centimetres by thirty...'

109
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:38,740
...'this painting being the portrait...'

110
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,531
...'of a Dutch gentleman.'

111
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:54,573
...'Paris, 16th January, 1942.'

112
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,448
And your signature.

113
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:10,281
Have you got a purse...
something to put it in?

114
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,239
No, but it doesn't matter.

115
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,156
Won't you count it?

116
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,531
Wait... I'll give you a present.

117
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:37,614
Thank you. Don't bother.

118
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:45,947
May I take one?

119
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:51,864
I have friends in the same situation,
and perhaps they...

120
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:55,905
Yes, of course.
Although I'd rather...

121
00:11:56,947 --> 00:12:01,405
Recently, I've seen many clients
like you, urgently needing to sell.

122
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,905
I assure you
it's most unpleasant for me.

123
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,613
Embarrassing...

124
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:10,405
Very often...
I would rather not buy.

125
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,947
Don't buy, then!

126
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:33,863
Your newspaper.

127
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:36,030
You must've dropped it.

128
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,738
<i>Jewish Information.</i>

129
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:46,654
You are right...

130
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:49,071
...it's my name, my address.

131
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:52,363
The postman left it by your door.

132
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,488
Bon voyage... and good luck.

133
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,779
Good luck to <i>you,</i> Mr. Klein!

134
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,071
<i>Blue...</i>

135
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,487
Indifference... a straight line
suspended in the sky.

136
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,612
White... Cruelty!

137
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:30,487
An acute angle with the point
driven into the ground.

138
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,654
Black... Arrogance!

139
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:37,612
A pyramid with its base
sunk into the sea.

140
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:41,404
And purple... Greed!

141
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,445
In the central circle, we see...

142
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,112
...remorse!

143
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:46,862
A vulture...

144
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:51,445
Its heart is pierced by an arrow,
but it continues to fly.

145
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,528
In each of the four corners...

146
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:56,445
...woven in different colours...

147
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:59,237
...the ancient cabalistic symbols.

148
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:02,237
For this splendid tapestry...

149
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,403
...the bidding will start
at 150.000 francs.

150
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,778
You promised to advise me...

151
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,653
No, the console table.

152
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:20,986
Did you forget?

153
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,945
The console table! There's time.

154
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,194
I want some coffee. I'll be back.

155
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,486
The tapestry.
What do you think of it?

156
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:32,569
I think it's got the evil eye.

157
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:35,568
<i>NO JEWS</i>

158
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:51,068
I telephoned just now.

159
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,776
This morning I received your paper.
Addressed to me.

160
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,943
I'm not a subscriber
and I've no intention...

161
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:04,860
I mean, I've no reason to be.

162
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:08,818
Isn't your paper
only sent to subscribers?

163
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:14,234
It's our only way to keep
the community informed...

164
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,318
...about meetings, decisions...

165
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,109
...new measures
set up by the authorities, etc.

166
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,401
I see...

167
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,734
...but I don't belong to your...

168
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,068
Yes, I understand.

169
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,359
It is strange.

170
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,151
Unless someone else...

171
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,401
Perhaps a friend of yours...

172
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,484
...has subscribed for you.

173
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:38,734
It isn't possible!

174
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:42,109
No one would play
that sort of joke on me.

175
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:48,901
You think we are a subject
for jokes?

176
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,317
No, I didn't mean that...

177
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:57,650
...but the very idea
seems so absurd.

178
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,734
Excuse me.

179
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,275
So you no longer wish
to get our newspaper?

180
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,734
Exactly.

181
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,650
I would also like to know
why you sent it to me.

182
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,983
I understand... unfortunately...

183
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:19,108
...we must wait until the Prefecture
returns our list of subscribers.

184
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,858
Then, we can check.

185
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,108
The Prefecture of Police.

186
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:28,025
You give your lists to the police?

187
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:33,191
They've allowed and advised us
to publish this newspaper.

188
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:37,358
As I told you,
it's the only way we have...

189
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,191
Yes, I understand.

190
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,066
The Prefecture, but where?

191
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,983
The Commission for Jewish Affairs.

192
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,733
Robert Klein, did you say?

193
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,691
Like that?

194
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,441
Address?

195
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:19,232
136, rue du Bac.

196
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:22,524
How long have you lived there?

197
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:25,691
About seven years.
Since I came to Paris.

198
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,399
Yes, in fact...

199
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,899
There is a Robert Klein.

200
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,524
But with another address.

201
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,524
Obviously a man
with the same name.

202
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,065
May I have his address?

203
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:49,440
What would you say if I gave yours
to anyone who asked for it?

204
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,982
Where did you say you lived?

205
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:14,815
The fact is someone
wrote my name on the paper.

206
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:18,565
You understand my anxiety?

207
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:20,856
Perfectly.

208
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:25,315
It's curiosity more than anxiety,
the fact that someone...

209
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:33,231
I'm sorry...
I'm taking up your time.

210
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:36,440
This cannot interest the police!

211
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:42,689
Luckily for me!

212
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,772
Moby Dick. What does it mean?
Is it a name?

213
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,730
A woman?

214
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,188
No... a whale.

215
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,938
He's exactly like me!

216
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,271
Who's that?

217
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:24,479
Ishmael!

218
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,604
Listen to this!

219
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,563
'Sixteen hours in bed!'

220
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:33,271
'The small of my back ached.'

221
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:35,354
'I felt worse and worse.'

222
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,813
'At last I got up...'

223
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:42,604
...'and threw myself at her feet,
beseeching her to beat me...'

224
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,646
...'to do anything indeed...'

225
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:47,854
...'but condemn me to lie abed...'

226
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:52,021
...'such an unendurable length of time.'

227
00:22:05,395 --> 00:22:07,062
Can I get up?

228
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,229
Do me a favour,
take another book.

229
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:17,562
The one with the rose binding.

230
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:43,937
Page forty-seven...

231
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:45,978
'Pale and trembling like doves...'

232
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:47,978
...'the three maidens entered the room.'

233
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:50,061
'In the dancing firelight...'

234
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,228
...'it looked even more imposing
and fantastic...'

235
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,811
It's not possible!

236
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,561
Go on.

237
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,395
I can't!

238
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:01,270
Go on!

239
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:07,728
'...imposing and fantastic...'

240
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:11,103
'That enormous penis...'

241
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:13,269
'Tumescent...'

242
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,103
'Superb...'

243
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,478
'Alive!'

244
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,435
I know very little about him.

245
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:59,852
I never saw much of him.

246
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,269
The girl took care of everything.

247
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,977
A brunette...

248
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:05,727
Pretty sexy...

249
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,019
I think she was a whore...

250
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,310
...or a dancer.

251
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:14,935
He only went out at night,
when I was in bed.

252
00:24:15,852 --> 00:24:19,852
Around midnight, after the curfew,
I'd hear him come down the stairs.

253
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,852
And the morning I saw him...

254
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:26,477
...it was about five.
I was putting out the rubbish.

255
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,810
Oh, look!

256
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,935
You're Mr. Klein, aren't you?
First floor?

257
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,476
No... no, I'm sorry.

258
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:40,851
I'm not <i>your</i> Mr. Klein.

259
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:42,893
Excuse me.

260
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,268
I thought you were...

261
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:48,643
Same height, same hair...

262
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:51,434
Slim. The same look...

263
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:54,643
But I never saw his face.

264
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:57,893
What do you want?

265
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:01,684
It's about the apartment,
is it still free?

266
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,601
If you don't mind
waiting a minute.

267
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:05,934
Not at all.

268
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,351
We've finished.
What about the visiting card?

269
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:10,726
Yes... here you are.

270
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:15,184
Wait, I'll write down
the address for his mail.

271
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:16,809
Does he still get mail?

272
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,517
Yes, not much.

273
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,434
One newspaper. One letter.

274
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:22,392
Nothing else.

275
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,767
So you want to move in here?

276
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:30,892
No, it's for a friend
who's coming to Paris.

277
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:37,100
If you hear anything, call us.

278
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,850
Yes, certainly...

279
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
The apartment,
you really want to see it?

280
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,850
Wallpaper's got to be changed,
it's rotten.

281
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:09,892
Ceiling needs painting.

282
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:14,808
Toilet bowl's got to be changed.

283
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,850
You'd have to get rid
of the rats.

284
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,433
Yes, rats!

285
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:23,141
Look at that!

286
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,725
All over the place!

287
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:38,808
It's not a place for you.

288
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:41,433
Anyway,
if you're interested...

289
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,766
...it's 50 francs a month.

290
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,183
Enormous!

291
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:48,391
Plus electricity
and cleaning the stairs.

292
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:12,474
He had a dog?

293
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:15,724
Yes, an alsatian.

294
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:19,515
Sometimes he'd bark,
and then whimper...

295
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:22,557
...as if he was being beaten.

296
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:51,807
My husband said a house
is judged by its lavatory...

297
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,432
...and he was right!

298
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:58,348
Well, haven't you seen enough?

299
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:00,973
The shower.

300
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,390
The shower?
It's out of order.

301
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:23,389
What's wrong?

302
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:28,098
I'm sorry...

303
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:30,931
Since my husband went...

304
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:32,306
I get funny.

305
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,098
Every now and then...

306
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,431
I have these hallucinations.

307
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,472
Is your husband dead?

308
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,014
No, he's in Germany.

309
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:48,639
Prisoner of war.

310
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,680
Yes, I remember.

311
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,764
A pretty girl...
and a beautiful dog.

312
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:18,597
You, on the other hand...
your face was hidden!

313
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:21,722
But you're recognizable.

314
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:24,930
That sidecar...
you still have it?

315
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,555
No, it blew up!

316
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,097
May I?

317
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:56,137
Who's this skeleton
in your house?

318
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,554
What skeleton?

319
00:30:57,804 --> 00:30:58,595
That whore!

320
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:00,637
What do you mean?

321
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:04,387
A girl called Janine.

322
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,887
She's a friend.

323
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,345
Why did I find her here?

324
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,053
Because you got here after!

325
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,428
But she was alone in the house!

326
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:35,178
Because she got here before!

327
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,136
Is your husband here?

328
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:48,886
And two policemen
are waiting for you.

329
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:18,094
Sorry, I'm late...

330
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:26,136
They're waiting for you.

331
00:32:26,386 --> 00:32:27,511
Yes, your wife told me.

332
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:28,677
What's going on?

333
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:31,219
Nothing... I'll explain later.

334
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:43,219
I think we've met before.

335
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,677
We have the same impression.

336
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:48,469
Did you take that apartment
for your friend?

337
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:51,427
I haven't decided yet.

338
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:55,135
We've brought back your card.

339
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:56,718
Thank you very much.

340
00:32:57,218 --> 00:33:00,177
I have a terrible habit
of handing them around.

341
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:02,635
How about a drink?

342
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:05,718
No, thank you.
But we can wait.

343
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:08,843
Are we going somewhere?

344
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:10,343
Pigalle Police station.

345
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,468
Again?
I went there after I saw you!

346
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:15,718
I spoke to the inspector
5 minutes ago!

347
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,635
Pierre!
Please turn down the gramophone.

348
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:23,968
Nicole, will you get me a beer?

349
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:32,218
Maybe you should ring him,
that would save time.

350
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:39,509
Pigalle 30-30.

351
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:44,134
Call him, François.

352
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:46,134
- May I?
- Go right ahead.

353
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,259
Bastard!

354
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:03,551
Inspector...
we're with Mr. Klein...

355
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:10,634
Yes, sir... very well.

356
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,467
Who could this other Klein be?

357
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:19,050
I've no idea.

358
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,800
I first heard about him
at the Prefecture.

359
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,467
Our orders came from the Prefecture!

360
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,634
Anyway,
if you hear anything...

361
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,592
Don't worry,
it's in my interest.

362
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,008
I don't like this business.

363
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,758
So it's a man who's got
the same name... a Jew!

364
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:10,466
He's gone off
and left you with his problem!

365
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:12,466
How could he know about me?

366
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:15,091
Your visiting cards
are all over Paris!

367
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:16,508
It doesn't make sense!

368
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:19,716
Does he hope that I'll shut up
and take his place?

369
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,924
It's a man with a grudge
against me...

370
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:25,841
...trying to get me into trouble,
to provoke me...

371
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,133
Why should he have a grudge?

372
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,258
And why not?

373
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,088
'My love...'

374
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:22,755
...'what interminable months!'

375
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:27,588
'In 2 days it'll be our January 26th.
I'm here, waiting for you.'

376
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:31,755
'The train for Ivry-la-Bataille
still leaves at six-fifteen.'

377
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,963
'You mustn't miss it,
you know that?'

378
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,713
'Because this time, I swear...'

379
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,921
...'you'd lose me,
and that would be awful...'

380
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:41,796
'My darling!'

381
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,754
'Florence.'

382
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:51,171
You mustn't miss it...

383
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,879
...this time, it would be awful,
my darling.

384
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,211
Have you any luggage?

385
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:24,920
This way, sir.

386
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:38,502
Good evening, Mr Klein.

387
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:40,335
Please, come in.

388
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,918
They're expecting you.

389
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,460
May I take your coat?

390
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:03,959
Charles-Xavier.

391
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,667
Your host.

392
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,583
I know, it's a complicated story.

393
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:25,000
Come, it's quieter in there.

394
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,667
Yes, then I can explain...

395
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,666
Can you imagine Robert living in Pigalle?

396
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,541
In a furnished room!

397
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,457
In lodgings, rue des Abbesses!

398
00:44:17,707 --> 00:44:20,499
It's impossible! It's absurd!

399
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,416
This gentleman has the same name.

400
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:24,249
Really? Like Robert?

401
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:25,999
Isn't it funny!

402
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:27,832
Please, sit down.

403
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:31,457
What was Robert doing in Pigalle?

404
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:32,791
Nothing.

405
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,957
I don't think he was ever there.

406
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:37,665
Then God knows why this letter...

407
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:39,165
...was sent to him in Pigalle!

408
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:42,499
That's right... there's a letter.

409
00:44:43,165 --> 00:44:44,582
They're waiting for us.

410
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:46,707
Couldn't we read it after dinner?

411
00:44:46,957 --> 00:44:48,749
It's only a few lines.

412
00:44:49,665 --> 00:44:51,290
We're all starving!

413
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:54,124
Yes... I see your point.

414
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,915
But if you knew Robert as well as I do.

415
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:00,873
I cannot accept your theory!

416
00:45:01,123 --> 00:45:03,748
We can't be talking
about the same person!

417
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:06,248
Let's go in to dinner. Will you stay?

418
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,623
Thank you, I must go back to Paris.

419
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,332
There's a train quite soon.

420
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,707
There are no more trains tonight.

421
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:13,748
No, only on odd days.

422
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:17,540
You see? Now, you have no excuse!

423
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:19,665
There must be a hotel near there...

424
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:21,165
Requisitioned.

425
00:45:21,998 --> 00:45:23,248
Don't worry, you're my guest.

426
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:25,415
Anyhow...

427
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:29,665
...we did invite you in a way, didn't we?

428
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:32,706
Come on...
now you have no more excuses.

429
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,872
No, don't move!

430
00:46:06,122 --> 00:46:07,831
Don't turn on the light!

431
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:16,747
Don't turn on the light!

432
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:19,789
My letter...

433
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:23,330
Do you mind giving it back to me?

434
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:27,164
Do you mind turning round?

435
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,164
I sleep naked.

436
00:46:57,163 --> 00:46:58,413
Tell me...

437
00:47:00,997 --> 00:47:03,288
...does your friend happen to be Jewish?

438
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:05,996
Robert? I don't think so.

439
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:09,788
As far as I know, he's an atheist.

440
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,746
Yet he subscribes to a Jewish paper!

441
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,205
That's possible. He reads a lot.

442
00:47:16,496 --> 00:47:17,788
And talks very little!

443
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,163
Who told you that? On the contrary.

444
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:23,413
Then what did he tell you about me?

445
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:25,538
Nothing.

446
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:27,996
He never mentionned you.

447
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:29,871
No letter then!

448
00:47:37,246 --> 00:47:40,704
I know what Robert
would say if he was here!

449
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:44,413
First, he'd compare you
to an animal or an insect!

450
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:48,912
His theory is based on what he calls...

451
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:52,621
...the infinite variety
of specialized instincts.

452
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:54,954
- How fascinating!
- Isn't it?

453
00:47:55,204 --> 00:47:58,329
He claims that in animals
and insects...

454
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:00,537
...this variety appears...

455
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:02,829
...in many different species.

456
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,162
But in man this is not possible...

457
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:08,079
...as there's only one human species.
Therefore...

458
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:09,745
I get the point.

459
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:21,037
The eyes are important!

460
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:22,537
The mouth.

461
00:48:22,954 --> 00:48:24,787
The curve of the lips.

462
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:27,953
Feeling of superiority over others.

463
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:29,870
Sense of freedom.

464
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:31,787
Egoism.

465
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,203
A bird...

466
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:34,662
Of prey!

467
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,078
Falcon!

468
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:37,537
Vulture.

469
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:38,370
Why?

470
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,578
Do I eat corpses?

471
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,995
You don't return letters.

472
00:48:49,703 --> 00:48:51,745
How about your friend?

473
00:48:53,703 --> 00:48:56,203
What animal has he chosen for himself?

474
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,286
The eagle? The lion?

475
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:01,036
The snake.

476
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:05,120
A hibernating snake...
waiting for a better season.

477
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,328
I can't understand
why he got you into this mess.

478
00:49:12,203 --> 00:49:14,328
So he could hide, I think.

479
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,744
Disappear behind another man.

480
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:19,619
Me!

481
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:21,661
No, he's not a coward.

482
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,994
He wouldn't harm anyone.

483
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:25,786
Except himself, perhaps.

484
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:29,452
Or else for revenge.
Yes, then he might.

485
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:31,619
Revenge? But what for?

486
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,661
I don't even know him!

487
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:37,577
You know what I thought
when I saw you?

488
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:43,619
That Robert himself
had sent you.

489
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:44,952
Why?

490
00:49:45,202 --> 00:49:48,161
To explain to me
why he hadn't come.

491
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:51,619
To see how I'd react...
to provoke me...

492
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,619
...to humiliate me.

493
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,202
I don't understand.

494
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,994
Yes, as if to tell me...

495
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:01,119
'I'm sending another man,
but for you it'll be the same!'

496
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,244
He could do that!

497
00:50:07,077 --> 00:50:09,744
It seems a little extreme,
don't you think?

498
00:50:09,994 --> 00:50:12,493
He could very well do that!

499
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:19,993
What if it was so?

500
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,993
Suppose that's why I came!

501
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:26,285
He loves that sort of situation!

502
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:28,702
So do I.

503
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,993
What about you?

504
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:33,201
Even if it's a false situation?

505
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:34,826
Especially!

506
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:39,368
Or... let us suppose...

507
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:45,576
It's very late. I must go.

508
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,910
My husband must be looking for me.

509
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:45,324
We forgot to say good night.

510
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:50,616
Whenever that happens,
I can't sleep.

511
00:52:57,158 --> 00:52:59,824
I see you have the same problem!

512
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:12,782
Do you realize
I could go to the police?

513
00:53:17,616 --> 00:53:19,365
Then you must talk!

514
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:22,240
Where is he?

515
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:24,574
I swear I don't know.

516
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:29,074
I'll start at the beginning.

517
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:32,449
Where did he live before Pigalle?

518
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:36,199
In a hotel... rue de I'Université.

519
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:40,073
When did you learn about Pigalle?

520
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:41,907
Two months ago.

521
00:53:42,907 --> 00:53:44,907
Through a messenger boy...

522
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:48,282
...who brought me his flute and a note.

523
00:53:49,948 --> 00:53:51,615
What did the note say?

524
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:53,948
Nothing.

525
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:57,865
Jokes, as always.

526
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:00,073
He was going into hibernation...

527
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:04,531
...and I was to keep his flute
until a better season.

528
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:07,573
Into hibernation, where?

529
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:12,656
I don't know. He didn't say.

530
00:54:13,906 --> 00:54:14,906
Very well.

531
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,740
The police will find out.

532
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:23,406
You, your husband
and all your musical zoo...

533
00:54:23,656 --> 00:54:25,573
...will be called in for questioning.

534
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:30,281
No! Please don't do that!

535
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:33,573
I'm sorry, Florence.

536
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:36,364
One way or another I must find out...

537
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:38,989
...what this man wants from me.

538
00:54:48,614 --> 00:54:51,072
A pity about last night!

539
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:53,906
Just a moment!

540
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:57,031
All right!

541
00:54:58,156 --> 00:55:02,572
But first, swear
you won't go to the police.

542
00:55:14,155 --> 00:55:15,489
I swear.

543
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,613
136 rue du Bac.

544
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:21,570
You have the present?

545
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,903
I didn't sleep all night!

546
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:25,528
Neither did I... You have it?

547
00:57:25,778 --> 00:57:28,528
You coulďve told me.
People came for you.

548
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,695
What for?

549
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:31,236
I don't know.

550
00:58:02,736 --> 00:58:03,903
Is it serious?

551
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:17,486
Tell me... the Kleins...
are they French-French?

552
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:20,569
Or are there Jews
in your family?

553
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:28,152
Indifference...

554
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:31,277
...is like a still, flat sea...

555
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:33,735
...around a drowning man.

556
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,360
Like a flock of sheep...

557
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:41,485
...grazing in the ruins of a village.

558
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:43,777
Or like a worm...

559
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:48,152
...crawling over a putrid wound.

560
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:55,027
A man can be mean, selfish,
hypocritical, anything!

561
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:59,443
As long as he's aware!

562
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:03,402
The result is the same.

563
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:06,318
No, not exactly.

564
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:09,443
Have you ever heard of remorse?

565
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:15,401
It's like a vulture
pierced by an arrow...

566
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:17,943
...but it continues to fly.

567
00:59:18,193 --> 00:59:20,026
Oh, it's you!

568
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:22,943
What's the matter?

569
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,901
Why are you here?

570
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:27,110
To see you.

571
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,901
Yes, of course, but what else?

572
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:31,360
Nostalgia...

573
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,318
...for my roots.

574
00:59:35,734 --> 00:59:38,693
I want the birth certificates
of my grandparents.

575
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:40,859
On both sides.

576
00:59:41,818 --> 00:59:43,443
And mine too, naturally.

577
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:45,193
And why?

578
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:47,276
I told you.

579
00:59:48,026 --> 00:59:50,693
Nostalgia... curiosity.

580
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:03,442
Don't be idiotic, Robert.
Tell me why!

581
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:06,276
It's nothing.

582
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:10,609
A formality... a routine check.

583
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,692
The police, these days, in Paris...

584
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,900
...they want to prove they exist!

585
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,275
And so...

586
01:00:18,775 --> 01:00:22,775
...a slight misunderstanding
has to be cleared up.

587
01:00:23,067 --> 01:00:25,400
What sort of misunderstanding?

588
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:27,859
About my identity.

589
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:28,817
What's it got to do...

590
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:30,275
...with your grandparents?

591
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:32,692
Your own certificate should be enough.

592
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:35,275
Or mine at the most, and your mother's.

593
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:38,733
They want the grandparent's too,
to be sure.

594
01:00:39,442 --> 01:00:41,400
Sure of what?

595
01:00:42,192 --> 01:00:43,400
Of my origins.

596
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,817
Well, yes...

597
01:00:48,192 --> 01:00:51,108
I must prove I'm not a man
the police are looking for.

598
01:01:13,483 --> 01:01:15,983
How long have they given you?

599
01:01:18,774 --> 01:01:19,858
Fifteen days.

600
01:01:20,899 --> 01:01:22,649
That's quite enough.

601
01:01:23,858 --> 01:01:28,233
It all sounds very strange.

602
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:31,441
Really nothing more?

603
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:34,108
It's just a formality.

604
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,149
There's no real doubt.

605
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:39,732
So why do they want the certificates?

606
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,399
Because it's the law!

607
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:54,899
Also, there's another Robert Klein.

608
01:01:55,441 --> 01:01:57,691
Apparently, he is a Jew.

609
01:02:03,649 --> 01:02:04,982
It's impossible!

610
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:08,940
Or it could be the Dutch branch.

611
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:11,607
Are there Kleins in Holland?

612
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:13,982
Oh, quite a different breed!

613
01:02:14,274 --> 01:02:15,732
But we're related!

614
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:20,690
We've been French and Catholic
since Louis xIV!

615
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:40,898
No, I'm all right.

616
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:44,356
Three of the certificates
are here in Strasbourg.

617
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:47,148
But my maternal grandparents...

618
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:49,856
One was born in Marseilles.

619
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:57,481
Yes, B-l-e-a-r-d, you got it?

620
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:00,106
And my grandmother in Algiers.

621
01:03:03,189 --> 01:03:04,398
No, she wasn't Arab!

622
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:05,939
Imbecile!

623
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:07,731
Daughter of a deported Communard!

624
01:03:10,023 --> 01:03:11,981
Send someone
to Algiers and Marseilles now.

625
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:19,481
See you tomorrow.

626
01:03:23,064 --> 01:03:24,439
My lawyer.

627
01:03:29,231 --> 01:03:33,397
Those Kleins from Holland...
do you know them?

628
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:36,772
I've heard about them.

629
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:40,356
And this other Robert Klein?

630
01:03:44,564 --> 01:03:45,980
Never!

631
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,727
Now, I'm going to do...

632
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,476
...what "they" ought to do!

633
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:01,143
Leave!

634
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:04,643
Before you throw me out...

635
01:08:09,143 --> 01:08:12,101
...with a kick in the arse!

636
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:16,434
Let's go please!

637
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:07,891
Maybe, it's not for me.

638
01:10:08,933 --> 01:10:11,141
He could be hiding in the crowd.

639
01:10:14,099 --> 01:10:15,349
You think I'm mad?

640
01:10:20,057 --> 01:10:21,516
What were you saying?

641
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:25,182
I sent my assistant to Ivry.

642
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:28,099
The house is closed...
they gone to Mexico.

643
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:31,349
Are they Jews too?

644
01:10:32,599 --> 01:10:33,724
Probably.

645
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:39,557
Look, you can play
at being a detective, chasing ghosts.

646
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:41,265
But at least do what I say!

647
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,807
We can't go on waiting like fools...

648
01:10:45,099 --> 01:10:47,515
...for papers which may never come!

649
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:48,599
Let's try to get a...

650
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:51,932
No. I told you I'm not a horse!

651
01:10:52,265 --> 01:10:54,599
I won't have my nostrils
measured or my ears, etc.

652
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:57,099
I detest veterinaries.

653
01:10:57,349 --> 01:10:59,807
I'll wait for the papers from Algiers.

654
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:03,348
A cautious man like you,
showing such confidence...

655
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:06,890
...in the post office, the railways,
bureaucracy... and the police!

656
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:08,848
I'm a good Frenchman.

657
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,098
I believe in our institutions!

658
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:12,390
Including the phone!

659
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:20,682
Was there a call for me?

660
01:11:20,932 --> 01:11:22,431
No... no one rang.

661
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,598
I am Mr Klein.

662
01:11:33,848 --> 01:11:35,723
Someone was asking for you...

663
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,931
...at the bar.

664
01:11:44,348 --> 01:11:46,098
Well... he was here!

665
01:11:47,348 --> 01:11:49,389
He must've gone... that's strange!

666
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,806
What was he like?

667
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:54,598
Tall... with dark hair...
pretty much like you.

668
01:11:56,681 --> 01:11:59,389
Do you really think this man?

669
01:12:05,056 --> 01:12:07,306
You can't! The curfew's in 30 minutes!

670
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,222
- I'll sleep here.
- Where?

671
01:12:09,472 --> 01:12:10,556
I'll rent the place.

672
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:11,514
Why not?

673
01:12:11,764 --> 01:12:13,222
Well, first I have to see...

674
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:14,681
...the administrator.

675
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:17,139
I'll see him tomorrow.

676
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:25,014
Here's the deposit.

677
01:12:25,264 --> 01:12:27,264
No, I'm not allowed to...

678
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:29,014
What if it's for you?

679
01:12:29,264 --> 01:12:31,305
- For your trouble.
- I don't want it.

680
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,805
You don't really mean
to sleep here, do you?

681
01:12:35,014 --> 01:12:35,639
Why not?

682
01:12:36,055 --> 01:12:38,930
The police told me
not to let anyone in.

683
01:12:39,139 --> 01:12:40,055
And if they check...

684
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,930
I just want to have a look.

685
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,055
But you've seen it!

686
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:45,513
I must see it again to decide.

687
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:48,347
This man Klein...
did you hear from him?

688
01:12:51,555 --> 01:12:52,763
What about the girl?

689
01:12:53,013 --> 01:12:54,222
What's her name again?

690
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:55,972
Isabelle!

691
01:12:58,222 --> 01:12:59,805
And her last name?

692
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:02,930
I never knew.

693
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,220
<i>Is that you, Robert?</i>

694
01:15:09,803 --> 01:15:13,136
<i>I'm accross the street...</i>
<i>I saw you at the window.</i>

695
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:20,219
<i>Did something happen?</i>

696
01:15:25,178 --> 01:15:26,803
<i>Then why?</i>

697
01:15:29,678 --> 01:15:31,678
Why what?

698
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,844
Someone keeps ringing.

699
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,969
Who was it?

700
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:07,927
I don't know... it was a woman's voice.

701
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:11,010
Did you give her
Mr Klein's new number?

702
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,510
How stupid of me!

703
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:16,135
How could you know it!

704
01:16:43,635 --> 01:16:45,801
We have no Isabelle here.

705
01:16:59,426 --> 01:17:00,384
What is it, Gérard?

706
01:17:00,593 --> 01:17:02,468
This man's looking for a girl.

707
01:17:04,426 --> 01:17:05,551
Here I am!

708
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:07,968
<i>Well, her</i> name is Isabelle.

709
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:11,551
Too bad!

710
01:17:16,176 --> 01:17:19,467
I don't know her.
No one here's called Isabelle.

711
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:22,092
Look...

712
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,551
That's not Isabelle, it's Cathy!

713
01:17:26,092 --> 01:17:27,676
She isn't here any more.

714
01:17:27,926 --> 01:17:32,009
She left two months ago...
maybe three.

715
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:33,884
Know where she lives?

716
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:37,134
With him, I think...
God knows where!

717
01:17:37,384 --> 01:17:38,759
Do you know him?

718
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:42,925
I saw him a couple of times,
when he came for her.

719
01:17:46,425 --> 01:17:47,717
He's no good.

720
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:50,675
A Corsican... or an Arab.

721
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:53,092
Something like that.

722
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:56,342
He's a gangster, you see...
or a pimp!

723
01:17:57,717 --> 01:17:59,550
And he plays the flute!

724
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,508
No... nothing.

725
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:03,467
Anyway, he's wrecked her.

726
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:05,967
She was such a nice, funny girl!

727
01:18:06,175 --> 01:18:08,467
I saw her recently. She's changed!

728
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,633
Tough, distant.

729
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:12,425
And those horrible overalls!

730
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:13,967
Overalls?

731
01:18:15,092 --> 01:18:16,633
Come on, hurry up!

732
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:18,550
You're on in ten minutes!

733
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:22,425
Will you wait for me?

734
01:18:22,675 --> 01:18:25,883
Yes, but first tell me
where you saw her!

735
01:18:26,425 --> 01:18:27,675
After the show.

736
01:18:29,091 --> 01:18:30,508
Where did you see her?

737
01:18:30,758 --> 01:18:32,383
In the metro, at Balard Station.

738
01:18:32,633 --> 01:18:34,300
She was going to work.

739
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,175
That's what she said!

740
01:20:23,673 --> 01:20:25,173
Excuse me...

741
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:27,423
do you know this girl?

742
01:20:29,173 --> 01:20:30,423
Let me see.

743
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:33,714
I don't know her.

744
01:20:33,964 --> 01:20:35,006
You know her?

745
01:20:35,589 --> 01:20:38,298
She's not the type
to work in a factory!

746
01:20:38,548 --> 01:20:40,339
What's she got on her face?

747
01:20:42,048 --> 01:20:44,964
Sure... glycerine
mixed with nitrate...

748
01:20:45,214 --> 01:20:47,464
and sulphur!
It's great for the skin!

749
01:20:48,506 --> 01:20:50,006
Are you sure she works here?

750
01:20:50,256 --> 01:20:51,964
I was told she was here...

751
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,381
Yes... hustling!

752
01:20:56,631 --> 01:20:58,089
Well, that's possible.

753
01:20:58,756 --> 01:21:01,089
Are you engaged to her?

754
01:21:01,297 --> 01:21:02,756
No... not yet!

755
01:21:03,256 --> 01:21:04,506
I'd like to know what she does.

756
01:21:04,756 --> 01:21:08,380
The gentleman is looking for this girl.

757
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,755
He's been asking if we know her.

758
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:12,755
Yes, it's Françoise!

759
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:16,339
The new girl.
She works in the detonator section.

760
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,005
Isn't her name Cathy?

761
01:21:18,255 --> 01:21:19,839
No... it's Françoise!

762
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,047
We ate together a couple of times.

763
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:25,839
This girl works with her.

764
01:21:26,088 --> 01:21:27,463
Look at little Françoise!

765
01:21:40,172 --> 01:21:42,380
No, it's not Françoise.

766
01:21:46,422 --> 01:21:48,755
The photo was his!

767
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,463
Really?

768
01:21:53,005 --> 01:21:54,755
I thought it was a joke.

769
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:56,505
I'm sorry.

770
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,005
Never mind, I've got the negative.

771
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,755
Anyway, it's not Françoise.

772
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,213
I don't doubt it.

773
01:23:33,628 --> 01:23:34,753
6 minutes.

774
01:23:40,878 --> 01:23:42,170
10 minutes.

775
01:23:47,378 --> 01:23:48,961
15 minutes.

776
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,211
25 minutes.

777
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:12,668
Report these gentlemen...

778
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:15,793
...for trespassing,
breaking and entering...

779
01:25:16,043 --> 01:25:18,001
...and wasting my time which is money!

780
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:18,918
Calm down.

781
01:25:20,168 --> 01:25:21,460
Don't be a fool.

782
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:24,418
They're taking my papers, my car...

783
01:25:24,668 --> 01:25:27,626
...my paintings...
I'm not allowed to buy or sell.

784
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:30,626
No more bars, no restaurants,
no cinemas, nothing!

785
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,418
Everything's forbidden!

786
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:35,876
They say I can't go anywhere
even to a public piss-house!

787
01:25:36,126 --> 01:25:38,918
Just because of my grandmother's
certificate!

788
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:41,126
No, you can't take this one!

789
01:25:41,376 --> 01:25:45,043
It's not merchandise!
It belongs to me!

790
01:25:46,293 --> 01:25:49,584
Well, Inspector...
you have a warrant, of course?

791
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:52,418
Here you are.

792
01:25:53,793 --> 01:25:57,042
Try to make him understand...
it's not personal!

793
01:25:57,292 --> 01:25:59,084
And I'm not doing this for fun...
it's the law.

794
01:26:01,417 --> 01:26:03,042
I'm not discussing the law!

795
01:26:03,251 --> 01:26:05,042
But it doesn't apply to me!

796
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:07,751
I refuse to pay for another man!

797
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:10,417
The Prefecture reported your case.

798
01:26:10,626 --> 01:26:13,459
But I reported the case
to the Prefecture!

799
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:15,001
It's nothing to do with me!

800
01:26:17,376 --> 01:26:19,167
That remains to be proved.

801
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,334
It's happened before...

802
01:26:21,584 --> 01:26:23,292
...a man comes forward...

803
01:26:23,584 --> 01:26:24,959
...the better to hide.

804
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:27,500
What's that?
I don't follow.

805
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,125
I was speaking in general.

806
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,042
Please come, now.

807
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:34,750
You know the law...
don't make things difficult!

808
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,375
All right.

809
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:40,875
And the girl?

810
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:43,208
Vanished! She's left her job...

811
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:45,625
...the address she gave was false.

812
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,708
No one knows anything.

813
01:26:55,917 --> 01:26:57,458
Yes. We'll leave.

814
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:22,124
When did you start writing music?

815
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:35,374
I'd forgotten.

816
01:27:42,207 --> 01:27:43,916
You play, don't you?

817
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:44,999
Just a little.

818
01:27:45,249 --> 01:27:46,374
Try that.

819
01:27:46,624 --> 01:27:47,916
What is it?

820
01:27:48,374 --> 01:27:50,707
Our friend.
It seems he composes now...

821
01:27:50,957 --> 01:27:52,499
...in the W.C.!

822
01:28:05,749 --> 01:28:07,832
What is it? A march?

823
01:28:08,207 --> 01:28:11,290
The way you play, it could be anything!

824
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:16,290
Stop that!

825
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:18,832
Have you gone mad?

826
01:28:25,582 --> 01:28:27,040
Go on.

827
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:37,998
I knew you were an idiot,
but not this much!

828
01:28:44,248 --> 01:28:48,123
If I weren't an idiot,
why would I trust <i>you?</i>

829
01:29:58,664 --> 01:30:02,580
I know where to get
a passport and a visa.

830
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,622
All you need is money!

831
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:09,247
So, first you find a buyer...

832
01:30:09,497 --> 01:30:11,247
...and when your passport's ready...

833
01:30:11,497 --> 01:30:12,830
...at the last minute...

834
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,247
...we'll sell.

835
01:30:15,663 --> 01:30:17,038
I will.

836
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:20,163
Well, yes, of course...

837
01:30:20,413 --> 01:30:21,913
...you will sell.

838
01:30:26,372 --> 01:30:28,955
All this... how much is it worth?

839
01:30:29,205 --> 01:30:30,955
About ten million.

840
01:30:33,705 --> 01:30:36,496
Would you settle for...

841
01:30:36,746 --> 01:30:38,246
...seven or eight?

842
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,246
Leave it.

843
01:30:46,538 --> 01:30:48,579
Leave it to me.

844
01:30:49,163 --> 01:30:51,371
What are you thinking?

845
01:30:53,496 --> 01:30:54,746
Nothing.

846
01:30:57,288 --> 01:31:00,121
Anyway, I'm not selling
and I'm not going.

847
01:31:31,037 --> 01:31:31,787
Is he yours?

848
01:31:32,037 --> 01:31:34,204
No, I found him here
this morning...

849
01:31:34,454 --> 01:31:35,537
wandering around.

850
01:31:35,787 --> 01:31:37,912
Must be lost, he's starving.

851
01:31:38,162 --> 01:31:39,829
Why don't you take him?

852
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:40,787
Don't you like dogs?

853
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:42,579
Yes... other people's dogs.

854
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:44,120
See you tomorrow.

855
01:31:55,453 --> 01:31:57,120
Call the dog!
He's following me!

856
01:31:58,287 --> 01:32:00,495
I don't know his name.

857
01:32:15,078 --> 01:32:16,953
Go on, get out!

858
01:33:04,244 --> 01:33:05,619
It's incredible!

859
01:33:05,869 --> 01:33:07,369
It looks like the same dog!

860
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:09,452
Absolutely the same!

861
01:33:11,661 --> 01:33:14,452
He was outside all alone...

862
01:33:15,327 --> 01:33:17,244
...wandering all night long.

863
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,535
No one could abandon
such a nice dog, could they?

864
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:28,160
Come on.

865
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:30,785
Let's see if there's anything to eat.

866
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:31,368
Robert, listen... I'm going.

867
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:35,409
Where?

868
01:34:37,284 --> 01:34:38,701
Have some coffee.

869
01:34:38,951 --> 01:34:40,326
Sit down...

870
01:34:59,492 --> 01:35:01,784
Pierre is right, you know!

871
01:35:02,409 --> 01:35:06,492
Three articles today...
on the front page alone!

872
01:35:11,242 --> 01:35:14,075
Apart from the usual cartoons.

873
01:35:23,908 --> 01:35:26,033
This one's pretty funny.

874
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,950
Don't you like it?

875
01:35:34,325 --> 01:35:36,408
Well, perhaps a bit coarse...

876
01:35:36,908 --> 01:35:38,867
...but Pierre is right.

877
01:35:39,617 --> 01:35:43,200
They're getting the public
ready for something.

878
01:35:44,658 --> 01:35:46,241
It's obvious.

879
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:50,866
Let's see the ads.

880
01:35:51,116 --> 01:35:52,866
Lost and Found.

881
01:35:56,533 --> 01:35:59,616
No, nothing about the dog.

882
01:36:08,741 --> 01:36:09,866
Shut up.

883
01:36:50,949 --> 01:36:52,990
I read about it in the paper.

884
01:36:54,532 --> 01:36:56,032
Did they all die?

885
01:36:56,282 --> 01:36:58,532
Yes, all five of them!

886
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:08,157
There was enough T.N.T.
In the sidecars to blow up half Paris...

887
01:37:14,657 --> 01:37:18,073
...not just the Gestapo Headquarters!

888
01:37:24,906 --> 01:37:28,115
Poor devils, they didn't have much luck.

889
01:37:43,656 --> 01:37:45,906
You should leave now...

890
01:37:46,614 --> 01:37:49,114
The guard must've finished his meal.

891
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:52,739
I'll show you out.

892
01:37:54,156 --> 01:37:56,281
Was he a relative?

893
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:58,239
A friend?

894
01:38:00,406 --> 01:38:01,948
Don't worry...

895
01:38:02,656 --> 01:38:05,823
I'd do the same
if I was a bit younger...

896
01:38:06,114 --> 01:38:07,864
...or braver!

897
01:38:50,738 --> 01:38:51,947
You have the papers?

898
01:38:52,197 --> 01:38:54,280
It's been difficult.

899
01:38:54,613 --> 01:38:57,155
Here's your passport.

900
01:38:59,697 --> 01:39:01,780
De Guigny... an aristocrat?

901
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:03,572
Probably.

902
01:39:04,488 --> 01:39:06,238
That's the end of the Robert Kleins!

903
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:08,322
One blown up, and the other...

904
01:39:08,571 --> 01:39:10,613
Here's your ticket to Marseilles...

905
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:13,530
...and for the ship. It sails in two days.

906
01:39:17,613 --> 01:39:18,780
The money?

907
01:39:19,821 --> 01:39:22,821
Here... but at the last minute,
there was...

908
01:39:23,696 --> 01:39:24,696
How much?

909
01:39:24,988 --> 01:39:27,113
How much... <i>less?</i>

910
01:39:27,363 --> 01:39:28,738
Half a million...

911
01:39:28,988 --> 01:39:30,113
Let me explain.

912
01:39:30,363 --> 01:39:32,821
The buyer argued again about the gold.

913
01:39:33,071 --> 01:39:35,613
In francs, he woulďve paid
twice as much.

914
01:39:35,863 --> 01:39:37,988
It doesn't matter,
half a million, well...

915
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:40,904
...it's quite reasonable... correct.

916
01:39:41,154 --> 01:39:42,154
Or almost!

917
01:39:42,404 --> 01:39:43,363
You don't think...

918
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:46,113
No, of course not!

919
01:39:47,321 --> 01:39:48,279
Should I count it?

920
01:39:48,529 --> 01:39:49,571
Yes, I want you to.

921
01:39:49,821 --> 01:39:51,862
I'll deny you that pleasure.

922
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:54,571
There you are...

923
01:39:55,237 --> 01:39:56,987
Remember your promise.

924
01:39:57,321 --> 01:39:59,654
Don't worry, I've always wanted a dog.

925
01:39:59,904 --> 01:40:01,404
He isn't just <i>any</i> dog.

926
01:40:01,654 --> 01:40:03,112
You can trust me.

927
01:40:05,362 --> 01:40:07,029
Well... goodbye.

928
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:14,862
Good luck, Robert.

929
01:40:15,112 --> 01:40:16,529
Good luck to you!

930
01:40:16,779 --> 01:40:19,695
I was getting fed up with France.

931
01:40:19,945 --> 01:40:23,612
We're too civilized...
too well-mannered...

932
01:40:23,862 --> 01:40:25,779
...too processed!

933
01:40:26,112 --> 01:40:27,570
Cheer up!

934
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:30,362
You have half a million...

935
01:40:30,612 --> 01:40:32,112
...a fine dog...

936
01:40:32,362 --> 01:40:34,403
...and above all Nicole!

937
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:11,320
Nicole told me...

938
01:41:11,695 --> 01:41:12,986
When will you be back?

939
01:41:13,236 --> 01:41:14,278
I don't know.

940
01:41:14,528 --> 01:41:15,486
Soon?

941
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:16,944
I don't know.

942
01:41:18,194 --> 01:41:19,236
After the war?

943
01:41:19,486 --> 01:41:21,069
Maybe... I don't know.

944
01:41:21,319 --> 01:41:23,319
What about me?

945
01:41:23,694 --> 01:41:25,736
I really don't know!

946
01:41:30,986 --> 01:41:33,028
The dog... I left him with Pierre.

947
01:41:33,278 --> 01:41:36,111
I don't trust him. Look after the dog!

948
01:42:55,818 --> 01:42:58,359
See? You've got the wrong person!

949
01:42:59,776 --> 01:43:00,401
Have I?

950
01:43:01,276 --> 01:43:05,443
No, you're wrong not to trust me.

951
01:43:10,193 --> 01:43:13,276
You don't know it,
but we're friends in a way...

952
01:43:14,651 --> 01:43:16,651
We have an old friend in common!

953
01:43:25,692 --> 01:43:27,026
You know Robert?

954
01:43:27,276 --> 01:43:30,484
Klein, 32, rue des Abbesses, first floor.

955
01:43:31,067 --> 01:43:32,609
Poor Robert...

956
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:37,901
...we've left him all alone...

957
01:43:38,442 --> 01:43:42,067
...with his ghastly lovesick concierge!

958
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:45,234
His kangaroo, he called her!

959
01:43:50,525 --> 01:43:52,650
No, you're not a friend of Robert's.

960
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,609
You saw him at the station.

961
01:43:54,859 --> 01:43:56,900
You didn't even say hello!

962
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:01,067
You're quite right...

963
01:44:01,733 --> 01:44:04,483
I'm not his friend and he's not mine.

964
01:44:11,067 --> 01:44:12,358
Excuse me...

965
01:44:59,108 --> 01:45:00,358
What is it?

966
01:45:00,608 --> 01:45:02,691
Open up it's me, Robert.

967
01:45:08,899 --> 01:45:10,024
Hurry up!

968
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:17,399
What happened?

969
01:45:17,649 --> 01:45:18,274
Nothing...

970
01:45:18,566 --> 01:45:20,274
May I use the phone?

971
01:45:29,232 --> 01:45:31,024
Go back to bed.

972
01:45:33,774 --> 01:45:35,649
What about your ship?

973
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,649
Maybe I don't need to go now.

974
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:41,315
I don't get it...
Who are you calling?

975
01:45:42,607 --> 01:45:43,440
Mr Klein!

976
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:45,690
Again? Isn't he dead?

977
01:45:47,148 --> 01:45:49,065
So you found his number?

978
01:45:49,732 --> 01:45:51,315
It's the same.

979
01:45:52,732 --> 01:45:54,273
He never left.

980
01:45:54,523 --> 01:45:57,940
He put up a "To Let" sign,
gave my card to the concierge.

981
01:45:58,190 --> 01:46:00,357
And he came home every night!

982
01:46:11,731 --> 01:46:13,106
<i>Who's calling?</i>

983
01:46:21,023 --> 01:46:24,440
<i>I was looking for you too...</i>
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

984
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:27,106
Fine. When?

985
01:46:27,648 --> 01:46:28,398
<i>Whenever you like.</i>

986
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:29,606
Immediately!

987
01:46:29,856 --> 01:46:31,314
<i>All right. Where?</i>

988
01:46:31,564 --> 01:46:33,814
At your place in half an hour.

989
01:46:34,064 --> 01:46:35,064
<i>You know my address?</i>

990
01:46:35,314 --> 01:46:36,981
Yes, I know it.

991
01:46:37,231 --> 01:46:40,564
<i>Good. I'll come down</i>
<i>in half an hour to let you in.</i>

992
01:46:41,939 --> 01:46:44,148
You're not really going?

993
01:46:45,814 --> 01:46:47,189
That's why I came back.

994
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:49,814
What do you mean? It's ridiculous!

995
01:46:50,064 --> 01:46:51,731
Send the police!

996
01:46:52,356 --> 01:46:53,439
It's personal.

997
01:46:53,689 --> 01:46:54,689
But if you...

998
01:46:56,897 --> 01:46:59,231
I said it's personal!

999
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,604
I had to do it.

1000
01:48:50,271 --> 01:48:52,145
He's a criminal!

1001
01:48:52,395 --> 01:48:54,770
And I was afraid for you.

1002
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:12,141
Where do you think
they're taking us?

1003
01:53:13,975 --> 01:53:15,225
I don't know.

1004
01:53:17,058 --> 01:53:19,350
But there's no need to worry...

1005
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,350
...is there?

1006
01:53:23,308 --> 01:53:25,474
It's just a routine check.

1007
01:53:25,724 --> 01:53:27,308
I don't know.

1008
01:53:30,349 --> 01:53:32,433
I hear they'll give us
to the Boches...

1009
01:53:32,683 --> 01:53:34,891
...and send us to Germany.

1010
01:53:36,808 --> 01:53:38,641
But it can't be true!

1011
01:53:39,308 --> 01:53:41,891
The French police would never do that!

1012
01:53:43,474 --> 01:53:45,057
Don't you agree?

1013
01:53:45,307 --> 01:53:47,016
I know nothing. How could I know?

1014
01:53:47,266 --> 01:53:49,557
This has nothing to do with me!

1015
01:53:51,807 --> 01:53:53,224
I'm sorry.

1016
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,803
Look! All the certificates!

1017
01:58:55,469 --> 01:58:56,594
I'm coming back!

1018
01:58:56,844 --> 01:58:58,552
What're you doing?

1019
01:59:02,094 --> 01:59:03,177
I'm coming back!

1020
02:00:06,093 --> 02:00:07,801
<i>Six hundred louis.</i>

1021
02:00:08,218 --> 02:00:09,385
<i>Three hundred.</i>

1022
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:13,135
<i>You must be joking!</i>

1023
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:19,676
<i>At this price, I'd rather keep it.</i>

1024
02:00:20,343 --> 02:00:21,676
<i>As you like.</i>

1025
02:00:24,593 --> 02:00:27,551
<i>It's easy for you</i>
<i>when a man is forced to sell!</i>

1026
02:00:28,176 --> 02:00:30,384
<i>But I'm not forced to buy!</i>

1027
02:00:31,259 --> 02:00:33,759
<i>Make me a reasonable offer.</i>

1028
02:00:35,343 --> 02:00:37,051
<i>Three hundred louis.</i>

1029
02:00:40,343 --> 02:00:47,051
COURTASY OF YAFI.
JAGA BKS!!!
