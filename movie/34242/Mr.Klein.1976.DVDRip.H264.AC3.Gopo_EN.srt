ln the opinion of the undersigned,

the subject could well belong

27
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,619
to the Semitic race.

28
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,868
Her ancestry could be
either Jewish,

Armenian,

30
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:35,217
or Arab.

31
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:39,790
For now, the case must be
considered doubtful.

32
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,558
You can go.

33

How much do l owe you?

See my secretary.

that might interest you.</i>

47

<i>I don't believe we've met.</i>

48

<i>It's a work by Adriaen van Ostade,</i>

53
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,477
<i>a portrait of a gentleman.</i>

54
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:59,192
<i>It's an authentic painting,
signed and dated.</i>

55
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:03,520
<i>It appears in the catalog.</i>

56
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,770
<i>Six hundred louis.</i>

<i>At that price, I'd rather keep it.</i>

60

<i>As you wish.</i>

61
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:59,642
<i>It's easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell.</i>

62
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:02,258
<i>But I'm not forced to buy.</i>

63
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,450
<i>I'm not a collector.</i>

64

65

- "Why?"

Why do you think?

71
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,266
- Wait a minute.
- Later. Go back to bed.

72
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,356
If it were a matter of francs,

instead of gold louis...

74
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,537
lt's true that francs
are worthless abroad,

75
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,782

77

Very well.

Always.

87
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:06,389
Or perhaps his father.

88
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,500
Yes.

Wait. l'll give you a present.

and new measures set up
by the authorities, and so on.

171
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,360
l understand,

172
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:42,453
but l don't belong to your--

173
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:44,983
Yes, l understand.

174
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,148
lt's strange.

175
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:51,064
Unless someone else --

176
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:54,229
perhaps a friend of yours --

177
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,892
subscribed for you.

178
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,389
That's impossible.

179
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,590
No one would play
that sort of joke on me.

180
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:08,243
You think we make
a good subject for jokes?

181
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,556
No, l didn't mean that.

182
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:16,278
But the very idea seems so absurd.

183
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,256
Please excuse me.

184
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,838
So you no longer wish
to receive our newspaper?

185
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,183
Exactly.

186
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:29,362
l would also like to know
why you sent it to me.

187
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,534
l understand. Unfortunately,

188
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,107
we must wait until the prefecture
returns our list of subscribers.

189
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,772
Then we can check.

190
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:42,356
- The prefecture?
- Yes, the prefecture of police.

191
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:46,050
You give your lists to the police?

192
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:50,515
They're the ones who've allowed us
and advised us to publish this newspaper.

193
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:54,165
As l told you,
it's the only way we have --

194
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:57,265
Yes, l understand.

195
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,089
Where is the prefecture?

196
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:02,489
The Commission for
Jewish Affairs.

197
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:12,200
Robert Klein, did you say?

198
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,909
Yes.

199
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:26,868
Like that?

200
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,248
Address?

201
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:34,352
136 Rue du Bac.

202
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:37,145
How long have you lived there?

203
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:40,308
About seven years,
since l came to Paris.

204
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:46,418
Yes, in fact,
there is a Robert Klein.

205
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,592
But at another address.

206
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,439
Obviously a man with the same name.

207
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:53,936
May l have his address?

208
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,639
What would you say if l gave yours
to anyone who asked for it?

209
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,640
Take it away.

210
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,630
Where did you say you lived?

211
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,505
136, Rue du Bac.

212
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,070
The fact remains, someone
wrote my name on the paper. Why?

213
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,191
You understand my concern?

214
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:33,975
Perfectly.

215
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:38,516
lt's more curiosity than anxiety.
The fact someone would --

216
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,495
l'm sorry.
l'm taking up your time.

217
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:48,534
Such things can't interest
the police.

218
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,996
Luckily for me.

219
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,845
What does ""Moby Dick'' mean?
ls it a name?

220
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,189
Yes.

221
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,840
A woman's name?

222
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,952
No, a whale's.

223
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:29,338
He's exactly like me.

224
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,996
Who's that?

225
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:32,496
lshmael.

226
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:34,900
Listen to this.

227
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,074
"Sixteen hours in bed.

228
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:40,211
The small of my back ached.

229
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,184
l felt worse and worse.

230
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,950
At last, l got up

231
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,850
and threw myself at her feet,

232
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,227
beseeching her to beat me,

233
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:52,022
to do anything, indeed,

234
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:55,570
but condemn me to lie in bed

235
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:58,553
for such an unendurable
length of time."

236
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:13,428
Can l get up?

237
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:19,281
Do me a favor:
Get a different book.

238
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:23,216
The one with the pink cover.

239
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,473
Chloé.

240
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,600
From the beginning?

241
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,366
Wherever you'd like.

242
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,953
Page 47.

243
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,240
"Pale and trembling like doves,

244
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:53,030
the three maidens entered the room.

245
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:54,617
ln the dancing firelight,

246
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,050
it looked even more
imposing and fantastic..."

247
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,176
lt can't be.

248
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,319
Go on.

249
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,112
l can't.

250
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:10,936
"lmposing and fantastic.

251
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,392
That enormous penis,

252
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:17,177
tumescent,

253
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:18,900
superb,

254
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,083
alive."

255
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,355
Go on.

256
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,601
<i>I know very little about him.</i>

257
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,911
<i>I never saw much of him.</i>

258
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:03,986
The girl took care of everything.

259
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:05,881
A brunette,

260
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,540
pretty sexy.

261
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:09,847
l think she was a whore

262
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,507
or a dancer.

263
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,880
He only went out at night
when l was in bed.

264
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,804
Around midnight,
after curfew,

265
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,533
l'd hear him come down the stairs.

266
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,200
And the morning l saw him,

267
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:27,480
it was about 5:00.
l was taking out the trash.

268
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,940
There he is!

269
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:36,085
You're Mr. Klein, aren't you,
from the second floor?

270
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:38,964
No, l'm sorry.

271
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:41,268
l'm not your Mr. Klein.

272
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,184
Pardon me.

273
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:45,754
l thought you were him.

274
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:49,848
Same height, same hair,just as slim.

275
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:51,637
The same look.

276
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,521
Because l never saw
the other one's face.

277
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,370
What do you want?

278
00:23:57,787 --> 00:24:00,918
l've come about the apartment.
ls it still available?

279
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,983
- lf you don't mind waiting a minute.
- Not at all.

280
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,914
We're finished.
What about the calling card?

281
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:09,935
Yes, it's right here.

282
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,589
Wait, l'll write down
the address for his mail.

283
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:17,588
- Does he still get mail?
- Yes, but not much.

284
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,251
A newspaper, a letter.

285
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:20,751
Nothing else.

286
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,192
So you want to move in here?

287
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,568
No, it's for a friend
who's coming to Paris.

288
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,766
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

289
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:35,059
lf you hear anything, call us.

290
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,788
Yes, certainly.

291
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,403
Good-bye.

292
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,202
Do you really want
to see the apartment?

293
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,480
The wallpaper needs changing.
lt's all moldy.

294
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,960
The ceiling needs painting.

295
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:11,095
The toilet bowl's got to be changed.

296
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:15,027
And you'd have to get rid
of the rats.

297
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,561
- Rats?
- Yes, rats.

298
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,016
Look at this.

299
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,990
All over the place.

300
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:34,485
No, this is no place for you.

301
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:37,140
lf you're interested,

302
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:38,804
it's 150 francs a month.

303
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,080
Outrageous.

304
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:43,445
Plus electricity
and a maintenance fee.

305
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,835
He had a dog?

306
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:09,590
Yes, a German shepherd.

307
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,175
Sometimes he'd bark
and then whimper

308
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:16,022
as if he were being beaten.

309
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,560
My husband always said you could
judge a house by the bathroom,

310
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,227
and he was right.

311
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:50,358
Well? Haven't you seen enough?

312
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,382
- The shower?
- lt's out of order.

313
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,895
What's wrong?

314
00:27:17,978 --> 00:27:19,571
l'm sorry,

315
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:22,424
but since my husband
has been gone,

316
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,439
l get funny.

317
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,417
Every now and then,

318
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,201
l have these hallucinations.

319
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,164
ls your husband dead?

320
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:37,811
No, he's in Germany.

321
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,475
Prisoner of war.

322
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:53,395
Yes, l remember.

323
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:55,985
A pretty girl and a beautiful dog.

324
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,232
You, on the other hand,

325
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:07,891
your face was hidden.

326
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,483
But you're recognizable.

327
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,590
Do you still have that sidecar?

328
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:16,271
No, it got blown up.

329
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,600
May l?

330
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,519
Good evening.

331
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,489
Who's that skeleton in your house?

332
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:42,937
What skeleton?

333
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:43,896
That whore!

334
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,803
What do you mean?

335
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:49,456
A girl called Janine.

336
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:55,510
A friend.

337
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,945
Why did l find her here?

338
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,593
Because you got here after her.

339
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:16,368
She was alone in the house.

340
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,560
Because she got here first.

341
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:22,099
ls your husband here?

342
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,614
Yes.

343
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:31,408
And two policemen
are waiting for you.

344
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:56,118
Good evening.

345
00:30:58,426 --> 00:30:59,855
Sorry l'm late.

346
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,561
Listen.

347
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,923
They're waiting for you.

348
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:09,423
Yes, your wife told me.

349
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:12,498
- What's going on?
- Nothing. l'll explain later.

350
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,559
Good evening.

351
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,531
l have the impression
we've met before.

352
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,195
We have that same impression.

353
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:29,297
Did you rent that apartment
for your friend after all?

354
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:32,084
No, l haven't made up my mind yet.

355
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,413
We brought back your card.

356
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,075
Thank you very much.

357
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,504
l have a terrible habit
of handing them out everywhere.

358
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:44,081
- How about a drink?
- No, thank you.

359
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,942
But you go ahead.
We can wait.

360
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:49,014
Are we going somewhere?

361
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:50,511
The Pigalle police station.

362
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:53,074
Again?
l went there after l saw you.

363
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:55,480
l spoke to the inspector
just five minutes ago.

364
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,505
Pierre, please turn down
the phonograph.

365
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:03,250
Nicole, would you get me a beer?

366
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,224
Maybe you should call him.
That would save time.

367
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,447
Pigalle 30-30?

368
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,443
- Call him, François.
- May l?

369
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:24,943
Go right ahead.

370
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:38,931
You bastard.

371
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:40,890
lnspector, we're here with Mr. Klein.

372
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:47,768
Yes, sir. Very well.

373
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:54,864
Who could this other Klein be?

374
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:56,366
l have no idea.

375
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,090
l first heard about him
yesterday at the prefecture.

376
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,009
Our orders came from the prefecture.

377
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:07,093
Anyway, if you hear anything...

378
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,785
Don't worry.
lt's in my interest.

379
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:39,151
l don't like this business.

380
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:43,256
So there's a man
who's got the same name, a Jew.

381
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:46,590
He's gone off and left you
with his problem.

382
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,410
How could he know about me?

383
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:50,036
Your calling cards are all over Paris.

384
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:51,535
lt doesn't make any sense.

385
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,479
Does he expect me
to just shut up and take his place?

386
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:57,618
lt's someone with a grudge
against me

387
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,056
trying to get me into trouble,
provoke me.

388
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,240
Why should he have
a grudge against you?

389
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:05,350
And why not?

390
00:36:46,522 --> 00:36:48,344
""My love,

391
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,590
what interminable months!

392
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,566
ln two days,
it'll be ourJanuary 26th.

393
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:54,576
l'm here, waiting for you.

394
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:59,088
The train to lvry la Bataille
still leaves at 6:15.

395
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:01,071
You mustn't miss it, you know that?

396
00:37:01,146 --> 00:37:02,935
Because this time, l swear

397
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:04,976
you'd lose me.

398
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:08,115
And that would be awful,
my darling.

399
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,642
Florence."

400
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:17,650
"You mustn't miss it, you know that?

401
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,088
Because this time
it would be awful, my darling.

402
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:23,987
Florence."

403
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:44,978
Do you have any baggage?

404
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:48,160
Please follow me, sir.

405
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,357
Good evening, Mr. Klein.

406
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:00,051
Please come in.

407
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,371
They're expecting you.

408
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,639
May l take your coat?

409
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:10,422
Please.

410
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:18,223
Good evening.

411
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,536
l'm Charles-Xavier,

412
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:22,894
your host.

413
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:35,025
l know, it's a complicated story.

414
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:38,295
Come with me.

415
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,822
lt's quieter in there.

416
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,930
Yes, then l can explain.

417
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:24,535
Florence, can you imagine Robert
living in Pigalle?

418
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:26,194
ln a furnished room?

419
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:28,404
Robert in Pigalle?

420
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:30,837
ln lodgings, Rue des Abbesses.

421
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:33,905
That's impossible.
lt's absurd.

422
00:42:33,977 --> 00:42:35,766
This gentleman has the same name.

423
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,525
Really? Just like Robert?

424
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:39,186
lsn't that funny.

425
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:40,370
Please.

426
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:44,469
What was Robert doing in Pigalle?

427
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:45,944
Nothing.

428
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:47,798
l don't think he was ever there.

429
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:51,923
Then God only knows
why this letter was sent to him in Pigalle.

430
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,750
That's right.

431
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:55,411
There's a letter.

432
00:42:55,482 --> 00:42:56,911
They're waiting for us.

433
00:42:56,985 --> 00:42:59,025
Couldn't we read it after dinner?

434
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:00,526
lt's only a few lines.

435
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,985
We're all starving.

436
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:05,781
Yes, l see your point.

437
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:09,334
But if you knew Robert
as well as l do...

438
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:12,498
l can't accept your theory.

439
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:15,471
We can't be talking
about the same person.

440
00:43:15,546 --> 00:43:17,880
Let's go in to dinner.
Will you stay?

441
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:20,117
No, thank you.
l must return to Paris.

442
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:21,778
My train leaves soon.

443
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,021
l don't believe there are
any more trains tonight.

444
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:26,290
No, only on odd days.

445
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:29,030
You see?
Now you have no excuse.

446
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,769
There must be a hotel nearby.

447
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,216
Requisitioned.

448
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:34,232
Don't worry. You're my guest.

449
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:36,304
Anyhow,

450
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,409
we did invite you
in a way, didn't we?

451
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:42,328
Come on.
Now you have no more excuses.

452
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,025
No, don't move.

453
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:17,050
Don't turn on the light.

454
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,108
Don't turn on the light.

455
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:28,558
My letter.

456
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,600
Would you mind giving it back to me?

457
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:35,439
Would you mind turning around?

458
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:36,822
Why?

459
00:44:38,585 --> 00:44:40,211
Because l sleep in the nude.

460
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:05,810
Tell me.

461
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,222
Does your friend happen
to be Jewish?

462
00:45:10,297 --> 00:45:12,119
Robert? l don't think so.

463
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:16,116
As far as l know,
he's an atheist.

464
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:19,246
Yet he subscribes
to a Jewish newspaper.

465
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:22,850
That's possible.
He reads a lot.

466
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,174
And talks very little.

467
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:26,485
Who told you that?
On the contrary.

468
00:45:27,193 --> 00:45:29,103
Then what did he tell you about me?

469
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:31,573
Nothing.

470
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:33,975
He never mentioned you.

471
00:45:34,457 --> 00:45:35,766
No letter, then.

472
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,950
l know what Robert would say
if he were here.

473
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:49,649
First, he'd compare you
to an animal or an insect.

474
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:54,070
His theory is based on
what he calls

475
00:45:54,137 --> 00:45:57,366
the infinite variety
of specialized instincts.

476
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:59,855
- How fascinating!
- lsn't it?

477
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:03,060
He claims that
in animals and insects,

478
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:05,268
this variety manifests

479
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:07,246
in a series of different species.

480
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:09,460
But in man this is not possible,

481
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:11,896
since there's only one human species.

482
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:14,000
- Therefore...
- l get the point.

483
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,884
The eyes are important,

484
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:26,327
the mouth,

485
00:46:26,393 --> 00:46:27,986
the curve of the lips.

486
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,512
A feeling of being superior
to others,

487
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:33,366
a love of freedom,

488
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,222
egoism.

489
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:36,630
A bird.

490
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:37,965
Of prey.

491
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,350
A falcon.

492
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:41,523
- A vulture.
- Why?

493
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:44,140
Do l eat corpses?

494
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:48,916
You don't return letters.

495
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:53,843
How about your friend?

496
00:46:56,153 --> 00:46:57,941
What animal
did he choose for himself?

497
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:00,793
The eagle? The lion?

498
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,150
The snake.

499
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:06,803
A hibernating snake,
waiting for a better season.

500
00:47:08,857 --> 00:47:11,792
l can't understand
why he got you into this mess.

501
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:15,637
So he could hide, l think.

502
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:19,221
To disappear behind another man.

503
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:21,134
Me.

504
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,150
No, he's no coward.

505
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:25,265
He wouldn't harm anyone.

506
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:27,093
Except himself, perhaps.

507
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:30,577
Or else for revenge.
Yes, then he might.

508
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,591
But revenge for what?

509
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,640
l don't even know him.

510
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:38,137
You know what l thought
when l saw you come in?

511
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:44,450
That Robert himself had sent you.

512
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:45,357
Why?

513
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:48,564
To explain to me
why he hadn't come,

514
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,350
to see how l'd react,
to provoke me,

515
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:53,815
to humiliate me.

516
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:55,158
l don't understand.

517
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:57,134
Yes, as if to tell me,

518
00:47:57,209 --> 00:48:01,300
"l'm sending another man in my place,
but it will be all the same to you."

519
00:48:01,626 --> 00:48:05,138
Yes, he's capable of that.

520
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:09,231
That seems a little excessive,
don't you think?

521
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:12,090
He's quite capable of that.

522
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:18,581
What if it were true?

523
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:22,030
Suppose that's why l came.

524
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:25,110
He loves that sort of situation.

525
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:28,022
So do l.

526
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:30,300
What about you?

527
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,759
Even if it's really untrue?

528
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,262
Especially.

529
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:37,457
Or let's suppose...

530
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:42,484
lt's very late. l must go.

531
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:46,292
My husband must be looking
for me.

532
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:38,481
We forgot to say good night.

533
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,576
l can't sleep when that happens.

534
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,958
l see you have the same problem.

535
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,430
Do you realize
l could go to the police?

536
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:11,214
Then you must talk.

537
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:13,842
Where is he?

538
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:16,976
l swear l don't know.

539
00:51:18,265 --> 00:51:20,272
Let's start at the beginning.

540
00:51:21,017 --> 00:51:23,121
Where did he live before Pigalle?

541
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:26,798
ln a hotel on the Rue de l'Université.

542
00:51:28,345 --> 00:51:30,483
When did you learn about Pigalle?

543
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,884
Two months ago.

544
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:36,100
Through a messenger boy

545
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:38,867
who brought me
his flute and a note.

546
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,415
What did the note say?

547
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:44,621
Nothing.

548
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,576
Jokes, as usual.

549
00:51:48,217 --> 00:51:50,159
He said he was going
into hibernation,

550
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:54,007
and l was to keep his flute
until a better season.

551
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,009
Where did he go into hibernation?

552
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:01,076
l don't know.

553
00:52:01,145 --> 00:52:03,530
He didn't say.

554
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:05,011
Very well.

555
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:07,765
The police will find out.

556
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,112
And you, your husband
and every member of your musical zoo

557
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:14,354
will be called in for questioning.

558
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:19,062
Please don't do that.

559
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,452
l'm sorry, Florence.

560
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:25,139
But one way or another,
l must find out

561
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:27,064
what this man wants from me.

562
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:30,773
Good-bye.

563
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:39,062
lt's a shame about last night.

564
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,258
Just a moment.

565
00:52:43,865 --> 00:52:45,294
All right.

566
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:50,581
But first, you must swear
you won't go to the police.

567
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,830
l swear.

568
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,535
136, Rue du Bac.

569
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:03,956
You have the present?

570
00:55:04,025 --> 00:55:06,065
l didn't sleep all night.

571
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,450
Neither did l.
Have you got it?

572
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:10,321
You could have told me.
Some people came looking for you.

573
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:11,603
What did they want?

574
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,101
l don't know.

575
00:55:39,448 --> 00:55:41,400
Pierre.

576
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:45,350
ls it serious?

577
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,495
Tell me, are the Kleins
full-blooded French,

578
00:55:57,561 --> 00:55:59,950
or are there Jews in
your family?

579
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:07,810
lndifference

580
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,639
is like a still, flat sea

581
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,785
surrounding a drowning man.

582
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,462
lt's like a flock of sheep

583
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:19,984
grazing in the ruins of a village.

584
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:22,830
Or like a worm

585
00:56:22,904 --> 00:56:26,516
crawling over a putrid wound.

586
00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:33,521
A man can be stingy, selfish,
hypocritical, anything.

587
00:56:33,593 --> 00:56:38,099
as long as he's aware.

588
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:41,554
The result is the same.

589
00:56:42,553 --> 00:56:44,375
No, not exactly.

590
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,921
- Have you ever heard of remorse?
- Yes.

591
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:51,406
lt's like a vulture

592
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:54,320
pierced by an arrow,

593
00:56:53,784 --> 00:56:55,540
yet it continues to fly.

594
00:56:55,608 --> 00:56:57,616
Oh, it's you!

595
00:56:58,553 --> 00:57:00,309
What's the matter?

596
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:04,206
- Why have you come?
- To see you.

597
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,647
Yes, of course.
But what else?

598
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:08,535
Nostalgia...

599
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:11,091
for my roots.

600
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:15,472
l want the birth certificates
of my grandparents

601
00:57:15,545 --> 00:57:17,138
on both sides.

602
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:20,050
And mine too, naturally.

603
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,280
Why?

604
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:23,821
l told you.

605
00:57:24,088 --> 00:57:27,210
Nostalgia, curiosity.

606
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:38,931
Don't be an idiot, Robert.
Tell me why.

607
00:57:40,568 --> 00:57:42,161
lt's nothing.

608
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:46,197
A formality, a routine check.

609
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,973
These days, the Paris police

610
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,080
want to prove they exist.

611
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:57,302
So a slight misunderstanding
must be cleared up.

612
00:57:57,944 --> 00:58:00,311
What kind of misunderstanding?

613
00:58:01,176 --> 00:58:02,605
About my identity.

614
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,102
What's that got to do
with your grandparents?

615
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:07,281
Your own certificate
should be enough,

616
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:09,774
or mine and your mother's
at the very most.

617
00:58:09,848 --> 00:58:12,401
They want my grandparents' too
to be sure.

618
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:15,762
Sure of what?

619
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:17,621
My origins.

620
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:21,878
Well, yes.

621
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:24,977
l must prove l'm not a certain man
the police are looking for.

622
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,400
How long have they given you?

623
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:52,952
Two weeks.

624
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:55,506
That's quite enough.

625
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:00,270
lt all sounds very strange.

626
00:59:01,528 --> 00:59:03,895
Are you sure there isn't
something more behind it?

627
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:06,578
lt's just a formality.

628
00:59:06,649 --> 00:59:08,504
There's no real doubt.

629
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:11,383
So why do they want
the certificates?

630
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:15,504
Because it's the law.

631
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,118
And also...

632
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:26,310
because there's another Robert Klein.

633
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,622
And apparently he's a Jew.

634
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:31,309
A Jew?

635
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,251
lmpossible!

636
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:40,080
Or it could be the Dutch branch.

637
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,548
Are there Kleins in Holland?

638
00:59:42,617 --> 00:59:45,250
Quite a different breed.

639
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,638
- But we're related.
- l tell you,

640
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,277
we've been French and Catholic
since Louis XlV!

641
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,326
Yes, miss.

642
01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:08,174
Hello. Yes.

643
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:09,328
What?

644
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,513
No, l'm all right.

645
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:13,334
Three of the certificates
are here in Strasbourg.

646
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:16,565
But as for my maternal
grandparents,

647
01:00:16,633 --> 01:00:19,153
one of them was born
in Marseilles.

648
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,850
Jules Marcel Bleard.

649
01:00:23,512 --> 01:00:26,479
Yes, B-L-E-A-R-D. You got it?

650
01:00:26,552 --> 01:00:28,374
And my grandmother in Algiers.

651
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:31,536
Yeah, Algeria.

652
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,478
- No, she wasn't an Arab.
- lmbecile!

653
01:00:34,552 --> 01:00:36,974
Her father was a Communard
who was deported to Algeria.

654
01:00:37,624 --> 01:00:41,301
Okay. Send someone to Algiers
and Marseilles right away.

655
01:00:46,328 --> 01:00:47,921
See you tomorrow.

656
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,337
That was my lawyer.

657
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,590
So do you know
any of those Kleins from Holland?

658
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:04,130
l've heard about them.

659
01:01:05,272 --> 01:01:07,639
And this other Robert Klein?

660
01:01:11,449 --> 01:01:12,594
Never.

661
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:56,677
Thank you.

662
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:08,844
And now l'm going to do

663
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,813
what they ought to do!

664
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:17,416
l will leave...

665
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:21,537
before you throw me out...

666
01:05:25,676 --> 01:05:27,334
with a kick in the ass!

667
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,973
Please, let's go.

668
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:04,229
<i>Mr. Klein!</i>

669
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,818
Maybe it's not for me.

670
01:07:19,884 --> 01:07:21,826
He could be hiding in the crowd.

671
01:07:24,652 --> 01:07:26,081
You think l'm crazy?

672
01:07:30,572 --> 01:07:32,394
What were you saying?

673
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:35,687
l sent my assistant to lvry.

674
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:38,342
The house is closed.
The owners left for Mexico.

675
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,514
Are they Jews as well?

676
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:44,001
Probably.

677
01:07:45,388 --> 01:07:49,316
Look, you can play at being
a detective, chasing ghosts,

678
01:07:49,388 --> 01:07:50,981
but at least do what l say.

679
01:07:52,812 --> 01:07:54,372
We can't go on waiting like fools

680
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:56,681
for papers that may never come.

681
01:07:56,748 --> 01:07:58,024
Let's try to get a --

682
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:01,063
l told you. l'm not a horse.

683
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:03,782
l won't have my nose or ears
or anything else measured.

684
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:05,761
l detest veterinarians.

685
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:08,779
l'll wait for the papers from Algiers.

686
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:10,666
How can a man as distrustful
as you

687
01:08:10,731 --> 01:08:13,317
suddenly show such boundless
confidence in the post office,

688
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:15,592
the railways, the bureaucracy,
and even the police!

689
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,602
Because l'm a good Frenchman.

690
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,683
l believe in our institutions,

691
01:08:19,756 --> 01:08:20,868
including the phone system.

692
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,029
Was there a call for me?

693
01:08:29,694 --> 01:08:30,955
No, no one called.

694
01:08:40,012 --> 01:08:41,288
l'm Mr. Klein.

695
01:08:41,356 --> 01:08:43,265
There's someone
asking for you on the phone...

696
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,195
l mean, at the bar.

697
01:08:51,596 --> 01:08:53,506
Well, he was here.

698
01:08:54,316 --> 01:08:56,455
He must have left.
That's strange.

699
01:08:56,524 --> 01:08:57,985
What did he look like?

700
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:01,475
Tall with dark hair.
Pretty much like you.

701
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:05,346
Do you really think this man --

702
01:09:11,403 --> 01:09:13,825
You can't!
The curfew's in 30 minutes.

703
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,492
- Then l'll spend the night.
- Where?

704
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:16,873
l'll rent the place.

705
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,274
- Why not?
- Well, first l have to see

706
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:20,768
the administrator.

707
01:09:20,844 --> 01:09:23,080
l'll see him tomorrow.

708
01:09:29,594 --> 01:09:30,725
Here's the deposit.

709
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:32,868
No, l'm not allowed to --

710
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:34,630
- Even if it's for you?
- For me?

711
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,488
- For your trouble.
- l don't want it.

712
01:09:37,483 --> 01:09:39,720
You don't really mean
to sleep here, do you?

713
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:40,770
Why not?

714
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:44,073
The police told me
not to let anyone in.

715
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:45,034
And if they check...

716
01:09:45,694 --> 01:09:46,726
l just want to have a look.

717
01:09:46,796 --> 01:09:48,072
But you've already seen it.

718
01:09:48,544 --> 01:09:49,732
l must see it again to decide.

719
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,961
Did you hear
from that man Klein?

720
01:09:55,596 --> 01:09:57,286
What about the girl?

721
01:09:57,356 --> 01:09:58,632
What's her name again?

722
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,903
lsabelle.

723
01:10:00,971 --> 01:10:03,240
lsabelle. And her last name?

724
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:07,045
l never knew it.

725
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,308
<i>Is that you, Robert?</i>

726
01:12:08,716 --> 01:12:10,308
<i>I'm across the street.</i>

727
01:12:10,379 --> 01:12:11,972
<i>I saw you at the window.</i>

728
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,082
<i>Did something happen?</i>

729
01:12:23,532 --> 01:12:25,354
<i>Then why?</i>

730
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,608
Why what?

731
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,456
Someone keeps calling all the time.
Who was that?

732
01:13:01,355 --> 01:13:02,882
l don't know.

733
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:04,901
lt was a woman's voice.

734
01:13:04,972 --> 01:13:07,208
Did you give her
Mr. Klein's new number?

735
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:09,764
How stupid of me.

736
01:13:10,443 --> 01:13:12,647
How could you know that?

737
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:41,092
There aren't any lsabelles here.

738
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:54,978
What is it, Gerard?

739
01:13:55,052 --> 01:13:56,645
This man's looking for a girl.

740
01:13:58,827 --> 01:13:59,940
Here l am.

741
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,921
Her name is lsabelle.

742
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:05,672
Too bad.

743
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:11,360
l don't know her.

744
01:14:11,435 --> 01:14:13,290
There's no one here named lsabelle.

745
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:19,304
That's not lsabelle. lt's Cathy.

746
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,447
She doesn't work here anymore.

747
01:14:21,515 --> 01:14:24,003
She left a month or two ago,

748
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:25,504
maybe even three.

749
01:14:25,579 --> 01:14:27,874
Do you know where she lives?

750
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:28,836
With him, l think.

751
01:14:28,908 --> 01:14:30,674
God knows where.

752
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,649
Do you know him?

753
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:35,495
l saw him a couple of times
when he'd come for her.

754
01:14:37,484 --> 01:14:38,466
Why?

755
01:14:39,314 --> 01:14:40,709
He's no good.

756
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,885
A Corsican or an Arab.

757
01:14:43,948 --> 01:14:45,703
Something like that.

758
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:48,489
A gangster, you know, or a pimp.

759
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:52,504
And he plays the flute.

760
01:14:52,203 --> 01:14:53,632
No, nothing.

761
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,562
ln any case, he ruined her.

762
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:57,929
She was such a nice, funny girl.

763
01:14:57,995 --> 01:14:59,425
l saw her recently.

764
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:02,020
She's changed. Tough, distant.

765
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:05,220
- And those horrible overalls.
- Overalls?

766
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:07,876
Come on, hurry up!

767
01:15:07,948 --> 01:15:09,922
You're on in 10 minutes!

768
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,055
- Will you wait for me?
- Yes.

769
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:16,801
But first tell me where
you saw her.

770
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:19,623
After the show.

771
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,449
Where did you see her?

772
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:23,370
ln the metro, at the Balard station.

773
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,093
She was going to work.

774
01:15:25,784 --> 01:15:26,756
Or so she said.

775
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:11,719
Excuse me, miss.

776
01:17:11,787 --> 01:17:13,380
Do you know this girl?

777
01:17:15,723 --> 01:17:17,674
Let me see.

778
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:21,220
l don't know her.
You know her?

779
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:24,194
She's not the type
to work in a factory.

780
01:17:24,267 --> 01:17:25,958
What's she got on her face?

781
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:27,874
Foundation cream.

782
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,836
- Do you use it?
- Sure.

783
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:31,594
Glycerin mixed with nitrate
and a little sulfur.

784
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:32,902
lt's great for the skin.

785
01:17:34,704 --> 01:17:35,584
Are you sure she works here?

786
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:37,415
l was told she was here.

787
01:17:38,795 --> 01:17:40,802
Yes, hustling.

788
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:43,297
Well, that's possible.

789
01:17:43,947 --> 01:17:46,500
ls she your fiancée, by any chance?

790
01:17:46,571 --> 01:17:48,065
No, not yet.

791
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:49,797
l'd like to know what she does.

792
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:53,609
Listen, the gentleman
is looking for this girl.

793
01:17:53,675 --> 01:17:55,617
He's been asking if we know her.

794
01:17:55,691 --> 01:17:57,513
Yes, that's Françoise.

795
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:01,060
She's the new girl.
She works in the detonator section.

796
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:02,724
lsn't her name Cathy?

797
01:18:02,795 --> 01:18:04,388
No, it's Françoise.

798
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:06,368
We had lunch together
a couple of times.

799
01:18:07,499 --> 01:18:08,448
Michelle!

800
01:18:08,523 --> 01:18:10,017
That girl works with her.

801
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:11,585
Look at little Françoise.

802
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:25,834
No, that's not Françoise.

803
01:18:29,547 --> 01:18:32,484
Michelle, that was his picture.

804
01:18:34,411 --> 01:18:36,005
Really?

805
01:18:36,075 --> 01:18:38,083
l thought it was a joke.

806
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:39,781
l'm sorry.

807
01:18:41,003 --> 01:18:42,825
Never mind. l've got the negative.

808
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:44,866
ln any case, it's not Françoise.

809
01:18:47,915 --> 01:18:49,508
l don't doubt it.

810
01:20:07,627 --> 01:20:10,304
St. Lazare, Madeleine:

811
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:13,888
six minutes.

812
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,829
Etoile, Alma:

813
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:21,394
ten minutes.

814
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:24,996
République, Châtelet:

815
01:20:26,028 --> 01:20:27,653
fifteen minutes.

816
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:31,817
<i>Bastille, Montparnasse:</i>

817
01:20:34,283 --> 01:20:35,843
<i>Twenty-five minutes.</i>

818
01:21:40,523 --> 01:21:42,345
Put that with the rest.

819
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:44,615
Hello, lnspector.

820
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:50,087
Report these gentlemen for trespassing
and breaking and entering.

821
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:52,673
And for wasting my time,
which is money!

822
01:21:52,747 --> 01:21:53,695
Calm down.

823
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:57,225
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Me?

824
01:21:57,291 --> 01:22:00,225
They're taking my papers,
my car, my paintings.

825
01:22:00,299 --> 01:22:02,694
l'm not allowed to buy or sell.

826
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:04,903
No more bars, restaurants,
movie theaters, nothing.

827
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,564
Everything's forbidden.

828
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:10,304
They say l can't go anywhere,
not even to a public restroom.

829
01:22:11,024 --> 01:22:13,089
Just because my grandmother's
certificate hasn't arrived yet!

830
01:22:13,784 --> 01:22:15,912
No, you can't take that one!
lt's not for sale.

831
01:22:16,555 --> 01:22:19,234
This isn't a piece of merchandise.
lt belongs to me.

832
01:22:19,755 --> 01:22:22,755
lnspector, you do have
a warrant, of course?

833
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,311
Here you are.

834
01:22:26,987 --> 01:22:30,566
Try to make him understand
it's not personal.

835
01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:32,260
l'm not doing this for fun.

836
01:22:32,331 --> 01:22:33,924
lt's the law.

837
01:22:34,571 --> 01:22:36,229
l'm not questioning the law.

838
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:38,306
lt doesn't concern me.

839
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:40,451
l refuse to pay for another man!

840
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:43,338
The prefecture reported your case.

841
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:46,054
But l'm the one who reported
the case to the prefecture!

842
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:47,530
This has nothing to do with me!

843
01:22:49,515 --> 01:22:51,654
That remains to be proved.

844
01:22:51,723 --> 01:22:55,498
lt wouldn't be the first time
that a man came forward,

845
01:22:55,563 --> 01:22:57,537
the better to hide.

846
01:22:57,611 --> 01:23:00,464
What's that? l don't follow.

847
01:23:00,203 --> 01:23:02,374
l was speaking in general.

848
01:23:02,443 --> 01:23:04,036
Please come now.

849
01:23:04,224 --> 01:23:06,474
You know the law.
Don't make things difficult.

850
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:08,474
All right.

851
01:23:09,195 --> 01:23:10,504
Pierre.

852
01:23:11,306 --> 01:23:13,445
- And the girl?
- She's vanished.

853
01:23:13,515 --> 01:23:16,864
She hasn't shown up for work,
and the address she gave them was false.

854
01:23:16,939 --> 01:23:19,044
Nobody knows anything about her.

855
01:23:26,603 --> 01:23:28,196
Yes. We'll leave.

856
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,025
<i>That's about all of it.</i>

857
01:23:48,843 --> 01:23:51,657
When did you start writing music?

858
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,724
lnvestigate all this.

859
01:24:03,787 --> 01:24:05,609
l'd forgotten.

860
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:12,676
You play, don't you?

861
01:24:12,746 --> 01:24:15,514
-Just a little.
- Give it a try.

862
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:16,869
What is it?

863
01:24:16,938 --> 01:24:19,393
lt's our friend's.
lt seems he composes now,

864
01:24:19,467 --> 01:24:22,054
in the bathroom.

865
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:35,975
What is it, a military march?

866
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:38,693
The way you play,
it could be anything.

867
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:44,000
Stop that!

868
01:24:44,363 --> 01:24:46,273
Have you gone crazy?

869
01:24:52,779 --> 01:24:54,023
Go on.

870
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:04,418
l knew you were stupid
but not that stupid!

871
01:25:10,602 --> 01:25:14,344
lf l weren't an idiot,
how could l trust you?

872
01:26:22,027 --> 01:26:26,020
l know where to get
a passport and a visa.

873
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:27,683
All it takes is money.

874
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:31,777
So first you find a buyer,

875
01:26:32,427 --> 01:26:34,499
and when your passport's ready,

876
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,879
and at the last moment,

877
01:26:35,947 --> 01:26:37,223
we'll sell.

878
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:40,227
l'll sell.

879
01:26:40,843 --> 01:26:43,274
Well, yes, of course.

880
01:26:43,934 --> 01:26:44,608
You'll sell.

881
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:51,366
And how much is all of this worth?

882
01:26:51,435 --> 01:26:53,290
About 10 million.

883
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,310
Would you settle

884
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:00,260
for seven or eight?

885
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:07,944
Forget it.

886
01:27:08,011 --> 01:27:09,953
Leave that to me.

887
01:27:10,795 --> 01:27:12,900
What are you thinking?

888
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:15,976
Nothing.

889
01:27:18,282 --> 01:27:21,065
ln any case, l'm not selling,
and l'm not leaving.

890
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:48,419
Morning, Georges.

891
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,226
- ls he yours?
- No.

892
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:55,200
l found him wandering
around here this morning.

893
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:57,478
He must be lost.
He's starving.

894
01:27:57,546 --> 01:27:59,302
Why don't you take him?

895
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:02,088
- Don't you like dogs?
- Yes. Other people's dogs.

896
01:28:02,704 --> 01:28:04,642
- See you tomorrow.
- Good-bye.

897
01:28:14,027 --> 01:28:15,969
Georges, call the dog.
He's following me.

898
01:28:16,907 --> 01:28:19,584
l don't know his name.

899
01:28:33,034 --> 01:28:35,010
Go on. Go away!

900
01:29:20,544 --> 01:29:21,600
This is incredible.

901
01:29:21,674 --> 01:29:23,496
lt looks like the same dog.

902
01:29:23,563 --> 01:29:25,714
Absolutely identical.

903
01:29:27,274 --> 01:29:29,576
He was all alone outside,

904
01:29:31,018 --> 01:29:32,611
wandering around all night long.

905
01:29:33,642 --> 01:29:36,937
No one could abandon
such a beautiful dog, could they?

906
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,527
Come on.

907
01:29:43,594 --> 01:29:45,383
Let's see if there's
anything to eat.

908
01:30:37,578 --> 01:30:39,544
Excuse me.

909
01:30:39,786 --> 01:30:42,339
Robert, listen.

910
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,784
l'm going.

911
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:47,586
Where?

912
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:50,787
Have some coffee.

913
01:30:50,858 --> 01:30:52,451
Sit down.

914
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:12,357
Pierre is right, you know.

915
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:16,746
Three articles today,
just on the front page.

916
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:24,194
Apart from the usual cartoons.

917
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:34,664
Look.

918
01:31:34,219 --> 01:31:36,007
This one's pretty funny.

919
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,253
Don't you like it?

920
01:31:41,674 --> 01:31:42,852
Well,

921
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:45,891
perhaps it's a bit vulgar.

922
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:48,489
But Pierre is right.

923
01:31:49,774 --> 01:31:52,010
They're getting the public
ready for something.

924
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:55,360
lt's obvious.

925
01:31:57,835 --> 01:31:59,460
Let's see the classifieds.

926
01:32:00,534 --> 01:32:01,862
Lost and found.

927
01:32:05,322 --> 01:32:07,907
No, nothing about the dog.

928
01:32:17,464 --> 01:32:18,723
Shut up.

929
01:32:57,674 --> 01:32:59,430
l read about it in the paper.

930
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:02,816
Did they all die?

931
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:04,483
Yes, all five of them.

932
01:33:10,374 --> 01:33:14,279
There was enough TNT
in the sidecars to blow up half of Paris.

933
01:33:20,779 --> 01:33:23,234
Not just the Gestapo headquarters.

934
01:33:30,282 --> 01:33:32,835
The poor devils didn't have much luck.

935
01:33:48,235 --> 01:33:50,090
You should leave now.

936
01:33:51,338 --> 01:33:53,345
The guard must have
finished his meal.

937
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:56,931
l'll show you out.

938
01:33:58,506 --> 01:34:00,295
Was he a relative?

939
01:34:01,194 --> 01:34:02,787
A friend?

940
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:05,887
Don't worry.

941
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:09,284
l'd do the same thing
if l was a bit younger,

942
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:11,457
or braver.

943
01:34:53,002 --> 01:34:55,752
- Did you bring my papers?
- lt was very difficult.

944
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,619
Here's your passport.

945
01:35:01,642 --> 01:35:03,682
""De Guigny.'' An aristocrat?

946
01:35:03,754 --> 01:35:04,932
Probably.

947
01:35:06,218 --> 01:35:07,942
That's the end of the Robert Kleins.

948
01:35:08,011 --> 01:35:09,985
One got blown up,
and the other--

949
01:35:10,058 --> 01:35:13,407
Here's your ticket to Marseilles,
and one for the ship.

950
01:35:13,482 --> 01:35:14,976
lt leaves in two days.

951
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,514
The money?

952
01:35:21,002 --> 01:35:23,587
Of course.
But at the last minute...

953
01:35:24,714 --> 01:35:26,584
How much?

954
01:35:26,218 --> 01:35:29,349
- Or should l say, how much less?
- Half a million.

955
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:33,538
Let me explain.
The buyer argued over the gold.

956
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,846
ln francs, he would've paid
twice as much.

957
01:35:35,914 --> 01:35:38,761
That doesn't matter.
Half a million, well...

958
01:35:38,826 --> 01:35:41,379
lt's quite reasonable and correct.

959
01:35:42,026 --> 01:35:43,684
- Or almost.
- You don't think l --

960
01:35:43,754 --> 01:35:46,437
No, of course not.

961
01:35:47,434 --> 01:35:49,638
- Should l count it?
- Yes, l want you to.

962
01:35:49,706 --> 01:35:51,648
l'll deny you that pleasure.

963
01:35:53,641 --> 01:35:55,071
Here you are.

964
01:35:55,614 --> 01:35:56,870
Keep your promise.

965
01:35:56,938 --> 01:35:59,272
Don't worry.
l've always wanted a dog like this.

966
01:35:59,339 --> 01:36:00,832
But he isn't just any dog.

967
01:36:00,907 --> 01:36:02,532
You can count on me.

968
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:06,271
Well, good-bye.

969
01:36:12,618 --> 01:36:15,400
- Good luck, Robert.
- Good luck to you.

970
01:36:15,467 --> 01:36:18,314
l must admit
l was getting fed up with France.

971
01:36:18,826 --> 01:36:21,696
We're too civilized, too polite.

972
01:36:22,378 --> 01:36:24,824
Too many tabs are kept on us.

973
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:26,659
Cheer up.

974
01:36:26,731 --> 01:36:28,323
You have half a million,

975
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:30,563
a fine dog,

976
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:32,390
and above all, Nicole.

977
01:37:06,694 --> 01:37:08,423
Nicole told me.

978
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:10,945
- When will you be back?
- l don't know.

979
01:37:11,018 --> 01:37:14,044
- Soon?
- l don't know.

980
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:17,608
- After the war?
- Maybe. l don't know.

981
01:37:17,674 --> 01:37:19,332
What about me?

982
01:37:19,946 --> 01:37:21,920
l really don't know.

983
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:28,901
l left the dog with Pierre.

984
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:31,720
But l don't trust him.
Promise to look after the dog?

985
01:37:31,882 --> 01:37:34,334
Yes.

986
01:38:33,482 --> 01:38:34,594
Here.

987
01:38:42,826 --> 01:38:44,419
Hello, Nathalie.

988
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:50,719
See? You've got the wrong person.

989
01:38:51,786 --> 01:38:52,931
Do l?

990
01:38:53,578 --> 01:38:57,768
No. You're wrong not to trust me.

991
01:39:03,014 --> 01:39:05,694
You don't know it,
but we're old friends, in a way.

992
01:39:06,634 --> 01:39:08,543
We have an old friend in common.

993
01:39:10,698 --> 01:39:12,486
Robert Klein.

994
01:39:17,764 --> 01:39:18,591
You know Robert?

995
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:21,448
Robert Klein,
32, Rue des Abbesses, second floor.

996
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:23,846
Poor Robert.

997
01:39:26,314 --> 01:39:28,550
We've left him all alone

998
01:39:29,322 --> 01:39:32,867
with his ghastly, lovesick concierge.

999
01:39:33,578 --> 01:39:35,683
He called her his kangaroo.

1000
01:39:40,809 --> 01:39:42,981
No, you're not a friend of Robert's.

1001
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:44,937
You just saw him at the station

1002
01:39:45,002 --> 01:39:46,856
and didn't even say hello.

1003
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,916
You're quite right.

1004
01:39:51,562 --> 01:39:53,831
l'm not his friend, nor is he mine.

1005
01:40:00,362 --> 01:40:02,654
Excuse me.

1006
01:40:46,378 --> 01:40:49,345
<i>- What is it?
- Open up. It's me-- Robert.</i>

1007
01:40:55,914 --> 01:40:58,054
Quick!

1008
01:41:03,498 --> 01:41:05,254
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

1009
01:41:05,322 --> 01:41:06,915
l need to make a call.

1010
01:41:09,444 --> 01:41:10,242
Hi, Nicole.

1011
01:41:15,434 --> 01:41:17,409
Go back to bed.

1012
01:41:20,010 --> 01:41:21,602
What about your ship?

1013
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,740
l may not need to go now.

1014
01:41:24,809 --> 01:41:26,752
l don't get it.
Who are you calling?

1015
01:41:28,393 --> 01:41:30,849
- Mr. Klein.
- But isn't he dead?

1016
01:41:32,618 --> 01:41:34,211
So you found his number?

1017
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:36,963
lt never changed.

1018
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:39,551
He never left.

1019
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:43,238
He put up a "For Rent" sign,
gave my card to the concierge,

1020
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:44,899
and returned home every night.

1021
01:41:56,266 --> 01:41:57,859
<i>Who's calling?</i>

1022
01:42:05,065 --> 01:42:06,723
<i>I was looking for you too.</i>

1023
01:42:06,794 --> 01:42:08,386
<i>I'd like to talk to you.</i>

1024
01:42:08,938 --> 01:42:11,011
Fine. When?

1025
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:13,447
<i>- Whenever you like.
- lmmediately.</i>

1026
01:42:13,513 --> 01:42:15,874
<i>All right. Where?</i>

1027
01:42:15,242 --> 01:42:17,663
At your place in half an hour.

1028
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:20,356
<i>- Do you have my address?
- Yes, l have your address.</i>

1029
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:23,491
<i>Good. I'll come down
in half an hour to let you in.</i>

1030
01:42:25,449 --> 01:42:27,075
You're not really going, are you?

1031
01:42:29,002 --> 01:42:30,431
That's why l came back.

1032
01:42:30,506 --> 01:42:32,895
What do you mean?
This is ridiculous.

1033
01:42:32,969 --> 01:42:34,660
Send the police.

1034
01:42:35,924 --> 01:42:37,381
- This is personal.
- But if you...

1035
01:42:39,273 --> 01:42:41,728
l said it's personal.

1036
01:44:25,802 --> 01:44:27,394
l had to do it.

1037
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:30,559
He's a criminal.

1038
01:44:30,633 --> 01:44:32,455
And l was afraid for you.

1039
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,285
Mr. Klein?

1040
01:47:47,433 --> 01:47:48,894
Robert de Guigny.

1041
01:48:37,865 --> 01:48:39,621
Where do you think they're taking us?

1042
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:43,234
l don't know.

1043
01:48:44,681 --> 01:48:46,405
But there's no need to worry.

1044
01:48:48,553 --> 01:48:50,624
ls there?

1045
01:48:50,793 --> 01:48:52,386
lt's just a routine check.

1046
01:48:52,457 --> 01:48:54,432
l don't know.

1047
01:48:57,194 --> 01:48:59,844
l hear they're going
to turn us over to the Krauts

1048
01:48:59,913 --> 01:49:01,320
and send us to Germany.

1049
01:49:03,529 --> 01:49:05,374
But it can't be true.

1050
01:49:05,929 --> 01:49:08,814
The French police would never
do that.

1051
01:49:10,026 --> 01:49:11,618
Don't you agree?

1052
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:13,544
l don't know anything.
How could l?

1053
01:49:13,610 --> 01:49:15,365
This has nothing to do with me!

1054
01:49:18,089 --> 01:49:19,682
l'm sorry.

1055
01:53:06,217 --> 01:53:07,810
Come on!

1056
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,964
Look! l've got the certificates!

1057
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:12,904
- l'll be back.
- Robert, what are you doing?

1058
01:54:15,785 --> 01:54:17,378
l'll be back.

1059
01:55:17,545 --> 01:55:19,204
<i>Six hundred louis.</i>

1060
01:55:19,561 --> 01:55:21,252
<i>Three hundred.</i>

1061
01:55:22,569 --> 01:55:24,740
<i>You must bejoking.</i>

1062
01:55:28,297 --> 01:55:30,631
<i>At that price, I'd rather keep it.</i>

1063
01:55:31,433 --> 01:55:33,058
<i>As you wish.</i>

1064
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:38,087
<i>It's easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell.</i>

1065
01:55:38,857 --> 01:55:41,028
<i>But I'm not forced to buy.</i>

1066
01:55:41,673 --> 01:55:43,778
<i>Make me a reasonable offer.</i>

1067
01:55:45,609 --> 01:55:47,332
<i>Three hundred.</i>
