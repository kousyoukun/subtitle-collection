1
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,240
Leave here, please.

2
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,875
Mr.Klein.

3
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,511
I know, but it's not to call me.

4
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,911
Maybe he has hidden somewhere, hasn't he?

5
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,636
I am a fool?

6
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,472
Speak!

7
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,629
My assistant heard about that the Jew's castles were shut

8
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,636
and the wealth was frozen.

9
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,357
All the Jew?

10
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,636
Yes, maybe.

11
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Listen, Robel. You can go on disguising to others.

12
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,592
But at least you should tell me.

13
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,676
Do be silly.

14
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,911
I must know what would happen.

15
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,149
I am a fool of the deepest dye.

16
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,556
I hate my eyes, my ears, everything.

17
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,640
I would rather wait as a soldier.

18
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,640
I am not clear why they suspect you in the Police Station.

19
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Everything is restricted. Be watched over on the road.

20
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,758
Because I am a good Frenchman in the system.

21
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,633
including picking up the phone.

22
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,518
Has I been wanted in the phone?

23
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,596
No.

24
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,636
I am Mr.Klein.

25
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,316
Somebody is waitting for you beside the phone.

26
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
There he is.

27
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,596
It seems he has gone.

28
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,398
What is he like?

29
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,598
Tall and lanky. Just like you.

30
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,557
You won't believe what he said, right?

31
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,473
No, it's time for shutdown.

32
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Why not?

33
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I want to stay here. I must continue to rent it.

34
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Because the fly cops asked me to do that.

35
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,596
Only until this morning.

36
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,596
Here you are, the rent.

37
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
No, I can't get the money.

38
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
It's for you.

39
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,596
For me? No, I can't get it.

40
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,439
You must be kidding me. You can't sleep over there.

41
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,516
Why?

42
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,438
The police seek through here tonight.

43
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,515
If there's any crab

44
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,550
I only stay here for a while.

45
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,635
You've seen it.

46
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,557
I wanna see again.

47
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,355
The Klein don't come back?

48
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,632
No.

49
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
He don't come back?
What's the girl's name?

50
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Issabrella

51
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Oh, Issabrella.

52
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,596
Does he got any relative?

53
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,189
I don't know.

54
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,079
Hi.

55
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Is you, Robel?

56
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,556
Yes.

57
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,795
I am in front of you. I saw you near the window.

58
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
What's up?

59
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,556
Nothing.

60
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,876
What's your plan?

61
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,316
What's what?

62
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,430
There's a someone always making phone call here. Who is that?

63
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,069
I don't know.

64
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,032
It's a lady.

65
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,355
What did she told you?

66
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,636
Great.

67
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,510
Issabrella.

68
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,557
There's no this girl.

69
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,635
Lola

70
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,715
What's wrong?

71
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,716
He's finding a girl.

72
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,556
Her name is Issabrella.

73
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
What a pity.

74
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Issabrella......

75
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,519
I don't know anybody called Issabrella.

76
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
It's not Issabrella. She's Cardi.

77
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,630
She no longer works here.

78
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,676
for about more than 2 months. At least three months.

79
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,512
Do you know where he lives?

80
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Maybe in the press factory.

81
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Who are you?

82
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,516
Do you know him?

83
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,312
Those famous men often meet him.

84
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,515
Why?

85
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,636
He's not a good guy.

86
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,590
I am not clear about it....

87
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,513
He looks like Corsica a little, alos he looks like Arab a little.

88
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,392
I feel dangerous when I get closed to him.

89
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,391
You look very sad.

90
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,389
The film...

91
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,440
What?

92
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,270
Nothing.

93
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:12,796
Whatever, fire her. She's a floater.

94
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,709
Prideful, and always bring a pistol.

95
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,869
A pistol?

96
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,519
Hurry up. It's your turn to dance next minute.

97
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Will you wait for me in the auditorium?

98
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Sure.

99
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
When we will meet?

100
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Wait for me.

101
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Where have you met before?

102
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
In BaIaro subway.

103
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,519
When we met, she told me that she had found another job.

104
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,716
Excuse me, Miss. Could I ask whether you have seen the girl?

105
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,036
Never. What's wrong?

106
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,076
I don't recognise her.

107
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,471
I can't find out anything.

108
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,476
Do you work here?

109
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Yes.

110
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Oh, you want her to be your girlfriend.

111
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Maybe.

112
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
It's strange. Actually she's not your girlfriend.

113
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
No, not yet.

114
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
What I wanna know is what's her job now.

115
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,992
There's a gentleman seeking the girl.
He wants to know who know her.

116
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,832
It's Florence.

117
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,151
New comer?

118
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,549
It's Florence.

119
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,200
Michelle and she work together.

120
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,158
Look at the photo of Florence.

121
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,352
Florence.

122
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,031
No, it's not her.

123
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,479
Michelle, come to tell the gentleman.

124
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,478
I've said that it's true.

125
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,919
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,196
You can deny what you said.

127
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,999
Whatever, it's not her.

128
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,829
I am not the guy on the photo.

129
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,436
Madeleine.

130
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,319
6 degree.

131
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,758
Edward Aramal

132
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,239
15 degree

133
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,356
Christin Mompana

134
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,633
25 degree

135
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:05,430
How you can invade my home and rob my wealth now?

136
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,914
It's not decided yet.

137
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,397
They denied my identity, took my car and my paintings.

138
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
All of mine was......

139
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
The search in that way is forbidden.

140
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
even the toilet.

141
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,439
All this was just because my grandmother was absent.

142
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,480
No, you can't take it.

143
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,435
This is not on stock.

144
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,074
It's not a merchandise, it's my private collection.

145
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,318
Director, you should have the search warranty.

146
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,436
Here you are.

147
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,439
You should have they know that it's not a personal problem.

148
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
It's law.

149
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
What did you say just now? Law?

150
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Because it comes down to me!

151
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
I paid another man to buy it.

152
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,074
It's the government that decided to do it.

153
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,515
It had nothing to do with me.

154
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,234
It's still not been checked.

155
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:08,716
It's not the first time that someone appeared to hide something.

156
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
How can I ensure? Director.

157
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,029
In fact I don't want to say it.

158
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,998
I am sorry, Mr mayor.

159
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,357
You should know that the law is so complicated.

160
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Pierre

161
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
How?

162
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
How is the girl?

163
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,397
Nothing is sure as the factory doesn't know the girl's being.

164
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,793
Robel

165
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,396
It doesn't matter.

166
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,399
When did you work on melodize?

167
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,396
I forgot it.

168
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,116
Is it hard to understand?

169
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,396
Almost.

170
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,399
The music book was copied by my friend.

171
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,670
Is it a march?

172
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,717
He can write down whatever it is.

173
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,559
Stop!

174
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,393
Why you get more and more stupid?

175
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,756
Go on.

176
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,399
You don't feel that it should be stopped right now?

177
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,399
I don't know how to do it as you do.

178
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I note down the address and I will to to pick my passport and ticket later.

179
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,356
You must pay for them.

180
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,279
At first you're going to the airport.

181
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,800
Do you like to sell your house?

182
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,113
Yeah, I will.

183
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,359
Of course...You will sell it.

184
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,039
How it costs?

185
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,356
Maybe hundreds of thousand.

186
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,473
7 or 8 million is OK?

187
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,479
Don't butt in the matter any longer.

188
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,358
Leave me alone.

189
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,594
Why? What are you thinking?

190
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,993
Nothing.

191
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,359
However, I won't sell it, I won't leave it.

192
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,589
Good morning, George.

193
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,949
Good morning.

194
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,869
Is it your dog?

195
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,149
No, I found it this morning. It seems to  like to stay here.

196
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Why not feed it at home?

197
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,355
You have never raise a dog?

198
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,478
Yes, but the dog belonged to another man.

199
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,392
Goodbye.

200
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,356
George, ask the dog to go back.

201
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,355
I don't know its name.

202
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,038
Get out!

203
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,713
Jeanine

204
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,873
Incredible.

205
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,360
I've got some impression on the dog.

206
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,316
Absolutely.

207
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,669
It wandered outside for the whole night.

208
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,920
It's finding its master.

209
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,274
Come here.

210
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,920
Let me find something for you to eat.

211
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,909
Robel

212
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,996
Just a while, Ok?

213
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,433
I don't feel well.

214
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,949
How?

215
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Drink some coffee.

216
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,952
Please sit down.

217
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,195
What you said is reasonable.

218
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,950
Three articles today.

219
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,230
There's nothing in the headline

220
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,828
as usual.

221
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,316
Look

222
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,556
Isn't it funny?

223
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,316
It's a bit out of time.

224
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,756
But it's still with reason.

225
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,319
Get prepared when things are going to happen.

226
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,316
apparently

227
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,350
Have a look at the Lost&Found in the adcolumn.

228
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,913
No news about it.

229
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,550
I saw it on newspaper.

230
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,480
They died instantaneously?

231
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,755
Yes, all the five men died instantaneously.

232
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,639
Only parts of the hand and the ancon were left entirely.

233
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,310
Now let's leave.

234
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,356
Leave together.

235
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,196
Is it your relative?

236
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,276
A friend?

237
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,276
Don't be nervous.

238
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,550
I've also met such things when I was young.

239
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,354
Be strong.

240
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,276
Have you brought them here?

241
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Yes.

242
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,276
Passport

243
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,193
Now there's no Robel Klein,

244
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,276
I bethink another Klein.

245
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,598
Tomorrow morning we will go there by ship.

246
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,114
It's sold at the last minute.

247
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,154
How much it cost?

248
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,276
500 thousand.

249
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,079
You would explain to the buyer why you leave now.

250
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,717
500 thousand? Sounds correct.

251
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,239
What's your plan?

252
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,436
Nothing.

253
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,236
Take care of it for me.

254
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,233
Ok.

255
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,032
Bye.

256
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Good luck!

257
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
The same to you.

258
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:37,473
We used to be too polite. There's no one here just like you.

259
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,319
You have 500 thousand, a dog and a artist.

260
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,353
Robel

261
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
It's Ikara who told me to go here.

262
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
When you will come back?

263
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
I don't know.

264
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
You will be back soon?

265
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
I don't know.

266
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
After the war?

267
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,236
I don't know.

268
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,236
Absolutely I don't know.

269
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,236
Jeanine

270
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,798
Wait for me, Ok?

271
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,109
Ok.

272
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,670
Good morning, Florence.

273
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,397
Good morning, Catherine.

274
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,359
Hold it.

275
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,876
Good morning, Natali

276
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,713
Morning

277
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,199
You are wrong just as you knew.

278
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
No.

279
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,199
It's you who want to make me doubt whether I'm wrong.

280
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,709
You look like one of my old friends much.

281
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,196
Robel Klein

282
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,353
Robel?

283
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,920
The same Robel?

284
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,673
Robel is a good name.

285
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,358
Poor Robel.

286
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,676
Now they're the same one.

287
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,069
It's oppressive  loneliness. Alone
The lover cannot concomitant.

288
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
You are not the same Robel?

289
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,151
Aren't you in Carie?

290
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,759
You even didn't say hello.

291
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,356
Right.

292
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,992
I am not his friend. He's not my friend either.

293
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,358
Excuse me.

294
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,113
Who?

295
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
It's me, Robel.

296
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,196
Robel?

297
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,196
Let me in.

298
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,468
What's wrong?

299
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,876
Nothing. I wanna make a phone call.

300
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,916
Go to sleep.

301
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,196
What you say is inexplicit.

302
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,151
Maybe there's no time.

303
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,430
Who do you make the call to?

304
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,399
Mr.Klein.

305
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,710
You still want to find him? Didn't he die?

306
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,595
How can you get his number?

307
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,796
Just as usual.

308
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,398
He shows his business card to the warder when going back to the room he rents.
He always stays there all night long.

309
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Is that Robel Klein?

310
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,156
Who are you?

311
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,196
Robel Klein.

312
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I am also seeking you at all times.

313
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
I wanna have a talk with you.

314
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Ok, when?

315
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Any time.

316
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Right now.

317
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Ok, where?

318
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Your home in half an hour.

319
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Do you got my address?

320
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,156
Yes.

321
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,033
Ok. I am waitting for you.

322
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,475
The reason I come back is for it.

323
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,795
What a wacky thing.

324
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,156
It's my personal affair.

325
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,033
I have said that it's my personal affair.

326
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,232
No!

327
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,156
Robel

328
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,156
Have you brought him away?

329
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,156
I am much worried about you.

330
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,479
Mr.Klein?

331
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,119
No.

332
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,116
Robel Kenny.

333
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,588
Guess where they send us.

334
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,359
I've no ideas.

335
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,076
Don't you worry?

336
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,076
To check the identity.

337
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,076
I don't know anything at all.

338
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,270
Because they hate us.

339
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,436
Send us to German.

340
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,712
But it's impossible.

341
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,918
The French police never do this.

342
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,312
You believe or not?

343
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,229
I don't know anything at all.

344
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,076
I am sorry.

345
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,240
Robel.

346
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,993
I got my identity certificate.

347
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,999
I will be back.

348
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,996
Why do you go there?

349
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,995
"600 Louis"

350
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,995
"300"

351
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,995
Do you remember me?

352
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,998
Sorry I don't.

353
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,997
"If it's such a low price, I would rather maintain it."

354
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,873
"As you wish."
