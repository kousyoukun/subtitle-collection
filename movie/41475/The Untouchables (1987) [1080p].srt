2
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:24,974
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

3
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:29,478
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

4
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:34,192
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

5
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:41,741
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

6
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,287
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

7
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,456
Some people say,
reformers here say:

8
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:52,627
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

9
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:56,297
What I hope I'm doing, and here's where
your English paper's got a point is,

10
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,799
I'm responding to
the will of the people.

11
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:06,349
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

12
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,352
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

13
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,356
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

14
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,816
I'm a businessman.

15
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,030
And what of your reputation is that you
control your business through violence?

16
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,868
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

17
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,376
It's all right.

18
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,754
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

19
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,799
We used to say, "You can get further
with a kind word and a gun" ...

20
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:43,094
"than you can
with just a kind word."

21
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,681
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

22
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,476
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

23
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:54,647
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me ...

24
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:59,151
and not by anybody I employ. And I tell
you why, because it's not good business.

25
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,645
Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.

26
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,857
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

27
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:42,278
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

28
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:46,199
I'm not buyin' any.

29
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:52,246
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

30
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,294
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

31
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:02,548
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

32
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,967
Oh, she does?

33
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:09,347
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

34
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,938
- There you go.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:22,443
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

36
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:25,071
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that ...

37
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,823
Hey, Mister! Wait!

38
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:31,410
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief ...

39
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:41,147
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

40
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,733
I know.

41
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,195
Now it's time to go to work.

42
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:58,497
You'll make a good first impression.

43
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,342
I love you, Eliot.

44
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,057
Now, shoo.

45
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:23,481
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

46
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,192
- Mr. Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

47
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,737
At the request of the City of Chicago,
the federal Government, specifically ...

48
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:33,699
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme ...

49
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,453
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

50
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:41,457
Mr. Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

51
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,544
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working ...

52
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:46,754
with the Chicago Police ...

53
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,173
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

54
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:53,553
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

55
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:57,640
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

56
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,060
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

57
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,687
It is the law of the land.

58
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,690
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

59
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:08,192
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

60
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,778
Do you have any political ambitions?

61
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,698
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

62
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,328
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

63
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,622
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

64
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,501
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

65
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:28,963
Mr. Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

66
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:32,133
Are you ready to meet the men?

67
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,553
Yes, I am.

68
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,357
I have one more thing to say.

69
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:55,489
I know that many of you take a drink.

70
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,577
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

71
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,331
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

72
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:09,128
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

73
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,922
But it's against the law.

74
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:15,384
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

75
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,767
Are there any questions?

76
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:27,522
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had ...

77
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,857
a man undercover here
for some time now.

78
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,109
We've received word
from this informant ...

79
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,821
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

80
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,741
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

81
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:51,462
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

82
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,924
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

83
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:59,679
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

84
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,308
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

85
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:14,694
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

86
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,536
- How are we doin'?
- Okay.

87
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,004
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

88
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,179
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

89
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:47,977
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

90
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,065
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:01,824
A message from my wife.

92
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,287
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

93
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,290
Nice to be married, huh?

94
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,309
Just follow me.

95
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,104
- Oh, God ...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

96
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,648
Get 'em up. Drop it.

97
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,442
Damn it, I can't, it'll break.

98
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,029
Mr. Ness. Look, I was just ...

99
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,323
Geez, I'm sorry.

100
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:30,079
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

101
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,498
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

102
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:37,169
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

103
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,630
Okay. Just shut up.

104
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,035
All right now ...
Let's do some good!

105
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:24,425
Hold it right there!

106
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,641
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

107
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,569
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

108
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,615
Preseuski.

109
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,786
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

110
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,956
- Mr. Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

111
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,709
Let him through here.

112
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:03,005
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

113
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:06,509
- You ready?
- Ready.

114
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,704
Liquor, huh?

115
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,125
Get him out of here.

116
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,462
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

117
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,595
That means you, too.

118
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,351
Christ!

119
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,350
Now, what do you think you're doing?

120
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,480
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

121
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,900
Don't you have
more important things to do?

122
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,278
Yeah.

123
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:33,030
But I'm not doing them right now.

124
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,951
Do we understand each other?

125
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,082
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

126
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,337
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

127
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,426
All right.

128
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:57,346
Just remember
what we talked about now.

129
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,728
Hey ... Wait a minute!

130
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:07,732
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn city?

131
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,818
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

132
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:14,780
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

133
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,117
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

134
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:27,084
What's your name and unit?

135
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,424
It's right here.

136
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:38,221
You got a beef?
What is it?

137
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,684
How did you know I had a gun?

138
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:47,647
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

139
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,400
No.

140
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,697
Are you okay, pal?

141
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:01,244
I had a rough day on the job.

142
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,957
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

143
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:12,922
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

144
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,930
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

145
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,308
Here endeth the lesson.

146
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,288
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

147
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

148
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,753
55 gallons to the barrel.

149
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,353
- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.

150
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,132
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good".

151
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:22,760
And then, we bust through ...

152
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:15,354
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes?

153
00:22:15,563 --> 00:22:18,900
I came here to thank you.

154
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,526
It was ...

155
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:24,530
my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

156
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,867
I'm sorry. Please.

157
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:32,038
I'm ... I'm so sorry.

158
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:38,044
You see, it's ... because I know
that you have children, too.

159
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:44,383
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

160
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:48,304
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

161
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:51,182
And you do that, now.

162
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:51,492
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

163
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,872
Come in.

164
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,253
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

165
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:06,424
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

166
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:12,847
- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.

167
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,642
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

168
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,730
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

169
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,941
If I'm such a good cop ...

170
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,237
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

171
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:30,364
Do you want to tell me?

172
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:33,451
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

173
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,413
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

174
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,624
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

175
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:43,586
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

176
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:48,132
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

177
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,802
I'm askin' you for help.

178
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,769
Well ... that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

179
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:08,778
Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and ... twenty pounds ago.

180
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:14,700
But ... I just think it got ...
more important to me ...

181
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,619
to stay alive.

182
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:27,922
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

183
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,898
That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.

184
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,651
I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!

185
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,196
- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.

186
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,825
Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.

187
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:59,954
Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.

188
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,206
Yeah, start it up, Andy.

189
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,258
Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!

190
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:17,180
Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!

191
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,892
Andy! She's boilin' over!

192
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:34,864
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes.

193
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:37,491
Oscar Wallace.

194
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,413
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

195
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,874
- Really?
- Yes.

196
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:49,795
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr. Wallace. Would you excuse me?

197
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,716
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have ...

198
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,885
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

199
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:59,972
And the one I want to try first ...
is this.

200
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,647
He has not filed a return since 1926.

201
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,860
- A return ...?
- An income tax return.

202
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:15,863
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:20,493
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

204
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:25,706
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here ...

205
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,001
Would you excuse me?

206
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,757
Please.

207
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,785
Okay. Let's go.

208
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:06,914
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

209
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,838
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

210
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:20,553
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

211
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:25,349
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

212
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,519
And then what are you
prepared to do?

213
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:31,105
If you open the ball
on these people,

214
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,858
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

215
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:37,236
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

216
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,530
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

217
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:44,619
Here's how you get Capone:
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

218
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,580
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

219
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:51,417
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

220
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:56,923
Now, do you want to do that?

221
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,842
Are you ready to do that?

222
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:05,473
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

223
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,935
I have sworn to put this man away,

224
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:14,315
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

225
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:25,493
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

226
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,878
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr. Ness?

227
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:39,048
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

228
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:44,303
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

229
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:48,140
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

230
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,811
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

231
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:56,524
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

232
00:29:56,732 --> 00:30:01,487
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

233
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,699
Because I swore to uphold the law.

234
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:07,743
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

235
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:12,206
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

236
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:16,502
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

237
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:21,549
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

238
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:24,093
Get it off the tree.

239
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:26,679
Get it off the tree ...

240
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:32,143
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

241
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,521
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

242
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,148
About face!

243
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:41,110
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr. Eliot Ness.

244
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,114
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

245
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:49,952
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full ...

246
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:53,414
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

247
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:58,544
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

248
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:01,172
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

249
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,966
- Good.
- Williamson!

250
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:08,679
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

251
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:13,392
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

252
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:18,022
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and ...

253
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,942
To protect and serve ...
To protect and ...

254
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,321
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

255
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,533
- What I think? I ...
- You ...

256
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:31,869
could help ... the force.

257
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,873
- You can help ...
- With the force.

258
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:40,711
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

259
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,803
At ease!

260
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:52,306
Stone! Out here.

261
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:56,602
This kid's a prodigy.

262
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:02,859
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and ...

263
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,028
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

264
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,283
Where are you from, Stone?

265
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,871
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

266
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,082
George Stone, that's your name?

267
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:23,921
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

268
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,465
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

269
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:33,181
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

270
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:36,309
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

271
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:39,145
What's that you said?

272
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:43,149
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

273
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:49,197
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

274
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,201
Oh, I like him.

275
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,414
Yeah, I like him, too.

276
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,918
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

277
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,421
Yeah, okay.

278
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,883
Eliot Ness.

279
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:13,012
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and ...

280
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,973
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

281
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:25,316
What do you think?

282
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,778
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

283
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:33,824
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

284
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:37,578
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

285
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,580
We need another man.

286
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,999
Mr. Ness? This is very interesting.

287
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:46,295
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu ...

288
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,464
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

289
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,716
Carry a gun.

290
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:09,694
- Jimmy ...?
- What?

291
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,532
What the hell are you dressed for?
Halloween?

292
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,617
Shut up. I'm working.

293
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:18,369
Where? The circus?

294
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:42,685
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

295
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,979
Liquor raid.

296
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,149
Here?!

297
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:52,653
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

298
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:57,825
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

299
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,877
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

300
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:17,762
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

301
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,932
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

302
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes, I do.

303
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,937
Good. Give me that axe.

304
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:37,615
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

305
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:40,117
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

306
00:35:41,202 --> 00:35:43,329
- Everybody ...
- What are you doin' here?

307
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:47,291
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

308
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,295
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

309
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:55,132
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

310
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:59,804
How do you think he feels now?
Better ... or worse?

311
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:10,982
- What is that?
- What is that?

312
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,360
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

313
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:19,574
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

314
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:24,245
Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

315
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,123
And policemen.

316
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:31,878
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

317
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:36,257
Lost causes, policemen ...

318
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:40,052
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

319
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:42,096
- You do?
- Yes.

320
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,515
Why?

321
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:49,353
'To protect the property
and the citizenry ... '

322
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,900
Whoa, it's all right.

323
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:56,611
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

324
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:00,615
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

325
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:03,701
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

326
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,537
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

327
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,791
Closer in ... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

328
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:21,093
Life goes on.

329
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,310
A man becomes pre-eminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

330
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,562
Enthusiasms ...

331
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,441
Enthusiasms ...

332
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:38,778
What are mine?

333
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:43,783
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

334
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:47,245
- Dames!
- Boozin'!

335
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:52,208
Baseball!

336
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,758
A man ...

337
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,303
A man stands alone at the plate.

338
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,933
This is the time for what?

339
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,645
For individual achievement.

340
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:16,357
There he stands alone.

341
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,735
But in the field, what?

342
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,197
Part of a team.

343
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,659
Teamwork ...

344
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:35,084
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

345
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:41,507
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

346
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:47,305
If his team don't field ... what is he?

347
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,392
You follow me?

348
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:54,270
No one.

349
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:59,609
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

350
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:05,239
I'm goin' out there for myself.

351
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:11,954
But ... I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

352
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,457
- Team!
- Team.

353
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,257
Jesus Christ!

354
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:49,325
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

355
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,912
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

356
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,915
'If I should die before I wake'

357
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:59,502
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

358
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,629
- Amen.
- God bless ...

359
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,800
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

360
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,010
Amen.

361
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,813
Good night.

362
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,065
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

363
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:25,111
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

364
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,874
- Where are you going?
- What?

365
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,836
Where are you going?

366
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:44,881
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

367
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:49,343
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

368
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:51,679
And you've still got
some energy left?

369
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:53,598
Oh, a lot of work.

370
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:59,437
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.

371
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:17,038
- How are we doin'?
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

372
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:21,667
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn ...

373
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:25,796
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings ...

374
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,633
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

375
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,427
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

376
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:35,264
Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs ... the list is endless!

377
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:39,185
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

378
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,396
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show ...

379
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:46,734
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

380
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:51,155
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

381
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:54,909
- Mr. Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

382
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:58,204
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman ...

383
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,289
Yes, I know who you are.

384
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:05,920
Would you excuse us?

385
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:11,843
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

386
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:15,263
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

387
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:21,227
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

388
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,649
What's that?

389
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:34,615
- What is that?
- Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

390
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:38,286
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

391
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:44,292
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

392
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:50,131
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

393
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,342
Would you come in here, please?

394
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,518
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

395
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,937
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag ...

396
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:08,774
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

397
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:13,362
You tell your master
that we must agree to ... disagree!

398
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:18,034
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

399
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:22,830
You fellows are 'untouchable',
is that it? No one can get to you?

400
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,417
You tell Capone ...
that I'll see him in hell.

401
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:31,631
Hey! Nice house!

402
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,675
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

403
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:39,972
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

404
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:42,141
Yes.

405
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,602
Nice to have a family.

406
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:50,024
Yes, it is.

407
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,737
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

408
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,671
Catherine?!

409
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:15,049
Catherine!

410
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:17,718
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

411
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:34,277
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

412
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:39,532
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

413
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:53,713
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

414
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:56,215
Okay, let's go.

415
00:44:56,424 --> 00:45:00,219
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

416
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:05,516
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

417
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:09,103
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

418
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:15,109
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

419
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:17,570
Take off your hat.

420
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:21,115
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

421
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:23,534
Yes, Mr. Ness.

422
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,497
Kiss.

423
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:31,834
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

424
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:37,423
Now, go!

425
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:01,155
Malone!

426
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,699
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

427
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:07,286
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

428
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:10,706
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

429
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:13,876
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

430
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:17,588
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

431
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:20,258
A huge international
shipment's coming.

432
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:25,054
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

433
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:28,349
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

434
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,435
How do you come by this information?

435
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:33,771
That's the second rule
of police work:

436
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,732
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

437
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,283
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

438
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:48,077
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

439
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:50,538
If we can establish
any payments to him,

440
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:53,791
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

441
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,334
What?

442
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:59,881
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

443
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:03,426
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

444
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,679
Well, it's better than nothing.

445
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:10,892
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

446
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,020
I don't know.

447
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:18,149
Go to sleep, Oscar.

448
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:08,074
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey ...

449
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:11,953
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

450
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:15,748
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

451
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:21,838
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

452
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,258
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

453
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:29,387
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

454
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:32,723
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

455
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:36,727
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

456
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,938
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

457
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:43,818
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr. Ness, is half the battle.

458
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:47,238
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

459
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:51,784
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

460
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:54,495
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

461
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:56,914
Thank you, Captain.

462
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,794
All right! Move out!

463
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:21,939
Take it easy.

464
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,527
Take it easy!
It'll all happen in time.

465
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:30,239
This is the job.

466
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:34,118
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

467
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:36,954
Just watch what does happen.

468
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,208
Are you my 'tutor'?

469
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:44,253
Yes, sir, that I am.

470
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,926
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

471
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:52,220
Then leave it alone.

472
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,473
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

473
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:59,310
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

474
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:05,816
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

475
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:09,111
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

476
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,406
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

477
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:16,953
Stitches and standing in the rain ...

478
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:48,359
Listen, Mr. Ness ...

479
00:50:50,236 --> 00:50:51,863
I had an idea.

480
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:50,421
You all have your spare shells?

481
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:09,440
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

482
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:12,568
And put your man down.

483
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:17,740
Because he'll do the same to you.

484
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:20,201
Shoot to kill.

485
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:24,747
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

486
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:28,793
Let's go.

487
00:52:52,275 --> 00:52:53,651
Easy ...

488
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,488
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

489
00:52:57,738 --> 00:53:01,284
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

490
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,202
George, the count's right.

491
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,706
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

492
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:09,584
Malone, you and I will
take the men ...

493
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:12,712
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

494
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,424
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

495
00:53:17,383 --> 00:53:18,718
Charge!

496
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:22,847
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'.

497
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:30,104
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

498
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,273
Move, move!

499
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:44,118
Let's go!

500
00:53:48,498 --> 00:53:49,790
I can't believe it!

501
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:53,044
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

502
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:55,046
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

503
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:15,775
Stone, take the first car!

504
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:19,946
Get this shit out of the way!

505
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:40,967
Tough guy!

506
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:45,930
Stone!

507
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,515
Go!

508
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:51,185
Stone!

509
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:53,604
I'm okay.

510
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:57,191
You thugs!

511
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:13,624
You all right?

512
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,711
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

513
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:33,436
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

514
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:37,356
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

515
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:40,568
Hello.

516
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,193
All right! Drop the gun!

517
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:06,863
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

518
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,991
I said, drop it!

519
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:13,452
Stop!

520
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:21,711
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

521
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,046
What are you, deaf?!

522
00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:27,341
What is this, a game?!

523
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:55,369
Here. Sit down.

524
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,839
Stone's gonna be all right.

525
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:10,009
I got the fellow with the satchel.

526
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:19,018
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

527
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:22,104
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

528
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:27,068
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

529
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:31,864
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

530
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:35,368
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

531
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:39,205
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

532
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:43,084
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

533
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:46,671
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

534
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:49,924
Why don't you kiss my ass?

535
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:52,301
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

536
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,595
- You've broken the law ...
- Eliot!

537
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:56,848
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

538
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,101
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

539
00:59:00,351 --> 00:59:03,104
- Eliot!
- What?!

540
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:05,648
Look at this!

541
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:08,734
- Look at this!
- What is this?

542
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:12,738
What is this?

543
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:17,285
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

544
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:21,747
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'?

545
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:26,794
And you got a heading here ...
'Circuit Court'.

546
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:30,631
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court'. What is this?

547
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:33,801
Nothin'. There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

548
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:37,388
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

549
00:59:37,597 --> 00:59:39,390
then we can put Capone away.

550
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,269
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

551
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,272
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

552
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,900
Translate this ledger for us!

553
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,693
- In hell.
- In hell?!

554
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:55,615
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

555
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:59,452
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

556
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,412
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

557
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:08,085
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

558
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:10,213
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

559
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:13,216
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

560
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:16,552
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

561
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,642
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

562
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,187
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

563
01:00:26,395 --> 01:00:28,397
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

564
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,775
I'm gonna count to three.

565
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:36,239
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

566
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:39,659
One.

567
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,790
Two!

568
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,252
Three.

569
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:51,796
I'm gonna talk!

570
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:56,592
Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

571
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,474
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

572
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:06,727
Now, ask him what you want to know.

573
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:11,107
All right ... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

574
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:15,486
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete ...

575
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:18,155
Mister Ness!

576
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,581
I do not approve of your methods!

577
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:32,461
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

578
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,926
- What?
- They got the shipment.

579
01:01:39,135 --> 01:01:41,679
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

580
01:01:41,888 --> 01:01:45,850
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate ...

581
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:51,981
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

582
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,777
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

583
01:01:56,986 --> 01:02:00,198
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

584
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:02,700
I want to piss on his ashes!

585
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:08,164
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

586
01:02:08,372 --> 01:02:11,626
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

587
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:13,794
- Yes.
- Like what?

588
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:17,006
Like what his name is.

589
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:21,385
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

590
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:24,096
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

591
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:28,184
No ... it'll be Edgar.

592
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:33,272
- It'll be J. Edgar ...
- I don't think so.

593
01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:39,237
God, you're beautiful.

594
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:43,324
You should have seen us last night.

595
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:48,538
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

596
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:52,041
I know. I understand, I do.

597
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:56,462
Just tell me, are you being careful?

598
01:02:56,671 --> 01:03:00,174
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

599
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:02,510
- Progress?
- Yes?

600
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,931
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

601
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:20,069
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone ...

602
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:25,199
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading ...

603
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:28,953
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

604
01:03:29,162 --> 01:03:32,290
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

605
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:36,586
Mr. Capone could have
up to 28 years.

606
01:03:36,794 --> 01:03:39,964
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

607
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:50,808
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

608
01:03:51,017 --> 01:03:53,144
- We'll call, let it ring ...
- Twice.

609
01:03:53,352 --> 01:03:55,271
- We'll call ...
- From the corner.

610
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:59,066
- Anybody knocks on the door ...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

611
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:02,278
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

612
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:05,281
Much more diverting
than accounting.

613
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:07,658
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

614
01:04:07,867 --> 01:04:11,329
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

615
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:19,754
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

616
01:04:20,004 --> 01:04:22,215
Okay, we see yous tonight.

617
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:26,177
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

618
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:37,939
he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

619
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:43,903
For which I must commend
the excellent work ...

620
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:47,782
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

621
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:52,745
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

622
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:55,915
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

623
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:59,085
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

624
01:05:00,294 --> 01:05:02,672
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

625
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,342
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

626
01:05:06,551 --> 01:05:10,888
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

627
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:16,394
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

628
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:18,187
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

629
01:05:18,396 --> 01:05:23,901
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

630
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:28,948
- You keep an eye out at all times ...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

631
01:05:29,156 --> 01:05:31,617
They are going to ...

632
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:43,004
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

633
01:05:49,135 --> 01:05:52,513
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

634
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:34,889
Oh, no.

635
01:06:35,973 --> 01:06:39,060
- No, no!
- Easy ... Easy!

636
01:06:41,604 --> 01:06:43,105
Oscar.

637
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:24,355
Oh, Jesus.

638
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:30,862
You gonna be all right?

639
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:56,179
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

640
01:07:57,263 --> 01:08:00,391
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

641
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,228
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

642
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:06,564
Jimmy!

643
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:10,443
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

644
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,695
You know what I mean?

645
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:31,714
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr. Capone ...

646
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:35,426
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr. Capone ...

647
01:08:35,885 --> 01:08:37,512
I said ...

648
01:08:44,143 --> 01:08:47,438
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

649
01:08:47,647 --> 01:08:50,399
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

650
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:55,613
Now he does.

651
01:08:55,821 --> 01:09:00,159
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

652
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:01,702
That's it, come on!

653
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:05,498
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

654
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:09,710
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

655
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:11,796
- What?
- Easy.

656
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:15,550
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

657
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:21,514
Easy. It's me. It's me!

658
01:09:21,764 --> 01:09:23,474
Not this way.

659
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:26,352
You fuck, you got nothin'!
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

660
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:32,275
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!

661
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:36,863
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin', you punk!

662
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:49,333
Well, no, I understand.

663
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:52,420
Believe me, I understand.

664
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:02,221
Well, what's happened?

665
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:08,311
He says he can't be unprotected.

666
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:12,732
What is it that the guy says?

667
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,568
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

668
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:19,113
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

669
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:23,576
So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will
announce that he's dropping the case.

670
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:27,663
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

671
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,541
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

672
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,420
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

673
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,548
Hello?

674
01:10:39,592 --> 01:10:41,636
Hello.

675
01:10:43,262 --> 01:10:45,264
Yes.

676
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:51,521
No, he didn't have a family.

677
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:56,692
How is everything there?

678
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:03,449
No, you do it however you want.

679
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:07,745
I promise I will.

680
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,165
You give her my love.

681
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:13,417
I love you, too.

682
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:20,716
Mr. Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

683
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:24,887
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti ...
- I think that's enough for today.

684
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:29,141
- If we don't stay on top ...
- That'll do. Thank you.

685
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:33,271
I'd like to request to stick around.

686
01:11:34,438 --> 01:11:37,024
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

687
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,994
Is that it?

688
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:51,706
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

689
01:11:51,914 --> 01:11:54,375
My question is, are we done?

690
01:11:56,377 --> 01:11:58,754
Yes, I think we're done.

691
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:01,841
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

692
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:04,427
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr. Wallace.

693
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:06,929
He's dead! And the D.A.
Is gonna drop the case!

694
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:09,432
He will not go into court
without a witness ...

695
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,602
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

696
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,648
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

697
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:20,651
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

698
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:38,753
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was ...

699
01:12:39,837 --> 01:12:42,632
- My wife?
- Yeah.

700
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:49,472
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

701
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:54,143
It's nice being married, eh?

702
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:56,729
Yes.

703
01:12:56,938 --> 01:13:00,233
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

704
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:04,737
going over ...
kitchen colour charts or something.

705
01:13:11,369 --> 01:13:17,083
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

706
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:25,925
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

707
01:13:28,344 --> 01:13:31,889
Get back to the D.A. And stall him.

708
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:36,769
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

709
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:42,608
I think I know how to find this guy.

710
01:13:44,694 --> 01:13:47,446
Walter?

711
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:52,660
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

712
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:55,830
We're leavin' tonight.

713
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:01,169
Two ball, down.

714
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,259
Mike, you got a minute?

715
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:11,137
I do now, don't I?

716
01:14:12,263 --> 01:14:15,558
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

717
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:19,061
This is a place for cops.

718
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:21,856
Can we step outside?

719
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:26,444
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

720
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:36,204
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

721
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:41,292
What? What?!

722
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:44,587
I just need one more
piece of information.

723
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:46,756
One more? Jimmy!

724
01:14:46,964 --> 01:14:52,011
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

725
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:59,101
Are you crazy? You're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

726
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:03,314
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

727
01:15:03,523 --> 01:15:08,110
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

728
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:10,571
And I tried to save your life.

729
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:16,035
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.

730
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:19,413
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

731
01:15:19,622 --> 01:15:24,627
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

732
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:29,048
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

733
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:34,804
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

734
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:42,311
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

735
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,524
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

736
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:50,862
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

737
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,116
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

738
01:15:55,324 --> 01:15:57,869
I'm gonna turn you over!

739
01:15:58,077 --> 01:16:01,622
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

740
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,626
You're dead.

741
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:29,901
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

742
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:32,945
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'.

743
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,582
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

744
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:47,835
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

745
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:50,546
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

746
01:16:50,755 --> 01:16:54,342
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool ...

747
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,178
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

748
01:16:57,386 --> 01:16:59,972
I have men out there
risking more than that.

749
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:02,683
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead ...

750
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:07,855
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

751
01:17:09,941 --> 01:17:11,984
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

752
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:13,778
He's at the D.A. 's.

753
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,948
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

754
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:37,969
- Al! Al!
- Mr. Capone!

755
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:42,598
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.

756
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:46,936
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

757
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:51,190
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole',

758
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:54,652
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

759
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:56,279
You understand?

760
01:17:57,113 --> 01:18:01,617
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

761
01:18:01,826 --> 01:18:04,579
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

762
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:11,252
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

763
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,088
To speak to me like men? No.

764
01:18:14,297 --> 01:18:17,216
To harass a peaceful man.

765
01:18:18,634 --> 01:18:20,678
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

766
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:24,265
I would have
just a little more self respect.

767
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,813
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

768
01:18:31,022 --> 01:18:33,983
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

769
01:21:21,692 --> 01:21:23,945
Isn't that just like a wop?

770
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,865
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

771
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:34,705
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

772
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:38,209
Go on, get your ass out of here!

773
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:22,230
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

774
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:26,067
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

775
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:27,693
Round the back.

776
01:23:37,286 --> 01:23:39,497
Malone!

777
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:44,418
Malone.

778
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,282
Goddamn! Stone!

779
01:24:16,826 --> 01:24:18,995
Stone!

780
01:24:20,246 --> 01:24:22,623
The phone!

781
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,295
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

782
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:33,759
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

783
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,888
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

784
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:40,683
This? You want this?

785
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:46,772
You want this?

786
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:55,448
What?

787
01:25:02,622 --> 01:25:04,624
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

788
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,919
- Book ...
- The bookkeeper?

789
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:11,339
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

790
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:14,842
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

791
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:17,136
He's on this train.

792
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:21,766
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

793
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:27,230
No. Malone. No.

794
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:30,191
Stay. Stay.

795
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,819
Stay! Malone ...

796
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:35,071
No. No, no!

797
01:25:36,864 --> 01:25:40,368
Not this ... Not this man ...

798
01:26:06,102 --> 01:26:10,648
Train's leavin' for Miami
12:05, Mr. Ness.

799
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,402
We'll be there.

800
01:26:16,612 --> 01:26:19,991
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

801
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:22,952
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

802
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,631
Cover the south entrance.

803
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,891
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

804
01:27:29,393 --> 01:27:35,358
Your attention, please. The Miami
Flier departs at 12:05 from 33.

805
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,610
All aboard.

806
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:52,041
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

807
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:56,587
Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.

808
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:12,436
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05,

809
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:16,566
now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!

810
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:33,249
Just here.
I'm just gonna leave this right here.

811
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:28,095
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05,

812
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:33,559
is now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!

813
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,145
One more. Here we go.

814
01:29:58,668 --> 01:30:00,461
Here we go. You ready?

815
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,466
I'm right here, honey. Here we go.

816
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:10,638
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention, please?

817
01:30:10,888 --> 01:30:13,432
This is the final call
for the Miami Flier,

818
01:30:13,683 --> 01:30:17,937
leaving at 12:05 on track 33.
All aboard!

819
01:30:57,268 --> 01:31:02,732
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

820
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,360
Are you all right? Thank you.

821
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:11,032
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

822
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,244
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

823
01:31:18,915 --> 01:31:21,834
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

824
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:26,130
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

825
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:34,305
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

826
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,810
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

827
01:31:41,771 --> 01:31:43,898
Thank you, sir.

828
01:31:52,532 --> 01:31:56,202
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

829
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,497
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

830
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:07,129
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

831
01:32:09,298 --> 01:32:12,927
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

832
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:16,347
Is something wrong?

833
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:18,933
Sir?

834
01:34:14,841 --> 01:34:17,468
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

835
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:21,806
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

836
01:34:25,309 --> 01:34:27,854
- What are you doin'?
- Shut the fuck up!

837
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:31,399
- Hold it!
- Please ...

838
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:34,235
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

839
01:34:36,988 --> 01:34:38,781
I said hold it!

840
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:42,743
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

841
01:34:42,994 --> 01:34:45,913
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

842
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:50,793
See? Or else he dies.

843
01:34:51,002 --> 01:34:54,046
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'.

844
01:34:57,466 --> 01:35:00,678
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

845
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:06,434
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'!

846
01:35:06,642 --> 01:35:11,063
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

847
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:13,774
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

848
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:20,865
- One!
- Will you stop it!

849
01:35:27,413 --> 01:35:29,415
Take him.

850
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,544
Two.

851
01:35:59,695 --> 01:36:02,365
The two coded entries
in this ledger ...

852
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:07,245
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

853
01:36:07,453 --> 01:36:13,125
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

854
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:17,964
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

855
01:36:19,549 --> 01:36:21,801
I said that is correct.

856
01:36:22,051 --> 01:36:26,848
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

857
01:36:29,058 --> 01:36:31,185
I will.

858
01:36:31,394 --> 01:36:33,729
Sorry, Mr. Payne, I can't hear you.

859
01:36:33,938 --> 01:36:36,732
I said, I will.

860
01:36:36,941 --> 01:36:41,654
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr. Capone?

861
01:36:41,863 --> 01:36:43,197
Yes, I was.

862
01:36:43,406 --> 01:36:46,450
And you personally
distributed monies ...

863
01:36:46,659 --> 01:36:50,705
vast, undeclared monies ...

864
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:54,250
to Mr. Capone?

865
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,836
Yes, I did.

866
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:59,881
Would you tell us the amounts?

867
01:37:01,299 --> 01:37:07,430
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr. Capone ...

868
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,560
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

869
01:37:15,354 --> 01:37:18,232
Would you repeat that amount, please?

870
01:37:19,317 --> 01:37:25,072
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

871
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:43,716
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

872
01:37:43,966 --> 01:37:48,095
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

873
01:38:11,202 --> 01:38:14,497
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

874
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:20,127
Get me the bailiff.

875
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:23,130
It'll be a fast trial.

876
01:38:26,926 --> 01:38:31,347
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

877
01:38:31,556 --> 01:38:36,477
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

878
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,404
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

879
01:39:14,557 --> 01:39:19,562
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

880
01:39:20,605 --> 01:39:24,358
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

881
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:28,196
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

882
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,162
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

883
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:41,000
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

884
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:43,461
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

885
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:47,507
"Mr. Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

886
01:39:47,757 --> 01:39:50,176
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

887
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:53,846
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

888
01:39:54,055 --> 01:39:58,017
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

889
01:39:58,226 --> 01:40:01,395
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

890
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:36,848
1634 Racine ... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

891
01:40:50,987 --> 01:40:53,614
Don't. Let him go.

892
01:40:57,285 --> 01:41:00,454
- No!
- Here, take it.

893
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:16,210
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

894
01:45:17,712 --> 01:45:19,964
What are you waitin' for?

895
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:24,051
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

896
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:30,516
Don't push me.

897
01:45:33,186 --> 01:45:35,897
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

898
01:45:36,105 --> 01:45:39,233
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

899
01:45:39,442 --> 01:45:41,611
'Cause you killed my friend!

900
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:45,448
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

901
01:45:45,698 --> 01:45:49,285
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

902
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:52,997
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

903
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:09,222
Did he sound anything like that?

904
01:46:39,627 --> 01:46:42,547
One picture, come on, one picture.

905
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:47,802
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.

906
01:46:49,387 --> 01:46:51,180
Mr. Ness?

907
01:46:52,807 --> 01:46:57,270
Mr. Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

908
01:46:58,354 --> 01:47:01,232
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr. Ness.

909
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,234
They've been bribed.

910
01:47:03,442 --> 01:47:07,530
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

911
01:47:09,073 --> 01:47:11,200
He's in the car.

912
01:47:30,011 --> 01:47:34,140
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow ...

913
01:47:34,348 --> 01:47:40,021
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

914
01:47:40,271 --> 01:47:45,151
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

915
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,447
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

916
01:47:49,655 --> 01:47:54,285
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must ...

917
01:47:54,494 --> 01:47:57,914
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

918
01:48:07,924 --> 01:48:10,510
Would you excuse us?

919
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,574
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

920
01:49:19,245 --> 01:49:22,039
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

921
01:49:22,248 --> 01:49:25,376
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

922
01:49:25,585 --> 01:49:30,840
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

923
01:49:32,633 --> 01:49:36,304
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

924
01:49:37,388 --> 01:49:38,931
What's he talking about?

925
01:49:40,808 --> 01:49:45,271
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

926
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,815
Your Honour, I object!

927
01:49:48,024 --> 01:49:49,984
Overruled.

928
01:49:53,988 --> 01:49:55,781
What did you tell him?

929
01:49:57,575 --> 01:50:00,828
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

930
01:50:02,163 --> 01:50:04,957
His name wasn't in the ledger!

931
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:08,211
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

932
01:50:08,461 --> 01:50:09,921
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

933
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:13,466
- I think ...
- Do somethin' here.

934
01:50:13,674 --> 01:50:16,260
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'!

935
01:50:16,844 --> 01:50:18,846
Order!

936
01:50:19,931 --> 01:50:24,185
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

937
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:26,354
and enter a plea of Guilty.

938
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:32,735
- Guilty?
- Order in the court!

939
01:50:32,985 --> 01:50:34,987
Order!

940
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:46,833
Bailiff! Bailiff!

941
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:49,502
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

942
01:50:51,003 --> 01:50:52,338
Eliot!

943
01:50:52,547 --> 01:50:55,716
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

944
01:50:55,925 --> 01:50:58,594
Please, why did he switch the jury?

945
01:50:58,803 --> 01:51:01,389
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

946
01:51:01,597 --> 01:51:03,057
Excuse me.

947
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:07,645
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

948
01:51:12,483 --> 01:51:14,735
Is this justice?

949
01:51:17,613 --> 01:51:20,324
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

950
01:51:20,533 --> 01:51:22,034
What did you say?

951
01:51:22,243 --> 01:51:25,371
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

952
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:27,623
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

953
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:30,376
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

954
01:51:30,585 --> 01:51:33,379
Here endeth the lesson.

955
01:51:33,588 --> 01:51:37,842
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

956
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:41,262
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

957
01:52:59,423 --> 01:53:01,592
So much violence.

958
01:54:07,825 --> 01:54:10,244
Cleaning up a little.

959
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,923
I guess this is goodbye.

960
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:24,842
Goodbye, George.

961
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,556
I want to ... thank you for this.

962
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:33,434
No. Thank you.

963
01:54:49,325 --> 01:54:53,955
Mr. Ness ... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

964
01:54:54,163 --> 01:54:57,250
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

965
01:55:00,878 --> 01:55:03,464
I'm going home.

966
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:17,019
Mr. Ness!
Any comment for the record?

967
01:55:17,228 --> 01:55:19,939
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

968
01:55:20,106 --> 01:55:22,692
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

969
01:55:22,942 --> 01:55:25,945
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

970
01:55:26,154 --> 01:55:29,240
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
