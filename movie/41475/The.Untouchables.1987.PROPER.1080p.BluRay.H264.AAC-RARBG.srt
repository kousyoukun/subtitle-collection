1
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,040
《鐵面無私》

2
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,710
1930年 禁酒令使芝加哥爆發戰爭

3
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,420
幫派人物爭奪地盤

4
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,930
以走私酒而 掌控億萬元的強大帝國

5
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,640
相互使用暴力手段 來鞏固自己的勢力

6
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,940
這是一個幫派爭鬥的時代 這是梟雄艾爾卡彭的時代

7
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,870
報紙上有篇文章曾這樣報導 事實上你是實際的
An article, which I believe appeared in a newspaper, asked why, since it would seem that you are

8
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,140
芝加哥市長 你只是差一紙委任令而已
in effect the Mayor of Chicago, you're not simply being appointed to that position.

9
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,460
我告訴你，這很動人
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.

10
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,470
人生很多事亦是如此
Like a lot of things in life,

11
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,050
有很多事可笑 因為那是真的
we laugh because it's funny, and we laugh because it's true.

12
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,470
有些人說，改革者也說
Some people say, reformers here say:

13
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,480
「把那人關進監獄，他以為 他在幹什麼？」
"Put that man in jail, what does he think he is doing?"

14
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,150
同樣的，我在幹什麼 你們報紙要弄清楚
What I hope I'm doing, and here's where your paper's got a point,

15
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,730
我是在反映人們的意見
is I'm responding to the will of the people.

16
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,240
人們要喝酒，你知道我知道 大家都知道
People are gonna drink. We all know that.

17
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,240
我只是採取行動
All I do is act on that.

18
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,040
說什麼販賣私酒？ 什麼叫是販賣私酒？
And all this talk of bootlegging. What is bootlegging?

19
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,620
放在船上那叫販賣私酒 放在大酒店那叫盛情好客
On the boat it's bootlegging, on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

20
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,000
我只是個生意人
I'm a businessman.

21
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,510
你怎麼解釋外頭傳聞 你以暴力掌控生意？
Your reputation is that you control your business through violence.

22
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,220
把你的貨強迫推銷出去？
That those that don't purchase your product are dealt with violently.

23
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,520
沒事
It's all right.

24
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,730
我在惡劣環境下長大
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

25
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,040
我們常說，「槍桿和好話並用 勝過單單講好話」
We used to say, "Y ou can get further with a kind word and a gun" "than you can with just a kind word."

26
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,780
在我那種環境是真的
And in that neighbourhood it might've been true.

27
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,200
然後你會贏得好名聲
And sometimes your reputation follows you.

28
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,710
芝加哥的確有暴力存在
There is violence in Chicago,

29
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,290
但並不在於我 或是我僱傭的人
but not by me and not by anybody I employ.

30
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,040
我告訴你們原因 因為那不是好生意
Because it's not good business.

31
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,700
（開場）

32
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,580
走開，不要打攪我們 沒事
Leave us alone down here,

33
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,700
我們不需要任何東西
we've got everything we need.

34
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,790
你那些綠色啤酒毫無用處
The green beer you're peddlin' ain't any good.

35
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,000
毫無用處，但很值得一買
It's not supposed to be good. It's supposed to be bought.

36
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,550
我什麼也不買
I'm not buyin' any.

37
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,100
別擔心 我們不會回來了
Don't worry about it, Pops, we won't come back.

38
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,100
你家裏人都好嗎？ 他們很好
- How's everyone at your house today? - They're fine.

39
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,150
你媽媽好嗎？ 她有點感冒
- Is your Mama well? - She has a little cold.

40
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,570
哦，是嗎？
Oh, she does?

41
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,240
我很難過聽到這事 不過，她很快會沒事的
- I'm sorry to hear that. - But she'll be all right.

42
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,750
給你 謝謝
- There you go. - Thank you.

43
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,960
不客氣，小可愛 過馬路時要當心
That's all right, sweetie. You be careful crossin' the street.

44
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,840
先生！先生 告訴你媽媽…
- Mister! - You tell your Mama that...

45
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,800
喂，先生，等一下
Hey, Mister! Wait!

46
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,300
先生，等一下，你忘了你的手提箱…
Mister! Wait! You forgot your brief...

47
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,770
（1930年9月14日星期天）

48
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
（1930年9月15日星期一）

49
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,860
（私酒戰爭屠殺十歲女孩）

50
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,660
是的，我聽到收音機廣播了
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

51
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,460
我瞭解
I know.

52
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,710
上班時間到了
Now it's time to go to work.

53
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,260
你要給人第一眼好印象
You'll make a good first impression.

54
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,230
我愛你，艾略特
I love you, Eliot.

55
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,330
走吧
Now, shoo.

56
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,500
艾略特奈斯，財政部特別員
Eliot Ness, Special Agent of the Treasury Department.

57
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,170
奈斯先生 謝謝你，局長
- Mr Ness. - Thank you, Chief.

58
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,210
應芝加哥市民要求
At the request of the City of Chicago,

59
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,590
聯邦政府 令財政部
the Department of the Treasury has inaugurated a programme

60
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,400
成立專案 制止私酒販責 及其所引發的暴力
to deal with the flow of illegal liquor and the violence it creates.

61
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,350
奈斯先生！ 這個計劃包括什麼？
Mr Ness! Of what does this programme consist?

62
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,520
我和其他財政部專員 將與芝加哥警方合作…
I and other agents of the Treasury will be working with the Chicago Police...

63
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,940
這是否又是官僚炒新聞？
Isn't it just another showpiece programme?

64
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,530
你對禁酒令有何看法？ 你喝酒嗎，奈斯先生？
- What do you think of prohibition? - Do you drink, Mr Ness?

65
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,410
奈斯先生，回答問題
- Come on, answer the questions.

66
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,410
這不是炒新聞
- It's not just a showpiece.

67
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,660
我來告訴你們我對禁酒令的看法
And I'll tell you how I feel about prohibition.

68
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,290
那是國家法律
It is the law of the land.

69
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,370
你自認為是掃蕩戰士嗎？ 奈斯先生？
Do you consider yourself a crusader, is that it?

70
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,550
你有何專長可以擔當這個任務？ 你可有政治野心？
What qualifications do you have for the job? Do you have any political ambitions?

71
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,460
好了，今天到此為止
All right, boys, I think that's enough.

72
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,590
最後一個問題，奈斯先生 麻煩讓一下
The last qustion, Mr Ness! Please.

73
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,050
先生，你有何計劃？ 打算如何著手？
What are your real plans? What have you got coming up?

74
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,350
你去看報紙吧
You'll have to read about it in the paper.

75
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,640
讓我和你同去 不
- Let me ride along with you. - No.

76
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,270
我們會配合你的 不，愛莫能助
Can't help you.

77
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,520
奈斯先生，奧德森中尉，飛騎警隊
Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson, the Flying Squad.

78
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,440
你準備會見弟兄了嗎？
Are you ready to meet the men?

79
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,820
是的，我準備好了
Yes, I am.

80
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,790
（武器登記預備室）

81
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,000
我還有一件事情要說
I have one more thing to say.

82
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,050
我知道你們很多人喝酒
I know that many of you take a drink.

83
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,340
今天以前的事我不管
What you've done before today is not my concern.

84
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,350
但今後要自律，停止喝酒
But now we must be pure, and I want you to stop.

85
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:09,080
問題不在於喝酒是否傷身 雖然很可能傷身
It's not a question of whether it's 'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

86
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,980
而在於那違反法律，各位
But it's against the law.

87
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,820
我們要厲行法律便要以身作則
And as we are going to enforce the law, we must do first by example.

88
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,830
有問題嗎？
Are there any questions?

89
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,370
很好
Good.

90
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,810
財政部有位密探臥底一段時間了
The Department of the Treasury's had a man undercover here for some time now.

91
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,960
我們接獲情報
We've received word from this informant

92
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,550
昨天自加拿大運來了大批私酒
that a large shipment of Canadian whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

93
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,130
所以我希望你們準備一下
So I hope that you have signed on for some action.

94
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,090
我們要去抓他們了
We're got for him

95
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,890
記住 私酒箱上有紅色楓葉記號
Remember, the liquor cases are marked with the red maple leaf.

96
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,600
是，長官，我知道
Yes sir

97
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,730
密探穿的是灰大衣白圍巾
The Treasury Agent is in a grey suit with a white scarf.

98
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
不要抓他 灰大衣和白圍巾
- He is not to be arrested. - A grey suit and a white scarf.

99
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,580
就這樣，你的人準備好了？ 是的，長官，都準備好了
- That's it. Are your men ready? - Yes, sir. They are.

100
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,290
很好
Good

101
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,130
稍息 準備對付壞蛋
- At ease. - Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

102
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,760
準備如何？ 好了！
- How are we doin' - Okay.

103
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,310
來點三明治？ 不，謝謝長官
- Want part of a sandwich? - No, thank you, sir.

104
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,400
你緊張嗎？ 不，長官
- You nervous? - No, sir.

105
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,870
你在這警局很久了？ 才一陣子
- Been with the unit long? - A short while.

106
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,420
我想大家都想把事做好 是的，長官
- I suppose we all want to do well. - Yes, sir.

107
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,630
（我非常以你為榮！）

108
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,090
我太太寫的字條
A message from my wife.

109
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,140
你結婚了？ 是的
- You married? - Yes, sir, I am.

110
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,220
結婚不錯，是吧？
Nice to be married, huh?

111
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,200
跟我來
Just follow me.

112
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,500
哦，天啊！ 聯邦官員，手舉起來！
- Oh, God... - Federal officer. Hands in the air.

113
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,460
手舉起來，東西放下
Get 'em up. Drop it.

114
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,210
我不能，會砸壞
Damn it, I can't , it'll break.

115
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,880
奈斯，聽著，我正要…
Mr Ness. Look, I was just...

116
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,550
天啊，對不起
Geez, I'm sorry.

117
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,970
聽著，我可以為你做 許多你奮力拚搏的事情
Listen, I can do a lot for you, what you're tryin' to do.

118
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,270
我搶頭條新聞 替你宣揚
I get the big scoop, you make a big splash.

119
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,520
爭取新聞界支持如何
Get some support. What do you say?

120
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,730
讓我幫你，如何？
Let's be real, let me help you.

121
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,230
閉嘴
Okay. Just shut up.

122
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,050
好了，各位… 我們大幹一場吧！
All right now... Let's do some good!

123
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,110
站住別動！
Hold it right there!

124
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,360
聯邦官員！
Federal officer.

125
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,410
你們因違反禁酒令被捕了
You're under arrest for violations of the Volstead Act.

126
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,630
守住門口！ 別讓罪犯逃了！
Let's cover the doors! Don't let anybody out!

127
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,340
普勒斯基
Preseuski.

128
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,720
不好意思，我有許可 誰批准的？
- I'm here with permission. - Who gave you permission?

129
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,850
奈斯先生！ 不要緊，讓他進來
- Mr Ness! - Sorry, let him through here.

130
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,140
讓他進來
Let him through here.

131
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,480
你要拍照就現在拍吧
You want to take your picture, take it now.

132
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,070
準備好了？ 準備好了
- You ready? - Ready.

133
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,470
這是酒？
Liquor, huh?

134
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,930
下雨了嗎？
Rain?

135
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,020
帶他出去 快點
Get him out of here.

136
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,690
把這地方徹底解散！ 現在，帶他出去！
- Tear the place apart! - I mean now, get him out!

137
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,060
是，長官！
Yes sir.

138
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,730
好了，走吧
Ok,let's go.

139
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,240
你也出去
That means you, too.

140
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,910
天啊！
Christ!

141
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,610
（緝酒戰士奈斯灰頭土臉）

142
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,660
（差勁的艾略特奈斯）

143
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,610
（我非常以你為榮！）

144
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,780
你在幹什麼？
Now, what do you think you're doing?

145
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,950
要丟垃圾？ 就丟到垃圾筒裏
You want to throw garbage? Throw it in the goddamn trash basket.

146
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,870
你沒有更重要的事做嗎？
Don't you have more important things to do?

147
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,460
有
Yeah.

148
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,420
但我不必現在去做
But I'm not doing them right now.

149
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,380
我們彼此心知肚明
Do we understand each other?

150
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,010
好了，朋友，別亂動
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

151
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,020
你為何帶著槍？ 我是財政部特派員
- Why are you packin' the gun? - I'm a Treasury Officer.

152
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,610
好吧
All right.

153
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,650
你只要記著我們照過面就夠了
Just remember what we talked about now.

154
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,540
喂，等一下！
Hey... Wait a minute!

155
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,500
這個城市的警員是怎麼回事 他們是怎麼教你的？
What the hell kind of police do you have in this goddamn city?

156
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,080
你竟不管帶槍的人
You just turned your back on an armed man.

157
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,840
你是位財政部官員
- You're a Treasury officer.

158
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,420
何以見得？ 那只是我說的而已
- I just told you I was.

159
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,380
誰願意冒充財政部官員？ 我哪管得著？
Who would claim to be that, who was not?

160
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,020
你的姓名和單位？
What's your name and unit?

161
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,190
在這上面
It's right here.

162
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,360
你有牢騷？怎麼回事？
You got a beef? What is it?

163
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,820
你怎麼知道我有帶槍？
How did you know I had a gun?

164
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,540
你要什麼？ 討教會警員的絕招嗎？
What do you want, a free lesson in police work?

165
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,540
不
No.

166
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,550
你還好吧？朋友
Are you okay, pal?

167
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,090
我工作不順利
I had a rough day on the job.

168
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,810
你要回家了嗎？ 我正要回去
- Are you going home now? - I was about to.

169
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,400
你已做到了 執法者規則第一條
Well, then, you just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement.

170
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,650
確保能活著下班回家
Make sure when your shift is over you go home alive.

171
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,070
第一課結束
Here endeth the lesson.

172
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,140
總數十萬元，一共40桶
$100,000 for 40 barrels.

173
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,260
確保沒有空的
Make sure there are no empties.

174
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,600
我給你的底帳都在帳薄裏
I'm gonna give you the ledger, everything is in the book.

175
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,850
桶是55加侖
55 gallons to the barrel.

176
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,870
我是艾迪 進來，艾迪
- It's Eddie. - Come in, Eddie.

177
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,110
他坐進除雪車裏說道 「我們好好幹一場」
So, he gets into the snowplough, and he says, "Let's do some good" .

178
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,030
然後我們破門而入...
And then, we bust through...

179
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,510
（艾略特奈斯）

180
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,470
（財政部特別調查處）

181
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,330
奈斯先生？ 什麼事？
- Mr Ness? - Yes?

182
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,790
我是來謝謝你的！
I came here to thank you.

183
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,440
被炸死的小女孩是我女兒
It was... ..my little girl that got killed with that bomb.

184
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,720
我很難過，請進
I'm sorry. Please.

185
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,260
我很難過
I'm ...l'm so sorry.

186
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,810
你瞭解…
You see, it's ...

187
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,980
我知道你也有小孩
because I know that you have children, too.

188
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,520
這是那些人帶來的真實悲劇
And that this is real for you, that these men cause us tragedy.

189
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,940
我知道你要阻止他們
And I know that you will put a stop to them.

190
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,070
我知道你會的
And you do that, now.

191
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,230
（拉辛大街）

192
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,180
你要幹什麼？ 我想和你談談
- What do you want? - I'd like to talk to you.

193
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,850
進來吧
Come in.

194
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,020
我要找一批人 奈斯…
I need a small group of men, handpicked, starting with you.

195
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,330
首先指名道姓找上你 奈斯，我只是個可憐的巡夜警員
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

196
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,860
我該怎麼幫你？
- Now, how can I help you?

197
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,780
只要和我一起辦事
- Just work with me.

198
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,370
我為什麼要？ 因為你是好警員
- But why should I, though? - Because you're a good cop.

199
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,580
你怎麼知道？ 你告訴我的
- How do you know that? - You told me.

200
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:28,140
我若是好警員 我還會在這年紀擔任巡夜嗎？
If I'm such a good cop... How come I'm walkin' the beat, then, at my age?

201
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,260
你想告訴我嗎？
Do you want to tell me?

202
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,220
也許是我心地善良
Well, maybe I'm that Whore with a Heart of Gold.

203
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,510
罪惡圈裏唯一的好警員？ 你想聽這些嗎？
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town? Is that what you want to hear?

204
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,470
我沒要求你，我不在乎！
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

205
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,180
你要去巡夜就請便
You want to stay on the beat? You do that.

206
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,940
你願跟我一起嗎？ 我需要你的協助
If you'd like to come with me, I need your help.

207
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,650
我在請你幫忙
I'm askin' you for help.

208
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,620
你在害怕什麼？
Well...that's the thing you fear, isn't it?

209
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,960
奈斯先生，希望我在十年前 還有發福二十磅前就遇到你
Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you ten years and...twenty pounds ago.

210
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,050
但是，我覺得…
But...I just think it got...

211
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,530
對我較重要的便是保住老命
more important to me...to stay alive.

212
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,270
所以我甘心擔任巡夜
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.

213
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,810
謝謝，我不幹
Thank you, no.

214
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,410
很好，安迪
That's good, Andy.

215
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,910
開車吧，我們去兜風
Let's start up the thing and take a little ride.

216
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,580
我要聽一下 熊貓牌引擎的聲音！
I wanna hear that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!

217
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,090
好，讓我開車門 好的
- Yeah, let me open the door here. - Yeah, go ahead.

218
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,300
你快去把門撿起來，安迪
Whoopsy daisy, pick up the door there, Andy.

219
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,970
把它扔到後座讓我發動引擎
Throw it in the back seat. Now, let me get the thing started.

220
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,350
對，發動引擎吧
Yeah, start it up, Andy.

221
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,230
天啊！聽聽引擎聲！
Holy mackerel, Andy! Listen to that Bearcat motor!

222
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,860
是啊，聽起來就像大熊 不停追著小貓！
Yeah, it sounds like the bear is chasin' that cat all round it!

223
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,740
安迪，引擎過熱冒煙了！
Andy! She's boilin' over!

224
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,340
奈斯先生？ 什麼事
- Mr Ness? - Yes.

225
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,420
奧斯卡華萊士
Oscar Wallace.

226
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,510
華盛頓派我來的
I've been assigned here by the Washington Bureau.

227
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,220
真的？ 是的
- Really? - Yes.

228
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,520
我非常高興你加入 華萊士先生…對不起？
Well, I'm glad to have you here, Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?

229
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,570
我們現在一籌莫展 你有建議嗎…
We are a little in the dark here, but any ideas you may have...

230
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,730
是的，我有
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

231
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,400
我首先要試的便是這個
And the one I want to try first... is this.

232
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,120
他自1926年就沒有申報過
He has not filed a return since 1926.

233
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,710
申報？ 申報所得稅
- A return...? - An income tax return.

234
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,050
申報所得稅 是的，先生
- Income tax. - Yes, sir.

235
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,470
你在局裏是做什麼的 華萊士？
- What do you do at the Bureau?

236
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,090
我是會計
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

237
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,100
會計？ 是的，總局裏派我來此…
- An accountant? - Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

238
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,390
失陪了一下？
Would you excuse me?

239
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,860
坐吧
Please.

240
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,090
好了，我們走
Okay. Let's go.

241
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,890
去哪裏？ 這裏隔牆有耳
- Where are we going? - These walls have ears.

242
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,940
你說你想知道 如何扳倒卡彭
You said you wanted to know how to get Capone.

243
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,570
你真的要捉他？
Do you really want to get him? You see what I'm saying?

244
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,950
你明白我的意思？ 你打算怎麼做？
- What are you prepared to do? - Everything within the law.

245
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,430
合法的行動 若不成，你又有何打算？
And then what are you prepared to do?

246
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,250
奈斯先生 如果你打算向他們開戰
If you open the ball on these people,

247
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,620
你就要一直戰鬥下去
you must be prepared to go all the way.

248
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,210
因為他們非和你拚個 你死我活不可
Because they won't give up the fight until one of you is dead.

249
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,300
我想捉卡彭 我不知該如何下手
I want to get Capone. I don't know how.

250
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,090
要捉卡彭，就要比他強
Here's how you get Capone:

251
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
他拔刀，你就拔搶
he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

252
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,260
他傷了你的部下 你就宰了他的爪牙！
He sends one of yours to hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!

253
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,140
那就是芝加哥的規則！ 那就是捉卡彭的方法！
That's the Chicago way! And that's how you get Capone.

254
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,400
你能那樣幹嗎？
Now, do you want to do that?

255
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,900
你準備好那樣干了嗎？
Are you ready to do that?

256
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,030
我提供你這個建議 你要不要接受？
I'm making you a deal. Do you want this deal?

257
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,870
我已發誓要將他繩之以法！
I have sworn to put this man away,

258
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,580
以合法手段 盡我所能去達成
with any and all legal means at my disposal, and I will do so.

259
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,840
天主憎惡懦夫
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

260
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,890
你可瞭解血誓之意義，奈斯先生？
Do you know what a blood oath is, Mr Ness?

261
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,650
是的 很好，你剛剛才發了一個血誓
- Yes. - Good. 'Cause you just took one.

262
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,400
你明白那晚的突襲 何以不成功？
How do you think Capone knew about your raid the other night?

263
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,160
有人通風報信 對，你開竅了
- Somebody on the cops told him. - Right. Welcome to Chicago.

00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,490
什麼都不是 什麼都不是
Nothing

399
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,220
你瞭解嗎？我想沒有人可以
You follow me? No one.

400
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,290
晴朗的天氣看台上的球迷爆滿 他得說些什麼呢？
Sunny day, the stands are full of fans. What does he have to say?

401
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,380
我要自己出去
I'm goin' out there for myself.

402
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,680
但是…我哪都去不了…
But...I get nowhere

403
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,720
…除非我的球隊贏了
unless the team wins.

404
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,310
團隊！團隊！
- Team! - Team.

405
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,150
上帝！
Jesus Christ!

406
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,340
現在我躺下休息了
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

407
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,930
祈禱上帝保佑我的靈魂
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

408
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,100
如果醒來前我死去了
'lf I should die before I wake'

409
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,390
祈禱上帝把我的靈魂帶走
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

410
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,690
阿門！上帝保佑你
- Amen. - God bless...

411
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,400
上帝保佑媽媽，上帝保佑爸爸 上帝保佑玩具娃娃，阿門
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie, God bless Daddy. Amen.

412
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,860
阿門
Amen.

413
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,450
晚安 晚安
Good night.

414
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,750
晚安，爸爸 晚安，小女孩
- Good night, Daddy. - Good night, little girl.

415
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,000
想去惹惱愛斯基摩人嗎？小蝴蝶？
Want to rub Eskimo? Butterfly?

416
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,260
你想去哪兒？ 什麼？
- Where are you going? - What?

417
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,640
你想去哪兒？
Where are you going?

418
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,690
我想去樓下 明天有事兒要做
I thought I'd go downstairs, some work to do for tomorrow.

419
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,030
今天你工作了一整天，是嗎？ 是的，當然
- You had a full day today, though? - Yes, I certainly did.

420
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,500
你還有精力？ 噢，一大堆工作要做
And you've still got some energy left? Oh, a lot of work.

421
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:59,200
不過，你為什麼不上來幫我梳頭 我的偵探？
Well, why don't you come up and brush my hair? You 'Detective'

422
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,250
（十字軍警察分隊終於得分）

423
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,220
我們該怎麼做？
- How are we doin'

424
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,050
艾爾卡邦的組織狡詐 令人難以置信
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

425
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,640
看這個 它擁有加拿大控股公司協會
It owns Canadian Holding Company Associations, which owns in turn

426
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,930
該協會又擁有綠燈洗衣店
Green Light Laundry,

427
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,560
中西部計程車公司 歡樂時光玩具…
Midwest Cabs, Jolly Time Playthings...

428
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,440
歡樂時光玩具？ 是的，歡樂時光玩具？
- Jolly Time Playthings? - Yes.

429
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,190
提醒我給我女兒買一份禮物
Remind me to get a present for my daughter.

430
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,240
巴哈馬船運公司、露西小姐… 這清單沒完沒了！
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore, Miss Lucy Togs...the list is endless!

431
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,950
所有的生意都是合法的 並且它們都不屬於艾爾卡邦
And all the business is legitimate, and none is owned by Al Capone.

432
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,450
但是我們能以逃稅逮捕他 如果我們能查明
But we can get him on income tax evasion if we can show

433
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,420
那些組織業務的錢都流向他
that any of the 'organisation' business money is going to him.

434
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,040
從法律上來說，他沒有收入 他沒有獲得任何東西？
- Legally, he receives no income. - He doesn't receive anything?

435
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,090
打擾一下，奈斯先生 你有訪客
- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.

436
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,920
奈斯先生 我是奈斯
- Mister Ness!

437
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,430
我想知道我們能否談一會兒？
Could we talk for a minute?

438
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,180
43區市政議員約翰奧辛
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

439
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,180
是的，市政議員 我知道你是誰
Yes, I know who you are.

440
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,060
可以讓我們獨處嗎？
Would you excuse us?

441
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,810
我們手上有幾各大案子正在進行
We are busy with several large operations.

442
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,770
我們相當忙，市政議員 那麼，我能為您做些什麼呢？
What can I do for you?

443
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,190
我來祝賀你工作幹的漂亮
I came up to congratulate you on a job well done.

444
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:21,080
所以在如此美好的一天 特地來分享您的好運
Share your good fortune on such a lovely day.

445
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,540
這是什麼意思？
What's that?

446
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,550
什麼？ 先生，您是受過教育的人
- What is that? - Mr Ness, you're an educated man.

447
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,920
我們可以坦率地交談
Let me pay you the compliment of being blunt.

448
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,640
您正在破壞樁一大生意
There is a large and popular business which you are causing dismay.

449
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,730
為什麼您不能順應時勢 順其自然？
Why don't you just cross the street and let things take their course?

450
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,070
請進好嗎？
Would you come in here, please?

451
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,280
在羅馬時期
In Roman times,

452
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,330
當某人因試圖賄賂政府官員 而被定罪時
when a fellow tried to bribe a public official,

453
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,740
人們會割掉他的鼻子 並且將他和一個野獸
they would cut off his nose, sew him in a bag

454
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,620
縫在一個袋子裏 並把袋子扔進河裏
with a wild animal, and throw that bag in the river.

455
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,040
告訴你的負責人 我們不相為謀！
You tell your master that we must agree to...disagree!

456
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,800
你正在犯一個大錯誤
- You're making a mistake.

457
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,840
是嗎？我之前已經犯過錯誤 現在我正在享受
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

458
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,590
你的同伴是鐵面無私的 有這回事嗎？
You fellows are 'untouchable' is that it?

459
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,850
沒人能說得動你？
No one can get to you?

460
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,520
你告訴卡邦… 嘿，每個人都能接近
You tell Capone...

461
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,640
…我將在地獄見他
that I'll see him in hell.

462
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,520
嘿！真漂亮的房子！我說 真漂亮的房子！你住在這兒？
Hey! Nice house! I said, nice house! Do you live there?

463
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,400
呵，小女孩要過生日了？
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

464
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,510
是的 有一個家庭真不錯
Yes. Nice to have a family.

465
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,250
是的，的確是
Yes, it is.

466
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,420
一家之主可要當心 保證沒有什麼事會發生
A man should take care, see that nothin' happens to them.

467
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,890
凱瑟琳！
Catherine?!

468
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,310
凱瑟琳！
Catherine!

469
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,570
孩子在哪兒？ 她在樓上，艾略特！
- Where's the baby? - She's upstairs. Eliot!

470
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,700
不
No

471
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,410
噢，你
Oh,you

472
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,080
你剛才在做什麼？ 我必須把衣服燙好
- What were you doing up? - I had to finish my ironing.

473
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,420
真的？
You did?

474
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,380
你現在跟爸爸來，好嗎？
You're gonna come with Daddy now, okay?

475
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,480
艾略特？好的，沒問題！
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

476
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,020
好的，我們走
Okay, let's go.

477
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,070
站住！走在路上要當心
Stay there! Keep your eye on the street!

478
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,950
馬龍在哪兒？ 在監視，他馬上就到
- Where's Malone? - On the stake-out. He'll be here.

479
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,780
這小子是誰？
- Who's this guy?

480
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,950
他是名單上的一個人 沒事
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

481
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,750
那麼好吧 送他們到車站
Drive to the station.

482
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,710
當你去那兒時 她會告訴你往哪兒去
She'll let you know where to go when you get there.

483
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,540
是，長官 脫帽
Take off your hat.

484
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,960
如果有什麼事發生，先開槍 明白我的意思嗎？
Anything happens, shoot first. You understand me?

485
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,630
是的，奈斯先生
Yes, Mr Ness.

486
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,260
親親
Kiss.

487
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,520
愛斯基摩人和小蝴蝶，爸爸 好的
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad. - Okay.

488
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,600
現在，出發！
Now, go!

489
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,800
馬龍！
Malone!

490
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,590
他們平安嗎？ 一切平安
- Are they okay? - Yeah.

491
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,050
你們確定那個警員很好嗎？ 嗯，他最好是，他是我的表兄弟
- You sure the cop's okay? - He'd better be, he's my cousin.

492
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,680
我想解決他，馬龍！ 你聽見我說的嗎？
I want to hurt the man, Malone! You hear me?!

493
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,680
我要開始和他周旋 我要解決卡邦
I want to take the battle to him. I want to hurt Capone.

494
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,400
那麼好吧，耶誕節快樂 因為我有些好消息告訴他
Well, then, a Merry Christmas, we've got some great news.

495
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,060
會有一個大型的國際運輸經過
A huge international shipment's coming.

496
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,230
我們知道時間、地點和整個情況
We've got the time, the place and the whole shebang.

497
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,740
好吧 那麼我們還站在這裏幹嘛？
Well, what are we doin' standin' here, then?

498
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:33,680
你怎麼得知這個消息的？ 這是警員工作的第二條規則
How do you come by this information? That's the second rule of police work:

499
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,580
如果你想保密 就不要告訴老闆
if you want to keep a secret, don't tell the boss.

500
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,260
你知道他每年賺 超過3百萬美金嗎？
You know he's making over $3 million a year?

501
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,090
但他從來不納稅 什麼都不在他名下
But he's paid no taxes, nothing's in his name.

502
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,340
要是我們能查清他的任何收入
If we can establish any payments to him,

503
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,890
我們就可以起訴他 逃避繳納所得稅
we can prosecute him for income tax evasion.

504
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,220
什麼？
What?

505
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,310
我說，我們可以起訴他 逃避繳納所得稅
I said, we can prosecute him for income tax evasion!

506
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,110
以稅務來治裁一個殺人犯？
Try a murderer for not paying his taxes?!

507
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,030
好吧，總比什麼都不做要好
Well, it's better than nothing.

508
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,070
好吧 那我們怎麼把他和錢聯繫上呢？
All right. How do we link him to the money?

509
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,780
我不知道
I don't know.

510
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,410
睡覺吧，奧斯卡
Go to sleep, Oscar.

511
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,340
一個5到10輛卡車的車隊 裝滿上好的加拿大威士忌
A convoy of 5-10 trucks with good Canadian whiskey

512
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,760
將會由卡邦組織 一個高層成員接頭
will be met by a high-level member of the Capone organisation.

513
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,600
他將以全額現金一次付清
He will be bringing full payment for the shipment in cash.

514
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,730
這交易將會就發生在美國的邊境內
Now, the meet is to take place just over the border on the American side.

515
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,560
我們的目標是要沒收現金和酒
We want to confiscate the liquor and the cash.

516
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:29,440
上尉？ 我們等著他們的信號
- Captain? - We will await their signal.

517
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,740
當他們在路上 並發出信號時
When they're on the road and have given the signal,

518
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,490
我們就從加拿大的橋邊衝出
we will engage from the Canadian side of the bridge.

519
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,740
然後從後方突襲他們
Thus taking them by surprise from the rear.

520
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,250
奈斯先生，你應當非常清楚 出其不意是成功的一半
And surprise, as you very well know, Mr Ness, is half the battle.

521
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,040
突襲是成功的一半 很多事情都是
Surprise is half the battle. Many things are half the battle.

522
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,630
失敗是成功的一半 讓我們想想什麼是全勝
Losing is half the battle. Let's think about what is all the battle.

523
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,820
讓我們出征，同胞們！ 謝謝你，上尉
Let's take the fight to them, gentlemen! Thank you, Captain.

524
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,270
好的！出發！
All right! Move out!

525
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,580
別緊張
Take it easy.

526
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,830
別緊張遲早會發生的
Take it easy! lt'll all happen in time.

527
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,090
這就是工作
This is the job.

528
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,420
別等著它發生 甚至不要想著它發生
Don't wait for it to happen, don't even want it to happen.

529
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,390
就看看發生了什麼
Just watch what does happen.

530
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,390
你是我的導師嗎？
Are you my 'tutor'?

531
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,680
是的，先生，我正是
Yes, sir, that I am.

532
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,730
你已經察看過？ 是的
- Did you check it already? - Yes, I did.

533
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,400
然後順其自然
Then leave it alone.

534
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,570
你是一個好警員，吉塞普
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

535
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,990
你做得很好！你會做得正好
You're doing good. You're gonna do just fine.

536
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,750
華萊士，你冷嗎？ 是的，有一點
- Wallace, are you cold? - Yes, I am, a little.

537
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,920
跺跺你的腳，那樣會暖和些
Then stamp your feet. It'll keep you warm.

538
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,460
你有點經驗了 路遙知馬力
You learn something, 20 years walking the beat.

539
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,590
打小報告和站在雨中…
Stitches and standing in the rain...

540
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,670
聽著，奈斯先生…
Listen, Mr Ness...

541
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,750
我有一個主意
I had an idea.

542
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,770
你們都只有少量的子彈？
You all have your spare shells?

543
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:09,370
如果你們必須開火 拿低點並找出空間
If you have to fire, hold low and squeeze.

544
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,000
放倒他
And put your man down.

545
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,110
因為他將會同樣對待你 擊斃他
Because he'll do the same to you. Shoot to kill.

546
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,510
你聽見我說的話嗎？ 是的，擊斃他
- Did you hear what I said? - Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

547
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,640
走吧
Let's go.

548
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,710
放鬆…
Easy...

549
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,290
那些加拿大人不會出現的 直到我晃動徽章
The Canadians will not show until I flash the badge.

550
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,050
所以我們必須穿過地面 迅速到達那座橋
So we must cover the ground to the bridge as quickly as possible.

551
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,340
喬治，看起來估計是正確的
George, the count's right.

552
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,470
我關心的不是計數 是酒桶的大小
I'm concerned about the size of these barrels!

553
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,720
馬龍，你和我將要…
Malone, you and I will take the men...

554
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,520
阻止那…
Stop it!

555
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,480
移開它！移開它 喬治！快點！
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

556
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,600
到那邊去！ 蓋住卡車！
Get over here!

557
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,270
丟掉那些東西！
Leave the stuff in the cars!

558
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,610
衝啊！
Charge!

559
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,700
什麼鬼東西！ 你最終會死於某種疾病
What the hell! You got to die of somethin'

560
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,620
看！他們來了！ 他媽的條子！我們走！
- Look! Here they come! - Mounties! Let's get out of here!

561
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,180
讓我們離開這兒！快！ 快離開！
Move, move!

562
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,090
走！
Let's go!

563
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,510
我簡直不敢相信！
I can't believe it!

564
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,930
這裏！這本賬簿！ 把它給我
- Here are the codes. - Give me that.

565
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,890
不要讓車離開橋！
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

566
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,310
掩護他！ 走！
Cove him!GAO

567
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,530
喬治史東，跑到車那兒去！
run to the car

568
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,660
史東，乘坐第一輛車！ 知道了！
Stone, take the first car!

569
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,040
把這東西扔一邊去
Get this shit out of the way!

570
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,350
我們走！ 走！快，開槍！
Let's  go,go!Fire!

571
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,860
硬漢！
Tough guy!

572
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,990
史東！
Stone!

573
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,650
走！
Go!

574
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,950
史東！
Stone!

575
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,490
我很好
I'm okay.

576
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,000
你們這些暴徒！
You thugs!

577
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,220
你還好嗎？
You all right?

578
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,930
是的，他在那兒 去把他弄過來！
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

579
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,830
好的！真夠倒霉的！
All right! Enough of this running shit!

580
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,160
好了，喬治史東！ 我們得到了什麼？
Well, Georgie-boy! Well, what have we got here?

581
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,920
嗨
Hello.

582
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,920
好的！放下槍！
All right! Drop the gun!

583
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,340
舉起手來，你們被捕了
Put your hands in the air, you're under arrest.

584
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,460
我說，放下槍！
I said, drop it!

585
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,300
不許動！
Stop!

586
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,430
老天，難道你沒聽見我說的嗎？
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

587
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,980
你們是聾子嗎？
What are you, deaf?!

588
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,230
這是什麼，鬧劇嗎？
What is this, a game?!

589
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,220
這裏，坐下
Here. Sit down.

590
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,890
好啦，史東會好的
Stone's gonna be all right.

591
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,730
我抓到帶著挎包的小子
I got the fellow with the satchel.

592
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,780
我要殺了他 噢，是的
- I had to kill him. - Oh, yeah.

593
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,830
他已經死了
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

594
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:27,120
你想死嗎？ 不，我不想
- Would you rather it was you? - No, I would not.

595
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:30,420
好啦，你們已經盡責了 回家吧，今晚好好睡一覺
Well, then you've done your duty. Go home and sleep well tonight.

596
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,220
好吧，事情你都看見了 當你出外沒帶槍的後果
The things you see when you're out without your gun.

597
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,640
喂，史東 你從遙遠的南方來的吧
Now you're a long way from the Southside, George.

598
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,800
我在跟你說話
I'm talkin' to you.

599
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,810
你來這兒是為了開 一個射擊場嗎？
Did you come here to open a shooting gallery?

600
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,690
我要你寫出 你上司和聯繫人的名字
I want you to write down the names of your superiors and contacts.

601
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,810
你為什麼不供奉我的屁股 嘿！
Why don't you kiss my ass?

602
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,270
好的，你可能沒聽見我說什麼 艾略特奈斯？
- Perhaps you didn't hear me. - Eliot?

603
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,860
你朝聯邦警官開火 你們犯法了
- You've broken the law... - Eliot!

604
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,990
你會在Levanworth裏艱難地蹲上30 年
You can be tough in Leavenworth for 30 years.

605
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,950
你們將要成天待在裏面！ 那就是你們想要的嗎？
- You're going inside for all day! - Is that what you want?

606
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,620
艾略特奈斯！ 什麼？
- Eliot! - What?!

607
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,330
看！
Look at this!

608
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,910
看這個！ 這是什麼？
- Look at this! - What is this?

609
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,130
這是什麼？
What is this?

610
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,510
在這本賬簿裏 有很多金錢交易
You got a lot of money changing hands in this book.

611
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,470
這是什麼，「行政區」 和「警員管區」？
What is this, 'war'? And 'police precincts'

612
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,220
這裏有一個標題「巡迴法庭」
And you got a heading here... 'Circuit Court'

613
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,650
這裏有一個標題「巡迴法庭」 這是什麼？
You got a heading here, 'Circuit Court' What is this?

614
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,730
沒什麼 你們沒什麼可利用的
Nothin' There's nothin' you can make out of it.

615
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,190
如果我們能確定任何編碼 賬目是指給卡邦的付款
If any of these coded entries indicate payment to Capone,

616
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,150
那我們就可以處理卡邦了
then we can put Capone away.

617
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,410
我要你告訴我們 哪個賬目是艾爾卡邦的
- Which entry is Al Capone?

618
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,240
寇斯塔，是卡邦的代號嗎？
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

619
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,990
你要在監獄裏過一輩子 除非你和我們合作，老兄
You'll do the whole thing in the joint unless you help us.

620
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,540
我要你說明這個賬簿
Translate this ledger for us!

621
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,540
在地獄裏 在地獄？
- In hell. - In hell?!

622
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:55,630
你會搞砸一切，老兄 你會被吊死，除非你和我們合作
You will hang high unless you cooperate.

623
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,340
這個人可以指證艾爾卡邦 這個人能把艾爾卡邦送進監獄
This man can finger Al Capone, put him behind bars.

624
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,260
為什麼你們不他媽的滾蛋
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

625
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,720
我沒有瞎干涉你 哈德凱斯先生！
I'm not fuckin' with you!

626
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,060
無論如何， 我們必須得到這些資訊
We'll have that information one way or another.

627
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,270
可不是那邊，出去 你可以說話了！
- Not that way. Out. - You're gonna talk!

628
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,150
你會求我們讓你說！ 總會有人說的！
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

629
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,530
你狗娘養的 夠了你們，滾出去
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch! - Enough out of you.

630
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,490
嘿，你快來，走過來！
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

631
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,030
我需要你幫我們說明這本賬簿
I need you to help me to translate this book!

632
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,200
我不會要求第二次
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

633
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,250
我數到三
I'm gonna count to three.

634
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,000
怎麼？你嘴裏有把槍不能說話嗎？
What's the matter? Can't you talk with a gun in your mouth?

635
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,630
一
One.

636
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,640
二
Two!

637
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,640
三！
Three.

638
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,850
我說！
I'm gonna talk!

639
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,940
不要！你們想知道的一切事情 我都會一五一十的告訴你
Don't ! I'm gonna tell ya whatever ya want.

640
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,440
你們想要知道些什麼？
What do ya want to know?

641
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,570
在他講話之前 不要讓他替自己澄清
Now, don't let him clean himself until after he talks.

642
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,700
問問他你想知道事情
Now, ask him what you want to know.

643
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,620
好吧…
All right...

644
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,870
好，我要知道會計的名字
Okay, I want to know the name of the bookkeeper.

645
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,460
我要這些密碼的完整譯本
I want a complete translation of the code.

646
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,420
我要完整的資訊
I want a complete...

647
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,250
奈斯先生！
Mister Ness!

648
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,260
那麼，寇斯塔，是艾爾卡邦嗎？

649
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,050
是艾爾卡邦

650
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,300
我不贊同你的方法
I do not approve of your methods!

651
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,180
是嗎？那麼，你不是芝加哥人
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

652
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,480
什麼？ 他們的貨到手了
- What? - They got the shipment.

653
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,940
什麼？ 他們得到了所有的貨了
- What?! - They got the whole shipment.

654
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,780
我要那個狗娘養的給我馬上死！ 我們正試圖找到…
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead! - We're trying to locate...

655
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,120
我是什麼，如此孤立無援？ 我有問過你想幹什麼嗎？
What am I, alone in this world? Did I ask you what you're tryin' to do?

656
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,870
不，艾爾卡邦，請不要這樣
No, Al Capone.

657
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,750
我要你找到這個雜種！
I want you to get this fuck where he breathes!

658
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,750
我要你找到那個叫 艾略特奈斯的娘娘腔
I want Eliot Ness dead!

659
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,130
我要他死！我要他全家死盡！
I want his family dead,

660
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,090
我要他的房子燒成平地！
his house burnt to the ground!

661
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,630
我要在半夜跑到那裏 在他的骨灰上撒尿！
I want to piss on his ashes!

662
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:08,140
看看這傢伙，這傢伙 他太可惡了
Look at this guy, this guy, he's so serious.

663
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,430
很好，他已經煩惱了好長時間 他？
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind. - He does?

664
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,600
是的 比如？
- Yes. - Like what?

665
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,850
比如說他的名字
Like what his name is.

666
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,480
「約翰福特」 我還認為一切都解決了
John, I thought that was all settled.

667
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,480
「約翰福特」，我覺得 我們喜歡「約翰福特」
I thought we liked John.

668
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,490
我猜想他的中間名字 應該是「羅」
I suppose his middle name will be Law.

669
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:27,910
不，是「愛德格」
No...it'll be Edgar.

670
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:33,080
應該是「傑愛德格」 我不這麼認為
- It'll be J. Edgar... - I don't think so.

671
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,040
老天，你真美麗
God, you're beautiful.

672
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,670
你昨晚就應該來看看我們的
You should have seen us last night.

我知道 我想過本來就應該到這裏的
I know. I should have been here. I wanted to be here.

我知道我明白，我懂
I know. I understand, I do.

675
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:56,490
告訴我，你一直都很小心嗎？ 比老鼠還要小心啊
Just tell me, are you being careful?

676
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,150
你有進展嗎？
- Careful as mice. - Are you making progress?

677
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,400
進展？ 有
- Progress? - Yes?

678
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,360
夫人，我覺得您的丈夫 已經找到了艾爾卡邦
Mrs Ness, I think your husband just became the man who got Al Capone.

679
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,080
先生們，有傳訊傳過來了
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued for Alphonse Capone

680
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:23,380

and conspiring to evade Federal Income Tax.

682
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,680
卡邦的罪行能有多大？
- What's the maximum he could get? - If convicted on all counts,

683
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,060
如果所有的罪名成立 可以讓卡邦蹲28年的監獄
Mr Capone could have up to 28 years.

684
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,520
殺人犯？ 不好意思，我知道的就這麼多
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

685
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,740
好，現在出發 車在巷子裏
The car's in the yard.

686
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,910
當你把他帶到那裏時 不要接電話
When ya get him there, don't answer the phone.

687
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,240
我們將通知你，手機會響 兩次
- We'll call, let it ring... - Twice.

688
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,990
我們將在… 在角落

689
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,950
誰要是敲門… 我明白，立刻斃了他
- Anybody knocks on the door... - Come out shooting.

690
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,960
你明白了？ 是的
I got it.

691
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,920
你非常喜歡執法的戰略方面 那是奧斯卡華萊士嗎？
You enjoy the tactical aspects of law enforcement, Oscar?

692
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,920
哦，是的它比賬本有趣多了
Much more diverting than accounting.

693
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,260
我們對你有好處 你對我們也有好處
I'm bein' good to you, you got to be good to me.

694
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,720
我們來達成一個協定 我們大家都遵守，可以麼？
We made a deal, we're gonna stick to it, okay?

695

恩，是，比作賬有趣多了

很好，一路順風，永不止步
All right, all the way down and no stops.

698
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,870
…他能說，「我將毫無保留」
...he's been saying, "I will speak up."

699
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:43,790
在此我一定要讚揚 艾略特奈斯
For which I must commend the excellent work

700
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,840
和他的鐵面無私小組的 出色工作
of Eliot Ness and his squad of Untouchables.

701
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,720
是男孩或女孩？ 男孩
- What was it, a boy or a girl? - Boy.

702
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,800

01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,520
那麼她還好嗎？ 恩，她還好
- So she's okay? - Yeah, she's okay.

706
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,980
實際上，當她離開時 她想重新粉刷整個房子
In fact, when she gets out, she wants to repaint the house.

707
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:09,150
當粉刷完了，她會發現房子 變得很小了，所以你得搬家
Then she'll find the house too small, you'll have to move.

708
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,950
完全正確
excatly

709
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:15,700
老天，結婚是一件美好的事 如果你能忍受這樣的痛苦
- Goodness, it's nice to be married. - If you can stand the pain.

710
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,990
伯恩斯先生，你知道 華萊士先生在哪裏嗎？
Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?

711
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,160
你難道沒有看到他嗎？ 他剛從服務電梯裏下去了
Didn't you see him? He just went down in the service elevator.

712
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,580
好的，很好
Well good

713
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,340
你能在任何時候眼觀八方… 放鬆點，一切都會好起來的
- You keep an eye out at all times... - Take it easy, we'll be fine.

714
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,170
他們要派人…

你還好吧？
You gonna be all right?

725
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,470
奈斯先生…
Mr Ness

726
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,650
當一個年輕的傢伙在這條 線路中壞事，這就是犯罪了
It's always a crime when a young guy goes down in the line, Jimmy.

727
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,200
我討厭看到它發生 在我認識的人身上
I'd hate to see it happen to someone I know.

728
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,830
有時最好不要介入
Sometimes it's better not to get involved.

729
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,620
吉米馬龍

730
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:10,160

Take a day off. Get out of the city for a while.

731
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,420
你明白我的意思嗎？
You know what I mean?

你想在這裏做什麼嗎？ 今天我朋友被殺了
- Something you want here? - My friend was killed today.

738
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,040
我不介意 你不在乎
- I don't care. - You don't care.

739
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,130
可是他現在已經這樣了
Now he does.

740
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,250
卡邦，出來 你想打架嗎？
Come on here, Capone. You want to fight?

就這樣，來吧！
That's it, come on!

743
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,220
你害怕從保鏢中走出來 為自己說話？
You afraid to come out from behind your men, to stand up for yourself?

744
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,600

在我兒子面前 你竟敢這麼跟我說話？
You talk to me like that in front of my son?

748
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,190
操，操你全家！
Fuck you and your family!

749
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:23,130
放鬆點，是我！不是這邊 不是這邊
Easy. It's me. It's me! Not this way.

750
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,870
你操來操去，什麼都沒得到 你只會說大話
You fuck, you got nothin' You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

751
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:28,790
正因你沒得到，所以你在這 在法庭上你什麼都沒得到
You're here because you got nothin' in court,

752
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:31,040
你沒有抓到那個會計 你什麼都沒得到！

753
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,670

If you were a man, you would've done it now!

754
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,460
一無所獲，你個廢物！
You got nothin' you punk!

755
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,760

757
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:00,940
好吧，發生什麼事了？

他說他不能不受到保護
He says he can't be unprotected.

759
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,740
那個傢伙說了什麼？
What is it that the guy says?

760
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,290
他說 他不會讓自己做愚蠢的事情
He says he won't make a fool out of himself,

761
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:19,040
沒有證人他也不會出庭的
and he won't go into court without a witness.

762
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:23,260

We have Wallace's files and the ledgers.

766
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:33,060
有時候重新考量損失是必要的
There's a time when I think you have to cut your losses.

767
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,520

- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti... - I think that's enough for today.

783
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,220
什麼？ 你聽的沒錯
- I'm sorry? - You heard me.

784

我的問題是，我們結束了嗎？
My question is, are we done?

785

是的，我認為我們結束了
Yes, I think we're done.

786
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,350
你說我們現在正處於一場苦戰？
So we sat in at a game that was above our head?

787
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,070
似乎是這樣 對於華萊士先生也是這樣
It appears so. It appears so to Mr Wallace.

788
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:06,570
反正他死了 而且那個混蛋也準備和解
He's dead! And the D.A. is gonna drop the case!

789
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,990
該死的，沒有證人他不會出庭
He will not go into court without a witness

790
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:12,070
而且沒有卡邦的會計 沃爾特佩恩，他也不會出庭
and without Capone's bookkeeper, Walter Payne.

791
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,870
那你現在準備做什麼？ 你想讓我做什麼？
- What are you prepared to do now? - What would you have me do?

792
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,460
我已經盡可能地做了
I have taken this as far as it can go.

793
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,100
你老婆想要什麼？ 她想知道，如果我…
- What did your wife want? - She wanted to know if I was...

794
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,890
我老婆？ 是啊
- My wife? - Yeah.

795
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,610
她想知道我是否是對的
She wanted to know if I was all right.

796
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,360
結婚不錯吧，啊？
It's nice being married, eh?

797
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,200
是啊
Yes.

798
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:59,910
她正坐在某個房間 被一群陌生人包圍著
She's sitting in some room surrounded by people she doesn't know,

799
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,250
仔細檢查著… 廚房彩色圖片什麼的
going over... kitchen colour charts or something.

800
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,510
世界上的某些人依舊關心著 廚房的顏色是什麼
Some part of the world still cares what colour the kitchen is.

801
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:25,440
艾略特奈斯，我還想你為我 再做一件事
Eliot, I want you to do one more thing for me.

802
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,440
你回DA那裏去並且拖住他
Get back to the D.A. and stall him.

803
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,160
等等，拖住他？ 怎麼拖住他？
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?

804
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,280
照我說的做就行了
- Just do as I say.

805
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,040
我想我知道怎麼樣找到那個傢伙
I think I know how to find this guy.

806
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,250
（卡邦會計應訊）

807
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,790
沃爾特佩恩？
Walter?

808
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,630
艾爾卡邦說，在他解決傳訊之後 我們才能離開這座城市
Al says we got to get out of town until he can fix this subpoena thing.

809
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,380
我們今晚就出發
We're leavin' tonight.

810
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,260
兩球入袋
Two ball, down.

811
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:10,710
麥克，你有時間嗎？ 嗯，我現在有，不是嗎？
Mike, you got a minute? I do now, don't I?

812
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,070
吉姆馬龍，你現在 在警員隊伍裏做什麼？
And what are you doin' in a club for cops, Jimmy?

813
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:21,430
這是警員的地方 我們能夠借一步說話嗎？
This is a place for cops. Can we step outside?

814
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,000
可以，可以，當然可以 但我沒有什麼要對你說的
All right, all right, but I got nothin' to say to ya.

815
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,380
我們到底要去哪裏 游泳嗎？
Where the hell are we going, for a swim?

816
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:35,050
傻瓜，不要淋雨啊
Get out of the rain, you fool.

817
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,140
什麼？什麼？
What? What?!

818
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:44,060
我只是需要再一個資訊
I just need one more piece of information.

819
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,310
再一個？吉姆馬龍！
One more? Jimmy!

820
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,230
我只為了你冒生命危險 我需要找到那個會計
- I just risked my life for ya. - I need to find that bookkeeper.

821
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:55,860
你瘋了嗎？你是瘋了
Are you crazy? Y ou're crazy.

822
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,860
我警告過你必須 得離開這個城市
I warned you to get out of town.

823
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:02,870
若他們知道是我，我死定了 我需要找到那個會計
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead. - I need to find that bookkeeper.

824
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,710
你他媽的胡說八道，老兄！ 你真他媽的瘋了！
You're fuckin' nuts, man! You're out of your fuckin' mind!

825
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:10,100
你真的瘋了！ 我救過你的命
And I tried to save your life.

826
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,210
放開你的手
Get your hands off.

827
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,720
你欠我的，吉姆.馬龍 我不欠你任何東西
You owe me, Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'

828
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,090
我的人都被殺了 你的人？我們才是你的人啊！
- My people are being killed. - We're your people!

829
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,550
你們是我的人？ 是啊
You?!

830
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,600
你他媽的和外人一起混啊！ 麥克，他們已經毀了這個城市
You fuckin' run with the dagos! They've ruined this town.

831
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:28,520
十年來我因這些事吃不下飯 不斷告訴自己我是一個警員
For ten years I can't say that I'm a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

832
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:33,520
啊，廢話！真他媽的廢話！ 看看你自己！看看你自己！
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit! Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

833
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:41,910
帶上你舒適的衣服和聯邦 傀儡生活在你的遊戲里
Go on and live the charade, with your soft clothes and federal stooges.

834
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,620
你認為他到底要做什麼？
- What do you think he's gonna do?

835
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,870
閉上你的嘴！ 他要剷平這座城市嗎？
- Keep your mouth off that!

836
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,290
我要知道這個傢伙在哪裏 而且我現在必須馬上知道！
I need to know where this guy is, and I need to know now!

837
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:54,000

841
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:03,970
你死了
You're dead.

842
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,500
你認為你自己算老幾啊？
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

843
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,670
早上我要把你的屁股 掛在旗桿上
I'll have your ass hangin' from the flagpole in the mornin'

844
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,010
我們中斷這個話題吧，老兄
Let's cut the woofing, pal.

845
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,140
你要告訴我
You tell me,

846
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,350
否則醫院和 太平間正等著你！
or you're going to hospital or the fuckin' morgue!

847
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,180
老天 你一定要幫助我達成任務
You're gonna fight it out and we'll have a case.

848
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,980
什麼？憑什麼？我不會 陷入困境或愚弄…
Yes? On what basis? I'm not gonna make a fool...

849
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:56,650
先生，不要告訴我 你要自作愚蠢
Don't tell me about makin' a fool out of yourself.

850
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,320
我已經安排了一些人在那裏 他們冒的風險比那個大多了
I have men out there risking more than that.

851
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,900
而且我被告知 那兒有一個帶路的
We have a lead, and we are following that lead

852
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:05,660
我們冒險跟著這個引導 危險大多了
at risk to more than our standing.

853
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,280
所以你現在還敢停止嗎
So don't you dare stop now.

854
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,370
是的，史東 我要奈斯
- Yeah, Stone. - Give me Ness.

855
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,500
他不在這裏，他在那個DA那裏 發生什麼事情？
He's at the D.A. 's.

856
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,170
告訴他我知道佩恩在哪裏 並馬上來我住的地方找我
Tell him I know where Payne is and to meet me at my place.

857
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:37,420
阿爾.卡邦！阿爾.卡邦！ 卡邦先生！
- Al! Al! - Mr Capone!

858
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,940
怎麼樣了… 那個案子怎麼樣了？
- What about that court case?

859
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,150
我會告訴你一些情況

860
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,490
有人整我 我也要整他
Somebody messes with me, I'm gonna mess with him.

861
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:50,370
有些人向我行竊 我就說，「你偷東西」
Somebody steals from me, I'm gonna say 'you stole'

862
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,540
和他講話 可不是因為在人行道上吐痰
not talk to him for spittin' on the sidewalk.

863
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,710
你明白了嗎？
You understand?

864
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:00,750
現在我沒有做任何事情 傷害這些人
Now, I have done nothing to hurt these people.

865
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,800
但是他們都很生我的氣 所以，他們做了些什麼？
But they're angered at me. So what do they do?

866
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:08,430
醫生沒有病患，所以過來繳收入稅…
Doctor up some income tax, for which they got no case,

867
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,890

868
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,270
像正常人那樣和我講話？不

去騷擾一個安靜的人
To harass a peaceful man.

870
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,070
如果我曾經是個罪人 我請求上帝原諒我
I pray to God that if I ever have a grievance,

871
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,320
我只是想要 更多的一點自尊
I would have just a little more self respect.

872
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,160
卡邦先生！卡邦先生！ 只是還有一個問題！
Mr Capone!Mr Capone!

873
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,490
我想還告訴你一件事情

（拉辛路1634號）

877
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,250
這難道不像美國的那些黑人嗎？
Isn't that just like a wop?

878
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,170
在槍戰上帶刀

I don't understand it. What does Capone have?

990
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:45,770
我們把他逼到絕路 而他卻一直在微笑
We're nailing the lid on his coffin, and he's smiling.

我說他的名字也在帳簿上

但他的名字並不在帳簿上

庭上！ 庭上，這公正嗎？
Your Honour! Is that justice?

1073
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,770
他為什麼要調換陪審團？
Please, why did he switch the jury?

1074
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:00,570
你現在要幹嘛？ 繼續跟著組織？
