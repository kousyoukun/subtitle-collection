1
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,100
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

2
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,610
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

3
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,320
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

4
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,870
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

5
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,410
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

6
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,580
Some people say,
reformers here say:

7
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,750
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

8
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,420
What I hope I'm doing, and here's
where your paper's got a point,

9
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,930
is I'm responding to
the will of the people.

10
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,480
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

11
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,480
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

12
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,480
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

13
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,940
I'm a businessman.

14
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,160
Your reputation is that you control
your business through violence.

15
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,000
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

16
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,500
It's all right.

17
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

18
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,930
We used to say, "Y ou can get further
with a kind word and a gun"

19
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,220
"than you can
with just a kind word."

20
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,810
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

21
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,600
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

22
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,770
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me

23
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,280
and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.

24
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,770
<i>Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.</i>

25
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,980
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

26
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,410
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

27
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,330
I'm not buyin' any.

28
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,370
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

29
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,420
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

30
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,680
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

31
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,100
Oh, she does?

32
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,470
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

33
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,070
- There you go.
- Thank you.

34
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,570
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

35
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,200
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...

36
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,950
Hey, Mister! Wait!

37
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,540
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...

38
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,270
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

39
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,860
I know.

40
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,320
Now it's time to go to work.

41
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,630
You'll make a good first impression.

42
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,470
I love you, Eliot.

43
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,180
Now, shoo.

44
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,610
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

45
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,320
- Mr Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

46
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,860
At the request
of the City of Chicago,

47
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,830
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme

48
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,580
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

49
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,580
Mr Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

50
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,630
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working

51
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,880
with the Chicago Police...

52
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,300
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

53
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,680
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr Ness?

54
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,770
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

55
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,190
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

56
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,810
It is the law of the land.

57
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,780
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

58
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,320
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

59
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,910
Do you have any political ambitions?

60
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,830
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

61
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,460
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

62
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,750
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

63
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,630
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

64
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,090
Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

65
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,260
Are you ready to meet the men?

66
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,680
Yes, I am.

67
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,490
I have one more thing to say.

68
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,620
I know that many of you take a drink.

69
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,700
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

70
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,460
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

71
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,260
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

72
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,050
But it's against the law.

73
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,510
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

74
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,890
Are there any questions?

75
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,650
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had

76
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,990
a man undercover here
for some time now.

77
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,240
We've received word
from this informant

78
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,950
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

79
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,870
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

80
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,550
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

81
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,010
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

82
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,810
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

83
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,390
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

84
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,820
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

85
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,660
- How are we doin'
- Okay.

86
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,130
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

87
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,310
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

88
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,100
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

89
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,190
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,910
A message from my wife.

91
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,410
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

92
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,420
Nice to be married, huh?

93
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,400
Just follow me.

94
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,230
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

95
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,780
Get 'em up. Drop it.

96
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,570
Damn it, I can't , it'll break.

97
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,160
Mr Ness. Look, I was just...

98
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,410
Geez, I'm sorry.

99
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,170
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

100
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,580
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

101
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,300
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

102
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay. Just shut up.

103
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,120
All right now...
Let's do some good!

104
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,510
Hold it right there!

105
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,770
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

106
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,700
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

107
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,700
Preseuski.

108
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,910
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

109
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,040
- Mr Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

110
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,800
Let him through here.

111
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,130
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

112
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,640
- You ready?
- Ready.

113
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,790
Liquor, huh?

114
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,250
Get him out of here.

115
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,550
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

116
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,720
That means you, too.

117
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,440
Christ!

118
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,480
Now, what do you think you're doing?

119
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,570
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

120
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,990
Don't you have
more important things to do?

121
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,360
Yeah.

122
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,160
But I'm not doing them right now.

123
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,040
Do we understand each other?

124
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,170
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

125
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,420
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

126
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,550
All right.

127
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,470
Just remember
what we talked about now.

128
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,860
Hey... Wait a minute!

129
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,820
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn citý?

130
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,900
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

131
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,870
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

132
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,200
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

133
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,170
What's your name and unit?

134
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,510
It's right here.

135
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,310
You got a beef?
What is it?

136
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,770
How did you know I had a gun?

137
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,770
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

138
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,490
No.

139
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,780
Are you okay, pal?

140
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,330
I had a rough day on the job.

141
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,040
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

142
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,010
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

143
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,060
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

144
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,390
Here endeth the lesson.

145
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,370
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

146
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,670
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

147
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,840
55 gallons to the barrel.

148
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,440
<i>- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.</i>

149
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:20,220
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good" .

150
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,850
And then, we bust through...

151
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,440
- Mr Ness?
- Yes?

152
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,990
I came here to thank you.

153
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,610
It was...

154
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,620
..my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

155
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,950
I'm sorry. Please.

156
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,120
I'm ...l'm so sorry.

157
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,130
You see, it's ...because I know
that you have children, too.

158
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,470
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

159
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,390
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

160
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,270
And you do that, now.

161
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,580
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

162
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,960
Come in.

163
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,340
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

164
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,510
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

165
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,930
<i>- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.</i>

166
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,730
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

167
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,820
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

168
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,030
If I'm such a good cop...

169
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,320
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

170
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,450
Do you want to tell me?

171
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,540
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

172
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,500
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

173
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,710
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

174
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,670
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

175
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,220
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

176
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,890
I'm askin' you for help.

177
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,850
Well...that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

178
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,860
Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and...twenty pounds ago.

179
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,790
But...I just think it got...
more important to me...

180
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,710
..to stay alive.

181
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,010
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

182
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,980
<i>That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.</i>

183
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,740
<i>I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!</i>

184
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,280
<i>- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

185
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,910
<i>Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.</i>

186
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,040
<i>Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.</i>

187
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,290
<i>Yeah, start it up, Andy.</i>

188
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,340
<i>Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!</i>

189
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,270
<i>Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!</i>

190
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
<i>Andy! She's boilin' over!</i>

191
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,950
- Mr Ness?
- Yes.

192
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,580
Oscar Wallace.

193
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,500
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

194
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,960
- Really?
- Yes.

195
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,880
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?

196
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,800
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...

197
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,970
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

198
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,060
And the one I want to try first...
is this.

199
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,730
He has not filed a return since 1926.

200
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,950
- A return...?
- An income tax return.

201
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,950
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,580
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

203
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,790
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

204
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,090
Would you excuse me?

205
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,840
Please.

206
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,870
Okay. Let's go.

207
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,000
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

208
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,920
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

209
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,640
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

210
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,440
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

211
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,610
And then what are you
prepared to do?

212
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,190
If you open the ball
on these people,

213
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,940
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

214
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,320
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

215
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,620
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

216
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,700
Here's how you get Capone:
he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

217
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,670
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

218
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,500
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

219
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,010
Now, do you want to do that?

220
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,930
Are you ready to do that?

221
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,560
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

222
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,020
I have sworn to put this man away,

223
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:14,400
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

224
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,580
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

225
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,960
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr Ness?

226
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,130
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

227
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,390
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

228
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,230
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

229
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,900
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

230
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:56,610
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

231
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,570
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

232
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Because I swore to uphold the law.

233
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,830
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

234
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,290
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

235
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,590
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

236
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,640
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

237
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,180
Get it off the tree.

238
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,770
Get it off the tree...

239
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,230
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

240
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,610
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

241
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,230
About face!

242
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,200
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr Eliot Ness.

243
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,200
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

244
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:50,040
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...

245
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,500
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

246
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,630
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

247
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,260
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

248
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,050
<i>- Good.
- Williamson!</i>

249
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,770
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

250
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,480
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

251
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,110
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...

252
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,030
To protect and serve...
To protect and...

253
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,410
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

254
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,620
- What I think? I...
- You...

255
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,960
...could help...the force.

256
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,960
- You can help...
- With the force.

257
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,800
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

258
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,890
At ease!

259
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,390
Stone! Out here.

260
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,690
This kid's a prodigy.

261
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,940
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...

262
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,110
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

263
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,370
Where are you from, Stone?

264
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,960
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

265
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,170
George Stone, that's your name?

266
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,010
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

267
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,550
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

268
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,270
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

269
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,390
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

270
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,230
What's that you said?

271
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,230
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

272
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,280
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

273
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,290
Oh, I like him.

274
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,500
Yeah, I like him, too.

275
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,000
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

276
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,510
Yeah, okay.

277
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,970
Eliot Ness.

278
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,100
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and...

279
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,060
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

280
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,400
What do you think?

281
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,860
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

282
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,910
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

283
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,660
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

284
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,670
We need another man.

285
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,090
Mr Ness? This is very interesting.

286
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,380
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu...

287
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,550
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

288
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,800
Carry a gun.

289
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,780
- Jimmy...?
- What?

290
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,660
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?

291
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,700
Shut up. I'm working.

292
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,460
Where? The circus?

293
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,770
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

294
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,070
Liquor raid.

295
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,230
Here?!

296
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,740
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

297
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,910
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

298
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,960
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

299
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,850
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

300
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,020
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

301
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,690
Yes, I do.

302
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,020
Good. Give me that axe.

303
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,700
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

304
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,200
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

305
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,420
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?

306
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,380
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

307
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,380
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

308
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:55,220
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

309
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,890
How do you think he feels now?
Better...or worse?

310
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,070
<i>- What is that?
- What is that?</i>

311
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,450
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

312
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:19,660
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

313
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,330
<i>Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.</i>

314
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,250
And policemen.

315
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,960
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

316
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,340
Lost causes, policemen...

317
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,140
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

318
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,180
- You do?
- Yes.

319
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,600
Why?

320
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:49,440
'T o protect the property
and the citizenry...'

321
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,990
Whoa, it's all right.

322
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,700
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

323
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,700
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

324
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,790
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

325
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,620
Anything you say, Mr Ness.

326
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,880
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

327
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,180
Life goes on.

328
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,400
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

329
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,650
Enthusiasms...

330
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,530
Enthusiasms...

331
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,860
What are mine?

332
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,870
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

333
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,330
- Dames!
- Boozin'

334
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,290
Baseball!

335
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,840
A man...

336
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,390
A man stands alone at the plate.

337
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,020
This is the time for what?

338
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,730
For individual achievement.

339
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,440
There he stands alone.

340
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,820
But in the field, what?

341
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,280
Part of a team.

342
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,750
Teamwork...

343
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:35,170
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

344
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,590
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

345
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,390
If his team don't field...what is he?

346
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,480
You follow me?

347
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,400
No one.

348
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,690
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

349
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,330
I'm goin' out there for myself.

350
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:12,040
But...I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

351
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,540
- Team!
- Team.

352
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,340
Jesus Christ!

353
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,410
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

354
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,000
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

355
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,000
'lf I should die before I wake'

356
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,590
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

357
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,720
- Amen.
- God bless...

358
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,890
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

359
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,100
Amen.

360
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,900
Good night.

361
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,150
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

362
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,200
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

363
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,960
- Where are you going?
- What?

364
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,920
Where are you going?

365
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,970
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

366
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,430
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

367
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,770
And you've still got
some energy left?

368
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,680
Oh, a lot of work.

369
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:59,520
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'

370
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,120
- How are we doin'
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

371
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,750
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn

372
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...

373
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,720
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

374
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,510
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

375
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,350
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs...the list is endless!

376
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,270
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

377
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,480
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show

378
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:46,820
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

379
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,240
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

380
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,000
- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

381
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,290
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

382
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,380
Yes, I know who you are.

383
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,010
Would you excuse us?

384
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,930
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

385
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,350
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

386
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:21,310
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

387
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,740
What's that?

388
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,700
- What is that?
- Mr Ness, you're an educated man.

389
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,370
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

390
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,380
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

391
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,220
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

392
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,430
Would you come in here, please?

393
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,600
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

394
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,020
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag

395
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,860
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

396
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:13,450
You tell your master
that we must agree to...disagree!

397
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,120
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

398
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,920
You fellows are 'untouchable'
is that it? No one can get to you?

399
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,500
You tell Capone...
that I'll see him in hell.

400
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,720
Hey! Nice house!

401
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,760
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

402
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,060
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

403
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,230
Yes.

404
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,690
Nice to have a family.

405
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,110
Yes, it is.

406
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,820
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

407
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,760
Catherine?!

408
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,140
Catherine!

409
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,800
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

410
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,360
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

411
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,620
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

412
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,800
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

413
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,300
Okay, let's go.

414
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:00,310
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

415
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,600
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

416
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:09,190
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

417
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,200
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

418
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,660
Take off your hat.

419
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,200
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

420
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,620
Yes, Mr Ness.

421
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,580
Kiss.

422
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,920
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

423
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,510
Now, go!

424
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,240
Malone!

425
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,790
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

426
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,370
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

427
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,790
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

428
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,960
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

429
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,670
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

430
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,340
A huge international
shipment's coming.

431
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:25,140
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

432
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,440
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

433
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
How do you come by this information?

434
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,860
That's the second rule
of police work:

435
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,820
if you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

436
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,370
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

437
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,160
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

438
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,620
If we can establish
any payments to him,

439
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,880
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

440
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,420
What?

441
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,970
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

442
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,510
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

443
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,770
Well, it's better than nothing.

444
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,980
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

445
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,110
I don't know.

446
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,230
Go to sleep, Oscar.

447
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,160
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey

448
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:12,040
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

449
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,830
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

450
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,920
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

451
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,340
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

452
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,470
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

453
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,810
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

454
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,810
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

455
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,020
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

456
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,900
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr Ness, is half the battle.

457
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,320
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

458
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,870
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

459
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,580
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

460
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,000
Thank you, Captain.

461
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:01,880
All right! Move out!

462
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,030
Take it easy.

463
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,610
Take it easy!
lt'll all happen in time.

464
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,330
This is the job.

465
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,200
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

466
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,040
Just watch what does happen.

467
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,290
Are you my 'tutor'?

468
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,340
Yes, sir, that I am.

469
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,010
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

470
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,310
Then leave it alone.

471
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,560
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

472
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,400
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

473
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,900
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

474
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:09,200
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

475
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,490
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

476
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:17,040
Stitches and standing in the rain...

477
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,450
Listen, Mr Ness...

478
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,950
I had an idea.

479
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,510
You all have your spare shells?

480
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,530
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

481
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,650
And put your man down.

482
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,870
Because he'll do the same to you.

483
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,290
Shoot to kill.

484
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,830
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

485
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,880
Let's go.

486
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,740
Easy...

487
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,570
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

488
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,370
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

489
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,290
George, the count's right.

490
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,790
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

491
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,710
Malone, you and I will
take the men...

492
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,800
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

493
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,510
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

494
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,800
Charge!

495
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,930
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'

496
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:30,190
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

497
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,360
Move, move!

498
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,200
Let's go!

499
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,880
I can't believe it!

500
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:53,130
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

501
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,130
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

502
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,860
Stone, take the first car!

503
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,030
Get this shit out of the way!

504
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,050
Tough guy!

505
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:46,020
Stone!

506
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,600
Go!

507
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,270
Stone!

508
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,690
I'm okay.

509
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,280
You thugs!

510
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,710
You all right?

511
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,800
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

512
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,520
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

513
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,440
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

514
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,650
Hello.

515
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,240
All right! Drop the gun!

516
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,950
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

517
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,080
I said, drop it!

518
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,500
Stop!

519
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,760
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

520
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,130
What are you, deaf?!

521
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,430
What is this, a game?!

522
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,460
Here. Sit down.

523
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:06,930
Stone's gonna be all right.

524
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,100
I got the fellow with the satchel.

525
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,100
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

526
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:22,150
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

527
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,150
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

528
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,950
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

529
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,410
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

530
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,290
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

531
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,170
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

532
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,760
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

533
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,970
Why don't you kiss my ass?

534
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,390
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

535
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,680
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!

536
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,930
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

537
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,190
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

538
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,150
- Eliot!
- What?!

539
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,730
Look at this!

540
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,780
- Look at this!
- What is this?

541
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,820
What is this?

542
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:17,370
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

543
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,830
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'

544
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,840
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'

545
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:30,720
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court' What is this?

546
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,890
Nothin' There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

547
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,430
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

548
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,430
then we can put Capone away.

549
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,360
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

550
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,320
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

551
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,990
Translate this ledger for us!

552
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,740
- In hell.
- In hell?!

553
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,700
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

554
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,540
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

555
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,500
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

556
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,340
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

557
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,470
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

558
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,470
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

559
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,760
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

560
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,730
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

561
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,270
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

562
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,480
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

563
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,860
I'm gonna count to three.

564
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,320
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

565
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,740
One.

566
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,880
Two!

567
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,340
Three.

568
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,880
I'm gonna talk!

569
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:56,680
Don't ! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

570
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:03,560
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

571
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,810
Now, ask him what you want to know.

572
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:11,190
All right... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

573
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,530
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete...

574
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,240
Mister Ness!

575
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,630
I do not approve of your methods!

576
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:32,510
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

577
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,970
- What?
- They got the shipment.

578
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,720
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

579
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,890
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...

580
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:52,030
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

581
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:56,820
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

582
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,240
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

583
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,740
I want to piss on his ashes!

584
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:08,210
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

585
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,670
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

586
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,840
- Yes.
- Like what?

587
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,050
Like what his name is.

588
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:21,430
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

589
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,140
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

590
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:28,230
No...it'll be Edgar.

591
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:33,320
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.

592
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,280
God, you're beautiful.

593
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,370
You should have seen us last night.

594
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:48,580
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

595
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,040
I know. I understand, I do.

596
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:56,460
Just tell me, are you being careful?

597
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,180
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

598
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,550
- Progress?
- Yes?

599
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,930
Mrs Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

600
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:20,070
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone

601
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,200
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading

602
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,960
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

603
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,290
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

604
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,590
Mr Capone could have
up to 28 years.

605
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,970
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

606
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:50,810
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

607
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,150
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.

608
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,270
- We'll call...
- From the corner.

609
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,070
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

610
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,280
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

611
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:05,280
Much more diverting
than accounting.

612
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,660
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

613
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:11,330
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

614
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,760
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

615
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,220
Okay, we see yous tonight.

616
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,180
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

617
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:37,940
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

618
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:43,860
For which I must commend
the excellent work

619
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:47,740
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

620
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,710
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

621
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,880
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

622
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,050
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

623
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:02,630
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

624
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,300
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

625
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,850
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

626
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:16,350
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

627
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,150
Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?

628
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:23,860
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

629
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:28,910
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

630
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,580
They are going to...

631
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:42,960
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

632
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:52,470
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

633
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,810
Oh, no.

634
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,980
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!

635
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,020
Oscar.

636
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,270
Oh, Jesus.

637
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,780
You gonna be all right?

638
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,060
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

639
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,270
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

640
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,110
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

641
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,440
Jimmy!

642
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:10,320
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

643
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:12,570
You know what I mean?

644
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,590
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr Capone...

645
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,300
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr Capone...

646
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,390
I said...

647
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,320
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

648
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,280
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

649
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,490
Now he does.

650
01:08:55,700 --> 01:09:00,040
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

651
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,580
That's it, come on!

652
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:05,380
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

653
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:09,590
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

654
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,670
- What?
- Easy.

655
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,430
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

656
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,390
Easy. It's me. It's me!

657
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,310
Not this way.

658
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,230
You fuck, you got nothin'
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

659
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,110
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'

660
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,700
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin' you punk!

661
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,170
Well, no, I understand.

662
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,260
Believe me, I understand.

663
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,060
Well, what's happened?

664
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,150
He says he can't be unprotected.

665
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,610
What is it that the guy says?

666
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,400
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

667
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:18,950
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

668
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,410
So tomorrow morning the D.A. will
announce that he's dropping the case.

669
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,500
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

670
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,420
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

671
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:34,260
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

672
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,380
Hello?

673
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:41,470
Hello.

674
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,100
Yes.

675
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,310
No, he didn't have a family.

676
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,490
How is everything there?

677
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:03,240
No, you do it however you want.

678
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,540
I promise I will.

679
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,960
You give her my love.

680
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,210
I love you, too.

681
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:20,510
Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

682
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,680
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.

683
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,940
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.

684
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:33,060
I'd like to request to stick around.

685
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:36,820
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

686
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,790
Is that it?

687
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:51,500
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

688
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:54,170
My question is, are we done?

689
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,550
Yes, I think we're done.

690
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,640
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

691
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,220
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr Wallace.

692
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,720
He's dead! And the D.A.
is gonna drop the case!

693
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:09,230
He will not go into court
without a witness

694
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:12,400
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

695
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,440
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

696
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:20,400
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

697
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:38,510
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...

698
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:42,380
- My wife?
- Yeah.

699
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:49,220
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

700
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,900
It's nice being married, eh?

701
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:56,480
Yes.

702
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:59,990
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

703
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:04,490
going over...
kitchen colour charts or something.

704
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:16,840
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

705
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,680
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

706
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,640
Get back to the D.A. and stall him.

707
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:36,520
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

708
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:42,360
I think I know how to find this guy.

709
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:47,200
Walter?

710
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:52,410
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

711
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,540
We're leavin' tonight.

712
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,920
Two ball, down.

713
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,010
Mike, you got a minute?

714
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,890
I do now, don't I?

715
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:15,270
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

716
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:18,810
This is a place for cops.

717
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,610
Can we step outside?

718
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:26,150
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

719
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:35,910
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

720
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,000
What? What?!

721
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,300
I just need one more
piece of information.

722
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,470
One more? Jimmy!

723
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:51,720
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

724
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:58,810
Are you crazy? Y ou're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

725
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:03,020
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

726
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:07,820
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

727
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:10,280
And I tried to save your life.

728
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,750
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'

729
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:19,120
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

730
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:24,340
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

731
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:28,760
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

732
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:34,510
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

733
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:41,980
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

734
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:46,190
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

735
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,530
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

736
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:54,780
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

737
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,540
I'm gonna turn you over!

738
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:01,290
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

739
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,300
You're dead.

740
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,570
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

741
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,610
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'

742
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,250
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

743
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,500
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

744
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,220
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

745
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,010
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...

746
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,850
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

747
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,640
I have men out there
risking more than that.

748
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,350
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead

749
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,520
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

750
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:11,650
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

751
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,450
<i>He's at the D.A. 's.</i>

752
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,570
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

753
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,600
- Al! Al!
- Mr Capone!

754
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,230
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'

755
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:46,560
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

756
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,820
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole'

757
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:54,280
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

758
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:55,910
You understand?

759
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,240
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

760
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,210
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

761
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:10,880
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

762
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,720
To speak to me like men? No.

763
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,840
To harass a peaceful man.

764
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,310
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

765
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,890
I would have
just a little more self respect.

766
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:30,440
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

767
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:33,610
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

768
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,490
Isn't that just like a wop?

769
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:27,410
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

770
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,250
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

771
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,750
Go on, get your ass out of here!

772
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,730
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

773
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:25,570
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

774
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,200
Round the back.

775
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,960
Malone!

776
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,920
Malone.

777
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:14,450
Goddamn! Stone!

778
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,160
Stone!

779
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,790
The phone!

780
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:27,460
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

781
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:33,930
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

782
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,060
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

783
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,850
This? You want this?

784
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,940
You want this?

785
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:55,620
What?

786
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,790
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

787
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,090
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?

788
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:11,510
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

789
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,010
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

790
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,310
He's on this train.

791
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:21,890
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

792
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,360
No. Malone. No.

793
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,320
Stay. Stay.

794
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:32,950
Stay! Malone...

795
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:35,200
No. No, no!

796
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:40,500
Not this... Not this man...

797
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:10,780
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr Ness.

798
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:14,530
We'll be there.

799
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,120
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

800
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:23,080
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

801
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:35,760
Cover the south entrance.

802
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:26,980
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

803
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:35,440
<i>Your attention, please. The Miami
Flier departs at 12.05 from 33.</i>

804
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,700
<i>All aboard.</i>

810
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:28,140
<i>Your attention, please.

812
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:36,190
One more. Here we go.

813
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:00,510
Here we go. You ready?

814
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,510

815
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:10,680

816
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:13,480
<i>This is the final call
for the Miami Flier,</i>

817
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:17,940
<i>leaving at 12.05 on track 33.
All aboard!</i>

818
01:30:57,270 --> 01:31:02,730
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

819
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,360
Are you all right? Thank you.

820
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,030
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

821
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,250
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

822
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,840
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

823
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:26,130
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

824
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:34,310
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

825
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:39,810
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

826
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,860
Thank you, sir.

827
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:56,160
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

828
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:59,460
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

829
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:07,090
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

830
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,890
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

831
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:16,310
Is something wrong?

832
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,890
Sir?

833
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,390
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

834
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:21,730
- What are you doin'
- Shut up!

835
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:27,770
- What are you doin'
- Shut the fuck up!

836
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:31,320
- Hold it!
- Please...

837
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:34,150
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

838
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,660
I said hold it!

839
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,660
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

840
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:45,790
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

841
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,670
See? Or else he dies.

842
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,920
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'

843
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,560
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

844
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:06,310
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'

845
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:10,940
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

846
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,650
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

847
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,740
- One!
- Will you stop it!

848
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:29,290
Take him.

849
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,420
Two.

850
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:02,280
The two coded entries
in this ledger

851
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:07,120
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

852
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:13,000
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

853
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,800
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

854
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,680
I said that is correct.

855
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:26,730
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

856
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:31,020
I will.

857
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:33,570
Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you.

858
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:36,570
I said, I will.

859
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:41,490
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr Capone?

860
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,030
Yes, I was.

861
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,290
And you personally
distributed monies...

862
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:50,540
..vast, undeclared monies...

863
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:54,090
..to Mr Capone?

864
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,670
Yes, I did.

865
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,720
Would you tell us the amounts?

866
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:07,270
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr Capone

867
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,400
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

868
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:18,070
Would you repeat that amount, please?

869
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:24,910
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

870
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:43,550
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

871
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,930
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

872
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,290
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

873
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,920
Get me the bailiff.

874
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:22,920
It'll be a fast trial.

875
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:31,140
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

876
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:36,270
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

877
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:46,200
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

878
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:19,360
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

879
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:24,150
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

880
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,990
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

881
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:35,910
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

882
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,750
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

883
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,210
"T o Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

884
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:47,300
"Mr Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

885
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:49,930
"W illiam Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

886
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:53,600
I'm sorry, Mr Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

887
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:57,770
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

888
01:39:57,980 --> 01:40:01,150
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

889
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:36,600
1634 Racine... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

890
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:53,370
Don't . Let him go.

891
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,210
- No!
- Here, take it.

892
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:15,880
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

893
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:19,590
What are you waitin' for?

894
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:23,680
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

895
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,140
Don't push me.

896
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:35,520
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

897
01:45:35,730 --> 01:45:38,860
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

898
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:41,240
'Cause you killed my friend!

899
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:45,080
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

900
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:48,910
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

901
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,620
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

902
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,810
Did he sound anything like that?

903
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:42,130
One picture, come on, one picture.

904
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:47,430
Mr Ness, take a look at this.

905
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:50,770
Mr Ness?

906
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:56,860
Mr Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

907
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,820
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr Ness.

908
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:02,820
They've been bribed.

909
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:07,120
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

910
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:10,790
He's in the car.

911
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:33,680
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...

912
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:39,610
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

913
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:44,690
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

914
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:48,990
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

915
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,830
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...

916
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,460
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr Ness.

917
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:10,050
Would you excuse us?

918
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,080
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

919
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:21,540
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

920
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:24,880
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

921
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:30,340
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

922
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:35,810
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

923
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:38,430
What's he talking about?

924
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:44,770
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

925
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:47,320
Your Honour, I object!

926
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:49,490
Overruled.

927
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:55,280
What did you tell him?

928
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:00,330
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

929
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:04,460
His name wasn't in the ledger!

930
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:07,710
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

931
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,420
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

932
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:12,970
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.

933
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:15,760
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'

934
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,350
Order!

935
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:23,690
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

936
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,860
and enter a plea of Guilty.

937
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:32,240
- Guiltý?
- Order in the court!

938
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:34,490
Order!

939
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:46,290
Bailiff! Bailiff!

940
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,960
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

941
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:51,800
Eliot!

942
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:55,180
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

943
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:58,100
Please, why did he switch the jury?

944
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,850
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

945
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,520
Excuse me.

946
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:07,110
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

947
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:14,200
Is this justice?

948
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:20,240
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

949
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:21,950
What did you say?

950
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:25,290
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

951
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,540
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

952
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:30,300
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

953
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,300
Here endeth the lesson.

954
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:37,760
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

955
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:41,180
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

956
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,470
So much violence.

957
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:10,080
Cleaning up a little.

958
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:21,760
I guess this is goodbye.

959
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:24,680
Goodbye, George.

960
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:30,390
I want to...thank you for this.

961
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,270
No. Thank you.

962
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:53,790
Mr Ness... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

963
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,090
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

964
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:03,300
I'm going home.

965
01:55:14,230 --> 01:55:16,860
Mr Ness!
Any comment for the record?

966
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:19,770
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

967
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:22,530
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

968
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:25,740
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

969
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:29,030
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
