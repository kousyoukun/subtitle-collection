<i>铁面无私</i>

6
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,741
1930年,禁酒令使芝加哥变成战场

7
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,444
帮派人物争地盘抢权力

8
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,523
建立亿万元计的私酒王国

9
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:03,593
他们用暴力手段来巩固他们的势力

10
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:06,821
这是一个无法纪的时代

11
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:11,398
枭雄 艾尔.卡彭 不可一世

12
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:26,345
艾尔,报纸上有篇文章
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

13
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:29,251
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

14
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,884
事实上你等于是芝加哥市长

15
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,964
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

16
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,488
你只是差一纸委任令而己

17
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,590
我告诉你,这很动人
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

18
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,365
有许多事可笑,因为那是真的

19
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:46,059
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

20
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,667
有些人说:拿那人下狱
Some people say,
reformers here say:

21
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,399
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

22
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:52,867
他自以为他在干什么

23
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:56,309
同样的,我在干什么
What I hope I'm doing, and here's
where your paper's got a point,

24
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:59,211
你们报纸要弄清楚,
我是在反映民众意见
is I'm responding to
the will of the people.

25
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:04,683
人们要喝酒,你知道我知道,大家都知道
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

26
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,380
我只是知而后行

27
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:09,321
说什么贩卖私酒?什么叫贩卖私酒?
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

28
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:14,932
我不是在卖私酒,我只是个生意人
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

29
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,589
I'm a businessman.

30
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:21,064
你以暴力控制生意,怎么说
Your reputation is that you control
your business through violence.

31
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,969
把你的货强迫推销出去
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

32
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,041
没关系
It's all right.

33
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:36,753
我在恶劣环境下长大
I grew up in a tough neighborhood.

34
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:42,389
我们常说:枪杆胜过许多好话
We used to say, "You can get further
with a kind word and a gun"

35
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,866
"than you can
with just a kind word."

36
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,893
在我那种环境这是真的
And in that neighborhood
it might've been true.

37
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,498
然后你会赢得名誊
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

38
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,038
芝加哥的确有暴力存在
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me

39
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,730
但并不在于我或是我雇用的人
and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.

40
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,274
我告诉你们原因?因为那不是好生意

41
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,418
<i>Leave us alone down here,</i>
<i>we've got everything we need.</i>

42
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,138
走开,不要打搅我们

43
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:34,972
我们不需要任何东西

44
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,629
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

45
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,172
你那些东西毫无用处

46
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,050
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

47
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:41,284
很有用的,很值得一买

48
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:45,078
我什么也不买
I'm not buyin' any.

49
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:52,294
别担心,我们不会回来了
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

50
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,535
你家里的人都好吗
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

51
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:58,725
他们很好

52
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,321
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

53
00:05:58,937 --> 00:05:59,926
你妈好呢

54
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,166
她有点感冒

55
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:07,668
是吗?我很难过听到这事
Oh, she does?

56
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,119
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

57
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:09,512
她不要紧的

58
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,783
- 给你
- 谢谢
- There you go.
- Thank you.

59
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:18,717
不客气,小可爱
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

60
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,658
过马路时要当心,告诉你妈

61
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,886
先生…先生
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...

62
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:28,061
先生,等一下
Hey, Mister! Wait!

63
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,183
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...

64
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,191
先生,等一下

65
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:32,233
你忘了你的手提箱

66
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,094
“私酒战争屠杀十岁女孩”

67
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,803
是的,我听到收音机广播了
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

68
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,701
我了解
I know.

69
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:45,838
上班时间到了
Now it's time to go to work.

70
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,270
You'll make a good first impression.

71
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,819
你要给人第一眼好印象

72
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,599
我爱你,艾略特
I love you, Eliot.

73
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,829
Now, shoo.

74
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,168
走吧

75
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,812
艾略特.奈斯,财政部特派员
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

76
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,607
奈斯
- Mr. Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

77
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,976
谢谢你,局长

78
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,518
基于芝加哥市民要求
At the request
of the City of Chicago,

79
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,020
联邦政府令财政部成立专案

80
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,472
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme

81
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:37,422
制止私酒之贩卖及其所引发之暴力
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

82
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:38,653
奈斯先生
Mr. Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

83
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:40,330
这个计划包括什么

84
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,325
我和其它财政部专员
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working

85
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:46,936
将与警方及其它单位合作

86
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,527
with the Chicago Police...

87
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:48,901
这是否又是一次官样文章
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

88
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,234
你对禁酒令有何看法
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

89
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,410
你喝不喝酒?奈斯先生

90
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,412
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

91
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,807
奈斯先生,回答问题

92
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,675
这不是官样文章

93
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:00,883
我来告诉你们,我对禁酒令的看法
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

94
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,513
那是国家的法律
It is the law of the land.

95
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:05,315
你自认你是位扫荡战士吗?奈斯先生
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

96
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:08,014
你有何专长担此大任
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

97
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,820
你可有政治野心
Do you have any political ambitions?

98
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,054
好了,今天到此为止
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

99
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,101
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

100
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,093
你有何计划?打算如何着手

101
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,065
你去看报纸吧
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

102
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,297
让我和你同去,我们会配合得很好
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

103
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:24,873
不,爱莫能助

104
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:28,736
奈斯先生,奥德森中尉,飞骑警队
Mr. Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

105
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,275
你准备会见弟兄了吗
Are you ready to meet the men?

106
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:34,546
是的,我准备好了

107
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,325
Yes, I am.

108
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:41,782
“预备室武器登记”

109
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,296
我还有一件事要说
I have one more thing to say.

110
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:54,396
我知道你们很多人喝酒
I know that many of you take a drink.

111
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,502
今天以前的事我不管
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

112
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:02,838
但今后要干净,停止喝酒
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

113
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:09,277
问题不在于喝酒是否伤身
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

114
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,182
而在于那是违反法律,各位
But it's against the law.

115
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,790
我们要厉行法律便要以身作则
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

116
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,990
有疑问吗?
Are there any questions?

117
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:25,530
很好
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had

118
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:30,165
财政部有位密探卧底一段时间了

119
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,630
a man undercover here
for some time now.

120
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,882
We've received word
from this informant

121
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:35,711
我们接获情报,
昨天自加拿大运来了大批私酒

122
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,594
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

123
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:39,748
所以我希望你们准备一下
我们要去抓他们了
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

124
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:50,358
记住,私酒箱上有红色记号
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

125
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:51,722
是的,长官,我知道

126
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,655
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

127
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,196
密探穿的是灰大衣白围巾,不要抓他

128
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:59,451
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

129
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,198
灰大衣,白围巾

130
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:01,731
就这样,你的人准备好了吗
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

131
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,771
是的,先生,都准备好了

132
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:04,907
很好

133
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:14,241
- 稍息
- 准备对付坏蛋
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

134
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,649
准备如何?好了
- How are we doin'?
- Okay.

135
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,332
来点三明治
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

136
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:31,661
不,谢谢,长官

137
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:40,376
你紧张吗
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

138
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:41,602
不,长官

139
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:45,713
你在这单位很久了
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

140
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,417
才一阵子

141
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,345
我想大家都想把事做好
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,682
是的,长官

143
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:57,350
我非常以你为荣

144
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:01,028
我太太写的字条
A message from my wife.

145
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:05,062
- 你结婚了?
- 是的
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

146
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,165
结婚不错,是吧
Nice to be married, huh?

147
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:27,856
跟我来
Just follow me.

148
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,800
联邦官员,手举起来
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

149
00:13:13,004 --> 00:13:14,164
联邦官员,手举起来
Get 'em up. Drop it.

150
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,365
东西放下
Damn it, I can't, it'll break.

151
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:18,472
我不能,会砸坏

152
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,802
Mr. Ness. Look, I was just...

153
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,806
对不起

154
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,054
Geez, I'm sorry.

155
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:30,080
听着,我可以为你做许多事情
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

156
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:34,554
我抢大新闻,替你宣扬
争取新闻界支持如何?
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

157
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,942
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

158
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,989
让我帮你,如何?

159
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,425
闭嘴
Okay. Just shut up.

160
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:09,451
好了,各位,我们大干一场吧
All right now...
Let's do some good!

161
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,571
站住别动
Hold it right there!

162
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:31,741
联邦官员,你们因违反禁酒令被捕了
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

163
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,342
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

164
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,622
普勒斯基
Preseuski.

165
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,066
借过,借过
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

166
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:51,257
我有许可

167
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:52,959
奈斯先生
- Mr. Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

168
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:55,264
不要紧,让他进来

169
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,398
让他进来
Let him through here.

170
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,172
你要拍照就现在拍吧
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

171
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:05,873
你要拍照就现在拍吧
- You ready?
- Ready.

172
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,434
Liquor, huh?

173
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:38,474
带他出去
Get him out of here.

174
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,478
把这儿拆散,现在
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

175
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,176
- 带他出去
- 是的,长官

176
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:46,649
好了,走吧

177
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,649
你也出去
That means you, too.

178
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,082
Christ!

179
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,597
“缉酒战士奈斯灰头土脸”

180
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:36,863
“差劲的艾略特.奈斯”

181
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,231
“我非常以你为荣”

182
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:17,644
你在干什么?
Now, what do you think you're doing?

183
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,450
要丢垃圾丢到垃圾袋中
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

184
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,084
你没有更重要的事做吗?
Don't you have
more important things to do?

185
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:32,661
有,但我不必现在去做
Yeah.

186
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,803
But I'm not doing them right now.

187
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:35,665
我们彼此都明白
Do we understand each other?

188
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,771
好了,朋友,别乱动
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

189
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:47,769
- 你为何带着枪
- 我是财政部特派员
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

190
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:55,783
好吧,我没空和你闲扯
All right.

191
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,119
Just remember
what we talked about now.

192
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,500
Hey... Wait a minute!

193
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:06,452
等一下,这个城市的警察是怎么回事?

194
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,462
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn city?

195
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:07,858
他们是怎么教你的

196
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,549
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

197
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,323
你竟背对着位带枪的人

198
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,000
你是位财政部官员
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

199
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,637
何以见得,那只是我说的而己

200
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:18,271
谁愿冒充财政部官员,除了疯子外
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

201
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,446
你的姓名和单位
What's your name and unit?

202
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:32,478
在这上面
It's right here.

203
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:36,357
你有牢骚
You got a beef?
What is it?

204
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,053
怎么回事?

205
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:42,631
你怎么知道我有带枪
How did you know I had a gun?

206
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:45,893
你要什么?学会警察的绝招吗
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

207
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:51,469
不
No.

208
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,537
你没事吧?朋友
Are you okay, pal?

209
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,974
I had a rough day on the job.

210
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:00,273
我工作不顺利

211
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,250
你要回家了吗
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

212
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,284
我正要回去

213
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:12,823
你已做到了执法者规则第一条
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

214
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:20,228
确保能活着下班回家
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

215
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:23,537
第一课结束
Here endeth the lesson.

216
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:27,094
总数十万元,一共四十桶,别有空的
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

217
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:30,102
我给你的底帐都在帐簿里
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

218
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,034
桶是五十五加仑
55 gallons to the barrel.

219
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:48,680
我是艾迪
- It's Eddie.
<i>- Come in, Eddie.</i>

220
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,019
进来,艾迪

221
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:08,134
“缉酒战士奈斯灰头土脸”

222
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:18,986
他坐进除雪车里说道
“我们好好干一场”
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good".

223
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,255
然后我们破门而入
And then, we bust through...

224
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:52,519
“缉酒战士奈斯灰头土脸”

225
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:14,605
- 奈斯先生?
- 什么事
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes?

226
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,376
我是来谢谢你的
I came here to thank you.

227
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:23,519
被炸死的小女孩是我的女儿
It was...

228
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:24,261
...my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

229
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,817
我很难过,请进
I'm sorry. Please.

230
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,768
I'm... I'm so sorry.

231
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,487
我很难过

232
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:37,529
你了解,因为我知道你也有小孩
You see, it's... because I know
that you have children, too.

233
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:43,603
你会真心认为这是件悲伤的事
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

234
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:47,176
你要阻止他们
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

235
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,913
And you do that, now.

236
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,910
你要阻止他们

237
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:49,296
你要干什么
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

238
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,238
我想和你谈谈

239
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,039
请进
Come in.

240
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:02,379
我要找一批人,首先找上的是你
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

241
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:03,484
奈斯,奈斯
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

242
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:07,020
我只是个可怜的巡夜警察

243
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:12,578
- Now, how can <i>I</i> help <i>you?</i>
- Just work with me.

244
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,417
我如何能帮助你

245
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:12,925
只要和我一起办事

246
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:14,892
我为什么要
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

247
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:16,757
因为你是好警察

248
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,600
你怎么知道
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

249
00:24:19,937 --> 00:24:20,926
你告诉我的

250
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,672
If I'm such a good cop...

251
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,070
我若是好警察

252
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:28,042
我还会在这年纪仍担任巡夜吗?
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

253
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,095
Do you want to tell me?

254
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,007
你想告诉我吗

255
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:33,649
也许我是心地善良
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

256
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,115
罪恶圈里唯一的好警察
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

257
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:37,581
你想听这些吗

258
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:39,619
我没要求你
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

259
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:42,485
我不在乎,你要去巡夜就请便
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

260
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,326
你愿跟我一起吗?我需要帮助
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

261
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,895
我在请你帮忙
I'm askin' you for help.

262
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:59,499
Well... that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

263
00:24:57,574 --> 00:24:59,701
你害怕什么

264
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,606
奈斯先生,希望在十年前就遇到你
Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and... twenty pounds ago.

265
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,307
或是体重轻二十磅前

266
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:16,017
现在对我较重要的便是保住老命
But... I just think it got...
more important to me...

267
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,350
...to stay alive.

268
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:26,628
所以我甘心担任巡夜
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

269
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:28,902
谢谢,我不干

270
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:45,949
来,开车吧,我们去兜风
<i>That's good, Andy. Let's start up</i>
<i>the thing and take a little ride.</i>

271
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:48,522
我要听一下熊猫牌引擎的声音
<i>I wanna hear</i>
<i>that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!</i>

272
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:52,127
- 好,让我开车门
- 好的
<i>- Yeah, let me open the door here.</i>
<i>- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

273
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:55,821
你快去把门捡起来
<i>Whoopsy daisy,</i>
<i>pick up the door there, Andy.</i>

274
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:59,969
把它扔到后座,让我发动引擎
<i>Throw it in the back seat.</i>
<i>Now, let me get the thing started.</i>

275
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,400
对,发动引擎吧
<i>Yeah, start it up, Andy.</i>

276
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:12,113
天啊!听听引擎声
<i>Holy mackerel, Andy!</i>
<i>Listen to that Bearcat motor!</i>

277
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:16,719
听起来就像大熊不停追着小猫
<i>Yeah, it sounds like the bear</i>
<i>is chasin' that cat all round it!</i>

278
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:20,756
引擎过热冒烟了
<i>Andy! She's boilin' over!</i>

279
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:33,125
奈斯先生?
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes.

280
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,559
奈斯先生?

281
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:36,569
奥斯卡.华莱士
Oscar Wallace.

282
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,172
华盛顿派我来的
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

283
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:44,103
很好
- Really?
- Yes.

284
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:48,741
我很高兴你加入…对不起
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr. Wallace. Would you excuse me?

285
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,447
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...

286
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,782
我们现在一筹莫展,你有建议吗?

287
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:55,720
是的,我有
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

288
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:59,562
我首先要试的便是这个
And the one I want to try first...
is this.

289
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:07,262
他自1926年就没有申报过
He has not filed a return since 1926.

290
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:10,670
申报
- A return?
- An income tax return.

291
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,276
申报所得税

292
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,106
- 申报所得税?
- 是的,先生
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:20,224
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

294
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:18,178
你在局里是做什么的,华莱士

295
00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:20,179
我是会计

296
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:22,717
我是会计
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

297
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,717
是的,总局派我来此

298
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,584
失陪一下
Would you excuse me?

299
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:33,522
坐吧
Please.

300
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,516
Okay. Let's go.

301
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:02,386
好了,我们走

302
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:06,645
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

303
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,420
去哪里

304
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:06,453
这里隔墙有耳

305
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,395
你说你想知道,如何扳倒卡彭
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

306
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,739
你真的要捉他
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

307
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:22,401
你明白我的意思,你打算怎么做?

308
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:25,080
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

309
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:25,510
一切合法的行动

310
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:27,946
若不成,你又有何打算?
And then what are you
prepared to do?

311
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,836
If you open the ball
on these people,

312
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:33,946
如果你打算向他们开战,
你就要一直战斗下去

313
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,589
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

314
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:37,387
因为他们非和你拼个你死我活不可
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

315
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:39,789
我要捉卡彭,我不知该如何下手
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

316
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:44,349
Here's how you get Capone:
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

317
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:42,392
要捉卡彭,就要比他强

318
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,533
他拔刀,你就拔枪

319
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:47,431
他伤了你的部下,你就宰了他的爪牙
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

320
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,333
那就是芝加哥的规则
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

321
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,166
那就是捉卡彭的方法

322
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:56,937
你能那样干吗
Now, do you want to do that?

323
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,573
Are you ready to do that?

324
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,405
你准备好那样干了吗

325
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:05,588
我提供你这建议,你要不要接受?
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

326
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,955
我已发誓要将他绳之以法
I have sworn to put this man away,

327
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,595
以合法手段,尽我所能去达成
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

328
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:25,224
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

329
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:25,404
天主憎恶懦夫

330
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:34,909
你可知血誓之意义
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr. Ness?

331
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:36,917
是的
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

332
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,088
很好,你刚得了个宣过血誓的人

333
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:44,624
你明白那晚的突袭何以不成功?
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

334
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,871
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

335
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,056
有人通风报信

336
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:48,322
对,你开窍了

337
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:51,296
芝加哥就像娼馆一样污秽
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

338
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:53,828
首先的是,你能相信谁
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

339
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,231
没有人

340
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,428
警察?没有任何人

341
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,505
这里没有人喜欢你
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

342
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,370
那你为何肯帮我

343
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:04,279
因为我曾宣誓维护法律执行
Because I swore to uphold the law.

344
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:07,073
你要相信的话,我再告诉你另一件事
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

345
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,985
你能信任谁?
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

346
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,152
- 我谁也不信任
- 那是件悲哀的事

347
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:16,233
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

348
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:15,655
我们谁也不能信任的话要如何取得帮助

349
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,060
如果你不想拿到烂苹果,
那就别拿桶子里的
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

350
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,198
去摘树上的
Get it off the tree.

351
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,394
去树上摘
Get it off the tree...

352
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:31,874
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

353
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:32,231
手放在扳机罩,弹出弹夹

354
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:34,740
放下左轮,退后一步
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

355
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,203
向后转
About face!

356
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:40,311
赖特,见过艾略特.奈斯
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr. Eliot Ness.

357
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:43,018
财政部特派员,你好
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

358
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:49,723
我们需要人手,
我们有财政部的公文要求协助

359
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:49,683
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...

360
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:53,259
这班上谁的射击成绩最好
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

361
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:54,521
威廉森和斯通
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

362
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,824
好,替我叫他们来好吗

363
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,626
一次一位

364
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:01,529
- 请问他们是否结婚了?
- 没有
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

365
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,697
- Good.
<i>- Williamson!</i>

366
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:04,371
威廉森
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

367
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:05,666
你可是结过婚了

368
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:07,966
我不要结过婚的人

369
00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:12,411
好了,稍息,小伙子
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

370
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:13,640
我有些话问你

371
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:17,753
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...

372
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:15,813
你为何投考警校

373
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,680
为了保护

374
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,856
为了保护…服务
To protect and serve...
To protect and...

375
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:25,424
别背书上的答案,告诉我你的想法

376
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:25,052
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

377
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,263
- What I think? I...
- You...

378
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:27,091
我的想法

379
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:31,666
我…可以帮助…警方

380
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,600
...could help... the force.

381
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,629
你可以帮助
- You can help...
- With the force.

382
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,605
好了,谢谢
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

383
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:40,834
未来的局长人选

384
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,717
稍息
At ease!

385
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:52,037
Stone! Out here.

386
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,913
斯通,出来

387
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,333
This kid's a prodigy.

388
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,385
这小子是天才

389
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,228
你为何加入警察行列
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...

390
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,163
为了保护人民财产

391
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,759
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

392
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,596
请别说废话,浪费我的时间

393
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:08,999
你是哪里人?斯通
Where are you from, Stone?

394
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:12,873
南方人
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

395
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:17,875
斯通,乔治.斯通是你本名吗?

396
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,813
George Stone, that's your name?

397
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,315
你的真名是什么
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

398
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:24,014
那就是我的真名

399
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,883
不是,在你改名换姓前叫什么?
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

400
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:31,553
乔瑟比班达
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

401
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:35,730
我就知道,我早就说过队上有坏分子

402
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,039
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

403
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:38,793
你说什么
What's that you said?

404
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:44,338
我说你撒谎,是个败类
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

405
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:49,441
比你好多了,你这爱尔兰臭猪
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

406
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:52,341
我喜欢他
Oh, I like him.

407
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:57,917
我也喜欢他
Yeah, I like him, too.

408
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,648
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

409
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:01,982
你刚加入了财政部,小伙子

410
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,620
好吧
Yeah, okay.

411
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,192
艾略特.奈斯
Eliot Ness.

412
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,743
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and...

413
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:13,163
我们从西区和北区接获报告

414
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,565
谢谢,警官,谢谢
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

415
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:24,571
你觉得如何
What do you think?

416
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:28,143
像杂耍团的小丑一样
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

417
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,347
我也是这样想
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

418
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,287
现在,你们准备好去办事了吗?

419
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:35,123
去哪里
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

420
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:39,159
去突检私酒,我们还少个人

421
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,311
We need another man.

422
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:42,158
奈斯先生,这很有趣
Mr. Ness? This is very interesting.

423
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:45,458
我发现财政部的纪录上
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu...

424
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:47,562
你有警证吗?
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

425
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:48,903
有的
Carry a gun.

426
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:50,265
拿支枪吧

427
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:08,246
吉米
- Jimmy?
- What?

428
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:09,916
什么?

429
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:14,520
你穿那样是干什么?万圣节吗
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?

430
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:16,289
闭嘴,我在上班
Shut up. I'm working.

431
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,563
哪儿?马戏团吗
Where? The circus?

432
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,416
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

433
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,422
就是这里

434
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,683
我们来这里干什么

435
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:43,916
突检私酒
Liquor raid.

436
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:47,986
这里?
Here?!

437
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:50,928
奈斯先生,大家都知道私酒在何处
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

438
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:55,537
问题不在于找出私酒
而在于谁敢招惹卡彭

439
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:57,556
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

440
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,064
我们进去

441
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:06,639
你最好确定是这里
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

442
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:17,150
一进入此门你就是走进麻烦之中
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

443
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:19,726
不能回头,你明白吗
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

444
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,426
是的,我明白
Yes, I do.

445
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,667
Good. Give me that axe.

446
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,664
好,把斧头给我

447
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:38,505
联邦官员,手举起来,不准动
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

448
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,848
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

449
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:39,807
突击检查

450
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:43,060
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?

451
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:44,019
你们是在干什么

452
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:47,022
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

453
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,348
所有的物品都充公你们全被捕了

454
00:35:47,657 --> 00:35:52,959
这样不对,你们可有拘捕令
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

455
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:54,863
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

456
00:35:53,163 --> 00:35:54,824
这就是拘票

457
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,535
How do you think he feels now?
Better... or worse?

458
00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:00,898
你们现在认为他感觉好些还是不好?

459
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:11,372
那是什么?那是什么?
- What is that?
- What is <i>that?</i>

460
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:14,091
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

461
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:16,918
你不信教吗,那是我的钥匙链

462
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:19,304
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

463
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:18,948
那个是圣犹大

464
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:23,976
<i>Il Santo Jude.</i>
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

465
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:23,959
犹大是失败者的守护神

466
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:25,756
他也守护警察
And policemen.

467
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:28,864
警察的守护神
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

468
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,425
每个人都需要朋友的

469
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,663
失败和警察
Lost causes, policemen...

470
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,963
你想当哪一种
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

471
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:39,840
我想当警察

472
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:41,874
- 是吗?
- 是的
- You do?
- Yes.

473
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:44,205
为什么?
Why?

474
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:49,050
为了保护市民生命财产
'To protect the property
and the citizenry... '

475
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,630
Whoa, it's all right.

476
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:54,123
没事的,没事的

477
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,190
你干嘛?
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

478
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:58,649
我只是来恭贺你们,
我可以替你们拍张照吗

479
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,345
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

480
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:03,432
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

481
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:03,862
好,但不能发表,只能给我们

482
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:05,364
听你的,奈斯先生
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

483
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:10,522
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

484
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:10,439
看这里,好了,预备

485
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:20,115
日子要过下去
Life goes on.

486
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:28,290
人们期望卓越的人有热忱
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

487
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:34,725
热忱,热忱
Enthusiasms...

488
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,172
Enthusiasms...

489
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,803
我呢?我热衷什么
What are mine?

490
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,514
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

491
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:43,996
什么能使我高兴?

492
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:46,937
美女…喝酒
- Dames!
- Boozin'!

493
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:51,775
棒球
Baseball!

494
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:03,356
一个人,一个人上场打球时
A man...

495
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:04,034
A man stands alone at the plate.

496
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:08,497
那是什么时刻
This is the time for what?

497
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:12,565
一个人的成就时刻
For individual achievement.

498
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:19,900
他单独站在那,在场上有些什么?
There he stands alone.

499
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,466
But in the field, what?

500
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:23,505
球队的一部分
Part of a team.

501
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,390
Teamwork...

502
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,944
团队合作

503
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:35,255
投球,接球,打暗号构成一个球队
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

504
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:40,658
打拼出自己的人生
卢斯、库伯（棒球选手）都是如此
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

505
00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:47,901
如果球队没胜出,那算什么
If his team don't field... what is he?

506
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,123
You follow me?

507
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,467
你们懂我意思吗

508
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:57,613
什么都不算
现在天气晴朗,看台上全是人
No one.

509
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:59,339
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

510
00:38:57,814 --> 00:38:59,406
他有什么话说

511
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,950
我上场是为了我自己
I'm goin' out there for myself.

512
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:12,223
但是除非球队赢球我才有功劳
But... I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

513
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,188
- Team!
- Team.

514
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,988
Jesus Christ!

515
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,056
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

516
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:49,497
在我睡觉的时候

517
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:52,668
我祈天主佑我灵
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

518
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,899
当我清醒的时候
'lf I should die before I wake'

519
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:59,199
我祈天主护我灵
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

520
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:01,306
阿门
- Amen.
- God bless...

521
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:03,876
上帝保佑妈妈,保佑爸爸
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

522
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,672
保佑洋娃娃,阿门

523
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,042
阿门
Amen.

524
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,544
Good night.

525
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:20,829
- 晚安,爸爸
- 晚安,小姑娘
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

526
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,056
要擦鼻子吗
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

527
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,371
你上哪去?
- Where are you going?
- What?

528
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,567
Where are you going?

529
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,878
你要到哪去?

530
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:44,949
我要下楼去准备明天的工作
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

531
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:47,145
你忙了一天了,是吗
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

532
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,388
是的,没错

533
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,389
你还有剩余精力吗
And you've still got
some energy left?

534
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:53,352
工作真多
Oh, a lot of work.

535
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:59,393
你何不上来替我梳梳头
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.

536
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:09,237
“缉酒战士终于得胜”

537
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,281
进展如何
- How are we doin'?
- Capone's organization is diverse.

538
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:17,385
卡彭的组织真是复杂

539
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:21,398
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn

540
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:20,317
你看,他们有加拿大控股公司

541
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:25,358
旗下又有洗衣店、车厂、玩具公司…

542
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:25,527
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...

543
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,721
玩具公司?
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

544
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:30,160
是的,记得提醒我买玩具

545
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:31,158
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

546
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:34,860
巴拿马船运公司,说也说不完

547
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:34,995
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs... the list is endless!

548
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:39,066
全都在他人名下
没有一家是登记于卡彭名下的
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

549
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:42,540
我们无法因他未报税而告他
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show

550
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:46,078
除非我们能证明
这些公司的钱都流向他那里
that any of the 'organization'
business money is going to him.

551
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:48,840
在法律上,他没得利益
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

552
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:50,709
他没有任何收入?

553
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,115
奈斯先生,有访客
- Mr. Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

554
00:41:53,322 --> 00:41:55,313
- 奈斯先生
- 我是奈斯

555
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,935
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

556
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:56,549
我能和你谈谈吗?

557
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,454
地检处的奥立佛

558
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,020
Yes, I know who you are.

559
00:41:58,661 --> 00:42:00,492
我知道你是谁

560
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:04,560
请你们出去一下
Would you excuse us?

561
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:12,201
我们的工作正忙,请问有何贵干?
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

562
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:14,993
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

563
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:15,639
我是来恭贺你们完成了件大功

564
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:21,109
来分享你们的一些好运
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

565
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:26,212
那是什么?
What's that?

566
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:32,660
那是什么?
- What is that?
- Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

567
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,762
奈斯先生你是个受过教育的人

568
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:37,432
我非常敬佩你
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

569
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:42,098
有一件很大很热门的生意
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

570
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:44,637
受到了你们的干扰

571
00:42:45,508 --> 00:42:49,239
你何不睁只眼闭只眼听其自然
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

572
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:51,878
你们进来
Would you come in here, please?

573
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:02,848
在罗马时代,如果有人被判行贿官员
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

574
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,668
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag

575
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:05,994
他会被割掉鼻子
和一只野兽装入同一袋中

576
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:08,505
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

577
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:07,787
再被丢入河中

578
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:13,093
You tell your master
that we must agree to... disagree!

579
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:13,599
你去告诉你的主子
我们一致同意反对你们

580
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:15,826
你犯了大错
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

581
00:43:16,038 --> 00:43:18,472
我已经犯错了,我正开始乐在其中

582
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:22,561
You fellows are 'untouchable',
is that it? No one can get to you?

583
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:21,074
你们铁面无私,是不是

584
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:23,142
没人能动你们?

585
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:26,148
You tell Capone...
that I'll see him in hell.

586
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:24,506
去告诉卡彭

587
00:43:24,714 --> 00:43:26,477
- 每个人都可动摇的
- 我会送他下地狱

588
00:43:29,852 --> 00:43:31,547
嘿,好房子
Hey! Nice house!

589
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:33,585
我说,好一座房子
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

590
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:34,882
你住在那里吗

591
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,650
小女孩要过生日是吗?
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

592
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:41,252
是的
Yes.

593
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,162
有个家真好
Nice to have a family.

594
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:48,561
没错
Yes, it is.

595
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:54,604
你要好好照顾,免得出了什么事
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

596
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:10,681
凯瑟林
Catherine?!

597
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,780
Catherine!

598
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:16,023
凯瑟林,孩子呢

599
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:17,449
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

600
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:17,859
她在楼上,艾略特

601
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:31,770
你在干什么
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

602
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:34,275
我在熨衣服

603
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:39,443
是吗,跟爸爸来好吗
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

604
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,389
艾略特
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

605
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:55,234
我们走

606
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,946
Okay, let's go.

607
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:59,950
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

608
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:57,866
留在那里

609
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,901
注意街上

610
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,247
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

611
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:03,200
马龙呢?

612
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:04,936
他在监视嫌疑犯,马上就到

613
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:06,882
他是谁
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

614
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,017
他是我们的人,没问题的

615
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:13,046
好吧,送他们到车站
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

616
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:14,723
到了后告诉我一声

617
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,448
- 是的,长官
- 帽子脱下来
Take off your hat.

618
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,020
发生什么事就先开枪,明白吗?
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

619
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,254
是的,奈斯先生
Yes, Mr. Ness.

620
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,228
Kiss.

621
00:45:28,704 --> 00:45:31,332
擦擦鼻子,爸爸
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

622
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:36,433
走吧
Now, go!

623
00:45:59,602 --> 00:46:00,591
马龙
Malone!

624
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:03,272
你没事吧
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

625
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:05,201
很好,那个警察没问题吧
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

626
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:06,973
应该没问题,他是我表弟

627
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:10,544
我要抓那个人,马龙你听到了吗?
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

628
00:46:10,913 --> 00:46:13,780
我要开始战斗,我要打击卡彭
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

629
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:16,679
那么圣诞快乐,因为我有个好消息
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

630
00:46:16,886 --> 00:46:20,151
- 告诉他吧
- 将有大批私货运来

631
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:19,988
A huge international
shipment's coming.

632
00:46:20,356 --> 00:46:23,189
我们知道时间、地点以及整个作业
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

633
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:27,089
那我们还等什么
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

634
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:31,395
你哪里来的消息
How do you come by this information?

635
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,431
那是警察工作的第二课
That's the second rule
of police work:

636
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,498
如果你想保守秘密,就别告诉头儿
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

637
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:45,403
他每年黑的钱超过三百万元
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

638
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:48,149
但他没交税,因为不是以他的名义
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

639
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:50,342
如果我们能确认他收到任何一笔钱
If we can establish
any payments to him,

640
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:52,953
我们就可告他逃税
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

641
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:55,180
什么?
What?

642
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:58,450
我说我们可告他逃税
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

643
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:02,958
以逃税罪名控告杀人凶手
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

644
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,157
好过没有
Well, it's better than nothing.

645
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:10,622
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

646
00:47:07,136 --> 00:47:09,730
好吧,要怎么做到

647
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:13,402
我不知道
I don't know.

648
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:17,880
Go to sleep, Oscar.

649
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,903
去睡觉吧

650
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:07,804
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey

651
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:08,427
有五到十辆卡车满载加拿大威士忌

652
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:11,683
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organization.

653
00:48:08,631 --> 00:48:11,794
由卡彭组织中的好手交易

654
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:15,528
他携带现金当场交易
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

655
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:21,038
交易地点在边界,美国这一边
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

656
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:24,808
我们的目标是没收私酒和现款
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

657
00:48:25,347 --> 00:48:26,405
队长
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

658
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:29,108
我们会等他们的信号

659
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,811
当他们上路后信号发出
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

660
00:48:33,022 --> 00:48:36,753
我们将由加拿大那边攻击桥那一端
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

661
00:48:37,026 --> 00:48:38,926
出其不意攻击他们背后
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

662
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:42,359
奈斯先生,突击就已赢得了一半的胜利
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr. Ness, is half the battle.

663
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:48,365
突击只赢了一半
很多事只是一半还不够
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

664
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:51,515
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

665
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:50,562
还有一半机会会输,我们要赢得全部

666
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:54,472
各位,向他们开战吧
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

667
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:55,970
谢谢你,队长
Thank you, Captain.

668
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:02,181
好,出发
All right! Move out!

669
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:26,035
别紧张,别紧张,船到桥头自然直
Take it easy.

670
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,258
Take it easy!
It'll all happen in time.

671
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,006
这就是工作,别期待它发生
This is the job.

672
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,849
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

673
00:49:32,214 --> 00:49:36,810
不希望它发生
只是等着看发生了什么事

674
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,685
Just watch what does happen.

675
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:39,787
你是我的导师?
Are you my 'tutor'?

676
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:44,258
是的,我是的
Yes, sir, that I am.

677
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:48,686
你检查过了吗
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

678
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:51,457
- 是的
- 那就别再碰了
Then leave it alone.

679
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:54,593
你是个好警察
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

680
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:58,272
你很不错,你会干得很好的
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

681
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:03,344
华莱士,你冷吗
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

682
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,007
有一点

683
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:09,116
不断的跺脚,会使你暖和
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

684
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:11,817
那是我20年巡夜的经验
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

685
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:16,683
Stitches and standing in the rain...

686
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:16,255
站在风雪、大雨中学来的

687
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:47,755
听我说,奈斯先生
Listen, Mr. Ness...

688
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:51,886
我有个主意
I had an idea.

689
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:50,152
You all have your spare shells?

690
00:51:47,616 --> 00:51:49,277
你们都带好弹药了

691
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:09,562
如果要开枪的话,卧倒,不要留情
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

692
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,299
And put your man down.

693
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:16,709
把对手干掉,因为他们也想要你的命

694
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:17,471
Because he'll do the same to you.

695
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,438
枪枪致命,听到了吗
Shoot to kill.

696
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,478
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

697
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:23,810
是的,听到了,枪枪致命

698
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:27,477
出发
Let's go.

699
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:53,507
放松
Easy...

700
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:57,219
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

701
00:52:54,316 --> 00:52:57,308
加拿大人在我发出信号前不会出现

702
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:01,421
所以我们要尽快冲到桥上
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

703
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:02,933
George, the count's right.

704
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,451
乔治,看来没错,数目正确

705
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,436
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

706
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:07,060
我担心的不是数目
我担心的是酒桶的大小

707
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:09,314
Malone, you and I will
take the men...

708
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:09,127
马龙,我们俩

709
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:12,800
加拿大骑警…乔治,快走
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

710
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:16,259
把货留下!
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

711
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,448
Charge!

712
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:20,039
冲啊!

713
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,101
管他的,人总免不了一死
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'.

714
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:29,835
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

715
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:29,007
他们来了…离开这儿

716
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,583
快,快!

717
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,004
Move, move!

718
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:43,849
Let's go!

719
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:49,521
I can't believe it!

720
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:50,137
真不敢相信

721
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,774
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

722
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:51,897
帐本,给我

723
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,273
别让车子下桥
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

724
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:15,797
- 斯通,拦住第一辆车
- 收到
Stone, take the first car!

725
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,676
Get this shit out of the way!

726
00:54:39,555 --> 00:54:41,489
混球!
Tough guy!

727
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:45,382
斯通
Stone!

728
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,246
Go!

729
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:50,523
斯通
Stone!

730
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:53,594
我没事
I'm okay.

731
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:57,569
凶手们!
You thugs!

732
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,355
You all right?

733
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:14,417
- 你没事吧?
- 是的

734
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:16,441
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

735
00:55:14,957 --> 00:55:16,584
他在那里,去抓他

736
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:33,166
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

737
00:55:29,605 --> 00:55:32,733
好了,别再跑了

738
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:37,076
乔治小子,这是什么
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

739
00:55:38,614 --> 00:55:40,639
问你呢
Hello.

740
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:04,526
好了,把枪丢下
All right! Drop the gun!

741
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,593
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

742
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:06,598
把手举起来,你被捕了

743
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:09,595
我说了,枪丢下
I said, drop it!

744
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:13,141
Stop!

745
00:57:18,614 --> 00:57:20,639
你没听见我的话吗
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

746
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,247
你是聋子吗
What are you, deaf?!

747
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:27,072
What is this, a game?!

748
00:57:25,587 --> 00:57:27,487
这只是游戏吗

749
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:55,100
Here. Sit down.

750
00:57:54,883 --> 00:57:55,850
坐下

751
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:06,570
Stone's gonna be all right.

752
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:08,420
斯通不要紧,我抓到拿手提袋的人

753
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:09,740
I got the fellow with the satchel.

754
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:17,932
我不得不杀他
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

755
00:58:18,206 --> 00:58:21,039
对,他死的像恺撒
(恺撒遇刺时自以为刀枪不入)

756
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:21,793
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

757
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,978
你希望死的是你吗
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

758
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:27,375
不,我才不要

759
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:31,595
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

760
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:28,947
那你已经尽到责任了

761
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:30,641
今晚可回去好好睡觉

762
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:35,057
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

763
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:35,413
你已失去了你的保护

764
00:58:35,624 --> 00:58:38,354
你现在离南区远得很,乔治
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

765
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:42,814
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

766
00:58:39,695 --> 00:58:40,992
我在和你说话

767
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:42,754
你是来此开战的吗?

768
00:58:42,964 --> 00:58:46,900
我要你写出你老板和你连络人的姓名
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

769
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:49,764
你去吻我的臭屁吧
Why don't you kiss my ass?

770
00:58:50,238 --> 00:58:51,603
也许你没听懂
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

771
00:58:51,807 --> 00:58:54,799
- 艾略特
- 你射击联邦官员违反禁酒令
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!

772
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,875
你可能会被关上三十年
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

773
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,240
你可以在里面待上一辈子
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

774
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:00,813
你喜欢那样吗

775
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,793
- Eliot!
- What?!

776
00:59:01,383 --> 00:59:02,509
什么事?

777
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:04,309
看这个
Look at this!

778
00:59:05,887 --> 00:59:07,013
你看
- Look at this!
- What is this?

779
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:11,955
那是什么?那是什么?

780
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:12,469
What is this?

781
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:15,760
你这帐本上有许多钱转出
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

782
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:21,478
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'?

783
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:21,267
这是什么意思,“战争”“警察分局”?

784
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,707
还有这个“巡回法庭”是什么意思
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'.

785
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:30,644
“巡回法庭”是什么意思
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court'. What is this?

786
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:33,948
没什么,你不会明白的
Nothin'. There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

787
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:37,710
如果我们能证明这些钱是付给卡彭的话
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

788
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,079
then we can put Capone away.

789
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:39,284
我们就能将卡彭绳之以法

790
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,752
告诉我们,哪一些钱是付给卡彭的?
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

791
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:43,481
A是卡彭的代号吗?

792
00:59:43,692 --> 00:59:46,252
除非你帮助我们不然你会坐一辈子牢
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

793
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:48,759
我要你将这些代号翻译出来
Translate this ledger for us!

794
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:51,262
- 去你的
- 去你的?
- In hell.
- In hell?!

795
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:53,792
放聪明点,老兄
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

796
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,093
除非你合作不然你会被高高的吊死

797
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:59,183
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

798
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:59,533
这个人可指证卡彭,使卡彭入狱

799
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:01,934
你们去死吧
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

800
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:05,974
我懒得跟你说了
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

801
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:09,148
我们总有方法问出来的

802
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,110
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

803
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:13,183
你会说的,你会求我让你招供

804
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,113
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

805
01:00:13,386 --> 01:00:15,251
你这个下流胚子
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

806
01:00:15,722 --> 01:00:17,053
别这样

807
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,372
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

808
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:22,861
起来,你,站起来

809
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,918
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

810
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:25,663
我要你替我译这本帐簿

811
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:28,128
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

812
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:28,624
我不会问你第二次

813
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:30,506
I'm gonna count to three.

814
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:30,727
我只数到三

815
01:00:32,872 --> 01:00:35,500
怎么了?嘴里有支枪就说不出话了?
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

816
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:39,389
One.

817
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:39,906
一

818
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,521
Two!

819
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,514
二

820
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,778
三
Three.

821
01:00:48,988 --> 01:00:52,082
好,我愿意说

822
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:51,527
I'm gonna talk!

823
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:56,323
Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

824
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:56,388
不,我什么都招,你们要知道什么

825
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:02,993
他说完后,才让他清洁
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

826
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,137
现在想知道什么就问他吧
Now, ask him what you want to know.

827
01:01:07,106 --> 01:01:08,167
好了
All right... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

828
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
我要知道记帐员的姓名

829
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:12,799
我要你将代号全译出来
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete...

830
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:15,098
我要完全的

831
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:16,735
奈斯先生
Mister Ness!

832
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:27,142
我不赞成你的做法
I do not approve of your methods!

833
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:31,413
是吗?你不是从芝加哥来的
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

834
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:38,389
- 什么?
- 他们把货没收了
- What?
- They got the shipment.

835
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:40,859
- 什么?
- 他们把所有的货都没收了
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

836
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:44,119
我要那个混蛋没命,我要他死
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...

837
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:45,729
我要他死,不管怎么做

838
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:48,492
搞什么?我问过你打算做什么吗
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

839
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:50,259
我问过你,你打算怎么做吗

840
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:53,697
我要你除掉他的人
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

841
01:01:53,906 --> 01:01:55,567
我要你找出他的住处

842
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:58,369
我要他死,我要他全家死光

843
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:59,887
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

844
01:01:58,578 --> 01:02:02,480
我要在他的骨灰上撒尿,
我要他知道厉害

845
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,389
I want to piss on his ashes!

846
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:07,853
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

847
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:06,045
看看他,这小家伙

848
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:08,184
他好严肃

849
01:02:08,388 --> 01:02:10,049
他脑子里在想很多事
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

850
01:02:10,723 --> 01:02:12,384
- 是吗
- 是的

851
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:13,483
- Yes.
- Like what?

852
01:02:12,592 --> 01:02:13,650
想什么

853
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:17,129
想他叫什么名字
Like what his name is.

854
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:21,074
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

855
01:02:17,697 --> 01:02:21,292
约翰,不是说好了吗?
约翰,我们都喜欢这名字

856
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:23,765
奈斯,他该叫朗恩
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

857
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:31,137
不,叫艾得格,叫J.艾得格
No... it'll be Edgar.

858
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:32,961
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.

859
01:02:31,344 --> 01:02:32,777
我觉得不好

860
01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:38,214
老天,你真美
God, you're beautiful.

861
01:02:40,853 --> 01:02:43,219
你昨晚来看我们会更美
You should have seen us last night.

862
01:02:45,258 --> 01:02:48,489
我知道,我该来,我想来
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

863
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:51,926
我知道,我了解,真的
I know. I understand, I do.

864
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:55,598
只要你小心就好
Just tell me, are you being careful?

865
01:02:56,402 --> 01:02:57,596
我小心得像老鼠一样
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

866
01:02:57,804 --> 01:02:59,738
有进展吗

867
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:01,902
进展?
- Progress?
- Yes?

868
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:06,671
奈斯太太,我想你先生逮到卡彭了
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

869
01:03:15,388 --> 01:03:22,487
先生们,今天上午地检处控告卡彭先生
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone

870
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:24,847
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading

871
01:03:23,296 --> 01:03:29,132
罪名是漏税及图谋逃税

872
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:28,600
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

873
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,937
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

874
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:30,563
卡彭先生会判刑多久?

875
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:35,798
如果所有罪名成立,卡彭可判二十八年

876
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:36,233
Mr. Capone could have
up to 28 years.

877
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:37,668
失陪了
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

878
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:43,745
他是卡彭的手下吗

879
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,975
可以多讲一点吗

880
01:03:46,452 --> 01:03:48,545
好了,我们走,车子在巷子里
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

881
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:50,722
到了之后,别接电话

882
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:52,850
- 我们来时,让铃声…
- 响二次
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.

883
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:54,526
- 我们会打电话…
- 在拐角处
- We'll call...
- From the corner.

884
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:56,791
- 有人敲门的话就…
- 开枪射击,我都知道

885
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:58,714
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

886
01:03:56,996 --> 01:03:58,520
- 都记住了
- 记住了

887
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:01,362
看来你很喜欢执法的工作
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

888
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:03,694
是,比当会计有趣多了

889
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,928
Much more diverting
than accounting.

890
01:04:05,471 --> 01:04:07,234
我对你们好,你们也要回报我
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

891
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,670
我们有协议,我们会遵守的,好吗?
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

892
01:04:16,716 --> 01:04:19,150
对的,比当会计有意思多了
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

893
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:21,110
好,晚上见
Okay, we see yous tonight.

894
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:24,249
好了,一直下去中间不停
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

895
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:38,135
他能说:我会大声地说
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

896
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:43,534
我得赞扬艾略特.奈斯
For which I must commend
the excellent work

897
01:04:43,743 --> 01:04:47,372
和他队伍的出色表现
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

898
01:04:50,116 --> 01:04:51,743
恭喜,是男孩还是女孩?
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

899
01:04:51,951 --> 01:04:53,251
- 男孩
- 恭喜

900
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,521
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

901
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:54,378
叫什么名字

902
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:55,554
约翰

903
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:56,779
约翰
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

904
01:04:57,623 --> 01:04:58,920
是的,约翰.詹姆斯

905
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:01,282
她好吧
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

906
01:05:01,494 --> 01:05:05,453
她很好,她说她出院后要油漆房子

907
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:05,948
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

908
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:08,795
再下来她会嫌房子小,你就必须搬家
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

909
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:10,229
不错

910
01:05:10,903 --> 01:05:14,304
结婚真不错
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

911
01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:15,838
如果你能忍受痛苦的话

912
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,031
伯恩先生
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

913
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:18,710
华莱士呢?你见到他们吗?

914
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:23,507
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

915
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:20,572
他刚从货物电梯下去

916
01:05:22,915 --> 01:05:24,314
很好

917
01:05:24,984 --> 01:05:30,047
- 必须随时警戒,我了解他们
- 别紧张
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

918
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,223
They are going to...

919
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:41,933
- 他是说搭货物电梯?
- 是的
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

920
01:05:48,774 --> 01:05:50,036
华莱士,华莱士
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

921
01:05:50,243 --> 01:05:51,835
走楼梯

922
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:34,453
Oh, no.

923
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:37,613
不
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!

924
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:39,620
别冲动,别冲动

925
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,669
Oscar.

926
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:02,510
“动摇”

927
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,919
Oh, Jesus.

928
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:24,001
天啊

929
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,932
你没事吧
You gonna be all right?

930
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:42,115
奈斯先生

931
01:07:50,796 --> 01:07:54,163
看到自己人躺在那里,心里实在很难过
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

932
01:07:56,836 --> 01:07:59,327
我恨见到这事发生在我认识的人身上
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

933
01:08:00,373 --> 01:08:03,774
有时候,置身事外最明智
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

934
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:11,405
吉米,请一天假离开市区,懂我意思吧?
Jimmy!

935
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:09,965
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

936
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:12,217
You know what I mean?

937
01:08:29,502 --> 01:08:30,560
艾尔卡彭
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr. Capone...

938
01:08:30,803 --> 01:08:32,771
- 我们这里没有卡彭先生
- 叫他,叫他

939
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:34,948
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr. Capone...

940
01:08:32,972 --> 01:08:36,806
- 我们这里没有卡彭先生
- 我说了…

941
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,034
I said...

942
01:08:43,883 --> 01:08:45,180
你有事吗
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

943
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:47,150
我的朋友今天被杀了

944
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,748
干我屁事
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

945
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:54,256
不干你的事?现在有关了

946
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:55,135
Now he does.

947
01:08:55,594 --> 01:08:57,255
来吧,卡彭,你要打吗
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

948
01:08:57,463 --> 01:09:01,490
你要打吗?你和我就在这里,来呀

949
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,225
That's it, come on!

950
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:05,498
怎么了,别躲在爪牙背后不敢自己站出来?
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

951
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:07,729
你想现在干是不是,你要现在来吗?
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

952
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,430
来呀,你这狗娘养的

953
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:11,172
- 什么?
- 冷静
- What?
- Easy.

954
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:13,611
你在我手下面前那样骂我
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

955
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:15,739
干他妈的你和你家人

956
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:21,036
Easy. It's me. It's me!

957
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:20,876
是我,是我

958
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:22,952
这样不行
Not this way.

959
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:25,120
你什么都没有,我知道
You fuck, you got nothin'!
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

960
01:09:25,324 --> 01:09:27,554
你来此是因为你没有证据

961
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:31,755
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!

962
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,694
你没有证物,没有簿记员

963
01:09:29,895 --> 01:09:32,056
你什么都没有,什么都没有

964
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:33,856
你要是男子汉的话就现在来干
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin', you punk!

965
01:09:34,066 --> 01:09:36,432
你一无所有,混球

966
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:48,242
不,我…我了解
Well, no, I understand.

967
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:51,710
相信我,我了解
Believe me, I understand.

968
01:09:59,558 --> 01:10:00,718
怎么回事?
Well, what's happened?

969
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:06,890
他说他不能没有证据
He says he can't be unprotected.

970
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:11,666
他究竟怎么说的
What is it that the guy says?

971
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:16,798
他说他不愿意让自己出丑
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

972
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:18,594
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

973
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:22,375
没有证人,所以他要撤回他的控诉

974
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:23,056
So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will
announce that he's dropping the case.

975
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:24,306
他要放弃
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

976
01:10:24,517 --> 01:10:27,247
我没那样说,我是说没有证人他不愿开庭

977
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:29,478
我们有华莱士的档案和那帐本
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

978
01:10:29,688 --> 01:10:32,987
有时候你得承认失败

979
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:33,901
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

980
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:36,423
喂
Hello?

981
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:40,459
喂
Hello.

982
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:44,291
是的
Yes.

983
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:50,673
他没有家人
No, he didn't have a family.

984
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,306
情形如何?
How is everything there?

985
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:02,888
No, you do it however you want.

986
01:11:00,085 --> 01:11:03,350
不,你看着办就行了

987
01:11:05,191 --> 01:11:09,787
我保证我会的,代我问候他
I promise I will.

988
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,604
You give her my love.

989
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:12,091
我也爱你
I love you, too.

990
01:11:15,267 --> 01:11:18,964
奈斯先生,这本帐本有费用支出
Mr. Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

991
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:22,072
牵涉芝加哥政府官员,也有卡彭那批人…

992
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:24,326
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.

993
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:24,435
今天到此为止,明天再说吧

994
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:28,704
斯通,就这样了,谢谢
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.

995
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:31,007
我要求留下来
I'd like to request to stick around.

996
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:35,213
我们要逮住那些人
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

997
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:36,888
我知道

998
01:11:45,497 --> 01:11:46,691
就此结束了吗?
Is that it?

999
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,558
你说什么?
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

1000
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:51,133
你听见我的话了

1001
01:11:51,403 --> 01:11:54,167
我在问,我们就此结束吗
My question is, are we done?

1002
01:11:55,808 --> 01:11:57,400
是的,我想是的
Yes, I think we're done.

1003
01:11:58,377 --> 01:12:01,278
你是说我们是输的一方
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

1004
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,846
似乎是如此,对华莱士来说的确是这样
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr. Wallace.

1005
01:12:04,049 --> 01:12:06,540
他死了,检察官要撤销案子
He's dead! And the D.A.
Is gonna drop the case!

1006
01:12:06,752 --> 01:12:09,983
没有证人他不愿起诉
He will not go into court
without a witness

1007
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:12,040
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

1008
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:12,180
没有卡彭的簿记员他不愿起诉的

1009
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:14,086
那你现在打算怎么办
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

1010
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:15,817
你希望我怎么做

1011
01:12:17,396 --> 01:12:19,626
我已尽力了
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

1012
01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:37,012
- 你太太要干什么?
- 她要知道我是否…
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...

1013
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:40,577
我太太?
- My wife?
- Yeah.

1014
01:12:40,853 --> 01:12:42,013
对

1015
01:12:46,225 --> 01:12:48,523
她想知道事情是否顺利
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

1016
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:52,889
结婚真不错吧
It's nice being married, eh?

1017
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:56,025
是啊
Yes.

1018
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:59,735
她在那里由一群陌生人保护着
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

1019
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:04,170
只能在想厨房该漆什么颜色
going over...
kitchen color charts or something.

1020
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:15,545
谁在乎厨房该漆什么色
Some part of the world still cares
what color the kitchen is.

1021
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,463
艾略特,我要你再为我做一件事
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

1022
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,295
去检察官那里拖延这案子
Get back to the D.A. And stall him.

1023
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:33,900
等一下,怎么个拖延
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

1024
01:13:34,106 --> 01:13:36,404
照我的话去做就是了

1025
01:13:39,745 --> 01:13:41,940
我知道怎么找出那家伙
I think I know how to find this guy.

1026
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:43,944
“卡彭簿记员被传唤”

1027
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:50,653
沃尔特,艾尔说要我们到外地去避避风头
Walter?

1028
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:52,057
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

1029
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:53,889
我们今晚动身
We're leavin' tonight.

1030
01:13:58,263 --> 01:14:00,163
两球入袋
Two ball, down.

1031
01:14:05,204 --> 01:14:06,535
迈克,你有空吗
Mike, you got a minute?

1032
01:14:08,006 --> 01:14:09,564
现在有了
I do now, don't I?

1033
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:15,175
你到警察俱乐部干嘛
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

1034
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:17,872
这里只有警察能来
This is a place for cops.

1035
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:21,115
到外面去谈如何
Can we step outside?

1036
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:25,014
好…但我和你无话可说
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

1037
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,059
你要去哪里?游泳吗
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

1038
01:14:32,297 --> 01:14:34,424
外面在下雨,笨蛋

1039
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:40,028
什么事?
What? What?!

1040
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:43,898
我想再要一件情报
I just need one more
piece of information.

1041
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:45,133
再一件
One more? Jimmy!

1042
01:14:45,344 --> 01:14:48,211
吉米,我已为你冒了生命危险

1043
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,366
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

1044
01:14:48,414 --> 01:14:50,814
我需要找出那个簿记员

1045
01:14:52,684 --> 01:14:55,949
你疯了!你是疯了
Are you crazy? You're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

1046
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:58,786
我曾警告你要离开

1047
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:00,253
如果他们知道是我的话我就死定了
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

1048
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:02,654
我必须找到那簿记员

1049
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:07,059
你简直就疯了,你疯了
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

1050
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,767
我还想救你的命
And I tried to save your life.

1051
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:12,459
把手拿开
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.

1052
01:15:13,705 --> 01:15:15,696
你欠我,吉米,我可什么也不欠你

1053
01:15:15,908 --> 01:15:17,341
我的人被杀了
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

1054
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:18,703
你的人,我们才是同志

1055
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,503
- 你是我的同志?
- 是的
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

1056
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:24,409
你和他们同流合污使得这城市败坏

1057
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:28,416
十年来,我无法抬头挺胸以当警察为傲
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

1058
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,214
狗屎,一派胡言
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

1059
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:33,550
看看你,看看你自己

1060
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:38,755
去做你的英雄梦吧
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

1061
01:15:39,031 --> 01:15:41,932
穿着便衣和联邦专员办案

1062
01:15:42,134 --> 01:15:43,533
你想他还能怎么办
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

1063
01:15:43,735 --> 01:15:45,635
他是想清理这城市

1064
01:15:46,138 --> 01:15:47,799
我要知道那簿记员在哪里
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

1065
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,268
我现在就要知道

1066
01:15:50,576 --> 01:15:52,271
否则我要把你这辈子
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

1067
01:15:52,478 --> 01:15:54,343
干的丑事全揭出来

1068
01:15:54,546 --> 01:15:56,343
我要告发你
I'm gonna turn you over!

1069
01:15:57,583 --> 01:16:00,848
- 你不想活了
- 是吗?
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

1070
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:04,415
你死定了
You're dead.

1071
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:31,945
你以为你是谁,我现在就宰掉你
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

1072
01:16:29,423 --> 01:16:32,259
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'.

1073
01:16:41,293 --> 01:16:47,061
少说狠话了,你想进医院还是坟场
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

1074
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:47,149
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

1075
01:16:47,599 --> 01:16:49,965
要怎么拖延?我根本无法成立此案
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

1076
01:16:50,168 --> 01:16:53,797
有何依据?我不打算起诉,我可不想闹笑话
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...

1077
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:59,171
别说你会闹笑话,
我的人正在外面冒生命危险
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

1078
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,286
I have men out there
risking more than that.

1079
01:16:59,478 --> 01:17:04,347
我们有线索,我们正循线索去追查
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead

1080
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:07,169
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

1081
01:17:05,684 --> 01:17:07,413
你现在绝不能放弃

1082
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:10,414
是的,斯通
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

1083
01:17:10,622 --> 01:17:13,250
- 奈斯呢?
- 他在检察官的办公室

1084
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,091
<i>He's at the D.A.'s.</i>

1085
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,291
告诉他我知道佩恩下落
叫他马上到我这里来
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

1086
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:37,241
- Al! Al!
- Mr. Capone!

1087
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:39,608
艾尔.卡彭先生,出庭的事如何
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.

1088
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:45,619
我告诉你们,谁和我捣蛋我就要他好看

1089
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,208
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

1090
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:50,587
有人偷我东西,我就骂他是小偷
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole',

1091
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:52,821
我不会理会这种人
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

1092
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:55,561
你们明白吗
You understand?

1093
01:17:56,301 --> 01:18:00,761
我没有伤害那些人
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

1094
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:03,669
但他们生我的气,所以他们如何做?
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

1095
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:08,539
他们便扯出交税问题,他们根本没证据
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

1096
01:18:09,114 --> 01:18:13,175
好使我恼怒,他们像男子汉吗?不是

1097
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:13,360
To speak to me like men? No.

1098
01:18:13,385 --> 01:18:16,843
竟要逮捕一位讲和平的人
To harass a peaceful man.

1099
01:18:17,923 --> 01:18:22,587
我向上帝祈祷,可以的话我只要求些自尊
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

1100
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:23,537
I would have
just a little more self respect.

1101
01:18:22,794 --> 01:18:24,591
卡彭先生

1102
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,557
我再告诉你们一件事
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

1103
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:31,497
一场战斗要等到战斗结束后

1104
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:33,255
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

1105
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:34,171
只剩一个人站着,那时才知道谁是赢家

1106
01:18:42,147 --> 01:18:45,480
“拉辛路”

1107
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:55,821
“拉辛路,1634号”

1108
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:27,175
真是不知好歹,用刀来对付枪
Isn't that just like a wop?

1109
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:27,054
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

1110
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:34,018
滚出去,你这混蛋
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

1111
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:37,418
快点,快滚
Go on, get your ass out of here!

1112
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:21,319
枪声,我听到枪声
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

1113
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,026
退后,大家退后,快
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

1114
01:23:25,063 --> 01:23:27,156
绕到后面
Round the back.

1115
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:37,836
马龙
Malone!

1116
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,772
马龙
Malone.

1117
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:14,042
天,斯通…斯通
Goddamn! Stone!

1118
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:18,046
斯通
Stone!

1119
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,437
The phone!

1120
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:27,109
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

1121
01:24:25,323 --> 01:24:26,950
叫救护车

1122
01:24:27,993 --> 01:24:32,862
我是斯通,财政部的
派救护车至拉辛路1634号
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

1123
01:24:33,832 --> 01:24:35,231
什么?
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

1124
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:38,262
你要这个
This? You want this?

1125
01:24:38,636 --> 01:24:39,864
你要这个

1126
01:24:44,442 --> 01:24:46,433
你要这个
You want this?

1127
01:24:53,485 --> 01:24:54,645
什么?
What?

1128
01:25:02,394 --> 01:25:04,438
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

1129
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:07,733
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?

1130
01:25:07,365 --> 01:25:09,458
那个簿记员?簿记员

1131
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:11,153
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

1132
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:16,497
簿记员,他搭这班火车,他搭这班火车?
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

1133
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:16,950
He's on this train.

1134
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:21,538
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

1135
01:25:19,177 --> 01:25:21,702
你打算怎么办

1136
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:27,002
No. Malone. No.

1137
01:25:27,285 --> 01:25:31,585
撑着
Stay. Stay.

1138
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:32,591
Stay! Malone...

1139
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:35,587
马龙!不

1140
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:34,843
No. No, no!

1141
01:25:36,637 --> 01:25:40,140
Not this... Not this man...

1142
01:26:06,057 --> 01:26:08,992
到迈阿密的火车十二时五分开出
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr. Ness.

1143
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,929
我们会赶到的
We'll be there.

1144
01:26:16,434 --> 01:26:20,928
死的簿记员对我们没用,斯通
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

1145
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:22,724

Cover the south entrance.

1149
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:26,893

1168
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:05,202
谢谢你,先生

1169
01:31:02,588 --> 01:31:06,008
Are you all right? Thank you.

1170
01:31:08,144 --> 01:31:11,238
你真好心,肯帮助我
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

1171
01:31:10,888 --> 01:31:14,892
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

1172
01:31:11,848 --> 01:31:14,146
我担心自己是否能办到

1173
01:31:18,722 --> 01:31:22,749
- 有问题吗?我来帮你
- 不用
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

1174
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:25,777
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

1175
01:31:23,059 --> 01:31:26,324
我真的很感谢你

1176
01:31:30,467 --> 01:31:34,665
你真可爱
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

你真好,真谢谢你
Thank you again,

1178
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:43,504
Thank you, sir.

1179
01:31:52,522 --> 01:31:59,018

Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

1182
01:32:08,904 --> 01:32:12,533
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

1183
01:32:09,472 --> 01:32:12,839
别哭,宝宝,我们快到家了

1184
01:32:14,144 --> 01:32:18,444
有什么不对吗?先生
Is something wrong?

1185
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:18,539
Sir?

1186
01:34:14,764 --> 01:34:16,823
快点!离开这里
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

1187
01:34:17,824 --> 01:34:21,370
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

1188
01:34:18,668 --> 01:34:21,603
- 你干什么?
- 闭嘴,走

1189
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:26,908
闭嘴
- What are you doin'?
- Shut the fuck up!

1190
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:29,044
别动

1191
01:34:27,626 --> 01:34:30,963
- Hold it!
- Please...

1192
01:34:29,779 --> 01:34:31,440
别动

1193
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:33,799
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

1194
01:34:31,714 --> 01:34:34,342
- 我的宝宝
- 别动,他没事

1195
01:34:36,686 --> 01:34:38,244
我说别动
I said hold it!

1196
01:34:40,123 --> 01:34:42,614
我要和簿记员一起走出去
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

1197
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:46,023
簿记员将和我驾车离开
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

1198
01:34:48,531 --> 01:34:53,935
如果他死了,你们就什么都没了
See? Or else he dies.

1199
01:34:50,524 --> 01:34:53,569
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'.

1200
01:34:56,989 --> 01:35:00,200
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

1201
01:34:57,507 --> 01:35:00,442
给你们五秒钟决定

1202
01:35:01,177 --> 01:35:03,805
我告诉你们…我告诉你们所想知道的一切
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'!

1203
01:35:04,013 --> 01:35:05,241
闭嘴

1204
01:35:05,448 --> 01:35:06,437
我不是说着玩

1205
01:35:06,649 --> 01:35:10,312
杀了他,我什么都告诉你们
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

1206
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,148
你瞄准他了
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

1207
01:35:12,455 --> 01:35:13,854
是的,我瞄准了

1208
01:35:18,728 --> 01:35:20,025
一
- One!
- Will you stop it!

1209
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:21,492
请你们制止他

1210
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:28,432
解决他
Take him.

1211
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,066
二
Two.

1212
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:04,524
这帐本上的记号代表了收付对象
The two coded entries
in this ledger

1213
01:36:02,095 --> 01:36:06,767
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

1214
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:08,752
包括了各级政府官员、警察人员

1215
01:36:06,975 --> 01:36:12,648
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

1216
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:12,693
还有艾尔卡彭,是不是

1217
01:36:14,635 --> 01:36:16,102
没错
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

1218
01:36:16,303 --> 01:36:17,395
你说什么

1219
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,973
你说得没错
I said that is correct.

1220
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:26,305
而你会替我们译出帐本上的代号
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

1221
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:30,650
是的
I will.

1222
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:33,250
对不起,佩恩先生,我听不到
Sorry, Mr. Payne, I can't hear you.

1223
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:35,348
是的,我会
I said, I will.

1224
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:40,285
你负责替卡彭先生管帐
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr. Capone?

1225
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:42,823
是的
Yes, I was.

1226
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:52,335
而你是亲自将那些
未报税的巨款交给卡彭先生
And you personally
distributed monies...

1227
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:50,185
...vast, undeclared monies...

1228
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:53,730
...to Mr. Capone?

1229
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:55,134
是的
Yes, I did.

1230
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,044
你能告诉我们总数吗?
Would you tell us the amounts?

1231
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:02,912
三年来
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr. Capone

1232
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:11,718
我亲自交给卡彭先生一百三十多万元

1233
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:12,040
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

1234
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:17,893
请你再重复一次
Would you repeat that amount, please?

1235
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:22,129
一百三十万美元
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

1236
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,770
谢谢你

1237
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:43,314
我不明白,卡彭为何有恃无恐
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

1238
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,220
他一直在微笑
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

1239
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,944
那家伙在法庭上带枪
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

1240
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:18,488
叫法警来
Get me the bailiff.

1241
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:23,695
很快会结束的
It'll be a fast trial.

1242
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:30,699
那个穿白西装的人身上带了把枪
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

1243
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,940
我不希望在此闹事,你叫他出去
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

1244
01:38:34,941 --> 01:38:36,468
是,先生

1245
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:45,175
请你出来一下好吗
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

1246
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:15,741
- 面对墙壁
- 你以为你是谁?
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

1247
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:18,009
你听到他的话了

1248
01:39:20,043 --> 01:39:23,797
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

1249
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:24,318
好了,把口袋掏空放在这里,全拿出来

1250
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:27,634
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

1251
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:27,255
- 我有带枪的许可
- 我看看

1252
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:33,063
遭起诉的人不是我
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

1253
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:34,666
把东西放在桌上

1254
01:39:38,187 --> 01:39:40,397
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

1255
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,864
把枪还他

1256
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:47,036
请给予弗兰克尼蒂先生一切的方便和工作
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

1257
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:46,945
"Mr. Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

1258
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,442
威廉汤姆森,芝加哥市长
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

1259
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,118
对不起,奈斯先生,你必须把枪还他
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

1260
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:58,948
好吧,但那家伙不准再进入法庭,你明白吗
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

1261
01:39:57,623 --> 01:40:00,792
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

1262
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:00,319
是的,长官

1263
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,584
“拉辛路1634号”

1264
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:36,960
拉辛路1634号,我曾有位朋友住在那里
1634 Racine... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

1265
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:53,638
不要,让他走
Don't. Let him go.

1266
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,181
不要
- No!
- Here, take it.

1267
01:45:10,437 --> 01:45:12,268
我在这里,财政官员
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

1268
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:15,908
来呀,逮捕我

1269
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:23,113
你在等什么,别光站在那里,逮捕我呀
What are you waitin' for?

1270
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,323
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

1271
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:29,313
别惹火了我
Don't push me.

1272
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:34,053
我要送你下地狱,老兄
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

1273
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:35,285
是吗

1274
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:40,432
没错,我要看你下狱,因为你杀了我朋友
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

1275
01:45:38,714 --> 01:45:40,883
'Cause you killed my friend!

1276
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:43,261
他死得像只猪一样
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

1277
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:44,928
你说什么

1278
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:48,835
我说你朋友死前哀号得像猪一样
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

1279
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:51,704
等我脱罪时,你慢慢想吧
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

1280
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,150
像你这样吗?
Did he sound anything like that?

1281
01:46:39,092 --> 01:46:40,992
拍张照,拍张照
One picture, come on, one picture.

1282
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:46,590
奈斯,看看这个
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.

1283
01:46:48,869 --> 01:46:50,496
奈斯先生
Mr. Ness?

1284
01:46:52,272 --> 01:46:53,933
奈斯先生,你还好吧?
Mr. Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

1285
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:55,964
你最好看看这个

1286
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:58,671
这是什么
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr. Ness.

1287
01:46:58,879 --> 01:47:01,677
这是陪审团名单,他们被收买了

1288
01:47:00,671 --> 01:47:02,464
They've been bribed.

1289
01:47:02,816 --> 01:47:04,579
从尼蒂西装里搜出来的
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

1290
01:47:05,352 --> 01:47:06,683
尼蒂呢?

1291
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:09,885
他在车上
He's in the car.

1292
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,708
这不构成证据,没有用
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...

1293
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:33,845
我可不准许

1294
01:47:33,537 --> 01:47:39,251
Your Honor, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

1295
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,743
庭上,这案子的事实是,
卡彭是个杀人凶手

1296
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,508
而你却要让他自由

1297
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:43,146
对付他这种人只有一种办法,
便是把他关起来
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

1298
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:49,055
我曾发誓,我要不计任何方法捉住被告
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

1299
01:47:49,262 --> 01:47:51,628
我很满意我所做的正确方法
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...

1300
01:47:51,832 --> 01:47:53,527
那个人必须被制止,而你一定要…

1301
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:57,328
我是法官,我会尽我的责任,奈斯先生
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

1302
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:08,812
请你们出去好吗
Would you excuse us?

1303
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:13,602
- 法警
- 是的
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

1304
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:20,879
我要你去隔壁霍法官的法庭
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

1305
01:49:21,087 --> 01:49:23,715
他们刚开始审理离婚案件
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

1306
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:27,426
我要你把他的陪审团带来
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

1307
01:49:27,627 --> 01:49:30,323
把这里的陪审团带过去

1308
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,589
你听清楚了吗
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

1309
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,597
是的,庭上

1310
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,561
他说什么
What's he talking about?

1311
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:44,473
- 我要你调换陪审团
- 是的
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

1312
01:49:44,678 --> 01:49:45,975
我抗议
Your Honor, I object!

1313
01:49:47,447 --> 01:49:48,675
驳回
Overruled.

1314
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:55,210
你是怎么说动他的
What did you tell him?

1315
01:49:57,057 --> 01:49:59,287
我说他的名字也在帐本上
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

1316
01:50:01,561 --> 01:50:03,188
但他的名字并不在帐本上
His name wasn't in the ledger!

1317
01:50:04,564 --> 01:50:07,431
怎么回事
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

1318
01:50:07,634 --> 01:50:09,124
请守秩序
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

1319
01:50:09,336 --> 01:50:10,234
我认为
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.

1320
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:12,132
我不管你认为什么,想点办法

1321
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:15,840
我看起来像什么?想点办法呀
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'!

1322
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,407
秩序
Order!

1323
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:25,308
庭上,我们撤回无罪申辩,改为有罪申辩
Your Honor, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

1324
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,501
and enter a plea of Guilty.

1325
01:50:29,087 --> 01:50:31,882
- Guilty?
- Order in the court!

1326
01:50:30,557 --> 01:50:33,492
维持庭上秩序,秩序

1327
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:34,134
Order!

1328
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:47,930
法警,维持秩序
Bailiff! Bailiff!

1329
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:48,607
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

1330
01:50:50,108 --> 01:50:51,443
Eliot!

1331
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:55,138
庭上,庭上,这公正吗
Your Honor!
Is that justice?

1332
01:50:55,348 --> 01:50:57,816
他为何调换陪审团?
Please, why did he switch the jury?

1333
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:00,780
你有何打算?你打算继续
Are you gonna go
after the organization?

1334
01:51:00,781 --> 01:51:02,153
借光
Excuse me.

1335
01:51:03,455 --> 01:51:06,750
I'm askin' Your Honor,
is this justice?

1336
01:51:06,893 --> 01:51:08,884
那是公正吗?

1337
01:51:11,464 --> 01:51:13,523
这样公正吗
Is this justice?

1338
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:20,339
绝不停止,绝不停止战斗,直到战斗终止
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

1339
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:21,837
你说什么
What did you say?

1340
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:25,440
我说绝不停止战斗,直到战斗停止为止
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

1341
01:51:25,143 --> 01:51:27,187
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

1342
01:51:25,745 --> 01:51:27,713
你听到我的话了,卡彭,都结束了

1343
01:51:27,396 --> 01:51:29,940
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

1344
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:30,115
滚开,你只会说大话

1345
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:33,051
最后一课
Here endeth the lesson.

1346
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:35,278
你只知道口出狂言
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

1347
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:40,826
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

1348
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:59,835
“不可动摇者打击罪犯”

1349
01:52:02,582 --> 01:52:04,914
“奈斯保证不被收买”

1350
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,110
“卡彭今天出庭”

1351
01:52:09,255 --> 01:52:13,589
“卡彭被判十一年徒刑”

1352
01:52:59,205 --> 01:53:00,695
太多暴力了
So much violence.

1353
01:54:07,607 --> 01:54:08,904
总算清理了一点
Cleaning up a little.

1354
01:54:18,551 --> 01:54:20,951
我想该说再见了
I guess this is goodbye.

1355
01:54:23,056 --> 01:54:24,387
再见,乔治
Goodbye, George.

1356
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:28,785
我要感谢你
I want to... thank you for this.

1357
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:33,528
不,谢谢你
No. Thank you.

1358
01:54:49,082 --> 01:54:52,643
奈斯先生,我认为他希望你能保有的
Mr. Ness... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

1359
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,020
不,他希望送给警察
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

1360
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:01,787
我要回家了
I'm going home.

1361
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:15,472
奈斯先生,奈斯先生
Mr. Ness!
Any comment for the record?

1362
01:55:15,675 --> 01:55:18,838
你对这标题有何意见
<捉拿卡彭下狱的人>

1363
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:19,378
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

1364
01:55:19,746 --> 01:55:22,044
我只是适逢其时而已
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

1365
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:29,814
- 听说禁酒令将取消,你会怎么做?
- 也许我会去喝上一杯
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

1366
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:28,679
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
