整个罗马军队。

帝王无法得到人民的支持。

从山丘上被遗弃以待死亡。

那只狼发现了它们，用她的奶哺育了它们。

你是在哪里学会你的手艺的？
Where did you learn your trade?

635
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
你问在哪里？
Where do you ask?

636
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,520
我曾手持沉重的武器。 我自己曾经是一个角斗士。
I got a heavy hand. I used to be a gladiator myself.

637
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,520
在你的巅峰状态下，你是否能打败我？
Would you have bested me in your prime course?

638
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,520
以你目前的状态，我现在能够击败你。
In your current state I could best you now.

639
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:39,520
幸运的是，我已放下了我的剑，所以我能将日子花在拯救生命上，而不是夺取生命。
Luckily for you I have put down my sword so I can spend my days saving lives instead of taking them.

640
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,520
我晚年是否有如此大的改变？
Am I such a change so late in life?

641
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,520
人在做，天在看。
What we do in life echoes in eternity.

642
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:54,520
我感觉我认识那些话。
I feel like I know those words.

643
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,520
我的记数信用写在角斗士骨骼墓碑之一上。
My counting credit is written on one of the tombs of the bones of a gladiator.

644
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,520
[角斗士被杀的声音]
[Sound of a gladiator being killed]

645
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
哎呀！
My!

646
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,520
冠军，你听到那些废话了吗？
Champion, did you hear that crap?

647
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:19,520
你听到那些废话了吗？
Did you hear that crap?

648
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,520
你有东西。
You have something.

649
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,520
我从一开始就知道。这个贾达夫塔。是的。
I know it from the start. The jadafta. Yes.

650
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:33,520
希腊人称之为提摩斯，烟雾，愤怒。
The Greeks call it timos, smoke, rage.

651
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,520
愤怒就是你的礼物。
And rage is your gift.

652
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:42,520
像伟大的阿喀琉斯一样，永远不要放弃它。
Like the great Achilles, never let it go.

653
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,520
它会带领你走向伟大，我的冠军。
It will carry you to greatness, my champion.

654
01:07:47,520 --> 01:08:06,520
[角斗士被杀的声音]
[Sound of a gladiator being killed]

655
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:14,520
谢谢你邀请我。这真是一种荣誉。
Thank you for inviting me. This is truly an honor.

656
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,520
[角斗士被杀死的声音]
[Sound of a gladiator being killed]

657
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,520
我听说你已经和法庭交谈过了。
I hear you have talked to the court.

658
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,520
是的。我们以前见过面。
Yes. We've met before.

659
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,520
我们见过面吗？很久以前。
Have we? Long ago.

660
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,520
在哪里？
Where?

661
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,520
我在这次非洲战役中，是您父亲军队的一员。
I was in the service of your father's army on this African campaign.

662
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,520
您曾与我父亲一同役职。
You served with my father.

663
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,520
哦。
Oh.

664
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,520
我有幸阅读了他的冥想。
I had the privilege of reading his meditations.

665
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:59,520
最好的报复是不似那伤害你的人。
The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.

666
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:09,520
我听说你一直在为整个帝国的一半军团武装，并且在罗马这里扩大势力。
I hear you've been arming half the legions in the entire empire and here, now, in Rome.

667
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,520
你通过赞助角斗士来增加自己的影响力。
You're gaining influence by sponsoring gladiators.

668
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,520
我做这些是出于对这项运动的热爱。
I do it for the love of the sport.

669
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,520
那你是从哪里找到这些角斗士的？
And where did you find these gladiators?

670
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,520
它们通常是战俘或流浪汉。
They're usually prisoners of war or vagrants.

671
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,520
你在问什么？
What do you ask?

672
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:33,520
一个人可以选择战斗并活下来。
A man can choose to fight and stay alive.

673
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,520
生活和竞技场中一样，不是吗？
It's the same in life as it is in the arena, is it not?

674
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
这是谁？
Who is this?

675
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,520
那是我父亲年轻时的样子。
That is my father as a youth.

676
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,520
她生了一个孩子。
She had a child.

677
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:53,520
众所周知 当普通消失时 那男孩也消失了。
It is common knowledge when commonness was killed the boy disappeared.

678
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
唉，谁会在意呢？
Well, who would care?

679
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
Silla 会在意。
Silla would care.

680
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,520
再来点酒！
More wine!

681
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,520
毕竟他是皇室的血脉。
He was of the royal bloodline after all.

682
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,520
他的父亲呢？
And his father?

683
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,520
表面上是卢修斯·维鲁斯。
Ostensibly, Lucius Verus.

684
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,520
你知道，这是一场包办的婚姻。她才十四岁。
You see, it was an arranged marriage. She was fourteen.

685
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,520
女性不是他的品味。
Females were not his taste.

686
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,520
不，我的一些日子。
No, mine some days.

687
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,520
不，不，不。据传说，你会发现，她有情人。
No, no, no. By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

688
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,520
而根据传闻，真正的父亲是科莫德斯。
And by rumor, the real father was Commodus.

689
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,520
兄弟之情，你懂的。
Brotherly love, you see.

690
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,520
如果他死了，就应该有遗体的。
If he died, there has to be remains.

691
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,520
如果他还活着，那他大概是...
And if he lived, that would make him about...

692
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,520
嗯，让我们算一下。他死时大约是十二岁。
Well, let's work it out. He was about twelve when he died.

693
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,520
那他就是...
So that would make him...

她是在你丈夫的命令下被杀害的。
She was killed under your husband's command.

710
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,520
罗马淹没在自己的鲜血中。
Rome drowns in its own blood.

711
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,520
尽管如此，你依然享受Conseal的乐趣。
And yet you enjoy the pleasures of the Conseal.

712
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,520
有很多你不明白的事情。
There is much you do not understand.

713
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:37,520
公爵夫人。

我不知道你认为我是谁。

我没有母亲，或者说没有我能记得的母亲。

01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:53,520
真的很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

718
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,520
如果您的儿子在这里，我敢肯定他会告诉您不要为他悲伤。
If your son were here, I feel sure he would tell you not to grieve him.

719
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,520
因为他已不再是您送走的那个男孩。那个男孩已经不在了。
For he would not be the boy that you sent away. That boy is dead.

720
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,520
您可能认为我毫无价值。
You may think I have little worth.

721
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,520
也许你认为我背叛了你。
You may think I betrayed you.

722
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,520
但我需要让你知道...
But I need you to know...

01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,520
走开。
Get out.

729

夫人，我们必须立刻离开。
My lady, we must go at once.

你确定吗？
Are you certain?

01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,520
是的。
Yes.

737
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,520
我认识我的儿子。
I know my son.

738

今晚我和他说过话。
I spoke to him tonight.

739
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:40,520
因为我的所作所为，也许他会与我失散。
He may be lost to me for what I did.

740
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,520

But he lives.

741
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,520
比赛的第三天是明天。
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

大多数战士都无法生存。

帮助他？
Help him?

是的。
Yes.

747
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,520
我爱他。
I love him.

748
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,520
我当时辜负了他。
I failed him then.

749
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,520
我知道我错了。
I know I did.

750

我现在不能再辜负他。
I cannot fail him now.

01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:11,520
军队是严峻的。
The army is an austere.

752
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,520
如果我们再等几天...
If we wait a few days...

753
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,520
那时他可能已经死了。
He could be dead by then.

754
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
阿格尼丝...
Agnes...

755
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,520
我愿意为大家献出我的生命。
I will willingly give my life for all.

756
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,520
但我不会放弃我的儿子。
But I will not give my son's.

757
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:34,520
一个！
One!

758

加油！
Go, go!

765
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,520
这样走不远的。
You won't get far like this.

766
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,520
只是他。
Just him.

767
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,520
你走。
You go.

768
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,520
走。
Go.

769
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,520
让我们看看你在没有团队的情况下能走多远。
Let's see how far you can go on your own without your team.

770
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,520
准备好了吗？
Ready?

771
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,520
一个！

772
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,520
再来一个！

再来一个！

更多！

留着吧。
Leave it.

777
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
走吧，走吧！
Go, go!

778
01:16:43,520 --> 01:17:04,520
只是醋，我的朋友。
Just vinegar, my friend.

779
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,520
你再也没有鸦片了。
There will be no more opium for you.

780
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,520
下辈子等着你的是更多的痛苦。
There is plenty of pain waiting for you in the next life.

781
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,520
我不知道你为什么这么贪吃。
I don't know why you are so greedy for eating this one.

782
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:23,520
拉维，你是个自由的人吗？
Are you a free man, Ravi?

783
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,520
自由？
Free?

784
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,520
我是。
I am.

785
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,520
我放下了我的剑，并发誓再也不拾起。
I laid down my sword and I swore never to pick it up again.

786
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,520
难道你选择了这个地狱吗？
Didn't you choose this hell?

787
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,520
之前你抱着什么希望？
What was your hope before?

788
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
我在问什么？
What I am asking?

789
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,520
为什么不回去呢？
Why don't you go back?

790
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,520
我希望我能。
I wish I could.

791
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:50,520
我不是一个女人。
I am not a woman.

792

总有一个女人。

总是。

她来自意大利的伦敦。

795
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,520
所以现在，我们的儿子，他们只会说拉丁语。

796

我的女儿的眼睛，和你一样蓝。

我在长大的时候听过我祖父的膝盖的传说。

他曾经谈论过那个错误的梦。

800
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:24,520
它是如此脆弱，只能轻声细语地说出来。

801
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,520
真是个放逐。
What a banish.

802
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,520
孩子，这是什么梦？
Son, what was this dream?

803
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,520
一个所有人都能在公平法律下生活并得到保护的罗马。

01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:50,520
你的祖父，听起来像是一个危险的人。
Your grandfather, he sounds like a dangerous man.

807
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:56,520
机会对你不利。
The odds are against you.

808
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,520
机会总是对我不利。
The odds are always against me.

809
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,520
别担心，老头。
Don't worry, old man.

810
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
你已经死了。
You are dead.

811
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:10,520
应该好好休息。
Should get some rest.

812
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,520
明天你的人会需要你来带领他们。
Your men will need you to lead them tomorrow.

813
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:32,520
这是关乎生存的！
This is about survival!

814
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520

817
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,520
愿指令准备好听取。

01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:13,240
啊，你的血液有多么蓝？
Ah, how blue is your blood?

1109
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:18,240
也许罗马的心脏就在那个胸膛里。
Perhaps the heart of a Roman feeds in that chest.

1110
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,240
罗马曾建造的最伟大的庙宇，是斗兽场。
The greatest temple Rome ever built, the Colosseum.

1111
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:32,240
因为这是他们所信仰的。权力。
Because this is what they believe in. Power.

1112
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:36,240
他们已经到这里观看强者打倒。
They got it here to watch the strong strike down.

1113
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,240
必须还有别的东西。没有别的了。
There has to be something else. There is nothing else.

1114
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,240
必须有另一个罗马。没有其他罗马了。
There has to be another Rome. There is no other Rome.

1115
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:45,240
梦想。罗马的梦想。
The dream. The dream of Rome.

1116
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,240
这是一个老人的幻想。
It's an old man's fantasy.

1117
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:51,240
你是谁？
Who are you?

1118
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,240
嗯。
Hmm.

1119
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:57,240
你在把名字换成罗马名之前叫什么？
What was your name before you traded it for a Roman one?

1120
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:00,240
你永远不会知道。
You'll never know.

1121
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:04,240
我有我的命运。
I have a destiny.

1122
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:10,240
众神把你送到我这里。
The gods delivered you to me.

1123
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:15,240
你会成为我的工具。
You will be my instrument.

1124
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,240
在这一生或下一世，我永远不会成为你的工具。
I will never be your instrument in this life or the next.

他和他的贱人可能会杀了我们。
He and his bitch will possibly kill us.

1131
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:01,240
难道你没听见吗？他们在呼唤我们的头颅。
Don't you hear them? They're calling for our heads.

1132
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,240
卫队将像以往一样镇压这种狂怒。
The Patorians will put down this crap like they have every other.

1133
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,240
是谁招惹了这场灾祸？
Who brought this on us?

1134
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,240
别以为我会！
Don't think I!

1135
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:18,240
也许你应该将这事带到其他地方，去安慰他。
Perhaps you should take down this elsewhere to comfort him.

1136
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:30,240
原谅我弟弟的发作。
Forgive my brother's outburst.

1137
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:34,240
侵袭他肾部的疾病正在扩散到他的大脑。
The disease that infects his loins is spreading his brain.

1138
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,240
每一天情况都变得更糟。
Every day gets worse.

1139
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,240

必须起床。必须走了。
Gotta get up. Gotta go.

01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:07,240
来吧，站起来。起来。起来。不是你。
Come on, stand up. Get up. Get up. Not you.

1145
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,240

怎么了？
What's the matter?

1148
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,240
从来没有属于我的东西。
Nothing's ever mine.

Even in the womb.

他试图弄伤我的肚脐。

好让我再也长不出头发来。

良心驱使我。
My conscience compels me.

为什么？

1161
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:48,240
但我没有做。
But I did not do it.

1162
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,240
嗯，街上发生的是混乱。
Well, what's happening in the streets is the chaos.

1163
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,240
他在撒谎。

没有比兄弟相互指责更毁灭性的证词了。
No testimony can be more damning than one brother against another.

01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,240
那是谎言。他总是说谎。
That's a lie. He always lies.

他可以很有说服力。

And after Rome falls, what then?

1258
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:46,240
你是你父亲的孩子。
You are your father's child.

1259
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:50,240
他对罗马的梦想从来不是一个梦想。
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

1260
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,240
那只是虚构。
It was a fiction.

1261
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:59,240
最好的报复是变得不同于伤害你的人。
The best revenge is to become unlike the one who did the injury.

1262
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:04,240
我已经使自己与你的父亲不同。
I have made myself unlike your father.

1263
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:07,240
他谈论梦想，我说真相。
He spoke of dreams, I speak of truth.

1264
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:12,240
在我的罗马，唯一的真相是我是你的父亲。
And the only truth in my Rome is that I am your father.

1265
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:16,240
在我的罗马，强者为法则。
In my Rome is the law of the strongest.

1266
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:23,240
我曾是皇帝的财产。
I was owned by an emperor.

1267
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:28,240
如今我掌控一座帝国。
Now I control an empire.

1268
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:32,240
除了在罗马，还能有何地方能让人实现这一切？
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

1269
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:42,240
你能认出你父亲在我身上的印记吗？
Do you recognize your father's mark on me?

1270
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:56,240
在这最后时刻，如果你需要任何东西，我们都会提供。
If there is anything you need in these last hours, we will provide.

1271
01:56:56,240 --> 01:57:05,240
你的死将铲除我通向王位的道路。
Your death will clear my path to the throne.

1272
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:14,240
明天将会有比赛，我会取胜。
Tomorrow there will be games and at them I will prevail.

1273
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:29,240
Ravi。
Ravi.

1274
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:38,240
你能在明天早上帮我传达一条信息给奥斯提亚吗？
Can you get me a message to Ostia by morning?

1275
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,240
奥斯提亚有什么？
What is in Ostia?

1276
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:42,240
有支军队在这里。
There is an army.

1277
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:48,240
我的朋友，我请求你冒险前往更伟大的表面。
I am asking you to risk yourself, my friend, on the surface of something greater.

1278
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:52,240
前往奥斯提亚。
Ride to Ostia.

1279
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:57,240
把这枚戒指送给达里乌斯·塞克斯将军，你听明白了吗？
Take this ring to General Darius Sextus, are you listening?

1280
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:59,240
达里乌斯·塞克斯？
Darius Sextus?

1281
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:02,240
你会认出它是阿卡修斯的戒指。
You will know it as Acacius' ring.

1282
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:06,240
我该说什么？
And what shall I say?

1283
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,240
只有这枚戒指。
It's only with this ring.

1284
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:16,240
我是卢修斯·维鲁斯·奥列里乌斯，罗马王子。
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius, the Prince of Rome.

1285
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:22,240
告诉他我正在召集军队保卫一个新共和国。
Tell him I am summoning the army to the defense of a new republic.

1286
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:32,240
我应该相信你吗？
Should I trust you?

1287
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:34,240
是的。
Yes.

1288
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,240
我应该吗？
Should I?

1289
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,240
是的。
Yes.

1290
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:47,240
拉维，我需要你的钥匙。

我的街道礼物已送达。

02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:31,240
如果她受制于此，她的死将激起暴徒。

但你必须先赢得它。

1339
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:18,240
今天，你将捍卫你的母亲。

1341
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:45,240
盗窃一分也是一分。

02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,240

1346
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:43,240
为了纪念皇帝卡拉卡拉的赞扬，第一议会诺尔默斯和第二议会马克里努斯，
In honour of the acclamation of Emperor Caracalla, First Council Nolmus and Second Council Macrinus,

1347
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:53,240
及因她密谋反对帝国，反对皇帝的皇家血统，而受到惩罚；
and as punishment for her conspiracy against the Empire, for her candies against the Emperor's Imperial bloodline,

1348
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:57,240
以及为了与她的支持者煽动军事叛变，

1349
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:04,240
女王将面对禁卫军的神圣审判。
the Queen will face divine justice at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.

1350
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,240
啊！
Aah!

1351
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:31,240
我不是一名将军。
I'm not a general.

1352
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,240
但我们都是士兵。
But we are all soldiers.

1353
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:44,240
直到现在，我们所做的只是为了生存而战。
And up until now, we have fought for nothing more than another day's survival.

1354
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,240
你要我们怎么做呢？
What will you have us do?

1355
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:51,240
如果你不想参加这场战斗，可以选择离开。
Well, you can return to yourselves if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1356
02:04:51,240 --> 02:05:00,240
或者你可以和我一起为超越这些墙壁的自由而奋斗。
Or you can join me and fight for a freedom far beyond these walls.

1357
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,240
是的，是的，是的，是的，是的。
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1358
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:06,240
曾经在罗马，荣誉意味着某种东西的时代。
There once was a time when honour meant something in Rome.

1359
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:12,240
在这个罗马，我不再相信那还存在。
In this Rome, I no longer believe that exists.

1360
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:14,240
我们必须找到它。
We must find it.

1361
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:23,240
要知道，死亡所在，我们不在其中。
And know that where death is, we are not.

1362
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:30,240
我们所在之处，死亡不在其中。
Where we are, death is not.

1363
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:33,240
我剑为何？
Why my sword?

1364
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:37,240

不可说皇帝不仁慈。
Let it not be said that the Emperor is not merciful.

女王将得到一名角鬥士来保护她免受禁卫军的伤害。
The Queen will be granted a single gladiator to defend her against the Praetorian Guard.
