01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:30,541
<b>In your current
state, I could best you now.</b>

537
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:35,583
<b>Luckily for you, I
have put down my sword, so I</b>

538
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:40,416
<b>will spend my days
saving lives instead of taking them.</b>

539
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,625
<b>My voice has changed so late in life.</b>

540
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:48,833
<b>What we do in life echoes in eternity.</b>

541
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,291
<b>I feel like I know who those were.</b>

542
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,625
<b>My captain credit is
written on one of the tombs.</b>

543
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,000
<b>With the bones of a gladiator.</b>

544
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:06,291
<b>My champion, I shall never rest.</b>

545
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:14,416
<b>My champion, did you hear that crowd?</b>

546
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:19,416
<b>Did you hear that crowd?</b>

547
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:22,708
<b>You have something.</b>

548
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:24,875
<b>I know it from the start.</b>

549
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:25,875
<b>The jalapenos.</b>

550
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:33,583
<b>Yes, the Greeks
call it thymos, smoke, rage.</b>

551
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:36,708
<b>And rage is your gift.</b>

552
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:42,291
<b>Like the great Achilles, never let it go.</b>

553
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:47,375
<b>It will carry you
to greatness, my champion.</b>

554
01:07:55,708 --> 01:08:11,125
<b>Thank you for inviting me.</b>

555
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:13,750
<b>This is truly an honor.</b>

556
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,833
<b>I hear you have talked the court.</b>

557
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,750
<b>Yes, we met before.</b>

558
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:27,750
<b>Have we?</b>

559
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:28,458
<b>Long ago.</b>

560
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:31,000
<b>Where?</b>

561
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,541
<b>I was in the service of your
father's army on this African campaign.</b>

562
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:38,875
<b>You served with my father.</b>

563
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:40,500
<b>Oh.</b>

564
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:49,583
<b>I had the privilege
of reading his meditations.</b>

565
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:59,666
<b>The best revenge is to be
unlike him who performed the injury.</b>

566
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,541
<b>I hear you've been arming
half the legions of the entire empire.</b>

567
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,000
<b>You've been here, now, in Rome.</b>

568
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:14,333
<b>You're gaining
influence by sponsoring gladiators.</b>

569
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,458
<b>I do it for the love of the sport.</b>

570
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:19,541
<b>And where did you find these gladiators?</b>

571
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:25,583
<b>They're usually
prisoners of war or vagrants.</b>

572
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:26,958
<b>What do you ask?</b>

573
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:33,791
<b>A man can choose to fight and stay alive.</b>

574
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,208
<b>It's the same in life as
it is in the arena, is it not?</b>

575
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:40,875
<b>Who is this?</b>

576
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,541
<b>That is my father as a youth.</b>

577
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:48,500
<b>She had a child.</b>

578
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,875
<b>It's common knowledge.</b>

579
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:54,333
<b>When commonness was
killed, the boy disappeared.</b>

580
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:55,833
<b>Boy would care.</b>

581
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,125
<b>Silla would care.</b>

582
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,041
<b>More wives!</b>

583
01:09:58,583 --> 01:09:59,125
<b>More wives!</b>

584
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:04,000
<b>He was of a royal bloodline, after all.</b>

585
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,083
<b>And his father?</b>

586
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,541
<b>Ostensibly, Lucius Verus.</b>

587
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,333
<b>You see, it was an arranged marriage.</b>

588
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,541
<b>She was 14.</b>

589
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:18,916
<b>Females were not his taste.</b>

590
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,333
<b>No mind, some days.</b>

591
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:22,750
<b>No, no, no.</b>

592
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,833
<b>By room, you see, she took lovers.</b>

593
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:31,125
<b>And by room, the
real father was commonness.</b>

594
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,166
<b>It's probably love, you see.</b>

595
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:37,666
<b>If he died, there has to be remains.</b>

596
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,000
<b>And if he lived,
that would make him about...</b>

597
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:44,666
<b>Well, let's work it out.</b>

598
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:47,708
<b>He was about 12 when he died.</b>

599
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,208
<b>Yes.</b>

600
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:51,000
<b>So that would make him...</b>

601
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:28,958
<b>Bye, lady.</b>

602
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:30,583
<b>practice.</b>

603
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:32,500
<b>I used to go.</b>

604
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:32,875
<b>Thank you.</b>

605
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:56,125
<b>Lady, do you know me?</b>

606
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:57,875
<b>[coughing]</b>

607
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:05,625
<b>You have a family.</b>

608
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:09,208
<b>A wife.</b>

609
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:11,375
<b>A Rishan.</b>

610
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,125
<b>A Rishan?</b>

611
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:17,166
<b>She was killed
under your husband's command.</b>

612
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,208
<b>From drowns in the turf blood.</b>

613
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,041
<b>And yet you enjoy the
pleasures of the cotton ceiling.</b>

614
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,375
<b>There's much you do not understand.</b>

615
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:37,125
<b>Duchess.</b>

616
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:40,000
<b>I do not know who you think I am.</b>

617
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:46,000
<b>My name is Harlow, and I have
no mother or mother I can remember.</b>

618
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:54,041
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

619
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:58,416
<b>If you were somewhere here, I feel
sure he would tell you not to grieve him.</b>

620
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,833
<b>For he would not be
the boy that you sent away.</b>

621
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:07,083
<b>That boy is dead. You
may think I have little worth.</b>

622
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:11,458
<b>You may think I betrayed you.</b>

623
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,583
<b>But I need you to know,</b>

624
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:18,666
<b>if you will not have your mother's love</b>

625
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,958
<b>and take your father's strength,</b>

626
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:24,500
<b>you need it.</b>

627
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:26,833
<b>His name was Maximus,</b>

628
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,666
<b>and Decimus moved
me. His name was Maximus,</b>

629
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:31,250
<b>and Decimus moved me.</b>

630
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,333
<b>And I see him in you.</b>

631
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:35,166
<b>Get out.</b>

632
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,916
<b>I say to you, we must go at once.</b>

633
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,250
<b>It's just you were loved.</b>

634
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:48,625
<b>By myself and by your father.</b>

635
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:52,541
<b>Your name was on his list.</b>

636
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:53,458
<b>Get out!</b>

637
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:19,458
<b>[MUSIC PLAYING]</b>

638
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:21,208
<b>There's just this alive.</b>

639
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:25,125
<b>Are you certain?</b>

640
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:26,833
<b>Yes.</b>

641
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,541
<b>I know my son.</b>

642
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,125
<b>I spoke to him tonight.</b>

643
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,875
<b>He may be lost to me for what I did.</b>

644
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:43,375
<b>But he lives.</b>

645
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,208
<b>The third day of the game is tomorrow.</b>

646
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,541
<b>Most fighters won't survive.</b>

647
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,625
<b>Okay, so you must help.</b>

648
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:55,791
<b>Help him. Yes.</b>

649
01:14:57,208 --> 01:15:01,041
<b>I failed him then.</b>

650
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,166
<b>I know I did.</b>

651
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,583
<b>I cannot fail him now.</b>

<b>Naomi's an austere.</b>

653
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,416
<b>If we wait a few days...</b>

654
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,250
<b>He could be dead by then.</b>

655
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,583
<b>My kisses.</b>

656
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:23,250
<b>I would willingly give my life from...</b>

657
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,791
<b>But I will not give my sons.</b>

01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:34,500
<b>One.</b>

<b>Two.</b>

<b>And one.</b>

<b>And one.</b>

<b>And two.</b>

<b>Go, go.</b>

<b>One can fall like this.</b>

<b>Just him.</b>

<b>Let's see how far you can

<b>Ready?</b>

01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:10,708
<b>One.</b>

674
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:13,625
<b>Two.</b>

675
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:14,291
<b>Got it.</b>

676
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,291
<b>Come on. More.</b>

<b>More.</b>

<b>Just vinegar, my friend.</b>

<b>There will be no more opium for you.</b>

683
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:14,416
<b>There is beauty of pain

<b>I don't know why you are

<b>Are you a free man, Robbie?</b>

686
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:23,750
<b>No. I'm not a free

<b>Free.</b>

688
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:28,041
<b>I am.</b>

689
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:33,583
<b>I lay down my sword and I
swore never to pick it up again.</b>

690

<b>Didn't you choose this now?</b>

691
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:35,750
<b>Yeah.</b>

692
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,166
<b>What was your home before?</b>

693
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,250
<b>But I'm not.</b>

694

<b>Why don't you go back?</b>

695
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:44,166
<b>Wish I could.</b>

696

<b>I'm not a woman.</b>

697
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,708
<b>It's always a woman, for once.</b>

698
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,875
<b>She's from Bloombdino, in Italy.</b>

699
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:02,791
<b>So now, our sons, they speak only Latin.</b>

700
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:06,125
<b>My daughter says, "Ah,
it's there, it's blue as yours."</b>

<b>We are robots now.</b>

702
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,833
<b>I grew up hearing
stories of my grandfather's knee.</b>

703
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:17,791
<b>He used to talk of
the dream that was wrong.</b>

704
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:25,416
<b>It was so fragile,

705
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,250
<b>What a vanish.</b>

706
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,375
<b>What a sister.</b>

707
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:37,083
<b>A wrong where all could
live on the foul lawn, be protected.</b>

708
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:39,625
<b>Wrong with the Senate.</b>

709
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,083
<b>A wrong of hope.</b>

710
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:51,541
<b>Your grandfather, he
