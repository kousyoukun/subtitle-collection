00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,852
...向你致敬。

2
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,864
温柔一点，汉诺。

3
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,284
我们呼唤你
以你们伟大的名字

4
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,119
来帮助我们。

5
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,871
击败罗马人。

6
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,539
摧毁他们的船只，

7
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,249
他们的战争引擎，

8
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,209
和他们的士兵。

9
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,338
我们会取得胜利。

10
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,136
奥扎尔斯切斯。

11
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,265
阿利沙特。

12
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,947
汉诺。

13
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,287
你没有做
今天的奉献。

14
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,790
我更喜欢牺牲一个罗马人。

15
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,015
你在哪里，

16
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,142
I am, too.

17
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,689
And where you are,

18
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,734
I am, too, forever.

19
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,319
My wife.

20
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,607
The wind is too strong.
Furl sail and strike water.

21
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,026
Furl sail,
strike water!

22
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,112
Furl sail
and strike water!

23
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,539
Strike water!

24
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,777
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

25
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,572
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction

26
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,365
and call it peace.

27
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,037
This is the last free city
in Africa Nova.

28
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,249
Today, we go into battle.

29
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,130
Pray that your god is with you.
If he is not, he is no god.

30
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,469
We've nothing to fear.

31
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,513
Where death is, we are not.

32
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,932
Where we are,

33
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
death is not.

34
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,939
Stay together and listen
for my commands.

35
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,403
Your eyes up
and your head out.

36
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,857
Fire!

37
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,032
Ready your weapons!

38
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,325
Again!

39
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,250
We're ablaze on the right!

40
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,336
Keep formation!

41
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,675
Pull!

42
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,600
Archers ready.

43
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,310
Release!

44
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,526
Nock!

45
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,945
画！

46
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,322
松动的！

47
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,538
弓箭手！

48
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,298
火！

49
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,812
- 升起塔！
- 升起塔！

50
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,164
- 向后退！
- 向后退！

51
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,173
继续转动。

52
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,851
吊桥掉下来！

53
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,520
吊桥卡住了！

54
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,614
先生！

55
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,284
松动的！

56
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,631
后退。

57
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,779
弓箭手！

58
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,988
那里！

59
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,448
杀了她！

60
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,617
阿利沙特！

61
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,647
阿利沙特。

62
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:32,121
阿利沙特！

63
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,213
I'll wait for you.

64
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,008
Check all the bodies!

65
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,010
Leave nothing!

66
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,579
I claim this city...

67
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,292
for the glory of Rome.

68
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,879
Vae victis.

69
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,383
Woe to the conquered.

70
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,487
Next!

71
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,365
Move it!

72
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,301
-Down the stairs!
-Downstairs!

73
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,434
Hey.

74
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,687
What damage have they
done you, eh?

75
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,535
Lift it up. Easy, easy.

76
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,912
Hold that.

77
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,211
Arishat?

78
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,924
I am sorry, my son.

79
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,096
I have not long.

80
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,433
This galley

81
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,894
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

82
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,105
I am ready... to be taken
to another place.

83
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,316
Stay here a while longer.

84
00:19:55,652 --> 00:20:00,324
I remember well when you
first were brought to us.

85
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,493
A lonely boy from the desert.
Guileless.

86
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,870
Afraid.

87
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,124
You embraced everything
we taught you.

88
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:15,505
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

89
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,968
When I die,

90
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,971
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

91
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,308
Who will meet you?

92
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,644
Hanno,

93
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,604
I am done.

94
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,066
Do not let them change
what you are.

95
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,807
Have you seen this boy?

96
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,439
Eama! Eama!

97
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,239
You must
go alone now, Hanno.

98
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,828
Never let them find you.

99
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,418
Go. Go.

100
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,659
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

101
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,077
Emperor Geta.

102
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,039
Emperor Caracalla.

103
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,167
General Acacius.

104
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,254
I have taken Numidia
in your names

105
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,172
that your dominion
may eclipse that

106
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,466
of every emperor
that came before you.

107
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,094
Crown him with laurels,
brother.

108
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,189
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

109
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,697
In honor
of your conquest,

110
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,783
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

111
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,495
I require no games
in my honor.

112
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,166
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

113
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,959
is honor enough for me.

114
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,837
You are too modest,
Acacius.

115
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,132
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

116
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,095
The glory is yours,
not mine.

117
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,307
I only ask for
从战争中得到一些喘息的机会

118
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,892
花时间
和我的妻子。

119
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,394
你的妻子，是的。

120
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,188
记住特权
我们已经准许她了吗？

121
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,816
她现在在哪里
忽视这样的场合？

122
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,694
有胜利
但尚未到来。

123
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,864
波斯。

124
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,116
印度。

125
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,996
两者……都必须被征服。

126
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,417
罗马有很多主题。

127
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,461
她必须喂饱他们。

128
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,964
他们可以吃战争。

129
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,970
你的胜利
将被庆祝

130
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,224
作为致敬
走向伟大

131
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,309
of the Roman people.

132
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,749
Go to hell!

133
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,272
Macrinus of Thysdrus,

134
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,566
master of gladiators!

135
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,965
Stay close.

136
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:52,193
Aediles
and the town councilors,

137
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,488
distinguished guests,

138
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,450
citizens of Antium,

139
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,539
behold the fate

140
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,501
of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

141
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:14,633
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

142
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,261
Jugurtha!

143
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,843
This one is interesting.

144
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,079
I'll buy him.

145
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,353
Halt! Who goes there?

146
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,148
General.

147
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,227
My lady.

148
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,737
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

149
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,990
Thank the Army.
They protected me.

150
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,910
Mm.

151
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,621
Let me feed you.

152
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,358
Go.

153
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,443
To the wall.

154
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,540
The arena
is a sacred temple.

155
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,250
For the bravest of you,

156
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,211
the road to glory
runs through the arena.

157
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,338
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

158
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,382
and gladiators into free men.

159
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,224
You have worms.

160
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,481
I know this one.
He eats monkeys.

161
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,040
Go. Sit. Eat.

162
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,726
You.

163
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,522
Hanno, get up.

164
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,573
What is your native language?
I speak them all.

165
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,372
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

166
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,667
Mm, all right.

167
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,546
Violence...
is the universal language.

168
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,298
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

169
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,344
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

170
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,332
Enough!

171
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,046
Very good.

172
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,924
Very good.

173
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,344
Hose him down.

174
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
Bring him to me.

175
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,857
Ah!

176
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,529
A strong jaw.

177
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,698
Good arms.

178
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,535
Better smell.

179
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,206
You will do well.

180
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,792
It is an art,

181
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
choosing gladiators.

182
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,422
Some choose entertainers.

183
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,591
Some choose brute force.

184
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
I choose rage.

185
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,141
Crowd loves blood.

186
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,017
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

187
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,603
而你，我的朋友，愤怒

188
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,565
从你身上倾泻而出，就像……

189
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,568
像牛奶一样...

190
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,487
来自妓女的乳头。

191
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
你会
相当战斗机。

192
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,825
不适合你。

193
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,994
你说得对，
你不为我而战。

194
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,454
我把你放进戒指里
你要么战斗，要么死亡。

195
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,706
选择权在你。

196
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,750
但谁的头
我可以给你吗

197
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,462
这能满足这种愤怒吗？

198
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,464
整个罗马军队的。

199
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,094
太多了。

200
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,804
毫米。

201
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,973
The general will do.

202
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,057
General?

203
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,436
-General Acacius?
-Mm.

204
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,232
Use your rage
in my service,

205
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:37,236
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

206
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,532
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

207
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,369
and you will die.

208
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,124
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

209
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,001
rather than
fight their wars.

210
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,128
I've made my choice.

211
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,049
I can live with it.

212
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,097
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

213
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,019
Leta?

214
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,689
You may go to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

215
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,406
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

216
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,283
on that beach at Numidia...

217
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,454
Lucilla.

218
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,044
No more.

219
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,465
I will not waste

220
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,177
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

221
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,933
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

222
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,937
When will your troops
arrive?

223
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,023
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

224
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,152
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

225
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,197
All of them.

226
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,828
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

227
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:13,708
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

228
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,840
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

229
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,698
Enjoy yourself,
everyone,

230
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,742
to excess!

231
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,786
Thank you. Thank you.

232
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,091
Oh!

233
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,845
Please, drink.

234
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,848
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

235
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,769
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

236
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,022
-I'm just here for the games.
-Ah, well,

237
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,732
you won't be disappointed.

238
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,027
罗马拥有所有比赛
像你这样的男人喜欢玩。

239
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,363
像我这样的男人，Thraex？
像我们这样的男人。

240
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,991
我知道罗马什么也没发生
除非你先尝过。

第241章
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,093
我来这里的目的是什么？

第242章
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,677
你很快就会知道。

243
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,393
我们听到的是什么
关于你感兴趣

244
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,230
参加竞选
去参议院，马克里努斯？

245
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,816
我？不，我是，呃…

246
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,402
我什至不知道如何
使用算盘。

第247章
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,278
但我确实明白

248
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,781
这是习惯
为您的客人

249
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,492
to make wagers
at these affairs?

250
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,869
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

251
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,914
A thousand gold denarii?

252
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,374
Two.

253
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,544
Two?

254
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,756
Denarii.

255
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,400
Stand back! Stand back!

256
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,445
My emperors.

257
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,615
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

258
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,076
For your entertainment,

259
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,037
the art of combat!

260
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,875
May I present

261
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,043
the barbarian versus,

262
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:07,298
from my own stable,
the mighty Vichek!

263
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,183
-This is your gladiator?
-It is.

264
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,147
Three rounds,
hand to hand.

265
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,857
Swords!

266
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,277
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

267
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,531
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

268
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,783
Fight now!

269
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,373
Brother,

270
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,210
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

271
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,152
Remarkable!

272
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,198
Remarkable!

273
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,410
Thraex, he looked expensive.

274
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,955
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

275
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,291
Remarkable.

276
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,380
From where do you hail?

277
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,387
Speak.

278
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,183
我说说话。

第279章
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,977
他来自殖民地，
陛下。

280
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,479
他的母语
他只明白这一点。

第281章
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,989
“地狱之门
昼夜开放。

第282章
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,579
下降过程平稳，
方法很简单。

第283章
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,667
但...

第284章
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,796
从地狱回来

第285章
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,715
并观看欢快的天空，

第286章
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:59,428
在这个任务中
和强大的劳动谎言。”

第287章
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,311
维吉尔，陛下。

288
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,355
诗！

第289章
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,402
-非常聪明，马克林努斯。
-谢谢。

290
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,989
我已经变得如此无聊
但你让我很惊讶。

第291章
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,117
To amuse you is my only wish.

292
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,078
We are amused,
we are amused.

293
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,414
We are amused.

294
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,960
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

295
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,296
perform in the arena.

296
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,383
As do I, Your Majesties.

297
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,218
Thank you.

298
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,719
Viggo?

299
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,514
Come with me.

300
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,118
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

301
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,914
The lines you recited.

302
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,583
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

303
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,670
-A good verse travels far.
-Mm.

304
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,714
Who taught you poetry?

305
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,966
A captured Roman officer.

306
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,344
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

307
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,346
to pass the time.

308
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,473
And what became
of this prisoner?

309
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,100
Oh, we ate him.

310
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,436
As barbarians do.

311
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,896
As barbarians do.

312
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,982
And where were you born?

313
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,359
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

314
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,695
to die for you in the arena?

315
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,579
Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

316
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,375
A gladiator

317
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,044
can buy his own freedom.

318
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,922
His liberty.

319
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,508
The Roman dream.

320
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,635
No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

321
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,221
but of a slave
to call his own.

322
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,557
Cicero.

323
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,144
Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

324
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,398
What did you have to do
for Roman money?

325
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,193
You promised me a head.

326
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,154
Earn your keep and you
can have anyone's head.

327
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,138
Father,

328
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,766
protect us and guide us.

329
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,031
Senators.

330
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,866
My lady.

331
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,417
我的女士，我希望我们是
在更好的时代相遇。

第332章
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,295
更好的时代将会到来。

第333章
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,882
我们为什么在这里？

第334章
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,926
为了夺回这座城市。

第335章
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,348
并恢复罗马
到她应该去的地方。

第336章
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,643
一次令人兴奋的冒险。

第337章
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,355
-什么时候？
- 比赛最后一天。

第338章
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,025
我的军队等待我的命令
在奥斯蒂亚。

第339章
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,903
五千士兵
忠于我...

340
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,699
将进入罗马
然后是罗马斗兽场，

第341章
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,701
他们将在哪里
逮捕皇帝

第342章
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,494
为了他们的罪行
反对参议院

第343章
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,913
and their people.

344
00:47:55,789 --> 00:48:00,794
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

345
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,630
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

346
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,385
Marcus Aurelius talked of
restoring power to the Senate,

347
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,806
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

348
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,810
The people
have not seen hope

349
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,270
for many years.

350
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:22,024
But with time...
and guidance...

351
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,070
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

352
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,281
He had my loyalty.

353
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,993
And so do you.

354
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,747
Senator Thraex?

355
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,877
Politics follows power,
my lady.

356
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,048
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

357
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,092
and the Senate
will support you.

358
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,386
Thank you.

359
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,904
Food! Food!

360
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,869
When I was told of this place,

361
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,205
they never mentioned
the stink.

362
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,291
That would be Hanno.

363
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,464
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

364
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,806
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

365
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,727
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

366
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,562
Left in the hills to die.

367
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,693
That wolf found them and she
suckled them on her milk.

368
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,238
由动物抚养长大。
这是他们的血液。

第369章
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,241
你怎么知道这个地方的？

370
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,411
我知道混乱
他们带来了。

第371章
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,373
这座城市感染着
它所触及的一切。

第372章
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,542
我从来没有梦想过
它会这么大。

第373章
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,377
不要上当。

第374章
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,546
这座城市已经病了。

第375章
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,008
食物！食物！

第376章
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,200
你！野蛮人渣！

第377章
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,125
帮我。
请帮我！

第378章
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,163
-啊！
-Thraex。

第379章
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,959
关于我们的赌注。

380
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,795
啊。野蛮人。

第381章
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,213
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

382
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,173
I was merely
going to suggest

383
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,217
that perhaps your luck
might change.

384
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,761
Shall we say
double or quits?

385
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,391
-Ah.
-Ah.

386
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,155
Get back!

387
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,963
Fresh meat.

388
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,885
Line up! Line up!

389
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,085
Play! Play!

390
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,603
Emperor Caracalla.

391
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,147
Emperor Geta.

392
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,858
Citizens of Rome!

393
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,863
These sacred games

394
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:23,200
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

395
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,369
over the barbarians of Numidia.

396
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,290
Go! Go!

397
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,588
And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

398
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,882
General Justus Acacius!

399
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,635
Long live Acacius!

400
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,178
And with him

401
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:47,974
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

402
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,355
-Lucilla!
-Mother of Rome!

403
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,649
Acacius.

404
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,359
General.

405
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,286
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

406
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,500
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

407
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,418
Speak to them.

408
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,004
Speak to us!

409
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,974
I am not an orator

410
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,684
or a politician.

411
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,603
I am a soldier.

412
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:41,278
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

413
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,822
And even once in this arena.

414
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,075
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

415
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,371
ask for that same bravery.

416
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,792
Because Rome needs it now.

417
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,674
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

418
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,052
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

419
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,109
From the South Gate,

420
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:26,323
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

421
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,795
From the stables

422
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,466
of Emperors Caracalla
and Geta themselves,

423
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,135
不败冠军：

第424章
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,889
破坏者格莱西奥！

第425章
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,438
抓住。

第426章
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,213
抓住。

第427章
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,132
凯撒万岁！

第428章
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:31,096
糖！糖！糖！

第429章
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,944
抱在一起，当它
收费，撞墙。

第430章
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:46,986
我为什么要这么做？

第431章
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,117
抓住！

第432章
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,327
抓住！

第433章
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,370
休息！

第434章
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,747
胆小鬼！

第435章
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,888
到墙边去！

第436章
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,818
快点！

第437章
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,132
兄弟，就是那个诗人，
不是吗？

第438章
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,843
我不记得了。

第439章
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,720
那个夜晚很模糊。

第440章
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,683
“地狱之门
昼夜开放。

第441章
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,852
平滑描述——”
我忘记了。

第442章
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,771
“平稳下降……”

第443章
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,649
“下降是平稳的，

第444章
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,901
方法很简单。”

第445章
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,618
盾！

第446章
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,325
怜悯！怜悯！怜悯！

第447章
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,369
血。

第448章
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,540
露西拉，

第449章
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,459
我们要怜悯吗？

450
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,252
怜悯。

第451章
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,519
没有怜悯！

第452章
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,480
你的生活已经
众神幸免——

第453章
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:54,692
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

454
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:14,128
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,465
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,940
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

457
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,721
The road to freedom doesn't
run through the arena.

458
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,056
It leads to this.

459
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,479
Go to your cells.

460
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,903
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

461
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,172
Come on, let's go.

462
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,646
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

463
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,232
Smooth is the descent...

464
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,318
...easy is the way."

465
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,741
There, there, there, there.

466
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,159
And I've got you.

467
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,953
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

468
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,558
Scatto and Argento.

469
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,657
Lucius is safe?

470
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,551
Lucius!

471
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,065
Lucius,

472
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:24,193
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

473
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,196
There are men
who want to kill you

474
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,823
so they can take power.

475
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,661
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

476
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:37,373
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

477
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,917
I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

478
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,003
And for the sake of Rome.

479
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,589
记住你是谁。

第480章
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,632
我爱你。

第481章
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,718
我爱你。

第482章
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,678
来。

第483章
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,308
把你的腿给我。

第484章
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,811
去。去！

第485章
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,069
所以...

第486章
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,824
你叫什么名字？

第487章
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,204
我是拉维。我是一名医生。

第488章
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,876
因为……更多的人死去
受感染的伤口

第489章
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,587
比在外面、在竞技场上。

第490章
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,758
这个需要清洗一下
它需要缝合并且

第491章
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,552
它会很痛。

第492章
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,803
毫米。

第493章
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,015
这是恶魔之息
和鸦片。

第494章
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,184
是为了止痛吧

第495章
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,853
你应该吸气。

第496章
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,277
我来过这里
这么久了，

第497章
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,821
我什至不再注意到了。

第498章
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,741
我做过更多次截肢手术
我数不过来。

第499章
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,453
-你在哪里学的手艺？
-你为什么这么问？

500
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,288
你的手很重。

501
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,083
我曾经是
我自己也是一名角斗士。

502
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,542
啊。

503
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,753
你会打败我吗？

504
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,421
当然，在你的巅峰时期。

505
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,217
以你现在的状态，
I could best you now.

506
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,222
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

507
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,516
So now I spend my days

508
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,185
saving lives
instead of taking them.

509
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,272
And why such a change
so late in life?

510
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,275
What we do in life

511
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,820
echoes in eternity.

512
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,117
I feel like
I know those words.

513
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,744
I can't take credit.

514
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,414
It's written on
one of the tombs.

515
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,166
Over the bones of a gladiator.

516
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,584
My champion!

517
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,878
I smell Devil's Breath!

518
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,759
My... champion.

519
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,470
Did you hear that crowd?

520
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,684
-Did you hear that crowd?
-Mm-hm.

521
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,730
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

522
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,775
-Did you now?
-Yes. The Greeks call it...

523
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,028
thymos.

524
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,529
Smoke.

525
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,614
Rage.

526
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,659
That rage is your gift.

527
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,079
Like the great Achilles.

528
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,498
Never let it go.

529
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,460
It will carry you
to greatness,

530
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,420
my champion.

531
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,858
Thank you

532
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,902
for inviting me.

533
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,071
这确实是一种荣幸。

第534章
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,994
我听说你是
法庭的谈话。

第535章
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,414
是的。

第536章
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,750
我们以前见过面。

第537章
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,503
-我们有吗？
-很久以前。

第538章
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,464
在哪里？

第539章
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,466
我当时在服役
你父亲的军队

540
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,676
关于他的非洲竞选活动。

第541章
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,930
你服务过
和我父亲？

第542章
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,768
毫米。

第543章
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,479
我有幸

第544章
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,023
阅读的
他的《沉思》。

第545章
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,441
毫米。

第546章
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,363
“最好的报复

第547章
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:41,742
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

548
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,497
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

549
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:51,710
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

550
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,881
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

551
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,050
I do it for the love
of the sport.

552
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,220
And where did you find
these gladiators?

553
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,974
They're usually
prisoners of war.

554
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,311
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

555
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,231
A man can choose to fight...

556
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,693
and stay alive.

557
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,988
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

558
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,033
Who is this?

559
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,578
That is my father
as a youth.

560
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,957
She had a child?

561
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,792
Mm.

562
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,295
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

563
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,172
-the boy disappeared.
-Mm.

564
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,340
-But who would care?
-Lucilla would care.

565
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,177
-More wine!
-More wine!

566
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,015
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

567
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,976
And his father?

568
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:53,814
Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

569
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,691
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

570
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:56,859
She was 14.

571
01:09:56,942 --> 01:10:00,321
-Mm.
-Females were not his taste.

572
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,780
-Nor mine, some days.
-Nor yours!

573
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:07,661
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

574
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:11,999
And by rumor, the real father...
was Commodus.

575
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,336
-Brotherly love, you see?
-Yeah.

576
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,171
If he died,

577
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,549
-there has to be remains.
-Mm.

578
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,969
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

579
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,138
Um, well,
let's work it out.

580
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,642
-He was about 12 when he died?
-Yes.

581
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:34,104
So that would make him...

582
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,599
My lady.

583
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,101
Gracchus.

584
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,104
-Please come.
-Thank you.

585
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,291
Gladiator...

586
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,793
do you know me?

587
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,553
Do you have a family?

588
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,309
A wife. Arishat.

589
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,186
Arishat.

590
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,606
She was killed
under your husband's command.

591
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,403
Rome drowns
in its own blood.

592
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,905
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

593
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,076
There is much
you do not understand.

594
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,917
Lucius.

595
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,086
I do not know
who you think I am.

596
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,299
My name is Hanno,

597
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,926
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

598
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,560
I'm so sorry.

599
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:38,771
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

600
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,773
not to grieve him.

601
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,608
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

602
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,777
That boy is dead.

603
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,281
You may think
I have little worth.

604
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,951
You may think
I betrayed you.

605
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,705
But I need you to know...

606
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,001
if you will not have
your mother's love,

607
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,046
then take
your father's strength.

608
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,632
You need it.

609
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:13,138
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

610
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,933
And I see him in you.

611
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,476
Get out.

612
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,064
My lady, we must go at once!

613
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,861
Lucius, you were loved

614
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,115
by myself
and by your father.

615
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,784
Your name
was on his lips--

616
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,744
Get out!

617
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,689
Lucius is alive.

618
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,776
Are you certain?

619
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,236
Yes.

620
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,530
I know my son.

621
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,452
I spoke to him
tonight.

622
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,916
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

623
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,836
but he lives.

624
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,590
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

625
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,258
Most fighters won't survive.

626
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,801
Acacius,

627
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,679
you must help him.

628
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,390
-Help him?
-Yes.

629
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,395
I failed him then.

630
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,481
I know I did.

631
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,401
I cannot fail him now.

632
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,405
The army is in Ostia.

633
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,283
If we wait a few days...

634
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,494
He could be dead
by then.

635
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,788
Acacius,

636
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:05,584
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

637
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,171
but I will not
give my son's.

638
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,638
And one.

639
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,182
And two.

640
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,976
还有一个。

第641章
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,021
一起。
时机，时机，时机！

第642章
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,359
还有一个。还有两个。

第643章
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,903
还有一个。

第644章
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,988
暂停，暂停！

第645章
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,034
我们不会走远
像这样。

第646章
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,121
只有他。你去。

第647章
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,915
去！

第648章
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:48,585
让我们看看你能走多远
没有你的团队，就靠你自己。

第649章
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,713
准备好？

650
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,131
一！

第651章
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:54,883
还有两个！

第652章
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,135
时机，时机！

第653章
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,221
来吧，更多！

第654章
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,061
更多的！

第655章
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,079
离开他。

第656章
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,476
这只是
醋，我的朋友。

第657章
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,981
将有
不再给你鸦片了。

第658章
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:55,902
还有很多痛苦在等待
为了下辈子的你。

第659章
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:59,448
我不知道你为什么这样
贪婪于此。

660
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,537
你是自由人吗，拉维？

第661章
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,539
“自由的。”

第662章
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,585
我是。毫米。

第663章
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,211
我放下了剑

第664章
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,297
我发誓永远不会
再次拿起它。

第665章
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,965
然而
你选择这个地狱吗？

第666章
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,675
嗯嗯。

第667章
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,177
你以前的家是什么？

第668章
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,763
瓦拉纳西。

第669章
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,140
那你为什么不回去呢？

670
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,683
我希望我能。

第671章
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,560
但...

第672章
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,148
-我遇到了一个女人。
-啊。

第673章
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,360
-永远都是女人。
-总是。

第674章
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:40,405
她来自伦敦。
不列颠尼亚。你知道。

第675章
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,324
所以现在...

第676章
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,369
我们的儿子们，
他们只说拉丁语。

第677章
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,871
女儿的眼睛，
它们和你的一样蓝色。

第678章
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,167
我们现在是罗马人了。

第679章
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,004
我是听故事长大的
在我祖父的膝盖上。

680
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,509
他曾经说话
罗马的梦想。

第681章
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,765
原来是那么脆弱，
你只能低声说……

第682章
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,852
否则它就会消失。

第683章
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,146
所以，

第684章
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,898
这个梦是什么？

第685章
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:19,611
所有人都可以居住的罗马
并受到公平法律的保护。

第686章
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,447
元老院的罗马。

第687章
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,617
充满希望的罗马。

第688章
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,999
你的祖父，
他听起来像个危险的人。

第689章
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,376
嗯。

690
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,256
情况对你不利。

第691章
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,635
赔率
总是反对我。

第692章
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:45,721
别担心，老头子。

第693章
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,639
呃？

第694章
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,353
-你应该休息一下。嗯？
-毫米。

695
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:56,898
你的男人会需要你
领导他们明天。

696
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,958
这是关于生存的。

第697章
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,335
存活！

698
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:21,214
以波塞冬之名，

699
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:25,469
我们庆祝荣耀
海战的。

700
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,304
他们有弓箭手。

701
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,848
做好准备。
听我的命令。

第702章
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,684
呆在一起
并拉为一体，是吗？

703
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,643
是的！

704
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,146
-是的？
-是的！

705
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,655
今天我们重温一下

706
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:49,284
萨拉米斯海战！

707
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:55,207
特洛伊木马
对抗波斯人！

708
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,338
-划桨！
-桨！

709
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,132
And... pull!

710
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,779
Archers!

711
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:26,863
Archers!

712
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,033
Pull!

713
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,585
Pull!

714
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,422
Pull!

715
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:00,063
Pull! To my time!

716
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,107
And... now!

717
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,028
Left side! Ready, and

718
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,072
ship oars now!

719
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,324
Oars in! Oars in!

720
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:13,702
Get down!

721
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,763
And pull! And pull!

722
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:38,727
Don't stop!

723
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,230
Pull!

724
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,318
And right!

725
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,325
Ready to ram!

726
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:58,079
And brace! Brace!

727
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,579
Everyone regroup!

728
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:17,867
Praetorians!

729
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,621
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

730
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:22,664
Move, move.

731
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,757
In the name of the emperors...

732
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:37,512
the victor is Hanno!

733
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,109
Who did this?

734
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,072
Who did this?!

735
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,867
-It was me!
-I did it!

736
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,910
-I did it! I did it! I did it!
-It was me!

737
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,584
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

738
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:09,794
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

739
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,379
you learned to recite poetry?

740
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,630
Be glad it wasn't me,

741
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,090
or that arrow
would have found you.

742
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,441
Be seated.

743
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,361
I have news for you.

744
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,326
He's here, sir.

745
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,456
Oh, still here.

746
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,959
Macrinus.

747
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,253
Welcome.

748
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,049
Yes, I'm listening.

749
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:58,718
You know
this is my house now.

750
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:01,137
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

751
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,597
You know that.

752
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,308
I have other things. Uh...

753
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,185
Cattle. Art!

754
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,895
Truth, then.

755
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,563
What do you... want?

756
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,316
Truth.
That's what I want.

757
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:17,946
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

758
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:21,116
You have
the senators' trust.

759
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,077
You have
Lucilla's trust.

760
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,955
More importantly,
you have my trust.

761
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:32,877
You wish my... loyalty?

762
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,712
I own...

763
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,924
your house.

764
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,718
I want your loyalty.

765
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,890
I...

766
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,810
-Tell me.
-I have heard...

767
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:51,646
of a plot...

768
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:55,150
-to dethrone the emperors.
-Yes.

769
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,694
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

770
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:00,947
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

771
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,448
-Tonight.
-Mm.

772
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,743
-I don't know why.
-I know why. I know who.

773
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:09,205
Pack.

774
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,377
Quickly.

775
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:43,364
Open up!

776
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,470
Open for
the emperors' guard!

777
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:36,501
My Lady, come with us.

778
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:24,007
Thanks to the civic virtue

779
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,801
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

780
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,804
your insurrection

781
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,473
has been revealed.

782
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,685
The honor,

783
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:40,648
罗马的尊严
已赐予你...

第784章
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,112
这一切都被你放弃了
因你的背叛。

第785章
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,239
拜托了，木塔天皇。

第786章
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,783
如果你愿意的话就折磨我吧

第787章
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:52,994
但别教训我。

第788章
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:56,622
你的名字
将会被遗忘！

第789章
01:28:57,623 --> 01:29:00,752
迷失在历史之中。

第790章
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,047
你该死，
一般的。

第791章
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,801
-你笑了。
-你该死的我？

第792章
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,554
我不在乎。

第793章
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:15,183
一切都会随着时间被遗忘。
帝国衰落。皇帝也是如此。

第794章
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,976
为什么要等？

第795章
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,271
-我现在就把他开膛破肚！
-不，不，不！

第796章
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,649
随他们去吧。来！来！

第797章
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,568
他的死必须公开。

798
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,153
民众？

799
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:30,114
把他的内脏挂起来
从城门出来！

800
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,866
并将她钉死在十字架上！

801
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,993
把她钉在十字架上！

802
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,995
把他们带走！

803
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,540
嘘！嘘！嘘！

804
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:53,846
谢谢你，马克里努斯。

805
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,521
快点。

806
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:06,734
在这最后的日子里，

807
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:10,071
我开始想你了
不作为主题

808
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,365
但作为一个真正的朋友。

809
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,117
谢谢。

810
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,869
太感谢了。
但作为朋友，

811
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,705
我必须建议谨慎行事。

812
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:22,875
阿卡修斯是罗马的英雄。

813
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:27,130
受难
是给盗贼用的。

第814章
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,423
基督徒。

815
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:32,468
-这太常见了。
-他是个叛徒。他必须死。

816
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,928
我同意。

第817章
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:39,851
让大神们来决定吧
他在斗兽场的命运。

818
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,859
就让大神们来决定吧。

819
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:54,699
你知道吗，昨晚我醒来，
梦见一条黑暗的河流。

820
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,119
这次，
首次，

第821章
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,787
我正在穿越它。

第822章
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:02,165
嗯。

第823章
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,750
嗯，你知道，
我来自哪里，

第824章
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:07,837
过河，
它代表着宽恕。

第825章
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,923
代表……救赎。

第826章
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:14,093
我来自哪里，
这意味着你已经死了。

第827章
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:24,979
但正如我所看到的，
我并不害怕。

828
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,274
为了...

829
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:31,319
因为有人在等待
对于另一边的我来说。

第830章
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,697
那里。

第831章
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,501
这个人是谁？

第832章
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,295
被刮掉了？

第833章
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,256
马克西姆斯.

第834章
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,011
我见过他打架一次。

第835章
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,555
-他很伟大。
-毫米。

第836章
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,600
是的。我在赛场上的时光，
it was after his,

837
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:06,979
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

838
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,357
Spoke of him.

839
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,776
What he did.

840
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,861
I met him once.

841
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:17,198
He was kind.

842
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:21,369
He bowed to no one.

843
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,415
Come with me.

844
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:29,627
-Hmm?
-Come. With me.

845
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:52,817
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

846
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,405
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

847
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,882
This is Argento.

848
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,593
This is Scatto.

849
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,635
Cheers.

850
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,720
And stop.

851
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:08,351
为了他的叛国罪
反对生命

第852章
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:12,521
皇帝的
和罗马国家，

第853章
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,067
贾斯图斯·阿卡修斯将军，

第854章
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,363
人民的敌人！

第855章
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,948
金合欢！金合欢！金合欢！

第856章
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,493
-我们爱你，阿卡修斯！
-你是英雄！

第857章
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:29,789
金合欢！金合欢！金合欢！

第858章
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,906
-Vae victis。
-一般的。

第859章
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,972
金合欢！

860
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:33,310
金合欢！金合欢！金合欢！

第861章
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:43,404
从
被征服的努米底亚城，

第862章
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:49,744
两次征服的胜利者
在斗兽场...

第863章
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:52,455
现在就去吧。 Vae 受害者。

第864章
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:59,545
汉诺！汉诺！汉诺！

865
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:01,964
Hanno!

866
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:04,842
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

867
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,635
-I will give it to you!
-It's too late.

868
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,014
The Roman traitor or

869
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:12,475
the barbarian hero.

870
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:14,935
Let the gods decide.

871
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,812
Lucius... wait.

872
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,440
Wait! Wait!

873
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:32,244
I am a vessel.

874
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,831
Fill me with vengeance

875
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,043
and vanquish the betrayer.

876
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:59,146
-We love you, Acacius!
-Move it!

877
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,819
Pick it up!

878
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:07,279
Bravo, Hanno!

879
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:08,823
我们爱你，阿卡修斯！

880
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:09,907
你还在等什么？

第881章
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,033
你会死的！

第882章
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:43,399
我知道你是谁。

第883章
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,236
卢修斯·维鲁斯·奥勒留。

第884章
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:02,543
金合欢属
已经举手了！

第885章
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,796
他已经投降了。

第886章
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:15,431
就让大神们来决定吧。

第887章
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,868
诸神已经渲染了
他们的判断。

第888章
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,497
做你必须做的事。

第889章
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:44,001
但在我死后，
你必须知道...

890
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,796
我爱你的妈妈，
露西拉.

第891章
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,633
还有你的父亲...

第892章
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,428
马克西姆斯.

第893章
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:57,806
我会死的
为了他。

第894章
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,767
杀了他！

895
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,645
让他活下去吧！
请！

896
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,815
居住！居住！居住！居住！

第897章
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:15,491
杀了他！

898
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,327
杀了他！

899
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,662
弓箭手！

900
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,580
-不！
-杀了他！

901
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:24,208
金合欢！金合欢！

902
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,001
杀了他！

903
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:27,503
杀了他！

904
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:29,046
杀了他！杀了他！

905
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:32,633
金合欢！

906
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:43,769
不！

907
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,813
不！

908
01:39:45,896 --> 01:39:47,606
金合欢！

909
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,069
该死的你！

910
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,948
死亡将是
对你太好了！

911
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,665
罗马就是这样吗
对待英雄？

912
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:10,170
告诉我！

913
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:16,760
如果他的生命没有价值，
你的值多少钱？

914
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:21,890
大神们都发话了！

915
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,575
汉诺！汉诺！汉诺！汉诺！

916
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:58,052
为了我们自己的安全，
我们该回王宫了。

917
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,605
汉诺！汉诺！汉诺！

918
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,700
退后！退后！

919
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:14,336
阿利沙特！

920
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,438
我们讨价还价。

921
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:40,279
我把他给了你。
你让他活着。

922
01:42:40,362 --> 01:42:42,030
你得到了
你想要什么。

923
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,741
我总能得到我想要的。
你为什么让他活着？

924
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:47,786
你买了一个角斗士，
不是奴隶。

925
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,290
我的意志是我自己的。

926
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,835
啊...

927
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:57,588
你的血有多蓝？

928
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,257
也许是罗马人的心

929
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,676
在那胸膛里跳动。

930
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:11,143
最伟大的寺庙
罗马曾经建成。

931
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:12,769
罗马斗兽场。

第932章
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,189
因为这是
他们相信什么。

第933章
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:16,899
力量。

第934章
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:19,693
他们聚集在这里观看
强者击倒弱者。

935
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:21,612
-一定还有别的东西。
-没有别的事了。

第936章
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,615
-必须有另一个罗马。
-没有第二个罗马。

第937章
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,618
-“梦想”？
-毫米。

938
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,620
罗马的梦想？

939
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,330
这是一个老人的幻想。

940
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,499
你是谁？

第941章
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:40,589
在你之前你叫什么名字
把它换成罗马的？

第942章
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:43,091
你永远不会知道。

第943章
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,512
我有一个命运。

第944章
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:53,352
众神把你交给了我。

第945章
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:57,981
你将成为我的乐器。

第946章
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,485
我永远不会成为你的工具
今生或来世。

第947章
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,955
那不会是我的命运。

948
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:16,541
But I will see your end.

949
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:39,439
What else could I do?

950
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,316
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

951
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:44,069
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

952
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:46,196
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

953
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,031
-Like they have every other.
-You brought this on us.

954
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,659
Filthy ape!

955
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,957
Perhaps you should, uh,

956
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,503
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

957
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:13,348
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

958
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,685
The disease
that infects his loins

959
01:45:16,768 --> 01:45:18,729
has spread to his brain.

960
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:21,940
-Every day he gets worse.
-I will reason with him.

961
01:45:38,206 --> 01:45:41,335
I see you.

962
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,545
I see you.

963
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:47,049
Caracalla, Caracalla!

964
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,759
Come on, stand up.

965
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,927
Get up, get up.
Not you.

966
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,888
All right,
there you go.

967
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:56,850
Now, listen to me.

968
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,518
What's the matter?

969
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:01,271
Nothing's ever mine.

970
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,690
Everything is ours,
always.

971
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:07,069
Even in the womb...
he tried...

972
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:11,156
to cut my umbilicus

973
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:13,075
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

974
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,452
-You remember that, do you?
-Certainly.

975
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,871
-Come, sit.
-One cannot forget.

976
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:20,207
My conscience compels me.

977
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:21,750
What?

978
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,043
Sit.

979
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:24,586
Your brother

980
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:26,963
means to blame you

981
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,300
in front of
the entire Senate...

982
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,760
But I did not do it!

983
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:33,428
...for what's happening
in the streets.

984
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:35,889
-The chaos!
-He's lying!

985
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:37,808
No testimony
can be more damning

986
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:41,353
than one brother
against another.

987
01:46:41,436 --> 01:46:44,106
That's a lie!
He always lies!

988
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:46,650
He can be very persuasive.

989
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:49,444
So?
What will they do to me?

990
01:46:49,528 --> 01:46:52,322
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

991
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:54,533
What will they do to Dondus?

992
01:46:57,577 --> 01:47:00,414
What will they do

993
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:01,873
to Dondus?

994
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,627
It's your decision.

995
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:44,332
Brother.

996
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,671
Put down the blade.

997
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:50,881
You lie.

998
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,757
-Give it to me.
-You always lie!

999
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:53,800
Give it--

1000
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,973
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1001
01:48:00,056 --> 01:48:02,476
-Lie!
-Listen to me. Break the spell.

1002
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:04,561
-说谎！
-打破咒语！

1003
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,898
我一直都在保护你。
因为我爱你。

1004
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,609
回来。帮我。

1005
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,633
卢修斯。

1006
01:48:56,279 --> 01:48:58,907
从来没有想象过
命运会把我们带到这里。

1007
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:02,911
但我们现在就在这里。

1008
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:06,248
一切都有
让我们回到了原点。

1009
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:09,417
你送我走
然而命运

1010
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:12,087
带我回到
他死的地方。

1011
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:16,091
这枚戒指...

1012
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:19,678
属于我父亲。

1013
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,726
他把它给了你
父亲马克西姆斯，

1014
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,770
作为信任的象征。

1015
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,149
我把它给了阿卡修斯
为了他的英勇。

1016
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:39,864
这枚戒指是我妻子的。

1017
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,327
我会把它穿在你的旁边。

1018
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:01,052
我真的为阿卡修斯感到抱歉。

1019
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:05,056
我看不到那个人。

1020
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:09,227
他是罗马的一名士兵。

1021
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:12,564
有一个计划。

1022
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,150
他正在准备军队
在奥斯蒂亚

1023
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:18,278
指挥下
大流士塞克斯图斯。

1024
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:21,489
他所率领的部队
反对皇帝。

1025
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:27,912
金合欢属。马克西姆斯.
马库斯·奥勒留。

1026
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:31,416
They lived and died
for Rome.

1027
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,585
We all do.

1028
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:38,006
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

1029
01:50:40,884 --> 01:50:42,927
One man or another has had
a sword against my neck

1030
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:45,430
since the day
my father died.

1031
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:50,644
But now
that I've found you,

1032
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:53,271
it doesn't matter.

1033
01:50:54,564 --> 01:50:56,316
I am not afraid.

1034
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:59,569
I've become well versed in
losing the things that I love.

1035
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:03,573
But now that I've found you,

1036
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,450
I have no desire
to lose you again.

1037
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:10,830
-You stand like him.
-Mm.

1038
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:12,957
Alert.

1039
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,959
自豪的。

1040
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:19,756
我没有他的实力。

1041
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,801
我希望这是真的。

1042
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:27,263
我希望我能告诉你
逃离这个地方。

1043
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:37,232
现在就去吧。

1044
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:46,700
实力与荣誉。

1045
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,870
实力与荣誉。

1046
01:52:03,425 --> 01:52:05,552
作为皇帝，

1047
01:52:05,635 --> 01:52:07,345
我已召集

1048
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:11,474
参议院任命
我的第一任领事

1049
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:14,894
并赋予他权力
管理军队

1050
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:18,314
和公民职能
帝国的。

1051
01:52:22,068 --> 01:52:23,528
我命名...

1052
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:27,031
公民唐杜斯！

1053
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,749
唐杜斯万岁！

1054
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:40,670
唐杜斯万岁！

1055
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:45,300
- 唐杜斯万岁。
- 唐达斯万岁！

1056
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:47,969
唐杜斯万岁！

1057
01:52:52,098 --> 01:52:54,058
作为第二领事...

1058
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:57,479
我命名...

1059
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:01,149
公民...

1060
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:04,861
马克里努斯！

1061
01:53:07,155 --> 01:53:08,865
马克里努斯万岁！

1062
01:53:08,948 --> 01:53:10,450
马克里努斯万岁！

1063
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:12,535
马克里努斯万岁！

1064
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:16,873
将会有一场胜利
游行庆祝。

1065
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,583
会有游戏

1066
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,252
和大规模处决。

1067
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:27,175
帝国万岁！

1068
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,428
帝国万岁！

1069
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:32,263
帝国万岁！

1070
01:53:38,561 --> 01:53:39,854
坐下。

1071
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:45,944
我碰巧有...

1072
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:53,201
有好运
而且还没有一点技巧...

1073
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,081
剩下的皇帝的耳朵。

1074
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:07,549
我可以用逻辑来解释它...

1075
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,806
并驯服疯狂
在街上。但...

1076
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:19,394
恢复秩序...

1077
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:23,314
我必须有权力...

1078
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,070
和命令

1079
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,739
凌驾于禁卫军之上。

1080
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:39,372
选票...

1081
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:42,917
或手？

1082
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:47,589
-是啊！
-是啊！

1083
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,510
鄙人。

1084
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,182
Put your hands down.

1085
01:55:00,768 --> 01:55:02,353
You can sit down.

1086
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:17,535
Rome must fall.

1087
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,290
I need only
give it a push.

1088
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:27,545
And after Rome falls...

1089
01:55:28,379 --> 01:55:30,882
...what then?

1090
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:35,053
You are
your father's child.

1091
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,433
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

1092
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:42,560
It was a fiction.

1093
01:55:42,644 --> 01:55:44,938
"The best revenge is

1094
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:48,900
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1095
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:53,988
I have made myself
unlike your father.

1096
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:57,617
He spoke of dreams,
我说的是实话。

1097
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:00,244
以及唯一的真相
在我的罗马

1098
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:03,831
是法律
最强的。

1099
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,502
我被拥有

1100
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:10,505
由一位皇帝。

1101
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:15,593
现在我控制着一个帝国。

1102
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:19,931
除了罗马之外还有什么地方
一个人能做到吗？

1103
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:29,732
你认识吗
我身上有你父亲的印记吗？

1104
01:56:34,445 --> 01:56:35,863
如果有什么的话

1105
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:37,949
你需要...

1106
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,369
在这最后的几个小时里，

1107
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:44,038
我们将提供。

1108
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:52,463
你的死将为我扫清道路
登上王位。

1109
01:56:54,257 --> 01:56:57,260
明天
会有比赛。

1110
01:56:57,343 --> 01:56:59,053
而对他们...

1111
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,639
我会获胜。

1112
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:16,779
拉维！

1113
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:25,538
你能给我留言吗
早上到奥斯蒂亚？

1114
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:27,373
奥斯蒂亚有什么？

1115
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,000
有一支军队。

1116
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:32,837
我问你
冒着风险，我的朋友，

1117
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,173
在服务中
更伟大的事物。

1118
01:57:37,967 --> 01:57:39,469
乘车前往奥斯蒂亚。

1119
01:57:40,636 --> 01:57:42,764
拿着这个戒指
达流斯·塞克斯图斯将军。

1120
01:57:42,847 --> 01:57:44,348
你在听吗？

1121
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:47,560
大流士塞克斯图斯。

1122
01:57:47,643 --> 01:57:49,771
他会知道的
作为阿卡修斯的戒指。

1123
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:54,859
And, uh,

1124
01:57:55,651 --> 01:57:57,111
who shall I say has

1125
01:57:57,695 --> 01:57:59,489
sent me with this ring?

1126
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:05,203
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1127
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:07,955
The Prince of Rome.

1128
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:10,583
Tell him
I am summoning the army

1129
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:13,044
to the defense
of a new Republic.

1130
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:22,845
-Should I trust you?
-Yes.

1131
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:25,098
-Should I?
-Yes.

1132
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:34,690
Ravi! I need your keys.

1133
01:58:40,696 --> 01:58:42,490
Thank you.

1134
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:22,780
Stop! Come back!

1135
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:54,687
Who gave you this?

1136
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,815
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1137
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:00,276
罗马王子。

1138
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:56,499
我们必须杀掉露西拉吗？

第1139章
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,879
直到她去世为止，
你永远不会知道和平。

1140
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:04,799
曾经。

1141
02:01:15,559 --> 02:01:18,187
人们爱她。
她的死会煽动暴徒。

第1142章
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,856
如果她死了，街上
愤怒地起来，

1143
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,441
我将交付他们
卡拉卡拉的头

1144
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:23,943
和人民
会为我喝彩。

1145
02:01:24,026 --> 02:01:27,738
那，我的朋友，
是政治。

1146
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:32,410
-我们可以？
-是的。

第1147章
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,760
今天将是
你的最后一场战斗，冠军。

1148
02:01:50,761 --> 02:01:52,513
还有我们的主人
已赐予你...

1149
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,268
the wooden sword of freedom.

1150
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:03,190
But you have to
earn it first.

1151
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:05,735
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

1152
02:02:28,549 --> 02:02:31,510
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

1153
02:02:58,662 --> 02:03:00,289
Wait for me.

1154
02:03:19,016 --> 02:03:20,768
In honor

1155
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:25,189
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

1156
02:03:25,272 --> 02:03:31,237
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1157
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:35,866
and as punishment for her
conspiracy against the empire,

1158
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:40,454
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1159
02:03:40,538 --> 02:03:42,790
and for fomenting
military mutiny

1160
02:03:42,873 --> 02:03:44,375
和她的丈夫一起，

1161
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:48,129
女王将面临
神圣的正义

第1162章
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:52,425
在手上
禁卫军的成员。

1163
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:18,409
我不是将军。

1164
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:23,622
但我们都是军人。

1165
02:04:25,499 --> 02:04:27,293
并且到现在为止，

1166
02:04:27,376 --> 02:04:31,672
我们不再为之奋斗
比另一天的生存还要重要。

第1167章
02:04:31,755 --> 02:04:33,716
你会怎样
我们有吗？

1168
02:04:34,925 --> 02:04:36,177
嗯，你可以回来
到你的细胞

1169
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,304
如果你不希望
去打这场仗。

1170
02:04:38,387 --> 02:04:40,806
或者...

第1171章
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:43,893
你可以加入我。

第1172章
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,480
并为自由而战
远远超出这些墙。

第1173章
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,148
是啊！

第1174章
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:53,527
曾经有一段时间
荣誉在罗马具有某种意义。

第1175章
02:04:55,112 --> 02:04:56,739
在这个罗马

第1176章
02:04:57,531 --> 02:04:59,700
我不再相信
存在的。

第1177章
02:04:59,783 --> 02:05:01,785
我们必须找到它！

1178
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:05,831
并知道这一点：

第1179章
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:10,920
死亡在哪里，我们就不在哪里。

1180
02:05:12,796 --> 02:05:14,840
我们在哪里，

第1181章
02:05:15,466 --> 02:05:17,301
死亡不是！

第1182章
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:21,597
借我剑。

第1183章
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:25,142
实力与荣誉。

1184
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:27,186
实力与荣誉！

1185
02:05:27,269 --> 02:05:28,938
实力与荣誉！

1186
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:30,981
实力与荣誉！

第1187章
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:57,716
Let it not be said

1188
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:00,928
that the emperor
is not merciful.

1189
02:06:01,011 --> 02:06:06,517
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1190
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:10,396
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

1191
02:06:20,364 --> 02:06:24,368
The champion, Hanno!

1192
02:06:28,205 --> 02:06:31,834
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1193
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:39,193
Yes!

1194
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,240
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

1195
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:49,161
This is war! Real war!

1196
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:57,503
The army of Acacius is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1197
02:08:00,047 --> 02:08:01,507
We can still
outflank them.

1198
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:04,051
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

1199
02:08:05,302 --> 02:08:06,804
我们有多少人？

1200
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:08,263
六千。
也许更多。

1201
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:10,015
骑车到门口
并握住它们。

1202
02:09:01,775 --> 02:09:02,943
肮脏的人渣！

1203
02:09:16,707 --> 02:09:18,333
卢修斯！

1204
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:21,170
把弓给我。

1205
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,404
走吧，我的儿子。卢修斯——

1206
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:48,614
嘘嘘嘘嘘……

1207
02:09:48,697 --> 02:09:50,157
马！

1208
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:25,002
什么都不会
杀了这个野蛮人？

1209
02:11:25,085 --> 02:11:27,629
我的名字是
卢修斯·维鲁斯·奥勒留！

1210
02:11:27,713 --> 02:11:30,090
一个人不会成为
皇帝仅凭血统。

1211
02:11:30,173 --> 02:11:32,926
必须用武力夺取
并强行保存。

1212
02:11:33,010 --> 02:11:34,845
你是这样的人吗
像这样？

1213
02:11:34,928 --> 02:11:36,388
我不为权力而战。

1214
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:39,224
我为解放罗马而战
来自像你这样的男人

1215
02:11:39,308 --> 02:11:40,809
并将其归还给他们。

1216
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:43,729
众神本身
希望罗马重生。

1217
02:11:43,812 --> 02:11:46,773
他们送我...
来完成这项任务。

1218
02:11:46,857 --> 02:11:50,444
如果你的神呢
派我来杀你？

1219
02:11:50,527 --> 02:11:51,653
啊？

1220
02:11:52,696 --> 02:11:54,990
是时候结束这一切了，马克林努斯！

1221
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:33,320
哈！

1222
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,685
实力与荣誉，

1223
02:13:05,185 --> 02:13:06,812
我的儿子。

1224
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:41,907
你看着我说话。

1225
02:14:43,992 --> 02:14:45,702
我不知道是什么
说除了

1226
02:14:45,786 --> 02:14:47,913
我们都知道
太多的死亡。

1227
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:52,667
让鲜血不再流淌
以暴政的名义。

1228
02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:59,049
我的祖父，
马库斯·奥勒留，

1229
02:14:59,132 --> 02:15:02,094
谈到一个梦想
那就是罗马。

1230
02:15:03,011 --> 02:15:05,013
我父亲的一个梦想，

1231
02:15:06,139 --> 02:15:08,975
马克西姆斯·德西穆斯·梅里迪乌斯，

第1232章
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:10,685
为之而死。

1233
02:15:11,812 --> 02:15:13,522
一个理想。

1234
02:15:16,149 --> 02:15:20,529
一座适合多人的城市
为有需要的人提供庇护。

1235
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,198
一个值得为之奋斗的家。

1236
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:28,620
马克西姆斯的家
一生都在捍卫。

第1237章
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,541
那个梦想消失了。

1238
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:40,132
但我们敢...

1239
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,302
重建那个梦想
一起？

1240
02:15:56,106 --> 02:15:57,983
你说什么？

1241
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,199
是啊！

1242
02:16:07,242 --> 02:16:08,660
是啊！

1243
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:10,537
是啊！

1244
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:15,083
是啊！是啊！是啊！是啊！

1245
02:17:19,689 --> 02:17:20,982
母亲。

1246
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:15,745
跟我说话吧，神父。
