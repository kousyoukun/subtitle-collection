General Acacius, I have taken you, Midian, your names.

164
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That your dominion may eclipse that of every emperor that came before you.

165
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I'm with Laurel's brother.

166
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In honor of your conquest, there will be games in the coliseum.

167
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I require no games in my honor. Serving the senate and the people of Rome is honor enough for me.

168
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You are too modest, Acacius. It does not suit a general as accomplished as yourself.

169
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Your glory is yours, not mine.

170
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I only ask for some respite from war. To spend time with my wife.

171
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Your wife, yes. Remember the privileges we have granted her?

172
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Where is she now to ignore such an occasion?

173
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
There are victories yet still to come.

174
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Persia, India. Both must be conquered.

175
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Rome has so many subjects. She must feed them.

176
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
They can eat war.

177
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Your triumphs will be celebrated as a tribute to the greatness of the Roman people.

Me? No, no.

389
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
No, I am wrong.

390
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,500
I don't even know how to use an abacus, but I do understand that.

391
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,500
It's customary for your guests to make wages at these fairs.

392
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
How large a sum did you have in mind?

393
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Thousand gold denarii? Two.

394
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Two?

395
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Denarii.

396
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Come back! Come back!

397
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:12,500
My emperors, lords, ladies and gentlemen and senators...

398
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,500
...for your entertainment, the art of combat.

399
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:28,500
May I present the barbarian versus from my own stable, the mighty Vincen!

400
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,500
[Applause]

401
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,500
This is your bad air, sir. It is.

402
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Three rounds, hand to hand. Swords!

403
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,500
We want swords to fight to the death.

404
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,500
No quarter to be offered or given.

405
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Fight now!

406
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500

407
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:04,500

430
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Congratulations.

431
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Thank you.

432
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Remarkable!

433
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,500
From my dehail.

434
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Speak.

435
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,500
I said speak.

436
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,500
He is from the colonies, your majesty, his native tongue is all he understands.

437
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:57,500
The gates of hell are open night and day.

438
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Smooth is the descent and easy is the way.

439
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,500
But...

440
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:19,500
To come back from hell and view the cheerful skies in this the task and mighty labor lies.

441
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Virgil, your majesty.

442
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Poetry!

443
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Very clever, my goodness.

444
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Thank you.

445
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,500
I'm grung some board, but you surprise me.

446
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
To amuse you is my only wish.

447
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
We are amused.

448
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,500
We are amused.

449
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,500
And we all look forward to seeing your poet perform in the arena.

450
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
As do I, your majesty.

451
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Thank you.

452
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,500

454
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,500
You fought well today, but you were lucky too.

455
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,500
The lines you recited.

456
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,500
You didn't learn that in Africa, I know that.

457
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
A good verse travels far.

458
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Well, George, your poetry.

459
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
I captured a Roman officer.

460
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,500
I was posted guard over a good he used to tell his tales to pass the time.

461
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
And what became of this prison?

462
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
How we ate in.

463
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
As barbarians do.

464
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
As barbarians do.

465
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
And where were you born?

466
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,500
Why does my past matter if it is my future to die for you in the arena?

467
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:06,500
[Music]

468
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Tell me what you survived for Roman money.

469
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:15,500
A gladiator can buy his own freedom.

470
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
His liberty.

471
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,500
The Romans read.

472
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,500
The slave brings not freedom, but of a slave to call his own.

473
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Cicero.

474
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Cicero.

475
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Is that what you were raised on, Maccabees?

476
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,500
What did you have to do for Roman money?

477
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,500
You promised being ahead.

478
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Earn your keep and you can have anyone's head.

485
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Alle, I think I wish we were meeting in better times.

486
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Better times will come.

487
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
And why are we here?

488
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,500
To take back the city.

489
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:51,500
And restore Rome to where she should be.

490
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,500
An exciting adventure.

491
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:00,500
When, on the final day of the games, my army waits for my commanded Ostia.

492
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Five thousand soldiers loyal to me.

493
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Will enter Rome and then the Colosseum where they will arrest the emperors for their crimes against the Senate and their people.

494
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,500
This plan is ambitious and risky.

495
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Rome will be yours to administer and to...

496
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Marcus Aurelius talked of restoring power to the Senate.

497
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,500
But that was a generation ago, much has changed.

498
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:38,500
The people have not seen hope for many years.

499
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,500
But with time and guidance.

500
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Lucilla, you are the daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

501
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
He had my loyalty.

502
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,500
And so do you.

503
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Senator Thrax.

504
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Politics follows power, my lady.

505
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Take back what is rightfully yours.

506
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,500
And the Senate will support you.

507
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Thank you.

508
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Thank you.

509
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:37,500
When I was told of this place, they never mentioned the stink.

510
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
That would be Hallo.

511
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,500
You'll have to put up with me as I am.

512
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:55,500
And what's all up there? A wolf.

513
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,500
The twins there, they were outcasts.

514
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Left from the hills to die.

515
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,500
That wolf found them and she supple them on her milk.

516
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Raised by an animal, it's in their blood.

517
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
How do you know this place?

518
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,500
I know the chaos they brought.

519
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,500
This city infects everything it touches.

520
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
I never dreamt it would be so big.

521
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Don't fall for it.

522
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,500
This city is diseased.

About our wages.

Ah, the barbarian, yes, I haven't forgotten. I always repay my debts.

01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,520
I cannot fail him now.

01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
Agnes...

755
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,520
I will willingly give my life for all.

756
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,520
But I will not give my son's.

757
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:34,520
One!

758
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,520
And two!

759
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,520
And one!

760
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,520
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond!

761
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,520
And one!

762
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,520
And two!

763
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,520
And one!

764
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,520
Go, go!

765
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,520
You won't get far like this.

766
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,520
Just him.

767
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,520
You go.

768
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,520
Go.

769
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,520
Let's see how far you can go on your own without your team.

770
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,520
Ready?

771
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,520
One!

772
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,520
And two!

773
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,520
Diamond, diamond!

774
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,520
One more!

775
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:23,520
More!

776
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:42,520
Leave it.

777
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
Go, go!

778
01:16:43,520 --> 01:17:04,520
Just vinegar, my friend.

779
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,520
There will be no more opium for you.

780
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,520
There is plenty of pain waiting for you in the next life.

781
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,520
I don't know why you are so greedy for eating this one.

782
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:23,520
Are you a free man, Ravi?

783
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,520
Free?

784
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,520
I am.

785
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,520
I laid down my sword and I swore never to pick it up again.

786
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,520
Didn't you choose this hell?

787
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,520
What was your hope before?

788
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
What I am asking?

789
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,520
Why don't you go back?

790
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,520
I wish I could.

791
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:50,520
I am not a woman.

792
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,520
There is always a woman.

793
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,520
Always.

794
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,520
She is from Londinio, Italy.

795
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,520
So now, our sons, they speak only Latin.

796
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,520
My daughter's eyes, they are as blue as yours.

797
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,520
We are Romans now.

798
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,520
I grew up hearing stories of my grandfather's knee.

799
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,520
He used to talk of the dream that was wrong.

800
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:24,520
It was so fragile, you could only whisper it.

801
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,520
What a banish.

802
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,520
Son, what was this dream?

803
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,520
A Rome where all could live under fair law and be protected.

804
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,520
A Rome with the Senate.

805
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,520
A Rome of hope.

806
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:50,520
Your grandfather, he sounds like a dangerous man.

807
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:56,520
The odds are against you.

808
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,520
The odds are always against me.

809
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Don't worry, old man.

810
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
You are dead.

811
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:10,520
Should get some rest.

812
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,520
Your men will need you to lead them tomorrow.

813
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:32,520
This is about survival!

814
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520
Survive!

815
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,520
This is the day of the syllabus!

816
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,520
We celebrate the glory of Naboo war.

817
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,520
May the charges be ready to be listened to by command.

818
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,520

819

822

Today, we relive the fact of syllabus!

823
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,520
The churches versus the Persians!

824
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:18,520
Hosea!

825
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,520

Naboo!

Naboo!

831

Naboo!

Naboo!

Naboo!

Naboo!

01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
Naboo!

01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,520

842
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,520

843

844
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,520
Hosea! Hosea!

845
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,520
Hosea!

846
01:21:52,520 --> 01:22:11,520
Ready to rest!

847
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,520
And fight!

848
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,520
Fight!

849
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,520
Fight!

850
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,520
Hosea!

851
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:25,520
Hosea!

852
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,520

862

In the name of the Emperor, the victor is...

863
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,520
Penob!

864
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,520

867
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,520
It was me! I did it!

868
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,520
I will want retribution for all of you.

869
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,520
Did you learn to shoot the same place, to learn to recite poetry?

870
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,520
Be glad it wasn't me or that arrow would have found you.

871

872
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,520
I have news for you.

873
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,520
He's here, sir.

874
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:04,520
Oh, still here!

875
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,520
Ha, ha, back to that.

876
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,520
Well...

877
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,520
Yes, I'm listening.

878
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,520
You know this is my house now.

879
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,520
Your debt to me is over ten thousand denarii.

880
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,520
You know that.

881
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,520

Truth.

886
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,520
That's what I want.

887
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:34,520
Nothing happens in Rome without your knowledge.

888
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,520
You have the Sanity's trust.

889
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,520
You have Lucilla's trust.

890
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,520
More importantly, you have my trust.

891
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,520
Do you see who you wish my loyalty?

892
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,520
I own your house.

893
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,520

898

Who brought this on us?

Don't think I!

1135
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:18,240
Perhaps you should take down this elsewhere to comfort him.

1136
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:30,240
Forgive my brother's outburst.

1137
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:34,240
The disease that infects his loins is spreading his brain.

1138
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,240
Every day gets worse.

1139
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,240
I will reason with him.

Gotta get up. Gotta go.

Come on, stand up. Get up. Get up. Not you.

All right.

Now, listen to me.

01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,240
What's the matter?

1148
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,240
Nothing's ever mine.

1149
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,240
Everything is ours always.

1150
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,240
Even in the womb.

1151
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:27,240
He tried to get my umbilicus.

1152
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,240
So that I couldn't have any more hair.

1153
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,240
You remember that, do you?

1154
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,240
Certainly.

My conscience compels me.

01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,240
Why?

1159
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,240
Sit.

1160
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:46,240
Your brother means to blame you in front of the entire Senate.

1161
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:48,240
But I did not do it.

1162
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,240
Well, what's happening in the streets is the chaos.

1163
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,240
He's lying.

1164
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:57,240
No testimony can be more damning than one brother against another.

1165
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,240
That's a lie. He always lies.

1166
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,240
He can be very persuasive.

1167
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:05,240
So? What will they do to me?

1168
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:08,240
I don't dare imagine, but imagine this.

Put down the blade.

You lied.

01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,240
Give it to me.

Brought me back to the very ground where he died.

The string belonged to my father.

He gave it to your father, Maximus, as a token of trust.

1201

It was a soldier from.

There was a plan.

1210
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:30,240
He was readying troops that lost you under the command of Dioerys Sextus.

Troops he was to lead against the emperors.

Is it true they intend to kill you?

One man or another has had a sword against my neck since the day my father died.

As emperor, I have convened the senate to appoint my first consul.

And bestow upon him the power to administer the military and civic functions of the empire.

I can speak logic to it.

I can tame the madness in the street.

1249
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:45,240
But, in stone order, I must have power and command over the Praetorian army.

His dream of Rome was never a dream.

01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,240
It was a fiction.

1261
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:59,240
The best revenge is to become unlike the one who did the injury.

1262
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:04,240
I have made myself unlike your father.

1263
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:07,240
He spoke of dreams, I speak of truth.

1264
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:12,240
And the only truth in my Rome is that I am your father.

In my Rome is the law of the strongest.

1266

There is an army.

I am asking you to risk yourself, my friend, on the surface of something greater.

02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:23,240
Ravi.

1316
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:24,240
Ravi.

1317
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,240
Ravi.

1318
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,240
Ravi.

1319
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,240
Ravi.

1320
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:28,240
Ravi.

1321
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,240
Ravi.

1322
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,240
Ravi.

1323
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:32,240
Ravi.

1324
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,240
Ravi.

1325
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,240
Ravi.

1326
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,240
Ravi.

1327
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,240
Ravi.

1328
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:09,240
My street gift is served.

1329
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:14,240
Until she dies, you will never know peace.

1330
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:17,240
Never.

1331
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:31,240
If she pulled up, her death will incite the mob.

1332
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,240
If she dies and the street's wires are burning,

1333
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:40,240
I shall drill into them caracalla's head and the people shall acclaim me that my friend is politics.

1334
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,240
Shall we?

1335
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,240
Yes.

1336
02:01:45,240 --> 02:02:02,240
Today will be your last fight, champion.

1337
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:10,240
And our master has bestowed on you the wooden sword of freedom.

1338
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:15,240
But you have to earn it first.

1339
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:18,240
Today, you're going to defend your mother.

1340
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,240
Defend your mother.

1341
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:45,240
Would all steal a point is still a point.

1342
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,240
Wait for me.

1343
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:48,240
Wait for me.

1344
02:02:48,240 --> 02:03:12,240
Wait for me.

1345
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:13,240
Wait for me.

1346
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:43,240
In honour of the acclamation of Emperor Caracalla, First Council Nolmus and Second Council Macrinus,

1347
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:53,240
and as punishment for her conspiracy against the Empire, for her candies against the Emperor's Imperial bloodline,

1348
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:57,240
and for fomenting military mutiny along with her hopefuls,

1349
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:04,240
the Queen will face divine justice at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.

1350
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,240
Aah!

1351
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:31,240
I'm not a general.

1352
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,240
But we are all soldiers.

1353
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:44,240
And up until now, we have fought for nothing more than another day's survival.

1354
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,240
What will you have us do?

1355
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:51,240
Well, you can return to yourselves if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1356
02:04:51,240 --> 02:05:00,240
Or you can join me and fight for a freedom far beyond these walls.

1357
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,240
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1358
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:06,240
There once was a time when honour meant something in Rome.

1359
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:12,240
In this Rome, I no longer believe that exists.

1360
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:14,240
We must find it.

1361
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:23,240
And know that where death is, we are not.

1362
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:30,240
Where we are, death is not.

1363
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:33,240
Why my sword?

1364
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:37,240
Strength another!

1365
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:43,240
Strength another! Strength another! Strength another!

1366
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,240
Strength another!

1367
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:13,240
Let it not be said that the Emperor is not merciful.

1368
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:23,240
The Queen will be granted a single gladiator to defend her against the Praetorian Guard.

1369
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:37,240
The champion, Hanon!

1370
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:41,240
The King is not a knight!

1371
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:44,240
He is a knight!

1372
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:47,240
The Queen is a knight!

1373
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:50,240
The Queen is a knight!

1374
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:53,240
The Queen is a knight!

1375
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:56,240
The Queen is a knight!

1376
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:59,240
The Queen is a knight!

1377
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:02,240
The Queen is a knight!

1378
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:05,240
The Queen is a knight!

1379
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,240
The Queen is a knight!

1380
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,240
The Queen is a knight!

1381
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:14,240
The Queen is a knight!

1382
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:17,240
The Queen is a knight!

1383
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:20,240
The Queen is a knight!

1384
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:23,240
The Queen is a knight!

1385
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:26,240
The Queen is a knight!

1386
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:29,240
The Queen is a knight!

1387
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:32,240
The Queen is a knight!

1388
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:35,240
The Queen is a knight!

1389
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:38,240
The Queen is a knight!

1390
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:58,240
Summon the cavalry. Put this down at once.

1391
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:01,240
This is war! Real war!

1392
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:03,240
War!

1393
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:11,240
The army of Acacis is advancing just outside of Rome, sir.

1394
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:17,240
We can still outfight them. They have only 5,000 troops. No more.

1395
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:19,240
How many are we?

1396
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:21,240
6,000, perhaps more.

1397
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:24,240
Ride to the gate and hold it.

1398
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:26,240
The Queen is a knight!

1399
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:29,240
The Queen is a knight!

1400
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:32,240
The Queen is a knight!

1401
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:35,240
The Queen is a knight!

1402
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:38,240
The Queen is a knight!

1403
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:41,240
The Queen is a knight!

1404
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:44,240

The Queen is a knight!

1422
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,240
Give me the ball.

1423
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:37,240
The Queen is a knight!

1424
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:40,240
The Queen is a knight!

1425
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:43,240
The Queen is a knight!

02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:46,240
The Queen is a knight!

1427
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:49,240
The Queen is a knight!

1428
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:52,240

The Queen is a knight!

1469
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:50,240
I fight for power.

1470
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:54,240
I fight to free Rome from men like you and to return it to them.

1471
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:57,240
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

1472
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:00,240
They sent me to fulfill that task.

1473
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:04,240
And what if your gods sent me here to kill you?

1474
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:09,240
It's time to end this bracklish war!

1475
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:11,240

My grandfather, Marcus Aurelius,

1534
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,240
talked of the dream that would be Rome.

A dream that my father,

02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:20,240
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1537
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:23,240
died for.

02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:26,240
An ideal.

02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:32,240
A city for the many and a refuge for those in need.

1540
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,240
A home worth fighting for.

1541
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:40,240
A home that Maximus spent his life defending.

1542
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:43,240
A dream is lost.
