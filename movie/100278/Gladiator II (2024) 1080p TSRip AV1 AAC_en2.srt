1
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,266
Be gentle, Hannah.

2
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:24,225
Invoke you by your
great names to come to our aid.

3
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:30,766
Defeat the Romans, destroy their ships,
their engines of war, and their soldiers.

4
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,516
We will prevail.

5
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I know.

6
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,983
You did not make an offering today.

7
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,683
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

8
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,350
Where you are, I am too.

9
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:38,226
And where you
are, I am too, forever, my wife.

10
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,683
The wind is too strong.

11
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,975
Furl sail and strike water.

12
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,058
Furl sail, strike water.

13
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,641
Furl sail and strike water.

14
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,225
Strike water.

15
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,975
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

16
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,141
Wherever they go, they
leave destruction and call it peace.

17
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,725
This is the
last free city in Africa, Nova.

18
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,558
Today, we go into battle.

19
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:22,475
Pray that your God is with
you, if he is not, he is no God.

20
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,641
We've nothing to
fear, but death is, we are not.

21
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,208
But we are.

22
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,041
Death is not.

23
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,933
Stay together and listen for my command.

24
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,558
Rise up and you're head out.

25
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,850
Release.

26
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,183
Raise the tower.

27
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,708
Raise the tower.

28
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,266
Back to stone.

29
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,583
Back to stone.

30
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,266
Drop, drop range.

31
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,558
The drop range is stuck.

32
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,308
I'll wait for you.

33
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,933
What damage have they done you?

34
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,351
Lift up.

35
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,375
Easy, easy.

36
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,416
Hold that.

37
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,833
Alley shots.

38
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,226
I am sorry my son.

39
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,416
Hmm.

40
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,833
I have not long.

41
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:42,725
This galley is sailing
us to something I cannot endure.

42
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,350
I am ready to be taken to another place.

43
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,850
Stay here a while longer.

44
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,475
I remember well when
you first were brought to us.

45
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,058
A lonely boy from the
desert, guileless, afraid.

46
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,475
You embraced everything we taught you.

47
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,391
You found that he shut love.

48
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,975
Your soul was replenished.

49
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:18,433
When I die, my ancestors
will meet me in the next world.

50
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,183
Who will meet you?

51
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,750
I know.

52
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,516
I am done.

53
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,308
Do not let them change what you are.

54
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,850
You seen this boy?

55
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,016
Imo, Imo!

56
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,141
You must go alone now, Hano.

57
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,183
Never let them find you.

58
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,016
Go, go.

59
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
In Brigata.

60
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,125
Emperor Caracol.

61
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,166
General Acasis.

62
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,850
I have taken Numidia in your names,

63
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,476
but your dominion may
eclipse that of every emperor

64
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,641
that came before you.

65
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,613
Crown him with laurels, brother.

66
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,433
In honor of your conquest,

67
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,646
there will be games in the Colosseum.

68
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,016
I require no games in my honor.

69
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,016
Serving the Senate and the people of Rome

70
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,016
is honor enough for me.

71
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,308
You are too modest, Acasis.

72
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,516
Does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

73
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,225
Your glory is yours, not mine.

74
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,808
I only ask for some respite from war

75
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,141
to spend time with my wife.

76
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,766
Your wife, yes.

77
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,975
Remember the
privileges we have granted her?

78
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,058
Where is she now to
ignore such an occasion?

79
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,350
There are victories yet still to come.

80
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,166
Persia.

81
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,875
India.

82
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,766
Both must be conquered.

83
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,058
Rome has so many subjects.

84
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,416
She must feed them.

85
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,308
They can eat war.

86
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,767
Your triumphs will be celebrated

87
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,808
as a tribute to the
greatness of the Roman people.

88
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:02,850
Macrinus of
Fisters, master of gladiators.

89
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,750
No mistake votes.

90
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:47,391
You go out of the town councilors.

91
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,850
Distinguished guests.

92
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,558
You gotta write a
pack, citizens of Antia.

93
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:03,308
Behold the fate of
the conquered enemies of Rome.

94
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,766
The barbarian, you
idiots, and their chief,

95
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:13,016
their new god, Lord.

96
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:33,291
Which one is interesting?

97
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,208
I'll fire.

98
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,101
Hold.

99
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,125
Here goes there.

100
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:29,916
General.

101
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:06,875
My lady.

102
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,433
I thank the gods that
brought you back home safe.

103
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,600
Thank the army they protected me.

104
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:26,308
Let me feed you.

105
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,208
Go.

106
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,041
To the wall.

107
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,683
The arena is a sacred temple.

108
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:14,308
For the bravest of you, the
road to glory runs through the arena.

109
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,558
The arena turns slaves into
gladiators and gladiators into free men.

110
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,750
You have worms.

111
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:33,583
I know this one.

112
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,333
He eats monkeys.

113
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,308
Go. Sit. Eat.

114
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,208
You.

115
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,350
I know. Get up.

116
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,891
What is your native
language? I speak them all.

117
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,766
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't.

118
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:17,708
All right.

119
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:21,350
Violence is the universal language.

120
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,141
Vigo, put him through his paces.

121
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,308
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

122
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:38,100
The arena!

123
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,791
Very good.

124
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Very good.

125
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,016
Close him down.

126
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,975
Bring him to me.

127
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,208
Ah!

128
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,750
Strong jaw.

129
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,125
Good arms.

130
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,583
Better smell.

131
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,308
Ah, you would do well.

132
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,750
It is an art.

133
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:23,958
Choosing gladiators.

134
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,350
Some choose entertainers.

135
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,975
Some choose brute force.

136
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,416
I choose rage.

137
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:39,892
Crowd loves blood and they love
those who love blood as much as they do.

138
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,641
And you, my friend, rage,

139
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,725
pours out of you like...

140
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:47,541
like milk.

141
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,891
From a horse tit.

142
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,533
You will be quite the fighter.

143
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:54,916
Not for you.

144
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,645
You're right. You do not fight for me.

145
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,308
I put you in the ring. You
fight or you die. The choice is yours.

146
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:07,433
But whose head could I give
you that would satisfy this fury?

147
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,558
The entire Roman armies.

148
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:14,184
Too much.

149
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,808
The general will do.

150
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,166
General?

151
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,208
General Acacis?

152
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:31,600
Use your rage in my service, then you
will have his head ready for your sword.

153
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,766
Serve me and host serve you. Deny me.

154
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,016
And you will die.

155
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:43,901
At times I will wish you the best.

156
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,475
You should abandon me
rather than fight their wars.

157
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:47,891
I've made my choice.

158
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,141
I can live with it.

159
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:59,141
But my patience
with those two is at an end.

160
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,625
Letter.

161
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,058
You may go to your quarters now.

162
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,891
We need nothing more.

163
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,391
To hear wives and mothers mourning
their dead on that beach at Numidia.

164
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:22,791
Silla.

165
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,208
No more.

166
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:37,100
I will not waste another
generation of young men for their vanity.

167
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:43,058
If I fight another
campaign, it must be to depose them.

168
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,850
When will your troops arrive?

169
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,016
We landed Austrian ten days.

170
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,766
How many of them
will be loyal to you alone?

171
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
All of them.

172
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,516
The empress do not
have the support of the people.

173
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:07,184
The people are weary of
the madness, of the tyranny.

174
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:12,433
What is the dream of Rome?

175
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,416
That people are not free.

176
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,288
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.

177
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,391
To excess.

178
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,642
Thank you.

179
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:51,666
Thank you.

180
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,833
Wow.

181
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,458
Please.

182
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:02,767
Drink.

183
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,309
Ah!

184
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
Excuse me.

185
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,683
I knew the
provinces were not enough for you.

186
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,141
I'm just here for the games.

187
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,208
Ah, well.

188
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,183
You won't be disappointed.

189
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:17,767
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

190
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:19,641
Men like me, Thrax, men like us.

191
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,308
I know nothing happens in
Rome unless you've tasted it first.

192
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,391
How's my purpose here?

193
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,183
We'll find out. It's only now.

194
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,892
What's this we hear
about you being interested

195
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:52,891
in standing for
election to the Senate, Macalus?

196
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,641
Me? No. No, I'm not.

197
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,226
I don't even know how to use an abacus.

198
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,308
But I do understand that it's
customary for your guests to make wages.

199
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,225
How large a sum did you have in mind?

200
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,726
A thousand gold denarii?

201
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,750
Two.

202
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,041
Two?

203
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:18,851
Denarii.

204
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,875
Mmm.

205
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,333
Stand back!

206
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,183
Stand back!

207
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:45,933
My emperors, lords,
ladies and gentlemen, and senators,

208
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,308
for your
entertainment, the art of combat.

209
00:40:53,833 --> 00:41:01,183
May I present the barbarian versus
from my own stable, the mighty Vitek!

210
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,250
This is your radiator.

211
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,808
It is.

212
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:18,225
Three rounds, hand to hand. Swords!

213
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,016
We want swords to fight to the death.

214
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:28,433
No quarter to be
offered or given. Fight now.

215
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,308
Brother, I am the king of the gods.

216
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,883
Let's not kill each
other for their amusement.

217
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:45,625
Remarkable!

218
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:49,958
Remarkable!

219
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:53,516
Drex, you looked expensive for her.

220
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,083
Congratulations.

221
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,125
Thank you.

222
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,250
Remarkable.

223
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,333
From where do you hail?

224
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,541
Speak.

225
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,226
I said speak.

226
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,250
He is from the colonies.

227
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,058
Your Majesty, his native
tongue is all he understands.

228
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,558
The gates of hell are open night and day.

229
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:37,266
Smooth is the descent and easiest away.

230
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:49,833
But to come back from hell
and view the cheerful skies in this,

231
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,684
the task and mighty labor lies.

232
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:01,708
Virgil, your Majesty.

233
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,041
Poetry!

234
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,516
Very clever, my goodness.

235
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:09,666
Thank you.

236
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,350
I've grown so
bored, but you surprised me.

237
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,601
To amuse you is my only wish.

238
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:18,058
We are amused. We are amused.

239
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,416
We are amused.

240
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,350
And we all look forward to
seeing your poet perform in the arena.

241
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,225
As do I, your Majesties.

242
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,375
Thank you.

243
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,808
Vigo, come with me.

244
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:57,766
You fought well
today, but you were lucky too.

245
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,183
The lines you recited.

246
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,225
You didn't learn
that in Africa. I know that.

247
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,308
A good verse travels far.

248
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Who taught you poetry?

249
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,683
A captioned Roman officer.

250
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:17,808
I was posted guard over him, and
he used to tell us tales to pass the time.

251
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,698
And what became of this prison?

252
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,058
How we ate him.

253
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,891
As barbarians do.

254
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,475
As barbarians do.

255
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,250
And where were you born?

256
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:33,100
Why does my past matter if it is
my future to die for you in the arena?

257
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,766
Tell me what you survive for Roman money.

258
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:49,558
A gladiator can buy his own freedom.

259
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,250
His liberty.

260
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,083
The Roman dream.

261
00:45:56,041 --> 00:46:00,100
The slave dreams not of
freedom, but of a slave to call his own.

262
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,333
Cicero.

263
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,596
Is that what you
were raised on, Maccrelas?

264
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,766
What did you have to do for Roman money?

265
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:12,725
You promised me a head.

266
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,383
Earn your keep and
you can have anyone's head.

267
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:48,625
Father, protect us and guide us.

268
00:46:58,875 --> 00:46:59,875
Senators.

269
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,875
My lady.

270
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:10,708
I wish we were meeting in better times.

271
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,766
Better times will come.

272
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,350
And why are we here?

273
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,391
To take back the city.

274
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:25,933
And restore Rome to where she should be.

275
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:28,016
An exciting venture.

276
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,892
When? On the final day of the games.
When? On the final day of the games. When?

277
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:32,225
On the final day of the games.

278
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,225
My army waits for my command at Ostia.

279
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,266
Five thousand soldiers loyal to me.

280
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:45,059
We'll enter Rome and then the Colosseum
where they will arrest the emperors for

281
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,183
their crimes against
the Senate and their people.

282
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:54,016
This plan is ambitious and risky.

283
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,684
Rome will be yours
to administer and to...

284
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:02,058
Marcus Aurelius talked of
restoring power to the Senate.

285
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:05,558
But that was a
generation ago. Much has changed.

286
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,600
The people have not seen hope.

287
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,225
For many years.

288
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:13,375
But with time.

289
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:15,875
And guidance.

290
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:20,516
Lucilla, you are the
daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

291
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,475
He had my loyalty.

292
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,350
And so do you.

293
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:30,391
Senator Thraxx.

294
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,225
Politics follows power, my lady.

295
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,308
Take back what is rightfully yours.

296
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:43,183
And the Senate will support you.

297
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,041
Thank you.

298
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:11,308
When I was told of this
place, you never mentioned the stink.

299
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,808
That would be Hanos.

300
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,391
Well, you'll have
to put up with me as I am.

301
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:29,016
And what's that up there? A wolf?

302
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,350
The twins there, they were outcasts.

303
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:36,016
Left in the hills to die.

304
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,933
That wolf found them.
She suckled them on her milk.

305
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,891
Raised by an
animal that's in their blood.

306
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,080
How do you know this place?

307
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:50,808
I know the chaos they brought.

308
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,600
This city infects everything it touches.

309
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,183
I never dreamt it would be so big.

310
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:00,808
Don't fall for it. This city is diseased.

311
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:50,041
The No way!

312
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,375
Ah!

313
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:21,058
Stare speakers and happy honeyfuckers.

314
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,851
Ah, the barbarian.

315
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:24,726
I haven't forgotten.

316
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,351
I always repay my debts.

317
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,017
I was merely going to suggest

318
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,226
that perhaps your luck might change,

319
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,850
shall we say double of things.

320
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:12,391
Light up, light up.

321
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,183
Lay, lay.

322
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,683
Emperor Katicala,

323
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,225
Emperor Gator,

324
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,850
citizens of Rome.

325
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:16,891
These sacred games are
held to honor the victory of Rome

326
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,058
over the barbarians of Numidia.

327
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:29,725
And honor Rome's legionary commander,

328
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,641
General Eustace Acacius.

329
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,975
And with him, Lucilla,

330
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,641
the daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

331
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,250
Acacius.

332
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,083
General.

333
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Speak to them.

334
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:23,683
I am not an orator or a politician.

335
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,750
I am a soldier.

336
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:34,183
I've seen bravery in
men and women during war,

337
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,016
and even once in this arena.

338
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,725
So if you ask anything of the gods,

339
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,183
ask for that same bravery.

340
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,725
Because Rome needs it now.

341
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:13,850
From the South Gate,

342
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:18,975
bakers from the
stable of Matronos of Vistrus.

343
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:37,558
From the stables of
Emperors Calicalla and Gator themselves,

344
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:42,766
the undefeated
champion, Glissero the Destroyer.

345
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,875
Oh!

346
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,750
Oh!

347
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,625
Help, Jesus!

348
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:38,850
Hold together and when
the charges break for the wall.

349
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:40,666
Why should I?

350
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:47,308
Hold, hold!

351
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:51,291
Cows!

352
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,850
Brother, is that poet, is it not?

353
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,333
I can't remember.

354
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:10,416
That night was a blur.

355
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:15,100
The gates of hell are open night and day.

356
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,766
Smooth as I forget.

357
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:19,850
Smooth as the scent.

358
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,308
Smooth as the scent.

359
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:24,708
Easy as the way.

360
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,750
Kill!

361
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:16,541
Brother.

362
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,750
You sit.

363
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:22,708
Shall we show mercy?

364
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:24,541
Mercy.

365
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:40,833
No mercy!

366
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:43,934
Your life has been spared by the gods.

367
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,766
I will sooner face your blade

368
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,766
than accept Roman mercy.

369
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,851
Kill!

370
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:05,726
Kill!

371
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,642
Kill!

372
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:07,351
Kill!

373
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:08,226
Kill!

374
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,101
Kill!

375
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:09,934
Kill!

376
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:10,767
Kill!

377
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:11,791
Kill!

378
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,293
The road to freedom
doesn't run through the arena.

379
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,750
Leads to this.

380
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,041
Go to yourself.

381
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,850
Now let's go.

382
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:48,475
Gates of hell are open night and day.

383
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,016
Smooth as the descent.

384
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,183
Easiest away.

385
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Dad, Dad.

386
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:03,683
And I bought you an
maximus, the single road.

387
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,058
It's got to end our gentle.

388
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:40,708
Lucius is safe.

389
01:03:58,666 --> 01:03:59,666
Lucius.

390
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Lucius.

391
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,766
You're the sole heir to the throne now.

392
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,641
There are men who want to
kill you so they can take power.

393
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,600
I promise I'll bring
you back as soon as I'm safe.

394
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:29,391
Mother, why can't you come with me?

395
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:33,016
I have to stay here for your sake.

396
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,116
I'm here for the sake of room.

397
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:39,058
Remember who you are and that I love you.

398
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:41,891
I love you.

399
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,208
Come.

400
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,250
Give me your leg.

401
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,641
Go, go.

402
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,125
So.

403
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:04,416
What's your name?

404
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:08,791
I'm Ravi.

405
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,208
I'm Doctor.

406
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:15,017
Because more men die of infected wounds

407
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,266
than out there in the arena.

408
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,183
This needs to be
cleaned, needs to be stitched,

409
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,100
and it is going to hurt.

410
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:28,266
This is devil's breath and opium.

411
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:35,558
It's for the pain you should breathe in.

412
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,558
I've been here so long now.

413
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,183
They don't even notice anymore.

414
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:46,350
I've done more
amputations than I can count.

415
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,450
Where do you learn your trade?

416
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:50,583
Why do you ask?

417
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:51,850
You've got a heavy hand.

418
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,101
I used to be a gladiator myself.

419
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,125
Yeah.

420
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,016
What would you have
bested me in your prime course?

421
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,600
In your current
state, I could best you now.

422
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:08,808
Luckily for you, I have put down my sword

423
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:12,434
so now I spend my days saving lives

424
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,391
instead of taking them.

425
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,725
Why such a change so late in life?

426
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:23,225
What we do in life echoes in eternity.

427
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,850
I feel like I know those words.

428
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:31,934
I can't take credit.

429
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,766
It's written on one of the tombs.

430
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,058
With the bones of a gladiator.

431
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:40,433
My champion, I smell devil's breath.

432
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,083
My.

433
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:48,558
Champion, did you hear that crowd?

434
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:53,666
Did you hear that crowd?

435
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,125
You have something.

436
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,975
I knew it from the start.

437
01:06:59,416 --> 01:06:59,892
Did you now?

438
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:07,891
Yes, the Greeks
call it thymos, smoke, rage.

439
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:10,850
That rage is your gift.

440
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:16,391
Like the great Achilles, never let it go.

441
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:21,225
It will carry you
to greatness, my champion.

442
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,975
Thank you for inviting me.

443
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,850
This is truly an honor.

444
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:54,933
I hear you are the talk of the court.

445
01:07:57,166 --> 01:07:58,166
Yes.

446
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,125
We met before.

447
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,976
Have we?

448
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Long ago.

449
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,750
Where?

450
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,309
I was in the
service of your father's army

451
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,641
on this African campaign.

452
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:12,975
You served with my father.

453
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:18,416
Hmm.

454
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:23,683
I had the privilege
of reading his meditations.

455
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,208
Hmm.

456
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:32,309
The best revenge is to be unlike him

457
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,766
who performed the injury.

458
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,351
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

459
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:44,183
in the entire
empire, and here, now, in Rome,

460
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:48,475
you're gaining
influence by sponsoring gladiators.

461
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,558
I do it for the love of the sport.

462
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,600
And where did you find these gladiators?

463
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:59,725
They're usually
prisoners of war or vagrants.

464
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:01,208
Why do you ask?

465
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:07,934
A man can choose to fight and stay alive.

466
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:10,225
It's the same in life as
it is in the arena, is it not?

467
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,458
Who is this?

468
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,641
That is my father as a youth.

469
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,726
She had a child.

470
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,750
Hmm.

471
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,351
It's common
knowledge when comatose was killed,

472
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,391
the boy disappeared.

473
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:29,142
Hmm.

474
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,166
Well, he would care.

475
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,416
Silla would care.

476
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,500
More wine!

477
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:33,583
More wine.

478
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:38,058
He was of the royal bloodline, after all.

479
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:41,583
And his father?

480
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,250
Ostensibly.

481
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,750
Lucius Verus.

482
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,475
You see, it was an arranged marriage.

483
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:49,683
She was 14.

484
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:53,016
Females were not his taste.

485
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,434
Not mine, some days.

486
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,458
Not yours.

487
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,017
No, no, no.

488
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,975
By rumor, you see, she took lovers,

489
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:04,391
and by rumor, the
real father was comatose.

490
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:07,266
Brotherly love, you see.

491
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,766
If he died, there has to be remains.

492
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,100
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

493
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:18,766
Well, let's work it out.

494
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:21,766
He was about 12 when he died.

495
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:22,601
Yes.

496
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:25,225
So that would make him...

497
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,125
My lady.

498
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,250
Crackers.

499
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:06,601
Here's the cold.

500
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:07,625
Thank you.

501
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,750
Gladiator.

502
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,266
Do you know me?

503
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:34,666
Hmm.

504
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:39,833
Do you have a family?

505
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,391
A wife?

506
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,125
Arishat?

507
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:48,791
Arishat?

508
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,308
She was killed
under your husband's commands.

509
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,184
For all drowns in its own blood.

510
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:59,225
And yet you enjoy the
pleasures of the Colosseum.

511
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:02,475
There's much you do not understand.

512
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:11,934
Duchess.

513
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:14,058
I do not know who you think I am.

514
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,851
My name is Hano, and I have no mother

515
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,058
or none that I can remember.

516
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,141
I'm so sorry.

517
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,433
If you're somewhere here,

518
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,766
I would tell you not to grieve him,

519
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,392
for he would not be
the boy that you sent away.

520
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:37,058
That boy is dead.

521
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,183
You may think I have little worth.

522
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:45,266
You may think I betrayed you.

523
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,891
But I need you to know,

524
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:52,850
if you will not have your mother's love

525
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,100
and take your father's strength,

526
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:58,916
you need it.

527
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,516
His name was Maximus Decimus Mervidius.

528
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,350
And I see him in you.

529
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:09,791
Get out.

530
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,100
My lady, we must go at once.

531
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,350
It's just you were loved.

532
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,725
By myself and by your father.

533
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,683
Your name was on his lips.

534
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:27,958
Get out!

535
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,500
Lucius is alive.

536
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,375
Are you certain?

537
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:01,125
Yes.

538
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,641
I know my son.

539
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,308
I spoke to him tonight.

540
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:14,975
He may be lost to me for what I did.

541
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:17,791
But he lives.

542
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,350
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

543
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,683
Most fighters won't survive.

544
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:24,916
The cases.

545
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:27,416
You must help him.

546
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:29,850
Help him? Yes.

547
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:35,183
I failed him then.

548
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,500
I know I did.

549
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:41,183
I cannot fail him now.

550
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,766
The army is in Ostia.

551
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,516
If we wait a few days.

552
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,850
He could be dead by then.

553
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
The cases.

554
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:55,101
I would willingly give my life forever.

555
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:57,391
Willingly give my life from...

556
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,975
But I will not give my sons.

557
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,166
One!

558
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:11,433
And two!

559
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,250
And one!

560
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:16,708
And one!

561
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,433
And one!

562
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:20,583
And two!

563
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,666
And two!

564
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:24,541
And one!

565
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:30,101
And one!

566
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,475
You won't get far like this.

567
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,141
Just him.

568
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,750
You go.

569
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:36,833
Go.

570
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,225
Let's see how far you can
go on your own without your team.

571
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:43,666
Ready?

572
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,291
One!

573
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,725
And two!

574
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,208
Diamond, diamond!

575
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,350
Come on, more!

576
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
More!

577
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:16,225
Leave it.

578
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:40,475
Just vinegar, my friend. Ah.

579
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:42,850
There will be no more opium for you.

580
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:48,558
There is plenty of pain
waiting for you in the next life.

581
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,850
Are you a free man, Ravi?

582
01:16:58,875 --> 01:16:59,875
Free.

583
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:02,708
I am.

584
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:07,683
I laid down my sword and I
swore never to pick it up again.

585
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,141
And yet you choose this home.

586
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,541
Mm-hmm.

587
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,266
What was your home before?

588
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,750
But I'm Asi.

589
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:16,391
And why don't you go back?

590
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,583
I wish I could.

591
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:20,416
Asi.

592
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,375
I met a woman.

593
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,850
It's always a woman. Afterwards.

594
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,183
She's from Lomdinium, Britannia.

595
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:36,850
So now, our sons, they speak only Latin.

596
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,225
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

597
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:43,958
We are Romans now.

598
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:47,558
I grew up hearing
stories at my grandfather's knee.

599
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,225
He used to talk the dream that was Rome.

600
01:17:54,125 --> 01:18:00,183
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it.

601
01:18:01,416 --> 01:18:02,416
Or it would vanish.

602
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,041
So...

603
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,750
What was this dream?

604
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:11,183
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

605
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:13,875
A Rome with the Senate.

606
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:17,375
A Rome with hope.

607
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:22,225
Your grandfather, he sounds like a...

608
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:25,433
Like a dangerous man.

609
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:31,016
The odds are against you.

610
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,725
The odds are always against me.

611
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,141
Don't worry old man.

612
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:44,433
You should get some rest.

613
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:48,306
Your men will need
you to lead them to me.

614
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,891
It's about survival!

615
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:09,666
Survive!

616
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:17,016
In the name of Poseidon, we
celebrate the glory of naval war.

617
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,766
May your marches be
ready to listen for my command.

618
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,891
We are together as cool as one, yes?

619
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,184
Yes!

620
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:27,208
Yes!

621
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:36,208
Today, we relive the Battle of Salamis!

622
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,641
The Trojans versus the Persians!

623
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:52,791
Pose out!

624
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:55,101
And pull!

625
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,125
Pull!

626
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,416
Order on!

627
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,125
Order!

628
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,125
Pull!

629
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:39,350
Pull!

630
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,250
Pull!

631
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,125
On time!

632
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,225
On time!

633
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,100
Let's die! Ready?

634
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,766
And two more down!

635
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:03,016
Push in! Push in!

636
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,183
Get down!

637
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:24,291
Pull!

638
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Pull!

639
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:28,333
Pull!

640
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,125
Don't shoot!

641
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:31,958
Don't shoot!

642
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,125
Pull!

643
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Pull!

644
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,391
Ready to ram!

645
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:48,791
And run!

646
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:50,833
Freeze!

647
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,225
Get him off!

648
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:31,583
Everybody, be free!

649
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:09,350
Just don't react!

650
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,350
Pull, pull.

651
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:26,166
In the name of the
Emperor, the victor is...

652
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:29,058
Hanno!

653
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,641
Forget this!

654
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:47,600
Who did this?

655
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:49,541
It was me!

656
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:50,476
I did it!

657
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,500
I did it!

658
01:23:57,416 --> 01:24:00,100
Gaeta will want
retribution for all of you.

659
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:03,181
Did you learn to shoot the
same place you learned to recite poetry?

660
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,391
Be glad it wasn't me or
that arrow would have found you.

661
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,041
Be seated.

662
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,225
I have news for you.

663
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,475
He's here, sir.

664
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,475
Oh, you're here.

665
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:41,583
Back in the...

666
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:43,416
work.

667
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:46,625
Yes, I'm listening.

668
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,516
You know this is my house now.

669
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,100
Your debt to me is over 10,000 denarii.

670
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:54,101
You know that.

671
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:58,808
I have other things. Cattle. Art!

672
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:00,250
Truth, then.

673
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:02,225
What do you want?

674
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:04,350
Truth. That's what I want.

675
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:09,350
Nothing happens in
Rome without your knowledge.

676
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,100
You have the senator's trust.

677
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,100
You have Lucilla's trust.

678
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,891
More importantly, you have my trust.

679
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:24,308
You wish my loyalty.

680
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:28,850
I own your house.

681
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,808
I want your loyalty.

682
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,500
I...

683
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:45,101
I have heard of a
plot to dethrone the emperors.

684
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,125
Yes.

685
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,725
But the plan has been delayed.

686
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:53,391
Our gladiator is to be
rescued from the arena tonight.

687
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,434
I know not one.

688
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:56,808
I know why. I know who.

689
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,458
Pac.

690
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,225
Quickly.

691
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,850
Open for the emperor's guard.

692
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:25,308
My lady.

693
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:27,225
Come with us.

694
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:18,183
Thanks to the civic virtue
of men like Thrax and Macronus,

695
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:23,308
your insurrection has been revealed.

696
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:32,850
The honor, the dignitas
that Rome has bestowed upon you,

697
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:37,350
all this you have
forfeited by your treachery.

698
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:44,725
Please, the embracada, torture
me if you want, but do not lecture me.

699
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:47,225
Your name will be forgotten!

700
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,683
Lost to history!

701
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:55,558
You are damned, Jimmy.

702
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,184
You laugh.

703
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,208
You damn me.

704
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,333
I don't care.

705
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:06,600
Everything is forgotten in
time, empires fall, so do emperors.

706
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:07,916
Why wait?

707
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:09,583
I will guard him!

708
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,475
Come, come!

709
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:16,101
His death must be public.

710
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:17,125
Public?

711
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:23,350
Hang his entrails from
the city gates and crucify her!

712
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,726
Crucify her!

713
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:26,750
Take them away!

714
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:45,225
Thank you, Macronus.

715
01:29:56,125 --> 01:30:00,850
In these last days, I have
come to think of you not as a subject,

716
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,350
but as a true friend.

717
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:04,791
Thank you.

718
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:10,183
Thank you so much, but as
a friend, I must counsel caution.

719
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:13,183
Akatas is a hero of Rome,

720
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,558
crucifixion is for thieves, Christians.

721
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:21,851
He's too common.

722
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,516
He is a traitor. He must die.

723
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:25,041
I agree.

724
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:30,808
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

725
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,225
Let the gods decide.

726
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:45,600
You know, last night I
woke dreaming of the dark river.

727
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:52,016
This time, the
first time, I was crossing it.

728
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:55,266
You know where I come from?

729
01:30:56,708 --> 01:31:01,475
Crossing a river, it represents
forgiveness, it represents salvation.

730
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,831
Oh, where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

731
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:07,808
As I saw it, I was not afraid.

732
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,183
For someone who was
waiting for me on the other side.

733
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Who is this man?

734
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:41,809
Scratched out? I'm sorry. What the hell? Who is this man? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who is this man?
Who is this man? Who is this man? Who is this man? What is he? Who is this man? Scratched out.

735
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:42,833
Maximus.

736
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,808
I saw him fight once.

737
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:50,541
He was magnificent.

738
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:57,766
My time in the arena, it was after his,
but many still talked of him in with Faz.

739
01:31:58,541 --> 01:32:00,058
Spoke of him.

740
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,750
What he did.

741
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,750
I met him once.

742
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:07,291
He was kind.

743
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:12,891
He bowed to no one.

744
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:17,125
Come with me.

745
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:20,225
Come with me.

746
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:43,225
When a rebel
gladiator dies, we bury them.

747
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,601
Here.

748
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,850
What we do in life echoes an eternity.

749
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:09,225
This is Argento, Mrs. Scato.

750
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:50,766
There.

751
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:53,750
And stop.

752
01:33:55,375 --> 01:34:00,642
For his treason against the lives of the

753
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:07,266
emperors and the Roman
state, General Eustace Acacia,

754
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:11,391
an enemy of the people.

755
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,101
We are your ancestors!

756
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,100
Ray Victus. General.

757
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:56,291
Get in!

758
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:34,433
From the vanquished city of Numidia,

759
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:40,891
the victor of two
conquests in the Colosseum...

760
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,850
Go now. Vay Victus.

761
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:52,125
Hello!

762
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:57,351
Oh, Lord, any honour I
have, I will give it to you.

763
01:35:57,375 --> 01:35:58,142
It's too late.

764
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:03,391
The Roman traitor or the barbarian hero?

765
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,100
Let the gods decide.

766
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:07,683
Vay Victus, wait.

767
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:10,475
Wait! Wait!

768
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,808
I am a vessel.

769
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,141
Fill me with vengeance.

770
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,850
Invite with the betrayal.

771
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:55,891
Pick it up!

772
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:58,225
No, no, no, no!

773
01:36:58,333 --> 01:36:59,850
We love you, Acacia!

774
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:02,183
What are you waiting for? He was nice!

775
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:26,541
I know who you are.

776
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:37,641
Lucius Varys Aurelius.

777
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,391
Acacia has raised his hand!

778
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:55,933
He has surrendered!

779
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,225
Let the gods decide!

780
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:26,266
The gods have rented their judgement.

781
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,125
Do what you must.

782
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,016
But on my death you have to know...

783
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:38,225
I love your mother, Lucilla.

784
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:41,375
And your father.

785
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:45,666
Maximus...

786
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,600
I would have died for him.

787
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:50,600
Kill him!

788
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:52,391
That's it, babe!

789
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:06,600
Kill him!

790
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,516
Don't kill him!

791
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,267
I can't!

792
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:12,017
No!

793
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:13,041
Kill him!

794
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,125
Kill him!

795
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:18,059
Kill him!

796
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:19,059
Kill him!

797
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,083
Kill him!

798
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,184
Acacia!

799
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,208
Acacia!

800
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,250
Acacia!

801
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:29,266
No!

802
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:36,541
No!

803
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:38,125
Acacia!

804
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:42,641
I'll damn you!

805
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,808
Death will be too good for you!

806
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:54,350
Is this how Rome treats its hero?

807
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:00,850
Tell me!

808
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:07,183
If his life has no
value, what do yours want?

809
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:11,808
The gods have spoken!

810
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,808
For our own safety, we
should return to the palace.

811
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:11,225
Stay back! Stay back!

812
01:42:22,125 --> 01:42:23,600
We had a bargain.

813
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:29,183
I gave him to you.

814
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:31,125
You let him live.

815
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:32,641
And you got what you wanted.

816
01:42:32,791 --> 01:42:34,101
I always get what I want.

817
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:35,183
Why did you let him live?

818
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,975
You bought a gladiator, not a slave.

819
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:41,975
My will is my own.

820
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:45,125
Ah.

821
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:47,391
How blue is your blood?

822
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:52,266
Perhaps the heart of
a Roman beats in that chest.

823
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:03,183
The greatest temple
Rome ever built, the Colosseum,

824
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:06,683
because this is
what they believe in, power.

825
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:10,809
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down of the...

826
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:11,892
There has to be something else.

827
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:12,726
There is nothing else.

828
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,142
There has to be another Rome.

829
01:43:14,166 --> 01:43:15,350
There is no other Rome.

830
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,083
The dream?

831
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:19,708
The dream of Rome?

832
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:22,016
It's an old man's fantasy.

833
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,141
Who are you?

834
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:30,975
What was your name before
you traded it for a Roman one?

835
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,516
You'll never know.

836
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:37,750
I have a destiny.

837
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,600
The gods delivered you to me.

838
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:48,308
You will be my instrument.

839
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,281
I will never be your
instrument in this life for the next.

840
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:02,850
That will not be my destiny.

841
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:07,350
But I will see your end.

842
01:44:11,791 --> 01:44:19,791
What else could I do?

843
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:32,309
He and his pigs were plotting to kill us.

844
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,516
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads.

845
01:44:35,291 --> 01:44:38,059
The Platorians will put down
this crowd like they have every other.

846
01:44:38,083 --> 01:44:38,976
You brought this on us.

847
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,309
Shoo!

848
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:47,333
Perhaps you should take
Dondys elsewhere to comfort him.

849
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:03,433
Forgive my brother's outburst.

850
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:08,725
The disease that infects
his loins has spread to his brain.

851
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:10,850
Every day gets worse.

852
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:12,225
I will reason with him.

853
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,641
I see you.

854
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:34,350
I see you.

855
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:37,350
Gotta get on, gotta get on.

856
01:45:37,833 --> 01:45:38,850
Come on, stand up.

857
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:40,933
Get up, get up, not you.

858
01:45:41,583 --> 01:45:42,766
All right, here you go.

859
01:45:45,125 --> 01:45:46,766
Now, listen to me.

860
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,041
What's the matter?

861
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:50,975
Nothing's ever mine.

862
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:53,891
Everything is ours always.

863
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,183
Even in the womb, you try it.

864
01:45:58,125 --> 01:46:03,850
Do I get my umbilicus so
that I couldn't have any more hair?

865
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:05,350
You remember that, do you?

866
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:06,517
Certainly.

867
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:06,976
Sit.

868
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,100
One cannot forget.

869
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,016
My conscience compels me.

870
01:46:11,041 --> 01:46:12,041
What?

871
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:13,767
Sit.

872
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:20,391
Your brother means to blame
you in front of the entire Senate.

873
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,517
But I did not do it.

874
01:46:22,541 --> 01:46:24,850
Well, what's
happening in the streets? The chaos.

875
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:26,101
He's lying.

876
01:46:26,125 --> 01:46:31,766
No testimony can be more
damning than one brother against another.

877
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:34,683
That's a lie. He always lies.

878
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:36,475
He can be very persuasive.

879
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,808
So, what will they do to me?

880
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:42,183
I don't dare imagine, but imagine this.

881
01:46:42,916 --> 01:46:44,350
What will they do to Dondys?

882
01:46:48,125 --> 01:46:51,101
What will they do to Dondys?

883
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:52,125
To Dondys?

884
01:46:55,458 --> 01:46:56,458
It's your decision.

885
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:27,558
Help me, young man!

886
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:35,291
Brother.

887
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:39,391
Put down the blade.

888
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:41,183
You lie.

889
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:42,226
Give it to me.

890
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,476
You always lie.

891
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,392
Give it to me.

892
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:48,808
Look at me.

893
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:50,101
Look at me.

894
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:51,125
Lie!

895
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:53,141
Let me break this spell.

896
01:47:53,458 --> 01:47:53,976
Lie!

897
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Break this spell.

898
01:47:55,166 --> 01:47:56,892
I've always protected you.

899
01:47:56,916 --> 01:47:57,916
Because I love you.

900
01:47:59,166 --> 01:48:00,101
Come back.

901
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,141
Help me.

902
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,250
Help me.

903
01:48:45,166 --> 01:48:46,142
Doucheous.

904
01:48:46,166 --> 01:48:49,225
Never could have
imagined the fates would lead us here.

905
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:53,350
And yet here we are.

906
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:56,892
Everything has brought us full circle.

907
01:48:56,916 --> 01:48:58,808
You sent me away and you had fate.

908
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:02,225
Brought me back to
the very ground where he died.

909
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:09,391
This ring belonged to my father.

910
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:18,225
He gave it to your
father, Maximus, as a token of trust.

911
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:23,391
I gave it to Cacius for his valor.

912
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:29,600
This ring belonged to my wife.

913
01:49:33,291 --> 01:49:34,600
I shall wear it next to yours.

914
01:49:48,125 --> 01:49:50,641
I'm truly sorry for Cacius.

915
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:54,850
I could not see the man.

916
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:58,891
He was a soldier from...

917
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,101
There was a plan.

918
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:07,766
He was readying troops at
Ostia under the command of Darius Cixtus.

919
01:50:09,166 --> 01:50:11,100
Troops he was to
lead against the emperors.

920
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:17,725
Cacius, Maximus, Marcus Aurelius.

921
01:50:19,416 --> 01:50:20,891
They lived and died for Rome.

922
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:23,333
We all do.

923
01:50:25,125 --> 01:50:27,183
Is it true they intend to kill you?

924
01:50:28,125 --> 01:50:35,058
One man or another has had a sword against
my neck since the day my father died.

925
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:42,850
But now that I've
found you, it doesn't matter.

926
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:46,208
I am not afraid.

927
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:49,100
I've become well versed
in losing the things that I love.

928
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:53,101
But now that I've found you,
I have no desire to lose you again.

929
01:50:53,125 --> 01:51:00,183
You stand like him.

930
01:51:02,041 --> 01:51:03,041
Alert.

931
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,208
Proud.

932
01:51:07,458 --> 01:51:08,850
I do not have his strength.

933
01:51:09,666 --> 01:51:12,391
I wish that were true.

934
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,683
I wish I were
telling you to free this place.

935
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:26,850
Go now.

936
01:51:35,875 --> 01:51:36,875
Strength and honor.

937
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:40,458
Strength and honor.

938
01:51:53,916 --> 01:52:00,809
As emperor, I have convened
the Senate to appoint my first consul

939
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:04,517
and bestow upon
him the power to administer

940
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:08,016
the military and
civic functions of the empire.

941
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:16,725
I name Citizen Dardas!

942
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,350
Hail Dardas!

943
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:30,766
Hail Dardas!

944
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:34,601
Hail Dardas.

945
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:35,625
Hail Dardas!

946
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:37,125
Hail Dardas!

947
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:43,850
As second consul,

948
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:47,641
I name

949
01:52:50,125 --> 01:52:51,125
Citizen

950
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:54,266
Macronus.

951
01:52:57,125 --> 01:52:59,183
Hail Macronus!

952
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:00,808
Hail Macronus!

953
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:02,350
Hail Macronus!

954
01:53:04,125 --> 01:53:06,391
There will be a
triumphal parade to celebrate.

955
01:53:07,166 --> 01:53:08,166
There will be games

956
01:53:10,125 --> 01:53:11,225
and mass executions.

957
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:16,683
Long live the empire.

958
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:20,125
Long live the empire.

959
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:29,225
Sit down.

960
01:53:33,375 --> 01:53:35,850
I happen to have,

961
01:53:39,125 --> 01:53:42,683
with good fortune and not a little skill,

962
01:53:45,041 --> 01:53:47,433
the remaining emperors here.

963
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:56,225
I can speak logic to it.

964
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:04,350
And tame the madness in the street.

965
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:05,541
But,

966
01:54:07,875 --> 01:54:08,875
do we still order?

967
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:12,666
I must have power

968
01:54:17,125 --> 01:54:21,350
and command over the Platorian army.

969
01:54:28,125 --> 01:54:29,125
Ballot?

970
01:54:31,666 --> 01:54:32,666
Or hand?

971
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:41,891
Your humble servant.

972
01:54:45,125 --> 01:54:48,100
Put your hands down.

973
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:51,375
You can sit down.

974
01:55:01,125 --> 01:55:02,225
So,

975
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:03,808
I'm fine.

976
01:55:06,041 --> 01:55:07,058
Rome must fall.

977
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:11,683
I need to only give it a push.

978
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:16,891
And after Rome falls,

979
01:55:19,125 --> 01:55:20,266
what then?

980
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:24,433
You are your father's child.

981
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:29,101
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

982
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:31,558
It was a fiction.

983
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:38,891
The best revenge is to become
unlike the one who did the injury.

984
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:43,766
I have made myself unlike your father.

985
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:45,541
He spoke of dreams,

986
01:55:46,041 --> 01:55:47,141
I speak of truth,

987
01:55:47,583 --> 01:55:49,558
and the only truth in my Rome

988
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:52,933
is the law of the strongest.

989
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:56,142
I was owned

990
01:55:56,166 --> 01:55:59,766
by an emperor.

991
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:04,891
Now I control an empire.

992
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:09,266
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

993
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:19,141
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

994
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:23,183
If there is anything,

995
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:27,266
if there is anything you need,

996
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:30,766
in these last hours,

997
01:56:32,125 --> 01:56:33,125
we will provide.

998
01:56:39,666 --> 01:56:42,308
Your death will
clear my path to the throne.

999
01:56:44,291 --> 01:56:46,725
Tomorrow, there will be games,

1000
01:56:47,458 --> 01:56:48,458
and at them,

1001
01:56:49,916 --> 01:56:50,916
I will prevail.

1002
01:56:53,125 --> 01:57:01,125
Robbie!

1003
01:57:07,666 --> 01:57:15,266
Can you get me a
message to Ostia by morning?

1004
01:57:15,958 --> 01:57:16,958
What is it, Ostia?

1005
01:57:17,291 --> 01:57:18,291
There is an army.

1006
01:57:20,125 --> 01:57:22,976
I'm asking you to
risk yourself, my friend,

1007
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,641
on the surface of something greater.

1008
01:57:28,083 --> 01:57:29,083
Ride to Ostia.

1009
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:33,350
Take this ring to General
Darius Sextus, are you listening?

1010
01:57:34,958 --> 01:57:36,391
Darius Sextus?

1011
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:39,058
You will know it as a caseus's ring.

1012
01:57:43,125 --> 01:57:44,308
And, uh,

1013
01:57:45,125 --> 01:57:46,516
who shall I say is

1014
01:57:47,125 --> 01:57:48,225
sent me with this ring?

1015
01:57:50,125 --> 01:57:54,433
I am Lucius Verus Eradius,

1016
01:57:55,208 --> 01:57:57,266
the Prince of Rome.

1017
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,141
Tell him I am summoning the
army to the defense of a new republic.

1018
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,851
Should I trust you?

1019
01:58:12,875 --> 01:58:13,309
Yes.

1020
01:58:13,333 --> 01:58:14,101
Should I?

1021
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:15,125
Yes.

1022
01:58:21,791 --> 01:58:23,808
Robbie, I need your keys.

1023
01:58:30,125 --> 01:58:31,225
Thank you.

1024
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:08,125
No!

1025
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:12,125
Come back!

1026
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,500
Who gave you this?

1027
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:46,101
Lucius Verus Eradius?

1028
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,225
The Prince of Rome?

1029
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:44,975
A street kill, Lucerne.

1030
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:51,100
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1031
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:54,333
Ever.

1032
02:01:04,125 --> 02:01:07,891
If the people love her,
her death will incite the mob.

1033
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:10,600
If she dies and the
streets rise up in anger,

1034
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,392
I shall deliver them Caracalla's head,

1035
02:01:12,416 --> 02:01:15,225
and the people shall
acclaim me that my friend is...

1036
02:01:17,291 --> 02:01:20,683
Shall we?

1037
02:01:20,833 --> 02:01:21,833
Yes.

1038
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:32,208
Today will be your last fight, Champion.

1039
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:42,183
And our master has bestowed on you.

1040
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:46,558
The wooden sword of freedom.

1041
02:01:50,125 --> 02:01:51,933
But you have to earn it first.

1042
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:55,225
Today, you're
going to defend your mother.

1043
02:02:13,458 --> 02:02:21,225
Would all steal a
point? There's still a point!

1044
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:49,183
Wait for me.

1045
02:03:04,916 --> 02:03:12,916
In honor of the
acclimation of Emperor Caracalla,

1046
02:03:15,125 --> 02:03:20,058
the first council, dondus
and second council, macronuts,

1047
02:03:20,416 --> 02:03:25,183
and as punishment for her
conspiracy against the empire,

1048
02:03:25,583 --> 02:03:29,850
for her calamities, against
the emperor's imperial bloodline,

1049
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,726
and for fermenting military mutiny.

1050
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:37,351
Along with her husband,
the queen will face divine justice

1051
02:03:37,375 --> 02:03:40,891
at the hands of the praetorian guard.

1052
02:04:06,625 --> 02:04:12,558
I'm not a general,
but we are all soldiers.

1053
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:20,475
[And up until now, we have fought for
nothing more than another day's survival.]

1054
02:04:21,791 --> 02:04:22,808
What will you have us do?

1055
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:27,558
Well, you can return to yourselves
if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1056
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Or,

1057
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:33,058
you can join me

1058
02:04:33,125 --> 02:04:37,058
and fight for a
freedom far beyond these walls.

1059
02:04:37,583 --> 02:04:42,225
That once was a time when
honor meant something and road.

1060
02:04:44,708 --> 02:04:49,016
In this road, I no
longer believe that exists.

1061
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:51,683
We must find it.

1062
02:04:52,041 --> 02:04:59,641
And know this,
where death is, we are not.

1063
02:05:02,833 --> 02:05:06,558
Where we are, death is not.

1064
02:05:08,125 --> 02:05:10,641
By my sword.

1065
02:05:13,958 --> 02:05:14,958
Strength another!

1066
02:05:15,208 --> 02:05:16,208
Strength another!

1067
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:18,125
Strength another!

1068
02:05:18,666 --> 02:05:19,683
Strength another!

1069
02:05:37,125 --> 02:05:38,266
Get up, guys!

1070
02:05:38,333 --> 02:05:46,333
Let it not be said that
the Emperor is not merciful.

1071
02:05:51,208 --> 02:05:55,476
The Queen will be
granted a single gladiator

1072
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:59,516
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1073
02:06:07,125 --> 02:06:12,058
The champion, Hano!

1074
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:20,708
The Queen will be
granted a single gladiator

1075
02:07:32,125 --> 02:07:32,267
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1076
02:07:32,291 --> 02:07:34,600
Summon the
cavalry. Put this down at once.

1077
02:07:35,125 --> 02:07:38,016
This is war! Real war!

1078
02:07:41,625 --> 02:07:47,183
The army of Arces is
advancing just outside of Rome, sir.

1079
02:07:49,125 --> 02:07:52,975
We can still out-flank them.
They have only 5,000 troops. No more.

1080
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:55,516
How many are we?

1081
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:57,850
6,000, perhaps more.

1082
02:07:58,291 --> 02:07:59,531
Ride to the gate and hold them.

1083
02:08:06,125 --> 02:08:14,125
They are barfing fire at their

1084
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:52,266
Go, please, go!

1085
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,500
Delicious.

1086
02:09:09,416 --> 02:09:10,416
Gimme the bowl.

1087
02:09:34,791 --> 02:09:35,791
Go, my son.

1088
02:09:36,125 --> 02:09:37,125
Losers.

1089
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:39,291
Pause.

1090
02:11:12,083 --> 02:11:14,100
Will nothing kill this barbarian?

1091
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:16,475
Name is Lucius Ferris Aurelius.

1092
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:19,392
The man does not
become emperor by bloodline alone.

1093
02:11:19,416 --> 02:11:22,601
He must be taken by
force and kept by force.

1094
02:11:22,625 --> 02:11:23,850
Are you such a man as this?

1095
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:25,350
I don't fight for power.

1096
02:11:26,291 --> 02:11:28,601
I fight to free Rome from men like you

1097
02:11:28,625 --> 02:11:29,891
and to return it to them.

1098
02:11:30,208 --> 02:11:32,975
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

1099
02:11:33,125 --> 02:11:35,766
They sent me to fulfill that task.

1100
02:11:36,083 --> 02:11:39,641
And what if your
gods sent me here to kill you?

1101
02:11:40,875 --> 02:11:43,683
It's time to end this, Maconess.

1102
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:54,766
Strengthen on her, myself.

1103
02:14:28,958 --> 02:14:30,475
You look to me to speak.

1104
02:14:33,208 --> 02:14:36,600
I know not what to say other
than we have all known too much death.

1105
02:14:38,166 --> 02:14:41,016
Let no more blood be
spilled in the name of tyranny.

1106
02:14:45,541 --> 02:14:51,433
My grandfather Marcus Aurelius
talked of the dream that would be roamed.

1107
02:14:52,083 --> 02:14:58,933
A dream that my father,
Maximus Decimus Meridius, died for.

1108
02:15:01,041 --> 02:15:02,041
An ideal.

1109
02:15:05,208 --> 02:15:08,850
A city for the many
and a refuge for those in need.

1110
02:15:09,541 --> 02:15:11,516
A home worth fighting for.

1111
02:15:13,125 --> 02:15:17,100
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1112
02:15:19,708 --> 02:15:21,016
That dream is lost.

1113
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:27,309
But dare we...

1114
02:15:27,333 --> 02:15:28,516
dare we...

1115
02:15:30,458 --> 02:15:32,891
rebuild that dream together?

1116
02:15:45,083 --> 02:15:46,141
What say you?

1117
02:15:53,333 --> 02:15:54,333
Hey!

1118
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:57,058
Hey!

1119
02:15:58,083 --> 02:15:59,083
Hey!

1120
02:16:03,375 --> 02:16:04,017
Hey!

1121
02:16:04,041 --> 02:16:05,041
Hey!

1122
02:16:10,375 --> 02:16:18,375
Mother.

1123
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:03,641
Speak to me, Father.
