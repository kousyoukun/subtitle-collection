320

My boy could pitch for the Majors!

321
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,759
(LAUGHS) But I would never do that
because it wouldn't be fair.

322
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
Anyway, I couldn't have done it without
the help of my closest friends.

Don't mind Bat, Superman.

325
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,759
He's probably thinking up sneaky new
ways to destroy you with Kryptonite

326
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,559
or defeat the rest of us in battle.

like, the millionth time this week.

Actually, Green Lantern,

329
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,799
I was thinking that we need to figure out
the trajectory of Brainiac's retreat.

330
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,759
Best to be prepared
when he decides to make a return visit.

331
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,439
Return? After a spanking like that?

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,639

we'll never see that freak again.

Er, maybe he's just passing by.

Aw, his new ride is so tiny and cute.

336
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,319
Not a problem, I'll deal with it.

337
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,399
Despite our quick victory last time,
Brainiac is a formidable foe.

338
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,479
I think we should come up
with a game plan.

339

Yeah, okay.

340

Um, Green Lantern,
do you wanna come too?

- Absolutely!

344
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,839

Maybe Davy Jones will teach you
not to steal what I've rightfully stolen.

798
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,719
Now, out on the plank with ye.

799
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,806
There's an old friend waiting
to make your acquaintance. (LAUGHING)

800
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,439
Hal, you may not believe it now,

801
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,599
but I know that you
are the most fearless man alive.

802
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,959
Be that man.

803
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,959
Stow your scuttlebutt, matey.

804
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,803
It's into the sea with ye.

805
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,125
I believe in you, Hal.

806
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,159
(LAUGHING)

807
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,679
Har, har.

808
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,806
Huh.

809
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,319
What in the blue blazes?

810
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,803
Wrong, Captain Fear,
not blue blazes, green.

811
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,771
In brightest day, in blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

812
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,450
Let those who worship evil's might,
beware my power, Green Lantern's light.

813
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,728
Fire on that swabby, he's bewitched.

814
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,999
I'm not your swabby anymore, Captain,

815
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,048
and I don't take orders from Fear.

816
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,121
(SCREAMING)

817
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,319
What? Not cool, bro.

- (SCREAMING)
- Dude!

819
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:47,248
Shiver me timbers.
Tis the day Captain Fear feared the most.

820
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,239
Bet you're expecting me
to admit I was wrong about you

821
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,199
just because you said all
those nice words back there.

822
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,441
I said what I thought
might get the job done.

823
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,799
I was right.

824
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,529
And, when are you not?

825
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,199
Uh, Batman,
I am starting to turn invisible.

826
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,039
That's time repairing itself.

827
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,679
You're being sent back to our proper time.

828
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,079
- Well, Batman, what about you?
- I'll be fine.

829
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,242
Go, help the others against Brainiac.

If I were you, I'd start swimming.

833
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,759
My finny friend is nearby
and I think he wants to say hello.

(GASPING)

835
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,039
Swim away, argh, swim away!

836
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,119
Faster!

837
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,439
(PANTING)

00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,519
Ooh, you don't look so good.

839
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,119
Flying fish stole
my chicken leg, need energy.

840
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,451
This should help.

841
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,959
You have your own vitamin drink?

842
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,679
Crime never dries up, but heroes can.

843
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,519
That's why I developed
my own vitamin supplement.

844
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,479
Drink up, Flash.

845
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,959
And let's go save Superman.

Whoa!

848
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,559
Wow, Batman, this stuff is amazing.
I never felt so alive.

849
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,199
Do you have another can? I'd love
another can. Can I get another can?

850
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,759
I feel like I can take on the world.

Cookies, candies, dynamite... (GROANING)

858
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,363
Brainiac's drones will be destroyed

- I got this.
- What? What?

860
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,239
- You got this.
- Who? Who?

861
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,519
- We got this.
- Woohoo!

862
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,359
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

863
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,691
Ah, youth.

864
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,650
- (LAUGHING)

(He)', gang. Miss me?

866
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,919
Hal, Batman saved you too.

867
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,039
Well, I helped, but, yeah.

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,121
<i>Batman.</i>

869
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,719
So, Batman found a way to retrieve Wonder
Woman and Green Lantern.

870
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,245
This stinks.

871
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,439
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

872
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,719
How are the repairs
to my ship progressing?

873
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,999
It's nice to see you too.

874
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,039
I didn't mean to be rude, Brainiac 1.3,
but I am in the middle of something.

875
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,959
Oh, he's in the middle of something.

876
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,159
Maybe we're in the middle
of something too.

877
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,239
Your ship is 83% complete.

878
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,719
Bring it as soon as it's ready.

879
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,131

880
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,839
(SCOFFS) Brainiacs.

881
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,448
Let's see how these heroes
deal with a blast from the past.

882
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,760
Oh, what now?

883
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,719
Maybe Brainiac is sending
a message that he's giving up.

884
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,291
Or he's opening a portal
in time to return the others.

885
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,439
- (ROARING)
- Or that.

886
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,639
Do you have a cheer for
attacking blood-thirsty dinosaurs

887
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,641
that are about to eat us?

888
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,724
Whoa!

00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,647
(GRUNTING)

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,486

- Hold on, Flash.

(GRUNTING)

897

We're losing temporal displacement energy.

898
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,599
Time is snapping the Batmobile
to its proper place.

899
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,959
- Batman!
- Don't worry about me, Flash.

900
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,359
Help the others.

901
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,599
<i>Hmm.</i>

902
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,559

SUPERMAN: (SYNTHESIZED VOICE)
Welcome to the future, Batman.

<i>Do not thank goodness, it is an illusion.</i>

<i>Thank Brainiac. Don't you just
love the upgrades he gave me?</i>

(GASPING) No.

traveling through time to rescue me,</i>

911
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,519
<i>which means future Brainiac
also became aware of your plans.</i>

912

<i>So, he sent me to destroy you on arrival.</i>

913

<i>It's so funny how this
time travel stuff works, isn't it?</i>

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,279
You'll get used to the sewage smell
after a few weeks.

954
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,839
According to historical data...

955
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,359
Brainiac was unable to defeat
Superman in your time,

956
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,559
so he hurled Superman into a future where
Brainiac could develop the technology

957
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,839
to assimilate him and turn him
into the ultimate weapon.

958
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,319
Could you please not read my mind?

959
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,039
And stop finishing my sentences for once.

960
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,359
I never read your mind, okay?

961
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,719
It's always just obvious
what you're going to say next.

962
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,769
History also tells us
that you and Superman were good friends.

963
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,079
Maybe we can use your special
knowledge of Superman to free him.

964
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,719
Then, together, we can rise up
and defeat Brainiac.

965
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,399
- Yeah!
- Yeah, what do you say?

966
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,439
I've been preparing
for this day for a long time.

967
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,559
There's only one way
to stop Brainiac-Superman,

968
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,239
but to do it, I'll need
to get to the Batcave in Gotham City.

969
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,399
Are you crazy?

970
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,719
The streets are patrolled
by Brainiac's killer robots,

971
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,799
you'd be destroyed the minute
you left our hideout.

972
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,919
And not to mention Brainiac-Superman.

973
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,843
Oh, that is a good idea, Batman.

974
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,999
Sorry, he was wondering
if Wayne Enterprises

975
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,639
had ever constructed a tunnel
from Metropolis to Gotham.

976
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,479
As a matter of fact, it did. (CHUCKLING)

977
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,679
Brainiac has sensors everywhere.

978
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,879
If you're on the move, he'll know
and he'll send Brainiac-Superman.

979
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,690
Then I'll have to hope
someone slows him down.

980
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,039

01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,759
where indeed?

1108
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,439
(LAUGHING)

01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,441
(COMPUTER SPEAKING)

1110
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,806
Ah, finally.

1111
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,039
Greetings, Brainiac.

1112
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,599
(SNICKERING)

1113
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:57,439
Brainiac 1.2, Brainiac 1.3,
you are .0761 seconds late.

1114
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,199
I just finished cataloging
everything on the Earth,

1115
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,879
I am ready to shrink.

1116
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,279
Well, we have a surprise
for you, Brainiac.

1117
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,439
The Shrink-ray 2.0.

1118
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,354
You will notice, it
is even superior to...

1119
01:04:08,355 --> 01:04:09,759
My calculations indicate

1120
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,799
that I will, no doubt,
find it is a booby trap

1121
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,599
designed to destroy me when I activate it.

1122
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,239
You are quite correct and...
Wait, what?

1123
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,359
Apparently, his calculations
were better than ours.

1124
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,719
Of course, I am Brainiac 1.1.

1125
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,769
Whatever you calculate,
I calculate it first.

1126
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,999
It was his calculation.

1127
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,445
I calculated you would say that.

1128
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,279
All the other Brainiacs
now advance two numbers in rank.

1129
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,999
That should be good for morale.

1130
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,799
Now, back to work.

1131
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,929
Booby trap deactivated, amateurs.

1132
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,246
Now, I have the power.

1133
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,679
Well, there's gotta be a way to go back
to the future and save Batman, right?

1134
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,839
Batman wants us to save
the Earth from Brainiac first.

1135
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,839
We'll have to figure out a way
to save Batman, later.

1136

(GASPING)

1137
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,439
Oh, no, he didn't.

1138
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,521
I think he did.

1139
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,364
Ah, mission accomplished.

1140
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
(GROANING)

1141
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,639
Look, up in the sky.

1142
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,759
- It's massive.
- It's scary.

1143
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,279
No, it's... It's...

1144
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,566
It's a bottle.

1145
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,719
Thank Hera.

1146
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,519
- You're back.
- Batman.

1147
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,119
Brainiac has already won,
we've been bottled.

1148
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,199
But, how did you get here?

1149
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,399
Time sphere.

1150
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,279
The Legion has only one that wasn't
destroyed when Brainiac took over.

1151
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,930
It had just enough power to...

1152
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,599
- But, Brainiac-Superman...
- Thought he destroyed the Legion.

1153
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,719
But it was all an illusion
projected into your mind by Saturn Girl.

1154
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,439
Now, let's get uncorked and un-shrunk.

1155
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,999
Even with our combined strength,

1156
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,519
we're gonna need more power
to move that big cork.

1157
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,124
I think I have just the thing.

1158
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,079
Nice work, Cyborg. These jets are swell.

1159
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,599
Thanks, I'll build one more
when Supergirl gets her pilot's license.

1160
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,879
- Seriously?
- We'll see.

1161
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,239
Aw.

1162
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,879
All right, team, let's all
concentrate our firepower in one area.

1163
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,961
Follow my lead.

1164
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:18,719
Wait for it, wait for it...
Mega batarangs away.

1165
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,279
Sonic screeches on maximum.

1166
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,805
Heat vision activated.

1167
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,166
Energy stars.

1168
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,399
Lantern lasers.

1169
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,765
Speed force lightning.

1170
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,641
It's working!

1171
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,279
Huh, uncorked, one of my world's is no
longer in its original packaging.

1172
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,521
This must be the work
of the Justice League.

1173
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,559
They will pay.

1174
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,159
We got a bogey, 12 o'clock.

1175
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,519
It's noon already?

1176
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,959
Yeah, no wonder I'm starving.

1177
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,839
No, Supergirl, Brainiac, he's right there.

1178
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,479
Very clever.

1179
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,039
Let us see how clever you are
once I shrinkify you into non-existence.

01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,201

- Argh! Argh!
- CYBORG: In your face-ive maneuvers.

1183
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,119
- Hmm.
- We've got to figure out a way

1184
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,839
to turn off his shrink-ray.

1185
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,519
I have an idea, but it means
you have to keep him distracted.

1186
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,885
Consider it done, Batman.

1187
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,723
All right, team,

Never.

01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,291

Easy, Brainiac.

So, instead of shrinking us, you grew us.

- Seven...

- You say that all you need to do...

is fulfill your programing to collect?

01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,922
I must collect them all.

1267
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:24,239
So, in order to keep his self-destruct
programing at bay, he's collecting coins?

1268
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,799
What happens when he gets them all?

1269
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,279
Impossible.

1270
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:32,199
They mint new coins every year,
so his collection can never end.

1271
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,039
Ingenious!

1272
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,719
Batman, I wanna say thank you
for saving us.

1273
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,199
And I'm really sorry for saying that we
were merely work friends.

1274
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,399
It's obvious by the way you were
able to snap us out of our amnesia

1275
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,279
that you know a lot about us,

1276
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,999
as only a true friend would.

1277
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,082
Thank you for being our friend.

1278
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,199
You're welcome.

1279
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,399
And now I have something to say.

1280
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,919
- This team is in sore need of discipline.
- (ALL GASPING)

1281
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,439
The next threat to Earth
is going to find us prepared.

1282
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,679
Why?

1283
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,923
Because of this new training
exercise I devised called...

1284
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,719
Hide-and-seek.

1285
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,767
Not it.

1286
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,521
Not it.

1287
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,239
Wait, what?

1288
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,287
You're it.

1289
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,759
Oh, man, I'm it, again?

1290
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,119
Huh.

1291
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:32,759
100, 99, 98, 97, 96,

1292
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,919
95... You know, I'm starting at 50.

1293
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,127
50, 49...
