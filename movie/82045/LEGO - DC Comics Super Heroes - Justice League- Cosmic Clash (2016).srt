1266
01:14:20,197 --> 01:14:23,952
So, in order to keep his self-destruct
programing at bay, he's collecting coins?

1267
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,537
What happens when he gets them all?

1268
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,080
Impossible.

1269
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:31,585
They mint new coins every year,
so his collection can never end.

1270
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:34,094
Ingenious!

1271
01:14:35,087 --> 01:14:38,261
Batman, I wanna say thank you
for saving us.

1272
01:14:38,758 --> 01:14:41,602
And I'm really sorry for saying that we
were merely work friends.

1273
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:45,268
It's obvious by the way you were
able to snap us out of our amnesia

1274
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:46,774
that you know a lot about us,

1275
01:14:47,308 --> 01:14:49,310
as only a true friend would.

1276
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,113
Thank you for being our friend.

1277
01:14:54,774 --> 01:14:55,775
You're welcome.

1278
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:57,951
And now I have something to say.

1279
01:14:58,444 --> 01:15:01,698
This team is in sore need of discipline.
[ALL GASPING]

1280
01:15:01,948 --> 01:15:04,292
The next threat to Earth
is going to find us prepared.

1281
01:15:04,492 --> 01:15:05,493
Why?

1282
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,955
Because of this new training
exercise I devised called...

1283
01:15:10,122 --> 01:15:11,419
Hide-and-seek.

1284
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:12,796
Not it.

1285
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:16,553
Not it.

1286
01:15:17,964 --> 01:15:19,011
Wait, what?

1287
01:15:19,256 --> 01:15:20,303
You're it.

1288
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:24,391
Oh, man, I'm it, again?

1289
01:15:24,804 --> 01:15:25,851
Huh.

1290
01:15:26,138 --> 01:15:32,612
100, 99, 98, 97, 96,

1291
01:15:32,812 --> 01:15:35,736
95... You know, I'm starting at 50.

1292
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,159
50, 49...

1293
01:15:40,056 --> 01:15:46,319
