would it?

191
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,915
Let's hear it for life.

192
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,583
Ok, give me a boo!

193
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,584
Give me a hoo!

194
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,587
Give me a boo hoo hoo!

195
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,555
Beat death!

196
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:44,790
Yay!

197
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,492
Thank you, members
of the pep team.

198
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,761
Sex kills.

199
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,928
Sex kills.

200
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,229
Back, Malvert, back!

201
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,532
Do you want people
to be suspicious of you?

202
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,438
Look at those two
sneaking off.

203
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,542
Boy: Maybe they have to go
to the bathroom or something.

204
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:14,119
We can't do it now.

205
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,521
My mother
found my diaphragm.

206
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,521
What?

207
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,423
I'll get
some protection.

208
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,758
I'll get foam
and rubbers.

209
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,560
Don't start
without me.

210
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,180
[heavy breathing]

211
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,621
Breather: Yoo-hoo.
Anybody home?

212
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,790
Joe, what's that?

213
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,393
I'm gonna give you
horse head.

214
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,494
You're not Joe!

215
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,130
Aah!

216
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,645
Joe: Oh, you started
without me.

217
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,713
Bertha?

218
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,613
[heavy breathing]

219
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:17,683
Bertha?

220
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,918
Oh! [gasps]

221
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,488
Oh, Mrs. Smith,
I'm Mrs. Hummers.

222
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,524
Julie was baby-sitting
at my house when she got it.

223
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,193
Now I wanted you to have
the money I owed her.

224
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:32,231
It's all there.
5 hours at 65 cents an hour.

225
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,899
Oh, and I also included
Julie 's car fare--

226
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,534
one way, of course.

227
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:39,204
So, I mean, it's not
your fault, you know?

228
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,839
I've been trying to tell you
that all this time.

229
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,709
Don't worry.
Oh, look. There's Joe.

230
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:45,710
Joe!

231
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,513
This is not
very funny!

232
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,615
Joe, this is not
my idea of a joke,

233
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,118
and--and you're acting
in very bad taste!

234
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:56,988
Aah!

235
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,329
Oh, Hardy,
have you been

236
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,396
fooling around with
my bicycle seat again?

237
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,666
No.

238
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,737
What did you hit now?

239
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,904
Damn dog again.

240
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:16,074
Where are you?!
Where are you?!

241
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,175
What do you think
you're doin'?

242
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,311
Hey, man,
that's my parking space.

243
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,979
Can't you see I 'm
blind?

244
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,314
Hey, I 'm more
handicapped than you.

245
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,549
I can't even make love
to a woman!

246
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,050
I can never find one!
Now move it.

247
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,252
Hey, that's
our parking spot.

248
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,555
Great physical beauty
can be a handicap, too.

249
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,555
Who could have
done these murders?

250
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:34,159
I don't know.
It could have been anybody.

251
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,961
Well, it can't
be anybody.

252
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,496
It's gotta be
somebody.

253
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,930
Well, of course,
it's somebody.

254
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,632
But that somebody
could be anybody.

255
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,367
Well, look,
we didn't do it, right?

256
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,069
Right.

257
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,069
So you can't say

258
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,971
it could be anybody.
We're anybody.

259
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,774
True. But
we're also somebody.

260
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,941
Whoever the killer is

261
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,543
couldn't have chosen
a worse day.

262
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,046
In any case, we must
remember the 3 Ps :

263
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,548
No police,
no publicity, and, uh...

264
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,582
No pasta.

265
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,217
Don't let the pressure
get to you, Harlow.

266
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,520
That's
the third &quot;p.&quot;

267
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,954
I can't stand
the pressure.

268
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,255
You're
a brilliant educator.

269
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,392
You need some rest.

270
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,727
[bell rings]

271
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:15,867
Class, today we will learn
how to make...

272
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,068
a horse head bookend.

273
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,435
[class groans]

274
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:21,004
Perhaps man's highest
cultural achievement

275
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,608
is the horse head bookend.

276
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,543
With rape...

277
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,813
and violence...

278
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,015
rampant in this land.

279
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,151
With human flesh
cheap and...

280
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,654
and vulgarized,

281
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,123
one of the last bastions
of decency

282
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,893
is the gentle satisfaction
one gains

283
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,230
from making
a horse head bookend.

284
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:47,766
Just a minute, son.

285
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,734
Me, sir?

286
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:53,639
Yeah, yeah, the one
in the bed sheets.

287
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,841
Take that tambourine
off your head.

288
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,043
You belong to this school?

289
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,043
Yes, sir.

290
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,846
My name is Mawamba.

291
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,647
Is that a fact?

292
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,050
Do you know the school year
began in September?

293
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,584
This is
the last day in June.

294
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:09,388
I'm a bussing student,
sir, from the zowie.

295
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,789
The zowie?
That near Philadelphia?

296
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,792
It's in Africa, sir.
That's why I 'm late.

297
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:16,928
My bus just got in.

298
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,763
Do you know
anything about...

299
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:19,898
horse head bookends?

300
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,799
No, sir.

301
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,768
Good.

302
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,403
Now we only have
one day to work with you

303
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,439
'cause it's
the last day of school.

304
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,674
Now you're gonna make
horse heads, jungle boy.

305
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:33,078
You're gonna have horse heads
coming out of your ears.

306
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,346
Now one more question.

307
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,482
Would you mind
telling me...

308
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,283
how come you're not
in your neighborhood school?

309
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,985
It's a court order.

310
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,955
A court order, huh?
A court order?

311
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,658
Now that the right people
have taken over this country,

312
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,194
you're gonna see
some real court orders.

313
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,129
Now sit down
and make horse heads.

314
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,331
Now, remember, class...

315
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,533
You won't believe
what I saw over there.

316
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,801
What?

317
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,902
Don't ask.

318
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,904
Look--look at this.

319
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,306
Where did you get that?

320
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,708
I found it where Joe 
and bertha were murdered.

321
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,910
They shouldn't have been
doing that at a funeral.

322
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,579
Talking?

323
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,748
During horse head bookends?

324
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:11,850
Who was that?

325
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,887
Sure, the girl.

326
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,023
What have we here, Miss...

327
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,326
&quot;Shouldn't be
in the class anyway&quot;?

328
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,063
Well, it's a horse head
bookend, Mr. Duncan.

329
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,932
You stained it
and everything.

330
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,633
Yes, sir.

331
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,937
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

332
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,872
That's what I was thinking.

333
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,244
Don't mind us, girls.

334
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,812
We prom queen candidates
have to get changed

335
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,745
for the parade.

336
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,915
Hey, how come I 
have to break my ass

337
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:44,917
playing volleyball

338
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,551
while you get
all dolled up?

339
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,386
'cause I 'm beautiful
and you're hideous.

340
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,588
Oh, yeah? Someday,
you'll be old and ugly.

341
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,889
Oh, no, I won't.
Take a look at this.

342
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,725
I have these saved up

343
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,458
for the very first sign
of wrinkles.

344
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,761
What is it,
vitamin E?

345
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:00,632
Cyanide capsules.
Death before disfigurement.

346
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,967
You're sick.

347
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,301
Girl: Has anybody
seen Toby?

348
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,436
She's in big trouble.

349
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,537
She was found
with a weapon, and...

350
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,905
Breather:
Ha. I love locker rooms.

351
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,274
I love girls' locker rooms.

352
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,243
I love sweat.

353
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,112
I love girls' sweat.
[heavy breathing]

354
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,414
what's the matter
with you guys?

355
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,649
I don't know what's
the matter with them,

356
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,783
but I 'm nervous about
becoming prom queen.

357
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:20,585
Breather: queens.

358
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:21,919
Hey, you
haven't won yet.

359
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,921
Well, listen, darling,
with a figure like this...

360
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,256
Breather:
Nice figure.

361
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:26,391
...that's French.

362
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,994
French. French.
I like French.

363
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,262
[heavy breathing]
Skin.

364
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:34,765
[breathing faster]

365
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,069
Boobs! Boobs!

366
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,936
Very fun.

367
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,206

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,387
a top man who has
treated many murderers

550
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,054
before they killed.
I feel strongly

551
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,324
that the proper
course of action

552
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,092
is a thorough psychiatric
consultation. Ok?

553
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:30,795
No.

554
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:30,795
I don't think so.

555
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,798
Good. Then it's settled.

556
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,400
Good-bye, and thanks
for your confidence

557
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,334
in me, Mr. Peters.

558
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,803
It's not really
confidence, my dear.

559
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,139
I think you're crazy.

560
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,449
Now let's examine
the evidence again.

561
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:54,619
Now, here are
the murder weapons.

562
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,521
Now, who would logically
have access to them?

563
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:58,956
One paperclip.

564
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:01,259
Harlow,
that's yours.

565
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,963
3 trash bags. Now who
could these belong to?

566
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,298
What's he doing?

567
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,633
This used
to be the rest room

568
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,835
before they remodeled
the building,

569
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,637
and Malvert thinks
it's still here.

570
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,870
I keep a trash can
over there

571
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,973
for just this purpose.

572
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,841
Better to be safe
than sorry.

573
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,844
Of course, the man
deserves some respect.

574
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,679
He was a teacher
before the accident.

575
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,846
What accident?

576
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,482
Oh, he was in
a terrible crash,

577
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,149
he got rammed
from both the front

578
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,952
and the back
at the same time.

579
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,520
Poor fellow
got whiplash

580
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,554
in both directions.

581
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:33,057
Poor soul. Once
a teacher, now a janitor.

582
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,826
He does enjoy
the raise in pay.

583
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:38,596
Malvert afford hookers.

584
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,596
All done?

585
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,566
No. [urinates]

586
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,601
Now done.

587
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,672
You can't get
angry with him.

588
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,473
He gets teased
unmercifully.

589
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:50,874
Wait a minute.

590
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:54,111
Now, he
could be our man.

591
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:55,713
Look at him.
Look at him!

592
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,481
He's got blood
on his hands.

593
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,883
No. Since accident,

594
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,919
Malvert 
sometimes pee red.

595
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,454
You know
good urologist?

596
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,621
[telephone rings]

597
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,424
I'll get it. I'm
farthest from the phone.

598
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,860
Miss Mumsley :
That makes sense.

599
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,728
[ring]

600
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:15,600
[spring breaks]

601
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:15,600
[ring]

602
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,533
Hello.

603
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,137
Hello! I won't
beat around the bush.

604
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,039
I killed everybody,
and I 'm glad! Heh heh!

605
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:24,908
I appreciate
your honesty.

606
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,909
What makes your voice
sound so funny?

607
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,712
I'm disguising it,
schmuck.

608
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:29,780
How?

609
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:29,780
By talking through

610
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,915
a rubber chicken.

611
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,783
I thought it sounded
like you were

612
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,185
speaking through
a rubber chicken.

613
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,053
Listen, I 'm going to kill
next at the football game.

614
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,856
Click!

615
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,856
Did you hang up?

616
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:39,890
No. I just said click.

617
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,059
[dial tone]

618
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:42,993
Well,
who was that?

619
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,861
The killer--
chicken lips.

620
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,263
And if that
was the killer,

621
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,831
then Malvert 
can't be guilty.

622
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:48,932
You can go,
Malvert.

623
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:52,703
Damn. Malvert
never get picked!

624
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:53,904
[bell rings]

625
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:55,639
I've never been
to a shrink before.

626
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:56,607
What do I say?

627
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,875
Tell him anything
he wants to hear.

628
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,042
I don't know
what to tell.

629
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:00,110
Just don't let him
give you a lobotomy

630
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,178
like they did
to Jack Nicholson

631
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,179
in<i> Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

632
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,448
No,
I don't think so.

633
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,649
That would really
mess you up. Don't worry.

634
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:06,816
I'm scared.

635
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:07,952
It's routine.

636
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,454
[sniffles] I 'm sorry.

637
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,889
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

638
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,092
That's ok. It's
all right to cry.

639
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,894
Perhaps
this will help.

640
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,096
I'm sorry
I'm out of Kleenex.

641
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,964
Thank you, Dr. Sigmund.

642
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:22,966
Don't be so formal.

643
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,969
Call me Pischer.

644
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,972
Toby,
I'm going to ask you

645
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,007
a difficult
question.

646
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,109
Are you up for it?

647
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:34,212
I--I think so,
Dr. Sigmund.

648
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,980
Please,
don't be so formal.

649
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,316
Call me daddy.

650
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:43,020
Daddy? Wouldn't that
be unusual?

651
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,122
Not really, Toby.

652
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:47,125
You see, some day
I hope to be famous,

653
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:52,963
a father image
to the disturbed.

654
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:54,532
All I need is one...

655
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,933
[heavy breathing]

656
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,002
Sensational case.

657
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,806
Multiple personality,
perhaps.

658
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,975
Proof that reincarnation
does exist, perhaps.

659
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:08,913
The devil
as a patient, perhaps.

660
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,815
Perhaps...

661
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,150
perhaps...

662
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,120
perhaps...perhaps...

663
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,422
perhaps.

664
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:25,696
Somebody's been
using my office.

665
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,266
[heavy breathing]

666
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,034
Tell me, Toby...

667
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:33,771
how do you feel
about sex?

668
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,039
What?

669
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,940
Did I pronounce it
right?

670
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,542
Well...

671
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:41,045
You mean between
a man and a woman.

672
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,081
Yes. Or the species
of your choice.

673
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,183
Well...

674
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:48,686
well, I think that--

675
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,588
that sex can be
a beautiful thing

676
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,559
if 2 people
are in love and--

677
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,693
and are married

678
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,963
and can share and
care for one another.

679
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:01,064
Uh-huh.

680
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:04,335
2 souls
blending into one.

681
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,538
2 hot bodies pressed
 against each other's flesh!

682
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,439
Stop!

683
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,874
But at the same time,

684
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:13,076
it can be so ugly and--

685
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:15,913
and dirty and disgusting.

686
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,515
Yuck. My father--

687
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,982
Your father's name
was yuck?

688
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:21,385
Tell me
about your father.

689
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,786
Did you like yuck?

690
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,988
Oh, no. I hated him.

691
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,124
When I was a child,

692
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:30,160
he used to beat me
and lock me in my room

693
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,229
with him in it!

694
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,263
Don't call me
daddy anymore.

695
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,232
Well, he--

696
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,067
he told me
that sex was bad

697
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:38,936
and--and dirty and--

698
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:39,970
and your mother?

699
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,305
What did
she tell you?

700
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,241
She also told me that
sex was bad and dirty,

701
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,176
but only with my father.

702
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,913
With everyone else,
she said it was great.

703
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,414
[sobbing]

704
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,420
Thank you.

705
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,256
Your fellow students
who were murdered,

706
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:03,126
they had sex,
didn't they, Toby?

707
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:06,063
Yes, but I 
tried to warn them.

708
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,264
But the police say

709
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,232
you may be involved
in these murders.

710
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:12,134
Why would I kill
my best friends?

711
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:14,138
Listen, you've
gotta believe me!

712
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:18,142
I believe you, Toby.
But sometimes

713
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,310
the mind plays
strange tricks.

714
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,145
We do things
and afterwards

715
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:24,348
we don't remember
doing them.

716
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,517
[pipe clunks]
We become forgetful.

717
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,218
Did you know
that forgetfulness

718
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:30,420
was classified as
a mental illness?

719
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,791
I didn't do anything
I wasn't aware of.

720
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,159
[bell rings]

721
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,727
And--and I don't
feel so well now,

722
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,997
and I 'd like to return
to class, please.

723
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,598
Of course.
We'll continue

724
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,735
some other time.
Good-bye, Sybil,

725
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:45,803
Uh, eve.

726
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,438
Toby.

727
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,438
Toby.

728
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:52,143
Today, we will discuss
shakespeare's<i> Hamlet.</i>

729
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,243
Who was Hamlet?

730
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:54,312
His dog.

731
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:54,312
His dog?

732
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,246
Wasn't he
a Great Dane?

733
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,249
[students laugh]

734
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,249
Class!

735
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:01,518
In all my years
of teaching,

736
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:04,421
that is the stupidest answer
I have ever heard.

737
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:08,325
Go back
to grammar school.

738
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:10,060
I know where it is.
I'll show you.

739
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,830
Whoa!

740
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,830
Ok, ok.

741
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,598
Be careful! Hey, where's
your seeing eye dog?

742
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:17,201
Sorry, man. He stole
my car and everything.

743
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,236
My legs, my legs!

744
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,837
<i>Hamlet</i> is one
of shakespeare's

745
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:24,908
greatest tragedies.
It is the story of a prince,

746
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,912
the prince of Denmark,
a melancholy man

747
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,913
whose mother is
sleeping with his uncle.

748
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,316
I can relate
to that.

749
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,051
And how does he
solve this problem?

750
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,555
Students: Murder!

751
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,358
Sorry I 'm late.

752
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:42,526
Take your seat, please.

753
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,327
Peters on P.A.:
Attention, students.

754
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:47,231
As principal, I am
obligated to report

755
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,300
that Toby Badger
has just come

756
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,235
from a psychiatric session
with Dr. Sigmund.

757
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,337
While Dr. Sigmund
has not reached

758
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,806
any formal conclusion,
he does however feel

759
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,976
there is strong evidence
that Toby may indeed

760
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,946
be the psychotic killer
we've been all looking for.

761
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,415
But until this is confirmed
at a later date,

762
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,384
please treat her just like
any other student.

763
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,355
Murderer!

764
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,355
Bye, killer.

765
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,729
There, there, Harlow.
Don't fret.

766
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:22,366
You do have
a lot on your mind.

767
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,968
A lot on my mind?
The big day,

768
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:26,269
the big game,
the big parade,

769
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,837
6 big deaths--

770
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,540
you'd call that
a lot on my mind?

771
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,742
Here, speak
to the student bodies.

772
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:35,079
You know how you like
having your voice amplified.

773
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:37,648
Good afternoon, students.

774
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,285
This is Mr. Peters,
your principal.

775
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,855
I have some good news
and some bad news.

776
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,425
The good news is the killer
has definitely been identified

777
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,926
as a psychotic individual

778
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,529
suffering from
paranoiac schizophrenia.

779
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,298
He is armed and dangerous.

780
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,466
The bad news is
we have no idea who it is.

781
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,302
If anyone should
come across an individual

782
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,038
matching this description,

783
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,539
please call me at once,

784
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,507
but don't do it
in front of him.

785
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,310
And remember,
the big football game...

786
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,312
Mr. Malvert,
I wanted to talk to you.

787
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,314
If for some reason
suspicion should fall

788
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,582
on our dear Mr. Peters,

789
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,417
we would like you
to confess.

790
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,683
Well, Mr. Peters

791
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:16,553
is a valuable asset
to society,

792
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:18,321
while you are mere scum.

793
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,157
What difference
would jail make to you?

794
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,625
You'll have fun
with the boys.

795
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,594
Women don't
like you much now.

796
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,629
I certainly don't.

797
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,332
Homosexuality is
the up-and-coming thing.

798
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:31,469
[band playing]

799
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,673
Call again.

800
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,774
Mine.

801
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,848
[blows whistle]

802
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,385
[crowd cheering]

803
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,891
All right! Come on!

804
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,600
Man, wheels, how'd you
get such great seats?

805
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,935
The 50-yard line.

806
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,238
Yeah, I used my influence.
Give me the money.

807
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,906
Oh, yeah, yeah.

808
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,509
[band playing]

809
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,147
[crowd cheering]

810
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,093
Red hots! Hot dogs!
Peanuts!

811
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,394
Give me a hot dog.

812
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,395
Here's your hot dog.
You want mustard?

813
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:34,965
Yeah, give me some--

814
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,533
How about
something to drink?

815
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,535
Yeah, gi--
[gulps]

816
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,637
Hot dog.

817
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,637
Hot dog!

818
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:43,407
Here's your hot dog.
Here's your hot dog.

819
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,475
Here, you want
mustard, too?

820
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:46,544
Here you are.

821
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,513
Peanuts!

822
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,815
Here.

823
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,284
I'm gonna buy you
a hot dog.

824
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,986
Then you'll
like Malvert.

825
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,555
Hot dog!

826
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:02,726
Malvert: Slut! Slut!

827
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,464
All women alike!
All women with Malvert.

828
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,978
I still think
the boys are being killed

829
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,380
and then stuffed
in the trash bags.

830
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,248
Not necessarily.
It's a well-known fact

831
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,818
that if you put a male
inside a 3-ply hefty bag,

832
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,152
tightly tied at the top,

833
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,287
they'll suffocate
in a matter of minutes.

834
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:32,422
You can believe me.

835
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:33,557
That's how
they were murdered.

836
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,026
You're on. Hey, chief,
get over here.

837
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,230
Yes, sir?

838
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,231
Get in the bag.

839
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:42,232
Why?

840
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,234
Because
I told you so.

841
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,567
Yes, sir.

842
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,471
Oof!

843
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,641
[blows whistle]

844
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,511
[blows whistle]

845
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:05,556
[thumping]

846
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:12,696
I'm bad.
That's right. I'm bad.

847
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,464
Hey, blood. Hey, bro.
What's happenin'?

848
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:17,634
Hey, blood. Whoo!

849
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:19,870
[crowd cheering]

850
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,873
Try to get out.

851
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,651
[whistle blows]

852
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,668
All right.

853
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,536
Come on!

854
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:56,674
This is boring.
The game sucks anyway.

855
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:13,056
Excuse me. I have
to make a phone call.

856
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,192
I got a phone
right here.

857
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,794
I feel like grabbing
a quick shave.

858
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,931
Oh? I used
to be a barber.

859
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,566
I just remembered
I must pick up my daughter

860
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,834
at the airport.

861
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,569
Daddy, daddy,
the plane was early!

862
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,937
I'm back!

863
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,807
Come on. Everybody
will be watching the game.

864
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,722
Stop! Look
at all this crap!

865
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:48,492
Come on, baby.
Come on.

866
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,727
No. Al, let's stop.
It's cold.

867
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,529
All this garbage
is falling.

868
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,297
The garbage
gets me hot.

869
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:55,766
Ohh!

870
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:55,766
Ok, ok, stay here.

871
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,833
I'll get a blanket
and a broom.

872
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,369
Ok. Hurry, hurry.

873
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,305
I'm going.

874
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:03,707
Wrong time. Don't!

875
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,308
I'm just gonna
keep an eye on her.

876
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,310
Toby.

877
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:33,237

878
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,908

879
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:44,748
Heeeere's Breather!

880
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,349
Al? An eraser?!

881
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:47,351
Aah!

00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:58,127
Joan?

884
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:01,798
Al?

885
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:03,866
I saw you guys
come down here,

886
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,671
and I just don't think
is a very good idea.

887
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,705
[thud]

888
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,007
Ohh!

889
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:19,816
Joan, I 've got 'em.

890
00:45:19,816 --> 00:45:22,319
Best broom and blanket
money can buy.

891
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,689
Joan?

892
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:26,957
You look terrible.

893
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,924
What's
this white powder?

894
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,328
Ecch,
cut with chalk.

895
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,831
Joan?

896
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,799
No! No! No!

Referee: No touchdown.

Dead bodies on field.
15-yard penalty.

904
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,528
Take off.

905
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,431
[blows whistle]

906
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:10,367
All right, listen up now.

907
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,436
There's been
another double murder.

908
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,571
A killer is among us.

909
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,239
All you people
who have had

910
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,009
no previous duress
for criminal charges,

911
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,878
leave the stadium.

912
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:33,756
All those who have had
no motives

913
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:35,459
in connection
with this killing,

914
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,459
you can go home.

915
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:39,395
[crowd murmuring]

916
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,268
All right, now.

917
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,903
All those whose parents
are of the same sex,

918
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:48,238
you can go.

919
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,276
Damn. Question
was too obvious.

920
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:55,444
Sheriff: Well, hell,
we ain't got no suspect.

921
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,647
Peters: Where's Toby Badger?
Has anybody seen her?

922
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:58,982
Sheriff: No, not me.

923
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,351
She's been found on the scene
of all the crimes.

924
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,254
Sheriff: Well, sounds
like the killer to me.

925
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,422
Ok, I want
everyone deputized.

926
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:08,725
Spread out and
reconnoiter the area.

927
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,827
Any questions?
Yes, Dr. Sigmund.

928
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,496
Dr. Sigmund: Yes,
where did you learn

929
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,264
to speak English,
a zoo?

930
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,400
I understand this killer
strikes only those

931
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,303
who are having sex.

932
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,603
That could wipe out
the entire senior class.

933
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:21,738
Wait a minute!

934
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,038
No students leave
the school grounds

935
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,808
without filling out
the proper forms.

936
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,076
But they're dead.

937
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,310
Nurse: If we make
an exception for the dead,

938
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,113
we have to make
an exception for everyone!

939
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,182
I better get my forms.

940
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,519
[engine starts]

941
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:43,725
[siren]

942
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:44,794
Damn it, son.

943
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:47,029
We've been here
for 2 hours now,

944
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,899
and we're not
letting you go anywhere

945
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,468
until you tell us
where the murderess is

946
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,037
of these 2 young bodies.

947
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,038
Now, tell me, boy,

948
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,210
have you ever seen
a dead body? Huh?

949
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,815
Well, now,
has anybody in this room

950
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,117
ever seen a dead body?

951
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:20,096
Now talk, boy.

952
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:21,964
I'm not a suspect,

953
00:48:21,964 --> 00:48:23,566
and you can't keep me
here any longer,

954
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:27,403
and if you had any decency,
you'd remove these bodies.

955
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:29,640
[farts]

956
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,977
There's something
in the air.

957
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,112
Ok. Who had beans
for lunch?

958
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,078
Who did it?

959
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,078
He did.

960
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,415
Peters:
But he's dead.

961
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,616
Nurse:
It's a well-known fact

962
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,151
that corpses
can pass wind,

963
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:44,988
urinate,
have erections.

964
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,589
There's an old
Welsh saying--

965
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,326
&quot;Dead men tell no tales,
but they fart.&quot;

966
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,994
this investigation's
going nowhere.

967
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,629
I'm getting
out of here.

968
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,897
[ring]

969
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,232
That was
a high-pitched one.

970
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,800
That was
the phone.

971
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,801
Hello.

972
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:58,935
Hello again.

973
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,770
Chicken lips again.

974
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,673
Put him on
the speakerphone.

975
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,008
I will kill next
at the prom.

976
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,444
Oh, yeah? Click.

977
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,812
Did you hang up?

978
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,647
No. I just said click.

979
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,016
Ha ha. I got him.

980
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:15,986
[farts]

981
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,154
Eww! God!

982
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,959
Coach:
Don't you leave town.

983
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:24,261
[whispering]
Toby.

984
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,661
Toby.

985
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:26,997
Toby, wake up.

986
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,231
I didn't do it.

987
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,734
Toby, it's me,
Hardy.

988
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:33,703
Hardy, where am I?

989
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:35,038
[sniffs]

990
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:37,107
Cleveland?

991
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:40,109
Ugh!

992
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,612
Oh, Hardy, it was
so awful under there.

993
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,813
The worst is over.

994
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:44,881
[farts]

995
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:45,982
Toby: Aah!

996
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,018
[crash]

997
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:50,353
Hardy, you saved me.

998
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:52,656
That's Ok.
You owe me one.

999
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,068
What is all this?

1000
00:50:06,068 --> 00:50:08,071
It's from
the junior class play.

1001
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,073
They're doing a nonmusical
version of<i> Grease.</i>

1002
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,074
They couldn't get
the rights to the music.

1003
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:14,077
I'm gonna have
to get you out of here.

1004
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,111
No, I have
to go to the prom

1005
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:16,546
and find the killer.

1006
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,214
But you can't do that.
They'll grab you.

1007
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,685
It's the only way
to save my name.

1008
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,488
How are you going
to get past the entrance?

1009
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,990
I--I 'll have my hand
stamped or something.

1010
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,058
I mean
they'll recognize you.

1011
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,994
Besides, wouldn't that
be counterproductive?

1012
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:34,264
I'll go in disguise.

1013
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,232
I--I need 2 balloons.

1014
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:39,101
Oh. I happen to have 2...

1015
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:41,104
in case I got lucky.

1016
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,009
Hardy, can you
please wait outside?

1017
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,478
I could wait here.

1018
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,547
Ahem. Outside.

1019
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,258
Breather: We have
temporarily lost our picture.

1020
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,094
Please stand by.

1021
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:06,629
Just kidding.

1022
00:51:06,629 --> 00:51:07,997
[heavy breathing]

1023
00:51:07,997 --> 00:51:09,265
Hello! It's me,
the Breather.

1024
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,272
You're probably
wondering who I am.

1025
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,274
Who could I be?

1026
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,945
Could I be
the innocent-looking Toby?

1027
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,280
Would you trust a girl
who looks like Prince Valiant

1028
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,282
in a plum sweater?

1029
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,018
Maybe I 'm Dr. Sigmund,

1030
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,019
a man who was
once arrested

1031
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:32,589
for corrupting the morals
of a hooker.

1032
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,226
Then there's Malvert,
with the I.Q. Of a handball

1033
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,728
and the personality
of a parking meter.

1034
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,396
Violated.

1035
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,498
Could I be the principal
Mr. Peters,

1036
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,301
a man who keeps cheese
in his underwear

1037
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,169
to attract mice?

1038
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,672
Let's not forget
Ms. Leclair--

1039
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,340
English teacher by day

1040
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,842
and English teacher
by night.

1041
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:54,744
Ah, Miss Mumsley.

1042
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:58,448
She eats 12 prunes a day
and nothing happens.

1043
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,185
Nurse Krud 
and Miss Van Dyke.

1044
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,920
What's in a name?

1045
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,188
Everything.

1046
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:08,858
Then there's Dumpkin,
a man who sleeps

1047
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:12,629
with his nuts between
horse head bookends.

1048
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:16,199
Toby! You look
so different.

1049
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,201
I put a wig on, and I--

1050
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,437
I put these balloons
up here.

1051
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,139
They look great.
Can you keep them?

1052
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,107
You can have them
when I 'm through.

1053
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:26,942
Now, listen,
I've been thinking.

1054
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,046
All the clues have to be
in Mr. Peters' office.

1055
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,047
What makes you
think that?

1056
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,214
Well, that's where

1057
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:33,482
they've been holding
the investigations

1058
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:35,218
and all the important
evidence.

1059
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,653
It's--it's
got to be there.

1060
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,386
That does
make sense to me.

1061
00:52:38,387 --> 00:52:42,057
Somehow I 've got
to get Mr. Peters' keys.

1062
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:43,660
Hey,
who is that chick?

1063
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,261
I don't know, but what
a great set of balloons.

1064
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:47,463
Ignore them.

1065
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:49,466
Come on,
stick close to me.

1066
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,202
Hardy, I can't go
to the prom with you.

1067
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:56,239
Everyone knows I 'm
the only friend you have.

1068
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,407
Hardy.

1069
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,243
Hardy,
you'll blow my cover.

1070
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,378
All right,
I'll go in alone,

1071
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,712
but I 'm gonna
keep my eye on you.

1072
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,249
Ok.

01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,682
[chuckles]
Where are you going?

1264
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:27,883
Behind
the men's room toilet.

1265
01:01:27,883 --> 01:01:29,551
Ha! You're crazy.

1266
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,153
I got the idea
from<i> Godfather I.</i>

1267
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:32,421
Wait here, and
don't open the door

1268
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:33,888
for anyone but me.

1269
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:36,358
That's an order,
soldier.

1270
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:38,161
[laughs]

1271
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,384
[rumbling]

1272
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,419
Scott?

1273
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,456
Scott?

1274
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:10,093
[rumbling growing louder]

1275
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:26,342
Aah!

1276
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,344
Who is it?

1277
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:30,680
[heavy breathing]

1278
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,915
Oh, it's you!
You brought me the crown.

1279
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,117
Oh, I 'm prom queen
after all.

1280
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:36,084
Aah!

1281
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:40,356
[machine gun fire,
explosions, sirens]

1282
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:51,299
[train bell ringing]

1283
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,968
[noises stop]

1284
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:54,236
All right, soldier.

1285
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:55,537
You countermanded
a direct order

1286
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:57,071
by leaving
that door open,

1287
01:02:57,072 --> 01:02:58,174
and as soon
as we're done here,

1288
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,009
you're gonna
police the whole area.

1289
01:03:00,842 --> 01:03:02,145
Scott: Patti?

1290
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,382
[singsong]
Just kidding.

1291
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:09,519
Look, another minute,
I'll have my clothes off,

1292
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,218
and, uh...

1293
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:12,854
we'll break the rules
together.

1294
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:14,356
And don't worry about it--

1295
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,392
one fully-tested safety,
government-issued,

1296
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,295
and I even
cleaned my weapon.

1297
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,198
Patti?

1298
01:03:25,267 --> 01:03:27,970
Patti, you finally
got your crown.

1299
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,805
Mother of god
and country,

1300
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:30,906
you're dead.

1301
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,843
Let's have one
for old times' sake.

1302
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,810
Bleah.

1303
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:37,479
Well, I won't
be needing this.

1304
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:40,482
[heavy breathing]

1305
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,218
Who is that?

1306
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:46,656
Who's there?

1307
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,490
Hey, I 'm trying
to get laid here.

1308
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,792
[heavy breathing]

1309
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:52,494
No!

1310
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:53,729
Aah!

1311
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:57,499
[rustling]

1312
01:03:57,499 --> 01:03:59,435
[heavy breathing]

1313
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:08,778
Aw, poor kids.

1314
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,580
They bought the farm.

1315
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,515
At least I 'm safe.

1316
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:15,016
[chain saw buzzing]

1317
01:04:15,016 --> 01:04:17,519
Feet, do your stuff!

1318
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,857
[heavy breathing]

1319
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,458
What are you doing?
What's up with the saw?

1320
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,461
Ohh, I get it.
I get it.

1321
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,031
You're the killer.

1322
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,465
[chain saw buzzes]

1323
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:33,335
Look, you've killed
10 people already.

1324
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:35,705
11 is the legal limit
in this state.

1325
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,274
Best thing you can do
is just unplug the chain saw

1326
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,308
and--and hand it over to me.

1327
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,543
[buzz]

1328
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:42,945
Keep it.

1329
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,780
What do you want,
my life?

1330
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,315
What would you
 do with it?

1331
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:49,118
Take my car.
It's a gorgeous k-car.

1332
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,553
I just washed it
an hour ago.

1333
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,821
I buy Japanese.

1334
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:54,923
[heavy breathing]

1335
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:58,361
Ooh, better idea.

1336
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,362
While you got
the buzz saw,

1337
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:01,897
I'll teach you how
to make horse head bookends

1338
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:02,999
for all your books.

1339
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,366
Ah, ptuh!

1340
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,901
Ah, you probably don't
have much time for reading,

1341
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:07,036
what with your schedule.

1342
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,504
Only smut.

1343
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:09,505
Please...

1344
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:12,508
from one sicko
to another,

1345
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,509
I'm begging you...

1346
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,511
[chuckles]

1347
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:17,613
[crying]
Mommy...

1348
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,513
mommy.

1349
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:24,553
[chain saw buzzing]

1350
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:30,359
Ah ah ah ah.

1351
01:05:33,595 --> 01:05:34,796
Not bad.

1352
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:36,098
Ahh.

1353
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:40,569
Were you gonna use that--
that on flesh?

1354
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,670
Uh-huh.

1355
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,105
Where's your rotary?

1356
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,440
That's for wood.

1357
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,675
Huh? Ahh!

1358
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,176
I can see
the heavy breathing,

1359
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:50,312
but shut off the buzz saw.

1360
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:51,580
[chain saw
shuts off]

1361
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,015
Good.

1362
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,051
Now, this is
what you gotta do.

1363
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,987
First, unplug
the buzz saw.

1364
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,723
Good.

1365
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:01,590
Now oil it
and clean it.

1366
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,026
[sprays oil]

1367
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,460
Wipe that grease off.

1368
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,696
Ahh!

1369
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,033
Good.

1370
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,101
Now put it back
in the case.

1371
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:16,038
[heavy
breathing]

1372
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,606
Put it back on the shelf
where it belongs.

1373
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:21,177
[thunk]

1374
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,714
Ha ha ha.

1375
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,118
[keys jingling]

1376
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:52,040
[balloons squeak]

1377
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,649
[rattling]

1378
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,638
[balloons squeak]

1379
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,309
Harlow, Harlow,
where are you going?

1380
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:02,444
I'm gonna check
my office.

1381
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:04,913
I think
I lost my keys

1382
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:06,715
and my cheese.

1383
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:20,496
[marbles rattling]

1384
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:50,426
Toby, thinking:
Harlot.

1385
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:51,927
Slut.

1386
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:52,760
Floozie.

1387
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,799
Bad girl.
Whore.

1388
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,832
Bimbo.

1389
01:08:57,832 --> 01:08:59,666
Toby.

1390
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,037
Oh.

1391
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,372
Oh, Mr. Peters.

1392
01:09:04,372 --> 01:09:05,841
You--
you startled me.

1393
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,576
I wouldn't
want to do that.

1394
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,211
Um...

1395
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,846
I wanted
to thank you

1396
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:11,779
for having
Dr. Sigmund, um,

1397
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:15,149
have those sessions
with me.

1398
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:16,518
It was very helpful.

1399
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:17,553
Oh?

1400
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,053
And that's why
you're here in my office?

1401
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:21,890
Yes!
Yes, that's right.

1402
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,658
Toby, I 'm curious.

1403
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:25,861
Did you expect to find me
in the filing cabinet?

1404
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,796
Oh. Oh, that.

1405
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,365
Oh, you mean these?

1406
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,800
Well, I was looking
at these pictures,

1407
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,438
and--and, well,
I couldn't wait

1408
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,906
for the yearbook
to come out.

1409
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:38,807
Is that so, Toby?

1410
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:42,676
No. Um...

1411
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:44,345
do you really want
to know the truth?

1412
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:46,348
Yes, Toby.
Tell me the truth.

1413
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,649
[sighs] Well--

1414
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:51,385
well, the truth is--
it's that--

1415
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:53,689
well, as you know,
everyone suspects me

1416
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,292
of having something
to do with the murders,

1417
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,692
like me
being the murderer.

1418
01:09:57,692 --> 01:10:00,495
And--and--and so
I was just thinking--

1419
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:02,698
Yes, go on, Toby.
What were you thinking?

1420
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,700
Well, to tell you
the truth,

1421
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,501
I didn't know
what to think.

1422
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:09,004
You're a bright girl, Toby.

1423
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,674
Surely you have some theory
developed by now.

1424
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:13,842
Well, yes,
as a matter of fact,

1425
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,845
I think that
the murderer knew

1426
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:22,084
all the victims.

1427
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:23,751
Yes, go on.

1428
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:27,923
And he must've had
access to the school...

1429
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,191
Good. Good.

1430
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,327
Because of
the murder weapons.

1431
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,231
Toby: Someone
who's immature

1432
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:37,566
and crazy and--

1433
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,135
and deranged and--

1434
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,503
and someone
who wanted to see

1435
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:44,873
harm come
to the students.

1436
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:45,941
Someone like--

1437
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,742
someone like
the principal.

1438
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:50,879
Yes, someone
like the principal.

1439
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,484
Mr. Peters!

1440
01:10:56,851 --> 01:10:58,853
You're naked!

1441
01:10:58,854 --> 01:10:59,855
Yes, Toby.

1442
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,924
All these years
I've been secretly naked

1443
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:02,824
underneath my clothes.

1444
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:05,160
But did anyone notice?
Any girls?

1445
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,760
Any prom queen candidates?

1446
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:07,663
No.

1447
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,464
All those lithesome
budding bodies

1448
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:12,401
changing from girlhood
to womanhood,

1449
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,402
like moths
into butterflies,

1450
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:16,671
year after year,
right before my eyes.

1451
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:19,041
Do you realize
how that affects a man?

1452
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:19,908
Um...
it makes you hot?

1453
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,812
That's right, Toby.

1454
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,281
It makes me...hot.

1455
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:28,483
Especially the naughty ones

1456
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:29,852
like Julie 
and Bertha and Joan

1457
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,553
and Dagmar.

1458
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:32,954
[heavy breathing]

1459
01:11:32,954 --> 01:11:35,090
Do you want to know why
I think they were murdered?

1460
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:35,924
No. Yes!

1461
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:38,426
Why?

1462
01:11:38,426 --> 01:11:39,894
Because they were naughty.

1463
01:11:39,894 --> 01:11:40,929
Naughty?

1464
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,798
Disgustingly naughty.

1465
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:47,001
Each and every one of them
was caught doing...sex.

1466
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,170
Sex? Yuck!

1467
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,806
That's right, Toby.
Yecch.

1468
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,007
Sex is dirty
and sex is bad.

1469
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:56,009
Yes. Yes, I agree.
I--

1470
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,045
well, I don't know.

1471
01:11:57,045 --> 01:11:58,680
I've never
really done it.

1472
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,014
But you would
like to do it,

1473
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:01,016
wouldn't you?

1474
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:03,652
Yes. No! No.

1475
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,788
Excuse me a moment.
I'll be right back.

1476
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:07,955
What--what are you
going to do?

1477
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:13,028
Have you ever seen
our school trophy, Toby?

1478
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,396
No, I--

1479
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,465
I never knew
we ever won a trophy.

1480
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,832
Oh, we did.

1481
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:21,737
In 20 years,
we only won one trophy.

1482
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:26,041
Ahh, the typing team
really came through that year.

1483
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,508
Typing team?

1484
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:29,311
We retired the typewriter,

1485
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,346
but we kept the trophy.

1486
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:33,882
I'll be back.

1487
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,918
[door closes]

1488
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,290
[ringing]

1489
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,858
Hello?
Hello, um--

1490
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:46,728
Listen, I 'm in
terrible danger

1491
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:48,330
and I need
some help.

1492
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,398
Recording: You have
reached the police.

1493
01:12:50,398 --> 01:12:52,066
We are closed.

1494
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,867
Look out behind you!

1495
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:56,004
[gasps]

1496
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,138
I'm back again.

1497
01:12:57,138 --> 01:12:58,006
Look.
Look behind you.

1498
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,911
You're not going to fool me
with that old trick.

1499
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,080
See? I was right.

1500
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,251
This is our trophy, Toby.

1501
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,018
Look!

1502
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:12,855
No!

1503
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,857
[bell clanking]

1504
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:37,278
Miss Mumsley : Well,
she's not in the men's room.

1505
01:13:37,278 --> 01:13:38,346
Malvert:
When we catch her,

1506
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:39,915
can Malvert 
kill her first, ok?

1507
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:43,051
Ok, but I get
first crack at her.

1508
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,153
[voices arguing]

1509
01:13:45,153 --> 01:13:46,554
Dr. Sigmund:
hello, all.

1510
01:13:46,554 --> 01:13:48,923
Dr. Sigmund,
what are you doing here?

1511
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:50,392
And what's
that hideous creature

1512
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,626
at the end
of the leash?

1513
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:53,862
I tamper with
nature as a hobby.

1514
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,997
I crossed a flounder
with a walrus

1515
01:13:55,997 --> 01:13:57,032
and a horny toad.

1516
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,533
What did you get?

1517
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,134
A fish with warts
and a mustache

1518
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:01,203
that can't
get a date.

1519
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,239
It really belongs
in a zoo.

1520
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,273
Thanks,
but they refused it.

1521
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:07,075
Well, good night.

1522
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:10,078
She's got to be
here someplace.

1523
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:13,080
I'll look
in the men's room.

1524
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,149
Malvert: Ok.

1525
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:16,918
Aah!

1526
01:14:16,918 --> 01:14:18,954
Ohh.

1527
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,156
Aah! Hardy!

1528
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:23,191
Hardy!

1529
01:14:23,191 --> 01:14:24,092
Hardy! Hardy!

1530
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:27,362
Hardy, I killed
Mr. Peters,

1531
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,331
and I think
he's a murderer,

1532
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,000
and everything's
so horrible!

1533
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,835
Hardy--

1534
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,003
Aaaah!

1535
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:37,038
Ohhh!

1536
01:14:37,038 --> 01:14:41,409
He's dead, my dear,
just like the others.

1537
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:43,478
I didn't have time
to bag him.

1538
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:45,180
Miss Mumsley!

1539
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,983
Yes, Miss Mumsley.

1540
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,453
Do you think
I look good in green?

1541
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,121
Why, yes, I think
it's quite flattering.

1542
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,758
Thank you.

1543
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,326
Too bad
you have to die.

1544
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,794
You're the only one
of the girls

1545
01:14:59,794 --> 01:15:01,730
who didn't
get laid first.

1546
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,196
Then you did it.

1547
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:05,033
I only kill
the boys.

1548
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,201
He killed the girls.

1549
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,335
It breaks up
the monotony.

1550
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,403
But why?

1551
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,705
Why not?
I never told him.

1552
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:10,838
He had no idea.

1553
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:12,441
I did it
to protect him

1554
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,409
in case there
were any witnesses.

1555
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,210
I don't understand.

1556
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,678
Because he was my son.

1557
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:19,214
You're his mother?!

1558
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,649
No, his father.

1559
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,583
Oh, my god!

1560
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,686
Father-mother.

1561
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,121
But why did you do it?

1562
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:29,124
Because I loved him.

1563
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:33,027
Listen,
please let me go and--

1564
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:35,363
and I won't tell anyone
you're crazy.

1565
01:15:35,363 --> 01:15:36,164
I swear!

1566
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,033
Hold still
while I kill you.

1567
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:41,236
I'm an old woman
with arthritis.

Ohh!

Toby: Patti and Scott,
you're all alive!

1590
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,102
You're all alive and--

1591
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:31,806
and you're who you are
in real life.

1592
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:34,107
Oh, Mr. Dumpkin,
I had this dream and--

1593
01:18:34,108 --> 01:18:36,044
and you weren't even
my French teacher!

1594
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:38,213
I will always be
your French teacher.

1595
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,982
But you were surrounded
by all these horse heads.

1596
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,216
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est,
 a horse head?</i>

1597
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:44,218
You must've had
a terrible dream, no?

1598
01:18:44,218 --> 01:18:46,454
A terrible dream?
It was a nightmare.

1599
01:18:46,454 --> 01:18:48,356
Oh, this swine flu
really affected my mind.

1600
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,360
I--I dreamt that all
my friends were murdered

1601
01:18:54,195 --> 01:18:55,862
because
they were having sex.

1602
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:58,232
Sounds reasonable.

1603
01:18:58,232 --> 01:19:00,235
Toby: Mr. Mumsley,
you were a woman.

1604
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:03,137
And Mr. Peters,
you were the principal and--

1605
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,106
it's all due
to sexual repression

1606
01:19:05,106 --> 01:19:06,840
and urban stress,
my dear.

1607
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:07,875
So who was the murderer?

1608
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,178
Luke, you can walk.

1609
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:12,146
Yeah, I have been
since I was 2 years old.

1610
01:19:12,146 --> 01:19:14,715
And Mr. Malvert,
you were a janitor.

1611
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:16,150
Absurd!

1612
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:19,219
No, really,
I was at this prom and--

1613
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,556
and there was
this weird red punch.

1614
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:24,759
Sometimes,
Peters pee red.

1615
01:19:24,759 --> 01:19:26,227
While you
were unconscious,

1616
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:29,964
we all felt so sorry
for you that, well,

1617
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:32,100
the gang voted you
prom queen.

1618
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,835
It was
Patti Priswell 's idea.

1619
01:19:34,835 --> 01:19:37,739
But, Patti,
all through my dream

1620
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,674
all you wanted
was the crown.

1621
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,777
It's all I wanted
in my dreams, too.

1622
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:44,245
Will you put these
in water for me?

1623
01:19:44,245 --> 01:19:45,279
Sure.

1624
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,283
In any event, people,
Toby needs her rest.

1625
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,452
We can all
visit her tomorrow.

1626
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,887
Don't forget your appointment
on Tuesday, my dear.

1627
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:55,257
Bye-bye.

1628
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:01,029
What was I like
in your dream?

1629
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,297
Well, besides me,

1630
01:20:03,297 --> 01:20:05,500
you were the only one
who was normal.

1631
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,169
Yeah.
Boring, isn't it?

1632
01:20:08,169 --> 01:20:09,603
Nope.

1633
01:20:09,603 --> 01:20:12,374
Boring gets me hot.

1634
01:20:21,315 --> 01:20:22,750
And I don't have
any more nightmares.

1635
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,985
Good.

1636
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,521
Dr. Sigmund told me
that sexual repression

1637
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,022
causes swine flu,

1638
01:20:28,022 --> 01:20:29,791
so I think it's time
for me to do it.

1639
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:32,860
Here? Now?

1640
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,830
Ok.

1641
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:50,945
All I ask is that
you just turn your back

1642
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:54,748
while I undress, ok?

1643
01:20:54,748 --> 01:20:56,617
Yes.

1644
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:02,424
And I 'll slip into
something more comfortable.

1645
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,870
[heavy breathing]

1646
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,208
Hardy.

1647
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:24,512
Hardy, what are you doing
with those rubber gloves on?

1648
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,550
Hardy, why are you
breathing so heavy?

1649
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,384
I'm the killer.

1650
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,119
Hardy, you're
not the killer.

1651
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,321
You're my friend,
remember?

1652
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:36,190
That was a dream.
This is reality.

1653
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,825
Why are you
doing this?

1654
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:39,393
I don't know.

1655
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:41,596
I guess I 'm just
that kind of guy!

1656
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,297
Aah! Aah!

1657
01:21:43,297 --> 01:21:44,299
Uhh!

1658
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,434
Hardy, no!

1659
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:51,105
I know it's unusual
for a psychiatrist

1660
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:53,007
to speak at a funeral,

1661
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:55,343
but this was my client.

1662
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,544
The latest victim,
Toby Badger,

1663
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,113
just laid to rest.

1664
01:21:59,113 --> 01:22:02,149
She suffered severe
social repression,

1665
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:03,551
countered by
an expressed nausea

1666
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,420
towards sex,

1667
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,056
which led to severe
social alienation

1668
01:22:09,056 --> 01:22:11,258
causing huge
psychological problems,

1669
01:22:11,258 --> 01:22:13,693
leading to the greatest
psychological problem

1670
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:14,562
of them all, death.

1671
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,598
Let us pay
our final respects,

1672
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:22,504
but the living must go on
and make a new beginning,

1673
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,507
hopefully in a spirit
of openness

1674
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:26,706
and sharing of grief,

1675
01:22:26,707 --> 01:22:29,544
individually
or in groups.

1676
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:33,080
I'm sorry I had
to kill you, Toby.

1677
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,651
You just shouldn't
have done it.

1678
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:38,353
I lost respect,

1679
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:41,456
but I do
still love you.

1680
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:45,927
Others have only
brought you one flower,

1681
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,530
but I 've brought you 2.

1682
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,563
And if we should
ever meet again--

1683
01:22:50,564 --> 01:22:51,900
Aah!

1684
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,201
[choking]
