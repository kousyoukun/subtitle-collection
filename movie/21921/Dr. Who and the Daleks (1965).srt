1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,375
(I Fanfare)

2
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,958
(I Theme music)

3
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,458
(Clock ticks)

4
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,750
(Sighs) Most exciting. Hm.

5
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,791
(Clock chimes)

6
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,916
Goodness, Ian will be here in a moment.
I must go and get ready.

7
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh? Who's that?

8
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,666
Grandfather!
I told you about him dozens of times.

9
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,500
- Her new boyfriend.
- Ooh!

10
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,666
Yes, I look forward to meeting him.
What's his name?

11
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,041
Ian.

12
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,083
Goodness, that'll be him now!

13
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,333
Susie, be a dear
and answer the door, will you?

14
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,791
All right.

15
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,083
(Whistles)

16
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,875
- Glad you dropped in.
- OK, so you caught me again.

17
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,458
Grandfather, this is Ian Chesterton.

18
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,375
- I am so very glad to meet you at last.
- Oh, hi.

19
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,250
- Oh, excuse me.
- How extremely kind of you.

20
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,458
Most thoughtful. Thank you.

21
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,583
They're for Barbara.
They're soft centres. Her favourite kind.

22
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,416
Oh, yes, of course, yes.
Well, she was here a moment ago.

23
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:50,166
Well, er, never mind. Why don't you
sit down while you're waiting for her?

24
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,583
- (Squelching)
- Oh...

25
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,833
Soft centres.

26
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,083
Well, never mind.

27
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,416
Plenty more where that came from.
(Laughs)

28
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,375
- (Gasps) No! Wait!
- What is it?

29
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,416
A super-ionised
electro-kinetic pre-oscillator.

30
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,083
And you nearly sat on it.

31
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,500
Years of research work.
Part of my new invention.

32
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,208
Would you like to see it?
Come on. Come on, I'll show you.

33
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,791
He wouldn't understand.

34
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,500
Anyone can understand science if they
only put their minds to it. You can.

35
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,625
Well, that's different.

36
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,833
- Oh, well, let's give Harold a chance.
- Ian.

37
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,875
- I beg your pardon?
- Yes, my name's Ian, Dr Who.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,333
Oh! How do you do?

39
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,958
Yes, yes, well, come along, then.
Come along.

40
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,833
Thank you, Susie.
Off we go. (Chuckles)

41
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,500
After you, erm... Yes, right.

42
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,333
There. My latest invention.

43
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,875
- What, a police box?
- Of course not!

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,416
- This is TARDIS.
- TARDIS?

45
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,958
It stands for Time And Relative
Dimension In Space.

46
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,708
- Oh.
- Go inside. Go on.

47
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,750
- Yeah?
- Mm.

48
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,625
(Beeping and whirring)

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,208
(Dr Who chuckles)

50
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,250
(Ian laughs nervously)

51
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
(Beeping and whirring)

52
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:46,416
But it's so big in here and yet
it's so small from outside. How come?

53
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,958
In electro-kinetic theory, space expands
to accommodate the time necessary

54
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,250
- to encompass its dimensions.
- My little fellow scientist.

55
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,416
We've been working on TARDIS
for many years.

56
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,166
This is the final component.

57
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,416
You are privileged, young man,
to be the first visitor

58
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,375
to our time and space machine.

59
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,916
There. I can now set the controls

60
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,541
for anywhere in time and space
that we wish to go.

61
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,541
When I push that lever,
this room and everything in it

62
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,833
will dissolve into their respective
component electrical charges.

63
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,333
We're all made up of them.

64
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,708
These charges
will then be transferred in time and space

65
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,500
and reassembled in their proper order
and their proper place.

66
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,666
Er, well, I think I ought to be, er...

67
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,250
Oh, I thought you'd all be in here.

68
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,208
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

69
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,625
(Whirring)

70
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,208
Young man,
do you know what you have just done?

71
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,708
You have transferred us in time and space
and I haven't even set the controls.

72
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,750
Now I don't know where we are.

73
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,583
We could be anywhere in the universe
and at any time!

74
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,916
Rather exciting, isn't it?

75
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,333
Look, I don't know how you do the magic
with the inside of this room,

76
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,375
but as far as being somewhere else
in the universe... (Laughs)

77
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,208
Let's see where we are.

78
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,083
(Beeping)

79
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,833
- Grandfather, where are we?
- Susan, dear, don't go too far yet.

80
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,458
There must have been a forest fire.

81
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,958
The heat must have been indescribable.

82
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,250
It's turned the earth into ashes.

83
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,625
Oh, well, the soil can't be that bad.
It still grows these shrubs and trees.

84
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,541
Look at that.

85
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,208
Ooh!

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,458
A petrified jungle!

87
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,375
How interesting.
This is most interesting.

88
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,916
Well, if it's all the same to you, sir,

89
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,666
perhaps we could be making
our way home now, huh?

90
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,041
What, and miss the chance of learning
something about an unknown planet?

91
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,875
Coward.
I for one am going to investigate.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,541
- (Dr Who chuckles)
- Come on, Grandfather.

93
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,458
- Come on, Grandfather!
- I'm coming, darling.

94
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,541
- Fascinating.
- Grandfather, look at this!

95
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166
(Chuckles) And what is it then?

96
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:56,000
Byfingo!
That looks like a... looks like a tulip.

97
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,333
It's a lilium philadelphicum.

98
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,750
Is it now? (Chuckles)

99
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,666
It's a lilium philadelphicum, is it? Hm.

100
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,625
(Barbara screams) Ian!

101
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,541
(Screams)

102
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,916
Oh! Oh!

103
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,041
Oh, Ian! Are you all right?

104
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,666
- Nothing broken, lad?
- No.

105
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,875
It was another soft centre.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,916
Well, come and sit over...
Look, over here.

107
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,166
There we are.

108
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,750
We shall never know what that was,
will we, Susie? (Chuckles)

109
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,000
Grandfather, look!

110
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,708
- What have you found this time?
- Look!

111
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,000
Upon my soul! A city!

112
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,583
But how extraordinary!

113
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,166
A huge city!

114
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,791
Can you see any people?

115
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,083
(Dr Who) No. No one at all.

116
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,375
No life, no movement.

117
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,875
Here.

118
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,083
- Can you see anyone?
- No.

119
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,958
- Let's investigate.
- Oh, yes, let's!

120
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,958
Something terrible happened here.

121
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,708
This place is dangerous.

122
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,666
I can feel it.

123
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,541
- I wish we could leave.
- Well, you don't have to convince me.

124
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,083
Er, Dr Who.

125
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,000
I think we should get out of this place.

126
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,416
But look, Susan's just found a city.

127
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,666
Wouldn't you like to explore it first?

128
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,416
Erm, well, they're expecting me at home.

129
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,083
They'll be wondering where I am.
I... I think we should go back.

130
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,666
Aww.

131
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,458
Oh, Well.

132
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,375
(Branches snap)

133
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
(Susan screams)

134
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,625
Hey, hey, hey! It's me, it's me, it's me!

135
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,166
(Beeping and whirring)

136
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,333
Are you sure, Susan, dear?

137
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,666
It's not possible for any human form
to exist on this planet.

138
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,250
It was a hand! It touched me!

139
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,500
Hm. Then I'd like to find out
who or what it was.

140
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,708
Rather you than me.

141
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,208
We don't know where we are,
what period in time.

142
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,500
- We don't know what might be out there.
- (Knocking)

143
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,000
The scanner.

144
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,583
(Buzzing)

145
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,041
(Barbara) Nobody. Not a thing.

146
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,791
Well, something
must have made that noise

147
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,333
and I don't want to find out what it is.

148
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,875
- Can't you set the controls for home?
- Certainly.

149
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,166
- All set.
- Well, you got us here.

150
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,375
You might as well get us back.

151
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,375
- (Pulsating buzzing)
- What's the matter?

152
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,333
There's something wrong somewhere.

153
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,333
I'll try the fault locator.

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,125
(Beeping)

155
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,916
K7. The fluid link section.

156
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,500
That's it. The fluid link.

157
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,708
This end has been
jarred out of position.

158
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,708
Some of the fluid has run out.

159
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,916
- Have you got a spare?
- Oh, we don't need one.

160
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,958
This just needs refilling with mercury.
I have some in my labora... tory.

161
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,375
Supposing there isn't any mercury
on this planet.

162
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll have to try the city. It's about
the only place we're likely to find any.

163
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,541
Be careful!

164
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,958
(Dr Who) Susan!
(Barbara) Susan!

165
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,750
Right. Thank you, Susie.

166
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,208
It looks like some sort of drug.
I wonder what it is.

167
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,250
So there was someone here.

168
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I shall make some tests on these
when we get home. Yes.

169
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,375
Now, perhaps you'll put those inside
for me, will you, Susan, dear?

170
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,375
And now...

171
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,541
for the city.

172
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,541
That was a steep climb, wasn't it, Susie?

173
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,125
- What's the matter?
- It's all right, dear.

174
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,500
Grandfather, are you all right?

175
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,375
Just a little tired.
My legs are rather weak.

176
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,708
I don't feel too well myself.

177
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,125
Must be the altitude.

178
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,666
Take a good, deep breath, lad.

179
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,541
That's better. Yes.

180
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:17,333
Now, in a city like this,
there must be laboratories.

181
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,208
Now, that's where we could find
some mercury.

182
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,416
Now, I suggest we all take different
directions and then all meet back here.

183
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,833
How's that? Yes? Right.

184
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,208
Now, you come along with me, Susie.

185
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,791
You take that one.

186
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,375
Having trouble, lad?

187
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,250
I can't get through those doors!

188
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,875
(Barbara screams)

189
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
Let's try the other way.

190
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,458
Susan, dear, you sit on there
while we try to keep those doors open.

191
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,541
When I shout, you run just as fast
as you can. Good girl.

192
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,875
Ready? Now, Susan! Run! Fast!

193
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,333
Not too fast, lad. Not too fast.

194
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,166
Come on, lad.

195
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,250
- Wait.
- What is it?

196
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,750
- Listen.
- (Beeping)

197
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,041
It's coming from over there.

198
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,750
(Beeping)

199
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,791
(Beeping and whirring)

200
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,708
Well!

201
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,541
Susan! Susan, dean

202
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,333
Measuring instruments.
But to measure what, I wonder?

203
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,291
This is some sort of Geiger counter.

204
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,375
And it is past the danger point.

205
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,916
The atmosphere is polluted
with a very high level of fallout.

206
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,000
Then we must find Barbara
and get back to TARDIS.

207
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,000
Even if we do,
we can't leave until we get some mercury.

208
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,791
Young man, I have to confess,

209
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,000
there is nothing wrong
with the fluid link.

210
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,458
I just didn't want to leave
until we had explored the city.

211
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,250
- Please forgive me.
- Well, let's get out of here.

212
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,166
You will move ahead of us

213
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,250
and follow directions.

214
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,750
This way.

215
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:44,125
He will recover shortly.

216
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,333
Search him.

217
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,208
That is of no value to you! It...

218
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,666
Come this way.

219
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,875
- Thank goodness, you've come!
- I'm so glad you're safe!

220
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,083
Ian! Ian, what happened to you?

221
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,708
- Oh, it's nothing.
- He'll be all right in a minute.

222
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,583
- Yeah.
- (Barbara gasps) Ian!

223
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:55,125
Don't worry. Don't worry, Barbara.
It is only a temporary shock.

224
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,125
Get him up over here. Up.

225
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,750
At least we're all together.
How do you feel?

226
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,708
Sort of weak and giddy.

227
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,166
- And Susan?
- I feel the same.

228
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:14,250
We found a Geiger counter upstairs.
This planet has a high level of radiation,

229
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,250
perhaps the result
of some lost atomic war.

230
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,208
All the time we were in the open,
we were exposed to it.

231
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,041
What's gonna happen to us,
Grandfather?

232
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,750
Unless we can get some treatment,
we have little hope of survival.

233
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:32,500
Our prisoners are showing signs
of radiation sickness.

234
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,041
But they have not yet perished from it.

235
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,416
They must have found something
that makes them immune

236
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:42,958
while we must remain
in these protective machines

237
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,375
and cannot go out of our city.

238
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,750
If we had it, we could leave the city,

239
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:53,208
destroy all others
and have the planet for ourselves.

240
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,625
Let us overhear what our prisoners say.

241
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,250
Perhaps they will give us the answer.

242
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:11,166
'If some form of life
does exist outside this city,

243
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,250
'they must have discovered
an anti-radiation drug.'

244
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,166
'Well?'

245
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:21,666
'That box of glass vials
we found outside TARDIS. Remember?'

246
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,833
One of you four

247
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:33,333
must go outside the city.

248
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,000
- Which will it be?
- Why?

249
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,208
Many centuries ago,

250
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,791
there were two peoples on this planet.

251
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,666
Ourselves, the Daleks, and the Thals.

252
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,166
After the neutronic war,

253
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:55,000
our forefathers retired into the city,

254
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,500
protected by this clothing.

255
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:01,875
Most of the Thals perished in the war.

256
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,666
Those who survived
and remain on this planet

257
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:09,541
are horrible mutations, monsters.

258
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:14,750
They have a drug
which cures the sickness of radiation.

259
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,125
If we get the drug,

260
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,916
we will give some to you.

261
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:23,583
Without it, you will die.

262
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,750
None of us is well enough to go.

263
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,791
One of you must.

264
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,666
I'll go.

265
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,375
- Susan!
- It's too dangerous.

266
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,208
Hurry.

267
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,041
(Lightning crackles)

268
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,250
(Thunder booms)

269
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,250
(Lightning crackles)

270
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,083
The young one is approaching the forest.

271
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,916
She will be there in a moment now.

272
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,916
If she returns with the drug,

273
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:23,166
am I to allow the prisoners to use some?

274
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,916
No. Their only value

275
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,916
is to bring us the drug

276
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,916
to duplicate for ourselves.

277
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,541
Let them die.

278
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,875
Oh, dear.

279
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,083
I'm so sorry.

280
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,291
It was all my fault.

281
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:48,958
Oh, clear, he's getting worse.
What does he mean, it's all his fault?

282
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,625
There was nothing wrong
with the fluid link.

283
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,166
And now the Daleks
have taken it from him.

284
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,666
(Barbara) What are we going to do?

285
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:01,916
Nothing we can do. Just wait.

286
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,625
Hope nothing happens to Susan.

287
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,833
(Lightning crackles, thunder booms)

288
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,500
(Lightning crackles)

289
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,166
(Branches snap)

290
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,583
Who's there?

291
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,708
Who's there?

292
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,416
(Thunder booms)

293
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,500
(Beeping and whirring)

294
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,250
(Door latch clicks)

295
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,000
Who are you? What do you want?

296
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:32,416
My name is Alydon. I am a Thal.

297
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,500
I tried to speak to you
in the forest just now.

298
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,666
I'm sorry I frightened you.

299
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,791
I came back to make sure
you knew how to use the drugs I left you.

300
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,500
But I found no one here.

301
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,291
The others are prisoners
of the Daleks in the city.

302
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:50,458
- There are people in the city?
- They sent me back for the drugs.

303
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:54,291
Do they want them for themselves
or for your friends?

304
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:57,958
I don't know. I don't trust them.

305
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:01,291
I shall give you a second supply

306
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:04,541
which you must hide as best you can.

307
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,791
Thank you. But I don't understand.

308
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,791
They said you were mutations.

309
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,750
There were many mutations
after the final war.

310
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,833
Most of them perished.

311
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:22,083
But this form, two hands, two eyes,
has always been best for survival.

312
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,250
But they called you monsters.

313
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:30,625
If they call us monsters,
what must they be like?

314
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,791
(Beeping)

315
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:52,000
Have you brought anything else
from your ship?

316
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,750
No.

317
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:01,541
(Susan screams)

318
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,458
You are hiding something.

319
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,916
Show it to me.

320
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:21,166
Give these other drugs to your friends.

321
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,791
- Here's yours, Barbara, dear.
- Thank you.

322
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:30,625
So, a Thal gave you this cape, Susan?

323
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,833
Yes. His name's Alydon.
He told me his people live far from here

324
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,458
but this year their crops were ruined
and they came here in search of food.

325
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,000
'He said his people would gladly
give the Daleks the formula for the drug

326
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,541
'if the Daleks
would give them food in return.'

327
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:50,958
We do not need their formula.

328
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:56,458
Now that the girl
has brought us the drug,

329
00:32:56,583 --> 00:33:00,041
we can make it ourselves.

330
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,000
We will rid ourselves

331
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:07,958
of these protective machines,

332
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:14,041
move beyond the limits of the city

333
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,083
and destroy the Thals.

334
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:21,250
No, there is a better way.

335
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,666
Let us offer them food,

336
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:28,125
bring them into the city.

337
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,125
- A trap?
- Yes.

338
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:36,125
Will they not suspect anything?

339
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,625
Not if the message
is written by their friend,

340
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,958
the young girl.

341
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,166
Ian!

342
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:57,750
I have brought you
more food and water.

343
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,583
- The small one is to come with me.
- What for?

344
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,750
You have the drug.
When are you going to set us free?

345
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,125
Stay!

346
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:21,458
We are going to help the Thals,

347
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:25,208
which is what you want us to do.

348
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,708
How do they know
we wanted to help the Thals?

349
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,625
Add this:

350
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,291
"The Daleks

351
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:53,333
"want only to help you

352
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,958
"and to be friends."

353
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,666
Now sign your name!

354
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,375
'(Dr Who) I've found it.

355
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,916
'Up there.

356
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,500
'That's how they know
what we're doing.'

357
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:19,791
All we wanted was this message.

358
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:25,541
When the Thals come
to collect the food,

359
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,541
we will destroy them.

360
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,291
What on earth are you two doing?

361
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:59,833
We'll be able to talk
without them seeing or hearing us.

362
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:03,083
- (Ian) Is it coming away?
- Yes.

363
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,750
(Ian) Right, pull hard.
I'll hold you. Agh!

364
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:12,500
Our prisoners are intelligent.

365
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:16,083
And perhaps dangerous.

366
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,250
Why not exterminate them?

367
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:23,458
They have been useful to us once.

368
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,041
They may be again.

369
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:31,541
First, let us exterminate the Thals.

370
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,625
Shall we replace the lens?

371
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,666
No need.

372
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:42,833
We have learned enough
from our prisoners.

373
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:49,250
And we have them
where they can do no harm.

374
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,750
They're bringing the Thals into a trap.

375
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,916
Isn't there anything we can do?

376
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:05,875
If we could find a weakness
in the Daleks, just one...

377
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,625
They are protected,
they can move easily

378
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,541
and they have weapons
which can paralyse or destroy.

379
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:16,916
- There is nothing we can do.
- Then the Thals are doomed.

380
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,791
Suppose the Daleks refuse to help us.

381
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,166
Then we shall have to start back
for our own country.

382
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:39,125
- Across the desert? Many of us will die.
- But if the Daleks have food,

383
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,083
- how can they refuse it to us?
- Look.

384
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,541
I found this at the gates of the city.

385
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,666
It is from the young girl.

386
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,458
She says that the Dalek people
wish to make friends with us.

387
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,041
Food will be left for us
in their great hall.

388
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:59,291
- We are to collect it tomorrow!
- (Excited chatter)

389
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,083
Stop! How do you know
you can trust the Daleks?

390
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,291
Their ancestors
waged a great war against us,

391
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,625
destroyed our planet,
caused all this devastation.

392
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,250
But that was long ago! Now they wish
to make friends with us, offer us food.

393
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,041
There's no reason
not to believe their good intentions.

394
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:18,750
We will go to the city of the Daleks
in the morning.

395
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,625
(Metal clanks)

396
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,833
(Metal clanks)

397
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,666
The doors, the walls, the floor

398
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,833
are all made of metal.

399
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,916
Perhaps this is the Daleks' weakness.

400
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,875
(Barbara) What do you mean?

401
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,750
Whenever they move,
there is a familiar odour.

402
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,625
(Barbara) I've noticed that.
I was trying to remember where...

403
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,708
A fairground. You get the same smell
from the dodgem cars.

404
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,041
It's ozone, made by electric sparks.

405
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:01,000
Electric power.
Not the sort of electricity we know,

406
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,250
but some form of static electricity.

407
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,250
Those armour suits they wear

408
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,625
are actually machines that pick up their
power through the metal of the floor.

409
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,250
Now, if we could insulate those machines
from their power source,

410
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,291
- they would be hopeless.
- Yes.

411
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,708
But what can we use as an insulator?

412
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:22,000
- My cape!
- Susan!

413
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,458
It's made of
some sort of plastic material.

414
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,416
It should be thick enough.

415
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:32,500
Sure. It's gonna be easy, isn't it?

416
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:36,333
"Excuse me, Mr Dalek,
would you care to move onto this cape?"

417
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,875
Move back from the door!

418
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,958
You, take the food.

419
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,083
They always stay outside in the corridor.

420
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,750
You can't get near them
without being seen.

421
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:05,750
Couldn't we smash that lens in their eye?
Or throw Susan's cape over it?

422
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:09,291
Then what do you use
to insulate him from the floor?

423
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,708
Hmm...

424
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,708
(Barbara) I think I've got it!

425
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,958
If he's on time,
he'll be here any second. All ready, lad?

426
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,583
Just a little farther away from the door,
Susan, dean

427
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,208
Too close will make him suspicious.

428
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,833
All ready, Barbara?

429
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,000
He's coming.

430
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,875
Take this.

431
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,000
It must last you till tomorrow.

432
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:14,583
What is happening?

433
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,625
Why do not the doors close?

434
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,083
- (Barbara) Dalek!
- Yes? Agh!

435
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,375
Help me! Help! Help me!

436
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,666
- Help me! Help!
- Here! Tie these!

437
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:32,666
Help me! Help!
Prisoners trying to escape!

438
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:35,833
Help me! Cannot see them!
Cannot see them!

439
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:38,041
Help! Cannot see them!

440
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,750
- Help! Help me! Quickly!
- (Barbara) Grandfather!

441
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,458
- (Ian) I've got him!
- They must not get away!

442
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,750
- (Ian gasps)
- Help me! Help me!

443
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:51,541
Help me! Help me!

444
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,916
It worked. Well done, everybody.

445
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,916
Do you think he's dead?

446
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,125
Now, you and Barbara
go and keep watch on the corridor.

447
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,250
Come along, lad.
Move it over to there.

448
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:10,291
Careful!
They could still be dangerous!

449
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,708
Pick up the cape.
How does this thing open?

450
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,916
Can you manage it?
Put it over there.

451
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,291
- Now what?
- Now you get inside.

452
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,375
- What for?
- Pretend you're a Dalek.

453
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,750
If we meet anyone,
you're taking us to be questioned.

454
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,708
- Yeah, but what if they find out?
- We'll be no worse off than we are now.

455
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:47,541
Come along, get inside, lad!
Speed is essential!

456
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,250
Hatch coming down.

457
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,833
- (Ian) Now I can't see anything.
- What?

458
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,583
- (Ian) I can't see anything.
- The eye.

459
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,916
(Ian) Hey, this thing's full of controls
in here. Should I try a few?

460
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,750
Oh, for heaven's sake, no,
don't touch a thing! We'll move you.

461
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,625
Ready, Barbara? Right, on with it.

462
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,916
Susan, show us the way the Daleks
took you when you went back to TARDIS.

463
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,750
All right.
Turn left at the end of the corridor.

464
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:49,291
This is the way I came.
There's a big door with a Dalek on guard.

465
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,750
Beyond the door is the lift.

466
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,083
Now it's up to you, lad. Courage.

467
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,291
- (Ian) Ow.
- Ooh, sorry.

468
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,708
Stop.

469
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,958
(Ian) The prisoners have been called
for questioning.

470
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:20,583
(Dalek) I have not been informed. Wait.

471
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,791
I won't go! I won't!

472
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:25,375
Halt her! Halt her!

473
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,083
Help me get them inside.

474
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:45,208
Shall I help you take them
to the fourth level?

475
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,625
(Ian) No. Close the doors.

476
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,375
That was clever of you, Susie!

477
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:11,500
I have just passed the prisoners
into shaft seven.

478
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,708
(Dalek over radio) 'Stand by.'

479
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,458
(Ian) Can you get me out of this thing?
It's hot in here.

480
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,125
Yep.

481
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:28,208
(Dalek over radio) 'There is
no movement order for the prisoners.

482
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,500
<i>'Hold them.'</i>

483
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,250
- (Ian) Hurry up and get me out of here!
- We're trying, lad!

484
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:43,916
The door is locked.

485
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:49,500
They must have fused it.
Emergency alarm!

486
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,416
- (Alarm bell rings)
- (Ian) What was that?

487
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:56,125
- An alarm bell! They know we've escaped!
- Try to push it up from the inside!

488
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,083
- (Ian) What do you think I've been doing?
- Well, try harder, lad!

489
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:21,416
They're cutting through the door!

490
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,625
The lift has stopped
just short of the floor.

491
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,708
We'll never get him in.
Let's try. (Groans)

492
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,416
(Ian) Leave me!
No sense in us all being captured.

493
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:49,291
(Barbara) No!
(Ian) Leave me!

494
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:52,541
(Barbara) No!
(Dr Who) One, two, three

495
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,625
- (Dr Who groans)
- (Barbara) Ian!

496
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,208
How long will it take
to cut through that door?

497
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,291
- Not very long.
- But even if he does get out,

498
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,875
he's stuck down there!
This is the only way of escape!

499
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,916
- Grandfather, we can't just leave him!
- What can we do?

500
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,000
Look!

501
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,125
Stop it! Stop it!

502
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,166
Bring it down!

503
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,833
- Oh, Ian!
- How did you manage it?

504
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,291
(Lift whirrs)

505
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,875
We must find a way out.

506
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,426
The Thals are coming
for their food supplies.

507
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,250
They're walking
straight into an ambush.

508
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:33,541
Our orders
are not to capture them.

509
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:39,583
They are to be
completely destroyed.

510
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,333
They must not escape.
They must die.

511
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,291
I understand.

512
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,250
(Susan) Hurry up!

513
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,958
Hey! Give me a hand!

514
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:07,541
(Ian) Now, one, two, three!

515
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,375
We must warn the Thals!

516
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,625
Help!

517
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:42,583
(Machines beep)

518
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,416
Got it!

519
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,916
It's a trap! Go back! Run!

520
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:54,250
(Dr Who pants)

521
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,916
Thank you for warning us.

522
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,666
I'm sorry... we were not in time
to save your friend.

523
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,291
But I don't understand why.

524
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:12,708
Why did they want to kill us?
We came in peace.

525
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,000
You are different from them,

526
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,500
and they are afraid
of anything different.

527
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:20,875
And what people are afraid of,
they try to destroy.

528
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,750
If we could reason with them...

529
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:26,166
They are beyond reason.
They wish only to conquer.

530
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:29,375
- What can we do, then?
- Why, fight them!

531
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,166
We're a peaceful people.
We see no reason to kill others.

532
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:38,375
But even when you know
that they would kill you?

533
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:43,875
The last war destroyed
almost everything on this planet,

534
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,208
left it... like this.

535
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:52,791
- We do not want another.
- That is understandable.

536
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:55,750
I wish there was some way
we could help you.

537
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,375
You must go.

538
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,291
We shall survive.

539
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:05,166
Good bye.

540
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:07,625
And good luck.

541
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,791
Madam.

542
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,833
Yes.

543
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:14,166
Come along, children.

544
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,916
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

545
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:41,416
The drug of the Thals
has been duplicated.

546
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:45,750
Good.
We will test it on this work section.

547
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:48,250
If it is effective,

548
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,250
we will discard these machines

549
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:55,041
and go out and destroy the Thals.

550
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,208
(Beeping)

551
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,791
- (Susan) Check.
- Check. Barbara?

552
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,333
Check.

553
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:09,000
(Pulsating buzzing)

554
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,916
Hm.

555
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,208
- Check.
- Check.

556
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:27,291
(Pulsating buzzing)

557
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,666
The fluid link!

558
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,125
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

559
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,291
- We must get it back.
- How?

560
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:43,791
Only the Thals can help us.

561
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:51,625
We'd like to help you.
You saved many of our people.

562
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,375
But we do not wish to kill others.

563
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,625
And I do not want
any of my people to be killed.

564
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,250
Supposing the Daleks
come out of their city and attack you?

565
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:12,583
They could find a way
of getting out of the city.

566
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:14,541
They have weapons, you have none.

567
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:16,875
We will not fight.

568
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,250
'Out of control.

569
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,875
'Help me. Help me.

570
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,041
'Out of control.'

571
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,291
This is the section
to whom we gave the drug.

572
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:33,541
It is obvious that we Daleks
cannot use the drug of the Thals.

573
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:36,583
We will not be able
to leave these machines

574
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,958
or go out of the city.

575
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:48,208
Then we will destroy the Thals
without leaving the city.

576
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,541
We will explode another neutron bomb

577
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:55,083
and increase radiation
throughout the planet

578
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,250
to a point where
even the drug of the Thals

579
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:01,833
will not be able
to protect them from it.

580
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:06,666
- When shall we explode the bomb?
- Immediately.

581
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:11,416
These writings contain a complete history
of our planet and our people.

582
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,833
Fascinating.
Absolutely fascinating.

583
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,041
But these writings go back
nearly half a million years.

584
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,458
There was a great civilisation here once.

585
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,625
Destroyed by the war.

586
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,833
But you can rebuild it, man. Now, surely
that is something worth fighting for.

587
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,083
Why do you keep these writings?

588
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,083
They're the history of our people.

589
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,375
A history that will end
with this generation

590
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,791
unless you are prepared
to fight for its survival.

591
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,875
One of your people
was killed in the city.

592
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,625
Many others could have been killed
and will be unless you take action.

593
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,875
We will not fight.

594
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,416
(Woman giggles)

595
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,208
Lad.

596
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,541
Young man.

597
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,916
Do you know
why the Daleks held us as prisoners?

598
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,750
They wanted to experiment on us.

599
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,500
Perhaps if we gave them
one of your people instead,

600
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:20,375
they might return the piece of equipment
they took from me.

601
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:26,375
- Take her to the Daleks.
- You can't...

602
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,833
You cannot do this!

603
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:44,875
- I thought you were our friends!
- You see? You will fight for something.

604
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:07,375
The neutron bomb will be ready
for explosion in one hour.

605
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,083
Good.

606
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,500
In one hour,

607
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:19,166
we will be sole masters of this planet.

608
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:27,166
(Thal) The city is surrounded
on three sides by rock walls.

609
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,083
The fourth side is protected

610
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:32,750
by mountains and a deadly swamp.

611
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,250
Deadly?

612
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:39,541
Five of us
went looking for food there one day.

613
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,666
Only my brother and I came back.

614
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:46,250
- (Dr Who) What happened to the others?
- We found them. What was left of them.

615
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:51,458
The swamp is alive with mutations.
It's a perfect defence for the city.

616
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:54,625
If we could get through that way,
we could take the Daleks by surprise.

617
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,958
It'll be too dangerous for all of us.

618
00:58:57,083 --> 00:59:01,625
But we'll send a small party that way,
led by our brave friend.

619
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:05,666
The rest will come with us
to try to find a way to approach the city.

620
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:09,458
You will go with him
through the swamp.

621
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:11,208
Hey!

622
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,416
All right.

623
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:19,125
What have you to report?

624
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:23,666
Our long-range scanners
detect movement by the Thals.

625
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:27,625
A large party
is approaching the city walls.

626
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:31,916
Bring defence plan seven into operation.

627
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,750
Alert all sections.

628
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:38,250
Another group is moving
towards the rear of the city.

629
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:43,125
They cannot pass. They will die.

630
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,833
- We'll never get through!
- We must try.

631
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,318
- It's full of mutations!
- You keep your fears to yourself!

632
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,000
I don't want you upsetting the others.

633
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,583
Right, come on!

634
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:22,916
(Barbara) Oh, can't we rest
just a minute?

635
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:25,000
All right, rest.

636
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,916
Oh, I could do with a wash.

637
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,083
Hey! Hey!

638
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:51,500
- I saw a great big thing in the water!
- What was it?

639
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,416
I don't know.
I didn't wait to find out.

640
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:56,166
- Are you all right?
- Look!

641
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,375
The Daleks
must get their water from here.

642
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,125
The pipes must go
straight through the mountain,

643
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,250
perhaps into the city of the Daleks.

644
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:09,083
If we could find that way...

645
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:12,166
I'll fill the water bags.
We'll need them. I'll catch you up.

646
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,916
Right, come on!

647
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,375
- (Barbara) Oh!
- Help! Get me out!

648
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,375
Get me out!

649
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,958
- (Screaming)
- Stay with her.

650
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,208
You, come with me.

651
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,333
What's happened to Elyon?
Where is he?

652
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,208
Let's get out of here.

653
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,250
Come on!

654
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:28,166
The Daleks have the entire city
surrounded with electronic instruments.

655
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:31,833
Now, to get past the walls of the city,
we must find a way of approaching them

656
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,250
- without being detected.
- But you're a man of science.

657
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,083
Surely you can think of a way.

658
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:39,500
Yes, yes,
but it's not all that easy, young man.

659
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,208
Well, we're lucky
they don't go underground.

660
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,375
We can follow them
straight over the mountain.

661
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,666
- How are we going to do that?
- We'll climb.

662
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,750
Climb?

663
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,958
I was only thinking about Barbara.

664
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,333
Come on!

665
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:17,083
This is the final battle.

666
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:22,000
When we explode the neutron bomb,

667
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:26,083
there will be more radiation

668
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:28,916
on this planet

669
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:33,166
than even the Thals with their drug

670
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:35,375
can survive.

671
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:39,875
(All) Destroy the Thals!

672
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,458
Tonight we will complete the war

673
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:48,875
which our ancestors should have won

674
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,916
many centuries ago.

675
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:56,375
(All) Destroy the Thals!

676
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,958
(Barbara) Do you think
we're almost there yet?

677
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:11,708
(Thal) I don't know.
All we can do is follow the pipes.

678
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:15,750
We must be
over the worst of it by now, huh?

679
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,500
Right, come on.

680
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,375
Ganatus.

681
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,625
- I...
- Yes?

682
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,958
- I want to go back.
- We must get to the city!

683
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,000
They could have scanners here.
I'm going back.

684
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,791
- No, you're not!
- We'll be killed! We won't defeat them!

685
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:57,083
(Cracking)

686
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,708
What have you been doing?

687
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,250
Now there can be no question
of going back!

688
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,583
Grandfather!
I told you to watch the cakes!

689
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:29,000
- Now you've burnt them!
- Oh, yes, the cakes. The cakes!

690
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:37,750
Madam!

691
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:44,708
Pardon me, please.
May I borrow that just for a moment?

692
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,083
Thank you so much.

693
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:48,500
Young man, do you have
any more of these mirrors?

694
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,250
- Why, yes.
- Get them, please.

695
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,833
- Collect as many as you can.
- Why?

696
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:55,000
They may be our way
of getting into the city.

697
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,375
- Ooh!
- (Barbara screams)

698
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,291
Here.

699
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,458
- What are you going to do?
- Jump it.

700
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,791
We'll use this as a safety line.

701
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,958
I'll go first.

702
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,916
Now you.

703
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,250
I think I need a longer run.

704
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,708
Don't worry, it's easy.

705
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,833
Catch!

706
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,083
Coming over.

707
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:16,333
You must jump. It's the only way.

708
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,208
Now catch it!

709
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:35,583
Don't worry, it's perfectly safe.
Look, I'll catch you.

710
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:45,708
(Screams)

711
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:48,708
Oh, no!

712
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,541
Short-wave light radiations.

713
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,458
That should confuse their detectors.

714
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,916
(Beeping)

715
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:39,958
They are attacking our instruments.

716
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:44,208
Move. We can take them by surprise.

717
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,208
Stay where you are.

718
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:59,625
Do not move.

719
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:13,125
Do not move. Do not move.

720
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:17,208
You are our prisoners.

721
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:42,041
No, Antodus! No!

722
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:59,166
Hey! Get me out of here!

723
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,625
- He's all right!
- Oh, what a relief!

724
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,500
But why must you destroy the Thals?

725
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:10,916
Why can't you live together in peace
and share your knowledge?

726
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,625
We will be the rulers here.

727
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:16,958
We will share nothing.

728
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:21,000
We will explode the neutronic bomb.

729
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:25,750
Begin the countdown.

730
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,833
No!

The Doctor and his granddaughter
have been taken prisoner by the Daleks.

735
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,916
- Now it is up to us!
- What can we do?

736
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,208
We can fight!

737

<i>I68'.</i>

738
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:02,750
The Thals are moving
towards the city once more.

739
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:06,083
But it does not matter now.

740
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,958
In a few minutes,
they will all be dead.

741
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,916
Wait! I have something to tell you.

742
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:16,041
You do not know
how we came to this planet.

743
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:19,833
I have a machine which is capable of
crossing the barriers of time and space.

744
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:23,708
I will tell you its secrets
if you do not explode the bomb.

745
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:29,750
We do not believe you are capable
of creating such a machine.

746
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:33,541
- It's true!
- You took a vital part of it from me.

747
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:37,291
Examine it. You will see that it must
belong to some complicated machine.

748
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:41,791
- I have it here.
- '52.'

749
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,583
Where is the machine?

750
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:48,250
In the petrified forest outside the city.

751
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:51,250
Good. We will examine it

752
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:54,916
and use it to conquer other planets.

753
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,166
But you could not operate it without me.

754
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:59,958
We will find a way.

That's my lucky number.

798
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:15,875
All set for home.
Let's say goodbye to our friends.

799
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,375
Come along.

800
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,250
Quite a reception.

801
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:43,041
You saved our people
from the rule of the Daleks.

802
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:45,916
We do not have much
with which to thank you,

803
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:49,541
but we would like you to take these
to remember us.

804
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:52,916
- How very kind of you.
- Thank you.

805
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:55,708
Thank you so much.
We will treasure them.

806
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,625
Thank you.

807
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,333
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

808
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:01,541
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

809
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:04,125
- (Barbara) Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

810
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,333
- (Goodbye!
<i>'</i> Gan) Goodbye,

811
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,583
- Goodbye.
- (Barbara) Goodbye.

812
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:10,541
- (Susie) Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

813
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,875
You'll look pretty funny
wearing that in London.

814
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,583
Hey!

815
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:26,958
Thank you, Barbara.

816
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:31,500
Oh! And now we will return
to our own time and place.

817
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:34,541
- Thank goodness for that.
- Just push the lever, lad.

818
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,416
(Whirring)

819
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,291
Ah. Now if you'll open the door,

820
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,583
you will find
we're back in our own little garden.

821
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,333
Always nice to get home, isn't it?

822
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,958
(I Military drums beat)

823
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:01,416
Hey! You ought to see what...

824
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,250
Look out! They're coming!

825
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,916
(Screeching and beeping)

826
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,666
Well, do something!

827
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,541
(I Theme music)
