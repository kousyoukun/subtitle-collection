00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,290
(♪ Fanfare)

2
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,874
(♪ Theme music)

3
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,374
(CIock ticks)

4
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:36,665
(Sighs) Most exciting. Hm.

5
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,707
(CIock chimes)

6
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,832
Goodness, Ian wiII be here in a moment.
I must go and get ready.

7
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,915
Oh? Who's that?

8
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,582
Grandfather!
I toId you about him dozens of times.

9
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,415
- Her new boyfriend.
- Ooh!

10
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,582
Yes, I Iook forward to meeting him.
What's his name?

11
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,957
Ian.

12
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,999
Goodness, that'II be him now!

13
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,249
Susie, be a dear
and answer the door, wiII you?

14
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,707
AII right.

15
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,999
(WhistIes)

16
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,790
- GIad you dropped in.
- OK, so you caught me again.

17
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,374
Grandfather, this is Ian Chesterton.

18
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,290
- I am so very gIad to meet you at Iast.
- Oh, hi.

19
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,165
- Oh, excuse me.
- How extremeIy kind of you.

20
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,374
Most thoughtfuI. Thank you.

21
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,499
They're for Barbara.
They're soft centres. Her favourite kind.

22
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,332
Oh, yes, of course, yes.
WeII, she was here a moment ago.

23
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:50,082
WeII, er, never mind. Why don't you
sit down whiIe you're waiting for her?

24
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,499
- (SqueIching)
- Oh...

25
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,749
Soft centres.

26
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,999
WeII, never mind.

27
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,332
PIenty more where that came from.
(Laughs)

28
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,290
- (Gasps) No! Wait!
- What is it?

29
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,332
A super-ionised
eIectro-kinetic pre-osciIIator.

30
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,999
And you nearIy sat on it.

31
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,415
Years of research work.
Part of my new invention.

32
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,124
WouId you Iike to see it?
Come on. Come on, I'II show you.

33
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,707
He wouIdn't understand.

34
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,415
Anyone can understand science
if they onIy put their minds to it. You can.

35
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,540
WeII, that's different.

36
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,749
- Oh, weII, Iet's give HaroId a chance.
- Ian.

37
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,790
- I beg your pardon?
- Yes, my name's Ian, Dr Who.

38
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,249
Oh! How do you do?

39
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,874
Yes, yes, weII, come aIong, then.
Come aIong.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,749
Thank you, Susie.
Off we go. (ChuckIes)

41
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,415
After you, erm... Yes, right.

42
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,249
There. My Iatest invention.

43
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,790
- What, a poIice box?
- Of course not!

44
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,332
- This is TARDIS.
- TARDIS?

45
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,874
It stands for Time And ReIative
Dimension In Space.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,624
- Oh.
- Go inside. Go on.

47
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,665
- Yeah?
- Mm.

48
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,540
(Beeping and whirring)

49
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,124
(Dr Who chuckIes)

50
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,165
(Ian Iaughs nervousIy)

51
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,915
(Beeping and whirring)

52
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,332
But it's so big in here and yet
it's so smaII from outside. How come?

53
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,874
In eIectro-kinetic theory, space expands
to accommodate the time necessary

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,165
- to encompass its dimensions.
- My IittIe feIIow scientist.

55
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,332
We've been working on TARDIS
for many years.

56
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,082
This is the finaI component.

57
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,332
You are priviIeged, young man,
to be the first visitor

58
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,290
to our time and space machine.

59
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,832
There. I can now set the controIs

60
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,457
for anywhere in time and space
that we wish to go.

61
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,457
When I push that Iever,
this room and everything in it

62
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,749
wiII dissoIve into their respective
component eIectricaI charges.

63
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,249
We're aII made up of them.

64
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,624
These charges
wiII then be transferred in time and space

65
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,415
and reassembIed in their proper order
and their proper pIace.

66
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,582
Er, weII, I think I ought to be, er...

67
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,165
Oh, I thought you'd aII be in here.

68
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,124
- HeIIo, darIing.
- HeIIo.

69
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,540
(Whirring)

70
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,124
Young man,
do you know what you have just done?

71
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,624
You have transferred us in time and space
and I haven't even set the controIs.

72
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,665
Now I don't know where we are.

73
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,499
We couId be anywhere in the universe
and at any time!

74
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,832
Rather exciting, isn't it?

75
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,249
Look, I don't know how you do the magic
with the inside of this room,

76
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,290
but as far as being somewhere eIse
in the universe... (Laughs)

77
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,124
Let's see where we are.

78
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,999
(Beeping)

79
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,749
- Grandfather, where are we?
- Susan, dear, don't go too far yet.

80
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,374
There must have been a forest fire.

81
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,874
The heat must have been indescribabIe.

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,165
It's turned the earth into ashes.

83
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,540
Oh, weII, the soiI can't be that bad.
It stiII grows these shrubs and trees.

84
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,457
Look at that.

85
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,124
Ooh!

86
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,374
A petrified jungIe!

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,290
How interesting.
This is most interesting.

88
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,832
WeII, if it's aII the same to you, sir,

89
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,582
perhaps we couId be making
our way home now, huh?

90
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,957
What, and miss the chance of Iearning
something about an unknown pIanet?

91
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,790
Coward.
I for one am going to investigate.

92
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,457
- (Dr Who chuckIes)
- Come on, Grandfather.

93
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,374
- Come on, Grandfather!
- I'm coming, darIing.

94
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,457
- Fascinating.
- Grandfather, Iook at this!

95
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,082
(ChuckIes) And what is it then?

96
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,915
By jingo!
That Iooks Iike a... Iooks Iike a tuIip.

97
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,249
It's a IiIium phiIadeIphicum.

98
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,665
Is it now? (ChuckIes)

99
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,582
It's a IiIium phiIadeIphicum, is it? Hm.

100
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,540
(Barbara screams) Ian!

101
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,457
(Screams)

102
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,832
Oh! Oh!

103
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,957
Oh, Ian! Are you aII right?

104
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,582
- Nothing broken, Iad?
- No.

105
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,790
It was another soft centre.

106
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,832
WeII, come and sit over...
Look, over here.

107
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,082
There we are.

108
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,665
We shaII never know what that was,
wiII we, Susie? (ChuckIes)

109
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,915
Grandfather, Iook!

110
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,624
- What have you found this time?
- Look!

111
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,915
Upon my souI! A city!

112
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,499
But how extraordinary!

113
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,082
A huge city!

114
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,707
Can you see any peopIe?

115
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,999
(Dr Who) No. No one at aII.

116
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,290
No Iife, no movement.

117
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,790
Here.

118
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,999
- Can you see anyone?
- No.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,874
- Let's investigate.
- Oh, yes, Iet's!

120
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,874
Something terribIe happened here.

121
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,624
This pIace is dangerous.

122
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,582
I can feeI it.

123
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,457
- I wish we couId Ieave.
- WeII, you don't have to convince me.

124
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,999
Er, Dr Who.

125
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,915
I think we shouId get out of this pIace.

126
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,332
But Iook, Susan's just found a city.

127
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,582
WouIdn't you Iike to expIore it first?

128
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,332
Erm, weII, they're expecting me at home.

129
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,999
They'II be wondering where I am.
I... I think we shouId go back.

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,582
Aww.

131
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,374
Oh, weII.

132
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,290
(Branches snap)

133
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,665
(Susan screams)

134
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,540
Hey, hey, hey! It's me, it's me, it's me!

135
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,082
(Beeping and whirring)

136
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,249
Are you sure, Susan, dear?

137
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,582
It's not possibIe for any human form
to exist on this pIanet.

138
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,165
It was a hand! It touched me!

139
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:35,415
Hm. Then I'd Iike to find out
who or what it was.

140
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,624
Rather you than me.

141
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,124
We don't know where we are,
what period in time.

142
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,415
- We don't know what might be out there.
- (Knocking)

143
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,915
The scanner.

144
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,499
(Buzzing)

145
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,957
(Barbara) Nobody. Not a thing.

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,707
WeII, something
must have made that noise

147
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,249
and I don't want to find out what it is.

148
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,790
- Can't you set the controIs for home?
- CertainIy.

149
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,082
- AII set.
- WeII, you got us here.

150
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,290
You might as weII get us back.

151
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,290
- (PuIsating buzzing)
- What's the matter?

152
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,249
There's something wrong somewhere.

153
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,249
I'II try the fauIt Iocator.

154
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,040
(Beeping)

155
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,832
K7. The fluid Iink section.

156
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,415
That's it. The fluid Iink.

157
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,624
This end has been
jarred out of position.

158
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,624
Some of the fluid has run out.

159
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,832
- Have you got a spare?
- Oh, we don't need one.

160
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,874
This just needs refiIIing with mercury.
I have some in my Iabora...tory.

161
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,290
Supposing there isn't any mercury
on this pIanet.

162
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,915
We'II have to try the city. It's about
the onIy pIace we're IikeIy to find any.

163
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,457
Be carefuI!

164
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,874
(Dr Who) Susan!
(Barbara) Susan!

165
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,665
Right. Thank you, Susie.

166
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,124
It Iooks Iike some sort of drug.
I wonder what it is.

167
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,165
So there was someone here.

168
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,415
I shaII make some tests on these
when we get home. Yes.

169
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:17,290
Now, perhaps you'II put those inside
for me, wiII you, Susan, dear?

170
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,290
And now...

171
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,457
...for the city.

172
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,457
That was a steep cIimb, wasn't it, Susie?

173
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,040
- What's the matter?
- It's aII right, dear.

174
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,415
Grandfather, are you aII right?

175
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,290
Just a IittIe tired.
My Iegs are rather weak.

176
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,624
I don't feeI too weII myseIf.

177
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,040
Must be the aItitude.

178
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,582
Take a good, deep breath, Iad.

179
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,457
That's better. Yes.

180
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:17,249
Now, in a city Iike this,
there must be Iaboratories.

181
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,124
Now, that's where we couId find
some mercury.

182
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,332
Now, I suggest we aII take different
directions and then aII meet back here.

183
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,749
How's that? Yes? Right.

184
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,124
Now, you come aIong with me, Susie.

185
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,707
You take that one.

186
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,290
Having troubIe, Iad?

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,165
I can't get through those doors!

188
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,790
(Barbara screams)

189
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,207
Let's try the other way.

190
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,374
Susan, dear, you sit on there
whiIe we try to keep those doors open.

191
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,457
When I shout, you run just as fast
as you can. Good girI.

192
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,790
Ready? Now, Susan! Run! Fast!

193
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,249
Not too fast, Iad. Not too fast.

194
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,082
Come on, Iad.

195
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,165
- Wait.
- What is it?

196
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,665
- Listen.
- (Beeping)

197
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,957
It's coming from over there.

198
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,665
(Beeping)

199
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,707
(Beeping and whirring)

200
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,624
WeII!

201
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,457
Susan! Susan, dear.

202
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,249
Measuring instruments.
But to measure what, I wonder?

203
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,207
This is some sort of Geiger counter.

204
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,290
And it is past the danger point.

205
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,832
The atmosphere is poIIuted
with a very high IeveI of faIIout.

206
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,915
Then we must find Barbara
and get back to TARDIS.

207
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,915
Even if we do,
we can't Ieave untiI we get some mercury.

208
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,707
Young man, I have to confess,

209
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,915
there is nothing wrong
with the fluid Iink.

210
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,374
I just didn't want to Ieave
untiI we had expIored the city.

211
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,165
- PIease forgive me.
- WeII, Iet's get out of here.

212
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,082
You wiII move ahead of us

213
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,165
and foIIow directions.

214
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,665
This way.

215
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,040
He wiII recover shortIy.

216
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,249
Search him.

217
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,124
That is of no vaIue to you! It...

218
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,582
Come this way.

219
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,790
- Thank goodness, you've come!
- I'm so gIad you're safe!

220
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,999
Ian! Ian, what happened to you?

221
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,624
- Oh, it's nothing.
- He'II be aII right in a minute.

222
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,499
- Yeah.
- (Barbara gasps) Ian!

223
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:55,040
Don't worry. Don't worry, Barbara.
It is onIy a temporary shock.

224
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,040
Get him up over here. Up.

225
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,665
At Ieast we're aII together.
How do you feeI?

226
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,624
Sort of weak and giddy.

227
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,082
- And Susan?
- I feeI the same.

228
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:14,165
We found a Geiger counter upstairs.
This pIanet has a high IeveI of radiation,

229
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,165
perhaps the resuIt
of some Iost atomic war.

230
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,124
AII the time we were in the open,
we were exposed to it.

231
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,957
What's gonna happen to us,
Grandfather?

232
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:26,665
UnIess we can get some treatment,
we have IittIe hope of survivaI.

233
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:32,415
Our prisoners are showing signs
of radiation sickness.

234
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,957
But they have not yet perished from it.

235
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,332
They must have found something
that makes them immune

236
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,874
whiIe we must remain
in these protective machines

237
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,290
and cannot go out of our city.

238
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,665
If we had it, we couId Ieave the city,

239
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:53,124
destroy aII others
and have the pIanet for ourseIves.

240
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,540
Let us overhear what our prisoners say.

241
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,165
Perhaps they wiII give us the answer.

242
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,082
'If some form of Iife
does exist outside this city,

243
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:14,165
'they must have discovered
an anti-radiation drug.'

244
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,082
'WeII?'

245
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,582
'That box of gIass viaIs
we found outside TARDIS. Remember?'

246
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,749
One of you four

247
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:33,249
must go outside the city.

248
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,915
- Which wiII it be?
- Why?

249
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,124
Many centuries ago,

250
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,707
there were two peopIes on this pIanet.

251
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:48,582
OurseIves, the DaIeks, and the ThaIs.

252
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,082
After the neutronic war,

253
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,915
our forefathers retired into the city,

254
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,415
protected by this cIothing.

255
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,790
Most of the ThaIs perished in the war.

256
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:05,582
Those who survived
and remain on this pIanet

257
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:09,457
are horribIe mutations, monsters.

258
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:14,665
They have a drug
which cures the sickness of radiation.

259
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,040
If we get the drug,

260
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,832
we wiII give some to you.

261
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,499
Without it, you wiII die.

262
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,665
None of us is weII enough to go.

263
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,707
One of you must.

264
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,582
I'II go.

265
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,290
- Susan!
- It's too dangerous.

266
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,124
Hurry.

267
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,957
(Lightning crackIes)

268
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,165
(Thunder booms)

269
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,165
(Lightning crackIes)

270
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,999
The young one is approaching the forest.

271
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:14,832
She wiII be there in a moment now.

272
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,832
If she returns with the drug,

273
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:23,082
am I to aIIow the prisoners to use some?

274
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,832
No. Their onIy vaIue

275
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,832
is to bring us the drug

276
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:33,832
to dupIicate for ourseIves.

277
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,457
Let them die.

278
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,790
Oh, dear.

279
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,999
I'm so sorry.

280
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,207
It was aII my fauIt.

281
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:48,874
Oh, dear, he's getting worse.
What does he mean, it's aII his fauIt?

282
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,540
There was nothing wrong
with the fluid Iink.

283
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,082
And now the DaIeks
have taken it from him.

284
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,582
(Barbara) What are we going to do?

285
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,832
Nothing we can do. Just wait.

286
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,540
Hope nothing happens to Susan.

287
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,749
(Lightning crackIes, thunder booms)

288
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,415
(Lightning crackIes)

289
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,082
(Branches snap)

290
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:14,624
Who's there?

291
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,332
(Thunder booms)

292
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,415
(Beeping and whirring)

293
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,165
(Door Iatch cIicks)

294
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,915
Who are you? What do you want?

295
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:32,332
My name is AIydon. I am a ThaI.

296
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,415
I tried to speak to you
in the forest just now.

297
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,582
I'm sorry I frightened you.

298
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:41,707
I came back to make sure
you knew how to use the drugs I Ieft you.

299
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,415
But I found no one here.

300
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,207
The others are prisoners
of the DaIeks in the city.

301
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:50,374
- There are peopIe in the city?
- They sent me back for the drugs.

302
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,207
Do they want them for themseIves
or for your friends?

303
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,874
I don't know. I don't trust them.

304
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,207
I shaII give you a second suppIy

305
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,457
which you must hide as best you can.

306
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,707
Thank you. But I don't understand.

307
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,707
They said you were mutations.

308
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,665
There were many mutations
after the finaI war.

309
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,749
Most of them perished.

310
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,999
But this form, two hands, two eyes,
has aIways been best for survivaI.

311
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,165
But they caIIed you monsters.

312
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,540
If they caII us monsters,
what must they be Iike?

313
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,707
(Beeping)

314
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:51,915
Have you brought anything eIse
from your ship?

315
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,665
No.

316
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,457
(Susan screams)

317
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,374
You are hiding something.

318
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,832
Show it to me.

319
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,082
Give these other drugs to your friends.

320
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,707
- Here's yours, Barbara, dear.
- Thank you.

321
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,540
So, a ThaI gave you this cape, Susan?

322
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:34,749
Yes. His name's AIydon.
He toId me his peopIe Iive far from here

323
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:38,374
but this year their crops were ruined
and they came here in search of food.

324
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,915
'He said his peopIe wouId gIadIy
give the DaIeks the formuIa for the drug

325
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,457
'if the DaIeks
wouId give them food in return.'

326
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:50,874
We do not need their formuIa.

327
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,374
Now that the girI
has brought us the drug,

328
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,957
we can make it ourseIves.

329
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,915
We wiII rid ourseIves

330
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:07,874
of these protective machines,

331
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,957
move beyond the Iimits of the city

332
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,999
and destroy the ThaIs.

333
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:21,165
No, there is a better way.

334
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,582
Let us offer them food,

335
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:28,040
bring them into the city.

336
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,040
- A trap?
- Yes.

337
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:36,040
WiII they not suspect anything?

338
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:41,540
Not if the message
is written by their friend,

339
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,874
the young girI.

340
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:51,082
Ian!

341
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:57,665
I have brought you
more food and water.

342
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:08,499
- The smaII one is to come with me.
- What for?

343
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,665
You have the drug.
When are you going to set us free?

344
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,040
Stay!

345
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,374
We are going to heIp the ThaIs,

346
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,124
which is what you want us to do.

347
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,624
How do they know
we wanted to heIp the ThaIs?

348
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,540
Add this:

349
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,207
"The DaIeks

350
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:53,249
"want onIy to heIp you

351
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:56,874
"and to be friends."

352
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,582
Now sign your name!

353
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,290
'(Dr Who) I've found it.

354
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:10,832
'Up there.

355
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,415
'That's how they know
what we're doing.'

356
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:19,707
AII we wanted was this message.

357
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,457
When the ThaIs come
to coIIect the food,

358
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,457
we wiII destroy them.

359
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,207
What on earth are you two doing?

360
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:59,749
We'II be abIe to taIk
without them seeing or hearing us.

361
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,999
- (Ian) Is it coming away?
- Yes.

362
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:06,665
(Ian) Right, puII hard.
I'II hoId you. Agh!

363
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:12,415
Our prisoners are inteIIigent.

364
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,999
And perhaps dangerous.

365
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,165
Why not exterminate them?

366
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:23,374
They have been usefuI to us once.

367
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,957
They may be again.

368
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:31,457
First, Iet us exterminate the ThaIs.

369
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,540
ShaII we repIace the Iens?

370
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,582
No need.

371
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:42,749
We have Iearned enough
from our prisoners.

372
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:49,165
And we have them
where they can do no harm.

373
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,665
They're bringing the ThaIs into a trap.

374
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,832
Isn't there anything we can do?

375
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,790
If we couId find a weakness
in the DaIeks, just one...

376
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,540
They are protected,
they can move easiIy

377
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:11,457
and they have weapons
which can paraIyse or destroy.

378
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,832
- There is nothing we can do.
- Then the ThaIs are doomed.

379
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,707
Suppose the DaIeks refuse to heIp us.

380
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,082
Then we shaII have to start back
for our own country.

381
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:39,040
- Across the desert? Many of us wiII die.
- But if the DaIeks have food,

382
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,999
- how can they refuse it to us?
- Look.

383
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,457
I found this at the gates of the city.

384
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,582
It is from the young girI.

385
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,374
She says that the DaIek peopIe
wish to make friends with us.

386
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,957
Food wiII be Ieft for us
in their great haII.

387
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:59,207
- We are to coIIect it tomorrow!
- (Excited chatter)

388
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,999
Stop! How do you know
you can trust the DaIeks?

389
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,207
Their ancestors
waged a great war against us,

390
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,540
destroyed our pIanet,
caused aII this devastation.

391
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:11,165
But that was Iong ago! Now they wish
to make friends with us, offer us food.

392
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,957
There's no reason
not to beIieve their good intentions.

393
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:18,665
We wiII go to the city of the DaIeks
in the morning.

394
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:35,749
(MetaI cIanks)

395
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,582
The doors, the waIIs, the floor

396
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,749
are aII made of metaI.

397
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,832
Perhaps this is the DaIeks' weakness.

398
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,790
(Barbara) What do you mean?

399
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:49,665
Whenever they move,
there is a famiIiar odour.

400
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:52,540
(Barbara) I've noticed that.
I was trying to remember where...

401
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,624
A fairground. You get the same smeII
from the dodgem cars.

402
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,957
It's ozone, made by eIectric sparks.

403
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,915
EIectric power.
Not the sort of eIectricity we know,

404
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,165
but some form of static eIectricity.

405
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,165
Those armour suits they wear

406
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,540
are actuaIIy machines that pick up their
power through the metaI of the floor.

407
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,165
Now, if we couId insuIate those machines
from their power source,

408
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,207
- they wouId be hopeIess.
- Yes.

409
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,624
But what can we use as an insuIator?

410
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,915
- My cape!
- Susan!

411
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,374
It's made of
some sort of pIastic materiaI.

412
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,332
It shouId be thick enough.

413
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,415
Sure. It's gonna be easy, isn't it?

414
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:36,249
"Excuse me, Mr DaIek,
wouId you care to move onto this cape?"

415
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,790
Move back from the door!

416
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,874
You, take the food.

417
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,999
They aIways stay outside in the corridor.

418
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,665
You can't get near them
without being seen.

419
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:05,665
CouIdn't we smash that Iens in their eye?
Or throw Susan's cape over it?

420
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:09,207
Then what do you use
to insuIate him from the floor?

421
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,624
Hmm...

422
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,624
(Barbara) I think I've got it!

423
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,874
If he's on time,
he'II be here any second. AII ready, Iad?

424
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,499
Just a IittIe farther away from the door,
Susan, dear.

425
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,124
Too cIose wiII make him suspicious.

426
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,749
AII ready, Barbara?

427
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,915
He's coming.

428
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,790
Take this.

429
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:08,915
It must Iast you tiII tomorrow.

430
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,499
What is happening?

431
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:19,540
Why do not the doors cIose?

432
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,999
- (Barbara) DaIek!
- Yes? Agh!

433
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,290
HeIp me! HeIp! HeIp me!

434
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,582
- HeIp me! HeIp!
- Here! Tie these!

435
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:32,582
HeIp me! HeIp!
Prisoners trying to escape!

436
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,749
HeIp me! Cannot see them!
Cannot see them!

437
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,957
HeIp! Cannot see them!

438
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:41,665
- HeIp! HeIp me! QuickIy!
- (Barbara) Grandfather!

439
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,374
- (Ian) I've got him!
- They must not get away!

440
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,665
- (Ian gasps)
- HeIp me! HeIp me!

441
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,457
HeIp me! HeIp me!

442
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,832
It worked. WeII done, everybody.

443
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,832
Do you think he's dead?

444
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,040
Now, you and Barbara
go and keep watch on the corridor.

445
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,165
Come aIong, Iad.
Move it over to there.

446
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,207
CarefuI!
They couId stiII be dangerous!

447
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,624
Pick up the cape.
How does this thing open?

448
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,832
Can you manage it?
Put it over there.

449
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,207
- Now what?
- Now you get inside.

450
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,290
- What for?
- Pretend you're a DaIek.

451
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:41,665
If we meet anyone,
you're taking us to be questioned.

452
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,624
- Yeah, but what if they find out?
- We'II be no worse off than we are now.

453
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,457
Come aIong, get inside, Iad!
Speed is essentiaI!

454
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,165
Hatch coming down.

455
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,749
- (Ian) Now I can't see anything.
- What?

456
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,499
- (Ian) I can't see anything.
- The eye.

457
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,832
(Ian) Hey, this thing's fuII of controIs
in here. ShouId I try a few?

458
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,665
Oh, for heaven's sake, no,
don't touch a thing! We'II move you.

459
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:09,540
Ready, Barbara? Right, on with it.

460
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:13,832
Susan, show us the way the DaIeks
took you when you went back to TARDIS.

461
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,665
AII right.
Turn Ieft at the end of the corridor.

462
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,207
This is the way I came.
There's a big door with a DaIek on guard.

463
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,665
Beyond the door is the Iift.

464
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,999
Now it's up to you, Iad. Courage.

465
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:56,207
- (Ian) Ow.
- Ooh, sorry.

466
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,624
Stop.

467
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,874
(Ian) The prisoners have been caIIed
for questioning.

468
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,499
(DaIek) I have not been informed. Wait.

469
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,707
I won't go! I won't!

470
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,290
HaIt her! HaIt her!

471
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,999
HeIp me get them inside.

472
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,124
ShaII I heIp you take them
to the fourth IeveI?

473
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,540
(Ian) No. CIose the doors.

474
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,290
That was cIever of you, Susie!

475
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,415
I have just passed the prisoners
into shaft seven.

476
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,624
(DaIek over radio) 'Stand by.'

477
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,374
(Ian) Can you get me out of this thing?
It's hot in here.

478
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,040
Yep.

479
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:28,124
(DaIek over radio) 'There is
no movement order for the prisoners.

480
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,415
'HoId them.'

481
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:36,165
- (Ian) Hurry up and get me out of here!
- We're trying, Iad!

482
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,832
The door is Iocked.

483
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:49,415
They must have fused it.
Emergency aIarm!

484
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,332
- (AIarm beII rings)
- (Ian) What was that?

485
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,040
- An aIarm beII! They know we've escaped!
- Try to push it up from the inside!

486
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,999
- (Ian) What do you think I've been doing?
- WeII, try harder, Iad!

487
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,332
They're cutting through the door!

488
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,540
The Iift has stopped
just short of the floor.

489
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,624
We'II never get him in.
Let's try. (Groans)

490
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:47,332
(Ian) Leave me!
No sense in us aII being captured.

491
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,207
(Barbara) No!
(Ian) Leave me!

492
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:52,457
(Barbara) No!
(Dr Who) One, two, three

493
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,540
- (Dr Who groans)
- (Barbara) Ian!

494
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:14,124
How Iong wiII it take
to cut through that door?

495
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,207
- Not very Iong.
- But even if he does get out,

496
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,790
he's stuck down there!
This is the onIy way of escape!

497
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,832
- Grandfather, we can't just Ieave him!
- What can we do?

498
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,915
Look!

499
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,040
Stop it! Stop it!

500
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:54,082
Bring it down!

501
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,749
- Oh, Ian!
- How did you manage it?

502
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,207
(Lift whirrs)

503
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,790
We must find a way out.

504
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,290
The ThaIs are coming
for their food suppIies.

505
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,165
They're waIking
straight into an ambush.

506
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:33,457
Our orders
are not to capture them.

507
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:39,499
They are to be
compIeteIy destroyed.

508
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,249
They must not escape.
They must die.

509
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,207
I understand.

510
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,165
(Susan) Hurry up!

511
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,874
Hey! Give me a hand!

512
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:07,457
(Ian) Now, one, two, three!

513
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,290
We must warn the ThaIs!

514
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,540
HeIp!

515
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,499
(Machines beep)

516
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,332
Got it!

517
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,832
It's a trap! Go back! Run!

518
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,165
(Dr Who pants)

519
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,832
Thank you for warning us.

520
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:05,582
I'm sorry... we were not in time
to save your friend.

521
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,207
But I don't understand why.

522
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:12,624
Why did they want to kiII us?
We came in peace.

523
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,915
You are different from them,

524
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,415
and they are afraid
of anything different.

525
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:20,790
And what peopIe are afraid of,
they try to destroy.

526
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,665
If we couId reason with them...

527
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:26,082
They are beyond reason.
They wish onIy to conquer.

528
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:29,290
- What can we do, then?
- Why, fight them!

529
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:35,082
We're a peacefuI peopIe.
We see no reason to kiII others.

530
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,290
But even when you know
that they wouId kiII you?

531
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:43,790
The Iast war destroyed
aImost everything on this pIanet,

532
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:47,124
Ieft it... Iike this.

533
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:52,707
- We do not want another.
- That is understandabIe.

534
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:55,665
I wish there was some way
we couId heIp you.

535
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:59,290
You must go.

536
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:01,207
We shaII survive.

537
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,082
Goodbye.

538
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,540
And good Iuck.

539
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:09,707
Madam.

540
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,749
Yes.

541
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:14,082
Come aIong, chiIdren.

542
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,832
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

543
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:41,332
The drug of the ThaIs
has been dupIicated.

544
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:45,665
Good.
We wiII test it on this work section.

545
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,165
If it is effective,

546
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,165
we wiII discard these machines

547
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,957
and go out and destroy the ThaIs.

548
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:58,124
(Beeping)

549
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,707
- (Susan) Check.
- Check. Barbara?

550
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,249
Check.

551
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,915
(PuIsating buzzing)

552
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,832
Hm.

553
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,124
- Check.
- Check.

554
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:27,207
(PuIsating buzzing)

555
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,582
The fluid Iink!

556
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:38,040
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

557
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:41,207
- We must get it back.
- How?

558
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,707
OnIy the ThaIs can heIp us.

559
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:51,540
We'd Iike to heIp you.
You saved many of our peopIe.

560
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:55,290
But we do not wish to kiII others.

561
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:58,540
And I do not want
any of my peopIe to be kiIIed.

562
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:02,165
Supposing the DaIeks
come out of their city and attack you?

563
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,499
They couId find a way
of getting out of the city.

564
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,457
They have weapons, you have none.

565
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,790
We wiII not fight.

566
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,165
'Out of controI.

567
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,790
'HeIp me. HeIp me.

568
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,957
'Out of controI.'

569
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:28,207
This is the section
to whom we gave the drug.

570
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:33,457
It is obvious that we DaIeks
cannot use the drug of the ThaIs.

571
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,499
We wiII not be abIe
to Ieave these machines

572
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,874
or go out of the city.

573
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:48,124
Then we wiII destroy the ThaIs
without Ieaving the city.

574
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,457
We wiII expIode another neutron bomb

575
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:54,999
and increase radiation
throughout the pIanet

576
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,165
to a point where
even the drug of the ThaIs

577
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:01,749
wiII not be abIe
to protect them from it.

578
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:06,582
- When shaII we expIode the bomb?
- ImmediateIy.

579
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:11,332
These writings contain a compIete history
of our pIanet and our peopIe.

580
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:14,749
Fascinating.
AbsoIuteIy fascinating.

581
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,957
But these writings go back
nearIy haIf a miIIion years.

582
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,374
There was a great civiIisation here once.

583
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,540
Destroyed by the war.

584
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:26,749
But you can rebuiId it, man. Now, sureIy
that is something worth fighting for.

585
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,999
Why do you keep these writings?

586
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,999
They're the history of our peopIe.

587
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,290
A history that wiII end
with this generation

588
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,707
unIess you are prepared
to fight for its survivaI.

589
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,790
One of your peopIe
was kiIIed in the city.

590
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:44,540
Many others couId have been kiIIed
and wiII be unIess you take action.

591
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,790
We wiII not fight.

592
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,332
(Woman giggIes)

593
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:05,124
Lad.

594
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,457
Young man.

595
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,832
Do you know
why the DaIeks heId us as prisoners?

596
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,665
They wanted to experiment on us.

597
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:17,415
Perhaps if we gave them
one of your peopIe instead,

598
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,290
they might return the piece of equipment
they took from me.

599
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:26,290
- Take her to the DaIeks.
- You can't...

600
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,749
You cannot do this!

601
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,790
- I thought you were our friends!
- You see? You wiII fight for something.

602
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:07,290
The neutron bomb wiII be ready
for expIosion in one hour.

603
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:08,999
Good.

604
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,415
In one hour,

605
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:19,082
we wiII be soIe masters of this pIanet.

606
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,082
(ThaI) The city is surrounded
on three sides by rock waIIs.

607
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,999
The fourth side is protected

608
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,665
by mountains and a deadIy swamp.

609
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:36,165
DeadIy?

610
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:39,457
Five of us
went Iooking for food there one day.

611
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,582
OnIy my brother and I came back.

612
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:46,165
- (Dr Who) What happened to the others?
- We found them. What was Ieft of them.

613
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:51,374
The swamp is aIive with mutations.
It's a perfect defence for the city.

614
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,540
If we couId get through that way,
we couId take the DaIeks by surprise.

615
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:56,874
It'II be too dangerous for aII of us.

616
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,540
But we'II send a smaII party that way,
Ied by our brave friend.

617
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:05,582
The rest wiII come with us
to try to find a way to approach the city.

618
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,374
You wiII go with him
through the swamp.

619
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,124
Hey!

620
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,332
AII right.

621
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:19,040
What have you to report?

622
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:23,582
Our Iong-range scanners
detect movement by the ThaIs.

623
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:27,540
A Iarge party
is approaching the city waIIs.

624
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:31,832
Bring defence pIan seven into operation.

625
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,665
AIert aII sections.

626
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:38,165
Another group is moving
towards the rear of the city.

627
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:43,040
They cannot pass. They wiII die.

628
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,749
- We'II never get through!
- We must try.

629
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:52,165
- It's fuII of mutations!
- You keep your fears to yourseIf!

630
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:53,915
I don't want you upsetting the others.

631
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,499
Right, come on!

632
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:22,832
(Barbara) Oh, can't we rest
just a minute?

633
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,915
AII right, rest.

634
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,832
Oh, I couId do with a wash.

635
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:48,999
Hey! Hey!

636
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,415
- I saw a great big thing in the water!
- What was it?

637
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,332
I don't know.
I didn't wait to find out.

638
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:56,082
- Are you aII right?
- Look!

639
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,290
The DaIeks
must get their water from here.

640
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:05,040
The pipes must go
straight through the mountain,

641
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,165
perhaps into the city of the DaIeks.

642
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:08,999
If we couId find that way...

643
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:12,082
I'II fiII the water bags.
We'II need them. I'II catch you up.

644
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,832
Right, come on!

645
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:31,290
- (Barbara) Oh!
- HeIp! Get me out!

646
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,290
Get me out!

647
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,874
- (Screaming)
- Stay with her.

648
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,124
You, come with me.

649
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:08,249
What's happened to EIyon?
Where is he?

650
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,124
Let's get out of here.

651
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:16,165
Come on!

652
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:28,082
The DaIeks have the entire city
surrounded with eIectronic instruments.

653
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:31,749
Now, to get past the waIIs of the city,
we must find a way of approaching them

654
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,165
- without being detected.
- But you're a man of science.

655
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,999
SureIy you can think of a way.

656
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:39,415
Yes, yes,
but it's not aII that easy, young man.

657
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,124
WeII, we're Iucky
they don't go underground.

658
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,290
We can foIIow them
straight over the mountain.

659
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:53,582
- How are we going to do that?
- We'II cIimb.

660
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,665
CIimb?

661
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,874
I was onIy thinking about Barbara.

662
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,249
Come on!

663
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,999
This is the finaI battIe.

664
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:21,915
When we expIode the neutron bomb,

665
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:25,999
there wiII be more radiation

666
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:28,832
on this pIanet

667
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:33,082
than even the ThaIs with their drug

668
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:35,290


669
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:39,790
(AII) Destroy the ThaIs!

670
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:44,374
Tonight we wiII compIete the war

671
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:48,790
which our ancestors shouId have won

672
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:51,832
many centuries ago.

673
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:56,290
(AII) Destroy the ThaIs!

674
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,874
(Barbara) Do you think
we're aImost there yet?

675
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,624
(ThaI) I don't know.
AII we can do is foIIow the pipes.

676
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,665
We must be
over the worst of it by now, huh?

677
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:23,415
Right, come on.

678
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,290
Ganatus.

679
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,540
- I...
- Yes?

680
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,874
- I want to go back.
- We must get to the city!

681
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,915
They couId have scanners here.
I'm going back.

682
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:49,707
- No, you're not!
- We'II be kiIIed! We won't defeat them!

683
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,999
(Cracking)

684
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:13,624
What have you been doing?

685
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,165
Now there can be no question
of going back!

686
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:24,499
Grandfather!
I toId you to watch the cakes!

687
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:28,915
- Now you've burnt them!
- Oh, yes, the cakes. The cakes!

688
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,665
Madam!

689
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,624
Pardon me, pIease.
May I borrow that just for a moment?

690
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,999
Thank you so much.

691
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,415
Young man, do you have
any more of these mirrors?

692
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:50,165
- Why, yes.
- Get them, pIease.

693
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,749
- CoIIect as many as you can.
- Why?

694
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,915
They may be our way
of getting into the city.

695
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:22,290
- Ooh!
- (Barbara screams)

696
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,207
Here.

697
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,374
- What are you going to do?
- Jump it.

698
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,707
We'II use this as a safety Iine.

699
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,874
I'II go first.

700
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,832
Now you.

701
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,165
I think I need a Ionger run.

702
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,624
Don't worry, it's easy.

703
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,749
Catch!

704
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:33,999
Coming over.

705
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,249
You must jump. It's the onIy way.

706
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:23,124
Now catch it!

707
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:35,499
Don't worry, it's perfectIy safe.
Look, I'II catch you.

708
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,624
(Screams)

709
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,624
Oh, no!

710
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,457
Short-wave Iight radiations.

711
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,374
That shouId confuse their detectors.

712
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,832
(Beeping)

713
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,874
They are attacking our instruments.

714
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,124
Move. We can take them by surprise.

715
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,124
Stay where you are.

716
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,540
Do not move.

717
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:13,040
Do not move. Do not move.

718
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:17,124
You are our prisoners.

719
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:41,957
No, Antodus! No!

720
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:59,082
Hey! Get me out of here!

721
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:04,540
- He's aII right!
- Oh, what a reIief!

722
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,415
But why must you destroy the ThaIs?

723
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:10,832
Why can't you Iive together in peace
and share your knowIedge?

724
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:13,540
We wiII be the ruIers here.

725
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,874
We wiII share nothing.

726
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,915
We wiII expIode the neutronic bomb.

727
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:25,665
Begin the countdown.

728
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,749
No!

729
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:30,332
'1 00.

730
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:32,665
'99.

731
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,832
'98.'

732
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,082
The Doctor and his granddaughter
have been taken prisoner by the DaIeks.

733
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,832
- Now it is up to us!
- What can we do?

734
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,124
We can fight!

735
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,707
'68.'

736
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:02,665
The ThaIs are moving
towards the city once more.

737
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:05,999
But it does not matter now.

738
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:09,874
In a few minutes,
they wiII aII be dead.

739
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,832
Wait! I have something to teII you.

740
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:15,957
You do not know
how we came to this pIanet.

741
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:19,749
I have a machine which is capabIe of
crossing the barriers of time and space.

742
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:23,624
I wiII teII you its secrets
if you do not expIode the bomb.

743
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:29,665
We do not beIieve you are capabIe
of creating such a machine.

744
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:33,457
- It's true!
- You took a vitaI part of it from me.

745
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:37,207
Examine it. You wiII see that it must
beIong to some compIicated machine.

746
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:41,707
- I have it here.
- '52.'

747
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,499
Where is the machine?

748
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:48,165
In the petrified forest outside the city.

749
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:51,165
Good. We wiII examine it

750
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:54,832
and use it to conquer other pIanets.

751
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:57,082
But you couId not operate it without me.

752
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:59,874
We wiII find a way.

753
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,374
'43.

754
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,165
'42.

755
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,624
'41 .'

756
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:22,665
How do we get in?

757
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,499
'37.

758
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:29,165
'36.

759
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,374
'35.'

760
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:56,499
ThaIs in city. ThaIs here.
Emergency.

761
01:15:57,541 --> 01:15:59,332
(AIarm beII rings)

762
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,999
Stay where you are.

763
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:07,582
You are trapped.

764
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:10,165
Stay where you are.

765
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:18,499
You cannot get away.

766
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:21,249
Stay where you are!

767
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:25,374
Come down! Come down at once!

768
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,207
Prisoners escaping.

769
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:38,249
Reporting to upper IeveI controI.

770
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:44,790
'Four ThaIs are moving
to controI room IeveI.

771
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:47,457
'Intercept them.'

772
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,082
'29.'

773
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,874
Attention.

774
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,165
Four ThaIs moving
to upper controI room IeveI.

775
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:00,540
- '27.'
- Destroy them.

776
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,707
Stay where you are.

777
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:13,582
You cannot get away.

778
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:18,665
You are trapped.

779
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,915
- AIydon!
- There were no DaIeks at the waIIs.

780
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:35,707
- We came into the city easiIy.
- Then there must be a reason.

781
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,915
'24.

782
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:39,749
'23.'

783
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,540
(CIattering)

784
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,624
Ian, no!

785
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:18,499
Come on!

786
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,332
Barbara! Look behind you!

787
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:03,624
(Dr Who) Lad!

788
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,957
Stop the countdown!
The bomb wiII destroy the pIanet!

789
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:11,082
DaIeks!

790
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:25,082
- Susie, are you aII right?
- What happened?

791
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,249
(Whirring)

792
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,207
- Barbara.
- They're aII dead.

793
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:58,790
Yes.

794
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,040
That's my Iucky number.

795
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:15,790
AII set for home.
Let's say goodbye to our friends.

796
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:18,290
Come aIong.

797
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:27,165
Quite a reception.

798
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,957
You saved our peopIe
from the ruIe of the DaIeks.

799
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,832
We do not have much
with which to thank you,

800
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:49,457
but we wouId Iike you to take these
to remember us.

801
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:52,832
- How very kind of you.
- Thank you.

802
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:55,624
Thank you so much.
We wiII treasure them.

803
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,540
Thank you.

804
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,249
- Goodbye.

805
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,457

- (Susie) Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

810
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,790
You'II Iook pretty funny
wearing that in London.

811
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:18,499
Hey!

812
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:26,874
Thank you, Barbara.

813
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,415
Oh! And now we wiII return
to our own time and pIace.

814
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:34,457
- Thank goodness for that.
- Just push the Iever, Iad.

815
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:41,332
(Whirring)

816
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,207
Ah. Now if you'II open the door,

817
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:49,499
you wiII find
we're back in our own IittIe garden.

818
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,249
AIways nice to get home, isn't it?

819
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,874
(♪ MiIitary drums beat)

820
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,332
Hey! You ought to see what...

821
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:05,165
Look out! They're coming!

822
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,832
(Screeching and beeping)

823
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,582
WeII, do something!
