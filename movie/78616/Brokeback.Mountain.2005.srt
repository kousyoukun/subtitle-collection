1
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,618
片名：《断背山》

2
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:33,092
1963年，怀俄明锡诺镇

3
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:47,036
烂车！
Shit.

4
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,630
如果你们两个小子想找工作
You pair of deuces lookin' for work...

5
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,367
我建议你们立刻滚进来
I suggest you get your scrawny asses in here pronto.

6
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,321
在断背山上
(Aguirre) Up on Brokeback...

7
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,281
森林管理局标有露营区
the Forest Service has got designated campsites... on the allotments.

8
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:54,732
离羊群放牧地有三、四英里
Them camps can be 3, 4 miles from where we pasture the woollies.

9
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,493
晚上没人看守 掠食动物就会来
Bad predator loss if there's nobody lookin' after 'em at night.

10
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:02,739
我要的是一名营地看守员
Now, what I want is a camp tender...

11
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:06,304
待在营地，管理局指定的地方
to stay in the main camp, where the Forest Service says.

12
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:11,014
不过牧羊人 就要在羊群旁搭帐篷
But the herder he's gonna pitch a pup tent on the QT with the sheep...

13
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,050
还要睡在那里，晚餐
and he's gonna sleep there.

14
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:17,643
和早餐在营地吃 但百分之百…
You eat your supper and breakfast in camp...

15
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,417
要跟羊群睡
but you sleep with the sheep 100%.

16
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:23,493
不准生火，不能留下痕迹
No fire, don't leave no sign.

17
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:27,196
每早收帐篷 免得被管理局抓包
You roll up that tent every mornin'... in case Forest Service snoops around.

18
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,262
喂？
Yeah?

19
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,366
不
No.

20
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,355
不行
No!

21
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,911
你这辈子都甭想
Not on your fuckin' life.

22
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,816
你有狗有枪，你睡在那里
You got your dogs, your .30-30, you sleep there.

23
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:49,910
去年夏天我损失了近25%
Last summer I had goddamn near 25% loss.

24
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,716
我不想再发生那种情况
I don't want that again.

25
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:54,117
你
You.

26
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,857
周五中午，下山到桥边
Fridays at noon, be down at the bridge...

27
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:01,154
带着你的购物清单和骡子
with your grocery list and mules...

28
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:05,326
有人会带着补给品在那等着
and somebody with supplies will be there at the pick-up.

29
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,039
明早我们会载你们到出发点
Tomorrow mornin' we'll truck you up to the jump-off.

30
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:40,498
杰克特斯
Jack Twist.

31
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:41,936
艾尼斯
Ennis.

32
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:44,707
你有名没姓啊？
Your folks just stop at Ennis?

33
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:46,701
戴尔玛
Del Mar.

34
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:50,281
幸会，艾尼斯戴尔玛
Well, nice to know you, Ennis Del Mar.

35
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,398
我第二年来这
My second year up here.

36
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:15,095
去年一场暴风雨 闪电杀死了42只羊
Last year, one storm, the lightnin' killed 42 sheep.

37
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,372
我以为那味道会薰死我
Thought I'd asphyxiate from the smell.

38
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:23,445
老板很抓狂 好像我该控制天气
Aguirre got all over my ass, like I was supposed to control the weather.

39
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:26,575
不过这比帮我老爸做事要好
But beats workin' for my old man.

40
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:29,118
根本无法讨好我老爸，不可能
 Can't please my old man, no way.

41
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:34,222
所以我才玩牛仔竞技 玩过吗？
That's why I took to rodeoin'. You ever rodeo?

42
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:38,492
我是说，偶尔玩玩
You know, I mean, once in a while.

43
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,922
一等我口袋里有钱报名就去
When I got the entry fee in my pocket.

44
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,597
是啊，你是牧场的人？
Are you from ranch people?

45
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:47,196
本来是
Yeah, I was.

46
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:51,003
你父母逼你离开？
Your folks run you off?

47
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:54,370
不，他们自己先走的
No, they run themselves off. There was...

48
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:59,983
43英里处有个转弯，他们没注意
one curve in the road in 43 miles, and they miss it.

49
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:02,477
所以
So

50
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:07,017
银行拿走牧场，兄姊养大我的
the bank took the ranch and my brother and sister, they raised me, mostly.

51
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,096
妈的，真惨
[lighter clicking] Shit, that's hard.

52
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:18,960
能不能…
Can I? Thank you.

53
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:43,554
别让它们跑丢了 老板会宰了你
(Basque) Don't let them stray. Joe will have your ass if you do.

54
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:46,289
只有一件事，别订购汤
Only thing, don't never order soup.

55
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,965
汤罐很难打包
Them soup boxes are hard to pack.

56
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,291
我不喝汤
Well, I don't eat soup.

57
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,109
小心点，那匹马很容易被吓到
You wanna watch it there. That horse has a low startle point.

58
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:04,743
没有马能抛下我，走吧
Doubt there's a filly that could throw me.

59
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:07,351
除非你打算整天坐着打绳结
Let's git, unless you wanna sit around tyin' knots all day.

60
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,059
快走！
Come on

61
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,673
该死
Oh, shit.

62
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,715
我等不及要建立自己的牧场
Can't wait till I get my own spread...

63
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,376
也不用再听老板废话了
and I won't have to put up with Joe Aguirre's crap no more.

64
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,017
我存钱想买个自己的地方
I'm savin' for a place myself.

65
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:06,886
艾玛和我，等我下山就结婚
Alma and me, we're gonna get married when I come down off this mountain.

66
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:10,290
那个跟羊睡，不准生火的规矩
Shit, that stay with the sheep, no fire bullshit.

67
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:14,896
老板无权逼我们违反规定
Aguirre got no right makin' us do somethin' against the rules.

68
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:06,321
不要再吃豆子了！
No more beans.

69
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:08,920
走啊！
Yup

70
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,122
妈的！该死！
Damn. Shit!

71
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:47,731
好了
I don't know.

72
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:48,957
有问题吗？
Something wrong?

73
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:53,789
有，为什么没奶粉跟蕃茄？
Yeah, so what.... Why didn't we get the powdered milk and the spuds?

74
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:54,998
我们只有这些
That's all we got.

75
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:59,773
这是下礼拜要的东西
Well.... Here's next week's.

76
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:03,771
我以为你不喝汤
Thought you didn't eat soup.

77
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:05,473
我受够豆子了
 Yeah, well, I'm sick of beans.

78
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:08,718
现在厌烦豆子太早了点
Too early in the summer to be sick of beans.

79
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,422
走啊！
Come on.

80
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:37,471
走！走啊！
Come on. Come on.

81
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,727
回来，你们这些畜牲
Hold on. Whoa, whoa!

82
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,780
靠
Shit.

83
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,694
继续走
Whoa. Come back here!

84
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:40,001
过来，你们这些畜牲
Whoa there, whoa. All right. Fuck it.

85
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,171
你个混蛋
(Ennis) Okay, you bastard.

86
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:47,849
你跑去哪了？
Where the hell you been?

87
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:48,974
整天跟羊混，下来这里
Been up with the sheep all day, I get down here hungry as hell...

88
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,515
饿的半死，却只能找到豆子
and all I find is beans.

89
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:58,928
怎么回事？
What in the hell happened, Ennis?

90
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,024
碰上一头熊，就这样
I come on a bear is what happened.

91
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,456
该死的马抓狂
Goddamn horse spooked and the mules took off...

92
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:06,035
骡子跑了，食物散落地上
and scattered food everywhere.

93
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,734
我们也只剩豆子了
Beans is about all we got left.

94
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:10,906
有酒吗？
 Got whiskey or somethin'?

95
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,077
蠢骡子
Dumb-ass mule.

96
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:27,318
我真不敢相信，该死
I can't believe that. God damn.

97
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,652
我看看
Let me see.

98
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,084
妈的
Shit.

99
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,860
我们得解决食物的问题
Well, we gotta do somethin' about this food situation.

100
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,368
我干脆杀一只羊好了
Maybe I'll shoot one of the sheep.

101
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:44,935
要是老板发现怎办？
Yeah, what if Aguirre finds out, huh?

102
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,767
我们应该要守护羊，不是吃羊
We're supposed to guard the sheep, not eat 'em.

103
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,039
你是怎么了？羊有上千只耶
What's the matter with you? There are a thousand of 'em.

104
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,445
我还是吃豆子吧
I'll stick with beans.

105
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:57,813
我才不要
Well, I won't.

106
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:12,831
好耶！
[whooping] Yeah!

107
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,764
受不了你老是打不中
Gettin' tired of your dumb-ass missin'.

108
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:19,507
快动手 猎杀麋鹿可不能被逮到
[laughing] Let's get a move on. Don't want the Game and Fish to catch us with no elk.

109
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,390
好，走吧
Come on. Shit.

110
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,140
我每天通勤四小时
Yeah, I'm commutin' four hours a day.

111
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,673
早上来吃早餐，再回羊群那里
I come in for breakfast, I go back to the sheep.

112
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,810
晚上整顿好它们
Evenin', get 'em bedded down.

113
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,219
再来吃晚餐，再回羊群那里
Come in for supper, go back to the sheep.

114
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,759
大半夜都在察看草原狼的踪迹
Spend hAlf the night checkin' for damn coyotes.

115
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:13,130
老板没权利逼我做这些
Aguirre got no right to make me do this.

116
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,064
要换班吗？ 我不介意陪羊群睡
You wanna switch? I wouldn't mind sleepin' out there.

117
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:21,735
不 重点是我们都该睡在这营地
That ain't the point. The point is, we both ought to be in this camp.

118
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,635
那个小帐篷又臭的跟猫尿一样
Goddamn pup tent smells like cat piss or worse.

119
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,944
我不介意待在那里
I wouldn't mind bein' out there.

120
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:34,741
我很高兴跟你换班
Well, I'm happy to switch with you...

121
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,979
不过我警告你，我不大会烹饪
but I warn you, I can't cook worth a damn.

122
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:41,083
不过我很会开罐头
I am pretty good with a can opener, though.

123
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:45,260
那你不会比我糟，好了
You can't be no worse than me, then.

124
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,288
给
Here you go.

125
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,702
我告诉你 你可没多少时间可睡
You won't get much sleep, I'll tell you that.

126
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,842
是啊
Yup.

127
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:02,010
走吧
Come on.

128
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:25,665
杀了一只草原狼，有够大只
Shot a coyote up there.It's a big son of a bitch.

129
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:27,700
它的蛋蛋有苹果那么大
He had balls on him the size of apples.

130
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,169
看来它吞得下一头骆驼
He looked like he could eat himself a camel.

131
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,743
你要热水吗？
You want some of this hot water?

132
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,773
都给你吧
It's all yours.

133
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:21,447
我没玩过多少次牛仔竞技
I don't rodeo much myself.

134
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:26,564
骑牲口八秒有啥意义？
I mean, what's the point... of ridin' some piece of stock for eight seconds?

135
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:27,997
钱就很有意义
Money's a good point. True enough.

136
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:33,857
那倒没错 要是你没被踩扁的话
If you don't get stomped winnin' it, huh?

137
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:40,301
是啊，我老爸以前是骑牛的
Well, my old man, he was a bull rider.

138
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:42,971
谢谢
Thank you.

139
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:45,509
他那时候还挺有名的
Pretty well-known in his day.

140
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,681
虽然他守口如瓶
Though he kept his secrets to himself.

141
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,254
他没指导过我 也没看过我骑牛
Never taught me a thing, never once come to see me ride.

142
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:07,767
你兄妹有好好养你吧？
Your brother and sister do right by you?

143
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:11,402
他们尽力了，我父母死后
They did the best they could after my folks was gone.

144
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,137
什么都没留
Considerin' they didn't leave us nothin'...

145
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:19,874
只剩一个装了24元的咖啡罐
but $24 in a coffee can.

146
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:22,816
让我念了一年高中
I got me a year of high school.

147
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:26,386
那是在车子的变速器坏掉之前
That was before the transmission went on the pickup.

148
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,029
之后我姐嫁给油工 搬去凯斯柏
And then my sis left. She married a roughneck, moved to Casper.

149
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:36,264
我和我哥，我们
And me and my brother...

150
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:39,694
我们去沃兰附近的牧场工作
we went and got ourselves some work on a ranch up near Worland.

151
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:41,931
到我19岁为止
Till I was 19.

152
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:47,772
他结婚了，没地方给我住
 Then he got married. And no more room for me.

153
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:55,442
那就是…我来这里的原因
That's how come me end up here.

154
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,323
什么？
What?

155
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:11,059
这比你过去两礼拜说的话还多
Man, that's more words than you've spoke in the past two weeks.

156
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:14,967
我一年差不多就说这么多话
Hell, that's the most I've spoke in a year.

157
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:24,113
不过我爸，他是个好牛仔
But my dad, he was a fine roper.

158
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:26,573
他不大玩牛仔竞技
Didn't rodeo much, though.

159
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:28,844
他认为搞牛仔竞技的都是蠢蛋
He thought rodeo cowboys was all fuck-ups.

160
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:33,187
才不是呢！
The hell they are.

161
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:36,413
恩
Well....

162
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:43,727
你看吧
[whooping] There you go.

163
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:48,930
我刺它肚皮 向看台上的妹挥手
I'm spurrin' his guts out! Wavin' to the girls in the stands!

164
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:53,234
它想把我踢上天，却甩不掉我
He's kickin' me to high heaven, but he don't jackboard me! No!

165
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:58,912
我想我爸是对的
I think my dad was right.

166
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:45,491
帐篷看来不大对
Tent don't look right.

167
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:49,998
它又不会跑，随便吧
Well, it ain't goin' nowhere. Let it be.

168
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:53,762
那口琴的声音也不大对
That harmonica don't sound quite right either.

169
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:57,063
因为马儿甩下我时压扁了它
That's 'cause it got kind of flattened when that mare threw me.

170
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:01,743
你不是说它甩不掉你
I thought you said that mare couldn't throw you.

171
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,547
那是它走运
She got lucky.

172
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,551
如果我走运 那口琴就该被压烂
Yeah, well, if I got lucky, that harmonica would've broke in two.

173
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:16,855
我知道我该在最后一天去见你
(Jack) @ I know I shall meet you on that finAl day @

174
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:23,491
全能的主啊，带我走
@ Water-walking Jesus, take me away! @@

175
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:25,624
唱的好
Very good. Oh, yeah.

176
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:30,297
我妈，她相信圣灵降临
My mama, she believes in the Pentecost.

177
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,634
是吗？
Oh, yeah?

178
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,442
圣灵降临到底是什么？
What exactly is the Pentecost?

179
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,015
我父母…他们是美以美教徒
I mean, my folks, they was Methodist.

180
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,177
圣灵降临
The Pentecost.

181
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:44,117
我不知道，我不知道那是什么
I don't know, I don't know what the Pentecost is.

182
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:47,087
我妈没跟我解释过，我猜是…
Mom never explained it to me. I guess it's when the world ends...

183
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:51,912
我们这种人 末日降临时得下地狱
and fellas like you and me, we march off to hell.

184
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,525
那是你的想法
Speak for yourself.

185
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,631
你也许是罪人 不过我可还不是
You may be a sinner, but I ain't yet had the opportunity.

186
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:02,228
谢谢
Thank you.

187
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:06,802
谢谢你
[bottle clinking] (Ennis) Shit!

188
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:12,397
该死，我要去羊群那里了
I'm gonna go up to the sheep now. (Jack) Give 'em hell.

189
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:20,039
不，我……
[slurring] No, I'm....

190
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,558
你根本站不稳，现在去太晚了
You can hardly stand. It's too late to go to them sheep.

191
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,396
你有多一条毯子吗？
Well, you got an extra blanket?

192
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:35,800
我在这窝着，小睡一下
I'll just roll up out here, grab 40 winks...

193
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,237
天一亮就回去
and I'll ride out at first light.

194
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,037
火一灭你就会冻死
You'll freeze your ass off when that fire dies down.

195
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:46,482
这个好
Oh, that's good.

196
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:48,448
你最好睡帐篷里
You're better off sleepin' in the tent.

197
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,011
是啊
Yeah.

198
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:52,184
好吧
All right.

199
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:30,223
艾尼斯
Ennis!

200
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:31,591
怎样？
 What?

201
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:34,562
别打颤了，快进来
Just quit your yammerin' and get in here!

202
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:48,664
你干嘛？
(Ennis) What are you doin'?

203
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:57,359
晚餐见
See you for supper.

204
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,429
好，走了
Yeah. Come on.

205
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,063
快
Come on.

206
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:07,620
这只是一次意外事件
This is a one-shot thing we got goin' on here.

207
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,535
这是我们之间的事
It's nobody's business but ours.

208
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,798
你知道我不是同志
You know I ain't queer.

209
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,575
我也不是
Me, neither.

210
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,118
对不起
I'm sorry.

211
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:44,075
没关系，没关系
It's all right. It's all right.

212
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:46,620
躺下来吧
Lie back. Come on.

213
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:53,930
特斯，你叔叔哈洛德肺炎住院
Twist. Your Uncle Harold's in the hospitAl with pneumonia.

214
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,761
医生说他撑不过去了
Docs don't expect he'll make it.

215
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,135
你妈要我来通知你
Your ma sent me to tell you,

216
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:00,596
我就来了
so here I am.

217
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,702
真是坏消息
Bad news.

218
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:09,011
我想我在山上也无能为力了
There ain't nothin' I can do about it up here, I guess.

219
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:12,314
你下山也帮不上什么忙
There's not much you can do about it down there, neither.

220
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,911
除非你会治肺炎
Not unless you can cure pneumonia.

221
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:55,656
如果我今晚不回去 羊群会乱跑
Them sheep will drift if I don't get back up there tonight!

222
00:35:56,392 --> 00:35:59,225
这种风暴会把你吹跑的
You'll get pitched off your mount in a storm like this.

223
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:01,359
到时你肯定后悔
You'll wish you hadn't tried it!

224
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:04,164
快关上
It's too cold! Close it up!

225
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:16,174
我们现在该怎么办？
What are we supposed to do now, huh?

226
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:17,971
快进去
Get on in there

227
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:21,245
分开我们跟智利人的羊
and untangle 'em Chilean sheep out of ours, I guess.

228
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:26,053
在哪里？该死！
Oh, where is it? Shit!

229
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:32,148
有一半的标志都磨掉了
God, hAlf the goddamn paint brands have wore off!

230
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:36,195
我们尽量设法，保有老板的羊
We gotta try. The least we can do is get the count right for Aguirre.

231
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,925
去他的老板
Fuck Aguirre! Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.

232
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:43,230
万一我们还要靠他赏饭吃呢？
What if we need to work for him again? You think of that?

233
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:44,997
我们得继续做下去
We gotta stick this out, Jack.

234
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:03,652
你不安静点，会把羊又吓跑
You'll run them sheep off again if you don't quiet down.

235
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:42,757
你干嘛？
What are you doing?

236
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,867
老板又来过了
Aguirre came by again.

237
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,335
他说我叔叔没死
Says my uncle didn't die after all.

238
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,329
还说要带羊群下山
Says bring 'em down.

239
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:53,776
为什么？现在才八月中
Bring 'em down, why? It's the middle of August.

240
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,603
说有太平洋风暴要来
Says there's a storm comin', movin' in from the Pacific.

241
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:00,070
会比这个还猛
Worse than this one.

242
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:02,717
那场雪不过才下了一小时
That snow barely stuck an hour. Huh?

243
00:38:05,855 --> 00:38:09,313
那混蛋还要砍我们一个月的钱
Besides, that son of a bitch, he's cuttin' us out a whole month's pay.

244
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:11,388
这不对
It ain't right.

245
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:14,617
那么
Well...

246
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:17,364
我能借你钱 如果你需要钱的话
I can spare you a loan, bud, if you're short on cash.

247
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,431
等到镇上我就拿给你
Give it to you when we get to SignAl.

248
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:25,092
我不需要你的钱 我没穷成那样
I don't need your money, huh? You know, I ain't in the poorhouse. Shit!

249
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:28,035
好吧
All right.

250
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:02,969
该上路了，牛仔
Time to get goin', cowboy.

251
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:19,761
过来，这又不是牛仔竞技
Come here! This ain't no rodeo, cowboy!

252
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:21,260
该死
(Jack) Oh, shit!

253
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,888
艾尼斯…艾尼斯
Ennis. Ennis.

254
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:52,617
艾尼斯…艾尼斯
Ennis. Ennis.

255
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:57,882
过来，你没事了
Come here. You okay? You okay? Yeah.

256
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,745
有些羊根本没跟你们一起上去
Some of these never went up there with you.

257
00:40:53,656 --> 00:40:55,590
我也不想数了
Count ain't what I'd hoped for, neither.

258
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,596
你们这些牧场工，实在不怎样
You ranch stiffs, you ain't never no good.

259
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:17,011
催点油下去
Wanna give it some gas?

260
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:29,124
我真不敢相信 我把衬衫留在上面
I can't believe I left my damn shirt up there.

261
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:32,718
是啊
Yeah.

262
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:37,227
明年夏天你还要来吗？
You gonna do this again next summer?

263
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,931
也许不会吧
Well, maybe not.

264
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,599
我说过 我跟艾玛十一月要结婚
Like I said, me and Alma is gettin' married in November.

265
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:47,997
我会设法找个牧场去做事
So... I'll try to get somethin' on a ranch, I guess.

266
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:50,404
你呢？
And you?

267
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:55,715
可能会去我爸那里，帮忙过冬
Might go up to my daddy's place and give him a hand through the winter.

268
00:41:57,787 --> 00:42:02,240
若没被抓去当兵 我可能会回来
I might be back. If the Army don't get me.

269
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:09,722
我想我们后会有期了
Well, I guess I'll see you around, huh?

270
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,691
是啊
Right.

271
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:25,166
你看什么看！
What the fuck are you lookin' at? Huh?

272
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:36,644
宽恕我们的罪过
(Minister) ''And forgive us our trespasses...

273
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:39,220
如同我们宽恕别人
''as we forgive those who trespass against us.

274
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:42,819
不让我们陷于诱惑 但免于凶恶
(all) ''Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from eviI.

275
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:46,926
国度、权柄、荣耀，永是您的
''For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever.

276
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:48,394
阿门
 Amen.''

277
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:50,661
仅依我被授与的权力
Under the powers vested in me...

278
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,996
我现在宣布你们结为夫妻
I now pronounce you man and wife.

279
00:43:54,337 --> 00:43:55,964
你可以亲吻新娘了
You may kiss the bride.

280
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,172
你若不亲，我就要亲了
And if you don't, I will.

281
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:17,150
你还好吧？
You all right? No.

282
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:26,292
住手！拜托，不要啦！
Stop! No, please don't!

283
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:34,040
我老妈想叫我辞掉工作
(Timmy) My old lady's tryin' to get me to quit this job.

284
00:44:34,377 --> 00:44:35,503
她说我年纪太大了
She says I'm gettin' too old

285
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:38,374
我的背会受不了铲柏油的粗活
to be breakin' my back shovelin' asphAlt.

286
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:40,175
我告诉她我们家的人背很强壮
I told her strong backs

287
00:44:40,316 --> 00:44:42,284
就是意志力太薄弱
and weak minds runs in the family.

288
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:44,677
她不认为那很好笑
[laughing] She didn't think that was too funny.

289
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:47,382
我叫她别把我养太肥
I told her it keeps me fit.

290
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:26,359
进来
Yeah!

291
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:34,836
看看风把谁吹来啦
Well, look what the wind blew in.

292
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:37,069
老板
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.

293
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,770
我在想你今年夏天 需要帮手吗？
I was wonderin' if you was needin' any help this summer.

294
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:42,270
你来这里是浪费时间
You're wastin' your time here.

295
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:49,711
你不需要？断背山上不缺人？
What, you ain't got nothin'? Nothin' up on Brokeback?

296
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,351
我没工作可以给你
I ain't got no work for you.

297
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:04,796
艾尼斯戴尔玛没来过吧？
Ennis Del Mar ain't been around, has he?

298
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,230
你们在山上过的还真逍遥
You boys sure found a way to make the time pass up there.

299
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:17,505
特斯，你们自己快活让狗看羊
Twist...you guys wasn't gettin' paid to leave the dogs

300
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:20,240
钱不是那样赚的
baby-sit the sheep...while you stemmed the rose.

301
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:28,480
现在，给我滚出我的拖车去
Now get the hell out of my trailer.

302
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:15,969
女儿们还好吧？
How my girls doing?

303
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:20,970
还好，珍妮还是在流鼻水
All right. Jenny's still got a runny nose.

304
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:46,696
老公，擦一下小艾玛的鼻子
Ennis, could you wipe Alma Jr.'s nose?

305
00:47:47,203 --> 00:47:49,171
要是我有三只手就可以
If I had three hands, I could.

306
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:52,767
过来，过来
Come here. Come here. Oh!

307
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:21,870
女儿们还好吧？
Girls all right?

308
00:48:22,004 --> 00:48:26,634
还好，珍妮不咳了
Yeah. Jenny stopped her coughin'.

309
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,078
我这个周末该带女儿去城里
I think I should take the girls into town this weekend.

310
00:48:30,212 --> 00:48:33,477
给她们吃点冰淇淋什么的
Get 'em an ice cream. Somethin'.

311
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:39,883
我们不能搬去城里吗？
Can't we move to town?

312
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:44,583
我厌倦这些偏僻的老牧场了
I'm tired of these lonesome old ranches.

313
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:47,755
艾玛跟珍妮根本找不到玩伴
No one's around for Junior to play with.

314
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:50,224
何况我很替珍妮担心
Besides, I'm scared for Jenny...

315
00:48:50,366 --> 00:48:53,233
担心她气喘的问题再发作
scared if she has another one of 'em bad asthma spells.

316
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:56,394
不行，城里的房租太贵了
No, rent in town is too high.

317
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:02,138
瑞文顿洗衣店附近有便宜房子
There's a cheap place in Riverton, over the Laundromat.

318
00:49:03,145 --> 00:49:05,579
我可以把它弄的温暖舒适
I bet I could fix it up reAl nice.

319
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:09,273
你想的话，这里也做得到
I bet you could fix this place up reAl nice if you wanted to.

320
00:49:09,718 --> 00:49:14,212
我知道你也会喜欢的
Ennis. Hmm? I know you'd like it, too.

321
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:20,260
真正的家园，孩子们还有玩伴
ReAl home, other kids for the girls to play with.

322
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:25,964
不像你小时候那么孤单
Not so lonely like you were raised.

323
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:29,798
你也不想那么孤单吧？
You don't want 'em to be so lonely, do you?

324
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:34,939
是啊
Yeah.

325
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:38,437
过来
Come here.

326
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:46,516
这样就不会太孤单了吧？
It ain't so lonely now, is it?

327
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:53,619
你确定女儿都睡啦？
Are you sure the girls are asleep?

328
00:49:53,796 --> 00:49:54,888
确定
 Yeah.

329

该死！

他撑了四秒

我请金宝喝杯啤酒

他是我见过最棒的牛仔小丑

00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,667
我们要不要靠近一点？

@ No one else, can't you see? @

406
00:56:14,135 --> 00:56:17,536
@ No one's gonna love you like me @

407
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,676
@ No one, no one @

408
00:56:30,218 --> 00:56:34,587
@ No one else, can't you see? @

409
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:39,583
@ No one's gonna love you like me @

410
00:56:40,995 --> 00:56:44,988
@ No one, no one @

411
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:51,300

@ I know @

414
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:03,846
@ You felt so sad and blue @@

415
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:35,678
等一等
Oh, wait, hold on.

416
00:57:37,993 --> 00:57:40,393
你不会认为我太猴急了吧？
You don't think I'm too fast, do you?

417
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:42,559
也许我们该踩煞车？
Maybe we should put the brakes on?

418
00:57:43,899 --> 00:57:46,527
不论快慢 我喜欢你要去的方向
Fast or slow, I just like the direction you're goin'.

419
00:57:58,046 --> 00:57:59,240
你还真性急
You are in a hurry.

420
00:57:59,414 --> 00:58:00,608
我爸很性急
My daddy's the hurry.

421
00:58:00,816 --> 00:58:02,716
他会半夜等我开车回家
He expects me home with the car by midnight.

422
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:16,730
过来、过来
Come here, come here.

423
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:18,131

00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:19,798
艾玛在吗？

426
00:58:19,935 --> 00:58:21,368
在，她在调味料区
Yeah, she's in the condiments aisle.

427
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:22,231

428
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,359

429
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:24,470
谢了

430
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,402

431
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:27,735

(Alma Jr.) Excuse us! Yeah, excuse me.

432
00:58:27,909 --> 00:58:30,776
老公？你们跑来干嘛？
Hey, honey. Honey, what are y'all doing here?

433
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,778
事出紧急
Big hurry.

434
00:58:32,914 --> 00:58:35,712
我老板要我去牧场一趟
My boss called and, well, he wants me to go up to the ranch.

435
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:39,754
母牛们突然决定要一起生小牛
Mama. I guess all the heifers must've decided to cAlve at the same time.

436
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:41,381
我把女儿都带来给你
I figured I could drop the girls off with you.

437
00:58:41,883 --> 00:58:46,151
我还有很多事要做，不能离开
Ennis, well... I got a million things I gotta do here before I can leave.

438
00:58:46,294 --> 00:58:47,886
我还有三小时才下班
I don't get off for another three hours.

439
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:49,462
妈妈，我要蜡笔
Mama, I need crayons.

440
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:50,825
现在不行
 Not now, Alma.

441
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:53,593
拜托，你答应今晚带她们的
Ennis, please, you promised you'd take them tonight.

442
00:58:53,735 --> 00:58:56,329
母牛生产，我不能不去
Alma, I can't afford not to be there when the heifers cAlve.

443
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,371
要是出差错，我的工作就完了
Right, it'd be my job if I lose any of 'em.

444
00:58:58,506 --> 00:58:59,905
那我的工作呢？
What about my job?

445
00:59:03,945 --> 00:59:07,315
好，我问我妹能不能照顾她们
Okay, all right, I'll call my sister. I'll see if she can take 'em. All right. All right.

446
00:59:07,315 --> 00:59:10,636
好，你们要乖乖听妈的话喔
You be a good girl for your mama, all right?

447
00:59:11,486 --> 00:59:13,920
我晚上会带点牛排回家
I'll be hAlf the night. Bring home some ground steaks if you think of it.

448
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:14,747

[baby shrieking] Come here.

449
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,323
艾玛，天哪
Oh, Alma, please!

450
00:59:20,695 --> 00:59:22,094
老天
Oh, boy.

451
00:59:22,664 --> 00:59:24,495
蒙洛，真对不起
Okay. Monroe, I'm so sorry.

452
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:26,567
没关系，艾玛
It's okay. It's okay, Alma.

453
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:30,505
我会清干净 叫我妹来带走孩子
I'll clean this up just as soon as I call my sister... to come get the girls.

454
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:33,030
真的，没关系，我来就好
Really, Alma, it's okay. I'll get it.

455
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:34,163
艾玛，跟我来
Alma, come with me.

456
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:35,276
小心脚步
Watch your feet.

457
00:59:35,777 --> 00:59:37,108
艾玛
Alma.

458
00:59:38,647 --> 00:59:39,272
跟我一样
It's just like my hand.

459
00:59:39,414 --> 00:59:41,678
女儿，有个惊喜送给你
(Jack) Honey, got a surprise for you.

460
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,870
嗨

463
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:52,892
120罐？
1 20?

464
00:59:53,261 --> 00:59:54,489
老爸，东西放在哪里？
L.D., where did you put 'em?

465
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:57,497
我就放车子后座
Oh, hell, back seat of the car, where I left 'em.

466
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:00,932
牛仔小子可以去搬
Rodeo can get 'em.

467
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:08,036
老爸 我看得出小巴比长的像谁
L.D., I can Already see who little Bobby looks like.

468
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:09,237
好女儿
Good job, little girl.

469
01:00:09,237 --> 01:00:11,865
他长的真像他爷爷
He's the spittin' image of his grandpa.

470
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:15,047
他长的真像他爷爷，不是吗？
Isn't he just the spittin' image of his grandpa?

471
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:19,747
看看那对眼睛
(Lureen) Look at those eyes.

472
01:00:49,977 --> 01:00:51,035
嗨
Hey.

473
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,014
老婆
(Ennis) Hey, honey.

474
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,623
艾尼斯 你认识一个叫杰克的？
Hey, Ennis, you know somebody, name of Jack?

475
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,627
也许吧，怎么了？
Maybe. Why?

476
01:01:06,768 --> 01:01:09,100
你有张明信片
'Cause you got a postcard. It come generAl delivery.

477
01:01:13,174 --> 01:01:15,506
（朋友好久不见，24日造访）

478
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:17,508
（还在的话捎个讯来，杰克）

479
01:01:21,816 --> 01:01:24,011
他是你同事，还是什么的？
Is he somebody you cowboyed with, or what?

480
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,681
不，杰克，他是玩牛仔竞技的
No, Jack, he rodeos, mostly.

481
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:32,449
我们以前是钓鱼的伙伴
We was fishin' buddies.

482
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:44,570
（当然在）

483
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:14,226
你也可以帮那个着色
(Alma) You can color that one, too.

484
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:16,769
我来给海滩着色
(Alma Jr.) I'll color the beach.

485
01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:23,934
也许我们可以请个保姆
Maybe we could get a baby-sitter.

486
01:02:24,412 --> 01:02:25,310
什么？
Huh?

487
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,739
带你朋友上馆子？
Take your friend to the Knife and Fork?

488
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:32,917
杰克不爱上馆子 我们只会出去
No, Jack ain't the restaurant type.

489
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:38,380
喝一杯，如果他有来的话
We'll more likely just go out and get drunk. That's if he shows.

490
01:02:44,032 --> 01:02:46,626
再吃一口 然后就可以不用吃了
Okay, we take one more bite, and then you're finished with dinner.

491
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:51,169
咬一大口，很好，你可以走了
There, that's a good bite. All right, you're excused.

492
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:53,934

507
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,585

512
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:09,036
艾尼斯？

513
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:11,043
你能不能帮我买条烟？

你要抽烟 我蓝色衬衫口袋里有
If you need smokes, Alma, they're in the top pocket of my blue shirt.

515
01:05:14,182 --> 01:05:15,513
就放卧房
There in the bedroom.

516
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:29,896

01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:36,403
没想到还能有你的消息
Didn't think I'd hear from you again.

519
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:37,605
是啊

520
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,264
我以为你气我打你那拳
I figured you were sore from that punch.

521
01:05:41,009 --> 01:05:43,534
第二年夏天，我回去断背山
Right next summer, I drove back up to Brokeback.

522
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:49,198
找老板谈工作 他说你没回去过 所以我就走了
Talked to Aguirre about a job, and He told me you hadn't been back,so I left.

523
01:05:49,806 --> 01:05:53,667
去德州参加牛仔竞技
Went down to Texas for rodeoin'.

524
01:05:53,777 --> 01:05:55,404
在那认识了萝琳

525
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:59,414
那年才赚2千元，差点饿死
Made $2,000 that year, bull ridin'. Nearly starved.

526
01:06:01,518 --> 01:06:03,816

527
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,317
卖农耕机械的

528
01:06:05,455 --> 01:06:07,184
他当然讨厌我
Of course, he hates my guts.

529
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:13,252
你没被抓去当兵？
And the Army didn't get you? No, too busted up.

530
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:16,929
没，牛仔竞技这行也变样了
And rodeoin' ain't what it was in my daddy's day.

531
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:19,561
趁没残废赶快退出
Got out while I could still walk.

532
01:06:22,072 --> 01:06:25,166
我发誓 我不知道我们还会重逢
Swear to God, I didn't know we was goin' to get into this again.

533
01:06:28,745 --> 01:06:32,305
好吧，我承认 我一路飞车赶来
Yes I did. I red-lined it all the way. I couldn't get here fast enough.

534
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:34,676
你呢？
What about you? .

535
01:06:36,086 --> 01:06:40,390
我？我不知道
Me? I don't know I don't know.

536
01:06:48,098 --> 01:06:50,328
断背山撮合了我们，对吧
OId Brokeback got us good, don't it?

537
01:06:55,972 --> 01:06:57,701
我们现在该怎样？
What are we gonna do now?

538
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:03,713
我想可能不能怎样吧
I doubt there's nothin' we can do.

539
01:07:08,685 --> 01:07:11,153
我被困在这里
So now I'm stuck with what I got here.

540
01:07:15,592 --> 01:07:18,561
只能努力过生活
Makin' a livin' is about all I got time for now.

541
01:07:44,254 --> 01:07:46,779
我跟杰克要去山上一两天
Well, me and Jack is headed up the mountain for a day or two.

542
01:07:46,956 --> 01:07:48,787
去钓个鱼
Do ourselves a little fishin'.

543
01:07:56,566 --> 01:07:58,966
你跟你朋友可以进来喝杯咖啡
You know, your friend could come inside, have a cup of coffee.

544
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:01,569
他是从德州来的
Well, he's from Texas.

545
01:08:02,972 --> 01:08:04,667
德州人不喝咖啡吗？
Texans don't drink coffee?

546
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,545
你确定那个领班不会炒了你？
You sure that foreman won't fire you for takin' off?

547
01:08:16,686 --> 01:08:18,586
那个领班，他欠我的
You know, that foreman, he owes me.

548
01:08:18,755 --> 01:08:21,451
我去年耶诞还冒着暴风雪上工
I worked through a blizzard last Christmas. You remember that?

549
01:08:22,692 --> 01:08:24,853
何况我只去两天
Besides, I'll only be a couple of days.

550
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:31,389
带条鱼给我，爸爸，一条大鱼
Bring fish, Daddy. A big, big one!

551
01:08:32,769 --> 01:08:34,168
过来
Come here.

552
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:38,767
去吧
Come here.

553
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:47,441
过来
Come here.

554
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:51,986
最迟周日见
See you Sunday, latest.

555
01:09:03,066 --> 01:09:04,434
我饿坏了，要不要吃点东西？
I'm starvin'. Want to get somethin' to eat?

556
01:09:04,434 --> 01:09:05,458
好
Yup.

557
01:09:34,297 --> 01:09:35,924
看谁先下水！
(Ennis) Last one in!

558
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:56,717
天堂里有什么有趣的事吗？
Is there anything interestin' up there in heaven?

559
01:09:57,954 --> 01:10:00,388
我只是做个感谢的祈祷
Well, I was just sending up a prayer of thanks.

560
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,223
谢什么？
For what?

561
01:10:04,561 --> 01:10:06,552
感谢你没带口琴来
For you forgettin' to bring that harmonica.

562
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,491
我很享受这份宁静祥和
I'm enjoying the peace and quiet.

563
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,667
你知道可以就像这样 直到永远
You know it could be like this, just like this, Always.

564
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:19,935
是吗？你怎么知道？
Yeah? How do you figure that?

565
01:10:24,213 --> 01:10:27,842
如果你我去某个地方 弄个小牧场
What if you and me had a little ranch somewhere...

566
01:10:28,918 --> 01:10:32,354
养点牛 那种人生应该会很美好
a little cow-and-cAlf operation? It'd be a sweet life.

567
01:10:32,722 --> 01:10:34,917
去他的，萝琳的老爸
I mean, hell, Lureen's old man...

568
01:10:35,058 --> 01:10:36,326
他很想给我一笔钱打发我
you bet he'd give me a down payment to get lost.

569
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:39,419
他多少提过这件事
I mean, he more or less Already said it.

570
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:47,431
不…我跟你说 不会是那样的
No, I... I told you it ain't gonna be that way.

571
01:10:50,106 --> 01:10:54,344
你有老婆孩子
You know... you got your wife and baby in Texas.

572
01:10:54,344 --> 01:10:58,781
在德州 我在瑞文顿有我的人生
You know, I got my life in Riverton.

573
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:00,974
是吗？
Is that so?

574
01:11:02,452 --> 01:11:04,181
你跟艾玛，那就算人生了？
You and Alma, that's a life?

575
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:07,085
不准你批评艾玛 这不是她的错
Now you shut up about Alma.This ain't her fault.

576
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:11,025
最重要的是
The bottom line is...

577
01:11:12,428 --> 01:11:14,498
我们拥有彼此，而这件事
we're around each other...

578
01:11:14,498 --> 01:11:17,900
再度让我们聚首
and this thing grabs hold of us again...

579
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:23,095
换个错误的地点和时间
in the wrong place... in the wrong time...

580
01:11:23,539 --> 01:11:24,972
我们就死定了
and we're dead.

581
01:11:27,577 --> 01:11:28,669
我告诉你
I tell you...

582
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:33,378
以前我家乡有两个老家伙
there were these two old guys ranched up together down home.

583
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:39,616
厄尔和瑞奇 他们是镇上的笑柄
(Ennis) Earl and Rich. And they was a joke in town...

584
01:11:39,756 --> 01:11:40,916
尽管他们…
even though they

585
01:11:41,057 --> 01:11:42,820
他们是很坚毅的老鸟
 were pretty tough old birds.

586
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:53,700
总之厄尔死在灌溉壕沟里
Anyway, they found Earl dead... in an irrigation ditch.

587
01:11:55,238 --> 01:11:57,874
有人拿铁撬打昏他，拖着他
They took a tire iron to him, spurred him up...

588
01:11:57,874 --> 01:12:01,642
绑住他的小弟拖到拉断为止
and drug him around by his dick till it pulled off.

589
01:12:03,446 --> 01:12:05,004
你亲眼看到了？
You seen this?

590
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:08,348
对，我当时九岁
 Yeah, I was what? Nine years old.

591
01:12:10,186 --> 01:12:13,451
我爸坚持要带我跟我哥去看
(Ennis) My daddy, he made sure me and my brother seen it.

592
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,488
就我所知，他也有份
Hell, for all I know, he done the job.

593
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:26,934
两个男人住在一起，不可能
Two guys living together? No way.

594
01:12:28,504 --> 01:12:30,734
我们现在可以偶尔碰头
Now, we can get together once in a while...

595
01:12:30,873 --> 01:12:33,364
找个偏僻的地方就行，不过…
way the hell out in the middle of nowhere, but....

596
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:40,110
偶尔？每四年一次？
''Once in a while.'' Every four fucking years?

597
01:12:40,316 --> 01:12:44,514
如果你无法改变，就得忍受它
Well, if you can't fix it, Jack, you gotta stand it.

598
01:12:47,557 --> 01:12:48,956
忍多久？
For how long?

599
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:53,056
直到我们驯服它为止
(Ennis) As long as we can ride it.

600
01:12:58,501 --> 01:13:01,732
这是匹无法驾驭的马
There ain't no reins on this one.

601
01:13:17,687 --> 01:13:19,780
晚餐时间到了，你要去哪？
(Ennis) It's nearly suppertime. Where the hell do you think you're going?

602
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:20,751
去上班
(Alma) To work!

603
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,221
我以为你今天休假
I thought you had the day off!

604
01:13:22,358 --> 01:13:23,290
你搞错了
Well, you thought wrong!

605
01:13:23,426 --> 01:13:24,393
女儿要吃饭
The girls need to be fed.

606
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:25,755
你自己搞定吧
Well, you take care of it!

607
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:28,796
艾玛！艾玛！
Alma! Alma!

608
01:13:28,931 --> 01:13:30,262
晚餐在炉子上
Supper's on the stove!

609
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:32,264
你不上菜没人会吃
No one's eatin' unless you're servin' it!

610
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:34,802
我已经答应要加班了
I Already promised I'd take the extra shift!

611
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:36,768
告诉他们你弄错了
Fucking tell 'em you made a mistake, then!

612
01:13:37,073 --> 01:13:39,906
该死，艾玛！
God damn it, Alma! Alma!

613
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:51,152
你们需要人帮忙推吗？
You girls need a push or somethin'?

614
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:52,915
不用
(both) No.

615
01:14:02,165 --> 01:14:04,030
你们听 凯迪拉克都没这种声音
(Jack) Listen to her purr, gentlemen!You ain't gonna get that with your Caddy!

616
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,069
我提过它的功能 让我展示一下
I told you what she could do, and now let me show you.

617
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:15,970
那家伙以前不是骑牛的吗？
(farmer) Say, didn't that pissant used to ride the bulls?

618
01:14:17,947 --> 01:14:19,539
他只是“尝试”过
He used to try.

619
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:54,713
老婆 你有看到我蓝色夹克吗？
[door closing] Honey, have you seen my blue parka?

620
01:14:56,018 --> 01:14:57,576
我上次看到时，是你穿着它
(Lureen) Last time I seen it, you was in it...

621
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,449
那天刚好有大风雪来袭
day we had that big ice storm.

622
01:15:01,157 --> 01:15:03,250
我发誓我在这看过它
Well, could have sworn I seen it in here.

623
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:06,694
你知道
You know...

624
01:15:07,563 --> 01:15:09,190
你这些年老是去怀俄明
you've been going up to Wyoming all these years.

625
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:12,301
为什么 你朋友不能来德州钓鱼？
Why can't your buddy come down here to Texas and fish?

626
01:15:12,602 --> 01:15:14,934
因为大角山不在德州
Because the Bighorn Mountains ain't in Texas.

627
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:18,431
我也不认为他的破车 能开这么远
And I don't think that his pickup could make it down here, anyway.

628
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:21,338
新型设备这周会到，记得吗？
(Lureen) New model comin' in this week, remember?

629
01:15:21,844 --> 01:15:24,278
你是我们的最佳业务员
You're the best combine salesman we got.

630
01:15:25,248 --> 01:15:27,216
你才是超级业务员
You're the only combine salesman, in fact.

631
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:30,046
我一周内就回来，除非我冻死
Yeah, I'll be back in a week. That is, unless I freeze to death...

632
01:15:30,186 --> 01:15:31,676
没找到夹克 我就真的会冻死了
and I'll freeze if I don't find that parka.

633
01:15:31,821 --> 01:15:33,789
我没拿你的臭夹克
Well, I don't have your goddamn parka.

634
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:36,424
你掉东西时的脾气比儿子还差
You know, you're worse than Bobby when it comes to losin' stuff.

635
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:40,553
说到儿子，你跟学校联络了？
Well, speakin' of Bobby, did you call his school... about gettin' him a tutor?

636
01:15:41,797 --> 01:15:42,957
我以为你会联络
I thought you were gonna call.

637
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:44,123
我太会抱怨了
I complain too much.

638
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:46,360
老师不喜欢我，该你联络了
That teacher don't like me. Right. Now it's your turn.

639
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:47,161
好吧
 Okay, fine,

640
01:15:47,303 --> 01:15:48,861
我晚点会联络
so I'll call later.

641
01:15:52,141 --> 01:15:53,199
好
Right. Fine.

642
01:15:54,677 --> 01:15:58,773
拜，我还有14小时的车要开呢
Goodbye. (Jack) Got 1 4 hours of driving ahead of me.

643
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:00,746
看吧，这似乎不大公平
See now, it don't seem fair...

644
01:16:00,883 --> 01:16:03,010
你一年去那里两三趟
you goin' up there two, three times a year...

645
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:05,120
他却从未来过这里
with him never comin' down here.

646
01:16:22,038 --> 01:16:25,530
电力公司有缺，薪水可能不错
Ennis, they got an opening over at the power company. Might be good pay.

647
01:16:25,942 --> 01:16:29,207
我笨手笨脚的 搞不好会被电死
Well, as clumsy as I am, I'd probably get electrocuted.

648
01:16:29,345 --> 01:16:31,540
爸，下周末教会野餐
(Alma Jr.) Daddy, the church picnic's next weekend.

649
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:33,672
到时你钓鱼回来了吗？
Will you be back from fishing by next weekend?

650
01:16:33,816 --> 01:16:35,750
爸，拜托嘛
[grunts] Please, Daddy? Please!

651
01:16:35,885 --> 01:16:38,012
好吧，只要不逼我唱歌就去
Well, all right, as long as I don't have to sing.

652
01:16:38,221 --> 01:16:41,019
爸爸，谢谢你
Daddy. Thank you.

653
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,955
你是不是忘了什么？
You forgettin' somethin'?

654
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:21,754
你迟到了
(Jack) You're late.

655
01:17:22,531 --> 01:17:23,862
你看我带了什么来
(Ennis) Look what I brought.

656
01:17:24,066 --> 01:17:25,363
豆子？
beans.

657
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:29,395
是啊，我要像往日一样煮豆子
This way.

658
01:17:43,686 --> 01:17:46,177
很好，我没帮你了
There you go! No hands!

659
01:17:46,322 --> 01:17:48,415
全是你在开呢，巴比
(Jack) It's all yours, buddy! It's all yours.

660
01:17:53,062 --> 01:17:55,496
来啊、来啊
Come on, come on.

661
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:11,543
今天是周六夜
It's Saturday night,

662
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,013
我们可以打扮一下去教堂晃晃
and head on over to the church sociAl.

663
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:18,413
去给那群人折磨？
That fire and brimstone crowd?

664
01:18:21,757 --> 01:18:23,349
我觉得应该不错
I think it'd be nice.

665
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:39,401
艾尼斯
Ennis.

666
01:18:40,176 --> 01:18:40,767
我们过得
As far behind as we are on the bills...

667
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,241
这么入不敷出的
it makes me nervous

668
01:18:42,478 --> 01:18:45,038
没避孕让我很紧张
not to take no precaution.

669
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:50,510
如果你不想再生孩子
If you don't want no more of my kids...

670
01:18:51,287 --> 01:18:53,551
我很乐意放过你
I'll be happy to leave you alone.

671
01:18:57,026 --> 01:19:00,223
我愿意生，如果你愿意养的话
I'd have 'em, if you'd support 'em.

672
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:19,207
两名小孩的监护权
(judge) Custody of the two minor chiIdren...

673
01:19:19,348 --> 01:19:23,284
小艾玛和珍妮归原告
Alma Del Mar Jr. and Jennifer Del Mar... is awarded to plaintiff.

674
01:19:23,619 --> 01:19:25,849
被告必须支付原告养育费用
Defendant is ordered to pay chiId support to plaintiff...

675
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:27,888
每个小孩每月125元
in the sum of $1 25 per month for each of the minor chiIdren...

676
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:33,393
直到她们满18岁成年为止
untiI they reach the age of 18 years.

677
01:19:33,762 --> 01:19:35,093
戴尔玛夫妇离婚获准
Del Mar divorce granted,

678
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:38,223
1975年11月6日
 this sixth day of November, 1975.

679
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:46,635
（进入怀俄明州）

680
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:00,179
上车吧
In you go.

681
01:20:11,267 --> 01:20:12,427
你来这干嘛？
What are you doin' here, huh?

682
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:17,328
我收到你离婚的信息了
I got your message about the divorce.

683
01:20:18,174 --> 01:20:19,232
过来
Come here.

684
01:20:21,544 --> 01:20:22,806
这位是杰克
Well, this here's Jack.

685
01:20:23,078 --> 01:20:26,343
杰克，我女儿小艾玛和珍妮
Jack, these are my little girls.There's Alma Jr. and Jenny. Hi.

686
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:29,076
快打招呼，女儿
Say hi, girls. (both) Hi.

687
01:20:35,424 --> 01:20:38,393
我收到你说你离婚的卡片
I got your card that the divorce came through.

688
01:20:38,527 --> 01:20:39,494
是啊
Yeah.

689
01:20:39,662 --> 01:20:41,926
所以…我就来了
So here I am.

690
01:20:42,665 --> 01:20:46,167
我沿路问很多人你搬去哪了
I had to ask about 10 different people in Riverton... where you had moved to.

691
01:20:48,704 --> 01:20:50,103
这个嘛
En……

692
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:54,174
我以为那代表你…
I guess, I thought that this means you....

693
01:20:55,911 --> 01:21:02,339
杰克，我不知道该说什么
No, Jack, I don't know what to say.

694
01:21:03,886 --> 01:21:06,320
这周末我女儿过来跟我过
See, I got the girls this weekend and....

695
01:21:07,723 --> 01:21:11,560
我相信你明白我有多抱歉
Jeez, I.... I'm sure as hell sorry. You know I am.

696
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,498
我一个月才能见她们一次
See, I only get them once a month,

697
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:17,556
我上个月错过了
and I missed last month.

698
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,830
所以我…因为我去赶集畜牲
So I just.... Because of the roundup.

699
01:21:22,137 --> 01:21:23,365
所以
So....

700
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:26,567
这个嘛
Well....

701
01:21:27,243 --> 01:21:28,369
是啊，好吧
Yeah, all right.

702
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:31,339
杰克
Jack.

703
01:21:33,315 --> 01:21:35,306
那我下个月再来看你了
I'll see you next month, then.

704
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:26,758
（墨西哥边界，68英里）

705
01:23:01,804 --> 01:23:03,135
先生？
[speaks Spanish]

706
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:28,218
来了
(Lureen) Comin' up.

707
01:23:30,366 --> 01:23:34,632
上桌了
Here we go. Here we are!

708
01:23:38,674 --> 01:23:39,800
等等，牛仔
Whoa there, Rodeo.

709
01:23:39,975 --> 01:23:42,136
老丈人在此，我来切
The stud duck do the carvin' around here.

710
01:23:43,011 --> 01:23:47,107
当然，我只是…想帮你省麻烦
You bet, LD. I was just saving you the trouble.

711
01:23:54,156 --> 01:23:55,384
巴比
Bobby,

712
01:23:55,524 --> 01:23:58,391
你不吃晚餐，我就关掉电视
if you don't eat your dinner.I'm gonna have to turn off that television.

713
01:23:58,527 --> 01:23:59,619
为什么？
Why, Mama?

714
01:23:59,795 --> 01:24:02,389
反正接下来两周我都要吃剩菜
I'm gonna be eating this food for the next two weeks.

715
01:24:02,598 --> 01:24:04,156
你听见你妈的话了
Hey, you heard your mama.

716
01:24:06,635 --> 01:24:09,297
吃完饭，你才能看球赛
You finish your meAl, and then you can watch the game.

717
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,039
爸？
Daddy?

718
01:24:26,054 --> 01:24:27,351
爸？
Daddy.

719
01:24:29,091 --> 01:24:32,754
我们又不是用眼睛吃饭
Hell, we don't eat with our eyes.

720
01:24:33,028 --> 01:24:36,030
你希望你儿子长大成人吧？
(L.D.) You want your boy to grow up... to be a man, don't you, Daughter?

721
01:24:36,598 --> 01:24:38,759
男生就该看足球
[clearing throat] Boys should watch football.

722
01:24:43,005 --> 01:24:45,838
除非他吃完晚饭
Not untiI he finishes eating the meAl...

723
01:24:46,475 --> 01:24:49,467
那是他妈妈花了三小时准备的
that his mama took three hours to fix.

724
01:24:59,955 --> 01:25:02,185
你给我坐下，混帐东西
Now you sit down, you old son of a bitch!

725
01:25:05,461 --> 01:25:08,191
这里是我家，这是我的小孩
This is my house, this is my chiId...

726
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:09,592
而你是我的客人
and you are my guest. Now you sit down...

727
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:13,064
你坐好，免得我动手赶人
before I knock your ignorant ass into next week.

728
01:26:04,219 --> 01:26:08,087
爸，说说你骑野马的事吧
Daddy, tell about when you rode broncs in the rodeo.

729
01:26:10,092 --> 01:26:12,151
那故事很短
Well, that's a short story, honey.

730
01:26:12,294 --> 01:26:14,728
那才三秒，我骑在野马背上
It was only about three seconds I was on that bronc.

731
01:26:16,532 --> 01:26:19,092
接着我就飞过空中
The next thing I knew, I was flying through the air...

732
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:21,361
可是我不是天使
only I was no angel

733
01:26:21,503 --> 01:26:22,936
不像你跟珍妮一样
like you and Jenny here.

734
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:24,771
我没有翅膀
I didn't have no wings.

735
01:26:27,876 --> 01:26:31,175
那就是我的驯马生涯
And that's the story of my saddle bronc career.

736
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:55,594
好了
There you go.

737
01:27:03,378 --> 01:27:05,005
你该再婚的，艾尼斯
You ought to get married again, Ennis.

738
01:27:05,213 --> 01:27:07,909
我跟女儿们都担心你一个人
Me and the girls worry about you bein' alone so much.

739
01:27:09,685 --> 01:27:11,277
一朝被蛇咬…
Well, once burned....

740
01:27:15,724 --> 01:27:17,954
你还跟杰克去钓鱼吗？
You still go fishing with Jack Twist?

741
01:27:20,162 --> 01:27:21,857
不常
Not often.

742
01:27:25,667 --> 01:27:28,636
我曾怀疑你为何从不带鱼回家
You know, I used to wonder how come you never brought any trouts home.

743
01:27:29,338 --> 01:27:30,703
你老说你钓了很多
You Always said you caught plenty...

744
01:27:30,839 --> 01:27:33,433
而你也知道我跟女儿都爱吃鱼
and you know how me and the girls like fish.

745
01:27:36,311 --> 01:27:38,142
所以有一晚，我打开你的鱼箱
So, one night, I got your creel case open...

746
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,840
就在你们某次钓鱼之前
night before you went on one of your little trips.

747
01:27:43,452 --> 01:27:46,785
五年了，价格标签却还在
Price tag still on it after five years.

748
01:27:47,022 --> 01:27:49,490
而我在另一端绑了一个字条
And I tied a note to the end of the line.

749
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:54,587
上面写“老公，带点鱼回家”
It said, ''Hello, Ennis, bring some fish home. Love, Alma.''

750
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:56,891
后来你回家
And then you come back lookin' all perky...

751
01:27:57,299 --> 01:27:59,835
神采奕奕的 说你抓到一堆鳟鱼
and said you caught a bunch of brownies and you ate them up.

752
01:27:59,835 --> 01:28:02,995
还把它们都吃了，你记得吗？
Do you remember?

753
01:28:05,474 --> 01:28:08,671
我去检查箱子，我的字条还在
I looked in that case first chance I got... and there was my note still tied there.

754
01:28:09,044 --> 01:28:10,841
标签线完全没碰过水
That line hadn't touched water in its life.

755
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:12,241
那不代表什么
That don't mean nothing, Alma.

756
01:28:12,981 --> 01:28:14,676
别想再骗我了
Don't try and fool me no more, Ennis.

757
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:19,150
我知道那代表什么，那个杰克
I know what that means. Jack Twist.

758
01:28:19,588 --> 01:28:20,714
艾玛
Alma.

759
01:28:22,357 --> 01:28:26,028
龌龊杰克！你们才不是去钓鱼
Jack ''Nasty''!You didn't go up there to fish.

760
01:28:26,028 --> 01:28:26,790
你跟他
You and him--

761
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:29,192
你给我听着，你啥都不知道
Now you listen to me, you don't know nothing about it

762
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:30,855
我要叫蒙洛了
[crying] I'm going to yell for Monroe.

763
01:28:30,999 --> 01:28:32,466
你叫啊 我会让他好看
You do it and I'll make you eat the fucking floor.

764
01:28:32,601 --> 01:28:33,829
出去！
Get out!

765
01:28:33,969 --> 01:28:35,662
出去！出去！你也一样
And you, too! Get out! Get out!

766
01:28:35,804 --> 01:28:40,607
出去！滚出我家！ 你听见了！滚出去！
Get out of my house, Ennis Del Mar! You hear me? You get out!

767
01:28:40,742 --> 01:28:41,606
爸？
Daddy?

768
01:28:41,843 --> 01:28:42,935
出去！
[dishware shattering]

769
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:44,509
艾玛？你还好吧？
Alma?

770
01:28:46,948 --> 01:28:47,972
拜，爸
(Jenny) Bye, Daddy!

771
01:28:49,818 --> 01:28:51,012
拜！
(Alma Jr.) Bye.

772
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:07,358
混蛋，走路要看路
Hey, asshole, watch where you're goin'!

773
01:29:10,172 --> 01:29:11,230
搞什么！老天
Jesus. What....Jesus....

774
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:14,508
你这个混帐东西
(driver) You stupid fuck!

775
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:17,677
该死的混蛋
God damn!

776
01:29:20,849 --> 01:29:25,252
去你妈的！你该死！
God. God damn.Oh, fuck!

777
01:29:31,727 --> 01:29:32,921
该死！
Damn it!

778
01:30:19,908 --> 01:30:21,273
我是说
All I'm sayin' is

779
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:24,977
那有什么意思？就算没缴税
what's the point of making it?If the taxes don't get it,

780
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,908
通货膨胀也会吃光利润
the inflation will eat it all up.

781
01:30:33,188 --> 01:30:35,247
你该看萝琳算钱的样子
You should see Lureen punchin' numbers in her adding machine.

782
01:30:35,757 --> 01:30:38,627
她打着计算机，找寻额外的0
Hunting for extra zeros,

783
01:30:38,627 --> 01:30:39,695
她的眼睛越眯越小
her eyes gettin' smaller and smaller.

784
01:30:39,695 --> 01:30:43,120
就像看一只兔子
It's like watchin' a rabbit tryin' to...

785
01:30:43,732 --> 01:30:46,200
想躲进蛇洞里避难似的
squeeze into a snake hole with a coyote on its taiI.

786
01:30:46,568 --> 01:30:49,036
那真是上流社会的娱乐
That's some high class entertainment, if you ask me.

787
01:30:51,373 --> 01:30:52,533
一切都很值得
For what it's worth.

788
01:30:57,179 --> 01:30:59,943
你跟萝琳，你们正常吧？
You and Lureen, it's normAl and all?

789
01:31:03,351 --> 01:31:04,511
当然
Sure.

790
01:31:06,688 --> 01:31:08,315
她没起过疑心？
She don't ever suspect?

791
01:31:19,201 --> 01:31:20,600
你有没有过一种感觉
You ever get the feelin'...

792
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,337
我不知道
I don't know...

793
01:31:23,772 --> 01:31:27,799
当你进城，有人看着你
when you're in town... and someone looks at you...

794
01:31:28,176 --> 01:31:31,270
用怀疑的眼光 好像他知情似的
suspicious, like he knows.

795
01:31:31,447 --> 01:31:33,748
然后你走在人行道上
Then you go out on the pavement and everyone's lookin' at you...

796
01:31:33,748 --> 01:31:36,410
大家看你的眼光 好像啥都知道
like they all know, too?

797
01:31:42,324 --> 01:31:44,019
也许你该离开那里了
Well, maybe you ought to get out of there, you know?

798
01:31:47,362 --> 01:31:50,058
找个不一样的地方 也许德州？
Find yourself someplace different, maybe Texas.

799
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:52,932
德州？
Texas?

800
01:31:54,569 --> 01:31:56,161
当然，也许你能说服艾玛
Sure, and maybe you can convince Alma...

801
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:58,329
让你跟萝琳认养我女儿
to let you and Lureen adopt the girls.

802
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:00,303
然后我们就能住一起，养羊
Then we could just live together, herdin' sheep.

803
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:02,173
你那有钱的岳父
And it'll rain money from L.D. Newsome...

804
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:04,540
会把钱给我们 溪里流着威士忌
and whiskey will flow in the streams.

805
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:05,941
杰克，那太聪明了
Jack, that's reAl smart.

806
01:32:06,081 --> 01:32:07,571
你去死吧，艾尼斯
Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar.

807
01:32:07,849 --> 01:32:10,317
你想悲惨度日，那就请便
You wanna live your miserable fucking life? Then go right ahead.

808
01:32:10,518 --> 01:32:11,507
好
Fine.

809
01:32:11,653 --> 01:32:12,312
我只是说出我的想法
 I was just thinkin' out loud.

810
01:32:12,454 --> 01:32:13,978
是啊，你想的还真周到
Yup, you're a reAl thinker there. God damn....

811
01:32:14,289 --> 01:32:19,793
唬烂杰克，事事都想得周全
Jack fucking Twist. Got it all figured out, ain't he?

812
01:32:41,049 --> 01:32:43,745
我刚下班，要跳舞吗？
Just finished my shift. Wanna dance?

813
01:32:43,885 --> 01:32:44,909
我正要去…
I was on my way to the--

814
01:32:45,053 --> 01:32:47,419
我是凯希，凯希卡芮
I'm Cassie. Cassie Cartwright.

815
01:32:48,323 --> 01:32:51,019
艾尼斯戴尔玛
Ennis. Del Mar.

816
01:33:19,955 --> 01:33:21,582
我不要再跳舞了
No more dancin' for me, I hope.

817
01:33:22,457 --> 01:33:23,549
你安全了
You're safe.

818
01:33:23,692 --> 01:33:24,124
什么？
Yeah?

819
01:33:24,259 --> 01:33:25,317
我的脚痛
My feet hurt. H

820
01:33:26,027 --> 01:33:26,925
工作很辛苦啊？
ard work, is it?

821
01:33:27,062 --> 01:33:31,522
是啊，像你这种醉鬼一直点酒
Yeah, drunks like you demanding beer after beer...

822
01:33:31,733 --> 01:33:34,793
又抽烟，真令人讨厌
smokin'. Gets tiresome.

823
01:33:36,371 --> 01:33:38,669
你是做什么的，艾尼斯？
What do you do, Ennis Del Mar?

824
01:33:40,642 --> 01:33:42,974
我今早还在阉牛呢
Well, earlier today, I was castrating cAlves.

825
01:33:48,316 --> 01:33:49,340
你干嘛？
What are you doing?

826
01:33:50,352 --> 01:33:52,718
想要人给我按摩一下脚，笨蛋
Trying to get a foot rub, dummy.

827
01:33:56,558 --> 01:34:00,927
好吧…那样行吗？
All right. That good?

828
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:25,283
我在南美以美大学加入姊妹会
And then I pledged Tri Delt at SMU.

829
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:28,878
从未想过最后会到这个小地方
And I sure never thought... I'd end up in a poky little place like ChiIdress.

830
01:34:29,124 --> 01:34:31,888
然后我在农工大学认识老朗代
Then I met old Randall here at an Aggie game...

831
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:34,290
他主修畜牧，所以我们到过这
and he was an animAl husbandry major.

832
01:34:34,429 --> 01:34:40,491
来了一个月，他去牧场做工头
So we've been here for a month and he got the foreman job over at Roy Taylor's ranch. Like it or not, here I am!

833
01:34:40,635 --> 01:34:44,298
无论如何，我就在这里了！
Was you Tri Delt? I was Kappa Phi myself.

834
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,638
你参加过姊妹会？ 那是我死对头 虽然我们不大像姊妹会的
Well, even though we ain't quite sorority sisters...

835
01:34:48,777 --> 01:34:50,904
不过我们得把彼此当舞伴
we just may have to dance with ourselves, Lureen.

836
01:34:51,046 --> 01:34:53,879
我们的丈夫都对跳舞不感兴趣
Our husbands ain't the least bit interested in dancin'.

837
01:34:54,082 --> 01:34:55,982
他们甚至连节奏感都没有
They ain't got a smidgen of rhythm between them.

838
01:34:56,117 --> 01:34:58,642
很好笑，对吧？
It's funny, isn't it?

839
01:34:58,787 --> 01:35:02,052
丈夫通常都不跟老婆跳舞
Husbands don't never seem to wanna dance with their wives.

840
01:35:02,857 --> 01:35:04,484
你想那是为什么呢？
Why do you think that is, Jack?

841
01:35:04,659 --> 01:35:06,354
我从来没想过这点
I don't know, I never give it any thought.

842
01:35:08,096 --> 01:35:09,290
要跳舞吗？
Wanna dance?

843
01:35:10,832 --> 01:35:11,992
好，谢谢  你介意吗？
Yes, thank you. (Jack) Do you mind?

844
01:35:12,868 --> 01:35:15,735
当然不  去吧
No, it's all right. Go ahead. All right.

845
01:35:17,372 --> 01:35:19,602
谢谢你邀我跳舞
(LaShawn) Pardon us. Thank you for asking me to dance with you.

846
01:35:19,741 --> 01:35:22,232
我很感激，真的
I really appreciate that. Randall never does.

847
01:35:22,577 --> 01:35:25,713
你跟萝琳能碰巧遇见我们真好
Last time I did, I think it was our wedding. It's a good thing you and Lureen happened along when you did

848
01:35:25,713 --> 01:35:30,082
不然我们还蹲在路边呢
or else we'd still be stuck on the side of the road... in that darn pickup.

849
01:35:30,752 --> 01:35:33,516
我跟朗代说该买车 他老是不听
I told Randall we ought to take the car. Of course, he'd never listen to me.

850
01:35:33,655 --> 01:35:36,055
他就是不听我的 好像耳聋似的
[laughing] He wouldn't listen to me if he was goin' deaf tomorrow.

851
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:41,057
我跟他说 他根本修不好那辆破车
I told him it'd take more than chewing gum and baling wire... to fix that pickup.

852
01:35:41,496 --> 01:35:44,021
他本来就不会修车
Well, he's never been very mechanicAl, though.

853
01:35:46,034 --> 01:35:47,899
过来
Come over here and ask....

854
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:58,812
你注意到 女人参加派对前会扑粉
You ever notice how a woman will powder her nose... before she goes to a party?

855
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,646
派对结束后又会再扑粉吗？
And then she'll powder it again once the party's over.

856
01:36:03,218 --> 01:36:05,516
都要回家睡觉了还扑什么粉？
I mean, why powder your nose just to go home and go to bed?

857
01:36:06,855 --> 01:36:10,120
不知，就算我想知道
Don't know. Even if I wanted to know...

858
01:36:10,258 --> 01:36:12,920
我也插不上我老婆的话去问
I couldn't get a word in with Lashawn long enough to ask.

859
01:36:13,528 --> 01:36:15,325
女人讲话就像连珠炮
Woman talks a blue streak.

860
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:17,354
真有元气的女人
Lively little gAl.

861
01:36:24,906 --> 01:36:30,333
你喜欢帮洛伊干活吗？ 他很可靠 是啊，他是个好人
You'll like working for Roy Taylor. He's solid, Roy. Yeah, Roy. He's a good old boy.

862
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:38,685
他在坎普湖畔有栋小木屋
He's got a little cabin down on Lake Kemp.

863
01:36:39,888 --> 01:36:41,719
一间小房子、一艘小船
Got a crappie house, little boat.

864
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:44,724
还说我想用时随时都能用
Said I could use it whenever I want.

865
01:36:49,063 --> 01:36:50,758
我们该找个周末去一趟
We ought to go down there some weekend.

866
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:55,060
喝点威士忌、钓个鱼
Drink a little whiskey, fish some.

867
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:58,967
远离喧嚣，你知道的
Get away, you know?

868
01:37:02,143 --> 01:37:03,508
那是在大学毕业后
(LaShawn) That was right out of SMU.

869
01:37:03,645 --> 01:37:06,273
我选择在北达拉斯找工作
I could've had my pick of pretty much any job in North Dallas.

870
01:37:06,414 --> 01:37:07,883
所以我选了尼曼马可斯 那真糟
So my pick was Neiman Marcus, which was a disaster...

871
01:37:07,883 --> 01:37:11,385
因为只要有漂亮衣服
because, honey, where clothes is concerned, I got no resistance.

872
01:37:11,519 --> 01:37:14,613
我就无法抗拒，花的比赚的多
I was spending more than I made. More than Randall ever will make.

873
01:37:14,756 --> 01:37:17,384
比朗代赚的还多 那时我们来此
We come out here... thinkin' that ranchin' was still big hats and Marlboros.

874
01:37:17,525 --> 01:37:19,584
觉得牧场的人还土的半死
Boy, were we behind the times.

875
01:37:36,678 --> 01:37:39,146
小艾玛，准备好了？
(Ennis) Hey there, Junior. You ready?

876
01:37:54,229 --> 01:37:55,491
你觉得怎样？
(Cassie) What do you think?

877
01:37:56,731 --> 01:37:59,325
你爸有想再成家吗？
Your daddy ever gonna see fit to settle down again?

878
01:38:01,402 --> 01:38:04,735
不知，也许他不适合婚姻
Don't know. Maybe he's not the marrying kind.

879
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:09,399
你不这么想？
You don't think so?

880
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:14,145
还是你不认为我适合他？
Or you don't think I'm the one for him?

881
01:38:15,617 --> 01:38:16,743
你算不错了
You're good enough.

882
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:24,881
你话不多，却很坦白
You don't say much, but you get your point across.

883
01:38:27,929 --> 01:38:29,897
抱歉，我无意失礼
Sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

884
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,492
好了
All right.

885
01:38:34,969 --> 01:38:37,096
你踩到我的脚了，牛仔
You're stayin' on your feet, cowboy.

886
01:38:37,973 --> 01:38:39,463
对不起，亲爱的
Excuse me, darling.

887
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:04,557
我下周末去接你跟珍妮吧
So I'll pick you and Jenny up next weekend,

888
01:39:04,699 --> 01:39:06,690
做完礼拜之后
after church.

889
01:39:08,102 --> 01:39:09,034
好
Fine.

890
01:39:13,007 --> 01:39:13,939
你还好吧？
You all right?

891
01:39:15,843 --> 01:39:16,810
很好
Yes.

892
01:39:17,879 --> 01:39:19,039
你确定？
Are you sure?

893
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:25,681
爸，我在想那个新宝宝的事
Daddy, I was thinking, what with the new baby and all...

894
01:39:25,787 --> 01:39:28,051
妈和蒙洛对我很严
Ma and Monroe have been awful strict on me.

895
01:39:28,289 --> 01:39:30,086
比对珍妮还严
More on me than Jenny even.

896
01:39:31,426 --> 01:39:33,587
我在想，也许我可以
I was thinkin', maybe I could....

897
01:39:35,997 --> 01:39:37,862
我可以跟你一起住
Maybe I could come stay with you.

898
01:39:39,334 --> 01:39:42,201
我会是个好帮手，我知道的
I'd be an awful good help, I know I would.

899
01:39:42,537 --> 01:39:46,166
你知道，我没办法过那种生活
Now, you know I ain't set up for that.

900
01:39:47,442 --> 01:39:52,539
等我去赶牲口时，就不会在家
With the roundup comin'... I won't ever be home.

901
01:39:53,548 --> 01:39:54,776
没关系，爸
It's all right, Daddy.

902
01:39:55,683 --> 01:39:56,581
我不是说我不想
I'm not sayin' that I wouldn't--

903
01:39:56,718 --> 01:39:58,276
没关系，我明白
 It's all right, I understand.

904
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,452
那就周日见了
Well, see you on Sunday, then.

905
01:40:05,293 --> 01:40:06,282
拜
Bye.

906
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:10,261
拜，乖女儿
Bye, sweetheart.

907
01:40:40,128 --> 01:40:41,823
今晚肯定会下雪
Going to snow tonight for sure.

908
01:40:43,664 --> 01:40:44,596
是啊
Yup.

909
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:55,207
这些日子 你还没找到再婚对象？
All this time and you ain't found nobody else to marry?

910
01:40:57,578 --> 01:41:01,378
我跟镇上一个美女在交往
I been puttin' the blocks... to a good-lookin' little gAl over in Riverton.

911
01:41:03,418 --> 01:41:04,942
她是个服务生
She's a waitress.

912
01:41:05,186 --> 01:41:07,381
想去念护校之类的
Wants to go to nursing school or somethin'.

913
01:41:10,191 --> 01:41:16,653
我不知道，你跟萝琳呢？
I don't know. What about you and Lureen?

914
01:41:19,134 --> 01:41:22,068
萝琳很会谈生意
Lureen's good at making hard deAls in the machinery business...

915
01:41:22,203 --> 01:41:24,000
不过我们的婚姻状况
but as far as our marriage goes...

916
01:41:25,473 --> 01:41:27,100
讲讲电话就行了
we could do it over the phone.

917
01:41:37,618 --> 01:41:43,417
我跟一个牧场工头的老婆有染
I kind of got this thing going with... a ranch foreman's wife over in Rutters.

918
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:45,527
每次我溜去见她
What? I'm bound to get shot...

919
01:41:45,527 --> 01:41:49,092
都可能被活逮毙命
by Lureen or her husband each time I slip off to see her.

920
01:41:49,597 --> 01:41:52,031
你可能也活该
You probably deserve it.

921
01:41:59,507 --> 01:42:00,405
告诉你
Tell you what.

922
01:42:06,247 --> 01:42:07,441
事实上
The truth is...

923
01:42:14,655 --> 01:42:17,954
有时我好想你，想到无法承受
sometimes I miss you so much, I can hardly stand it.

924
01:43:00,301 --> 01:43:02,496
我想我会回老家去一两天
I guess I'll head up on to Lightning Flat.

925
01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:06,203
看看我父母
See the folks for a day or two.

926
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:14,980
我有话一直想告诉你
There's somethin' I been meanin' to tell you, bud.

927
01:43:19,954 --> 01:43:22,821
等我们十一月运走牲口之前
Well, it's likely November before I can come out here again.

928
01:43:25,226 --> 01:43:31,426
我都不会有空再来这 在冬季饲养开始之前
After we ship stock and before winter feedin' starts again.

929
01:43:34,969 --> 01:43:36,061
十一月
November.

930
01:43:37,972 --> 01:43:39,166
是啊
Yup

931
01:43:40,241 --> 01:43:42,334
那八月怎么办？
What in the hell ever happened to August?

932
01:43:43,311 --> 01:43:44,300
好把
Well....

933
01:43:47,949 --> 01:43:49,075
天哪，艾尼斯
Christ, Ennis.

934
01:43:55,489 --> 01:43:58,185
你有一个礼拜可以告诉我的
You know, you had a fucking week to say some little word about this.

935
01:44:01,996 --> 01:44:04,521
我们干嘛老到这么冷的地方
Why is it we're Always in the friggin' cold?

936
01:44:04,699 --> 01:44:07,224
我们该去温暖的南方
We ought to go south where it's warm, you know!

937
01:44:07,368 --> 01:44:08,699
我们应该要去墨西哥
We ought to go to Mexico.

938
01:44:10,204 --> 01:44:11,296
墨西哥？
Mexico?

939
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,738
杰克，你知道我的
Hell, Jack, you know me. About all the travelin' I ever done...

940
01:44:13,874 --> 01:44:17,071
我从来没去过多远的地方
is around a coffee pot, looking for the handle.

941
01:44:20,815 --> 01:44:22,715
拜托，杰克，别逼我
(Ennis) Come on, Jack. Lighten up on me.

942
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:27,150
我们可以在十一月打猎
We can hunt in November.

943
01:44:28,055 --> 01:44:29,613
猎只大麋鹿
Kill us a nice elk.

944
01:44:32,293 --> 01:44:33,726
我会设法再跟老唐借小木屋
I'll try if I can get Don Wroe's cabin again.

945
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:36,056
我们那年很快乐，对吧？
We had a good time that year, didn't we?

946
01:44:39,467 --> 01:44:42,129
时间永远不够，永远不够
There's never enough time, never enough.

947
01:44:46,807 --> 01:44:52,609
这该死的状况真令人不满
You know, friend... this is a goddamn bitch of an unsatisfactory situation.

948
01:44:54,048 --> 01:44:55,572
你以前出来都很轻松
You used to come away easy.

949
01:44:55,716 --> 01:44:57,479
现在却像晋见教宗一样
Now it's like seein' the Pope.

950
01:45:00,655 --> 01:45:02,122
杰克，我得工作
Jack, I got to work.

951
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:08,390
早些年，我会干脆辞了工作
In them earlier days, I'd just quit the job.

952
01:45:11,265 --> 01:45:15,965
你忘了贫穷日子的感觉了
You.... You forget what it's like bein' broke all the time.

953
01:45:20,174 --> 01:45:22,142
你听说过扶养子女吗？
You ever hear of chiId support?

954
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,978
我告诉你，我不能辞掉这工作
I'll tell you this, I can't quit this one...

955
01:45:29,116 --> 01:45:31,016
我也不能请假
and I can't get the time off.

956
01:45:34,555 --> 01:45:38,150
这次已经够难了，得牺牲八月
It was hard enough gettin' this time. The trade-off was August.

957
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:44,188
你有更好的主意吗？
Well, you got a better idea?

958
01:45:47,168 --> 01:45:50,069
我有，曾经
I did, once.

959
01:45:51,005 --> 01:45:52,597
曾经？
(Ennis) You did, once.

960
01:45:57,211 --> 01:45:59,270
你到过墨西哥了？
Well, have you been to Mexico, Jack Twist?

961
01:46:02,283 --> 01:46:05,446
我听说墨西哥有服务你们的人
'Cause I hear what they got in Mexico for boys like you.

962
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:10,183
我是到过那里，有问题吗？
Hell, yes, I've been to Mexico. Is that a fucking problem?

963
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:21,860
我只打算告诉你这一次
I'm going to tell you this one time, Jack fucking Twist.

964
01:46:22,603 --> 01:46:23,900
我不是笨蛋
And I ain't foolin'.

965
01:46:25,773 --> 01:46:28,503
那些你背着我做 我不知道的事
What I don't know, all them things that I don't know...

966
01:46:28,642 --> 01:46:32,738
如果我知道的话 你也别想活命了
could get you killed if I come to know them.

967
01:46:37,051 --> 01:46:38,382
我可不是开玩笑
I ain't jokin'.

968
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:46,018
试试看吧，我就说这么一次
Yeah, well try this one, and I'll say it just once.

969
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,149
说啊
Go ahead! I'll tell you what.

970
01:46:47,928 --> 01:46:50,055
我们本可以共度美好人生
We could have had a good life together.

971
01:46:50,197 --> 01:46:53,598
美好人生，有个共同的家
Fucking reAl good life. Had us a place of our own!

972
01:46:54,468 --> 01:46:56,459
不过你却不想要
But you didn't want it, Ennis.

973
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:59,605
现在我们只剩下断背山了
So what we got now is Brokeback Mountain!

974
01:47:01,642 --> 01:47:02,973
一切都建在那之上
Everything's buiIt on that!

975
01:47:03,110 --> 01:47:04,236
那是我们所拥有的一切
That's all we got, boy. Fucking all.

976
01:47:04,378 --> 01:47:07,348
所以我希望你别知道实情
So I hope you know that, if you don't never know the rest!

977
01:47:07,348 --> 01:47:09,949
你数数我们才在一起多少次
God damn it. You count the damn few times...

978
01:47:10,084 --> 01:47:11,881
我们已经在一起20年了
that we have been together in nearly 20 years...

979
01:47:12,019 --> 01:47:15,589
你紧紧拴住我 问我墨西哥的事
and you measure the short fucking leash you keep me on and then you ask me about Mexico and you tell me you'll kill me

980
01:47:15,589 --> 01:47:19,025
为我追寻我得不到的东西 要杀我
for needin' somethin' I don't hardly never get!

981
01:47:22,396 --> 01:47:26,162
你根本不知道这有多难受
You have no idea how bad it gets!

982
01:47:29,036 --> 01:47:30,060
我不是你
And I'm not you! I can't make it...

983
01:47:30,204 --> 01:47:35,301
我没办法靠那一两次撑一整年
on a couple of high-Altitude fucks once or twice a year!

984
01:47:38,212 --> 01:47:43,013
你令我无法忍受，你这个混蛋
You are too much for me, Ennis. You son of a whoreson bitch!

985
01:47:45,619 --> 01:47:47,814
我真希望知道该怎么离开你
I wish I knew how to quit you!

986
01:47:50,424 --> 01:47:51,755
那你干嘛不离开？
Then why don't you?

987
01:47:55,129 --> 01:47:56,721
你干嘛不干脆丢下我呢？
Why don't you just let me be, huh?

988
01:47:59,667 --> 01:48:01,999
这全都是因为你，我变成这样
It's because of you, Jack, that I'm like this.

989
01:48:06,273 --> 01:48:09,674
我什么都不是，无处可去
I'm nothin'. I'm nowhere.

990
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:16,907
没事了 少理我
It's okay. Get the fuck off me!

991
01:48:17,818 --> 01:48:18,716
过来！
Come here

992
01:48:23,891 --> 01:48:26,519
没关系…没事了
It's all right. It's all right.

993
01:48:27,695 --> 01:48:29,856
没事了，艾尼斯
Damn you, Ennis.

994
01:48:30,898 --> 01:48:33,389
我再也受不了了
I just can't stand this anymore, Jack.

995
01:48:43,711 --> 01:48:46,805
来吧 你像马一样卷缩着脚睡觉
Come on now, you're sleepin' on your feet like a horse.

996
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:52,213
小时候我妈曾这么说过我
My mama used to say that to me when I was little.

997
01:48:53,787 --> 01:48:55,652
还唱歌给我听
And sing to me.

998
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:15,270
我要走了，早上见
I got to go. See you in the morning.

999
01:50:10,798 --> 01:50:11,992
抱歉
Excuse me.

1000
01:50:19,206 --> 01:50:20,833
艾尼斯戴尔玛
Ennis Del Mar.

1001
01:50:24,345 --> 01:50:25,539
你去哪了？
Where you been?

1002
01:50:27,715 --> 01:50:29,080
到处跑
Here and there.

1003
01:50:31,952 --> 01:50:35,581
我在牧场留过话给你
I left word for you with Steve at the ranch.

1004
01:50:35,923 --> 01:50:39,552
你一定有收到 我留在你家的字条
And you must've got those notes I left at your place.

1005
01:50:42,963 --> 01:50:45,523
看来我有没收到都无所谓
Looks like I got the message, in any case.

1006
01:50:48,035 --> 01:50:55,271
卡尔？卡尔很好，他会说话
Carl? Yeah, Carl's nice. He even talks.

1007
01:50:58,579 --> 01:50:59,841
那很好
Good for you.

1008
01:51:02,349 --> 01:51:08,083
是啊，是很好
Yeah. Good for me.

1009
01:51:14,328 --> 01:51:16,694
我真不明白你，艾尼斯
I don't get you, Ennis Del Mar.

1010
01:51:22,269 --> 01:51:23,600
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1011
01:51:31,845 --> 01:51:34,609
我可能不够风趣，对吧？
I was probably no fun anyways, was I?

1012
01:51:37,818 --> 01:51:40,878
让女人坠入爱河的不是风趣
Ennis, girls don't fall in love with fun.

1013
01:52:14,988 --> 01:52:18,185
（亡故）

1014
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,462
喂？
(Lureen) Hello. Hello,

1015
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:27,497
我是…艾尼斯戴尔玛
this is Ennis Del Mar.

1016
01:52:30,404 --> 01:52:32,770
谁？你是谁？
Who? Who is this?

1017
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,509
艾尼斯戴尔玛，杰克的老朋友
Ennis Del Mar. I'm an old buddy of Jack's.

1018
01:52:37,578 --> 01:52:39,068
杰克曾提起过你
(Lureen) Jack used to mention you.

1019
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,577
你是他钓鱼还是打猎的朋友
You're the fishing buddy or the hunting buddy, I know that.

1020
01:52:44,718 --> 01:52:45,810
我该让你知道发生了什么事
Would have let you know what happened...

1021
01:52:45,953 --> 01:52:49,286
不过我不确定你的姓名或地址
but I wasn't sure about your name or address.

1022
01:52:49,456 --> 01:52:52,152
杰克把朋友的地址都存在脑里
Jack kept his friends' addresses in his head.

1023
01:52:53,894 --> 01:52:57,455
所以我才打来问个究竟
That's why I'm callin', to see what happened.

1024
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:05,272
是啊，杰克当时在帮轮胎打气
Oh, yeah. Jack was pumpin' up a flat on the truck...

1025
01:53:05,272 --> 01:53:08,469
轮胎爆炸时他就在旁边
out on a back road, when the tire blew up.

1026
01:53:08,809 --> 01:53:11,243
轮圈直接砸中他的脸
The rim of the tire slammed into his face...

1027
01:53:11,845 --> 01:53:13,642
砸断他的鼻梁和下巴
broke his nose and jaw

1028
01:53:13,847 --> 01:53:16,315
还把他砸的当场昏倒
and knocked him unconscious on his back.

1029
01:53:16,984 --> 01:53:18,713
等有人发现他时
By the time somebody come along,

1030
01:53:18,852 --> 01:53:21,616
他已经被自己的血给淹死了
 he'd drowned in his own blood.

1031
01:53:21,788 --> 01:53:24,348
他享年39岁
He was only 39 years old.

1032
01:53:28,228 --> 01:53:29,320
喂？
Hello? Hello?

1033
01:53:30,364 --> 01:53:32,832
喂？喂？
Hello.

1034
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:38,437
他葬在那里吗？
Was he buried down there?

1035
01:53:39,606 --> 01:53:40,800
我们立了石碑
We put a stone up.

1036
01:53:41,508 --> 01:53:43,408
依他所愿火化了他
He was cremated, like he wanted.

1037
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:45,200
一半的骨灰葬在这里
HAlf his ashes was interred here

1038
01:53:45,579 --> 01:53:47,672
其余的则送到他父母手上
the rest was sent up with his folks.

1039
01:53:49,049 --> 01:53:53,042
他曾说他想将骨灰  在断背山
He use to say he wanted his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain...

1040
01:53:53,287 --> 01:53:56,222
不过我不确定那在哪里
but I wasn't sure where that was.

1041
01:53:56,356 --> 01:53:58,984
我以为断背山可能在他家乡
I thought Brokeback Mountain might be around where he grew up.

1042
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,018
够了解杰克
Knowing Jack...

1043
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:03,391
就知道那可能是个想像的地方
it might be some pretend place...

1044
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:06,829
那里有蓝鸟歌唱，威士忌迎春
where bluebirds sing and there's a whiskey spring.

1045
01:54:10,003 --> 01:54:11,231
不，夫人
No, ma'am...

1046
01:54:12,306 --> 01:54:15,673
我们某年夏天曾在那里牧羊
we was herdin' sheep on Brokeback one summer...

1047
01:54:16,176 --> 01:54:18,007
就在1963年
back in '63.

1048
01:54:26,954 --> 01:54:29,821
他说过那是他最爱的地方
Well, he said it was his favorite place.

1049
01:54:31,058 --> 01:54:34,357
我以为他喝醉了，他常喝醉
I thought he meant to get drunk. He drank a lot.

1050
01:54:37,231 --> 01:54:40,632
他父母是不是住莱飞镇？
Is his folks still up in Lightning Flat?

1051
01:54:41,268 --> 01:54:43,566
他们到死也不会离开那里的
They'll be there till the day they die.

1052
01:54:48,675 --> 01:54:50,575
谢谢你的说明
Thank you for your time.

1053
01:54:51,612 --> 01:54:56,606
我很遗憾，我们以前是好朋友
I sure am sorry. We was good friends.

1054
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:05,024
跟他父母联络吧
Get in touch with his folks.

1055
01:55:05,492 --> 01:55:07,119
我想他们会很感激的
I suppose they'd appreciate it

1056
01:55:07,261 --> 01:55:09,320
如果他的愿望能实现的话
 if his wishes was carried out.

1057
01:55:11,231 --> 01:55:13,256
我是说骨灰的事
About the ashes, I mean.

1058
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,623
要喝杯咖啡、吃块蛋糕吗？
Want a cup of coffee, don't you? Piece of cherry cake?

1059
01:56:17,798 --> 01:56:20,631
好的，我喝咖啡 但吃不下蛋糕
Yes, ma'am, I'll have a cup of coffee... but I can't eat no cake just now.

1060
01:56:20,767 --> 01:56:21,961
谢谢
Thank you.

1061
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:32,938
杰克的事我很遗憾
I feel awful bad about Jack.

1062
01:56:36,183 --> 01:56:37,309
谢谢
Thank you.

1063
01:56:39,286 --> 01:56:41,481
我无法说明我有多哀伤
I can't begin to tell you how bad I feel.

1064
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:46,251
我认识他很久了
(Ennis) I knew him a long time.

1065
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:51,056
我是来问一声
I come by to say that...

1066
01:56:52,432 --> 01:56:55,367
是否需要 我带他的骨灰去断背山
if you want me to take his ashes up there on Brokeback...

1067
01:56:56,803 --> 01:56:58,964
他太太说他有这个愿望
like his wife said he wanted to...

1068
01:57:00,006 --> 01:57:01,473
我很乐意代劳
then I'll be happy to.

1069
01:57:05,045 --> 01:57:06,239
我告诉你吧
I'll tell you what.

1070
01:57:07,781 --> 01:57:10,409
我知道断背山在哪
I know where Brokeback Mountain is.

1071
01:57:11,451 --> 01:57:15,319
他自以为特别 不该葬家族墓园
Thought he was too goddamn speciAl to be buried in the family plot.

1072
01:57:19,092 --> 01:57:23,153
杰克曾说，艾尼斯戴尔玛
(John) Jack used to say....''Ennis Del Mar,''

1073
01:57:23,296 --> 01:57:24,490
他曾说过
 he used to say.

1074
01:57:25,999 --> 01:57:28,991
我总有一天要带他上去
''I'm gonna bring him up here one of these days...

1075
01:57:29,803 --> 01:57:32,966
我们会一起建一个牧场
''and we'll lick this damn ranch into shape.''

1076
01:57:34,207 --> 01:57:36,038
他有些不成熟的想法
He had some hAlf-baked notion...

1077
