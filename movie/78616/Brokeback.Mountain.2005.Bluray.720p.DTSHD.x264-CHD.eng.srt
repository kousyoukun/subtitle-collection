Them camps can be 3, 4 miles from where we pasture the woollies.

Bad predator loss if there's nobody lookin' after 'em at night.

Now, what l want is a camp tender...

to stay in the main camp, where the Forest Service says.

But the herder...

13

he's gonna pitch a pup tent on the QT with the sheep...

and he's gonna sleep there.

one curve in the road in 43 miles, and they miss it.
