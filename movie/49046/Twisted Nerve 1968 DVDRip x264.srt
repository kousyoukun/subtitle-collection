Roses then, eh?

-“向那个殖民总督开枪”

But I tell you one thing...

you'll never make
it unpopular!

454
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,398
Oh well, if you'll excuse
me, Mrs Harper...

455
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,498
I have some studies.

to them, can you?

No sense of humour.
一点幽默细胞都没有

463
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,498
Don't be discouraged...
别这样

464
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,599
He's probably up there
laughing his head off.
他有可能在楼上自己笑得个半死呢

465
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,699

479
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,399
Oh, Mum...

or on the house, for
that matter.

so sit down.

968
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,198
I wouldn't read that
if I was you.
我是你我就不会读它

969
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,299
Won't want to touch a
thing after that. Horrible!
都不想碰一下，太恐怖了！

970
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,499
Oh! Banker brutally
murdered.
噢！银行家被残忍杀害

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,198
Well, that's closed
his account!
估计是冲着他的钱吧！

975
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,399
There's none of us safe these
days, if you ask me.
要我说，现在这世道谁都不安全

976
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,598
Not since they give
up hanging.
自从他们取消绞刑之后

977
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,798
No, and we won't be
'til they bring it back either.
对啊，除非他们又承认绞刑

978
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,898
You mark my words!

be one of these...

'Psychopaths', Mrs Clark?
你指的是“精神病人”，Clark太太？

983
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,399
That's it!
对，就是那个

984
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,698
I don't give a damn what
his religion is... I'd top 'im!
我才不管他信什么教，我会解决他的！

985
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,799
But if he is a psychopath,
he's a very sick man.
但是如果他是精神病的话，他就是一个非常病态的人了
（指死掉的银行家）

986
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,899
Who says so?

I'll tell you something...

that makes <i>me</i> sick!

What about... this, err...
你干嘛不..这个...呃..

990
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,598
Durnley chap. What aboutfeeling
sorry for him then, eh?!
这个叫Durnley的家伙，你干嘛不直接为

991
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,798
Look, of course I
feel sorry for him...

it's easy when
a man's dead.

You can see it.
你懂这道理的

995
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,498
But how about a man who
can feeling nothing for anyone...
但是如果一个人，只活在自己的世界里

996
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,499
except for himself?
不为别人着想

997
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,798
Who doesn't know
what love is...
不明白爱是什么

998
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,899
or pity, who has
no conscience.
遗憾是什么，一个人没良知的人

999
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,099
Who's only feeling is
of rage, when frustrated.
一个在受挫时只感到愤怒的人

1000
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,299
And only fun, destroying
those who frustrate him.
他唯一的乐趣，就是毁掉那个让些他受挫的人

1001
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,598
Now, it's hard to feel
sorry for him, isn't it?
现在，还为他感到遗憾吗？

And there very few
of us who can help him.
我们都不能帮到他

1005
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,099
Sphericals!

1006
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,299
If he's off his trolley,
I still say 'top 'im'!
要是他侥幸免于一死
我还是坚持解决他

1007
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,499
Here we are. Morning
